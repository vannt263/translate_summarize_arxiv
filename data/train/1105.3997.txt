    "superconducting circuits with josephson junctions are steadily gaining attention as promising candidates for the realization of a quantum computer @xcite . over the last several years , significant progress has been made in preparing , controlling , and measuring the macroscopic quantum states of such circuits @xcite .",
    "however , the two major roadblocks  scalability and decoherence  still remain , impeding the development of a workable prototype .",
    "the resonator / zero - qubit ( rezqu ) protocol presented here aims to address these limitations at a low - level ( hardware cell ) architecture @xcite .",
    "a rezqu device consists of a set of superconducting qubits ( e.g. , phase qubits @xcite ) , each of which is capacitively coupled to its own memory resonator and also capacitively coupled to a common resonator bus , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] @xcite .",
    "the bus is used for coupling operations between qubits , while the memory resonators are used for information storage when the logic qubits are idling . with coupling capacitors being fixed and relatively small",
    ", qubit coupling is adjusted by varying the qubit frequency , which is brought in and out of resonance with the two resonators . for a one - qubit operation",
    ", quantum information is moved from the memory to the qubit , where a microwave pulse is applied .",
    "a natural two - qubit operation is the controlled-@xmath0 gate , for which one qubit state is moved to the bus , while the other qubit frequency is tuned close to resonance with the bus for a precise duration @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the information stored in resonators is separated from the rest of the processing circuit by the known qubit state @xmath1 and at least two coupling steps , thus reducing crosstalk error during idling .",
    "also , the problem of spectral crowding is essentially eliminated because the two - step resonance between empty qubits is not harmful , while the four - step coupling between memory resonators is negligible .",
    "therefore the resonator frequencies , which are set by fabrication , can be close to each other , decreasing sensitivity to phase errors in the clock .",
    "thus the rezqu architecture essentially solves the inherent on / off ratio problem of the _ fixed _ capacitive coupling without using a more complicated scheme of a tunable coupling @xcite . as an additional benefit ,",
    "information storage in resonators increases coherence time compared to storage in the qubits .",
    "we note that the idea of using resonators to couple qubits has been suggested by many authors @xcite . the use of resonators as quantum memories has also been previously proposed @xcite .",
    "however , putting the two ideas together in a single architecture results in the new qualitative advantages , which have not been discussed .",
    "schematic diagram of the rezqu architecture : @xmath2  memory resonators , @xmath3  qubits , @xmath4  bus .",
    "we assume frequencies @xmath57 ghz for the memories , @xmath56 ghz for the bus , and qubit frequencies are varied between these values . ]    in this paper we briefly consider the relation between the logical and the physical qubit states and then analyze several basic operations in the rezqu architecture .",
    "in particular , for a truncated three - component memory - qubit - bus rezqu device we focus on the idling error , information transfer ( move ) between the qubit and its memory , and the tunneling measurement .",
    "the analysis of the controlled-@xmath0 gate will be presented elsewhere @xcite . for simplicity decoherence",
    "is neglected .",
    "we begin by recalling an important difference between logical and actual , physical qubits .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that in the language of quantum circuit diagrams the idling qubits are always presumed to be stationary , while superconducting qubits evolve with a 6 - 7 ghz frequency even in idling , which leads to accumulation of relative phases .",
    "also , the always - on coupling leads to fast small - amplitude oscillations of the `` bare''-state populations during the off - resonant idling . a natural way to avoid the latter problem is to _ define _ logical multi - qubit states to be the ( dressed ) _ eigenstates _ of the whole system ( see e.g. , @xcite for discussion of the dressed states ) .",
    "then the only evolution in idling is the phase accumulation for each logic state .",
    "however , there are @xmath6 logic states for @xmath7 qubits , and using @xmath6 `` local clocks '' ( rotating frames ) would require an exponential overhead to calibrate the phases .",
    "the present - day experiments with two or three qubits often use this unscalable way , but it will not work for @xmath8 .",
    "a scalable way is to choose only @xmath7 rotating frames , which correspond to one - qubit logical states , and treat the frequencies of multi - qubit states only approximately , as sums of the corresponding single - qubit frequencies .",
    "the use of such non - exact rotating frames for multi - qubit states leads to what we call an idling error , which is analyzed in the next section .",
    "notice that it is sufficient to establish a correspondence between logical and physical states only at some time moments between the gates .",
    "moreover , this correspondence may be different at different moments . at those moments ,",
    "the bus is empty , the @xmath9 system components ( @xmath7 qubits , @xmath7 memories , and the bus ) are well - detuned from their neighbors , and for each logical qubit it is unambiguously known whether the corresponding quantum information is located in the memory or in the qubit .",
    "thus the eigenstates corresponding to the logical states are well - defined and the physical - to - logical correspondence is naturally established by projecting onto the @xmath6 computational eigenstates , while occupations of other eigenstates should be regarded as an error . in the simplest modular construction of an algorithm we should not attempt to correct the error of a given gate by the subsequent gates . then for the overall error we only need to characterize the errors of individual gates , as well as the idling error",
    ".    one may think that defining logical states via the eigenstates of the whole system may present a technical problem in an algorithm design . however , this is not really a problem for the following reasons .",
    "first , we need the conversion into the basis of eigenstates only at the start and end of a quantum gate , while the design of a gate is modular and can be done using any convenient basis .",
    "second , in practice , we can truncate the system to calculate the eigenstates approximately , making sure that the error due to truncation is sufficiently small .",
    "similar truncation with a limited error is needed in practical gate design .",
    "as mentioned above , the physical - to - logical correspondence rule can be different at every point between the gates . for the correspondence based on eigenstates we are free to choose @xmath7 single - excitation phases arbitrarily . in spite of this freedom , for definiteness",
    ", it makes sense to relate all the single - excitation phases to a particular fixed time moment in an algorithm",
    ". then a shift of the gate start time leads to easily calculable phase shifts , which accumulate with the frequencies equal to the change of single - excitation frequencies before and after the gate .",
    "such shift is useful for the adjustment of relative single - excitation phases @xcite .",
    "another way of the single - excitation phase adjustment is by using `` qubit frequency excursions '' @xcite .",
    "the ease of these adjustments significantly simplifies design of quantum gates , because we essentially should not wary about the single - excitation phases .",
    "notice that initial generation of high - fidelity single - excitation eigenstates is much easier experimentally than generation of the bare states .",
    "this is because a typical duration of the qubit excitation pulses is significantly longer than inverse detuning between the qubit and resonators .",
    "we have checked this advantage of using eigenstates versus bare states numerically in a simple model with typical parameters @xcite of a rezqu device ( the error decrease is about two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "similarly , the standard one - qubit operations essentially operate with the eigenstates rather than with the bare states .",
    "before discussing the idling error in the rezqu architecture , let us consider a simpler case of two directly coupled qubits .",
    "then in idling the wavefunction evolves as @xmath10 , where we denote the logical ( eigen)states with an overline , their corresponding ( eigen)energies with @xmath11 , and amplitudes at @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "however , for the desired evolution @xmath14 the last term should be replaced with @xmath15 ; then only two rotating frames ( clocks ) with frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 are needed .",
    "we see that the phase difference accumulates with the frequency @xmath18 , and therefore the idling error due to qubit coupling accumulates over a time @xmath19 as @xmath20 where we assumed @xmath21 .",
    "( the frequency @xmath22 is defined in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite for a two - qubit @xmath23 interaction . )",
    "the error is state - dependent , but in this paper we will always consider error estimates for the worst - case scenario .    in the rezqu architecture ,",
    "the main contribution to the idling error comes from interaction between a memory resonator , in which quantum information is stored , and the bus , which is constantly used for quantum gates between other qubits . by analogy with the above case , for the truncated memory - qubit - bus ( @xmath24 ) system",
    "the idling error can be estimated as [ eq : idlingerrorfrequency ] err ( _ zzt)^2 , _ zz = ( _ 101 - _ 001 ) - ( _ 100 - _ 000 ) , where the eigenenergies correspond to the logical eigenstates @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and in our @xmath29 notation the sequence of symbols represents the states of the memory resonator , the qubit , and the bus .",
    "notice that the qubit here is always in state @xmath1 , and @xmath22 is essentially the difference between the effective frequencies of the memory resonator in the presence and absence of the bus excitation .    to find @xmath22",
    "we use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ; then the dynamics of the @xmath24 system is described by the hamiltonian ( we use @xmath30 ) @xmath31 where the qubit frequency @xmath32 may vary in time , while the qubit anharmonicity @xmath33 is assumed to be constant , _",

    "the last term in eq .",

[ g_d]it is typically smaller than the effective memory - bus coupling via the virtual excitation of the qubit because the detunings @xmath42 and @xmath43 between the elements are much smaller than their frequencies ; because of that , we often neglect @xmath44 . from the physical model it is easy to show that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are proportional to @xmath45 and therefore change when the qubit frequency is varied",
    "; however for simplicity we will assume constant @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "neglecting @xmath44 , in fourth order we find ( see appendix ) , @xmath46 which is very close to the exact value found by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , and the effect of @xmath44 is of a higher order and therefore very small ( see appendix and fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath47 because in a linear system @xmath48 , and nonlinearity comes from the qubit .",
    "equation ( [ eq : omegazz_4th_order ] ) shows that an optimal choice of the qubit `` parked '' frequency is @xmath49 , midway between the memory and the bus frequencies ; then the idling error in this order goes to zero ( this happens because the contribution of @xmath50 in @xmath51 becomes zero  see appendix ) .",
    "notice that in the rezqu architecture the frequencies of the memory resonators are assumed to be relatively close to each other ( forming a `` memory band '' of frequencies ) .",
    "then the optimal `` parked '' frequencies of the qubits are also close to each other .",
    "this is not a problem when all qubits are in state @xmath1 ; however , when a qubit is excited this may lead to a significant resonant coupling with another qubit via the bus . to avoid this `` spectral crowding '' effect",
    ", it is useful to reserve two additional frequencies , situated sufficiently far from the `` parked '' frequencies , at which a pair of qubits may undergo local rotations ( simultaneous rotations of two qubits are often useful before and after two - qubit gates ) .",
    "( color online ) the frequency @xmath22 for a truncated memory - qubit - bus system [ the idling error is @xmath52 for two values of the coupling : @xmath53 mhz ( blue lines ) and @xmath54 mhz ( red lines ) .",

    "the effect of @xmath44 is not visible ( smaller than the line thickness ) .",
    "the blue and red dashed lines show the analytical result ( [ eq : omegazz_4th_order ] ) . ]",
    "the idling error ( [ eq : idlingerrorfrequency ] ) scales quadratically with time .",
    "this is because we use a definition for which not the error itself but its square root corresponds to a metric , and therefore for a composition of quantum gates in the worst - case scenario we should sum square roots of the errors .",
    "for the same reason , the worst - case idling error scales quadratically , @xmath55 , with the number @xmath7 of qubits in a rezqu device . in principle",
    ", an average idling error may scale linearly with @xmath7 and time ( for that we would need to define the memory `` clock '' frequency using an average occupation of the bus ) ; however , here we use only the worst - case analysis .",
    "it is convenient to replace the time - dependence in the idling error estimate @xmath56 by the dependence on the number of operations @xmath57 in an algorithm .",
    "( the corresponding quadratic dependence on @xmath57 can also be interpreted as the worst - case - scenario error for a composition of quantum operations . ) assuming that each operation crudely takes time @xmath58 ( this estimate comes from move operations discussed later and also from controlled-@xmath0 gate ) and neglecting the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegazz_4th_order ] ) ( i.e.assuming non - optimal `` parked '' qubit frequencies ) , we obtain the following estimate for the worst - case idling error : [ eq : ie - rezqu ] err , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are typical detunings at idling . using for an estimate @xmath61 mhz , @xmath62 mhz , and @xmath63 mhz , we obtain @xmath64 .    to demonstrate the advantage of the rezqu architecture , eq.([eq : ie - rezqu ] ) may be compared with the corresponding result for the conventional bus - based architecture ( without additional memories ) .",
    "then the idling error is due to @xmath65-interaction between the qubit and the bus : the frequency of an idling qubit is affected by the bus occupation due to logic operations between other qubits . in this case",

    "assuming a typical ratio @xmath67 between the coupling and detuning , we have a reduction in the idling error in the rezqu architecture by at least @xmath68 even before considering that @xmath22 can be zeroed in this order . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ie - standard ] ) we see that a conventional architecture allows only a very modest number of qubits and operations before the idling error becomes significant . in principle , the problem can be solved by a constantly running dynamical decoupling ( which would be quite nontrivial in a multi - qubit device ) .",
    "the rezqu idea eliminates the need for such dynamical decoupling .",
    "all our estimates so far were for the idling error due to the memory - bus interaction .",
    "now let us discuss errors due to the four - step memory - memory interaction in the rezqu architecture .",

    "the @xmath69-interaction does not produce a phase error accumulating in idling , but leads to the error @xmath72 every time the information is retrieved from memory , where @xmath73 is the typical spacing between memory frequencies .",
    "assuming similar sections of the rezqu device with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we obtain an error estimate @xmath76 per operation . since the worst - case scaling with the number of operations @xmath57 is always @xmath77 , we obtain the worst - case estimate n^2 n_op^2g_m^4 g_b^4 /^8 .",
    "[ err - m - m1]this error is smaller than the idling error ( [ eq : ie - rezqu ] ) if @xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    "we find a very small error @xmath80 , which means that there is essentially no spectral crowding problem for memories .",
    "notice that for a conventional bus - based architecture the error estimate ( [ err - m - m1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath81 and presents a difficult scaling problem due to the spectral crowding .",
    "besides the @xmath69-interaction between the two memories , there is also the @xmath65-interaction . using the same approximate derivation as in appendix",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ omega_zz - eta ] ) ] and assuming @xmath82 , we find an estimate @xmath83 . then using @xmath84 ( the scaling @xmath85 is because each pair brings a contribution ) , with @xmath86",
    ", we obtain the worst - case estimate .",
    "[ err - m-2]this error is smaller than the memory - bus idling error ( [ eq : ie - rezqu ] ) if @xmath87 , which is always the case in practice .",
    "any logic gate in the rezqu architecture requires moving quantum information from one system element ( memory , qubit , bus ) to another .",
    "therefore the move operation is the most frequent one .",
    "it is important to mention that the one - way move operation is easier to design than the swap ( or @xmath88swap ) operation because we are not interested in the fidelity of the reverse transfer and can also assume zero occupation of the neighboring element .",
    "for example , for a perfect qubit@xmath89memory move ( @xmath88move ) operation in the truncated @xmath24 system we search for a unitary , which transforms @xmath90 ( notice that in rwa @xmath91 always ) , but we are not interested in what happens to the initial states @xmath26 and @xmath27 . moreover , we can allow for an arbitrary phase , @xmath92 , because this phase can be compensated either by shifting the operation start time within one period of the initial memory - qubit detuning @xcite or by `` qubit frequency excursion '' with proper integral @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to satisfy only two ( complex ) equations to design the unitary @xmath93 for this move , |u_move|=0 , |u_move|=0 .",
    "[ umove ]    experimentally the qubit@xmath89memory move is done @xcite by tuning the qubit in resonance ( with some overshoot ) with the memory resonator approximately for a duration @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ umove ] ) means that any reasonable shape of @xmath95 tune / detune pulse with four adjustable parameters can be used for a perfect move operation in the truncated @xmath24 system .",
    "actually , as will be discussed later , the use of only two adjustable parameters is sufficient to obtain an exponentially small error in the quasi - adiabatic regime .",
    "such two - parameter construction is most convenient for practical purposes , but formally it is imperfect ( non - zero error ) .",
    "so we will first discuss the perfect ( zero error ) four - parameter construction .",
    "we have designed the qubit@xmath89memory move pulses @xmath95 for the truncated @xmath24 device both analytically ( in first order ) and numerically .",
    "the initial and final frequencies of the qubit are allowed to be different . in the analytical design",
    "we do calculations in the bare basis , @xmath96 , but define the co - moving frame as = e^i_m t , = e^i_0^t _ q(t ) dt , = e^i_b t. in this representation the only interesting initial state @xmath97 of the qubit@xmath89memory move is ( in first order ) ( 0 ) = -g_m/_m(0 ) , ( 0 ) = 1 , ( 0 ) = g_b/_b(0 ) , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the detunings .",
    "the desired ( target ) final state at time @xmath100 is @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 notice that even though the phase @xmath103 is arbitrary , the relative phase between @xmath104 and @xmath105 is fixed by the absence of the relative phase between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we see that the move operation should eliminate the initial `` tail '' @xmath108 on the bus ( this needs two real parameters in the pulse design ) and transfer most of the excitation to the memory with correct magnitude and relative phase of @xmath105 ( two more real parameters ) .    similarly to the experimental pulse design @xcite",

    "perfect move still requires optimizing four parameters ( overshoot and duration of the middle part and the two parameters for the rear ramp ) , while using only the two parameters for the middle part is sufficient for a high - fidelity move .    in designing the moves between the qubit and the memory we assumed no quantum information on the bus .",
    "the presence of an excitation on the bus makes the previously designed perfect move imperfect .",
    "we checked numerically that the corresponding error for typical parameters is about @xmath159 , i.e.quite small .",
    "moreover , a typical rezqu algorithm never needs a move between a qubit and memory with occupied bus , so the unaccounted move errors due to truncation are even much smaller .",
    "the analysis in this paper assumes the rwa hamiltonian ( [ rwahamiltonian1 ] ) , which neglects terms @xmath163 and @xmath164 , which change the number of excitations .",
    "we have checked numerically that addition of these terms into the hamiltonian leads to negligibly small changes of the system dynamics during the move operations .",
    "designing moves between the qubit and the bus is similar to designing moves between the qubit and memory , if we consider the truncated three - element system .",
    "however , in reality the situation is more complicated because the bus is coupled with other qubits .",
    "our four - parameter argument in this case does not work , and designing a perfect single - excitation move would require @xmath165 parameters ( for a truncated system with @xmath7 qubits , one memory , and the bus ) , which is impractical .",
    "however , the occupation of additional qubits is essentially the effect of the `` tails '' ( if the discussed below problem of level crossing is avoided ) .",
    "therefore , the desired `` tails '' can be obtained automatically by using sufficiently adiabatic ramps in the same way as discussed above ( for a move qubit@xmath89bus the front ramp will be important for the `` tails '' from both sides , i.e.  on the memory and other qubits ) . in analyzing the dynamics of the `` tails '' at other qubits ,",
    "it is useful to think it terms of eigenstates of a truncated system , which includes the bus and other qubits ( while excluding the qubit involved in the move ) .",
    "then the `` tail '' error is the occupation of the eigenstates , mainly localized on other qubits .",
    "since the frequencies of the bus and other qubits do not change with time , for the error calculation it is still possible to use eq.([err - tail ] ) , in which @xmath166 is replaced with @xmath167 ( for the `` tail '' on @xmath70th qubit ) , @xmath41 is replaced with @xmath168 , and @xmath156 is replaced with @xmath169\\ , dt'$ ] , where the subscript @xmath70 labels additional qubit .",
    "this gives the estimate = | _ 0^t_1 e^-i_0^t _ q , k(t ) dt dt |^2 , [ err - tail - k]of the error due to the `` tail '' on @xmath70th qubit for the qubit@xmath89bus move , in which integration is within the front ramp , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .",
    "the formula for the bus@xmath89qubit move is similar , but the integration should be within the rear ramp . the error ( [ err - tail - k ] ) should be summed over additional @xmath172 qubits ( index @xmath70 ) and therefore can be significantly larger than in our calculations for a truncated @xmath24 system ; however , the error increase is partially compensated by smaller effective coupling @xmath173 .",
    "crudely , we expect errors below @xmath159 for smooth ramps of few - nanosecond duration and @xmath174 .",
    "we emphasize that this simple solution of the `` tail '' problem is possible only when we use eigenstates to represent the logical states .",
    "another problem which we did not encounter in the analysis of the truncated system is the level crossing with other ( empty ) qubits during the move operation .",
    "a simple estimate of the corresponding error is the following .",
    "effective resonant coupling between the moving qubit and another ( @xmath70th qubit ) via the bus is @xmath175 , where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are two qubit - bus couplings and the detuning @xmath166 is the same for both qubits at the moment of level crossing . then using the landau - zener formula we can estimate the error ( population of the other qubit after crossing ) as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the rate of the qubit frequency change at the crossing .",
    "our numerical calculations show that this estimate works well , though up to a factor of about 2 [ when curvature of @xmath95 at the point of crossing is significant ] . using this estimate for @xmath180 mhz , @xmath181 mhz , and @xmath182 mhz / ns",
    ", we obtain a quite significant error of about @xmath159 . a possible way to compensate this error is by using interference of the landau - zener transitions @xcite on the qubit return transition .",
    "another solution of the problem is to park empty qubits outside the frequency range between the bus and memories ( above 7 ghz in our example ) .",
    "this would make impossible to cancel the idling error of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegazz_4th_order ] ) by using the `` midway parking '' , but the idling error is still small even without this cancellation [ see the estimate below eq .",
    "( [ eq : ie - rezqu ] ) ] . besides the qubit - qubit level crossings",
    ", there are also level crossings between a moving qubit and other memories .",
    "this is a higher - order ( weaker ) process because of three steps between the qubit and memory .",
    "the effective coupling with @xmath70th memory is then @xmath183 , and the level crossing error estimate is latexmath:[${\\rm err } \\simeq 2\\pi g_{b}^2g_{b , k}^2g_{m , k}^2/(\\delta_b^2\\delta_{m , k}^2     in this paper we do not analyze two - qubit gates . our preliminary numerical simulation of the controlled-@xmath0 gate has shown possibility of a high - fidelity gate design ( with the error of about @xmath145 , mainly due to level crossing ) . however , we have not studied this gate in detail .",
    "a detailed analysis of two - qubit gates in the rezqu architecture will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , let us discuss whether or not using the eigenstates as the logical states presents a problem for measurement . naively , one may think about a projective measurement of an individual qubit ; in this case the logic state `` 1 '' would be erroneously measured as `` 0 '' with probability of about @xmath185 because the eigenstate spreads to the neighboring memory and bus .",
    "this would be a very significant error , and the bare - state representation of logical states would be advantageous .",
    "however , this is not actually the case because any realistic measurement is not instantaneous ( not projective ) .",
    "in fact , if a measurement takes longer than @xmath186 , then the eigenbasis is better than the bare basis .    as a particular example",
    "let us analyze tunneling measurement of a phase qubit @xcite ( we expect a similar result for the qubit measurement in the circuit - quantum - electrodynamics ( cqed ) setup @xcite ) .",
    "the bare states @xmath187 and @xmath188 of a phase qubit correspond to the two lowest energy states in a quantum well , and the measurement is performed by lowering the barrier separating the well from essentially a continuum of states @xcite .",
    "then the state @xmath188 tunnels into the continuum with a significant rate @xmath189 , while the tunneling rate for the state @xmath187 is negligible .",
    "the event of tunneling is registered by a detector `` click '' ( the detector is a squid , which senses the change of magnetic flux produced by the tunneling ) . in the ideal case after waiting for a time @xmath190 the measurement error is negligibly small ( in real experiments the ratio of the two tunneling rates is only @xmath191 , which produces a few - per - cent error ; however , we neglect this error because in principle it can be decreased by transferring the state @xmath188 population to a higher level before the tunneling , and also because here we are focusing on the effect of `` tails '' in the neighboring elements ) .    in presence of the memory and resonator coupled to the qubit ,",
    "the logic state `` 0 '' still can not be misidentified , because the tunneling is impossible without an excitation .",
    "however , the logic state `` 1 '' can be misidentified as `` 0 '' , when sometimes the expected tunneling does not happen ( because part of the excitation is located in the memory and resonator ) .",
    "let us find probability of this error . for simplicity",
    "we consider a two - component model in which a phase qubit is coupled to its memory resonator only , and restrict the state space to the single - excitation subspace of this @xmath192 system .",
    "then the tunneling process can be described by the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( e.g. , @xcite ) h =    _ m & g_mg_m & _ q - i /2    , [ tun - h]and the error in measuring the logic state `` 1 '' ( identifying it as `` 0 '' after measurement for time @xmath19 ) is its survival probability [ eq : tunnelingerror ] err = |(t)|(t)|^2 , where the initial state is normalized , @xmath193 .",
    "our goal is to compare this error for the cases when the initial state is the bare state @xmath194 or the eigenstate @xmath195 ( in this @xmath192 notation the qubit state is shown at the second place , and @xmath196 is the eigenstate before the measurement , i.e.when @xmath197 ) .",
    "the solution @xmath198 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath199 , is given by the linear combination , @xmath200 . here",
    "the eigenstate notation with the tilde sign reminds of a non - zero @xmath189 , the constants @xmath201 depend on the initial conditions , and @xmath202 are the complex eigenenergies , which include the corresponding decay rates @xmath203 and @xmath204 of the eigenstates located mainly on the memory and the qubit . diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ tun - h ] ) and assuming weak coupling , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , we find _",

    "blue curves correspond to the system initially prepared in the bare state @xmath210 , while for red curves the initial state is the eigenstate @xmath211 .",
    "for @xmath190 the measurement error ( [ eq : tunnelingerror ] ) is mainly the residual occupation @xmath212 of the memory resonator ( solid curves ) . for the depicted system parameters @xmath213 at @xmath214 ns , i.e.  the error of the eigenstate measurement is 40 times smaller than the error of the bare state measurement . ]    for measurement during a sufficiently long time @xmath215 , only the @xmath216-term in @xmath217 survives , and correspondingly the error ( [ eq : tunnelingerror ] ) is @xmath218 , where @xmath219 .",
    "thus we obtain = , err_bare= , [ err - meas]for the measurement errors starting either with the eigenstate or with the bare state . even though both errors decrease with the measurement time @xmath19 as @xmath220 ,",
    "the rate @xmath221 is small [ see eq.([gamma_mq ] ) ] , so for a realistically long measurement we can use @xmath222 .    equation ( [ err - meas ] ) shows that from the measurement point of view it is _ advantageous to use the eigenstates _ to represent the logical states rather than the bare states if @xmath223 . for a typical value @xmath224",
    "ghz this requires @xmath225 ns , which is always the case .",

    "the oscillations correspond to the beating frequency @xmath224 ghz .",
    "we see that similarly to the above - analyzed dynamics in the eigenbasis , @xmath229 becomes exponentially small after @xmath190 , while @xmath230 essentially saturates ( decaying with a much smaller rate @xmath221 ) .",

    "we emphasize that even though we have only considered the tunneling measurement , the result ( [ err - meas ] ) for the measurement error is expected to remain crudely valid for most of realistic ( i.e.``weak '' ) measurements with a time scale @xmath234 .",
    "in particular , for the cqed setup we expect that the role of @xmath189 is played ( up to a factor ) by the ensemble dephasing rate due to measurement .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the main ideas of the rezqu architecture and analyzed several error mechanisms , excluding analysis of two - qubit gates .",
    "the main advantage of the rezqu architecture is the strong ( @xmath235 times ) reduction of the idling error compared to the conventional bus - based architecture , and also an effective solution to most of the problems related to spectral crowding . in the absence of decoherence this makes possible a simple scaling of a rezqu device to @xmath236 qubits without the need for dynamical decoupling . for further scaling the next architectural level of communication between the rezqu devices",
    "seems to be needed .",
    "we have shown that instead of using bare states it is much better to use eigenstates to represent logical states . in this case",
    "there is essentially no dynamics in idling ( except for the phase errors ) , which greatly simplifies a modular construction of a quantum algorithm .",
    "the logical encoding by eigenstates is also advantageous for the single - qubit state generation and measurement .",
    "we have presented a simple design for the move operation , which is the most frequent operation in the rezqu architecture .",
    "we have shown that a four - parameter optimization is sufficient for designing a perfect move in a truncated three - component system .",
    "moreover , optimization of only two experimentally - obvious parameters is sufficient for high - fidelity moves ( with errors less than @xmath159 ) .",
    "while we have not analyzed two - qubit gates , we expect that their design with similar high fidelity is also possible .",
    "overall , we believe that the rezqu architecture offers a very significant advantage compared to the previously proposed architectures for superconducting qubits , and we believe that this is the practical way to progress towards a medium - scale quantum computing device .",
