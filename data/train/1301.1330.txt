    "the dynamo mechanism , presumably governing the cyclic evolution of the global magnetic field in the sun ( also in late type stars and galaxies as well as planets ) , depends on both , the small and large scale motions in the solar interior . within the mean - field theoretical framework ,",
    "two mechanisms are invoked to explain a dynamo cycle .",
    "these are so called @xmath0 and @xmath1 effects .",
    "the first one depends on the differential rotation ( large scale motion ) , i.e. , the amount of shear able to stretch the magnetic field lines .",
    "the second effect is the contribution of the helical turbulent motions to the amplification of magnetic field .",
    "it only exists in systems that lack reflectional symmetry ( i.e. , rotating systems ) .",
    "turbulent diffusivity is another important ingredient for a dynamo , and other small - scale phenomena like turbulent pumping ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guerrero & de gouveia dal pino , 2008 ) ) or the shear - current effect ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pipin & kosovichev , 2011 ) ) might also play a role .    from the large variety of solar dynamo solutions , the babcock - leighton ( bl )",
    "flux - transport models are particularly popular since they result in magnetic field evolution ( sunspot butterfly diagrams ) that resemble the observations .",
    "the bl mechanism is a phenomenological formulation of an @xmath1-effect that depends on the turbulent diffusion of the magnetic flux of active regions and the poleward transport of magnetic field by meridional flow . due to this meridional",
    "flow the polar magnetic flux of a previous cycle is replaced by magnetic flux of opposite polarity .",
    "the polar field is then transported downward towards the base of the convection zone where magnetic flux tubes are thought to be formed .",
    "however , the results of bl and other mean - field models are ambiguous in the sense that different combinations of parameters equally resemble the observations . making thus difficult to discern what are the correct ones .",
    "recent helioseismic results indicate that there may be two circulation cells per meridional quadrant ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the contribution of zhao et al . in this proceedings ) ) , and bl models with such meridional flow profile fail to reproduce the observations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jouve and brun , 2007 ) ) .",
    "besides , the emergence of magnetic flux tubes from the base of the convection zone to the surface is still a matter of debate ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guerrero & kpyl , 2011 ) ) .",
    "another attractive alternative , not sufficiently explored so far , to explain the solar magnetic cycle is a distributed dynamo , where the turbulent @xmath1 effect operates in the entire convection zone and not only at the boundaries as in bl models .",
    "the observed migration pattern corresponds , however , to a dynamo wave traveling equatorwards in a thin layer near the surface where the shear is negative ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brandenburg , 2005 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pipin & kosovichev , 2011 ) ) .",
    "the rotation of sunspots , faster than the surface plasma rotation , is one of the arguments in favor of this alternative .",
    "this model does not depend strongly on the meridional flow and does not require magnetic field above equipartition as the buoyancy of flux tubes model does .",
    "explaining the sunspot formation and their properties in this model is still problematic , but these phenomena are in general still an open question and deserve further study .    to advance our understanding of the solar dynamo mechanism",
    "it is important to understand first the dynamics of the flows in the convection zone . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the most realistic approach to study the solar flows is through global numerical simulations ( gns ) .",
    "although the current computing capabilities are unable to resolve the essential scales in the sun , gns are able to study systems that resemble some of the solar properties .",
    "the main expectation is to get closer to the reality and understand the complicated multi - scale physics . since the first global numerical models ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gilman , 1977 ) ) there has been huge progress in the understanding of convection in rotating spherical shells , but till now , _",
    "ab - initio _ 3d numerical models still have difficulties in reproducing the observed properties of the solar differential rotation ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* miesch et al . , 2006 ) ,",
    "* kpyl et al .",
    "2011 ) ) . to our knowledge",
    "just a few groups are addressing this problem .",
    "the ash group ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* miesch et al . , 2006 ) ) uses an anelastic , spectral code ( as well as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* busse & simitiev , 2010 ) ) , the pencil - code group ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kpyl et al . 2011 ) ) which uses finite differences to perform compressible simulations in a wedge geometry and the eulag group ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ghizaru et al . , 2010 ) ) , which so far has focused on the solar dynamo rather than on the differential rotation problem .    in this paper",
    "we present the initial results of our attempt to address the differential rotation problem with the eulag code ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smolarkiewicz et al . , 2001 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prusa et al . , 2008 ) ) .",
    "eulag is an anelastic code for geosphysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics , with unique semi - implicit numerics built on high - resolution nonoscillatory forward - in - time ( nft ) advection schemes mpdata ( for _ multidimensional positive definite advection transport algorithm _ ) ; cf .",
    "* smolarkiewicz , 2006 ) for a recent overview .",
    "the code does not require any explicit viscosity in order to remain stable , and the numerical viscosity has been identified to work similarly to the eddy viscosity used in different sub - grid scale models ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* margolin & rider , 2002 ) ) .",
    "for this reason eulag results are interpreted as iles ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smolarkiewicz & margolin , 2007 ) ) .",
    "we solve the anelastic set of hydrodynamic equations following the formulation of @xcite and @xcite : @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the total time derivative , @xmath6 , is the velocity , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pressure and potential temperature fluctuations , respectively and @xmath9 absorbs the radiative and heat diffusion terms .",

    "( [ eq : en ] ) , forces the system towards the ambient state , @xmath16 , on a timescale @xmath18 s. this timescale is much shorter than the timescale of radiative and heat diffusion , meaning that this term ultimately drives convection in the system .",
    "the fact that the sun does not exhibit important changes in its thermal state over the time scale of our interest , make us to believe that a 1d solar structural model is a good approximation for the ambient state of the solar interior .    for the simulations presented here we approximate the ambient state by a polytropic model .",
    "our domain spans in radius from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( although in the final section we extend our domain up to @xmath21 ) . from the bottom up to @xmath22 the model is stable to convection with polytropic index @xmath23 .",
    "the upper layer is convectively unstable with @xmath24 . in latitude and longitude",
    "we consider @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in the latitudinal direction discrete differentiation",
    "extends across the poles , while flipping sign of the latitudinal and meridional components of differentiated vector fields . in the radial direction we use stress free , impermeable , boundary conditions for the velocity field , whereas for @xmath8 zero normal derivative is assumed .",
    "we have performed spherical shell convection simulations aiming to reproduce the solar differential rotation . as mentioned in the previous section , our numerical model does not explicitly include dissipative terms .",
    "for this reason , it is not easy to determine precise values of non - dimensional quantities like the reynolds , rayleight or taylor numbers ( ( * ? ? ? * domaradzki et al . , 2003 ) ) . for this paper",

    "the differences between the three cases are possibly due to insufficient relaxation time , especially for the case h1",
    ". furthermore , with the increased resolution new modes of motion appear and the role of subgrid - scale transport diminishes .",
    "consequently , reproducing features of the low resolution result at higher resolution , may require incorporating explicit eddy transport or readjustment of the parameterized turbulent heat flux ( i.e. , @xmath16 and the rate of newtonian cooling ) .",

    "further investigation of solution sensitivities to explicit and implicit sgs viscosities and their interplay with means of forcing convection will be important to determine an optimal way of modeling small scale contributions to the global problem .      from the previous simulations we noticed that when convection is vigorous enough , such that its time - scale is shorter than the rotation period , the coriolis force ceases to effectively deflect the radial upflows and downflows .",
