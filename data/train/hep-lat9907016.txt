    "the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories can be surprisingly strong .",
    "low - energy theorems , the dynamics of pseudo - goldstone bosons in an expansion around the zero - momentum limit , and the whole framework of effective chiral lagrangians are examples of this . generally these constraints are imposed on the effective low - energy degrees of freedom only .",
    "it is much more surprising that both spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry due to the u(1 ) anomaly also can be used to give exact analytical predictions for the underlying _ fermion _ degrees of freedom .",
    "this is possible when one restricts the gauge theory to a large but finite four - volume @xmath0 obeying the inequality @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the pseudo - goldstone mass . in this rather extreme limit",
    "the qcd partition function depends on the fermion masses @xmath3 only in the particular combination @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the chiral condensate .",
    "while the four - volume @xmath0 must be taken to infinity in order to obtain analytical predictions , a finite - size scaling regime is thus achieved by sending fermion masses @xmath3 to zero at just such a rate that the @xmath6 s remain fixed .",
    "this is an exact finite - size scaling region in the same sense as near critical points : we can reach as accurate agreement we wish by simply choosing a sufficiently large four - volume @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to what one is accustomed to in statistical mechanics , the finite - size scaling functions are in this case known _ exactly _ , both in shape and absolute normalization , once one has the value of the infinite - volume chiral condensate @xmath5 .",
    "one of the remarkable aspects of the finite - size scaling region ( 1 ) is its relation to random matrix theory results that have proven to be universal @xcite .",
    "there is a beautiful classification of the possible chiral symmetry breaking patterns for different gauge groups and color representations of the fermions in terms of the classical random matrix theory ensembles labeled by the so - called dyson index .",
    "this leads to three major universality classes @xcite . for the quenched case ,",
    "the analytical prediction for the mass - dependent chiral condensate was in fact first obtained by verbaarschot @xcite using the exact formula for the microscopic dirac operator spectrum as derived from random matrix theory .",
    "it has later become clear that these results can also be derived from finite - volume partition functions alone @xcite .",
    "a powerful analytical technique uses fully or partially quenched ( supersymmetric ) chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "lattice gauge simulations have already shown nice agreement with the exact analytical predictions for the microscopic dirac operator spectrum associated with all three different universality classes @xcite using staggered fermions .",
    "it has been particularly challenging to see also the detailed analytical predictions in gauge field sectors of fixed non - zero topological charge @xmath7 , and this has very recently been achieved using perfect actions @xcite and overlap fermions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic series of lattice gauge theory tests of the exact predictions related to the mass - dependent chiral condensates and one of the chiral susceptibilities . for the case of gauge group su(3 ) and staggered fermions in the fundamental representation such an analysis was first performed @xcite on the basis of lattice gauge theory data from the columbia group @xcite .",
    "these data , based on configurations with @xmath8 dynamical fermions , were taken for finite - temperature lattice volumes , and with rather large correlation lengths . because the dynamical fermion masses were large on that scale , and the physical pions therefore not obeying the inequality ( 1 ) , the configurations were in fact to be considered as completely quenched on the scale of the mass of the valence fermions .",
    "as there are very accurate estimates for the infinite - volume chiral condensate @xmath5 for the same theory at different @xmath9-values @xcite , we now have parameter - free predictions at these @xmath9-values .",
    "furthermore , we can probe much larger physical volumes ( and hence obtain higher accuracy ) , and our result will not be contaminated by finite - temperature effects .",
    "this case corresponds to the chiral _ unitary _ ( chue ) random matrix theory ensemble .",
    "we next turn to gauge group su(2 ) and staggered fermions in the fundamental and adjoint representations .",
    "the former case corresponds at our finite lattice spacings to the chiral _",
    "ensemble ( chse ) in the random matrix theory classification , while the latter corresponds to the chiral _ orthogonal _ ensemble ( choe ) . in this way",
    "we cover all three major universality classes . however , staggered fermions suffer from two significant defects in this context .",
    "first , at our finite lattice spacings the staggered fermions with su(2 ) gauge group do not fall into the right universality classes as compared with fermions in the continuum @xcite .",
    "second , artifacts due to finite lattice spacings prevent us from testing more than the gauge field sector of topological charge @xmath10 with these fermions . both of these shortcomings can be overcome by the use of more sophisticated fermion formulations .",
    "we shall here provide lattice data obtained with overlap fermions @xcite . here",
    "finite lattice - spacing analogs of continuum relations for the chiral condensate in non - trivial topological backgrounds can be established @xcite .",
    "we thus simultaneously achieve both the correct identification with respect to continuum universality classes , and correct relationships in non - trivial topological gauge field sectors .",
    "we shall throughout restrict ourselves to the quenched limit , @xmath11 .",
    "analytically this limit is readily taken , both from random matrix theory and from the ( quenched ) finite - volume partition functions , and the answers have been shown to agree .",
    "there are thus precise and unequivocal analytical predictions also for this case .    for which observables",
    "do we have exact analytical predictions ?",
    "essentially all quantities for which the partition function itself @xmath12 , perhaps extended with additional fermion species , is a generating function .",
    "the simplest quantity to focus on is obviously the mass - dependent chiral condensate itself , which in the quenched theory simply reads @xmath13 ~.\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the genuine chiral condensate in the massless limit of the infinite - volume theory , and @xmath14 is the microscopically rescaled quenched `` valence '' fermion mass @xmath15 . because of the relation ( at fixed topological charge @xmath7 ) @xmath16 the mass - dependent chiral condensate tests a massive spectral sum rule for the microscopic density @xmath17 of the dirac operator spectrum @xcite",
    ". non - negative .",
    "] we shall here restrict ourselves to the quenched cases , where @xmath18 is mass - independent ( and the partially quenched cases are completely analogous ) .",
    "this is one way in which the analytical prediction for the quenched limit can be obtained ( the other proceeds directly from the quenched chiral lagrangian @xcite ) . in numerical simulations",
    "the condensate measurements are of course performed very easily ( from the trace of the propagator ) , without ever having to compute the dirac operator spectrum itself .",
    "nevertheless , we have sometimes found it convenient to supplement direct measurements by appropriate sums over eigenvalues . in this connection",
    "it is important to stress the following point . because of eq .",
    "( [ chirho ] ) , we are in fact concerned with tests of the analytical predictions for @xmath19 .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath20 to test these predictions is that it in a quantitative manner probes the microscopic spectral density in different regimes .",
    "for instance , by going to very small values of @xmath21 the condensate becomes very sensitive to the precise eigenvalue distribution around @xmath22 .",
    "in particular for the chue ( in the @xmath10 sector ) and the choe ( in the @xmath10 and @xmath23 sectors ) @xmath20 , as we shall see below , is extremely sensitive to the low-@xmath24 distribution of the smallest non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "this effect can be enhanced by considering in addition an observable such as a chiral susceptibility , as we shall discuss below .",
    "considering the expression ( [ chirho ] ) for the chiral condensate , one might wonder about the necessity of subtractions .",
    "after all , even in free field theory the spectral density of the dirac operator goes like @xmath25 , and the spectral representation of the condensate is thus ultraviolet divergent .",
    "there are no such divergences in the finite - volume scaling regime considered here , and we should make no subtractions in the chiral condensate either .",
    "although this point was already explained in the paper of leutwyler and smilga @xcite , it is worthwhile to repeat it here .",
    "the explanation is as follows : what we are computing here is not the conventionally defined chiral condensate .",
    "we are taking a correlated limit of @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is kept fixed . in this limit",
    "the condensate @xmath29 receives contributions only from dirac operator eigenvalues on the scale of @xmath30 , and below .",
    "the ultraviolet end of the dirac operator spectrum is not ignored : the corrections ( and hence subtractions ) from this region are of the kind @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the ultraviolet cutoff . in the scaling region",
    "where @xmath34 is kept fixed , these terms are suppressed by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the ultraviolet end of the dirac operator spectrum in this region enters only as @xmath35 corrections to the main predictions .",
    "in addition , there are of course also @xmath35 corrections from the neglect of non - static modes in the effective partition function , so all of these @xmath35 corrections are effectively beyond our control .",
    "consistent with this observation is the fact that @xmath35 corrections are non - universal in the random matrix theory context @xcite . here",
    "we are interested only in the leading , universal , predictions for @xmath26 .",
    "corresponding to the three different universality classes , there are three distinct predictions for the mass - dependent condensate",
    ". we shall here give the predictions for gauge field sectors of fixed topological index @xmath7 , and for any number of massless flavors @xmath37 .",

    "this is the universality class of the chue in the random matrix theory classification .",

    "the proportionality factor , @xmath146 , depends in particular on the mass in the wilson - dirac operator used  @xcite .",

    "the infinite - volume chiral condensate @xmath5 differs significantly , at the same @xmath9-values , from that of staggered fermions .",

    "[ fig : ov_rhos]c",
    ". however , the data rapidly deviates up from the curve for higher eigenvalues .",
    "this is a finite - volume effect since as the volume increases the scale of the eigenvalues decreases into the region where rmt applies .",
    "the infinite volume chiral condensate @xmath5 sets the scale for the eigenvalues , and since the condensate is larger for staggered fermions compared to overlap fermions at corresponding parameters , the eigenvalues for staggered fermions occur closer to zero where there is a corresponding better agreement for more oscillations with the rmt predictions .    nevertheless , we can expect to find the best agreement of @xmath149 with the rmt predictions where the fermion mass is probing the scale of eigenvalues in @xmath61 that are in best agreement .",
    "for the chiral condensate @xmath150 the agreement with rmt will depend on the overall @xmath61 which we remarked is best for the symplectic case . since the spectral density does not match the rmt prediction for many oscillations in the unitary case as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ov_rhos]a , we expect higher topologies to not be well described by rmt .",
    "in addition , we can expect problems for comparisons of observables for small fermions masses when the @xmath151 has not been adequately sampled , and this problem is most pronounced in the orthogonal case . compared to the staggered fermion example in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmin_orth_st ] , we do not have enough statistics and large enough volumes to adequately sample the leading edge of the eigenvalue distributions shown in detail in fig .",

    "we stress that for the sectors of non - vanishing @xmath7 we have subtracted the somewhat trivial @xmath91 term , which otherwise would completely dominate the plot .",
    "what is shown is thus not the chiral condensate per se , but rather @xmath154 .",
    "the agreement in the @xmath10 sector is good , but while the data for the @xmath23 , 2 , and 3 qualitatively display the right behavior , they are nevertheless somewhat off the analytical predictions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ov_om]a we show the subtracted @xmath155 for the unitary case . as mentioned before , this observable is a more sensitive probe of the eigenvalue distribution at a fixed fermion mass and should yield better agreement when the corresponding @xmath61 is in good agreement with the rmt predictions .",
    "we see good agreement for @xmath156 in all topology sectors , but below this value there are deviations related to the lack of small eigenvalues in @xmath157 and the small volume . for the orthogonal ensemble",
    "we find even worse agreement for @xmath158 ) in @xmath155 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ov_om]b where we simultaneously have an adequately sampled distribution of very small eigenvalues and good agreement of @xmath151 with rmt .",
    "we next turn to gauge group su(2 ) and overlap fermions in the adjoint representation where we find the expected good agreement with analytical predictions for the @xmath10 and @xmath102 sectors ( we found almost no configurations in the sectors of higher topological charge in this case ) . these graphs are shown in fig .  [ fig : ov_pbp]c and fig .",

    "we have performed a systematic series of monte carlo tests of the analytical predictions for the chiral condensate and related chiral susceptibilities in the finite - volume scaling region of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in four dimensions",
    "there are three universality classes with which to compare , conveniently classified in random matrix theory terminology by means of chiral versions of the three classical matrix ensembles , @xmath159 , chse , chue and choe .",
    "once the infinite - volume chiral condensate @xmath5 is known , there are parameter - free finite - volume scaling functions with which to compare data .",
    "as we have shown , results for all three universality classes with topological charge @xmath10 are nicely reproduced by staggered fermions . to test the analytical predictions for gauge field sectors of non - trivial topological winding numbers ,",
    "we have also considered overlap fermions , which possess exact zero modes in topologically non - trivial gauge fields .",
    "here there is qualitatively good agreement , with even excellent agreement in the case of the chse universality class .",
    "the deviations from the rmt predictions observed in the other cases are understood to be due to either finite volume effects or the relatively modest statistics we were able to obtain in the simulations with overlap fermions .",
    "the results presented here clearly show the power of the finite - size analysis that has come out of the study of finite - volume effective partition functions and random matrix theory .",
    "in contrast to conventional finite - size scaling analysis near critical points , we are here in the unusual situation of knowing not only the right scaling variables , but also parameter - free exact analytical predictions for the scaling quantities . in this particular corner of those non - abelian or abelian gauge theories that support spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry the exact analytical predictions",
