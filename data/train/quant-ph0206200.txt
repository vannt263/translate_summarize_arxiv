    "the quantum eraser @xcite has been approved as a remarkable tool for studying fundamental topics in quantum mechanics . among them",
    "we mention complementarity @xcite , the understanding of measurements in quantum mechanics , and , most importantly , the entanglement between subsystems which enables the very concept of quantum erasure @xcite .",
    "there have been several experimental realizations of the quantum eraser demonstrating complementarity as one of the most basic principles of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "further , quantitative measures of complementarity have been derived on the basis of an inequality for ( partial ) predictability @xmath0 of the path the particle takes and ( partial ) visibility @xmath1 of the interference fringes in a two - way interferometer @xcite and experimentally verified @xcite . somewhat later , englert @xcite as well as jaeger , shimony , and vaidman @xcite derived an inequality which quantifies complementarity in a two - way interferometer supplemented by a which - way detector .",
    "they introduce the new quantity _ distinguishability _ @xmath2 which quantifies the maximum possible information , obtainable by the which - way detectors , that nature can grant us about the path the particle actually takes .",
    "the inequality has also been verified in several subsequent experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that the which - path knowledge @xmath3 which is the practically available which - way information granted by the which - way detectors may be considerably less than the distinguishability @xmath4 in realistic which - path measurements @xcite .",
    "the inequalities have been extended in order to incorporate quantum erasure by introducing the quantum eraser visibility , @xmath5 @xcite , or the equivalent conditioned visibility , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the results can be summarized by the erasure relation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coherence which denotes the maximum possible quantum eraser visibility , @xmath9 , nature can grant us about the visibility of the interference fringes .",
    "taking into account that the smallest value of the actual which - path information , @xmath3 , is given by the a priori knowledge , @xmath10 , the following inequality inequality has been derived @xcite , @xmath11 which states that the quantum eraser visibility @xmath5 can not exceed the maximum value @xmath12 , since @xmath13 .",
    "thus , a conventional quantum eraser can not erase the a priori predictability @xmath10 which fundamentally limits the performance of quantum erasure .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate erasure of the a priori predictability with a _",
    "conditional _ quantum eraser .",
    "the retrieved visibility explicitly exceeds the maximum possible value derived for conventional quantum erasers [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) ] .",
    "the conditional quantum eraser not only does sort subensembles as conventional quantum erasers do but , beyond it , also selects a proper subensemble .",
    "this can be achieved by employing interaction - free _ partial _ measurements , as has been suggested in the paper by elitzur and dolev @xcite who consider nonlocal effects of partial measurements and quantum erasure .",
    "we extend their results to erasure of a priori knowledge and derive the underlying physical concept which enables predictability to be erased and which turns out to be _ concurrence _ or _ two - particle visibility_. the concept of concurrence and especially two - particle visibility yields an interesting relation between entanglement and complementarity .",
    "further , the quality of the recovered interference fringes will strongly depend on the amount of concurrence in the initial system .",
    "the partial interaction - free measurement composes a non - unitary transformation which , evidently , has a certain probability of failure .",

    "recently , this remarkable young - type double - slit experiment succeeded in the observation of polarization - dependent interference effects @xcite and stimulated ongoing research @xcite .",
    "we model the partial interaction - free measurement with the help of inefficient detectors which can be simulated by perfect detectors together with beamsplitters .",
    "a detector click indicates a failure of the conditional quantum eraser while the absence of a click means that the quantum erasure ( of predictability ) has succeeded .",
    "the success rate will be limited by the degree of predictability .",
    "the quantum eraser visibility will further depend on the amount of concurrence in the initial system which limits the quality of the retrieved interference fringes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec.2 ]",
    "we present the interferometric system and consider the general idea of conditional quantum erasing .",
    "we also discuss differences between the conditional quantum eraser and conventional quantum erasers .",
    "inequalities are derived and compared for the conditional and conventional quantum eraser .",
    "we restrict our considerations to pure states of the entangled system in this section . in section [ sec.3 ]",
    "we apply the general idea of conditional quantum erasing to the four - level atom interferometer and discuss various realizations of conditional quantum erasure in this system .",
    "we derive the success probability of erasure and discuss its relation to the concurrence in the initial ( unsorted ) system .",
    "we extend our results to cases when the initial system is not in a pure ( entangled ) state in section [ sec.4 ] and show the limitation on the performance of conditional quantum erasure due to the mixture . in particular , it will turn out that we can not reach the maximum visibility anymore .",
    "finally , in section [ sec.5 ] , we present some concluding remarks and discussions .",
    "we first discuss and summarize the general idea of the conditional quantum eraser on the basis of a simple model in an attempt to prepare the reader for the arguments which follow .",
    "suppose we are given two spatially separated two - photon sources , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see fig .",

    "we stress already here that the entanglement between the photons is an essential ingredient for the nonclassical features of the conditional quantum eraser .",
    "the coupled system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) contains @xmath20-polarized photons , forming the `` interfering system '' , which are detected at an interference screen , and the @xmath16-polarized photons which establish the `` environmental degrees of freedom '' and whose detection may serve as , e.g.a which - path measurement . in the `` environment '' only those degrees of freedom are included which can be controlled by the experimentalist by , e.g. , which - path measurements or quantum eraser sorting .",
    ", in the upper right arm of the interferometer generates ( partial ) predictability about the path the interfering @xmath20-photon takes .",
    "the measurement device in the lower left arm , consisting of a beamsplitter with transmittance @xmath26 and a photon detector , performs a partial , interaction - free which - path measurement on the erasing @xmath16-photon .",
    "if the detector clicks , the conditional quantum eraser failed .",
    "if the detector does not respond , the conditional quantum eraser succeeded . in this case",
    "the correlated measurement of the erasing photon at an equidistantly positioned detector in between the two atoms and the interfering photon will result in a complete erasing of the predictability under certain circumstances .",

    "suppose , we only consider the right part of the interference configuration in fig .",
    "2 ] which establishes a standard young - type interference experiment with two atoms acting as the double - slit .",
    "first , we assume just one @xmath20-polarized photon emitted by the two atoms and not the entangled photon system of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , one of the two paths ( the upper one in fig .  [ fig .",
    "2 ] ) is partially blocked by an optical filter .",
    "the intensity of the light or , to be more precise , the probability amplitude of the photon will be reduced , compared to the other optical path ( the lower one in fig .",
    "2 ] ) , as @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the transmittance of the optical filter .",
    "the reduction obviously depends on the transmittance @xmath28 . consequently , partial , _ a priori _ knowledge about the path the photon actually takes is granted and this is expressed by the _ predictability _",
    "@xmath10 @xcite @xmath29 we expect the visibility @xmath30 to be reduced as a consequence of this a priori knowledge in agreement with the general duality relation @xmath31 leading to the following maximum possible visibility in this interferometer @xmath32    let us now consider the complete interferometer including the environmental , @xmath16-polarized photon but neglecting the partial measurement device in the lower left path . the entanglement between the photons in eq .",

    "this explains why we do not observe interference when we neglect the environment , i.e.  do not detect or measure the @xmath16-photon .",
    "the actual knowledge , @xmath3 , which is the amount of which - path information that we can learn from the measurement of the environment , is usually smaller than the distinguishability , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in particular , when we do not measure the @xmath16-photon , the actual which - way information @xmath3 is just given by the a priori knowledge or predictability @xmath10 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.3 ] ) , since we do not gain further information if we discount the environment . in general",
    ", the actual which - path information is limited by the following inequality @xcite @xmath36    one of the reasons , why we start with the entangled state , ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , is that quantum eraser sorting in the usual sense is immediately possible .",
    "this can be done , if we detect the environmental @xmath16-photon with a detector equidistantly placed from the two atoms as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] . a correlated detection of the @xmath20- and @xmath16-photons erases the distinguishability and we retrieve interference .",

    "( [ eq2.8a ] ) ] @xcite , and @xmath39 here @xmath30 denotes the `` a priori visibility '' of the system before quantum erasing @xcite .",
    "we note at this point , that the quantity @xmath8 was also called the coherence in ref . @xcite .",
    "although a possible relation of this quantity to an entanglement measure was mentioned , it was not associated with the _ concurrence _ introduced by wootters @xcite . here",
    ", we close this gap by stating that the `` coherence '' is indeed a measure of entanglement which is explicitly given by the concurrence of the initial system .",
    "we also mention that the concurrence is directly connected with the two - particle visibility introduced by jaeger _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) which gives the concurrence an evident physical meaning .",
    "englert and bergou demonstrated the following _ erasure relation _",
    "@xcite , on the basis of the inequalities ( [ eq2.7 ] ) and ( [ eq2.9 ] ) , @xmath40 thus , the maximum possible visibility of the recovered interference fringes , @xmath41 , can never reach unity if the predictability , @xmath10 , is not equal to zero , @xmath42 in other words , a conventional quantum eraser can never erase the _ a priori _ predictability @xmath10 .",
    "when we consult eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.8 ] ) it is easy to see that the considered interferometric scheme satisfies the general inequalities , ( [ eq2.10 ] ) and ( [ eq2.11 ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the state under consideration is a pure state , the inequalities transform into equalities @xcite .",
    "we have just showed that a conventional quantum eraser can not erase the a priori knowledge or predictability , @xmath10 .",
    "does this mean that it is impossible to erase predictability ?",
    "we anticipate the answer by claiming that it is indeed possible to erase predictability .",
    "however , this can only be achieved with a certain success probability which is subject to some constraints .",
    "we , therefore , call such an eraser a _ conditional quantum eraser_. in the following , our task will be to find a device which erases the a priori knowledge .",
    "a naive approach starts , again , by considering the right part of the interferometric device in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] .",
    "we assume just a single @xmath20-polarized photon which arises from the sources @xmath23 and @xmath24 and do not consider a biphoton at first .",
    "this approach will also help us to understand the crucial quantum features of the conditional _ quantum _ eraser .",
    "suppose we utilize a second optical filter with the same transmittance , @xmath28 , as the upper optical filter in the lower optical path of the right part of the interferometric device in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] .",
    "accordingly , the initial state of the photon , ( [ eq2.2 ] ) , is transferred to @xmath43 thus , we recover perfect visibility of the interference fringes and apparently erase the a priori knowledge . however , at the same time we change the a priori conditions of the interferometric setup .",
    "the second optical filter alters the interference device to an ideal two - way interferometer with no a priori knowledge about the path the photon takes .",
    "we have gained perfect fringe visibility by changing the interferometric device for the interfering @xmath20-photon .",
    "in other words , we alter the a priori condition of the right part of the interferometer which defines the initial interferometric properties of the @xmath20-photon .",
    "this , however , does not constitute the basis what we want to consider as an erasing of the a priori knowledge .",
    "in particular , we do not want to change the right part of the interferometric setup which alters the a priori conditions of the interfering @xmath20-photon and consequently changes the a priori knowledge about the path the photon takes .",
    "the concept to erase predictability without directly or locally affecting the interfering photon , in the sense of changing the a priori conditions of the right interferometer in fig .",
    "2 ] , is realized by the quantum property _",
    "entanglement_. thus , we have to consider a biphoton as , e.g.  that of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) , for the arguments which follow .",
    "as already mentioned , entanglement between the photons is essential in order to meet the requirements for the conditional quantum eraser .",
    "again , a naive approach starts with changing the a priori properties of the complete four - port interferometer in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] .",
    "that is , we insert an optical filter in the lower left arm of the interferometer with the same transmittance @xmath28 as the one in the upper right arm .",
    "although classically this will not have any effect on the interfering @xmath20-photon , quantum mechanically , due to the entanglement in the biphoton state ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , the biphoton is transformed into the following state @xmath44 consequently , we recover full interference fringes in a coincidence measurement of the two photons , i.e.  under the quantum eraser conditions .",
    "however , the initial properties of the four - port interferometer have changed albeit under an intriguing , _ nonlocal _ and certainly nonclassical manner .",
    "the predictability of the path of the _ biphoton _ has become zero in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.15 ] ) due to an optical intervention .",
    "this is still not completely the situation which we want to consider as a conditional quantum eraser .",
    "we try to realize the conditional quantum eraser without changing the initial optical properties of the four - port interferometer .",
    "this can be achieved with the help of a nonlocal , partial and interaction - free which - way measurement of the path the photon takes @xcite . as in the previous discussion",
    ", we assume a black box , representing the measurement device , instead of the optical filter in the lower left arm of the four - port interferometer . the measurement device will not locally interact with the interfering photon but only affects the  erasing photon  .",
    "thus , in the same manner as above , the entanglement between the interfering and the erasing photon plays an essential role in the manipulation of the optical properties of the interfering photon by the erasing photon .",
    "we will , at this point , not discuss details about the black box or measurement device but only argue about its general features .",
    "we assume a measurement device that can partly determine the path of the erasing photon ( @xmath16-photon ) in the four - port interferometer .",
    "in addition , the measurement apparatus can report a positive or a negative result .",
    "that is , the measurement apparatus can unambiguously tell if it succeeded in partially distinguishing between the paths the @xmath16-photon took ( positive result ) or not ( negative result ) .",
    "further , the probability of failure is adjustable to the value predetermined by the predictability of the path of the interfering @xmath20-photon , @xmath45 .",
    "if we denote the states of the measurement device with @xmath46 , related with a positive result or success , and @xmath47 , connected with a negative result or failure , the state of the biphoton including the states of the measurement apparatus unitarily transforms into @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq2.16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this constitutes the initial state of the conditional quantum eraser .",
    "suppose the measurement apparatus gives a positive result . under this condition",
    "the state of the biphoton is transformed in such a way that we recover perfect fringe visibility for the @xmath20-photon under quantum erasing conditions , i.e.  in a coincidence measurement of the biphoton .",
    "the partial , interaction - free which - way measurement of the @xmath16-photon manipulates the entangled @xmath20-photon in such a manner that full interference fringes are recovered in a quantum eraser scheme .",
    "the partial interaction - free measurement becomes evident if we consider the effect of the measurement on the @xmath16-photon itself .",
    "clearly , the initial state of the @xmath16-photon , @xmath49 is transformed into @xmath50 under the influence of the partial , interaction - free measurement .",
    "if , on the other hand , the measurement apparatus responds ( negative result ) we will discard the biphoton .",
    "in other words , we have erased the predictability or the a priori knowledge of the path the @xmath20-photon takes with the help of an interaction - free , partial which - way measurement of the @xmath16-photon .",
    "however , this can only be achieved under the condition that the measurement apparatus does not react .",
    "the probability that this takes place is connected with the initial predictability of the @xmath20-photon path .",
    "in particular the failure probability of our conditional quantum eraser is directly given by the predictability , @xmath10 .",
    "the realization of the measurement apparatus or the black box will be the subject of the next section .",
    "we will also make clear why we can talk about an interaction - free measurement .",
    "we start with the consideration of the two - atom , four - port interferometer in fig .  [ fig . 2 ] .",
    "suppose the initial atomic state is given as @xmath51 applying a @xmath16-polarized laser pulse with weak enough intensity that only one atom at any given time will be excited , the atoms transform into latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle_{\\text{atom}}\\to |1\\rangle_{a}\\otimes|3\\rangle_{b}+    the detector on the right in our four - port interference scheme is only sensitive to @xmath20-polarized photons , i.e.  we ignore @xmath16-polarized photons .",
    "in this case the system evolves into the following state @xmath53 after decay of the atoms .",
    "next , we apply a second , @xmath54 circularly polarized laser pulse , again weak enough that only one atom at a time will be excited .",
    "this transforms the atomic state into latexmath:[$|\\psi\\rangle_{\\text{atom}}=|1\\rangle_{a}\\otimes|3\\rangle_{b}+    left part of our four - port interferometer only to be sensitive to @xmath16-polarized photons .",
    "that is , we ignore @xmath20-polarized photons in the second transition . under this condition , after the decay of the atoms , the system will evolve into the following state @xmath56 we ignored the time - dependence of the photon arrivals as well as the time - dependence of the application of the laser pulses throughout the above derivation for simplicity reasons .",
    "further , the time - dependence of the photon arrivals is not important for the considerations which follow .",
    "we notice , that the two - atom interferometer can generate an entangled state between the photons identical to the entangled photon state in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) . from now on , we neglect the atomic subspace in ( [ eq3.4 ] ) which will not change after generation of the biphoton state and reaches the initially assumed atomic state after each generation of biphotons , ready for another generation cycle .",
    "let us first neglect the measurement device in the lower left arm of the four - port interferometer in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] . the optical filter in the upper right arm of the interferometer generates a priori knowledge of the @xmath20-polarized photon in dependence of its transmittance @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath20-photon state by itself will be transformed into @xmath57 which clearly shows that the partial predictability of the path the photon takes is given by @xmath58 . translating this to the biphoton state ( [ eq3.4 ] ) and ignoring the atomic subspace we arrive at the expression , @xmath59 in other words , in a coincidence measurement of the biphoton with the detector of",
    "the @xmath16-photon equidistantly placed from the two atoms we realize the _ conventional _ quantum eraser condition @xcite . the ability to recover interference fringes",
    "is limited by the a priori knowledge about the path the @xmath20-photon takes .    in order to implement the _ conditional",
    "_ quantum eraser we have to insert the measurement device .",
    "in particular , we want to realize a partial , interaction - free which - way measurement of the @xmath16-photon . a possible device capable in doing this is already implied in the lower left arm of the four - port interferometer , in fig .  [ fig . 2 ] .",
    "it consists of a beamsplitter which splits the path of the @xmath60-photon into two alternatives .",
    "we place a detector , which operates with 100@xmath61 efficiency , in one of the two alternatives .",
    "suppose the ratio between transmission and reflection of the beamsplitter can be adjusted to a preset value . in particular , we can set the transmittance of the beamsplitter , @xmath26 , equal to the transmittance of the optical filter , @xmath62 , in the upper right arm of the interferometer .",
    "let us consider how this affects the @xmath16-photon , i.e.  we ignore for a moment the @xmath20-photon and consider the @xmath16-photon alone .",
    "due to the unitary transformation of the beamsplitter , the @xmath16-photon transforms into the following state @xmath63 here we took into account the detector states @xmath46 , indicating success , and @xmath47 for failure ( the detector clicks ) , as well as the two alternatives @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the @xmath60-photon amplitude .",
    "the alternative @xmath64 , of course , is the original mode or the original  path  the @xmath16-photon takes .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq3.6 ] ) that the beamsplitter together with the detector performs a partial and interaction - free which - way measurement of the path the @xmath16-photon takes in the interferometer .",

    "on the other hand , the partial measurement fails if the detector reacts , i.e.  a photon is detected , indicated by the detector state @xmath47 . in other words , a partial , interaction - free measurement of the @xmath16-photon takes place under the condition that the detector does not click .",
    "consequently , we are allowed to speak about a _ conditional _ , interaction - free and partial which - way measurement .",

    "thus , the `` no - click '' event in the measurement device indicates a `` click '' event on the eraser detector .",
    "this fact is important in practice if inefficient detectors are involved . in case of ideal conditions , we detect all involved photons and the `` no - click '' event on the measurement device is equivalent with a `` click '' event on the eraser detector",
    "however , this can only be achieved when , first , the transmittance of the beamsplitter is equal to the transmittance of the optical filter , @xmath62 , and , second , under the condition that the photon detector of the measurement apparatus does not respond , i.e.  the measurement device works interaction free and resides in the state @xmath46 . in other words",

    "moreover , the product of success probability and two - particle visibility or concurrence of the obtained quantum state , ( [ eq3.7 ] ) , is limited by the degree of concurrence or two - particle visibility of the initial state , ( [ eq2.8a ] ) ( see also discussion following eq .",

    "in particular , the conditional quantum eraser visibility can explicitly top the concurrence or two - particle visibility of the _ initial _ system which is impossible with a conventional quantum eraser [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) ] .    the complementarity relation ( [ eq2.10 ] ) represents the main feature of the conditional quantum eraser .",
    "it contains all the important facets of the physical peculiarities .",
    "first , we get a direct relation between entanglement and complementarity . in particular , the concurrence is a well known entanglement measure @xcite and it is , in the case of the four - port two - atom interferometer , given by the measurable quantity of two - particle visibility @xcite .",
    "a similar expression for real particles has also been found in @xcite , but only with the equal sign .",
    "in addition , the expression there contains distinguishability and not predictability , which arises because of the entanglement of the biparticle to an additional subsystem . in eq .",
