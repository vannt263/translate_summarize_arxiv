    "galaxy formation involves a large set of physical processes - cosmological expansion , gravity , hydrodynamics , atomic physics and feedback from star formation , stellar evolution and black hole growth - and spans large dynamic ranges in time ( at least @xmath7myr to @xmath8gyr ) and space ( at least @xmath9pc to @xmath10mpc ) . some of the most interesting results on galaxy formation",
    "are thus obtained using large - scale simulations , providing fundamental insights on a variety of different aspects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the spatial distributions of galaxies have been extensively studied observationally , primarily at low redshift . among the most striking",
    "is the nature s ability to maintain a powerlaw galaxy - galay two - point correlation function over a significant range ( @xmath11mpc ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there is evidence of a slight inflection at @xmath12mpc in recent analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this spatial regularity is not inherited from the linear power spectrum but must be a result of cooperation between nonlinear evolution and galaxy formation . in self - gravitating systems , such as galaxies , the temporal and spatial structures may be related .",
    "this may be seen by two examples .",
    "first , for an isolated ( non - dissipative ) spherical system , the collapse time of each shell ( assuming no shell crossings ) is uniquely determined by the interior mass and specific energy of the shell that in turn is determined by the density structures .",
    "second , during the growth of a typical galaxy , in addition to direct acquisition of stars via mergers and accretion ( along with dark matter ) , significant spatial interactions may induce significant star formation activities hence leave temporal imprints in its star formation history .",
    "taking these indications together suggests that one should benefit by tackling the problem of galaxy formation combining the spatial and temporal information . here , as a step in that direction",
    ", we perform a novel analysis , utilizing the ab initio laozi adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamic simulation , to understand the statistical properties of star formation episodes in galaxies .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for detailed descriptions of our simulations and the list of its empirical validations therein .",
    "briefly , a zoom - in region of comoving size of @xmath13mpc@xmath14 is embedded in a @xmath15mpc periodic box and resolved to better than @xmath16pc ( physical ) .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite @xmath17cdm model : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "equations governing motions of dark matter , gas and stars , and thermodynamic state of gas are followed forward in time from redshift @xmath10 to @xmath24 , using the adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamic code enzo @xcite , which includes all important microphysics and major feedback processes that are well measured .",
    "stellar particles ( equivalent to coeval stellar cluster of mass @xmath25 ) are created from gas clouds meeting certain physical conditions over time , based on the empirical kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "stellar particles at any time may be grouped together spatially using the hop algorithm @xcite to create galaxy catalogs , which are tested to be robust and insensitive to specific choices of concerned parameters within reasonable ranges . for each galaxy",
    "we have its exact star formation history , given its member stellar particles formation times . a total of ( 2090 , 965 , 296 , 94 , 32 , 10 ) galaxies are found with stellar masses greater than ( @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "for each galaxy we create an uniform time grid of star formation rate at a time resolution of @xmath28myr from redshift @xmath29 to @xmath24 , which we call the  unsmoothed \" sf history , denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "we then smooth @xmath30 using a square window of full width equal to @xmath31 to create a locally - averaged version , denoted as @xmath32 , which is defined to be @xmath33 .",
    "another variable is then defined from @xmath32 : @xmath34 .",
    "we smooth @xmath35 with a gaussian window of radius @xmath36 to yield @xmath37 .",
    "we obtain finally @xmath38 .",
    "we identify sf peaks in @xmath39 as follows .",
    "each sf peak is defined as a contiguous region between two consecutive local minima in @xmath39 , say , at time @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we sum up @xmath30 in the same temporal region [ @xmath40 , @xmath41 ] to get the total stellar mass for the peak . for each galaxy ,",
    "we catalog and rank order a complete list of peaks each containing the following information : the total stellar mass , the point in time of maximum sfr and the rank .",
    "the number of top sf peaks that make up 50% and 90% of total amount of stellar mass of a galaxy at @xmath27 is denoted , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "we note that the main purpose of smoothing @xmath35 with the gaussian window is to make the automated peak identification method umambiguous .",
    "thus , it is @xmath45 that serves as a time  ruler \" .",
    "we use @xmath46 and find the slope of the scaling relation found does not depend on @xmath47 within the concerned accuracies .",
    "-0.3 cm -1.0 cm",
    "-0.5 cm -1.0 cm    we start by showing the star formation histories for four galaxies in figure  [ fig : sfr ] . we see that our adaptive smoothing scheme appropriately retains major sf peaks but smooths out high - frequency peaks on scales smaller than the ruler size @xmath45 , exactly serving the purpose .",
    "we also see that there are temporal structures from @xmath48myr to @xmath48gyr .",
    "although it is difficult to quantify visually the nature of the temporal structures , there is a hint that a significant sf peak is often sandwiched by periods of diminished sf activities or less significant sf peaks .",
    "it is evident that the histories of individual galaxies vary substantially with respect to both the trend on long time scales and fluctuations on short time scales .",
    "anectodal evidence that is consistent with the global evolution of sfr density @xcite is that , for the galaxy population as a whole , the majority of galaxies are on a downward trend of sfr with increasing time ( decreasing redshift ) from @xmath49gyr ( corresponding to @xmath50 to @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is seen that sf in galaxies is usually not monolithic .",
    "a typical galaxy is found to have a polylithic temporal structure of star formation , consisting of a series of quasi - monoliths occurring in time in an apparently chaotic fashion .",
    "not only is there no evidence that a typical galaxy forms most of its stars in a single burst , but also the sf history over any scale does not display a form that may be represented by any simple analytic functions ( such as an exponential ) .",
    "a qualitatively similar appearance of oscillatory star formation rates are seen in @xcite , although detailed quantitative comparisons are not available at this time .",
    "one take - away message is this : galaxy formation is a chaotic process and conclusions about the galaxy population as a whole based on an unrepresentative sample of galaxies should be taken cautiously .",
    "another is that the often adopted simple temporal profiles for star formation ( such as exponential decay or delta function ) in interpreting observational results should be reconsidered .",
    "we now turn to quantitative results .",
    "figure  [ fig : perc50 ] shows the pdfs of @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath51myr .",
    "we see that the number of peaking containing 50% of stellar mass ( @xmath43 ) falls in the range of @xmath52 peaks , whereas the number of peaks containing 90% of stellar mass ( @xmath44 ) displays a much broader range of @xmath53 .",
    "we note that , had we restricted the galaxy stellar mass range to @xmath54 or @xmath55 , the results do not change significantly .",
    "it is clear that there are large variations from galaxy to galaxy with respect to individual sf histories , as was already hinted in in figure  [ fig : sfr ] . behind this chaos , however ,",
    "collectively , an order is found , as will be shown in figure  [ fig : slope ] .",
    "-0.3 cm -0.8 cm    figure  [ fig : ntindiv ] shows @xmath43 ( red dots ) and @xmath44 ( blue squares ) as a function of temporal smoothing window @xmath45 for the four galaxies shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "we see that powerlaw fits - @xmath56 and @xmath57 - provide reasonable approximations .",
    "collecting all galaxies with stellar masses greater than @xmath58 at @xmath27 the results are shown in figure  [ fig : slope ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : slope ] shows the pdf of @xmath59 ( red histogram ) and @xmath60 ( blue historgram ) .",
    "we see that there are substantial variations among galaxies , which is expected .",
    "the most significant point is that a typical galaxy has @xmath61 and @xmath62 around @xmath63 . in other words , the galaxy population , collectively taken as a whole , displays significant orderliness .",
    "this point is re - enforced in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : slope ] , which is similar to figure  [ fig : ntindiv ] . but",
    "here , instead of showing powerlaw fits for individual galaxies , we compute the median of @xmath43 ( red dots ) and @xmath44 ( blue squares ) for all galaxies first as a function of @xmath45 and then show the fits to the medians .",
    "it is intriguing that a slope about @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) provides a quite good fit , where @xmath66 is often called the golden ratio .",
    "-0.3 cm -0.8 cm",
    "this paper is the third in the series  on the origin of the hubble sequence \" . utilizing _",
    "ab initio _ * l*arge - scale * a*daptive - mesh - refinement * o*mniscient * z*oom-*i*n cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( * laozi simulations * ) of the standard cold dark matter model , we undertake a unique study of the statistical properties of star formation episodes in galaxies .",
    "we find a relation between the number of star formation ( sf ) peaks per unit time , @xmath0 , and the size of the temporal smoothing window function , @xmath1 , used to define the peaks : @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , valid over the range of @xmath67gyr .",
    "it is expected that the findings do not significantly depend on precise cosmological parameters , since the responsible processes are mostly in the nonlinear regime , although it remains to be seen if the relation extends to below 10myr , where non - gravitational processes , including feedback processes , may introduce time scales of their own .",
    "the implication is profound : galaxy formation is temporally fractal and displays a self - organization up to at least one gigayear , with a @xcite dimension equal to @xmath6 .",
    "we attribute this temporal self - organization , tentatively , to interactions between galaxies that presumably trigger star formation peaks and are organized temporally in a way that is yet to be quantitatively understood .",
    "qualitatively , the found results may be explained as follows .",
    "one could envision that galaxies are normally ( at least at high redshift ) embedded in a gas reservoir , which is the potential fuel of star formation .",
    "when there is a trigger , some of this gas is driven inward to fuel star formation .",
    "the triggers are likely due to significant interactions between galaxies , such as major and minor mergers or close fly - bys of significant galaxies , or some torquing events , or some hydrodynamic events .",
    "the triggers may be democratically distributed temporally in the sense that at a given time baseline a large trigger is not usually preceded or followed by another large trigger , but rather by small triggers .",
    "one might even argue that in some rare cases , even if a large trigger does follow a preceding large one , a significant  drawdown \" of gas by the preceding sf peak may cause the second sf peak to be less powerful that it otherwise would .",
    "such compensated behavior could give rise to the temporal structures seen .",
    "were the triggers distributed randomly , then @xmath68 would be @xmath69 .",
    "should the triggers be completely correlated ( i.e. , a delta function in time ) , then @xmath68 would be @xmath9 .    since the triggering of sf peaks by galaxy interactions implies spatial correlations of galaxies , and given that galaxies are known to exhibit spatial fractals , such as the power - law galaxy two - point correlation function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results are strongly indicative that galaxy formation may be governed by a fundamental joint spatio - temporal self - organization . understanding the origin of this self - organization may hold a key to understanding galaxy formation .",
    "observational diagnostics to probe sf histories of galaxies with competitively good temporal resolution from a few myr to gyr , especially those that are applicable to a sufficient sample of galaxies , are highly wanted , in order to test the predictions made here .",
    "in addition , with the development of this new line of inquiry , more accurate observational characterizations of galaxy clustering at high redshift at the peak of star formation will be useful .    in spite of the apparent coincidence",
    ", it would be premature to emphatically relate @xmath70 to the golden ratio .",
    "nonetheless , the ubiquitous manifestations of the golden ratio in nature suggest that further investigations with higher statistical accuracies may be warranted .",
    "could the galaxy formation be golden after all ?",
