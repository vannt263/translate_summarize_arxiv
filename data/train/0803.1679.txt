    "the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) and inter - galactic medium ( igm ) are ubiquitous , and understanding the ism is crucial to many areas of astronomy such as cosmology ( e.g. , using sne ia or grbs as cosmological probes ) , the evolution of galaxies , and star formation ( e.g. , fall et al .",

    "the dust - to - gas ratio is a basic property of the ism , and it is difficult to measure in distant galaxies . in the galaxy , it is measured by comparing the optical extinction and ly@xmath7 absorption towards stars , and a typical value is @xmath8 mag @xmath9 atoms@xmath4 with a scatter about the mean of order 30% @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies have extended these measurements to additional lines of sight in our galaxy and to the lmc and smc , but the basic results are little altered aside from some evidence that the dust - to - gas ratios of the lmc and smc are modestly lower ( @xmath10% ) than in the galaxy ( see the review by draine 2003 and references therein ) . this absorption method is hard to apply to extragalactic sources where we lack precise knowledge of the intrinsic source spectra and tend to be probing low density parts of the igm using absorption lines in the spectra of quasars or @xmath11-ray bursts ( e.g. , kacprzak et al .",

    "an alternate approach is to use emission by the dust in the far - infrared to estimate a dust mass and then compare it to the estimated gas mass ( e.g. , contini & contini 2007 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing provides a means of studying the properties of the ism through differential absorption in the lens galaxies between the locations of the quasar images . by studying the _ differences _ in the absorption ( or extinction ) between multiple images , any contamination from the galaxy in the foreground ( milky way ) or the quasar host galaxy in the background",
    "is essentially eliminated and we can be confident that we are probing the ism of the lens galaxy . moreover , since we are comparing two images of the same quasar , the method has many of the quantitative advantages of the local approach using stars of known spectral type . in optical bands ,",

    "we fit the spectra of the lensed quasars using ` xspec v11.3.1 ` @xcite over the 0.38 kev observed energy range .",

    "although , absorption by the galaxy , lens and source is degenerate when fitting the spectrum of each image , the differential absorption @xmath28 between the lensed images is not and can be determined from a simultaneous fit to the spectra of the images .",
    "the time - delay at the source complicates the measurement , since if the absorption at source is variable ( e.g. , pks  1830@xmath29211 , dai et al .",
    "2008 ) , it will not be exactly canceled when comparing the two spectra . however , since the photo - electric absorption cross - section decreases with energy @xmath30 , the absorption at the source will affect the spectrum less .",
    "thus , we neglected the time - delay between the images and the absorption at the source redshift in this analysis .",
    "we note that a significant change in the spectral index on the time scale of the time delays will affect the results , especially for quasars with poor s / n spectra where the spectral index is degenerate with the absorption .",
    "the problem is less severe for quasars with moderate to high s / n spectra where the spectral index is less degenerate with  absorption during spectral modeling .    a second systematic error we must consider is microlensing of the quasar by the stars in the lens galaxy .",
    "our analysis is only affected by chromatic microlensing , where there are significant changes in the optical and x - ray spectra that alter the estimated extinction or absorption .",
    "indeed , it needs only be achromatic `` locally '' to separate optical and x - ray wavelength / energy regimes , as global shifts of the optical spectrum relative to the x - ray spectrum by microlensing also have no effect on the results . for the systems we consider",
    ", we have only limited control on the level of microlensing . while x - ray microlensing has been detected ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ; dai et al .  2003",
    "; blackburne et al . 2006 ; pooley et al . 2007 ) , x - ray spectral changes due to microlensing have yet to be detected in large part due to the limited sensitivity of the data .",
    "chromatic microlensing in the optical has been observed ( poindexter et al .  2007",
    "; anguita et al .  2008 ; eigenbrod et al .  2008 ) and can create systematic problems for estimates of the extinction as we had already discovered for he  1104@xmath291805  ( dai et al .",
    "we can , however , compare the optical and x - ray flux ratios , since the evidence to date is that the x - ray sources are much more compact than the optical ( kochanek et al .  2006 ;",
    "morgan et al .",
    "2008 ; chartas et al .",
    "2008 ) and so more strongly affected by microlensing . if the extinction and absorption - corrected flux ratios of the images agree , this is a good indication that our estimates are little affected by microlensing .",
    "we used the standard ` wabs ` and ` zwabs ` models in ` xspec ` to model the galactic absorption and absorption at the lens redshift .",
    "the ` wabs ` and ` zwabs ` models use cross sections from @xcite and assume a solar elemental abundance from @xcite .",
    "the galactic  is fixed using the values from @xcite .",
    "we fixed the intrinsic power - law index @xmath31 to be the same for both lensed images , and allowed the absorption at the lens to differ .",
    "since the average lens absorption and the power - law index are correlated in the spectral modeling , the uncertainties in absorption by the lens for the individual images are correlated . to accurately measure the uncertainties in the differential absorption , we used ` xspec ` to explore the full parameter space of the lens column densities and the power - law index .",
    "the fitting results are listed in table  [ tab : spec ] , and the spectra and best fit models are shown in figures  [ fig : sbs ] , [ fig : fbqs ] , and [ fig : bone ] .",
    "we also obtained the unabsorbed flux ratios between the quasar images as part of the model , and verified that adding absorption in the source does not alter the estimates of the differential column densities .",
    "we describe the results for each of the three lenses in the following sub - sections .",
    "sbs  0909 + 523  ( kochanek et al .  1997 ; oscoz et al .",

    "sbs  0909 + 523  is well studied in the optical bands , and the extinction curve has been measured using the differential extinction method ( mediavilla et al .",
    "2005 ) to be a galactic extinction curve with a strong 2175  extinction feature ( motta et al .  2002 ) .",
    "it is clear from the _ chandra _  spectra that image b is more heavily absorbed than image a. we estimate that the difference in the column densities is @xmath34  .",
    "there are several differential extinction measurements for this system ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ; motta et al . 2002 ; mediavilla et al .",
    "2005 ) , and we used the most recent measurement , @xmath35 , from mediavilla et al .",
    "combined with our differential absorption measurement , we obtained a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath36 mag @xmath3 atoms@xmath4 .",
    "the optical flux ratio of sbs  0909 + 523  has changed little from its discovery in 1997 through 2006 ( kochanek et al .",
    "1997 ; motta et al .",
    "2002 ; goicoechea et al .",
    "2008 ) suggesting that there is little microlensing variability even if there is evidence for microlensing from the difference between the continuum and emission line flux ratios ( motta et al .  2002 ; mediavilla et al .",
    "the extinction and absorption corrected optical ( @xmath37 , mediavilla et al .",

    "a more plausible interpretation is that the low energy part of the spectrum is absorbed . since the absorption is correlated with the power - law index in the spectral fitting , which is a severe problem for low s / n spectra , as an experiment we first fit the spectra in the hard band ( 28 kev ) to find a steeper , and more sensible , intrinsic power - law ( @xmath60 ) .",
