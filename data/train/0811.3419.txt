    "the study of entanglement measures in the eigenstates of condensed matter hamiltonians is a rapidly growing field of interdisciplinary research @xcite .",
    "while a great many results have been reported , the typical situation is that entanglement studies of condensed matter systems provide alternative signatures of phenomena already known from more traditional condensed - matter techniques . in this article , we use measures from quantum information to characterize a spin system which is poorly understood in the condensed matter literature , namely , spin rings with ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interactions frustrated by antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "we show how the unusual properties of this system are reflected in quantum information quantities .",
    "the systems we present are closed rings of @xmath0 spins .",
    "the study of finite - size quantum systems have enjoyed a huge resurgence in the past decade because of cold - atom and nanoscience developments , which provide the context for designing and studying finite - size hamiltonians for their own fundamental properties rather than as mere tools for investigating the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 .",
    "we will focus on a sequence of ground - state level crossings in such systems , which reflect lattice - incommensurate correlations .",
    "we show that certain measures of entanglement display remarkably strong parameter dependences near these level crossings .",
    "our calculations of the _ concurrence _ show that the entanglement structure of the states between successive level crossings is ideal for tuning the distance between spins which are mutually entangled .",
    "we also present some results on entanglement _ dynamics _ , again focusing on the effect of the level crossings .",
    "it is natural to think of ground state level crossings as finite - size analogs of first - order phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit . as a corollary ,",
    "one expects that ground state properties change suddenly at the crossing ( ` transition ' ) point and that away from the exact crossing point the system possesses no knowledge of the proximity of the crossing . in this",
    "regard , our quantum information quantities reveal a peculiarity of the crossings in our spin rings , because they seem to evolve in response to the proximity of the level crossings , already at some distance away from the parameter value where the crossing occurs , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ground state is `` aware '' of the nearby crossing .",
    "this counter - intuitive phenomenon is clearly seen in multi - spin ( but bipartite ) entanglements as well as fidelities , but not in traditional condensed - matter quantities such as correlation functions .",
    "note that , since the level crossings are not expected in the thermodynamic limit , this issue is meaningful only in our mesoscopic context .    to calculate a bipartite entanglement",
    ", one has to first decide on a partition . for a condensed - matter model or even its finite - size versions",
    ", there are a large number of ways in which the system can be bi - partitioned .",
    "a variety of different partitionings , and correspondingly different entanglements , have been used for entanglement studies in condensed matter models .",
    "many studies have focused on the entanglement between two sites as measured by the concurrence or negativity ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , or the entanglement between one spin / site with the rest ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "such measures generically are not expected to provide information different from traditional condensed matter quantities like 2-point correlation functions , since the entanglement measure can be related easily to correlation functions ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in this sense , many - site measures are more innovative .",
    "examples are block entanglement in 1d @xcite and in 2d @xcite , and more recently studied spatially disconnected partitions such as sublattice entanglement @xcite and entanglement between labeled itinerant particles @xcite .",
    "such entanglement measures are not easily related to usual correlation functions , and therefore hold the possibility of providing genuinely new tools for probing collective phenomena in many - particle systems . for our finite - sized chains , we will present entanglement results for various partitions , both two - site and many - site .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement measures in many - particle systems has attracted some attention recently @xcite , but is still a relatively poorly understood topic , reflecting the general difficulty of non - equilibrium physics in quantum condensed matter .",
    "entanglement dynamics has also gained interest from the quantum information perspective , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the context of adiabatic quantum computing @xcite and in the context of quantum state transfer ( ` quantum communication ' ) through spin chains @xcite .",
    "obviously , the number of different conceivable non - equilibrium situations is large ; we are forced to restrict the types of dynamics considered . in this article",
    "we will describe the entanglement dynamics after a sharp change ( _ quench _ ) of interaction parameter .    after describing in sec .",

    "dashed and full lines represent @xmath5 and @xmath6 interactions respectively . ]    we will mostly measure entanglement using the _ entanglement entropy_. the entanglement entropy between partitions @xmath2 and @xmath3 is defined using the reduced density matrix of one part ( e.g. , @xmath7 obtained by tracing over @xmath3 degrees of freedom ) to calculate the von neumann entropy , @xmath8 $ ] . since the purpose of using entanglement in many - particle systems is to provide viewpoints not present in usual condensed - matter measures , we want to consider more ` non - local ' entanglements .",
    "the partitions we choose for this purpose are shown in figure [ fig_partition - cartoons ] .",
    "the most obvious choice is for @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be spatially connected blocks , in particular for each partition to be a connected half of the ring ( fig.[fig_partition - cartoons]a ) .",
    "this partitioning is suggested by many existing results on block entanglement entropies in one dimension @xcite .",
    "another choice is to take all the odd sites as partition @xmath2 and the even sites as partition @xmath3  this is then the entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath3 _ sublattices _ , in usual quantum magnetism language ( fig.[fig_partition - cartoons]b ) .",
    "the entanglement between sublattices has been studied for a number of spin chains and lattices , and extrema of @xmath9 have been claimed to characterize some quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "note also that since it is natural to think of the @xmath5-@xmath6 chain as a ` zigzag ladder ' ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the sublattice entanglement is simply the entanglement between the two legs of such a ladder . in the mesoscopic ( finite - size ) context that we are interested in , a @xmath5-@xmath6 ring is likely to be implemented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_partition - cartoons]d ; the two ` legs ' are now two @xmath6 rings ( either inner or outer rings , or an upper and a lower layer ) , connected by zigzag @xmath5 interactions . from an experimental quantum information processing perspective , the sublattice entanglement is natural as it is simply the entanglement between inner and outer ( or upper and lower ) rings .",
    "since the antiferromagnetic interaction in our case is the _ next_-nearest - neighbor interaction , we extend the idea of the sublattice partition ( @xmath10 ) and also use the @xmath11 partition shown in fig.[fig_partition - cartoons]c .",
    "we call the entanglement entropies corresponding to the above three partitions respectively @xmath12 , @xmath4 , @xmath13 .",
    "another nonlocal quantity motivated by quantum information theory is the fidelity , the overlap between ground state wavefunctions at slightly different system parameters @xcite .",
    "we describe fidelities in our spin rings in section [ sec_fidelities ] .",
    "we also present results for more ` local ' measures of entanglement , namely , ( 1 ) entanglement entropy for 2-site partitions , and ( 2 ) the concurrence @xmath14 measuring the entanglement between sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the environment provided by the rest of the chain @xcite . the concurrence is defined as @xmath17 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 are the eigenvalues in decreasing order of the matrix @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the reduced density matrix of the two - site subsystem . since we will consider singlet states , two - site reduced density matrices are strongly constrained , and the concurrence is a simple function of the spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "two spins are entangled ( @xmath21 ) if the correlations between them are sufficiently antiferromagnetic , @xmath22 , and in that case @xmath23 ( derived in , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ; see also ref .  22 in @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of concurrence in various spin models is briefly reviewed from the literature in sec .",
    "[ sec_corrfn - concurr ] in order to provide context for our concurrence results .",
    "we are concerned with closed chains of @xmath24 localized spin-1/2 objects , _",
    "i.e. _ , a finite - size spin chain , interacting via the hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 , and @xmath15 is the site index obeying periodic boundary conditions appropriate to a ring .",
    "we define @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this spin chain is known for any even @xmath24 to have a singlet ground state for @xmath30 and a @xmath31-fold degenerate ferromagnetic ground state manifold for @xmath32 @xcite . at @xmath33 a singlet ground state",
    "is degenerate with the ferromagnetic manifold ; these degenerate states are known exactly @xcite . we will confine ourselves to the singlet region , @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical results are presented for ring sizes divisible by 4 , in order to avoid complications due to the parity of @xmath35 .",
    "the rings for other even sizes have very similar behavior .",
    "although far less studied compared to the @xmath36 case ( majumdar - ghosh chain ) , the frustrated ferromagnet hamiltonian has already been known for some time to possess some peculiar properties @xcite .",
    "more recently , this model has attracted a fresh surge of theoretical attention @xcite , partly due to the appearance of materials whose spin physics is described by this model ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "most studies concentrate on finite magnetic fields or finite temperatures and on properties in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , or very near the transition point at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "_ proliferation of ground state level crossings _  an unusual feature of the singlet region @xmath37 is the number of ground state level crossings , which proliferate as we increase the number of spins @xcite . for @xmath38 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , ... spins , there are respectively one , two , three , four , ... level crossings in this region .",
    "a very likely interpretation is that the natural correlations in the chain for @xmath34 are incommensurate with wavevector dependent on @xmath39 .",
    "this incommensurability is resolved in different ways by the different ground states . for larger rings ,",
    "there are a greater number of possibilities to accommodate the incommensurate correlations into the finite system , and hence the larger number of level crossings .",
    "the ground state lattice momentum alternates between @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the regions between successive level crossings .",
    "very similar level crossings appear in other spin models known or thought to have spiral correlations .",

    "@xcite ; ( 3 ) the frustrated ferrimagnetic chain of ref .",

    "the correlation function @xmath50 is three times @xmath51 ; we will discuss the latter as a function of @xmath52 . between @xmath53 and the first crossing , the signs of this quantity has the structure @xmath54 for @xmath55 , indicating that the state in this region has a ` spin - density - wave'-like @xmath56 structure .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_strcturefactor - n - qmax]a for @xmath43 .",
    "the oscillating magnitude / sign pattern also suggests ` nematic'-like correlations @xcite ; detailed distinctions are inappropriate since this is not a macroscopic phase .",

    "we now consider the concurrences @xmath14 between spins @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the rings . for most simple spin models ,",

    "long - range concurrences are rare ; the known examples correspond to specific phase transitions @xcite or to carefully constructed models and geometries @xcite .    in this context , it is noteworthy that our highly frustrated spin rings display nonzero concurrences at all length scales , depending on the interaction parameter @xmath46 ( fig .",

    ", there is nonzero concurrence between spins at opposite ends of the ring ( @xmath68 ) , reflecting the unusual long - range quantum correlations of the so - called udrvb state @xcite near @xmath33 .",
    "the behavior we have found indicates that the interaction here acts as a knob to tune the distance between spins with nonzero entanglement .",

    "the block entanglement entropy @xmath12 is large compared to , say , the singlet ground state of the nearest - neighbor heisenberg ground state , in which case @xmath721.28(1.354 ) for @xmath38 16(20 ) .",
    "this is not surprising , as the longer - range interaction causes larger entanglement .",
    "the majumdar - ghosh chain ( positive @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) similarly has relatively large block entanglement @xcite .",
    "the sublattice entanglement @xmath4 starts from zero at @xmath53 , because the two sublattices are decoupled in the @xmath73 limit .",
    "after the first level crossing , @xmath4 also reaches larger values . note that @xmath4 is quite large in the heisenberg and majumdar - ghosh chains ; in comparison the ground - state singlets of our system have somewhat lower sublattice entanglement .    the derivatives of @xmath70 and @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_entnglmnts - a ] lower panels ) are similar and have some striking features .",
    "first , at each level crossing except the leftmost , the derivatives have shapes reminiscent of a resonance , although there is no real divergence .",
    "in other words , the entanglement curves @xmath75 become steep but not completely vertical near each crossing .",
    "second , the @xmath76 curves appear to respond ( curve upward or downward ) already some distance away from the level crossing . while phase transition language is not completely appropriate for our mesoscopic arrangements , the crossings in this sense are loosely speaking `` second - order '' like rather than `` first - order '' like . finally , the @xmath76 curves at the leftmost crossing lacks the resonance - like feature , indicating that the first level crossing is different in nature .    the @xmath13 entanglement entropy is peculiarly small ( shown 4-fold magnified in fig .",
    "[ fig_entnglmnts - a ] ) , although the relevant reduced density matrix has the same dimensions as the other two partitions .",
    "this peculiarity remains unexplained at present .",
    "fidelity @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and its derivative .",
    "since @xmath79 is generally very close to unity , it is more convenient to plot @xmath80 on a logarithmic scale . note that the discontinuity at the leftmost level crossing is pronounced in the fidelity but almost invisible in its derivative . ]",
    "the ground - state fidelity is defined as the overlap between ground state wavefunctions at nearby parameter values : @xmath81 recent studies indicate that the fidelity provides useful signatures of quantum phase transitions @xcite . since we concentrate on mesoscopic spin structures , our purpose is not to study phase transitions but to present fidelity signatures of the level crossings .",
    "figure [ fig_fidelities ] presents fidelity data for @xmath78 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath82 again show striking resonance - like features .",
    "the special nature of the leftmost crossing is manifested even more dramatically here  the derivatives match almost perfectly across this crossing , even though the fidelities themselves are discontinuous .",
    "we now turn to the _ dynamics _ of entanglement in the frustrated ferromagnetic chain .",
    "while each entanglement measure has its own dynamics when the quantum state of the spin ring evolves outside equilibrium , a full study of the dynamics of all such measures is outside the scope of the present investigation , especially since such comprehensive entanglement dynamics studies are yet to be completed for simpler spin systems .",
    "we therefore restrict the presentation to the dynamics of the sublattice entanglement entropy ( @xmath4 ) .    the fact that our system has true level crossings , place them in the complete opposite limit to what is necessary for adiabatic quantum computing @xcite .",
    "it is therefore perhaps natural to study the opposite limit of adiabatic parameter changes , namely parameter _ quenches _ where @xmath46 changes as a step function . in an isolated finite spin ring , a quench of this type leads to oscillatory behaviors of most quantities , including entanglement entropies for various partitions ; there is no relaxation mechanism for the system to reach its ground state .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_time - evolution ] ( center panel ) . studying the evolution after a parameter quench from @xmath83 to @xmath84",
    "involves following the wavefunction @xmath85 explicitly in time , where the initial state @xmath86 is the ground state of @xmath87 .",
    "we performed this calculation by expanding the operator @xmath88 to sufficiently high order for each time step .",
    "we also explore relaxation issues , specifically the effect of the @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath40-@xmath41- crossings , by adding an artificial dissipation to the temporal evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig_time - evolution ] rightmost panel ) . instead of evolving in time @xmath89",
    ", we evolve in @xmath90 .",
    "this form of damping ( ` cooling ' ) preserves the lattice momentum but not the energy .",
    "we display entanglement evolutions for the large - damping case of @xmath91 , and also a single example with smaller damping , @xmath92 . with damping , the sublattice entanglement @xmath93 relaxes to the ground - state @xmath4 corresponding to the final @xmath46 only if the starting state has the same lattice momentum @xmath94 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "two level crossings divides the parameter space into regions i and iii with the same @xmath96 and an intermediate region ii with @xmath97 .",
    "the entanglement entropy after a quench to @xmath44 ( region i ) relaxes to the ` correct ' value if the starting ground state is in region i or iii , but not if it is in region ii .",
    "the structure of level crossings and alternating ground - state momenta thus allow selective targeting of quantum ground states , and therefore could serve as the basis of selective variations of the basic idea behind adiabatic quantum computing .",
    "left panel shows sublattice entanglement entropy for @xmath95 .",
    "center [ rightmost ] panel shows evolution of @xmath4 after a quench , without [ with ] dissipation .",
    "initial values are @xmath98 ( solid ) , @xmath99 ( dotted ) , @xmath100 ( dashed ) .",
    "final value is @xmath101 in each case .",
    "damping constant in rightmost panel is shown for @xmath91 for all three @xmath102 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the thick solid line has smaller damping , @xmath92 . in the presence of dissipation",
    ", @xmath4 relaxes to the ground state value when the initial state has same lattice momentum ( @xmath96 ) but not when the initial state has different lattice momentum ( @xmath97 ) . ]",
    "we have identified a mesoscopic system with unusual entanglement properties .",
    "our system is the finite - size analog of the intriguing ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "the surprising long - distance concurrence we have found , with tunable distance , makes this system ideal for various quantum information processing tasks .",
    "for example , _ entanglement transport _ is here simply a matter of tuning the interaction parameter while remaining in the ground state .",
    "our calculations of multi - qubit entanglement entropies and the fidelities have revealed unexpected aspects of the level crossings present in these systems .",
    "we have also presented entanglement dynamics results , again indicating possible quantum information processing applications .",
    "our work opens up a number of questions .",
    "first , our focus on the @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath40-@xmath41- level crossings raises the question : which of the entanglement behaviors reported here also carry over to the other systems where such level crossings have been observed ? to the best of our knowledge , no unified study of such crossings exists .",
    "our entanglement results call for a general investigation of finite - size level crossing sequences occurring as a result of incommensurate correlations .",
    "second , our study of entanglement dynamics treats only a minute fraction of the possible kinds of dynamics , and only a single entanglement measure out of many . since entanglement measures are sensitive to a variety of wavefunction characteristics not necessarily present in traditional condensed - matter measures such as correlation functions , the dynamics of these new measures present rich opportunities for characterizing non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "again , comprehensive investigations are called for , but the study of the evolution of various entanglements would be appropriately first done in simpler ( perhaps exactly solvable ) many - body systems .",

    "<S> the systems are closed finite spin-1/2 chains with ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interactions frustrated by antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the finite chains display a series of level crossings reflecting the incommensurate physics of the corresponding infinite - size chain . </S>",
    "<S> we present dramatic entanglement signatures characterizing these unusual level crossings . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on multi - spin and global measures of entanglement rather than only one - spin or two - spin entanglements . we compare and contrast the information obtained from these measures to that obtained from traditional condensed matter measures such as correlation functions . </S>"
