    "in the last decades , extensive literature has shown that the size of a large number of phenomena can be well described by a _ power law _ type distribution .",
    "the modeling of income distribution originated more than a century ago with the work of vilfredo pareto , who observed in his _",
    "cours dconomie politique _ ( 1897 ) that a plot of the logarithm of the number of income - receiving units above a certain threshold against the logarithm of the income yields points close to a straight line .",
    "this power law behaviour is nowadays known as _",
    "pareto law_.    recent empirical work seems to confirm the validity of pareto ( power ) law .",
    "for example , @xcite show that the distribution of income and income tax of individuals in japan for the year 1998 is very well fitted by a power law , even if it gradually deviates as the income approaches lower ranges . the applicability of pareto distribution only to high incomes",
    "is actually acknowledged ; therefore , other kinds of distributions has been proposed by researchers for the low - middle income region . according to @xcite , u.s .",
    "personal income data for the years 193536 suggest a power law distribution for the high - income range and a lognormal distribution for the rest ; a similar shape is found by @xcite investigating the japanese income and income tax data for the high - income range over the 112 years 18871998 , and for the middle - income range over the 44 years 195598 .",
    "@xcite confirm the power law decay for top taxpayers in the u.s . and",
    "japan from 1960 to 1999 , but find that the middle portion of the income distribution has rather an exponential form ; the same is proposed by @xcite for the u.k . during the period 199499 and for the u.s . in 1998 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to look at the shape of the personal income distribution in italy by using cross - sectional data samples from the population of italian households during the years 19772002 .",
    "we find that the personal income distribution follows the pareto law in the high - income range , while the lognormal pattern is more appropriate in the central body of the distribution . from this analysis",
    "we get the result that the indexes specifying the distribution change in time ; therefore , we try to look for some factors which might be the potential reasons for this behaviour .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : lognormalpatternwithpowerlawtail ] reports the data utilized in the analysis and describes the shape of the italian personal income distribution .",
    "[ sec : timedevelopmentofthedistribution ] explains the shift of the distribution and the change of the indexes specifying it over the years covered by our dataset .",
    "[ sec : concludingremarks ] concludes the paper .",
    "we use microdata from the historical archive ( ha ) of the survey on household income and wealth ( shiw ) made publicly available by the bank of italy for the period 19772002 @xcite .",
    "all amounts are expressed in thousands of lire .",
    "since we are comparing incomes across years , to get rid of inflation data are reported in 1976 prices using the consumer prices index ( cpi ) issued by the national institute of statistics @xcite .",
    "the average number of income - earners surveyed from the shiw - ha is about 10,000 .    fig .",

    "shows the profile of the personal income distribution for the year 1998 .",
    "we take the horizontal axis as the logarithm of the income in thousands of lire and the vertical axis as the logarithm of the cumulative probability .",
    "the cumulative probability is the probability to find a person with an income greater than or equal to @xmath4 : @xmath5 two facts emerge from this figure .",
    "firstly , the central body of the distribution ( almost all of it below the 99^th^ percentile ) follows a two - parameter lognormal distribution ( green solid line ) .",
    "the probability density function is : @xmath6\\ ] ] with @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean and the standard deviation of the normal distribution .",
    "the value of the fraction @xmath10 returns the so - called gibrat index ; if @xmath11 has low values ( large variance of the global distribution ) , the personal income is unevenly distributed . from our dataset",
    "we obtain the following maximum - likelihood estimates : @xmath12 @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 ; gibrat index is @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , about the top 1% of the distribution follows a pareto ( power law ) distribution .",
    "this power law behaviour of the tail of the distribution is more evident from fig .",
    "[ power_law_1998 ] ,     @xmath13 ; the estimated minimum income is @xmath14 thousand lire .",
    "the goodness of fit of ols estimate in terms of @xmath15 index is 0.9993 . ]    where the red solid line is the best - fit linear function .",
    "we extract the power law slope ( pareto index ) by running a simple ols regression of the logarithm of the cumulative probability on a constant and the logarithm of personal income , obtaining a point estimate of @xmath16 @xmath13 . given this value for @xmath17 ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath18 ( the income level below which the pareto distribution would not apply ) is 17,141 thousand lire .",
    "the fit of linear regression is extremely good , as one can appreciate by noting that the value of @xmath15 index is 0.9993 .    the distribution pattern of the personal income expressed as the lognormal with power law tails seems to hold all over our time span , as one can easily recognize from fig .",
    "[ time_development_of_income_distribution ] ,        which shows the shape of income distribution for all the years .",
    "the corresponding estimated parameters for the lognormal and pareto distributions are given in table [ estimation_results ] .",
    ".estimated lognormal and pareto distribution parameters for all the years ( standard errors are in parentheses ) .",
    "calculations are conducted using data and methods described in the text . for the lognormal distribution and the pareto distribution",
    "also shown are the values of gibrat index and @xmath15 index respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     which reports the _",
    "p_-values for all the cases we studied , the null hypothesis of equality of the two distributions can not be rejected at the usual 5% marginal significance level .",
    "therefore , the data are consistent with the assumption that a common empirical law might describe the growth dynamics of both gdp and pi , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gdp_pi_growth_rate ] ,        where all the curves for both gdp and pi growth rate normalized data almost collapse onto the red solid line representing the non - linear laplace fit .",
    "we next turn on the fluctuations of the indexes specifying the income distribution , i.e. the pareto and gibrat indexes , whose yearly estimates are reported in fig .",
    "[ fluctuations_of_pareto_and_gibrat_indexes ] .",
    "the left panel shows the fluctuations of pareto index over the years 19772002 .",
    "the black connected solid line is the time series obtained by excluding income from financial assets , while the red connected solid line refers to the yearly estimates obtained by the inclusion of the above - stated income , which was regularly recorded only since 1987 ( see note 2 ) .",
    "the course of the two series is similar , with the more complete definition of income showing a greater inequality because of the strongly concentrated distribution of returns on capital .",
    "the same can be said for the time series of gibrat index ( right panel ) .",
    "although the frequency of data ( initially annual and then biennial from 1987 ) makes it difficult to establish a link with the business cycle , it seems possible to find a ( negative ) relationship between the above - stated indexes and the fluctuations of economic activity .",
    "for example , italy experienced a period of economic growth until the late  80s , but with alternating phases of the internal business cycle : of slowdown of production up to the 1983 stagnation ; of recovery in 1984 ; again of slowdown in 1986 .",
    "as one can recognize from the figure , the values of pareto and gibrat indexes , inferred from the numerical fitting , tend to decrease in the periods of economic expansion ( concentration goes up ) and increase during the recessions ( income is more evenly distributed ) .",
    "the time pattern of inequality is shown in fig .",
    "[ gini_coefficient ] ,        which reports the temporal change of gini coefficient for the considered years . in italy",
    "the level of inequality decreased significantly during the  80s and rised in the early ",
    "90s ; it was substantially stable in the following years .",
    "in particular , a sharp rise of gini coefficient ( i.e. , of inequality ) is encountered in 1987 and 1993 , corresponding to a sharp decline of pareto index in the former case and of both pareto and gibrat indexes in the latter case .",
    "we consider that the decline of pareto exponent in 1987 corresponds with the peak of the speculative ` bubble ' begun in the early  80s , and the rebounce of the index follows its burst on october 19 , when the dow jones index lost more than 20% of its value dragging into disaster the other world markets .",
    "this assumption seems confirmed by the movement of asset price in the italian stock exchange ( see fig .",
    "[ fluctuations_of_historical_mib_index_and_gdp ] ,            left panel ) . as regards the sharp decline of both indexes in 1993 , the level and growth of personal income ( especially in the middle - upper income range ) were notably influenced by the bad results of the real economy in that year , following the september 1992 lira exchange rate crisis .",
    "the effects of recession ( visible in fig .",
    "9 , right panel ) produced a leftwards shift of the distribution and widened its range ; this , combined with a concentration of individuals towards middle income range , induced an increase in inequality .",
    "it would be expected that these facts cause the invalidity of pareto law for high incomes .",
    "this was well the case of italian economy during the mentioned years .",
    "[ power_law_1987_1993 ]     @xmath13 , while for 1993 data we have @xmath19 @xmath13 .",
    "these estimates were obtained by least - square - fit excluding about top and bottom 1.2% for 1987 data , and about top 1.4% and bottom 1.3% for 1993 data .",
    "ols @xmath15 values are 0.9993 and 0.9997 respectively .",
    "as one can note , a large deviation from pareto law is seen in both the years . ]",
    "@xmath13 , while for 1993 data we have @xmath19 @xmath13 .",
    "these estimates were obtained by least - square - fit excluding about top and bottom 1.2% for 1987 data , and about top 1.4% and bottom 1.3% for 1993 data .",

    "as one can note , a large deviation from pareto law is seen in both the years . ]",
    "shows the power law region in 1987 and 1993 .",
    "compared to other years , one can observe that the data can not be fitted by the pareto law in the entire range of high - income .",
    "in this paper we find that the italian personal income microdata are consistent with a pareto - power law behaviour in the high - income range , and with a two - parameter lognormal pattern in the low - middle income region .",
    "the numerical fitting over the time span covered by our dataset show a shift of the distribution , which is claimed to be a consequence of the growth of the country .",
    "this assumption is confirmed by testing the hypothesis that the growth dynamics of both gross domestic product of the country and personal income of individuals is the same ; the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test we perform on this subject lead us to accept the null hypothesis that the growth rates of both the quantities are samples from the same probability distribution in all the cases we studied , pointing to the existence of correlation between them .",
    "moreover , by calculating the yearly estimates of pareto and gibrat indexes , we quantify the fluctuations of the shape of the distribution over time by establishing some links with the business cycle phases which italian economy experienced over the years of our concern .",
    "we find that there exists a negative relationship between the above - stated indexes and the fluctuations of economic activity at least until the late  80s .",
    "in particular , we show that in two circumstances ( the 1987 burst of the asset - inflation ` bubble ' begun in the early  80s and the 1993 recession year ) the data can not be fitted by a power law in the entire high - income range , causing breakdown of pareto law .",
