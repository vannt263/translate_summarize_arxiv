    "flexible manufacturing plants , warehouses and logistic hubs depend on efficient , robust , adaptable and evolving internal transportation systems @xcite built upon mobile robots ( mrs ) or automatic guided vehicles ( agvs ) .",
    "agvs are gaining importance in automation , logistics and transportation systems as they can provide better flexibility and adaptability which is an essential need in case of automated systems @xcite .",
    "sophisticated control architecture is used for these purposes with the use of artificial intelligence to decrease production time and costs .",
    "traditionally , supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) software systems were used for controlling the agvs in multi - robot systems .",
    "the cost of customisation grows with the addition of new elements in the plant using scada . to counter this problem",
    "@xcite proposes agent - based models ( abms ) , where each agents have their individual controllers .",
    "though this type of controller architecture solves the problem of recurrent customisation costs , but individual agents can not improve based on the knowledge gained at the time of task execution .",
    "however , in case of multi - robot scenario commonly found in manufacturing industries , the performance of the agents can be collectively improved based on previous task execution experience .    for example , consider the following situation :        let there be multiple robots in the system and each robot has to traverse a definite path to reach their destinations , as given in figure [ prob_eg ] .",
    "the controller of agent a#2 has to compute the task of finding out the path for the movement of a#2 from source j#3 to destination w#2 .",
    "assume that , at time @xmath0 agent a#2 has its full battery level and can move with its maximum speed .",
    "the controller of a#2 can have two possible paths ( path#a and path # b ) to reach the destination .",
    "a#2 will not take the shorter path ( path#a ) to avoid the collision with agent ( a#1 ) which is accessing the same path at that time , thus maintaining the optimality criterion .",
    "now at time @xmath1 , the battery has drained out and the speed is slowed down .",
    "thus at that reduced speed path#b is not the optimal path as the possibility of collision with agent a#1 is no more if the shorter path is followed .",
    "however , a controller which does not consider updating dynamically the parameters like speed will not be able to correctly decide the path in the above scenario .",
    "thus the correct estimation and dynamic updating of these type of cost parameters is very much needed .",
    "there are many reported works @xcite to estimate different dynamic and physical parameters of individual agents of multi - robot systems .",
    "however , these works do not include these proposed cost parameters to be estimated and correctly updated .    in this work , we are trying to estimate these parameters to be used in various purposes . in summary ,",
    "the contribution of this work can be stated as follows :    1)we propose a different type of parameters ( cost parameter ) to be used at system level for overall improvement of performance 2)efficient estimation of cost parameter 3)a multi - level controller architecture for agent - based modelling to be used in co - ordination with cost parameter the rest of the paper is arranged as follows : first we formally describe the problem in section [ prob_defn ] , then in section [ prototype ] , we describe the experimentation platform used in this work .",
    "section [ probdef ] re - formulates the problem in the view of our architecture .",
    "some initial methods for identifying and estimating are described in section [ methods ] . in the following sections we present the experimental verification of our proposal before concluding with a discussion and further scope .",
    "in a typical abm , the physical parameters of each individual agents ( model parameters ) are governed by some process coefficients @xcite i.e.- the physical parameters which govern the system dynamics .",
    "these set of process coefficients , which are common for all the agents present in the system can be modelled as cost parameters of the whole system .",
    "for example , time to complete one particular task by the agvs , or time to traverse a particular route in the transportation floor can be thought of one such cost parameter . in this work",
    "we refer these process co - efficients as system level cost parameter henceforth .    among the recent works related to adaptive control of mobile robots , mr s state and physical dynamic parameters ( mass , inertia etc . ) estimation @xcite , state estimation @xcite , position and orientation estimation @xcite , obstacle estimation @xcite are devised to implement efficient control over the mobile agents and better path planner for the same agents in case of multi - robot systems ( mrs ) .",
    "previous works using the process co - efficients at system level has employed a consant cost or some heuristic functions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however this is inadequate to cope with the time - varying nature of these parameters .    in this work , unlike the previous work on parameter estimations which mostly concentrate on dynamic parameter estimation or positional parameter estimations of robots , we investigate and find an approach to estimate these time related cost parameters at the system level using the standard estimation filtering techniques . in current work",
    "we estimate traversal time of particular agv as an instance of above mentioned cost parameter .",
    "please note here that these traversal time parameter too , like any other robot dynamic parameters have sources of error from battery exhaustion , quality of the shop floor etc .",
    ", which tends to give different measurements depending on time . hence , the cost ( traversal time ) of each of the paths is continuously evolving .",
    "thus on every decision making step , the updated estimate of the traversal time helps the path planner to make precise decisions .",
    "the cost function for a given path to find the optimal one has been evaluated in @xcite using a fuzzy interference system ( fis ) .",
    "our work focuses on estimating the traversal time , considered as a cost parameter to reach a destination , to correctly perceive all the paths in order to enhance accurate and precise path planning .",
    "the process of identifying the cost parameters may start with assuming some initial values .",
    "now , the controller at system level can develop a set of values of all the parameters which govern the system dynamics and help in taking top level decisions .",
    "these set of values can be thought of as a knowledge base for the system .",
    "to study and evaluate the estimation methods of cost parameter suggested previously , a scaled prototype platform is required which consists of agvs in the laboratory set - up .",
    "experiments will be performed on a realistic scenario that emulates a common workshop , with work and storage cells and pathways in between .",
    "the main part of the scaled prototype is a flexible environment made of mobile robots and pathways in between with ports to load and unload .",
    "this is a typical replication of a transportation shop floor .",
    "the simulation of the same is done in the v - rep software .    as for the transportation agents ,",
    "hobby robots like boebot @xcite are being used .",
    "the environment is constituted using boxes which build up labyrinth like pathways for the robots to navigate .",
    "there are marks in the boxes which can be identified as ports where the loading and unloading has to be done by the transportation agents ( agvs ) .      in this work ,",
    "we shall focus on the controller architecture of a single agv . in case of multi - agent systems , the controllers are similar in each of the agents .",
    "our architecture also provides mechanism for communication and sharing of information between the agents @xcite .",
    "this aspect can be further utilized for better updation of parameters in future .",
    "the control structure consists of two major control layers ( figure  [ controller]).the top most layer is @xmath21 level and the @xmath20 level is below it . the @xmath20 level is divided into two sub levels @xmath20.1 and @xmath20.0 levels respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 level and @xmath21 both functions on each of the agents individually . here",
    ", the @xmath20.0 level can only communicate with the @xmath20.1 level and can not have any direct communication with the @xmath21 level .",
    "the @xmath20.1 level is the intermediate level which communicates with both @xmath20.0 level and @xmath21 level .",
    "the control levels given in the architecture ( figure  [ controller ] ) functions in co - ordination with each other to control the movements of the agents in the environment @xcite .",
    "the functions of controlling are more simplified in @xmath20.1 and @xmath20.0 levels .",
    "the @xmath21 level is engaged in controlling more complex functions like path planning and finding destination poses for each of the robots . in this architecture ,",
    "the inter - agent communications are done in the highest level ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "now , each of the robots in our scaled prototype platform have the @xmath20.0 ( implemented in the microcontroller board of the robot ) and @xmath20.1 ( implemented in the mounted raspberrypi in the robot ) levels together implemented in them and each of the @xmath21 is to be implemented in a personal computer ( pc ) with internet access which has established connection between the different devices .",
    "the synchronisation between the real platform and the simulation is done in a netlogo model .",
    "the transportation floor can be described in a topological view of the plant , which is a graph with nodes and arcs tagged with costs ( time , energy ) , as in figure  [ topology ] . here , in figure",
    "[ topology ] , @xmath3 to @xmath4 denote the nodes and symbols like @xmath5 denotes the arc names connecting @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "a path in the shop floor will always comprise of one or several arcs .        in figure  [ netlogosample ] ,",
    "a shop floor which is simulated in a simulation software has been described .",
    "this shop floor is designed as a graph as described in figure  [ topology ] . as denoted in figure  [ netlogosample ] , the nodes like @xmath7 denotes a valid port and @xmath8 denotes a bifurcation point where three possible arcs can be taken .",
    "the connecting lines ( @xmath9 ) between the two nodes @xmath8 and @xmath7 is an arc .",
    "according to figure  [ netlogosample ] , each of the arc in the shop floor is associated with some cost in terms of energy exhaustion , a dynamic obstacle , condition of the floor , load it carries etc as discussed in section [ prob_defn ] . the time to traverse an arc by a mobile robot ( figure [ netlogosample ] ) is thus conceptualised as cost parameter for that robot .",
    "hence , we formulate that parameter as @xmath10 , which is time - varying , where @xmath11 is for time , @xmath12 battery state of charge , @xmath13 is for tire condition , @xmath14 is for frictional force of the floor , @xmath15 is for obstacle dependencies.@xmath10 is time - varying from the perspective that at a particular instance of the time , the cost of that particular arc is dependent on battery discharge , condition of the floor or any dynamic obstacle .",
    "hence , for the arc @xmath16 in figure  [ netlogosample ] , the cost parameter is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "also , for the same robot , for the arc @xmath18 , the cost parameter will be @xmath19 .",
    "now , a particular path will comprise of one or more arcs .",
    "thus , for a particular path traversal , there are one or more of @xmath10 for a particular robot .",
    "our work focuses on estimating all of such @xmath10 to get the next prediction on the next time instance on - line and recursively update all the prediction values for all the @xmath10 estimates till that time in order to implement a better path planning and control strategy .",
    "mostly , when the parameter identification is done , the parameters include either robot manipulator parameters@xcite for precise robot functioning or on model - based mobile robot controller @xcite .    for parameter identification and estimation ,",
    "the standard methods include least - square estimator approach @xcite , two - level on - line parameter identification approach @xcite , weighted least - square technique for identifying model parameters for manipulator @xcite , least - square moving window method @xcite , recursive least square ( rls ) method @xcite , predictions and corrections based algorithm @xcite .",
    "further to this , the system state vector was measured at any time and the unknown dynamic parameters are estimated using a kalman filter ( kf ) @xcite .    in @xcite , a least square moving window method ( lsmw ) is suggested . here ,",
    "the data set ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) of length @xmath2 is such that , @xmath22 where , @xmath23=(@xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26, ...... ,@xmath27 ) , @xmath28=(@xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31, ...... ,@xmath32 ) and @xmath33 is the measurement noise .    now , with a window size @xmath34 such",
    "that @xmath35 , the number of estimations of @xmath36 will be @xmath37 + 1 .",
    "the estimation is given by , @xmath38 where , @xmath39 and @xmath40 = ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , ......... , @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 = ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , ......... , @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 = 1,2, ...... ,@xmath49 with the estimation error @xmath50 also , @xcite has suggested a rls algorithm based on both constant and variable forgetting factor .",
    "after the least square method , the estimate obtained at time @xmath11 is @xmath51 where , @xmath52 = ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ......... , @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 = ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ......... , @xmath55 ) , the estimation of time @xmath56 is calculated as @xmath57 where , @xmath58 is the forgetting factor which needs to be carefully set which is a design issue . according to @xcite , for time - varying @xmath58",
    "a good approach is to set it to a function of estimation error @xmath59 as follows @xcite : @xmath60 where , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are all design parameters .",
    "the kfs and the ekfs are also useful approach for estimation and optimisation .",
    "the kf is often used when the parameter is linearly time - varying , where the equation of the system model is given a s : @xmath64 where , @xmath65 is the parameter to be estimated and @xmath66 is the observation of @xmath65 . also , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are white , zero mean , gaussian noise .",
    "the kf results from the recursive application of the prediction and the filtering cycle as given by the following equations : @xmath74 @xmath75\\quad\\\\ k(k ) & = p(k\\mid{k-1})c^t_k[c_kp(k\\mid{k-1})c^t_k   + r]^{-1}\\\\ p(k\\mid{k } ) & = [ i -k(k)c_kp(k\\mid{k-1})]\\\\ \\end{aligned } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where , @xmath76 is the new estimation for the variable @xmath77.equation  [ prediction_cycle ] gives the prediction cycle of the kf dynamics and equation  [ correction_cycle ] gives the filtering cycle . here , @xmath78 is the kf gain . here , in our work , @xmath10 is the parameter which is to be estimated .",
    "thus , @xmath65 in the general kf equation , is @xmath10 in our application .",
    "the experimental set - up is conceptualized like a prototype transportation platform ( section [ prototype ] ) where the agvs perform specific tasks given to them , like loading and unloading . for measuring the cost parameter of the system ( as formulated in section [ probdef ] ) ,",
    "the platform is conceptualized consisting of three agvs , each of them have the @xmath20.0 and @xmath20.1 levels implemented and all of them are individually controlled by their @xmath21 level .",
    "now , each of the agvs have to traverse three different paths in the environment ( figure  [ netlogosample ] ) and let each of the three paths have 2 different types of arcs .",
    "therefore , each of the robot will have 2 different @xmath10 parameters to be estimated.for the measurement simplifications , only the battery charge level and effect of the frictional force of the floor is considered .",
    "thus , @xmath10 is re - formulated as @xmath79 .        as in figure",
    "[ test_scenario_pic ] , @xmath80 is required is required to go from @xmath81 to @xmath82 and there are 2 arcs in that path .",
    "so there are 2 cost parameters for @xmath80 namely , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "similar is the case for both the other agvs ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) . for the time being , the estimation method is applied to estimate one such cost parameter variable to validate whether the standard estimation methods , generally used for position or mechanical parameter estimation , actually works for time variable estimations .",
    "let that cost parameter be denoted as @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath87 is measured till the battery of the mobile robot drains out and the robot comes to complete halt .",
    "the variable @xmath87 is dependent only on the of the battery charge and the frictional force of the floor where the robot is moving .",
    "the plot of the observed ( measured ) @xmath87 over time is given in figure  [ measure_c(t ) ] .",
    "several epochs of tests are done to measure the same @xmath87 in order to ensure that we are measuring the right data .",
    "we can observe that the values follow a steady fall during the initial stage then follows a constant for a span of time and then again rises up to a big magnitude before the robot finally stops moving .",
    "this plot shows that @xmath87 is influenced by the battery discharge profile which is given in figure  [ battery ] , where the state of charge of the batteries used in the platform ( eneloop batteries ) follows a similar profile .",
    "hence , the battery s state of charge can be predicted from the observed data of @xmath87 as the battery s state of charge influences the values of @xmath87 .      at first the least square moving window method is implemented to find the estimation .",
    "the window size was taken as 5 .    according to the figure  [ lsmw ] , least square",
    "moving window method provides estimates over the time with the standard deviation of estimation error being of the order of @xmath88 .",
    "the error level is being reduced by applying the recursive least square ( rls ) method , whose estimation results are shown in figure  [ rls ] .",
    "the mean of the estimation error by rls method is further reduced to @xmath88 .",
    "the estimation by the kalman filtering is given by the figure  [ kf ] .",
    "in figure  [ kf ] , the estimation error is of the order of @xmath89 ( as given in the plot ) .",
    "hence , we can infer that the kalman filtering method provides the most suitable estimation for the cost parameter which provides traversal time or time of completion .",
    "all the computations done are enough short in time to be obtained in real time .",
    "while , @xcite proposed to calculate the fuzzy cost function when the simple ant colony optimisation ( saco ) algorithm is implemented for optimal path generation , our work suggests to identify and estimate the cost parameter ( like @xmath90 ) values during the optimal path generation on every iteration , by the suggested method . in this way , when the costs of the time - varying parameters of the system changes the optimal path to the target can be known more efficiently .",
    "the real time values of these cost parameters are to be used and updated in the knowledge base of the system used for characterization .",
    "this implies the data obtained from the mobile agent about the parameters can be used to predict the future time and energy to do perform similarly .",
    "these predictions of the future data are useful to optimize the synchronization between the simulation and the reality in control systems based on the architecture proposed in our research group @xcite .",
    "the control structure which runs the simulation and the reality will use these predicted data in order to make decisions about the motion of the mobile agents .",
    "when the time and energy predictions in reality match with that of the simulation then the event pair mismatching phenomenon can be controlled to its minimum , although can not be made null .",
    "in fact , with synchronization tests on simple shop floor traffic networks , it is observed that less than 5 percent of events are synchronized out of time either because of bad time estimation or because simulation takes longer than reality ( this affects real - time control as it switches the system from a hard real - time to a soft real - time one ) .",
    "further , we can use the concept of estimation of the cost parameters not only to make a better navigation and path planning but also to make a profit based approach for the architecture of the system . in this approach , the cost incurred in performing a work ( like traversing a distance by an agent )",
    "can be always made lower than possible gain acquired after performing the work and this will eventually make the whole team of robots a better performer .",
    "in this work we have focused on the on - line estimation of the traversal time for agvs in the transportation floor to commute from one source location to target location .",
    "different estimation methods haven been studied to estimate these kind of cost parameters , namely lsmw , rls and kf methods .",
    "they have been tested against traversal time data series that have been obtained from a real robot in a scale mrs prototyping platform . in the study",
    ", kf outperformed lsmw and rls by exhibiting less estimation error .",
    "the estimated values further can be incorporated with the path planning algorithms to correctly find the optimal path on each iteration as the cost of the system evolves on time . in the current work",
    ", only one such cost parameter estimation has been investigated .",
    "future investigations can include identifying cost parameters by using other robots cost parameters or work with non - scalar parameters such as random variables .",
