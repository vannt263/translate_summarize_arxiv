    "planetary systems are thought to evolve from circumstellar disks around young stellar objects . in this",
    "context , dynamical and chemical evolution of circumstellar disks has been extensively studied with various observational and theoretical methods to reveal how planets are formed .",
    "recent advanced astronomical facilities of both ground - based 8 - 10 m class telescopes and space missions such as _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , _ iso _ , _ akari , _ and _ spitzer _ have revealed morphological and spectroscopic features of circumstellar disks in great detail with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution .",
    "the most striking discovery was the direct detection of circumstellar disks in orion nebula cluster imaged by @xmath7 in its early operation phase @xcite .",
    "they exhibited clear morphology of the circumstellar disks as a silhouette in front of the very bright background nebula illuminated by o , b stars ( trapezium stars ) in the cluster .",
    "this was a huge milestone for studies of the protoplanetary disks , as it showed that the circumstellar disks could be directly studied with high spatial resolution ( @xmath6 0@xmath81 ) .",
    "the silhouette disks have definite advantages , because various basic properties of the circumstellar disk such as its shape , size , inclination angle , and composition are unambiguously determined .",
    "it provides us with excellent opportunities to investigate the circumstellar disk as a progenitor of the planetary system .",
    "water is a key element at the top of the hierarchy of building blocks to complex , prebiotic molecules . in our solar system",
    ", water is thought to be brought onto the surface of a terrestrial planet such as the earth in the form of water ice in its solid phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search for the water ice in circumstellar disks is of extreme interest to investigate the possible emergence of the life elsewhere .",
    "the water ice feature at the shortest wavelength appears at 1.5@xmath0 , 2.0@xmath0 , and 3.1@xmath0 in the near infrared region , which is accessible from the ground . in particular , among those features , the water ice absorption at 3.1@xmath0 is the most important in terms of its detectability .",
    "the water ice absorption at 3.1@xmath0 has been detected toward various astronomical sources including young stellar objects since its first detection by @xcite . while in most of the cases",
    "the detected water ice is attributed to the foreground cloud and/or their envelope around the sources , recently the water ice absorption in the circumstellar disks has been detected successfully @xcite . however ,",
    "those detections are based on the scattered light by the circumstellar particles around the central star , and the geometry of the water ice absorption is not clear .",
    "water ice absorption seen directly through the silhouette disks will be easier to interpret than those detections .",
    "another advantage comes from the fact that the m42 and m43 regions suffer from less extinction @xcite , which means that the foreground contamination is minimized for the measurement of the water ice in the circumstellar disk .",
    "taking into account the fact that majority of stars are born in high mass star forming regions , it is important to investigate the closest high mass star forming regions of m42 and m43 .",
    "the silhouette disks were initially discovered in the orion nebular cluster ; m42 @xcite , and recently the sample is largely expanded with several additional silhouette disks found also in m43 @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the distance to m42 is adopted as 414 pc @xcite , while 436 pc is used for m43 @xcite .",
    "we present the spectra of five sources with silhouette disks in the m42 and m43 regions , namely d121 - 1925 , d182 - 332 , d183 - 405 , d218 - 354 @xcite , and d216 - 0939 @xcite . in  2 ,",
    "the observational procedures and applied data analysis are described . in",
    " 3 , the continuum of each target is determined and the optical depth of the water ice feature is derived . the origin of the detected water ice , the possible cause of the different optical depth of the water ice , and the interesting nature of the detected water ice in d216 - 0939 disk are discussed in  4 .",
    "the conclusion is described in  5 .",
    "the combination of near infrared imaging ( 1.44.2@xmath0 ) and spectroscopy ( 1.94.2@xmath0 ) were conducted as a series of the observations from 2000 december to 2007 september .",
    "all the observations were performed under seeing limited conditions using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the subaru 8.2 m telescope atop maunakea , hawaii .",
    "ircs was initially mounted at the cassegrain focus of the telescope in 2000 , and moved onto the nasmyth focus on 2005 december for the upgraded adaptive optics system ( ao188 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pixel scales became slightly finer by a factor of 0.89 after moving to the nasmyth focus .",
    "the observation log is shown in table  [ tbl - obslog ] with a seeing size on those nights .",
    "the seeing values were good in most of the observing runs .",
    "but the seeing was poor in some cases , especially for d218 - 354 .",
    "sky conditions throughout all of the observing nights were photometric .",

    "the @xmath18 of 0.72 is likely to be underestimated due to contribution of the reflection nebula in the optical band .",
    "lastly , d121 - 1925 has moderate distance from @xmath23 ori c ( 2471 ) and the @xmath27 should be comparable to 2.70 around its vicinity star jw 370 .",
    "the foreground water ice detected toward d121 - 1925 is consistent with the estimated @xmath18 of 5.83 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the overall structure of m42 @xcite , the foreground materials should act as a good shield from the uv radiation to keep the water ice around the grains in the disk .",
    "therefore , the null detection of water ice in the disk of d121 - 1925 needs to be explained in some other way .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the water ice features in our targets is related to the disk geometry .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite clearly detected the water ice features in the disk whose inclination is very high ( @xmath37 @xmath38 70@xmath2 ) owing to the abundant materials for the absorption .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the disk inclination is an important parameter for the water ice detection in their disk model of crbr 2422.8 - 3423 . in their model , the inclination of 69 @xmath19 3@xmath2 seems to act as the critical angle .    in the disk with an inclination angle smaller than the critical angle",
    ", the expected optical depth is rapidly decreasing to zero .",
    "the two sources : d121 - 1925 and d183 - 405 are thought to have the small inclination angles of 51@xmath2 and 39@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "no water ice detection in the disk of those objects is consistent with the pontoppidan et al . model . for the remaining three sources : d182 - 332 ,",
    "d218 - 354 , and d216 - 0939 with higher inclination angle of the disks , the observed optical depths of the water ice absorption are presented in figure  [ fig - inctau ] with an overplot of the @xmath39 shown by @xcite . in the case of d216 - 0939 disk with the inclination angle of 7580@xmath2 above the critical angle ,",
    "the detected optical depth is explained well by this model .",
    "optical depth of the water ice vs. inclination angle of the disk . filled square with error bar shows the detection of the water ice for the d216 - 0939 disk .",
    "open squares represent the estimated upper limit ( 1@xmath40 ) for non - detection of the water ice for the d182 - 332 and d218 - 354 .",
    "d121 - 1925 and d183 - 405 with lower inclination angle are not shown in this figure .",
    "solid line is the expected optical depth of the water ice in the model for crbr 2422 - 3423 disk derived by @xcite . ]    on the other hand , the question should arise for d182 - 332 and d218 - 354 in this scheme . as for d182 - 332 ,",
    "the expected optical depth is rather low ( @xmath24 0.1 ) , and so systematic errors for spectral fitting and/or photometric measurements errors could be the cause of this discrepancy .",
    "the inconsistency for the case of d218 - 354 which has rather high inclination angle ( 65@xmath2 ) seems more serious .",
    "this should be explained by a higher critical angle of the disk inclination and/or lower abundance of the water ice .",
    "considering that circumstellar disks so far detected exhibit a wide variety of morphology in scattered light , it is possible that the same critical angle of the disk inclination as in crbr 2422.8 - 3423 should not necessarily be applied to all the disks .",
    "in fact , the d216 - 0939 disk seems to have a different critical angle of @xmath6 77@xmath2 judging from its flared disk , because the critical angle is expected to be determined by the opening angle of the disk .",
    "the problem with both the cases of d182 - 332 and d218 - 354 might be resolved with the optical depth curve shifted accordingly , if they have a higher critical angle of the disk inclination .",
    "regarding the possible difference of the water ice abundance , we note that it should be affected significantly by much more intense uv field for the disks ( d182 - 332 , d183 - 405 , and d218 - 354 ) located at the vicinity of o , b stars .",
    "as mentioned in the above sections , @xcite revealed that the d216 - 0939 disk has an inclination angle of 75 - 80@xmath2 which is well matched to the flared angle of the disk ( 77@xmath2 ) .",
    "this means that this target might provide with very unique opportunity for us to directly measure the absorption feature through the disk toward the central star . in the following ,",
    "this suggested interesting geometry is re - examined using our near infrared data .    using the optical depth parameters of @xmath32 = 0.67 and @xmath33 = 538 @xmath34 ,",
    "the column density of the water ice toward d216 - 0939 is estimated to be 1.80 @xmath3 10@xmath41 cm@xmath25 in the same way as the above .",
    "since the detected water ice is known to reside in the disk region of d216 - 0939 , the visual extinction caused by the disk material ( @xmath42 ) along a light - of - sight toward d216 - 0939 can be derived as 20.7 mag .",
    "this extinction is usually large enough to make the central source undetectable at the optical band .",
    "thus , it is most likely that the previously measured optical flux could be considered to originate from the indirect reflected light from the central star .",
    "in fact , the position of the peak at @xmath12 and @xmath10 in our data shows a marginal offset into the direction perpendicular to the d216 - 0939 disk , while the peak position at @xmath10 and @xmath9 falls into the same area within the measurement accuracy ( figure  [ fig - pos ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the flux shorter than 1.65@xmath0 appears as the reflected light .",
    "however , this result apparently conflicts with no detection of the positional shift of the peak flux at 0.550@xmath0 and 0.658@xmath0 bands reported by @xcite .",
    "although it might be explained by the appropriate size of the large grains , this result is required to be addressed by using more sensitive and higher spatial resolution imaging in future .",
    "possible change of the peak position of the d216 - 0939 flux .",
    "the reference position is determined by the position of jw 671 : the vicinity star of d216 - 0939 .",
    "the peak at the longer wavelength shows the possible positional change toward the direction perpendicular to the disk .",
    "it may suggest that flux at shorter wavelength ( at least @xmath241.65@xmath0 ) comes from the scattered light by material around the star . ]    apart from the position offset , the radial profiles of d216 - 0939 at each band are investigated in figure  [ fig - rad ] to estimate the contribution of the reflected light to the flux .",
    "this figure presents the radial profiles for both directions perpendicular to and along the d216 - 0939 disk ( position angle : 83@xmath2 and 173@xmath2 , respectively ) .",
    "jw 677 @xcite which is a brighter star located 1084 south is chosen as a reference of the point spread function ( psf ) . in the profiles at @xmath12 and @xmath10 ,",
    "the extended features are clearly seen for both directions and the profiles along the disk appear more extended .",
    "thus , the photometric results at @xmath12 and @xmath10 for d216 - 0939 include the scattered light component . on the other hand , at @xmath9 ,",
    "no significant extended feature can be observed for the direction perpendicular to the disk .",
    "the radial profile at @xmath9 along to the disk implies the possible extended flux .",
    "higher signal - to - noise imaging with higher spatial resolution is required for concrete conclusion for this extended feature .",
    "radial profiles of d216 - 0939 and jw 677 .",
    "upper panels are measured at the position angle of 53to 113 , which is in the direction perpendicular to the d216 - 0939 disk .",
    "lower panels are parallel to the disk direction with the position angle of 143to 203 . ]",
    "considering the lack of change of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 peak position ( figure  [ fig - pos ] ) and the lack of evident difference in the @xmath9 profile of d216 - 0939 and jw 677 ( figure  [ fig - rad ] ) , we assume that the @xmath9 light reaches us directly from the central star .",
    "the derived visual extinction , @xmath42 , and column density of the water ice , @xmath28 , put direct constraints on physical parameters of the disk such as mass and density .",
    "firstly , based on the relationship of @xmath43 = ( 1.59 @xmath3 10@xmath44 ) @xmath3 @xmath18 cm@xmath25 between @xmath43 and @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath43 is derived as 3.29 @xmath3 10@xmath45 cm@xmath25 .",
    "this number is in good agreement with the relationship between @xmath43 and the inclination angle of the silhouette disks in m42 found by @xcite .",
    "the silhouette disk of d216 - 0939 exhibits the clear structure of the disk , whose outer radius and scale height at the outer edge are measured to be 13 ( 572 au ) and 06 ( 264 au ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the path length can be estimated to be 8.56 @xmath3 10@xmath46 cm and the averaged density can be calculated to be 6.38 @xmath3 10@xmath4 g @xmath5 accordingly . if this density is uniformly adopted to the entire disk , the total disk mass is calculated to be 1.94 @xmath3 10@xmath47 m@xmath48 .",
    "the derived mass is smaller by a factor of 20 than the one from the submm measurement .",
    "the difference can be naturally explained by the fact that the mid - plane of the circumstellar disk has higher density than the surface of the disk ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "the most noticeable feature represented in the water ice absorption of the d216 - 0939 disk is the peak of the optical depth and its profile . in comparison to the water ice band of edge - on disks in taurus molecular cloud shown in @xcite , the overall profile",
    "is shifted to longward wavelengths together with the peak absorption ( figure  [ fig - taucomp - eo ] ) .",
    "in fact , the enhancement of the water ice feature around 3.2@xmath0 has never been seen in any astronomical sources before , and the cause of this feature could be very peculiar . the origin of this broad absorption in the red part ( @xmath38 3.4@xmath0 ) could be a scattering effect and/or other molecules such as solid methanol and ammonia hydrate @xcite . however , the determination of the red continuum adopted by a black body with a single temperature has some uncertainty and it is required to note the possibility that the optical depth at longer wavelengths may be overestimated .",
    "comparison of the normalized optical depths of the water ice between d216 - 0939 and edge - on disk sources : hk tau b and hv tau c. overall , the optical depth of the water ice in the d216 - 0939 disk is displaced to longer wavelengths . ]    regarding the peak of the optical depth of the water ice band , it is well known that the higher degree of crystallization and larger grain size for water ice shift the optical depth peak to a longer wavelength @xcite .",
    "the fully crystallized water ice with a grain radii of @xmath1 0.5@xmath0 shows a sharper peak around 3.1@xmath0 ( ex . * ? ? ?",
    "there are several sources showing their peak around 3.1@xmath0 , which is attributed to different degrees of crystallization .",
    "for the following discussion , it is noted that those sources do not show the 3.2@xmath0 absorption . for the case of the d216 - 0939 ,",
    "the absorption seen around 3.2@xmath0 is significantly enhanced , whereas the first peak position of the detected water ice is located around 3.1@xmath0 which agrees with the signature of the crystallized water ice .",
    "the peak shift of the optical depth for the fully crystallized water ice was presented by @xcite . in their work ,",
    "the fully crystallized water ice with a grain size of 1@xmath0 shows the peak around 3.2@xmath0 .",
    "taking into account fully crystallized water ice with such a large size ( @xmath61@xmath0 ) , the model fitting to the profile of the optical depth of the water ice is considered with the following procedure , which is the same method with which @xcite have obtained a sufficient fit to the water ice features found in their sources .",
    "the optical depth of the water ice absorption is assumed to be a linear composition of the mass extinctions of amorphous , and partially and fully crystallized water ice with a grain size of 0.1 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.5@xmath0 .",
    "we used the grain model described by @xcite to calculate the water ice optical depth profile , and the mass extinction curves are derived using the program miex @xcite with an assumption of spherical and compact ice particles . using the mass extinction parameters for each type of water ice , the best fit to the optical depth profile of the water ice detected in the d216 - 0939 disk",
    "is found to result from the combination of the large - sized ( 0.8@xmath0 ) fully crystallized water ice and the small - sized ( 0.1@xmath0 ) pure amorphous water ice with a mass ratio of 2.5:1 .",
    "the best fit curve is presented in figure  [ fig - taucomp - model ] .",
    "the grain growth indicated by this result is predicted to occur in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "therefore , this grain growth signature of the water ice feature strongly supports the origin of the detected water ice to be in the disk . as for the grain size of 0.8@xmath0 , it is significantly smaller than the grain size ( 1.94@xmath0 ) found by @xcite for the largest silhouette disk d114 - 426 .",
    "it may be due to different environments caused by uv radiation .",
    "comparison of the normalized optical depth of the water ice between the model and the detection .",
    "solid line shows composition of purely crystallized and pure amorphous water ice by 2.5:1 .",
    "this model is found to match sufficiently to explain the absorption profile at wavelengths shorter than 3.3@xmath0 .",
    "the extra absorption at 3.4@xmath0 seen in the spectrum could be attributed to a scattering effect and/or various possible carriers of the c - h bond such as ch@xmath49oh ice . ]",
    "the detection of the fully crystallized water ice indicates that the detected water ice has experienced thermal processing to a temperature of @xmath6 160k .",
    "considering water ice particles are seen with a viewing angle of 7580@xmath2 @xcite , it should be located almost on the surface of the flared disk and the temperature of the water ice particles could be heated by radiation from the central star .",
    "@xcite interpreted that their spatially resolved detection of the crystallized water ice toward ylw 16a in @xmath30 ophuichus molecular cloud comes from the outer surface of the disk . in our data , the water ice distribution in radial direction can not be probed directly .",
    "since the grain growth is expected to occur most effectively in the mid - plane of the circumstellar disk , it would be natural to consider some mixing process to exchange the materials between the mid - plane and the surface of the disk .",
    "the mid - plane of the circumstellar disk is cold enough to keep water ice in amorphous form , and the detected large - size fully crystallized water ice at the surface of the disk likely originates from the heating of large - size amorphous water ice transferred from the mid - plane of the disk . in this scenario ,",
    "the detected small - size amorphous water ice particles should reside at the colder and less dense outer region of the disk that is further away from the central star than the crystallized water ice .",
    "we obtained 1.94.2@xmath0 spectra for five targets associated with the distinct silhouette disk . for three objects :",
    "d182 - 332 , d183 - 405 , and d218 - 354 no water ice feature was detected primarily due to lower angle of the disk inclination than required for detection of the water ice signature .",
    "in addition those objects are too close to the o , b stars exciting the region .",
    "whereas d121 - 1925 exhibits a slight water ice band at 3.1@xmath0 with an optical depth of 0.12 , a nearby star shows almost the same absorption as this object .",
    "thus , the origin of those water ice absorption could be common , and it is most likely attributed to the foreground materials of the water ice .",
    "in contrast , the comparison star near d216 - 0939 shows no water ice feature , while the moderate absorption ( @xmath32 @xmath6 0.67 ) of the water ice at 3.1@xmath0 toward the d216 - 0939 is definitely seen .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the water ice toward d216 - 0939 should be localized in @xmath62000 au scale and that the material responsible for the absorption could be inside the disk of d216 - 0939 . due to",
    "the clear morphology and suggested ideal geometry for our line - of - sight , we directly derived the average density on the disk surface to be 6.38 @xmath310@xmath4 g @xmath5 . remarkably , the profile of the optical depth of the water ice shows the signatures of fully crystallized water ice with a grain size of @xmath6 0.8@xmath0 .",
    "secondary composition of small amorphous , that is , non - evolved water ice indicates that this material could exist in outer region of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the water ice feature at 3.1@xmath0 is at a wavelength where diffraction - limited images can be easily obtained by using adaptive optics ( ao ) with the 8-m subaru telescope .",
    "the spatial resolution of @xmath6 0@xmath808 at 3.1@xmath0 is comparable to the resolution achieved by @xmath7 in the optical .",
    "future ao observations of the silhouette disks can help to reveal the morphology of the water ice absorption in more detail .",
    "we thank all the subaru telescope staff for maintaining the ircs and supporting the observation .",
    "we also acknowledge the development efforts of the instrument to the development team members to realize these high sensitivity observations .",
