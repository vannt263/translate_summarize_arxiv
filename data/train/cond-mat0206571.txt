    "the anderson quantum impurity model ( aim ) and its generalizations play a key role in several recent developments in the field of strongly correlated electron systems . in single - electron devices , it has been widely used as a simplified model for the competition between the coulomb blockade and the effect of tunnelling @xcite . in a different context , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) of strongly correlated electron systems replaces a spatially extended system by an anderson impurity model with a self - consistently determined bath of conduction electrons @xcite . naturally , the aim is also essential to our understanding of local moment formation in metals , and to that of heavy - fermion materials , particularly in the mixed valence regime @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to have at our disposal quantitative tools allowing for the calculation of physical quantities associated with the aim .",
    "the quantity of interest depends on the specific context .",
    "many recent applications require a calculation of the localized level green s function ( or spectral function ) , and possibly of some two - particle correlation functions .",
    "many such `` impurity solvers '' have been developed over the years .",
    "broadly speaking , these methods fall in two categories : numerical algorithms which attempt at a direct solution on the computer , and analytical approximation schemes ( which may also require some numerical implementation ) . among the former ,",
    "the quantum monte carlo approach ( based on the hirsch - fye algorithm ) and the numerical renormalization group play a prominent role .",
    "however , such methods become increasingly costly as the complexity of the model increases . in particular , the rapidly developing field of applications of dmft to electronic structure calculations @xcite requires methods that can handle impurity models involving orbital degeneracy . for example , materials involving f - electrons are a real challenge to dmft calculations when using quantum monte carlo . similarly",
    ", cluster extensions of dmft require to handle a large number of correlated local degrees of freedom .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of these local degrees of freedom , and this is a severe limitation to all methods , particularly exact diagonalization and numerical renormalization group .    the development of fast and accurate ( although approximate ) impurity solvers is therefore essential . in the one - orbital case ,",
    "the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) approximation @xcite has played a key role in the development of dmft , particularly in elucidating the nature of the mott transition @xcite .",
    "a key reason for the success of this method is that it becomes exact both in the limit of weak interactions , and in the atomic limit .",
    "unfortunately however , extensions of this approach to the multi - orbital case have not been as successful @xcite .",
    "another widely employed method is the non - crossing approximation , or nca @xcite .",
    "this method takes the atomic limit as a starting point , and performs a self - consistent resummation of the perturbation theory in the hybridization to the conduction bath .",
    "it is thus intrinsically a strong - coupling approach , and indeed it is in the strong - coupling regime that the nca has been most successfully applied .",
    "the nca does suffer from some limitations however , which can become severe for some specific applications .",
    "these limitations are of two kinds :    * the low - energy behaviour of nca integral equations is well - known to display non - fermi liquid power laws .",
    "this can be better understood when formulating the nca approach in terms of slave bosons @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear then that the nca actually describes accurately the overscreened regime of multichannel models .",
    "this is in a sense a remarkable success of nca , but also calls for some care when applying the nca to fermi - liquid systems in the screened regime .",
    "it must be noted that recent progresses have been made to improve the low - energy behaviour in the fermi liquid case @xcite . *",
    "a more important limitation for practical applications has to do with the finite-@xmath0 extensions of nca equations .",
    "standard extensions do not reproduce correctly the non - interacting @xmath1 limit .",
    "in contrast to ipt , they are not `` interpolative solvers '' between the weak - coupling and the strong coupling limit .",
    "furthermore , the physical self - energy tends to develop non - causal behaviour at low - frequency ( _ i.e. _ @xmath2 ) below some temperature ( the `` nca pathology '' ) at half - filling and large @xmath0 , this only happens at a rather low - energy scale , but away from half - filling or for smaller @xmath0 , this scale can become comparable to the bandwith , making the finite-@xmath0 nca of limited applicability .    in this article , we introduce new impurity solvers which overcome some of these difficulties . our method is based on a rather general representation of strongly correlated electron systems , which has potential applications to lattice models as well @xcite .",
    "the general idea is to introduce a new slave - particle representation of physical electron operators , which emphasizes the _ phase variable dual to the total charge _ on the impurity .",
    "this should be contrasted to slave - boson approaches to a multi - orbital aim : there , one introduces as many auxiliary bosons as there are fermion states in the local hilbert space .",
    "this is far from economical : when the local interaction depends on the total charge only , it should be possible to identify a collective variable which provides a minimal set of collective slave fields .",
    "we propose that the phase dual to the total charge precisely plays this role .",
    "this turns a correlated electron model ( at finite @xmath0 ) into a model of spin- ( and orbital- ) carrying fermions coupled to a _",
    "quantum rotor degree of freedom_. various types of approximations can then be made on this model . in this article , we emphasize an approximate treatment based on a sigma - model representation of the rotor degree of freedom , which is then solved in the limit of a large number of components .",
    "this results in coupled integral equations which share some similarities to those of the nca , but do provide the following improvements :    * the non - interacting ( @xmath1 ) limit is reproduced exactly . for a fully symmetric multi - orbital model at half - filling and in the low temperature range , the atomic limit is also captured exactly , so that the proposed impurity solver is an interpolative scheme between weak and strong coupling .",
    "the sigma - model approximation does not treat as nicely the atomic limit far from half - filling however ( though improvements are possible , see section [ sec : doping ] ) .",
    "* the physical self - energy does not display any violation of causality ( even at low temperature or small @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is guaranteed by the fact that our integral equations become exact in the formal limit of a large number of orbitals and components of the sigma - model field .",
    "it should be emphasized , though , that the low - energy behaviour of our equations is similar to the ( infinite-@xmath0 ) nca , and characterized by non - fermi liquid power laws below some low - energy scale .",
    "as a testing ground for the new solver , we apply it in this paper to the dmft treatment of the mott transition in the multi - orbital hubbard model .",
    "we find an overall very good agreement with the general aspects of this problem , as known from numerical work and from some recently derived exact results .",
    "we also compare to other impurity solvers ( ipt , exact diagonalization , qmc , nca ) , particularly regarding the one - electron spectral function .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : rotor ] , we introduce a representation of fermion operators in terms of the phase variable dual to the total charge ( taking the finite @xmath0 , multi - orbital anderson impurity model as an example ) . in section [ sec : nca ] , a sigma - model representation of this phase variable is introduced , along with a generalization from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . in the limit of a large number of components , a set of coupled integral equations",
    "is derived . in section [ sec : siam ] , we test this `` dynamical slave rotor '' ( dsr ) approach on the single - impurity anderson model . the rest of the paper ( sec .  [",
    "sec : dmft ] ) is devoted to applications of this approach in the context of dmft , which puts in perspective the advantages and limitations of the new method .",
    "the present article emphasizes the role played by the total electron charge , and its conjugate phase variable .",
    "we introduce a representation of the physical electron in terms of two auxiliary fields : a fermion field which carries spin ( and orbital ) degrees of freedom , and the ( total ) charge raising and lowering operators which we represent in terms of a phase degree of freedom .",
    "the latter plays a role similar to a slave boson : here a `` slave '' @xmath3 quantum rotor is used rather than a conventional bosonic field .",
    "we first explain this construction on the simple example of an atomic problem , consisting in an @xmath5-fold degenerate atomic level subject to a local @xmath6-symmetric coulomb repulsion : @xmath7 ^ 2\\ ] ] we use here @xmath8 as a convenient redefinition of the impurity level , and we recast the spin and orbital degrees of freedom into a single index @xmath9 ( for @xmath10 , we have a single orbital with two possible spin states @xmath11 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath12 is zero at half filling , due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the crucial point is that the spectrum of the atomic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hlocal ] ) depends only on the total fermionic charge @xmath13 and has a simple quadratic dependence on @xmath14 : @xmath15 ^ 2\\ ] ] there are @xmath16 states , but only @xmath17 different energy levels , with degeneracies @xmath18 . in conventional slave boson methods",
    "@xcite , a bosonic field is introduced for each atomic state @xmath19 ( along with spin - carrying auxiliary fermions @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence , these methods are not describing the atomic spectrum in a very economical manner .    the spectrum of ( [ eq : hlocal ] )",
    "can actually be reproduced by introducing , besides the set of auxiliary fermions @xmath20 , a single additional variable , namely the angular momentum @xmath21 associated with a quantum @xmath3 rotor @xmath22 ( _ i.e. _ an angular variable in @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the energy levels ( [ eq : atomic_spectrum ] ) can be obtained using the following hamiltonian @xmath24 a constraint must be imposed , which insures that the total number of fermions is equal to the @xmath3 angular momentum ( up to a shift ) : @xmath25\\ ] ] this restricts the allowed values of the angular momentum to be @xmath26 , while in the absence of any constraint @xmath27 can be an arbitrary ( positive or negative ) integer .",
    "the spectrum of ( [ eq : hloc_f_theta ] ) is @xmath28 , with @xmath29 thanks to ( [ eq : contrainte ] ) , so that it coincides with ( [ eq : atomic_spectrum ] ) .    to be complete",
    ", we must show that each state in the hilbert space can be constructed in terms of these auxiliary degrees of freedom , in a way compatible with the pauli principle .",
    "this is achieved by the following identification : @xmath30 in which @xmath31 denotes the antisymmetric fermion state built out of @xmath32 and @xmath33 fermions , respectively , and @xmath34 denotes the quantum rotor eigenstate with angular momentum @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 .",
    "the creation of a physical electron with spin @xmath36 corresponds to acting on such a state with @xmath20 as well as raising the total charge ( angular momentum ) by one unit .",
    "since the raising operator is @xmath37 , this leads to the representation : @xmath38 let us illustrate this for @xmath10 by writing the four possible states in the form : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and showing that this structure is preserved by @xmath43 . indeed",
    ": @xmath44 the key advantage of the quantum rotor representation is that the original quartic interaction between fermions has been replaced in ( [ eq : hloc_f_theta ] ) by a simple kinetic term ( @xmath45 ) for the phase field .",
    "we now turn to an @xmath6-symmetric anderson impurity model in which the atomic orbital is coupled to a conduction electron bath : @xmath46 ^ 2\\\\ \\nonumber &   & + \\sum_{k,{\\sigma } } \\epsilon_k c^\\dagger_{k,{\\sigma } } c_{k,{\\sigma } }   + \\sum_{k,{\\sigma } } v_k \\left ( c^\\dagger_{k,{\\sigma } } { d_{\\sigma}}+ { d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}}c_{k,{\\sigma } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the representation ( [ eq : repres ] ) , we can rewrite this hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath47 fields only : @xmath48 we then set up a functional integral formalism for the @xmath20 and @xmath22 degrees of freedom , and derive the action associated with ( [ eq : hinit ] ) .",
    "this is simply done by switching from phase and angular - momentum _ operators _ @xmath49 to _ fields _ @xmath50 depending on imaginary time @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the action is constructed from @xmath52 $ ] , and an integration over @xmath53 is performed .",
    "it is also necessary to introduce a complex lagrange multiplier @xmath54 in order to implement the constraint @xmath55 .",
    "we note that , because of the charge conservation on the local impurity , @xmath54 can be chosen to be independent of time , with @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the following expression of the action : @xmath57\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can recast this formula in a more compact form by introducing the hybridization function : @xmath58 and integrating out the conduction electron bath .",
    "this leads to the final form of the action of the @xmath6 anderson impurity model in terms of the auxiliary fermions and phase field : @xmath59      in this section , we present an alternative derivation of the expression ( [ eq : action2 ] ) of the action which does not rely on the concept of slave particles .",
    "this has the merit to give a more explicit interpretation of the phase variable introduced above , by relating it to a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling field .",
    "this section is however not essential to the rest of the paper , and can be skipped upon first reading .",
    "let us start with the imaginary time action of the anderson impurity model in terms of the physical electron field for the impurity orbital : @xmath60 ^ 2 \\\\ & \\!\\!+ & \\!\\!\\!\\!{\\int_0^\\beta \\!\\!\\!\\ !",
    "! d\\tau } ' \\delta(\\tau\\!-\\!\\tau ' ) \\sum_{{\\sigma } } { d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}}(\\tau ) { d_{\\sigma}}(\\tau')\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because we have chosen a @xmath6-symmetric form for the coulomb interaction , we can decouple it with only one bosonic hubbard - stratonovitch field @xmath61 : @xmath62 hence , a linear coupling of the field @xmath61 to the fermions has been introduced .",
    "the idea is now to eliminate this linear coupling for all the fourier modes of the @xmath63-field , except that corresponding to zero - frequency : @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "this can be achieved by performing the following gauge transformation : @xmath65 the reason for the second phase factor in this expression is that it guarantees that the new fermion field @xmath20 also obeys antiperiodic boundary conditions in the path integral .",
    "it is easy to check that this change of variables does not provide any jacobian , so that the action simply reads : @xmath66 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now set : @xmath67\\right)\\ ] ] and notice that the field @xmath68 has the boundary condition @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "it therefore corresponds to an @xmath3 quantum rotor , and the expression of the action finally reads : @xmath70 this is exactly expression ( [ eq : action2 ] ) , with the identification : @xmath71 .",
    "this , together with ( [ eq : int_theta ] ) , provides an explicit relation between the quantum rotor and lagrange multiplier fields on one side , and the hubbard - stratonovich field conjugate to the total charge , on the other .",
    "instead of using a phase field to represent the @xmath3 degree of freedom , one can use a constrained ( complex ) bosonic field @xmath72 with : @xmath73 the action ( [ eq : action2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of this field , provided a lagrange multiplier field @xmath74 is used to implement this constraint : @xmath75 hence , the anderson model has been written as a theory of auxiliary fermions coupled to a non - linear @xmath3 sigma - model , with a constraint ( implemented by @xmath54 ) relating the fermions and the sigma - model field @xmath76 .    a widely - used limit in which sigma models become solvable , is the limit of a large number of components of the field .",
    "this motivates us to generalize ( [ eq : action_de_phase ] ) to a model with an @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the bosonic field @xmath77 is thus extended to an @xmath78-component complex field @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) with @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding action reads : @xmath82 let us note that this action corresponds to the hamiltonian : @xmath83    in this expression , @xmath84 denotes the angular momentum tensor associated with the @xmath79 vector .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : anderson_om ] ) is a generalization of the @xmath85 anderson impurity model to an @xmath86 model in which the total electronic charge is associated with a specific component of @xmath53 .",
    "it reduces to the usual anderson model for @xmath87 .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the limit where both @xmath5 and @xmath78 become large , while keeping a fixed ratio @xmath88 .",
    "we shall demonstrate that exact coupled integral equations can be derived in this limit , which determine the green s functions of the fermionic and sigma - model fields ( and the physical electron green s function as well ) .",
    "the fact that these coupled integral equations do correspond to the exact solution of a well - defined hamiltonian model ( eq .  ( [ eq : anderson_om ] ) ) guarantees that no unphysical features ( like e.g violation of causality ) arise in the solution .",
    "naturally , the generalized hamiltonian ( [ eq : anderson_om ] ) is a formal extension of the anderson impurity model of physical interest .",
    "extending the charge symmetry from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is not entirely inocuous , even at the atomic level : as we shall see below , the energy levels of a single @xmath4 quantum rotor have multiple degeneracies , and depend on the charge ( angular momentum ) quantum number in a way which does not faithfully mimic the @xmath3 case",
    ". nevertheless , the basic features defining the generalized model ( a localized orbital subject to a coulomb charging energy and coupled to an electron bath by hybridization ) are similar to the original model of physical interest .      in this section ,",
    "we derive coupled integral equations which become exact in the limit where _ both _ @xmath78 and @xmath5 are large with a fixed ratio : @xmath89 following @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the two body interaction between the auxiliary fermions and the sigma - model fields is decoupled using ( bosonic ) bi - local fields @xmath90 and @xmath91 depending on two times . hence , we consider the action : @xmath92 in the limit ( [ eq : limit ] ) , this action is controlled by a saddle - point , at which the lagrange multipliers take static expectation values @xmath54 and @xmath93 , while the saddle point values of the @xmath14 and @xmath94 fields are translation invariant functions of time @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    introducing the imaginary - time green s functions of the auxiliary fermion and sigma - model fields as : @xmath97 we differentiate the effective action ( [ eq : actionlargenm ] ) with respect to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which leads to the following saddle - point equations : @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the functions @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) define fermionic and bosonic self - energies : @xmath106 where @xmath107 ( _ resp .",
    "_ @xmath108 ) is a fermionic ( _ resp . _",
    "bosonic ) matsubara frequency .",
    "the saddle point equations read : @xmath109 together with the constraints associated with @xmath54 and @xmath93 : @xmath110\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is a clear similarity between the structure of these coupled integral equations and the infinite-@xmath0 nca equations @xcite .",
    "we note also significant differences , such as the constraint equations .",
    "furthermore , the finite value of the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 enters the bosonic propagator ( [ eq : gx ] ) in a quite novel manner .",
    "the two key ingredients on which the present method are based is the use of a slave rotor representation of fermion operators , and the use of integral equations for the frequency - dependent self - energies and green s functions .",
    "for this reason , we shall denote the integral equations above under the name of `` dynamical slave rotor '' method ( dsr ) in the following .",
    "we make here some technical remarks concerning these integral equations .",
    "first , we clarify how the interaction parameter @xmath0 was scaled in order to obtain the dsr equations above .",
    "this issue is related to the manner in which the atomic limit ( @xmath111 ) is treated in this method . in the original @xmath3 atomic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hlocal ] )",
    ", the charge gap between the ground - state and the first excited state is @xmath112 at half - filling ( @xmath113 ) . in the dsr method , the charge gap is associated with the gap in the slave rotor spectrum .",
    "if the @xmath4 generalization of ( [ eq : hlocal ] ) is written as in ( [ eq : anderson_om ] ) : @xmath114 the spectrum reads : @xmath115 . as a result , the energy difference from the ground state to the first excited state is @xmath116 at large @xmath78 , whereas it is @xmath112 at @xmath87 .",
    "in order to use the dsr method in practice as an approximate impurity solver , the parameter @xmath0 should thus be normalized in a different way than in ( [ eq : anderson_om ] ) , so that the gap is kept equal to @xmath112 in the large - m limit as well .",
    "technically this can be enforced by choosing the following normalization : @xmath117 instead of ( [ eq : rotor_om ] ) .",
    "note that this scaling coincides with ( [ eq : rotor_om ] ) for @xmath87 , but does yield @xmath118 for large - m , as desired .",
    "this definition of @xmath0 was actually used when writing the saddle - point integral equations ( [ eq : gx ] ) , although we postponed the discussion of this point to the present section for reasons of simplicity .",
    "let us elaborate further on the accuracy of the dsr integral equations in the atomic limit . in appendix  [ app :",
    "atomic ] , we show that the physical electron spectral function obtained within dsr in the atomic limit coincides with the exact @xmath3 result at half - filling and at @xmath119 .",
    "this is a non - trivial result , given the fact that the constraint is treated on average and the above remark on the spectrum spectrum .",
    "in contrast to nca , the dsr method ( in its present form ) is not based by construction on a strong - coupling expansion around the exact atomic spectrum , so that this is a crucial check for the applicability of this method in practice . in the context of dmft for example ,",
    "it is essential in order to describe correctly the mott insulating state @xcite .",
    "however , the dsr integral equations fail to reproduce exactly the o(2 ) atomic limit off half - filling , as explained in appendix  [ app : atomic ] .",
    "deviations become severe for too high dopings , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : doping ] .",
    "this makes the present form of dsr applicable only for systems in the vicinity of half - filling .",
    "we now discuss some general spectral properties of the dsr solver . from the representation of the physical electron field @xmath120 , and from the convention chosen for the pseudo - particules green s functions ( [ eq : gfdef]-[eq : gxdef ] ) , the one - electron physical green s function is simply expressed as : @xmath121 therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : col3 ] ) , combined with the fact that @xmath20 has a @xmath122 discontinuity at @xmath123 ( which is obvious from ( [ eq : gf ] ) ) , shows that @xmath124 possesses also a @xmath122 jump at zero imaginary time .",
    "this ensures that the physical spectral weight is unity in our theory , and thus that physical spectral function are correctly normalized .",
    "because the dsr integral equations result from a controlled large @xmath125 limit , it also insures that the physical self - energy always have the correct sign ( _ i.e. _ @xmath126 ) .",
    "this is _ not _ the case @xcite for the finite @xmath0 version of the nca @xcite which is constructed as a resummation of the strong - coupling expansion in the hybridization function @xmath127 ( strong coupling resummations generically suffer from non - causality , see also @xcite for an illustration . )    finally , we comment on the non - interacting limit @xmath128 .",
    "this is a major failure of the usual nca , which limits its applicability in the weakly correlated regime . in the dsr formalism",
    ", this limit is _ exact _ as can be noticed from equation ( [ eq : gx ] ) .",
    "indeed , as @xmath0 vanishes , only the zero - frequency component of @xmath129 survives , so that @xmath130 simply becomes a constant .",
    "because of the constraint ( [ eq : col3 ] ) , we get correctly @xmath131 at @xmath1 . from ( [ eq : col2 ] ) and ( [ eq : green ] ) , this proves that @xmath132 is the non - interacting green s function : @xmath133    we finally acknowledge that an alternative dynamical approximation to the finite @xmath0 anderson model @xcite was recently developed as an extension of nca by kroha , wlfle and collaborators ( a conventional slave boson representation was used in this work ) .",
    "many progresses have been made following this method , but , to the authors knowledge , this technique has not yet been implemented in the context of dmft ( one of the reasons is its computational cost ) . by developing the dsr approximation",
    ", we pursue a rather complementary goal : the aim here is not to improve the low - energy singularities usually encountered with integral equations , but rather to have a fast and efficient solver which reproduces correctly the main features of the spectral functions and interpolates between weak and strong coupling . in that sense , it is very well adapted to the dmft context .",
    "we now discuss the application of the dsr in the simplest setting : that of a single impurity hybridized with a fixed bath of conduction electrons . for simplicity , we focus on the half - filled , particle - hole symmetric case , which implies @xmath134",
    ". the doped ( or mixed valence ) case will be addressed in the next section , in the context of dmft .    as the strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath0",
    "is increased from weak to strong coupling , two well - known effects are expected ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "first the width of the low - energy resonance is reduced from its non - interacting value @xmath135 .",
    "as one enters the kondo regime @xmath136 ( with @xmath137 the conduction electrons bandwidth ) , this width becomes a very small energy scale , of the order of the kondo temperature : @xmath138 a ( local ) fermi liquid description applies , with quasiparticles having a large effective mass and small weight : @xmath139 .",
    "the impurity spin is screened for @xmath140 .",
    "second , the corresponding spectral weight is transferred to high energies , into `` hubbard bands '' associated to the atomic - like transitions ( adding or removing an electron into the half - filled impurity orbital ) , broadened by the hybridization to the conduction electron bath .",
    "the suppression of the low - energy spectral weight corresponds to the suppression of the charge fluctuations on the local orbital .",
    "these satellites are already visible at moderate values of the coupling @xmath141 . as temperature is increased from @xmath140 to @xmath142 , the kondo quasiparticle resonance",
    "is quickly destroyed , and the missing spectral weight is added to the hubbard bands .    the aim of this section is to investigate whether the integral equations introduced in this paper reproduce these physical effects in a satisfactory manner .",
    "we have solved numerically these integral equations by iteration , both on the imaginary axis and for real frequencies .",
    "working on the imaginary axis is technically much easier .",
    "a discretization of the interval @xmath143 $ ] is used ( with typically 8192 points , and up to 32768 for reaching the lowest temperatures ) , as well as fast fourier transforms for the green s functions .",
    "searching by dichotomy for the saddle - point value of the lagrange multiplier @xmath93 ( eq .  [ eq : col3 ] ) is conveniently implemented at each step of the iterative procedure .",

    "[ fig : pousse_kondo ] , we display our results for the impurity - orbital spectral function @xmath147 , at three different temperatures ( the density of states of the conduction electron bath is chosen as a semi - circle with half - width @xmath148 , the resonant level width is @xmath149 and we take @xmath145 ) .",
    "the growth of the kondo resonance as the temperature is lowered is clearly seen .",
    "the temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig : pousse_kondo ] have been chosen such as to illustrate three different regimes : for @xmath150 , no resonance is seen and the spectral density displays a `` pseudogap '' separating the two high - energy bands ; for @xmath151 transfer of spectral weight to low energy is seen , resulting in a fully developed kondo resonance for @xmath152 .",
    "we have not obtained an analytical determination of the kondo temperature within the present scheme . in the case of nca equations , it is possible to derive a set of differential equations in the limit of infinite bandwith which greatly facilitate this .",

    "@xmath78 channels of conduction electrons_. hence , the non - fermi liquid behaviour found when solving the integral equations associated with the @xmath181 limit simply follows from the fact that multi - channel models lead to _ overscreening _ of the impurity spin , and correspond to a non - fermi liquid fixed point . in that sense , these integral equations reproduce very accurately the expected low - energy physics , as previously studied for the simplest case of the kondo model in @xcite .",
    "naturally , this means that the use of such integral equations to describe the one - channel ( exactly screened ) case becomes problematic in the low - energy region .",
    "in particular , the exact friedel sum rule is violated , the d - level lifetime remains finite at low energy and non - fermi liquid singularities are found . while the approach is reasonable in order to reproduce the overall features of the one - electron spectra , it should not be employed to calculate transport properties at low energy for example .",
    "we note however that the deviation from the exact friedel sum rule vanishes in the @xmath182 limit .",
    "this is expected from the fact that in this limit the number of channels ( @xmath78 ) is small as compared to orbital degeneracy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the violation of the sum rule remains rather small even for reasonable values of @xmath175 .",
    "this parameter can actually be used as an adjustable parameter when using the present method as an approximate impurity solver .",
    "there is no fundamental reason for which @xmath183 should provide the best approximate description of the spectral functions of the one - channel case .",
    "we shall use this possibility when applying this method in the dmft context in the next section : there , we choose @xmath184 in order to adjust to the known critical value of @xmath0 for a single orbital .",
    "we also used this value in the calculations reported above .",
    "the zero - frequency value of the spectral density is thus @xmath185 , while the friedel sum rule would yield @xmath186 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : analyse_tk ] ) .",
    "hence the violation of the sum rule is a small effect ( of the order of @xmath187 ) , comparable to the one found with `` numerically exact '' solvers , due to discretization errors @xcite . also , we point out that the pinning of @xmath169 at a value independent of @xmath0 ( albeit not that of the friedel sum - rule ) is an important aspect of the present method , which will prove to be crucial in the context of dmft in order to recover the correct scenario for the mott transition .",

    "it is crucial for an approximate solver to reproduce this separation of energy scales in order to yield a correct description of the mott transition and phase diagram .",

    "the algorithm is looped back using the dyson equations ( for real frequency ) : @xmath262    at each iteration , @xmath93 and @xmath54 are determined using a bisection on the equations ( [ eq : col3]-[eq : col4 ] ) , which can be properly expressed in terms of retarded green s functions : @xmath263 where @xmath234 , the average number of physical fermions , is : @xmath264    we note here that solving these real - time integral equations can be quite difficult deep in the kondo regime of the anderson model , or very close to the mott transition for the full dmft equations .",
    "the reason is that @xmath265 and @xmath266 develop low energy singularities ( this is analytically shown in the next appendix ) , that make the numerical resolution very unprecise if one uses fft . in that case , it is necessary to introduce a logarithmic mesh of frequency ( loosing the benefit of the fft speed , but increasing the accuracy ) , or to perform a pad extrapolation of the imaginary time solution .",
    "we present here for completeness the derivation of the slave rotor friedel s sum rule , equation ( [ eq : friedel ] ) , at half - filling .",
    "the idea , motivated by the numerical analysis as well as theoretical arguments @xcite , is that the pseudo - particles develop low frequency singularities at zero temperature : @xmath267 using the spectral representation @xmath268 we deduce the long time behavior of the green s functions ( we denote by @xmath269 the gamma function ) : @xmath270 we have similarly @xmath271 if one assumes a regular bath density of states at zero frequency .",
    "the previous expressions allow to extract the long time behavior of the pseudo - self - energies ( using the saddle - point equations ( [ eq : col1]-[eq : col2 ] ) ) : @xmath272 the next step is to use ( [ eq : repr ] ) the other way around to get from ( [ eq : sxw]-[eq : sfw ] ) the @xmath273-dependance of the self - energies : @xmath274 it is necessary at this point to calculate the real part of both self - energies .",
    "this can be done using the kramers - kronig relation , but analyticity provides a simpler route .",
    "indeed , by noticing that @xmath275 is an analytic function of @xmath276 and must be uni - valuated above the real axis , we find : @xmath277 } |z|^{1-\\alpha_f}\\\\ \\nonumber \\sigma_f(z ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\frac{a_x \\delta''(0)}{1-\\alpha_x } \\frac{e^{i\\alpha_x\\pi/2}}{\\sin[\\alpha_x\\pi/2 ] } |z|^{1-\\alpha_x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we can therefore collect the previous expressions , using dyson s formula for complex argument : @xmath279 and this enables us to extract the leading exponents , as well as the product of the amplitudes : @xmath280      this proves ( [ eq : friedel ] ) . in principle , next leading order corrections can be computed by the same line of arguments , although this is much more involved @xcite .",
