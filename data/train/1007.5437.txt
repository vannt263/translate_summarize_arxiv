    "the model of a two - level system coupled to a quantized oscillator experiences widespread application in many different fields of physics . in quantum optics",
    "it describes the interaction of light with matter  of an atom coupled to the electromagnetic mode of a cavity .",
    "most interesting in this instance is the regime of strong coupling ; i.e. , the coupling strength @xmath2 between the atom and the cavity mode exceeds the loss rates stemming from spurious processes like escape through the cavity mirrors , relaxation to other atomic levels or into different photon modes , or decay due to fluctuations in the qubit control parameter induced by the environment . under this condition ,",
    "the atom and the cavity can repeatedly exchange excitations before decoherence takes over .",
    "the resulting rabi oscillations have been observed experimentally and the field is known today as cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite . but also",
    "for artificial atoms , like superconducting qubits @xcite , similar setups have been realized with the cavity being formed by a one - dimensional transmission line resonator @xcite or a simple @xmath3-circuit @xcite . in both cases",
    "the rabi splitting in the qubit - oscillator spectrum could be detected @xcite , while in the experiment of johansson et al .",
    "@xcite coherent vacuum rabi oscillations were observed .",
    "the advantages of this field , known as circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , are manifold : for instance , the transition dipole moment of a superconducting cooper - pair box can be made up to four orders of magnitude larger than in real atoms . using a coplanar waveguide as cavity",
    ", the volume can be confined very tightly in the transverse directions only limited by the qubit size , which can be made much smaller than the resonator wavelength .",
    "thus , we can speak of a quasi-1d cavity , which leads to a strongly enhanced electric field @xcite and the strong coupling limit is more easily reached . in the first realization of wallraff",
    "@xcite a coupling strength of @xmath4 was observed , while in more recent experiments couplings up to a few percent , @xmath5 , were reported @xcite , reaching the upper limit possible for electric dipole coupling @xcite , whereas in cavity qed one finds typically @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the artificial atom can be placed at a fixed location in the cavity , so that fluctuations in the coupling strength are avoided .",
    "furthermore , fabrication techniques known from integrated circuits can be used to `` wire - up '' the qubit cavity system and connect it to other circuit elements @xcite . for investigations on the qubit - oscillator setup , the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite",
    "is usually invoked .",
    "it relies on a rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , which is valid for not too strong coupling @xmath7 and weak detuning , @xmath8 , where the qubit transition frequency @xmath9 equals the tunneling matrix element @xmath1 for zero static bias @xmath10 .",
    "however , for certain experimental conditions , coupling strengths of more than a few percent or even unity were predicted reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite . for those strong couplings , the application of a rotating - wave approximation and",
    "thus the jcm is _ not _ justified anymore .",
    "for instance , quite recently an experiment by niemczyk et al .",
    "@xcite could show the failure of the jcm for a josephson flux - qubit placed inside the center conductor of an inhomogeneous transmission - line resonator . also for a flux - qubit coupled to an @xmath3-circuit",
    ", the break - down of the rotating wave approximation has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite and the ultrastrong coupling regime seems to be in close reach @xcite . while in the jcm the ground state of the qubit - oscillator system consists of a product of the qubit s ground state and the oscillator s vacuum state , an inclusion of the counter - rotating terms leads to  depending on the coupling strength  an entangled or a squeezed vacuum state containing virtual photons @xcite , which under abrupt switch - off of the coupling are emitted as correlated photon pairs , reminding of the dynamical casimir effect @xcite .",
    "such an adiabatic manipulation has been recently realized experimentally for intersubband cavity polaritons in semiconducting quantum wells @xcite . in this experiment and also in @xcite a dimensionless coupling strength of about 10% has been reached . furthermore , ultrastrong coupling has been predicted for qubits coupled to nanomechanical resonators @xcite.theories examining the qubit - oscillator system going beyond the rwa are at hand : the adiabatic approximation ( see @xcite and references therein ) relies on a polaron transformation and is derived under the assumption @xmath11 .",
    "it fails to return the limit of zero coupling @xmath12 , where the jcm works well .",
    "an improvement to this theory is given by the generalized rotating - wave approximation ( grwa ) @xcite , which is a combination of the adiabatic approximation and the standard rwa and works well in both regimes of zero and large qubit - oscillator detuning .",
    "further , it covers correctly the weak coupling limit .",
    "however , it has not been used yet to investigate the dynamics of the qubit - oscillator system .",
    "the niba calculations by nesi et al .",
    "@xcite treat analytically a two - level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator to all orders in the coupling strength @xmath2 , taking environmental influences into account .",
    "zueco et al .",
    "present a theory beyond the rotating - wave approximation in the strong dispersive regime @xcite . from these works",
    ", one can learn that the simple picture of the qubit - oscillator energy spectrum is not given by the jaynes - cummings ladder anymore , where pairs of energy levels which are degenerate for @xmath13 are split by @xmath14 , with @xmath15 denoting the higher oscillator level being involved .",
    "however , all these theories are derived for an unbiased qubit ( @xmath16 ) or in the terminology of cavity and circuit qed , for a qubit operated at the degeneracy point or sweet spot . while this situation is usually encountered for real atoms in cavity qed",
    ", it is quite straightforward to vary the static bias @xmath10 of superconducting qubits by an external control parameter like the gate voltage applied to a cooper - pair box or the magnetic flux acting on a josephson junction .",
    "indeed , such a detuning from the degeneracy point is performed in spectroscopic measurements of the qubit - oscillator system , see e.g. @xcite , or in a current - based read - out of the qubit @xcite .",
    "therefore , theories are necessary which treat the _ biased _ qubit - oscillator system in the ultrastrong coupling limit . in @xcite",
    "this is done for a qubit coupled to a linear or nonlinear oscillator , respectively , up to second order in the coupling strength @xmath2 .",
    "higher - order effects like the bloch - siegert shift of the qubit dynamics could be observed .",
    "brito et al . used in @xcite a slightly changed polaron transformation on the qubit - oscillator model and obtained by truncating the displaced harmonic oscillator to its first excited level an effective four - level model .",
    "quite recently , the adiabatic approximation for a high - frequency oscillator was reviewed for a biased system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the opposite regime of a high - frequency qubit has been examined there . in this work",
    ", we present a theory which takes the static bias of the qubit into account and treats the qubit - oscillator system to all orders in the coupling strength .",
    "we consider the qubit tunneling matrix element @xmath1 as a small perturbation .",
    "for zero static bias , our approach can be seen as an extension of the adiabatic approximation by taking into account higher order terms of @xmath1 using van vleck perturbation theory ( vvp ) . we do not only examine the energy levels of the system but also calculate corrections to the displaced qubit - oscillator states , which we obtain using a polaron transformation on the unperturbed ( @xmath17 ) case .",
    "unlike in the adiabatic approximation discussed in @xcite , we take the qubit s static bias into account while identifying degenerate subspaces , thereby adjusting the renormalized frequency already in the first order approach .",
    "our results work very well for negative detuning ( @xmath18 ) for the whole range of coupling strength and even exceeds in accuracy results obtained from the grwa for @xmath16 . for not too weak coupling @xmath19 and/or finite static bias",
    ", it agrees with numerical results even for the resonant case @xmath20 or positive detuning @xmath21 . with these observations we believe we can close the gaps which can not be treated by the jaynes - cummings model or the grwa . with our investigations",
    "we enter a new physical regime : the splitting between the energy levels does not scale linearly in @xmath2 anymore but depends through a dressing by laguerre polynomials on the coupling strength .",
    "this dependence allows for a suppression of individual frequency contributions to the dynamics .",
    "we further discover that even at low temperatures several frequencies come into play , while the jc dynamics is usually governed by two main oscillations.the outline of this work is as follows : after introducing the hamiltonian of the qubit - oscillator system in sec .",
    "[ sec::hamiltonian ] , we explain how it can be approximately diagonalized by a combination of displaced oscillator states and vvp .",

    "we examine the energy spectrum in detail in sec .",

    "[ sec::dynamics ] , we concentrate on the dynamics ; i.e. , we determine the time evolution of the population difference of the two - level system and test the adiabatic approximation and vvp again against numerics .",
    "we conclude our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec::conclusion ] .",
    "the predominant model to describe the interaction between an atom and the field of a cavity is the two - level - oscillator hamiltonian , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xmath22 the atom is described as a simple two - level system ( tls ) , @xmath23 where we use as basis the so - called localized states , which are eigenstates of the @xmath24 pauli matrix , @xmath25 .",
    "tunneling between the two states is taken into account by @xmath26 , throughout this work . ] and @xmath10 describes a possible static bias of the tls . in cavity qed setups",
    "one typically finds the situation of zero static bias , while in circuit qed @xmath10 can be controlled in situ .",
    "the atom is connected to the field of the cavity via a dipole coupling , which is expressed by @xmath27 the coupling strength is given by @xmath2 , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the raising and lowering operators of the field .",
    "as usual , we assume that this field can be expressed by a single harmonic oscillator mode of frequency @xmath30 , @xmath31 where we neglected the zero - point energy . despite its simplicity , this hamiltonian can not be diagonalized analytically , and several approximation schemes have been developed .",
    "the most famous one is the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , which neglects `` energy non - conserving '' or counter - rotating terms , and is restricted to relatively weak coupling strengths @xmath7 , where @xmath9 , and to systems close to resonance , @xmath8 .",
    "a natural extension to the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) is given in @xcite , where the counter - rotating terms in the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) are taken into account by using vvp to second order in the qubit - oscillator coupling .",
    "this method thus works also for intermediate coupling strengths and biased qubits and is able to explain effects which go beyond the capabilities of the jcm like the bloch - siegert shift recently measured in @xcite .",
    "an approach which goes beyond the restriction of weak coupling is the `` adiabatic approximation in the displaced oscillator basis '' , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is derived for the limit @xmath11 and relies on a separation of timescales : in order to calculate the fast dynamics of the oscillator ( fast compared to the qubit ) , the part coming from the tls in eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) is neglected , so that one gets an effective hamiltonian for the oscillator reading @xmath32 thus , depending on the state of the qubit the oscillator is displaced in opposite directions , while not changing its energy for a fixed oscillator quantum @xmath15 , as its eigenenergies are given by @xmath33 @xcite . by reintroducing the qubit contribution this degeneracy is lifted .",
    "however , as long as @xmath34 , the doublet structure is conserved . for an unbiased system , as done in @xcite , the condition translates to @xmath35 and the tunneling matrix element @xmath1 can be treated as a small perturbation , in the end leading to an effective hamiltonian consisting of 2 by 2 blocks , with a renormalized frequency on the off - diagonal . as this special case",
    "is included in our calculation , we will describe it in more detail below .",
    "furthermore , the contrary regime of a high - frequency qubit @xmath36 has been treated in @xcite analytically for certain special cases .",
    "this situation is also partly contained in our formalism .      in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate how the full hamiltonian @xmath37 can be diagonalized perturbatively to second order in @xmath1 . for a vanishing tunneling element , @xmath17",
    ", the polaron - like transformation @xmath38 brings @xmath37 into a diagonal form .. for a flux - qubit this situation occurs for an applied external flux at which the qubit potential changes from a double - well to a single well , and thus the qubit eigenstates become delocalized . in our work , however , we do not aim at describing such a parameter regime . ]",
    "its eigenstates are @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the eigenstates of the qubit - oscillator system for @xmath41 and @xmath13 . for detailed expressions",
    "( [ app::delta0stateup ] ) and ( [ app::delta0statedown ] ) .",
    "they correspond to the displaced oscillator states used in @xcite , where the displacement depends on the qubit state .",

    "this dressing by laguerre polynomials becomes in the high photon limit , @xmath46 , and for finite @xmath47 a dressing by bessel functions , just like in the case of a classically driven tls @xcite . for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the unperturbed eigenstates",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are degenerate , so that we can identify a twofold degenerate subspace in the complete hilbert space of the problem .",
