    "the popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm is facing several challenges on small scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of spiral galaxies , especially rotation curves and fast - rotating bars , suggest that in observed galaxies dark matter halos are much less concentrated than predicted by cdm ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , although this conclusion is still controversial ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the number of satellite dwarf galaxies in the local group is much smaller than the number of subhalos in cdm simulations @xcite , @xcite , although the discrepancy may be explained by the astrophysics of star formation rather than by the physics of the dark matter particle @xcite .",
    "these tests of cdm are limited , however , by uncertainties in interpreting luminous tracers of the potential .",
    "gravitational lensing offers a different test that probes mass distributions directly .",
    "strong lensing by galaxies robustly determines the total mass in the inner 510 kpc of lens galaxies , which are predominantly elliptical galaxies .",
    "it also offers the possibility to detect small - scale mass concentrations in galaxy halos @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "lensing thus offers new tests of cdm that avoid dynamical uncertainties and extend the tests from spiral galaxies to ellipticals .",
    "i construct new models for lens statistics that include both stellar and dark matter components ( see @xcite for details ) . in principle , i take a cdm dark matter halo , add baryons , let the baryons condense into a galaxy , and use the adiabatic contraction formalism @xcite to compute how the dark matter distribution is modified by the baryons .",
    "in practice , i fix the stellar galaxies and use the models to place dark matter halos around them .",
    "the stellar components are treated as hernquist models for elliptical galaxies , normalized by observed galaxy luminosity functions @xcite , fundamental plane relations @xcite , and bruzual & charlot @xcite model mass - to - light ratios ( which are reliable for the old stellar components of elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "two free parameters apply to the dark matter halos .",
    "first , halos with the navarro , frenk & white @xcite dark matter profile are described by a concentration parameter .",
    "a halo s concentration is determined by its mass and redshift , but with a scatter of @xmath2 dex @xcite .",
    "i include the scatter and take the median concentration to be a free parameter .",
    "second , to relate the total , virial mass of the dark matter halo ( @xmath3 ) to the mass of the stellar component ( @xmath4 ) , i define the `` cooled mass fraction '' @xmath5 .",
    "i take the cooled mass fraction to be the second free parameter in the models , assuming only that it is smaller than the global baryon fraction , @xmath6 .",
    "lens statistics can be used to test the cdm models , because changes to galaxy dark matter halos affect the number of lenses and the distribution of lens image separations .",
    "figure  1a demonstrates the test by comparing the model predictions with the data from the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; e.g. , @xcite ) , which is the largest homogeneous survey for lenses . increasing the concentration of dark matter halos",
    "raises the amount of dark matter in the inner parts of galaxies , leading the models to predict more and larger lenses . because the stellar components of the galaxies are fixed , _ decreasing _ the cooled mass fraction _",
    "increases _ the amount of dark matter , again leading to more and larger lenses .     and cooled mass fraction @xmath7 are indicated in each panel . _",
    "( b , right ) _ confidence intervals in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "the hatched region is excluded at 95% confidence by the distribution of lens image separations , and the cross - hatched region is further excluded by the number of lenses .",
    "the shaded region at the top is excluded at 95% confidence by measurements of @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all results are shown for a cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "see @xcite for more discussion .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    using statistical tests to compare the models to the data leads to confidence intervals in the @xmath8 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "lensing requires the models to have low concentrations or high cooled mass fractions . adding the constraint on @xmath7 from the baryon content of the universe leaves only a small region of parameter space where the models are acceptable .",
    "fiducial cdm models predict a median concentration @xmath12 for galaxies ( indicated in fig .",
    "this value is allowed by lens statistics only if galaxies are nearly 100% efficient at cooling their baryons ( @xmath13 ) , which is implausible ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the constraints in fig .",
    "1b are conservative , because most of the systematic effects in the lensing analysis strengthen the lensing constraints ( see @xcite ) .",
    "changing the cosmology ( increasing @xmath14 ) has little effect on the lensing analysis but reduces the upper limit @xmath15 .    translating the constraints into enclosed mass",
    "leads to the conclusion that dark matter can account for no more than 33% of the mass within @xmath16 and 40% of the mass within @xmath17 ( 95% confidence limits on average mass fractions ) .",
    "note that these limits are for the mass in _ spheres _ , whereas lensing limits on the mass in _ cylinders _ indicate that dark matter halos are still important in ellipticals .",
    "the lensing limits are consistent with the mass estimates from dynamical analyses of nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite . by contrast , the cdm models predict dark matter mass fractions of @xmath18 inside @xmath16 if baryon cooling is 100% efficient , and even higher fractions for more reasonable cooling efficiencies .",
    "nearly all observed lenses have an even number of images ( usually two or four ) .",
    "lens theory , by contrast , predicts that each lens should have an additional `` odd '' image located near the center of the lens galaxy , although it is demagnified by high central density of the lens galaxy . at optical wavelengths an odd image",
    "would be swamped by light from the lens galaxy , but in a radio lens an odd image should be detectable .",
    "the lack of odd images in radio lenses thus places strong lower limits on the central densities of lens galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cdm model galaxies predict that @xmath19 of ( radio ) lenses should have detectable odd images , implying that the model densities are much too low on @xmath0 pc scales ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "steep central cusps ( @xmath20 with @xmath21 ) and/or central black holes can help suppress odd images , but for realistic parameter ranges neither offers an attractive solution .",
    "the lack of odd images in observed lenses thus remains a puzzle whose resolution will reveal interesting new constraints on the very inner parts of distant galaxies .",
    "one claimed problem with cdm is that the number of subhalos in cdm model galaxies is much larger than the number of satellite dwarf galaxies in the local group , which suggests that cdm overpredicts the amount of substructure in galaxy - mass halos @xcite , @xcite .",
    "two solutions have been proposed . on the one hand , changing the nature of the dark matter could reduce the power on small scales and eliminate the subtructure @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , astrophysical processes such as photoionization could inhibit star formation in low mass systems , meaning that the cdm subhalos exist but are dark @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxy surveys can not distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "tidal streams offer an alternate test , because they can be disrupted by encounters with subhalos @xcite , @xcite , but the observational evidence is not yet available .    lensing offers a better test by being directly sensitive to mass in subhalos .",
    "mass clumps in the lens galaxy introduce small - scale variations in the lensing potential that alter the flux ratios of the lensed images @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "dalal & kochanek @xcite show that the incidence of `` anomalous '' flux ratios in 4-image lenses requires that @xmath22 of the mass be in small clumps on the scale @xmath23@xmath24 , which is in good agreement with the amount of substructure predicted by cdm .",
    "in other words , lensing strongly supports the scenario in which many subhalos exist but lack stars , and opposes changes to the nature of the dark matter that eliminates substructure .    to complement statistical analyses like @xcite ,",
    "i have studied a single 4-image lens in detail using data at a variety of wavelengths to obtain constraints on individual mass clumps @xcite . in b1422 + 231 ,",
    "the optical a / c flux ratio is largely consistent with smooth lens models while the radio a / c flux ratio is not ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "simultaneously explaining the optical and radio flux ratios and the shape of the radio image requires a mass clump in front of image a. a highly concentrated , point mass clump must have a mass @xmath23@xmath25 , while a more extended isothermal sphere must have a mass @xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "this is the first measurement of a particular clump lying in a distant galaxy ( @xmath28 ) and detected by its mass .",
    "interestingly , there also appears to be a clump passing in front of image b , but this clump is probably just a star in the lens galaxy . in the future , detailed analyses of individual clumps as in b1422 + 231 will be combined with statistical analyses like @xcite to constrain not only the substructure mass fraction but also the masses , densities , and sizes of dark subhalos , and the substructure mass function .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "lens statistics imply that the dark matter densities in the inner parts of elliptical galaxies are lower than predicted by cdm , in agreement with the conclusion from dynamical analyses of spiral galaxies .",
    "the cdm paradigm must therefore be modified to reduce dark matter densities on kiloparsec scales .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed ranging from astrophysics ( disk bars that erase dark matter cusps @xcite ) to cosmology ( a tilted power spectrum @xcite ) to particle physics ( dark matter that is not collisionless and cold @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "lensing also implies that lens galaxies have high densities on small scales ( @xmath30 pc ) .",
    "the central densities of galaxies must be much higher than predicted in cdm model galaxies to explain the absence of central or `` odd '' images in observed lenses .",
    "the flux ratios in four - images lenses imply that a substantial fraction of the dark matter ( @xmath22 ) lies in small - scale clumps rather than a smooth halo component @xcite , and b1422 + 231 suggests that a typical clump mass is @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , while lensing supports other evidence that a mechanism is needed to reduce dark matter densities on kiloparcsec scales , it also suggests that the mechanism must _ not _ remove structure on small scales  which argues against changing the nature of the dark matter particle .",
