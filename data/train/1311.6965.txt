    "the basic biological mechanisms that underlies the functional links between astrocytes , leading to consecutive elevations in calcium signal@xcite .",
    "the predominant mechanism is mediated by atp , which activates metabotropic p2y receptors in the astrocytic membrane , leading to the formation of inositol-3-phosphate ( ip@xmath1 ) , which then signals to release calcium from the intracellular stores .",
    "calcium elevation in an astrocyte leads to further release of atp to the extracellular media , which quickly acts in receptors in the membrane of neighboring cells , leading to calcium elevations in those cells , which leads to a continuous cascade of ca@xmath0signal propagation .",
    "transfer of ip@xmath1 across gap - junctions ( connexins ) may also contribute for the calcium elevation@xcite , though in a minor degree@xcite .",
    "other recent studies have shown that intracellular ca@xmath0 oscillations are basically a form of correlated noise@xcite , which raises the question of stochasticity and reproducibility of the signal propagation and the corresponding network . while questions concerning the details of the propagating mechanisms remain an important matter of discussion@xcite , we are here interested in extracting insight from the inter - connectivity between cells by keeping track of ca@xmath0 signals .",

    "concentration is measured by the ratio @xmath2 between the radiation emitted at @xmath3 nm when cells are excited at @xmath4 nm over emission upon excitation at @xmath5 nm.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=43.0% ]    uncovering the functional connectivity of astrocytes in these networks provides a better understanding of the functionality of the astrocytic network itself , but also allows us to assess drug effects , not only at the single cell level , but also upon the spreading of the signal throughout the cellular tissue@xcite .",
    "such activity can be well characterized by measuring the concentration of calcium ions ( ca@xmath0 ) using noninvasive techniques of calcium imaging .",
    "one of the most popular of such techniques uses fluorescent dye indicators , which bind selectively to free ca@xmath0 ions , undergoing a conformational change and consequently a variation in its fluorescence excitation and/or emission properties when bounded to ca@xmath0 .",
    "these variations can be used to evaluate changes in intracellular ca@xmath0 concentration . here",
    "concentration is measured by the ratio @xmath2 between maximum amplitudes at @xmath4 and @xmath5 nm , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the evolution of ca@xmath0 concentration in each cell depends typically on the diffusion of the signaling molecules through the intercellular environment and on the direct connection from one astrocyte to its neighbors . while the former mechanism is slow , the latter is fast and dominates for measurement series with high sample rates .",
    "this study focuses on the latter case .",
    "therefore , the series of measurements of ca@xmath0 concentrations at each cellular location reflects the flow of ca@xmath0 , and consequently the propagation of this ion from each cell to the neighboring ones .",
    "it should be noted that the brightening front generated at each cell does not necessarily propagate radially to its neighbors , since the physical connections between neighboring cells are heterogeneously distributed , which introduces spatial inhomogeneities in the signal propagation@xcite .",
    "one possible way to model ca@xmath0signal propagation is through a bottom - up approach , where the kinetic constants of intracellular and intercellular signal pathways , the spatial distributions of connections and receptors in the tissue , and the relative importance of signal propagation mechanisms needs to be known and incorporated in a detailed mechanical simulation .",
    "however , this approach is quite cumbersome and case dependent .",
    "we argue , however , that the detailed physical structure of interconnected cells is not necessary to characterize the response of the interconnected tissue to a signal .",
    "for that one only needs to uncover the so - called functional connectivity between cells , which describes the synchronization patterns between the cells . while functional connectivity is at most loosely related to causal connectivity , it reflects the way the tissue as an interconnected structure of cells , responds to external stimuli , and how this functional network is changed when applying drugs .",
    "therefore , for our purposes , we focus here on the functional connectivity .",
    "similar approaches to assess the functional connectivity in biological systems have already been presented , e.g.  in islets of langerhans from mouse pancreas tissue slices@xcite .    from the mathematical perspective",
    ", we quantify the connectivity and causality of information flow between the cells as a weighted graph .",
    "a graph is a collection of nodes interconnecting through edges according to some specific rules @xcite .",
    "our aim here is mapping the complex interactions and temporal information flow patterns to a much simpler representation .",
    "the graph is completely characterized by a single matrix , the adjacency matrix , whose entries are the weights of the edges between nodes . in case of cellular tissues ,",
    "nodes represent the cells , and edges between them the functional connections between a respective pair of cells .    to reconstruct this graph we consider the paths connecting neighboring astrocytes in a confluent culture of astrocytes , used as a tissue model , analyzing the time series of ca@xmath0 concentration measurements observed at each astrocyte separately ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . from these experimentally measured synchronization patterns ,",
    "we employ the correlation measures between the ca@xmath0time series .",
    "standard algorithms exist for this problem , based in granger causality@xcite .",
    "however , although they can be adapted to suit multivariate non - stationary data series@xcite , these methodologies assume the existence of a random process with a certain level of stationarity and then apply spectral analysis , decomposing the data series into a certain number of uncorrelated components , each one corresponding to a given spectral frequency .    for our particular case where one has sets of externally stimulated signals that are typically pulse - like and with short time - delays between them , a different approach must be considered , as will become apparent below .    here",
    ", we show that these particular signals observed in signal propagation of astrocytic tissues can best be recovered by our simple and accurate procedure , which can also be applied for assessing the efficiency and irreversibility of drug infusion on the structure of the tissue , by studying signal propagation .",
    "this report is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : model ] by describing the general properties of the signal and then give a detailed account of our procedure . in particular",
    ", we argue that using the normalized covariance between astrocytes for specific time - lags enables one to quantify the connectivity of each pair of astrocytes .",
    "we then show that , for synthetic networks , our procedure is more efficient and accurate than standard algorithms such as granger causality in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the experimental setup and the data extracted from samples of living astrocyte tissues . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we extract the connectivity networks for each sample and for each stimulus , using our procedure , and afterward analyze the moments of the weight distribution found for each tissue sample to discuss the effect of two drugs on the connectivity structure and the signal propagation , and the variability of the results .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper giving also a brief description of how this method can be applied to drug tests . our auxiliary model for creating synthetic signal data",
    "is described in [ appendix : synth ] . the granger method and algorithm",
    "is briefly described in [ appendix : granger ] .",
    "a brief description of the common numerical features of the ca@xmath0cascade follows . a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in sec .  [",
    "sec : data ] .    in all experiments , cell 1 is externally stimulated 10 times , with @xmath6 m atp ( focally applied for @xmath7 ms ) , the 11th peak being induced by a supramaximal concentration of atp ( @xmath8 m ) to test the maximal activity of the cell .",
    "the ca@xmath0signal cascade is observed by measuring the intracellular ca@xmath0levels , cf .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] , through the radiation amplitude ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the measured temporal signals , cf .  fig .  [ fig2 ] , are a series of pulses , accompanied by an increasing trend , the latter not being of interest here .",
    "the signals are of similar shape , which is initially gaussian , before decaying with a slower - than exponential tail .",
    "the amplitudes , however , are widely varying . generally speaking , it can be observed in this example that the stimulated cell 1and also cell 4have more or less constant signal amplitude ratios , whereas the cells farther away from cell 1 exhibit lower amplitudes and less regular peak heights .",
    "the signals are all delayed with respect to cell 1 , although this crucial property is not visible at the resolution level provided by fig .",
    "this delay , specifically the delay in correlations related to it , is the cornerstone of our method of reconstructing the signal network .      following the experimental results , we propose a model to obtain the network of functional connectivity , i.  e.  the existence , direction and strength of network links between the network nodes , which are the cells , from the measured signal correlations .",
    "the result is then a network comparable to fig .",
    "[ fig3]a .",
    "we consider a number @xmath9 of cells from which the ca@xmath0 can be measured composing the time series @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 labeling time - steps . to derive",
    "the connectivity between a pair of cells , say @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we consider primarily how strong the corresponding signals , @xmath10 and @xmath15 , are correlated . since we are dealing with signal propagation , one must also consider a time - delay @xmath16 separating the two measures @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we assume that a proper choice of the value of @xmath16 may completely reproduce at cell @xmath14 the shape of the signal occurring previously in cell @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath18 for all times @xmath19 , modulo an attenuation factor . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the inverse of the sample rate taken for extracting the series of measurements composing the signal at steps @xmath21 , with @xmath22 indicating the total number of measurements .",
    "typically , the signal at one cell is not completely reproduced in another cell , since the signal propagation involves various mechanisms , such as gap junction transport and diffusion . to determine how strong the signals are correlated , we take their covariance with a time - delay @xmath16 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the average and standard deviation of signal @xmath10 respectively .",
    "this measure has the properties @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "nodes represent the cells ( blue bullets ) and edges represent their connections ( yellow arrows ) . *",
    "( b ) * the connections can be evaluated from the time series at each node using two different procedures : granger causality@xcite ( black arrows ) or our method ( red arrows ) . comparing the results with the synthetic network of astrocytes in ( a )",
    ", our method can be taken as better for this particular purpose ( see text and fig .  [ fig7 ] ) . *",
    "( c ) * particular cases of signal correlations , namely pearson coefficient equal to one , may represent different but equivalent signal propagation topologies.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the value of the covariance between the signals at two neighboring cells may vary depending on the type of stimulus applied at the source - cell . also ,",
    "when repeatedly applying the same stimulus to the same array of cells , signal propagation may be altered by aging or learning effects .",
    "one would also expect that the effect of drugs is reflected by the covariance , such that , when the covariance increases in absolute value , it could indicate an excitatory effect of the stimulus substance .",
    "or , when it decreases , it could reveal an inhibitory effect .",
    "we stress once more that , while it remains only a hypothesis that the strength of the connection between two cells can be ascertained from the covariance their functional connectivity is indeed reflected in the covariance : the larger the covariance between two signals is in absolute value , the stronger the connection between the functional behavior of the corresponding cells should be .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the covariance between two astrocytes in the sample showed in fig .",
    "depending on the value of the delay @xmath16 , the covariance between two series can be large ( close to @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) or small ( close to @xmath30 ) . the successive maxima shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] correspond to distinct stimuli .",
    "however , the covariance alone does not suffice for showing how strongly connected two astrocytes are .",
    "indeed , the covariance for different delays correspond to different interaction modes , rates and paths joining two cells . here , we focus in the `` first '' interaction mode , corresponding to the fastest path propagating the signal from the unique source - cell to each of the other cells in the tissue . we assume that detecting for instance a reversible or irreversible effect of a drug in the rapidity of these propagating paths is sufficient to determine the reversible or irreversible effect in the tissue .    to determine the fastest paths , the time - delay in eq.([eq : cov ] )",
    "must also be considered , specifically the smallest one that maximizes the covariance : the delay needed for characterizing the connection between astrocytes is the lowest delay for which a local maximum of the covariance is observed .",
    "this value will be referred to as @xmath31 , cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and the corresponding covariance is henceforth called @xmath32 .    ) between the two cells @xmath28 and @xmath33 , shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] , as a function of time - delay @xmath16 . here , @xmath34 is the time - window between successive stimuli .",
    "typically , during each @xmath34 period , the covariance decreases from a maximum value to a minimum .",
    "the value of @xmath35 giving the delay for which the covariance is maximized is the lowest time - lag corresponding to a relative maximum.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the time - delay @xmath31 in fact measures the typical time for the signal to propagate from astrocyte @xmath13 to astrocyte @xmath14 .",
    "notice that we do not consider the relative distances of the cells because , as mentioned in the introduction above , the medium in which the signals propagates is highly heterogeneous and therefore preferential and non - preferential pathways of signal propagation exist and the geometrical distance is not a suitable criterion for signal propagation velocity@xcite .    in the particular situation",
    "that a cell propagates its signal to two neighbors with neither delay nor dumping , the respective covariances are exactly one , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]c . in this case",
    "both situations drawn with blue and green arrows are equivalent and indistinguishable .",
    "either one , and only one , of them is known to connect the set of cells .",
    "if the delay @xmath31 that maximizes the covariance between two astrocytes is small , it means that they should be closely connected and the corresponding connection should be strong . if the time - delay is large compared to other pairs , the corresponding strength should be small compared to those other pairs .",
    "therefore , the weight of the connection is reasonably assumed to be proportional to the inverse of the delay @xmath31 .    combining all the considerations above",
    "we define the strength @xmath36 of the connection between astrocytes @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath37 where one unit in the denominator is added for convenience , to avoid singular behavior .",
    "notice that the weight @xmath36 , being the quotient between correlation of two signals and time , can be interpreted as a correlation flux , which in this case measures the causality  and not the strength  of the flow of information between cells .",
    "still , the weight value alone can not reveal the structure of _ single _ signals through the tissue , as we explain next .",
    "is indicated . in this example the optimum path between cells @xmath28 and @xmath38 is @xmath39 , because this path combines the least time cost ( @xmath40 ) and greatest number of edges ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "for the period when applying drug b one observes @xmath45 meaning that the functional structure is random .",

    "the same occurs for the experiments with drug a ( see text).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=24.0% ] ) . for the period",

    "[ tab2 ] we present a summary of the main results from fig .  [ fig10 ] , where `` @xmath30 '' indicates no statistical significance in a t - test ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "as one can see , both the flux and the strengthening are not affected by any of the drugs , while the variability is .",
    "however , differently from the amplitude , variability shows to be affected by drug b , being facilitatory and irreversible .",
    "drug a also shows a irreversible and facilitatory effect on the variability but curiously with some delay .",
    "this may indicate that the time for drug application , while being properly used when evaluating its effect in total signal amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) may be not long enough for other features of the tissue influencing the signal propagation , in this case the variability . such increase of the variability could be a sign that the structure supporting some robustness of signal propagation is permanently modified by each drug . the same facilitatory and irreversible effect on the sensitivity seems to also occur , but only for drug a. it deserves to be noted that in a completely random model of link creation in each time step @xmath34 , the variability would be peaked at a value of @xmath55 .",
    "this is not supported by our data , which is a strong indicator that the reconstructed network do not have overwhelmingly random character .    for these new properties",
    ", we may summarize the analysis in this section by stating that while drug a mainly affects sensitivity @xmath47 , drug b mainly affects variability @xmath49 .    comparing the variability @xmath49 with the amplitude one concludes that , at least for these two different properties and for the correlation measure , the effects of the drugs are of different nature .",
    "therefore , one should approach such drug effects in a more extended way to analyze not only its overall influence in one single property , such as the total amplitude of the signals , but also in a set of properties that combined , characterize the functional structure of the network .    finally , it is important to check wether the functional structure does not change randomly among the several experiments under the same conditions .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the one - step correlation @xmath56 for all three periods when testing drug a ( left ) and drug b ( right ) .",
    "if we imagine a simple binomial model in which functional connections between cells @xmath57 are randomly created in each step , i.e. @xmath58 , both correlations would be equal to @xmath59 .",
    "correlation values above @xmath59 indicate the presence of actual correlations and memory about previous correlations in the system . when applying drug b correlations approximate the uncorrelated regime @xmath60 . for both pre and post periods",
    "however , correlation deviates significantly from @xmath60 , evidencing a functional structure underlying the sequence of signals . for drug",
    "a this deviation is even stronger and it is further strengthened when applying the drug in a irreversible way ( check tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we introduce a procedure for extracting the functional connectivity network in living tissues subjected to external pulsed stimuli that propagate through it as a signal .",
    "our method is based on the covariance matrix of the separated signals taken at different time - lags . by adding proper constraints of a minimum time - delay between pairs of cells and single - source stimulus to each cell we are able to filter out all redundant or artificial connections from the covariance matrix .",
    "we test our procedure with synthetic data",
    ". there , our procedure proves to be better suited for assessing the connectivity of living tissues of astrocytic samples used than other standard measures , namely the multivariate granger causality algorithm .",
    "the better results of our procedure indicates that for the particular case of signal propagation networks with one single triggering source , standard methods may retrieve biased results .",
    "the weight ( strength ) of each connection is computed directly from the covariance matrix and the minimum delay - time .",
    "further , we showed how to obtain additional insight relative to the drug used for stimulating the source - cell only by analyzing the distribution of connectivity strengths ( weights ) . from the first , second and third moment of the weight distribution",
    "we showed how to characterize respectively the signal flux and also the sensitivity and strengthening of the network underlying the signal propagation in the tissue .",
    "we also characterized the temporal stability of the network by its variability and a correlation measure , and found these measures to complement the information from the signal amplitude ratios .",
    "following what was introduced in the beginning of our paper , it is important to stress here that our method is not able to uncover the physical connectivity structure between cells and that it is also not aimed for studying particular features of the signal itself , such as the measurement noise@xcite . while our method works for pulsed signals similar to the ones measured in the samples shown in fig .",
    "[ figappend ] , as explained in [ appendix : synth ] , and the variability already reflects implicitly the impact of measurement noise in the sample of signals , it would be interesting to extend this methodology further to situations where the measurement noise is significant .    to further validate our method",
    ", it would be interesting to test it with an empirical known drug whose effect in the propagating structure is known .",
    "to our knowledge , there is no such drug test , since they typically focus on the overall ( sum ) signal in the tissue and not in the features of its propagation throughout the tissue .",
    "all in all , this study proposes a procedure complementary to the standard approach where only the overall amplitude is tested before , during and after the application of a given drug . although it is not able to extract the physical interconnections between cells , our simple procedure provides a way for quantifying the functional connectivity in the tissue and to ascertain how it changes due to the application of drugs .",
    "the framework introduced here as well as the reported findings should now be used for a systematic pharmacological study .",
    "other more sophisticated approaches , namely a spectral analysis@xcite applied to these signal - propagation networks , could be useful . in this case",
    "larger tissues , having a larger number of astrocytes , are needed .    finally , while the method introduced in this paper is based in constraints that give results for primary functional connections ,",
    "some other interactions with a real physiological meaning could be further considered .",
    "namely , there can be autocatalytic phenomena by self - stimulation , some signals could be reversible or multiple stimulation of one cell may occur in other situations .",
    "forthcoming studies could further improve the ability for characterizing drug effects in living tissues by considering these more general effects , i.e.  several time - lags , or local maxima of the matrix solution , so that a hierarchy of interactions could be determined .",
