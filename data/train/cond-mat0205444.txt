    "since the discoveries of quantum hall effects and high @xmath3 oxides in 1980 s , the strongly correlated systems have been of great interests both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "as far as the high @xmath3 problem is concerned , the @xmath0 model is believed to be the appropriate starting model hamiltonian , because it captures the essence of the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom in superconducting @xmath4 oxides @xcite .",
    "although high-@xmath3 cuprates are ( at least ) two - dimensional systems , it is very interesting to study its one - dimensional ( 1d ) counterpart . as argued by anderson@xcite , two - dimensional strongly correlated systems may share some properties of 1d systems .",
    "in addition , the physical understanding of the 1d systems is also extremely helpful for the study of the ladder systems , which have been realized experimentally and have attracted a lot of attention in recent years@xcite .    in the 1d systems , the phase space of particle scattering",
    "is highly restricted .",
    "the occurrence of a single scattering event will spread quickly among all other particles , which invalidates the concept of individual excitations .",
    "consequently , we are often confronted with correlated collective excitations .",
    "on the other hand , in some cases we can benefit from such phase space restriction .",
    "namely , the many - particle scattering matrix could be nicely decomposed into the product of two - particle ones which satisfy the so - called yang - baxter integrable conditions@xcite .",
    "this property provides us with the possibility to exactly solve some 1d models , e.g. , the hubbard model@xcite , the heisenberg model@xcite , and the supersymmetric @xmath0 model@xcite . the exact solutions in turn",
    "provide us with powerful guidelines to develop and to justify certain approximate schemes for other problems .    in some sense",
    ", the 1d @xmath0 model could be viewed as a descendant of the hubbard model in large on - site repulsion limit .",
    "namely , the strong coupling limit of the hubbard model can be mapped into the weak coupling limit of the @xmath0 model .",
    "naively , one may speculate that the integrability of the 1d hubbard model would be inherited by the @xmath0 model in the whole parameter space .",
    "unfortunately , this speculation is not correct : the @xmath0 model is only integrable at two special points in parameter space .",
    "the reason for this difference is that , in contrast to other 1d integrable models , the hilbert space of the @xmath0 model is highly constrained : double occupancy of any site is completely excluded .",
    "furthermore , the integrable points of the @xmath0 model are located in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath5 in our convention below ) , not in the weak coupling limit .",
    "therefore , the integrability of the supersymmetric @xmath0 model is not simply inherited from the hubbard model .",
    "rather it is better to be viewed as a separate miracle of the interacting 1d many - particle system .",
    "since the 1d @xmath0 model can not be exactly solved at a generic point in parameter space , the analytical studies of the @xmath0 model have been a painstaking task even in the 1d case .",
    "to illustrate the points more clearly , let us take a close look at the @xmath0 model .",
    "the model delineates the behavior of hard core fermions on a discrete lattice , and the dynamics is given by the model hamiltonian @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the projection operator that prohibits double occupancy of any site , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the spin orientations ( with @xmath8=1 for @xmath10 , and -1 for @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath13 the anti - ferromagnetic ( @xmath14 ) or ferromagnetic ( @xmath15 ) coupling . due to the aforementioned constraints , at each site the states @xmath16 can only be one of the following three possible states : with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( empty ) .",
    "this hilbert space is neither fermionic nor bosonic .",
    "one can check that the projection operators @xmath19 close , under commutation and anti - commutation , to form a semi - simple supersymmetric lie algebra , the @xmath20 given by the relations@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fermionic operators that , respectively , create and annihilate a single electron .",
    "the bosonic operator @xmath24 are identified as the generators of the group @xmath25 . using these operators , the @xmath0 model can be neatly written as @xmath26 in terms of the bilinears in the generators of @xmath20 . but",
    "the price we have to pay is to introduce both fermionic and bosonic operators simultaneously . as a consequence ,",
    "it is difficult to make a simple , controlled approximation in this representation . to overcome the difficulties associated with the no - double - occupancy constraints , the slave boson and slave fermion method@xcite and , more recently , the supersymmetric hubbard operator method@xcite have been invented to treat the @xmath0 model , with the hope of the mean field ground state being relevant to the high-@xmath3 problem",
    "however , after more than one decade effort , it seems that a reliable ground state is still elusive .",
    "the seminal work by jordan and wigner@xcite and , later , by lieb , schultz , and mattis@xcite provides an alternative idea to handle the above hybridized situation in statistics : namely the spin operators are uniformly expressed in terms of fermionic operators , though the spin systems are neither bosonic nor fermionic ones . in the same spirit",
    ", one can also rewrite the @xmath0 model in terms of fermions exclusively .",
    "in addition to rewriting the magnetic interactions using the fermionc realization of the spin operators @xmath27 one may introduce as well the hubbard operators@xcite @xmath28 and rewrite the hopping terms in terms of them .",
    "these operators also realize the constraints that exclude double occupancy on each lattice site . in this way",
    ", one gets a formulation of the @xmath0 model completely in terms of fermionic operators .",
    "however , one immediately sees that the old hopping terms will induce extra four - fermion and six - fermion interactions .",
    "these interactions are `` hard '' ones , in the sense that their strengths are exactly the same as the hopping amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "this fact defies the attempts to treat the additional four- and six - fermion terms perturbatively .",
    "therefore , at first glance , it looks silly to adopt this strategy to solve the @xmath0 model unless new techniques can be invented to make the induced interactions tractable .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a technique that allows us to deal with these induced four- and six - fermion interactions .",
    "the key point is to use the idea of `` _ adiabatic continuity _ '' _ to soften _ the above - mentioned interactions induced by the no - double - occupancy constraints .",
    "namely , we propose to introduce the following _ deformed _ hubbard operators @xmath29 with a deformation parameter @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath1 approaches to unity , we recover the genuine hubbard operators ( [ hubbard ] ) . for @xmath31 , there is a non - zero probability to allow leakage into states with double occupancy . with these deformed hubbard operators ( [ deformed ] ) replacing the genuine hubbard operators ( [ hubbard ] ) in the hopping terms",
    ", we get a deformation of the original @xmath0 model .",
    "the deformed model has the advantage that for small @xmath1 , the induced four- and six - fermion interactions are no longer `` hard '' .",
    "this is because these interactions have strengths proportional to the deformation parameter @xmath1 and , therefore , is tractable in the sense of perturbation theory when @xmath1 is small .",
    "though small values of @xmath1 may not be `` physical '' , after extracting possible structures in the phase diagram for small @xmath1 , we analytically continue our results back to @xmath32 . the fundamental assumption underlying this continuation is the _",
    "adiabatic continuity _ ,",
    "namely that when the hamiltonian of the model is adiabatically changed with @xmath1 varying from a small positive value to unity , there is no essential , qualitative change in the phase diagram of the model , though various phase boundaries in parameter space may undergo a continuous deformation .",
    "historically , our idea of considering a deformed model is parallel to the ideas that underlie the replica method in treating disordered system , or the large @xmath33 expansion in field theory .",
    "actually , even in the field of 1d exactly solvable models one can find a precedent : yang and yang@xcite proposed the @xmath34 model as a deformation of the @xmath35 model , i.e. the spin-@xmath36 1d heisenberg model , and used it to justify the bethe ansatz method in the latter by first studying the large anisotropic limit and then continuing back to the isotropic limit . in this paper we will first discuss some simpler cases and give arguments to justify the adiabatic continuity assumption together with our deformed hubbard operators .",
    "of course , practically the justification may depend on how we treat the deformed model , which is a fully fermionized model containing four- and six - fermion interactions . in the present paper",
    ", we are going to combine the bosization method and perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) techniques to deal with the deformed @xmath0 model .",
    "namely we first bosonize the deformed model , and then use the rg flows to map out the phase diagram of the bosonized model .",
    "we will argue that the phase diagram obtained in this way does not change in an essential way , when the deformation parameter @xmath1 varies from a small positive value to unity .    for convenience",
    ", we will start with a simplified model .",
    "namely , we will first consider a model in which the magnetic spin - spin interactions are ising - like , i.e. of the form @xmath37 .",
    "this model , together with the usual hopping term , we call the @xmath38 model . then with a bit more complication , we would like to modify the isotropic magnetic interactions in eq .",
    "( [ tjhamilton ] ) to anisotropic @xmath34-type interactions : @xmath39 this model we call as the @xmath40 model .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath25 invariant @xmath0 model can be obtained in the double limit with @xmath41 ( the isotropic limit ) and with the deformation parameter @xmath2 ( the physical limit with no double occupancy ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the phase structure of the extremely anisotropic limit of the @xmath40 model , namely , the @xmath38 model .",
    "the convention of our bosonization scheme is also presented in detail in this section .",
    "then the discussions of the phase diagram for the 1d @xmath40 model are presented in the section iii . in section iv",
    ", we compare our results with other work .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are summarized in the section v.",
    "the 1d @xmath38 model represents a strongly anisotropic limit of the @xmath25 @xmath0 model , in which only has the ising part of the magnetic interactions been included . without hopping ,",
    "this simplification is significant for understanding purely magnetic interactions .",
    "however , with hopping the model is more interesting in that it has incorporated the interplay between hopping and the exchange interactions , which makes the physics of the model highly non - trivial .",
    "therefore , the model has recently attracted a lot of interests@xcite .",
    "it is known from the numerical studies that the low - energy physics in both the @xmath38 and @xmath0 models@xcite shares some common features even in two dimensions . in the real world , the possible origin of exchange anisotropy is the spin - orbital coupling@xcite . in the extremely anisotropic limit , the hamiltonian ( for the @xmath38 model ) reads @xmath44 following eq .",
    "( [ spinrealization ] ) , we use the representation of @xmath45 given by @xmath46 note the appearance of the hubbard operators ( [ hubbard ] ) in the hopping terms .",
    "it is the presence of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ hubbard ] ) that realizes the no double occupancy constraints , as a consequence , the term @xmath47 is no longer a simple hopping of fermions : more interaction terms with four or six fermions are induced , with strengths of the same order of magnitude as the hopping amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "how to deal with these interaction terms is an important issue .    to reduce the strengths of the interaction terms induced by the no double occupancy constraints",
    ", we propose to deform the model hamiltonian ( [ tjz ] ) by replacing the hubbard operators with the deformed hubbard operators ( [ deformed ] ) , resulting in @xmath48 the hamiltonians @xmath49(@xmath50 ) , in terms of the genuine fermion operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are given by @xmath53 which represents the genuine hopping term , and @xmath54    here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the induced four fermion repulsive interaction to prevent double occupancy of the same lattice site , and the @xmath57 term is attractive , representing the effects from the six fermion interactions that compensate to the excessive repulsion in @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to see that now in the deformed model , all the induced terms @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are proportional to the deformation parameter @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ deformed ] ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is small , the induced interactions are `` softened '' , becoming tractable in perturbation theory . in the limit of @xmath2 ,",

    "the second term is a constant and can be shifted away by redefining the energy zero point .",
    "we will drop it throughout the rest of the paper .    in one dimension ,",
    "the definition of exchange statistics is ambiguous , since the no double occupancy condition excludes the possibility to physically exchange spatial position of two particles .",

    "this situation is quite different from that of the three dimensional case , where the exchange statistics of particles has an absolute meaning . in two dimensions",

    "the definitions of @xmath166 and @xmath167 are @xmath168 it is now easy to observe that the low energy effective hamiltonian possesses the following duality property : namely , the hamiltonian ( [ effectivespin ] ) is invariant under the following transformation @xmath169 note that such a duality does not appear in the @xmath38 model or in the hubbard model .",
    "but it is also interesting to note that it appeared in the 1d @xmath170 thirring model@xcite and in the case of two coupled luttinger liquids@xcite .",
    "compared with the sine - gordon system , the symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ effectivespin ] ) is discrete , while there is a hidden @xmath171 symmetry in the sine - gordon system , which reflects the @xmath171 invariance of its dual fermionic model ( the massive thirring model ) .",
    "it is also easy to get the scaling dimension for the cosine terms of the field @xmath117 and its conjugate @xmath172 as @xmath173 therefore , one of the two cosine terms is always relevant , which is associated with the ordering of the @xmath174- or @xmath80-field .",
    "let us discuss the following two different cases separately .",
    "\\(i ) when the scaling dimension @xmath175 , the @xmath176 term is relevant .",
    "this case is similar to the @xmath38 case , and the system eventually flows to the spin - peierls phase for @xmath141 or the ising - neel order for @xmath177 respectively .",
    "\\(ii ) when the scaling dimension @xmath178 , the @xmath179 term is relevant . in this case , since @xmath157 is always negative , therefore the system flows toward the ising - neel phase only .    in summary , we see that the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 can only be partially accessed in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the difference in the two cases reflects the fact that the duality transformation ( [ duality ] ) can only be realized in part of the parameter space , since the coupling constant @xmath157 is definitely negative , while the coupling constant @xmath137 can be either negative or positive , depending on the interplay between @xmath12 and @xmath126 .",
    "in this paper , the phase diagram of the most general 1d @xmath40 model is discussed based on bosonization and rge . to make sense of the bosonization procedure for the interactions induced by no double occupancy constraints , we have introduced deformed hubbard operators ( [ deformed ] ) , which contain a deformation parameter @xmath1 . while at @xmath32 the no double occupancy constraints at each site are recovered ,",
    "the case with a small positive @xmath1 is accessible to perturbative rg analysis . since the basic structure of the bosonized low energy effective hamiltonian",
    "is argued to be determined only by the symmetry requirements , the bosonized form of the low energy effective hamiltonian with a small deformation parameter @xmath1 is expected to survive the limit @xmath2 .",
    "however , we can not simply use the values of @xmath120 and @xmath92 to make precise predictions on the phase diagram , since these values are not reliable at @xmath32 .",
    "we should take the strategy in which both @xmath120 and @xmath92 are considered as phenomenological parameters .    for the case with @xmath180 ,",
    "the model is reduced to the so - called @xmath38 model . in this case",
    ", the spin sector can flow to three distinct phases : the gapless phase , the spin - peierls phase , and the ising - neel phase , depending on the range of the parameters , meanwhile the charge dynamics remains always gapless . in the case with @xmath181 , where the @xmath182 represents the value to make @xmath183 and @xmath184 , the system flows to the ising - neel ordering in spin dynamics .",
    "we identify this phase as the so - called phase separation ( ps ) phase . for the case with @xmath185 and @xmath184 ,",
    "the spin sector eventually flows to the spin - peierls phase which is gapful .",
    "we can identify this phase as a superconducting phase ( sc ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath129 , the spin sector flows toward a gapless phase and thus the system flows toward the tomonoga - luttinger liquid phase .",
    "such a phase is consistent with the phase diagram constructed by los alamos group in ref .",
    ", where the authors mapped the @xmath38 model into the 1d @xmath34 model and construct the phase diagram from the knowledge of exact solutions for the 1d @xmath34 model .",
    "this consistency also helps us to justify our proposal to use the deformed hubbard operators and the continuation from the case of @xmath186 to the desired case @xmath32 .    in the opposite limit , namely @xmath187",
    ", the modified @xmath0 model can be reduced the the @xmath188 model . in this case , we still have @xmath137 generally non - zero due to the no - double - occupancy induced interactions . therefore , the phase diagram of the @xmath188 model is expected to be similar to the case of the most general @xmath40 model .",
    "namely , the system is generically gapful in the spin sector and thus can not flow toward the tomonoga - luttinger phase .",
    "this result is a little bit different from the naive speculation that the @xmath38 model should be basically similar to the @xmath0 model . from our study , we conclude that there are some delicate differences between the two cases , since the @xmath150 part and the ising part of the magnetic interactions play a different role in spin ordering .                        c. k. lai , j. math .",
