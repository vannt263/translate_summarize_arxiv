    "<S> alkali - filled hollow - core fibres are a promising medium for investigating light - matter interactions , especially at the single - photon level , due to the tight confinement of light and high optical depths achievable by light - induced atomic desorption . however , until now these large optical depths could only be generated for seconds at most once per day , severely limiting the practicality of the technology . </S>",
    "<S> here we report the generation of highest observed transient ( @xmath0 for up to a minute ) and highest observed persistent ( @xmath1 for hours ) optical depths of alkali vapours in a light - guiding geometry to date , using a caesium - filled kagom - type hollow - core photonic crystal fibre . </S>",
    "<S> our results pave the way to light - matter interaction experiments in confined geometries requiring long operation times and large atomic number densities , such as generation of single - photon - level nonlinearities and development of single photon quantum memories .    </S>",
    "<S> optical quantum memories are a crucial component of photonic quantum technologies , enabling the storage and manipulation of optically encoded quantum information @xcite or temporal multiplexing of probabilistic operations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such memories require strong light - matter coupling that facilitates the transformation of a photon into a matter excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling strength can be increased from the material side , by increasing the number of atoms interacting with light , i.e. the optical depth ( od ) , or from the photonic side , by confining the photons in a waveguide geometry , which overcomes the focused light interaction length limit imposed by free - space diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> warm vapours contained in hollow - core photonic crystal fibres ( hc - pcf ) are therefore a promising candidate for such applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another exciting approach are cold atomic gases coupled to tapered optical fibres @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> hc - pcfs filled with alkali vapours have been used to demonstrate the basic building blocks required for photonic quantum information processing , i.e. single - photon level optical nonlinearities @xcite ( with the potential of using rydberg atoms @xcite ) and optical memories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter application especially requires fibres of relatively large core sizes ( @xmath2 m ) , such as the kagom fibres used in this work , as the transit time of atoms through the core can be a fundamental limit to the memory efficiency and lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> an exciting solution to this is the use of spin - preserving coatings , but their use in confined geometries is still under investigation @xcite .    due to the alkali s reactivity , adsorption to the core surfaces significantly limits the ambient optical depths achievable in hc - pcfs . </S>",
    "<S> two ways to overcome this limitation is to use less reactive non - alkali vapours such as mercury @xcite or use ultracold alkali atoms contactlessly guided within the fibre core @xcite . in the case of warm alkali vapours , on the other hand , light - induced atomic desorption ( liad ) </S>",
    "<S> has been used to generate high transient ods in hollow - core fibres @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high - power infrared laser light stimulates the desorption of alkalis via at least two pathways : one , the direct vapourisation of metallic layers , and two , surface - plasmon enhanced heating of metallic nanoclusters @xcite . in bulk glass cells , </S>",
    "<S> liad was used to generate persistent moderate increases in optical depth ( 600% over 15 minutes ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the persistency of high od using liad has been elusive . here , we report the observation of ultra - high transient and high persistent optical depth of caesium ( cs ) confined in large - core kagom hc - pcfs of two different core sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a phenomenological model that agrees with our observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was the following . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the effect of liad on two 20 cm kagom - structured hc - pcfs of @xmath3 m and @xmath4 m core diameters ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two fibres were inserted inside a single vacuum chamber , which was consequently baked and evacuated to a base pressure @xmath5 torr . </S>",
    "<S> the chamber was then passively loaded with caesium from an ampoule inside the system . </S>",
    "<S> after loading the chamber for a month at @xmath6c , we turned down the temperature to a room level of @xmath7c , keeping the windows slightly warmer in order to avoid cs accumulation , and allowed it to further load for 12 months , over which we conducted experiments . this time </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) schematic of the experiment . ]    </S>",
    "<S> in order to measure the optical depth of caesium vapours inside the fibres , we send in a weak probe beam [ @xmath8 nw into the @xmath9 m hc - pcf ] derived from an external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) , that is scanned in frequency over the d2 line of cs ( @xmath10 , at 852 nm ) and coupled into the fibre core . </S>",
    "<S> we use a combination of flipper mirrors and translation stages for switchable coupling into the two fibres , as shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted light is subsequently measured on an avalanche photodiode ( thorlabs apd110a / m ) , operated in linear mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the resultant transmission profile is fitted to a series of voigt functions , i.e. convolutions of the lorenzian function due to homogenous broadening and gaussian function from the inhomogenous broadening of the transitions from the different hyperfine states of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption pre - factor @xmath12 and inhomogenous linewidth @xmath13 were taken as free parameters of the fit . assuming the homogenous linewidth @xmath14 ( as we observe in our fitting , taking into account possible self - broadening effects at higher densities @xcite ) , the absorption pre - factor @xmath12 can be related to the `` on - resonance '' optical depth @xmath15 via    @xmath16    the desorbing liad beam is derived from an ecdl at 780 nm , which is amplified via a tapered amplifier , and sent into a single mode fibre . with this </S>",
    "<S> we generate up to 300 mw of liad light which we couple , counter - propagating with respect to the weak probe , into the hc - pcf . </S>",
    "<S> the effective intra - fibre liad power was around 80 mw . in order to separate the </S>",
    "<S> residual back - reflected ( mostly from the hc - pcf end face ) liad beam from the weak probe , we use a combination of polarisation and spectral filtering ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ( c ) ) .    in order to explore the long - lived temporal dynamics of the optical depth due to liad in our system </S>",
    "<S> , we take a series of over 20,000 consecutive probe transmission scans ( which correspond to three hours of data acquisition ) , during which we turn liad on and off with an electronically - controlled shutter . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : example ] shows typical measured transmission , along with fits , of the weak probe beam through the @xmath4 m core fibre when its frequency is scanned over the d2 line of cs for the case of liad being off ( top ) and at the peak od of it being on ( bottom ) . due to the large cores of kagom - type hc - pcfs , there is a measurable trace of non - adsorbed alkali in the vapour phase even at room temperature with liad being off .     </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig : odlong26 ] shows the change in optical depth of cs in a @xmath3 m kagom hc - pcf when liad illumination is applied at room temperature over three hours . within the span of 10s </S>",

    "<S> insets show the behaviour of the optical depth at the beginning ( left - bottom ) and end ( right - bottom ) of liad illumination . ]    after the sharp initial rise , the od drops by an order of magnitude over 4 minutes . </S>",
    "<S> this is a significantly longer time for which such high ods have been observed in a similar system before @xcite . over the next 3 hours the optical depth remains above 2000 </S>",
    "<S> this is the highest persistent liad - induced od ever observed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : odlong44 ] shows similar data for the @xmath4 m core fibre . </S>",
    "<S> the initial rise in od is slightly slower than in the @xmath3 m core fibre ( 20s rise time ) , but the final od reached is higher , at @xmath24 , after which it stays above @xmath25 for up to a minute . </S>",
    "<S> this is to our knowledge the highest reached od in an alkali - filled hollow - core fibre system and is comparable to the ods generated by heating bulk cells to hundreds of degrees , even though the fibre system operates at room temperature , extending its operational lifetime , and allowing for faster and more precise control of the optical depth .    </S>",

    "<S> insets show the behaviour of the optical depth at the beginning ( left - bottom ) and end ( right - top ) of liad illumination . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the visible mid - term fluctuations in liad - induced od can be attributed to changing liad powers , due to experimental instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> switching off the liad beam ( at @xmath26s and @xmath27s in the insets of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : odlong26 ] and [ fig : odlong44 ] , respectively ) causes the od to rapidly drop .    </S>",
    "<S> the liad - induced changes in od appear to be governed by two processess of different timescales : a sharp initial rise and fall in od over the course of a few minutes and a subsequent significantly slower fall in od over the course of hours . </S>",
    "<S> the initial sharp peak in od only occurs for the first run of the experiment per day and requires around a day of quiescence to regenerate to its former level , which is consistent with previous observations in similar systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to the highly efficient light - induced desorption of alkali nanoclusters , which require several hours of quiescence to reform on the surface of the fibre core in order to be efficiently desorbed again . </S>",
    "<S> high - power light can also desorb alkalis deposited as metallic layers . </S>",
    "<S> layer desorption is considered to be much less efficient , but leads to a constant elevated level of od , since the re - adsorbed alkali can be immediately desorbed @xcite .    however , considering only the desorption of nanoclusters and layers , and their reformation / readsorption , does not explain the slow fall in od observed in our experiment . in order for our model of liad to mimic the data correctly , we had to include another process . </S>",
    "<S> this process decreases the amount of cs in the whole system under liad illumination , but regenerates it during the period of darkness . in coated bulk cells , the process responsible for similar long - term depletion of desorbable alkali </S>",
    "<S> was identified to be its interaction with the coating itself , including light - stimulated absorption into the coating @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar depletion effect was also observed in liad from porous alumina , where the pores acted as a sink for the atoms @xcite , and in vapour cells with closable stems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that in glass hollow - core fibres the mechanism responsible for long - term depletion of alkali vapour during liad illumination is the escape of the vapour out of the fibre ends , due to a strong , liad - induced vapor pressure differential on the boundary between the fibre and its surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> we have devised a rate equation model based on the assumptions outlined above , obtaining the following set of equations :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 are the fractions of atoms in the vapour , layer and nanocluster phase , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms on the right - hand side of the first equation describe liad , i.e. the light - induced desorption of metallic layers and nanoclusters . </S>",
    "<S> the desorption rates are @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the layers and nanoclusters respectively , with nanocluster desorption much more efficient ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is the liad beam power . </S>",
    "<S> the next two terms describe the equilibrium processes of alkali adsorption as layers and its escape out of the fibre as vapour . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the adsorption rate ( fast ) and equilibrium ratio of atoms in the vapour and layer phases . @xmath36 is the fraction of atoms in the sink , i.e. outside the fibre , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the atomic escape rate from the fibre ( slow ) and the equilibrium ratio of atoms on the outside and inside the fibre ( in the vapour phase ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : model ] shows a comparison between experimental data ( top ) and the numerical solution of the model ( bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model was fed with the measured liad power in the fibre , and the rate coefficients from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rateeq ] were found manually ( shown in table [ tab : tab1 ] ) , in order to get the closest similarity to data . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the model accurately describes the qualitative features of the data , confirming that the process limiting the long - term od is reversible absorption of the atoms into a sink during prolonged liad illumination , which physically could be the escape of the atomic vapour into the space outside the fibre ends .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : model ] . * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    in summary , we have constructed a caesium - filled hollow - core fibre system which combines high alkali atomic densities with strong light guidance at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> after passively loading two fibres of @xmath3 m and @xmath4 m core diameters with the alkali for almost a year , we generate the highest observed transient ods @xmath0 in this system using light - induced atomic desorption . </S>",
    "<S> we are then able to maintain ods larger than 2000 for at least three hours . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to a long loading time of the fibre and high in - coupled liad optical power . </S>",
    "<S> we observe no significant difference in the liad dynamics between the two core sizes . </S>",
    "<S> using a rate - equation model approach , we identified the loss of atoms , possibly due to their escape from the fibre during liad illumination , as the main process responsible for the long - term fall in od .    a possible way to prevent the long - term drop in od </S>",
    "<S> is to seal the alkali - filled hc - pcf ends to prevent the atoms inside from escaping . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved for example , by splicing the hc - pcf to single mode fibres , creating a fibre - based microcell @xcite , which has the additional benefit of being integratable into current photonic networks . </S>",
    "<S> the duration of the transient ultrahigh ods due to nanocluster desorption would still be limited by the long reformation time of the nanoclusters .    </S>",
    "<S> these results open the way towards using an alkali - filled fibre for conducting time- and atomic density - intensive experiments , such as investigating single photon quantum memories @xcite or single photon nonlinearities @xcite . </S>"
