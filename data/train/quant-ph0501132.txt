    "the maximally entangled state shared between alice and bob plays a crucial role in the standard teleportation method .",
    "the entanglement is essential in quantum information because of its unique advantages that can be applied to many fields , such as quantum teleportation [ 1 ] , quantum cryptograph [ 2 ] , etc .",
    "however , the decoherence from environment always impacts on the degree of entanglement , so the resource of maximally entangled states is hard to prepare in a real experiment .",
    "certainly , a mixed entangled state as the resource is approximately near to the real circumstances . for experimental investigations of quantum computation and quantum communication , the thermal equilibrium state in heisenberg model is one fundamental sort of mixed and entangled states [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "recently , bowen _ et .",
    "[ 5 ] and horodeckies [ 6 ] have suggested that teleportation as the resource of mixed states via the standard method , i. e. , bell - type measurements and pauli rotations , is equivalent to a general depolarising channel [ 5 - 7 ] . in some schemes of teleportation using heisenberg model , half of two qubits can be teleported by the sole two - qubit mixed state [ 5 ] . in other schemes ,",
    "entanglement of a special mixed state , i. e. , werner state , can be transferred through a pair of two - qubit mixed states [ 8 , 9 ] . however , the entanglement teleportation of the whole two - qubit system as the resource of the thermal mixed state needs to be investigated . meanwhile , to see more clearly the possible applications of heisenberg model in quantum teleportation , mutual information of the quantum channel also needs to be analyzed .    in this paper , the information transmission by a pair of thermal mixed states in 1d heisenberg @xmath3 chains is investigated .",
    "the minimal entanglement in the quantum channel is needed to transfer entanglement information .",
    "the high average fidelity of teleportation is obtained when the temperature is very low and the magnetic field is weak .",
    "the entanglement quality of input signal states and the mutual information are analyzed . in section 2 ,",
    "entanglement of the thermal mixed state in a 1d heisenberg @xmath3 chain is presented .",
    "the entanglement teleportation of two - qubit pure states and fidelity are derived . in section 3",

    "similar to the standard teleportation , the entanglement teleportation for the mixed channel of an input entangled state is destroyed and its replica state appears at the remote place after applying local measurement in the form of linear operators .",
