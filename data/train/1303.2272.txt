    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics provides a renormalizable theory where charged fermions acquire dirac masses through the higgs mechanism . in this model",
    "the neutrinos stand out , lacking charges or any other additively conserved quantum numbers to distinguish particle and antiparticle , and consequently having the possibility of both dirac and majorana masses , yet acquiring neither in the sm . the structure of the sm  the absence of right - handed fields necessary for dirac masses and of dimensional effective couplings necessary for majorana masses  eliminates neutrino mass terms .",
    "consequently the discovery 15 years ago of massive neutrinos supports the modern view of the sm as an effective theory , where for example majorana neutrino masses would arise from the sm s unique dimension - five operator , and thus can be considered the most natural correction to that model . hence neutrino masses represent an important opportunity to look for extensions of the sm and to determine the scales of the new physics that we now need to add to that model .",
    "experiment has confirmed that there is a hierarchy of neutrino masses , just as there are differences between electron , muon , and tauon masses , though the overall scale of neutrino masses is radically different from that of the charged fermions , below @xmath0 an ev rather than @xmath1 mev .",
    "this has implications for the scale of the new physics .",
    "it has also confirmed that there is flavor violation among the neutrinos ",
    "the mass and weak interaction eigenstates are different  with the mixing angles being much larger than those found among the quarks .",
    "this has provided us with a powerful tool for probing neutrino properties , oscillations that couple the flavors with significant amplitudes .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing , as well as the changes in the mixing that accompanies neutrino propagation in matter , has stimulated a great deal of new experimental and theoretical activity .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have provided a reasonably clear picture of neutrino mixing angles and neutrino mass differences , though their are important issues not yet unresolved .",
    "some of the remaining questions can be addressed with neutrino oscillations ",
    "e.g. , the mass hierarchy , the dirac cp phase , and the possible existence of additional neutrino generations  and some questions  the absolute scale of neutrino mass , the nature of that mass ( its dirac / majorana character ) , and the majorana cp phases  must be addressed by other techniques .",
    "this review summarizes the current status of neutrino oscillation studies and prospects for further exploiting this probe to test neutrino properties .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix defines the relationship between the mass eigenstate and weak ( flavor ) eigenstate bases , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the cp - violating phase . in writing eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) we have omitted the two majorana phases because these play no role in neutrino oscillations .",
    "note that the association of the cp - violating phase with @xmath6 is simply a parametrization choice .",
    "in fact the cp - violating difference of the neutrino survival probabilities @xmath7 is proportional to a product of the sines of all three mixing angles .    consider a particular flavor eigenstate , @xmath8 , created at some point in time by weak interactions , where the indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote flavor and mass eigenstates respectively .",
    "the subsequent propagation of this state is controlled by the free lagrangian and consequently by the neutrino masses .",
    "as the neutrino travels downstream from the source , the different mass eigenstates accumulate phases that depend on their masses , with the differences in these phases governing the beating among the mass eigenstates .",
    "if the initial state of definite flavor was created as a three - momentum eigenstate ( a simplification , as one should employ wave packets ) , the amplitude for finding the state in its original flavor at time @xmath11 and distance @xmath12 from the source is @xmath13 the time evolution of this state is governed by the @xmath14 , given that a momentum eigenstate was assumed , which we expand for small neutrino masses as @xmath15 .",
    "the flavor of the state thus evolves if some of the @xmath16 differ .",
    "the electron neutrino survival probability downstream can be evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) , @xmath17 - \\cos^4 \\theta_{13 } \\sin^2 2 \\theta_{12 } \\sin^2 ( \\delta_{21 } l)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the distance traveled ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 similar probabilities can be evaluated for new flavors appearing downstream , with the probabilities summing to 1 .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath21 and mass differences @xmath22 ( include their signs ) can thus be determined from the variation of the neutrino oscillation pattern with distance and beam energy .",
    "if the case of oscillations among three light neutrinos , only two of the three @xmath23s are independent , as @xmath24 .    just as photons traveling through matter propagate according to their index of refraction , neutrinos traveling through matter acquire effective masses due to coherent forward scattering off surrounding particles @xcite .",
    "the flavor dependence of this phenomenon  ordinary matter contains electrons , but not muons or tauons  can lead to striking effects , enhancing neutrino oscillation probabilities relative to those seen in vacuum @xcite . the phenomenon is a familiar one , an adiabatic level crossing , and is particularly dramatic for small mixing angles .",
    "for example , an electron neutrino that might be nearly coincident with a light neutrino mass eigenstate in vacuum ( @xmath25 ) would be coincident with the local heavy mass eigenstate at sufficiently high density ( @xmath26 ) , as the effective mass contribution of the matter overcomes the @xmath27 difference that exists in vacuum .",
    "for example , in the sun the electron neutrinos produced in the high - density solar core could be nearly coincident with the heavy - mass eigenstates .",
    "if the neutrino then propagates adiabatically from high density to the vacuum that exists at the solar surface  this requires that the local oscillation length always be small compared to the scale height of solar density changes  the neutrino would then emerge into vacuum on the heavy - mass trajectory , which would be nearly coincident with , say , the muon neutrino .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect .",
    "the oscillations that occur among three neutrino species in the presence of static matter is governed by the equation @xmath28 \\left(\\matrix { \\psi_e\\cr \\psi_{\\mu }      \\cr      \\psi_{\\tau } } \\right),\\ ] ] where the wolfenstein potentials in charge - neutral and unpolarized matter are given by @xmath29 for charged - current weak interactions and by @xmath30 for neutral current interactions . in these equations",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron and neutron number densities of the medium , respectively . as an overall phase does not contribute to the interferences , we can take out a term proportional to the identity by defining @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and subtracting @xmath35 from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ msw ] ) .",
    "hence , the term @xmath36 drops out of the msw equations for active neutrinos  leaving @xmath37 to generate the electron neutrino effective mass in the solar example given above .",
    "however , if sterile neutrinos are present , eq .",
    "( [ msw ] ) must be expanded to include the additional neutrino species , and @xmath36 would then contribute to the potential coupling active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "also note that there is a sm loop correction @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the proton number density of the medium , @xmath40 is the tau lepton mass , @xmath41 is the weinberg angle , and @xmath42 is the mass of the w - boson .",
    "this correction is negligible for the phenomena we consider here , but may be important in core - collapse supernovae",
    ". similarly we will ignore interactions between neutrinos , which again play an important role in supernovae due to the enormous neutrino densities produced by neutrino trapping @xcite .",
    "often matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations , eq .",
    "( [ msw ] ) , are treated by retaining just two of the three flavors .",
    "indeed if the mixing angle @xmath43 were zero , eq .",
    "( [ msw ] ) can be exactly reduced to a two - dimensional problem @xcite . as two - flavor evolution is numerically simpler",
    "it is still widely employed .",
    "the contribution of the non - zero value of @xmath43 to the electron neutrino survival probability can be obtained using the formula @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( we are envisioning an application to a case like the sun , where spherical symmetry can be assumed , and thus where densities are a function of the radial coordinate only . here",
    "@xmath46 is the solar center . )",
    "this formula is obtained by expanding the full survival probability as a power series in @xmath47 .",
    "one can calculate the survival probability for the two - flavor case in eq .",
    "( [ 3x3 ] ) by solving the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the msw level crossing , where the adiabatic condition is most severe , is the point where the diagonal terms are equal to zero .    in some situations",
    "the matter basis simplifies the solutions ; by making the change of basis @xmath51 the flavor - basis hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ mswmod3 ] ) can be instantaneously diagonalized .",
    "the cosine of this matter mixing angle is @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( this result corresponds to the more familiar two - flavor relationship between flavor and local - mass eigenstates when @xmath54 . )    note that matter effects depend on the sign of @xmath55 , i.e. , on the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "furthermore , as the matter background is not cp - symmetric ( no antiparticles ) , matter effects induce an effective cp violation",
    ". however , in the absence of sterile neutrino mixing , the cp - violating phase @xmath5 does not impact neutrino oscillations even in the presence of a matter background @xcite .",
    "the sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via @xmath57 consequently stars , including our sun , are prodigious sources of neutrinos .",
    "this conversion proceeds primarily through the pp chain in lower mass , cooler stars like our sun , and primarily through the cno cycles in heavier mass , hotter stars .",
    "the pp chain , responsible for @xmath0 99% of solar energy production , is comprised of three principal cycles , ppi , ppii , and ppiii , each of which is associated with a distinctive neutrino source .",
    "the competition among these three cycles in very sensitive to temperature .",
    "the cn i cycle contribution to solar energy generation depends on pre - existing c and n to catalyze reactions , and thus is sensitive to metallicity as well as temperature . despite its minor role in solar energy generation ,",
    "the cn i cycle produces neutrino fluxes from the @xmath58 decays of @xmath59c and @xmath60n that are potentially measurable .",
    "the reaction chains are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycles ] , including pp - chain branching ratios from a recently updated standard solar model ( ssm ) , gs98-sfii @xcite .",

    "the right frame shows the cn i cycle , which produces the @xmath59n and @xmath60o neutrinos .",
    "figure from @xcite.,width=642 ]    pontecorvo first suggested that neutrinos might be detectable by radiochemical means in a large volume of chlorine - bearing liquid ( see the reproduction of his original paper in ref .",
    "this idea was subsequently developed by l. alvarez and later by r. davis , jr . in 1964",
    "davis and his theoretical colleague j. bahcall argued in back - to - back physical review letters @xcite that a successful solar neutrino experiment could be done , given a sufficient detector volume and a deep underground location to reduce cosmic - ray - associated backgrounds .",
    "they gave as the scientific motivation for their proposal  .. to see into the interior of a star and thus verify directly the hypothesis of nuclear energy generation ... \" first results from the cl detector were reported in 1968 @xcite , and it soon became apparent that the measured solar neutrino flux was about one third that predicted by the ssm of the time .",
    "the source of this discrepancy was unclear for many years because of the large contribution of the high - energy @xmath65b neutrinos to the cl capture rate : the flux of these neutrinos is so sensitive to the solar core temperatures that a 5% reduction in that temperature would have brought theory into agreement with measurement .",
    "the situation began to clarify around 1990 , when three new experiments produced data .",
    "the converted proton - decay water cerenkov detector kamiokande ii reported the results of 450 days of solar neutrino running in 1989 , establishing that the @xmath65b flux was @xmath0 46% the ssm model prediction @xcite , in approximate agreement with the davis result .",
    "the signal in this detector was the cherenkov light produced by recoiling electrons after neutrino scattering .",
    "this experiment was the first to detect neutrinos in real time and the first to establish their solar origin by correlating the direction of electron scattering events with the position of the sun .",
    "first results from sage and gallex , radiochemical detectors employing @xmath66ga as a target because of its low threshold and consequent sensitivity to pp solar neutrinos , were reported in 1991 and 1992 , respectively .",
    "the 1991 sage result , based on the first five extractions of the daughter nucleus @xmath66ge , was an upper bound on the counting rate of 79 snu at 90% c.l.@xcite ( snu = solar neutrino unit , 10@xmath67 captures / target atom / sec ) .",
    "the 1992 gallex result , based on an initial 14 extractions , was @xmath68 snu @xcite .",
    "both rates were uncomfortably close to the minimum astronomical value of 79 snu @xcite , which assumes only a steady - state sun and standard - model weak interaction physics .",
    "gallex and its successor gno operated until 2003 @xcite ; sage remains an active experiment @xcite .",
    "because the chemistry of @xmath66ge extraction from ga is considerably more complicated than that of @xmath69ar extraction from cl , efforts were made to calibrate the overall efficiency of both ga experiments with intense @xmath70cr and @xmath69ar neutrino sources ( @xmath0 0.5 mci ) @xcite .",
    "four such calibration experiments were performed , yielding a weighted average of measured to expected @xmath66ge of 0.87 @xmath71 0.05 @xcite .",
    "a counting rate of 66.1 @xmath71 3.1 snu @xcite was obtained by combining all results from sage , gallex , and gno through 2009 .",
    "this rate can be compared to the gs98-sfii ssm prediction of 126.6 @xmath71 4.2 snu @xcite .    in the early 1990s , particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from kamioka ii and the ga experiments , no individual experiment required a non - astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "but in aggregate , the cl , kamioka ii , and ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the ssm .",
    "this was pointed out in a series of papers by various authors as the data became more constraining , eventually establishing with a high degree of confidence that the observed rates were inconsistent with the assumptions of a steady - state sun producing undistorted fluxes of solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these early results combined with the spectacular success of the ssm in another context  reproducing the sound speed profile deduced from helioseismology to sub-1% accuracy throughout much of the solar interior @xcite  made a particle - physics solution to the solar neutrino problem more likely .",
    "this is turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors .",
    "these experiments are super - kamiokande , a 50-kiloton water cherenkov detector from which the @xmath65b flux was determined to better than 3% ; the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) , which employed a central 1-kiloton volume of heavy water in order to measure three neutrino reaction channels with different sensitivities to flavor ; and borexino , which uses liquid scintillator , extending real - time , event - by - event counting to low energy fluxes such as the @xmath72be and pep neutrinos .",
    "both super - kamiokande and borexino continue to operate .",
    "results from the sno detector were definitive in proving new particle physics was responsible for the solar neutrino deficit ray davis first discovered .",
    "like super - kamiokande , sno was able to detect elastic scattering ( es ) events @xmath73 which , due to the charged - current contribution to @xmath64 scattering , has a relative sensitivity to @xmath64s and heavy - flavor neutrinos of @xmath0 7:1 .",
    "in addition , sno could detect @xmath64s through the charged current ( cc ) reaction @xmath74 by observing the cherenkov light from the recoiling electron .",
    "unlike the es case , in the cc reaction the @xmath75 carries away most of the energy release , so that the electron recoil spectrum becomes an important test of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "sno s third reaction was the neutral current ( nc ) breakup reaction @xmath76 this reaction is independent of flavor and thus sensitive to the total flux of neutrinos : by detecting the neutron , one can determine a rate that corresponds to an integral over the neutrino spectrum above the 2.22 mev deuterium breakup threshold . to exploit this reaction ,",
    "great care had to be taken to reduce background sources of neutrons from natural radioactivity and from cosmic ray muons .",
    "sno s great depth , two kilometers below the surface , was helpful in addressing the latter .",
    "the sno experiment was carried out in three phases in which distinct methods were used in the nc channel , neutron capture on deuterium , on cl introduced as salt in the heavy water , and in an array of @xmath77he proportional counters constructed in the central detector .",
    "the sno results for the cc , es , and nc channels , the super - kamiokande es results , and the predictions of the ssm circa 2005 are shown in fig .",

    ", the multiple detector configurations currently employed in the daya bay and reno experiments also minimize the effects of reactor neutrino spectrum uncertainties .",
    "the situation is rather different for longer - baseline experiments searching for the appearance of electron neutrinos in a flux of muon neutrinos . for longer baselines neutrinos travel trough the earth , hence matter effects need to be included .",

    "note that an intermediate - baseline ( @xmath87 km ) reactor antineutrino experiment will also have some sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the puzzle that arose from early solar neutrino measurements had an interesting resolution , still incomplete .",
    "we have reviewed what has been learned in the past 15 years about the properties of neutrinos from oscillations in vacuum and in matter , using astrophysical neutrino sources and terrestrial beams .",
    "a great deal of progress has been made , with three mixing angles and two mass differences now accurately determined , and with the sign of @xmath88 deduced the effects of solar matter on solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "yet there are several important properties of the light neutrinos that we have not yet been able to determine : the overall scale of the neutrino masses , the mass hierarchy , the dirac cp - violating phase in the mixing matrix , and neutrino charge - conjugation properties .",
    "we have the tools to make further progress .",
    "long - baseline neutrino beam oscillation experiments could distinguish between the normal and inverted mass patterns and determine the cp phase .",
    "as we have noted , there may be alternative strategies in which reactor and atmospheric neutrino sources are exploited to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "a variety of cosmological tests are sensitive to the absolute scale of neutrino mass : the distinctive imprint of neutrino mass on the growth of large - scale structure , affecting both the scale and red - shift dependence of that growth , produces changes in the power spectrum that are roughly an order of magnitude larger than one might naively guess , based on the contribution of neutrinos to the mass density .",
    "there are a variety of ongoing projects to improve laboratory sensitivity to neutrino mass , such as the high - sensitivity spectrometer katrin for measuring tritium beta decay and the mare micro - calorimeters for measuring @xmath89re beta decay , as well as new technologies for overcoming resolution challenges , such as the project 8 extension to katrin .",
    "finally , the exciting question of whether nature exploits the neutrino s unique majorana mass mechanism is stimulating next - generation efforts in double beta decay . as progress is made on all of these fronts , neutrino oscillations will remain one of our most important and most versatile tools from probing the new properties of neutrinos , and thus for seeking new physics beyond the sm .    this work of abb was supported in part by the u.s .",
