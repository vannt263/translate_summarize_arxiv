    "goldstone and pseudo  goldstone bosons play a large role in the speculations of particle physicists and cosmologists .",
    "some oft  discussed examples are axions,@xmath0 majorons,@xmath1 familons,@xmath2 and the non  abelian goldstone fields of texture models.@xmath3 the salient feature of the dynamics of goldstone bosons is that they couple derivatively .",
    "if the associated global continuous symmetry is broken at a scale @xmath4 , then the coupling always involves powers of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the goldstone boson .",
    "the consequence of this is that if @xmath4 is very large compared to the relevant masses and momenta , the goldstone boson decouples .",
    "this fact is exploited in invisible axion models,@xmath7 where for @xmath8 the axion s couplings are small enough for it to have evaded detection and avoided conflict with astrophysical observations.@xmath9 this fact also lies behind the well  known `` axion energy problem'',@xmath10 which is that if @xmath11 the energy in coherent oscillations of the axion field after the qcd phase transition in the early universe is unable to dissipate due to the axion s weak coupling and eventually overcloses the universe .    in this letter",
    "we show that different goldstone fields can mix with each other through kinetic terms in the lagrangian in a way reminiscent of photon ",
    "paraphoton mixing,@xmath12 and that a goldstone boson can thus acquire effective couplings at low energy to certain fields which are much larger than the typical @xmath13 . after demonstrating this point we show how it makes possible scenarios in which the energy in coherent oscillations of the cosmological axion field can be dissipated and the upper limit on @xmath14 removed .",
    "consider a theory with a global symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be two scalar fields with charges ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) under this symmetry .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is assumed to be much smaller than @xmath14 , and call the resulting goldstone modes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , ` @xmath21 ' and ` @xmath6 ' respectively .",
    "then it is clear that couplings of @xmath21 will be suppressed by @xmath22 and those of @xmath6 by @xmath23 .",
    "it can happen that by integrating out some fields of mass @xmath24 an effective higher dimension operator will result of the @xmath15invariant form @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are substituted into this expression , the result contains the term @xmath28 with @xmath29 through this mixing of @xmath21 and @xmath6 , the ` axion ' @xmath21 can couple to particles which have @xmath30 charges with effective strength @xmath31 , which can be much greater than @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    for example , a term such as in eq . ( 1 ) could arise from integrating out a field @xmath32 , with charges @xmath33 , mass @xmath24 , and coupling @xmath34 $ ] . for simplicity let @xmath32 have positive mass - squared and no vev .",
    "then the loop shown in fig .",
    "2 will produce the following effective term ( among others ) for momenta less than @xmath24 : @xmath35 and therefore , from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath36 now , given that the term @xmath37 exists , it would require an artificial cancellation for @xmath38 to be much less than @xmath39 , and hence for @xmath40 to be much larger than @xmath41 .",
    "there is also an absolute limit that @xmath42 , since the kinetic terms of @xmath21 and @xmath6 have the form @xmath43 and a wrong  sign metric would otherwise result .",
    "there is no reason , however , why @xmath40 can not be of order , though less than , unity .    if the higher dimension term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) were a `` hard '' term all the way up to momenta of order @xmath14 , then the theory would become strongly coupled and physics uncalculable unless @xmath38 were @xmath44 and hence @xmath40 were less than about @xmath45 . the effective coupling of @xmath21 to particles with @xmath30 charges through mixing then would be of order @xmath46 . in other words , the coupling of @xmath21 would not be enhanced by this mixing . if , on the other hand , the term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) arises through a loop such as that shown in fig . 2 where the intermediate particles have mass @xmath47 , then it softens for momenta above @xmath24 and no problem arises in higher order .",
    "we wish to make use of the mixing of goldstone bosons to let axions couple strongly to some other particles and thus , somehow , allow the primordial energy density in axions to be dissipated .",
    "let the field @xmath21 be the axion that solves the strong cp problem .",
    "then @xmath48 has a qcd anomaly and @xmath21 gets a mass of order @xmath49 from instanton effects .",
    "several astrophysical arguments@xmath9 suggest that @xmath50 , otherwise the evolution of stars or their remnants would be drastically different than observed .",
    "thus the coupling of the axion to ordinary matter , which is proportional to @xmath51 , is highly suppressed .",
    "the axion energy crisis arises as a result of the small coupling and the small mass of the axion . at temperatures above the qcd phase transition",
    "the axion mass is small enough that @xmath52 .",
    "as the universe cools , @xmath53 increases until the axion field becomes dynamic ,  @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the expansion rate .",
    "barring a coincidence of alignment for the peccei - quinn angle , the initial value of the axion field is @xmath56 .",
    "the axion number density is then @xmath57 .",
    "after that point the number of axions in a comoving volume is constant , while the axion mass increases from @xmath55 to its zero temperature value @xmath58 . if the energy density of axions after the qcd phase transition exceeds a critical value , @xmath59 , then the the universe would become matter dominated too early ,  at temperatures @xmath60 .",
    "the energy density in axions at @xmath61 is roughly @xmath62 , which results in the constraint @xmath63 . in non - inflationary models there",
    "are bound to be axionic strings - whose decay may@xmath64 or may not@xmath65 increase the axion abundance 100-fold , lowering the cosmological bound to @xmath66",
    ".    there have been several approaches to solving the axion energy crisis .",
    "for example , entropy production@xmath67 may dilute the energy density in axions relative to ordinary matter , or inflation may fix the initial value of the peccei - quinn angle to a suitably small value@xmath68 .",
    "however , attempts to dissipate the axion energy typically fail .",
    "direct axion absorption presents several challenges .",
    "first , the goldstone boson nature of axions demands a factor of @xmath51 at each vertex .",
    "second , since the axions to be absorbed are non - relativistic the derivative couplings demand an additional factor of @xmath53 at each vertex .",
    "third , any process for single axion absorption must admit axion emission in the time reversed channel .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the dissipation rate by a factor of @xmath69 from a naive approach that would ignore the back reactions .",
    "flynn and randall@xmath70 considered the non - derivative coupling of axions to mesons@xmath71 , but the first and third arguments above were sufficient to leave axions undamped by several orders of magnitude .    in the present case ,",
    "the mixing of axions with some other goldstone boson allows the possibility of coupling axions strongly to some other non - standard matter .",
    "however , without some explicit symmetry breaking of the @xmath30 , the axions must couple derivatively .",
    "the combination of powers of @xmath53 from the couplings and from consideration of back reactions has caused all our attempts at axion absorption to fail .",
    "nonetheless , there is a mechanism whereby axion oscillations can be damped , allowing for @xmath14 of order the grand unified scale @xmath72 , or even the planck scale @xmath73 .",
    "let the axion be mixed , as described above , with strength @xmath40 with a goldstone boson @xmath6 arising from the breaking of @xmath30 .",
    "the axion coupling to ` @xmath6matter ' , as we will call it , will be vastly stronger than its coupling to ordinary matter .",
    "our basic idea is then that the oscillating axion field causes the energies of @xmath6-particles to change in energy .",
    "if a thermal bath of such @xmath6-particles were present in the early universe when the axion field started to oscillate , then those oscillations would drive the @xmath6-distribution out of thermal equilibrium . by adjusting the interaction rates of the @xmath6-particles to a suitable value",
    "the axion energy can be dissipated into thermal energy of @xmath6 particles .",
    "the final step is to note that the @xmath6 goldstone boson is massless , so that all @xmath6 energy can in principle redshift away as radiation .",
    "the axion energy is thus put into a harmless form which never dominates the universe .",
    "to illustrate how this may happen let us calculate in a simple model in which the ` @xmath6matter ' consists of the field @xmath17 whose vacuum expectation value breaks @xmath30 and whose phase is @xmath6 , and a scalar field @xmath74 which has no vev .",
    "let the @xmath30 charges of @xmath17 and @xmath74 both be @xmath75 and let them have a coupling @xmath76 .",
    "the terms of the lagrangian that will be relevant for our analysis are @xmath77 the last term arises from expanding @xmath17 as @xmath78 in the @xmath79 coupling and defining @xmath80 . at this point",
    "we are free to choose the parameters of @xmath81 . for purposes of illustration",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath82 and to choose @xmath83 somewhat less than @xmath84 .",
    "these values are not absolutely necessary , but they clearly show the damping mechanism to work .    the first task is to resolve the mixing of @xmath21 and @xmath6 . to bring the kinetic terms of @xmath21 and @xmath6 to canonical form",
    "we perform a non  orthogonal transformation @xmath85 this gives @xmath86    at this point it is convenient to drop the primes and work with the canonically normalized fields . for further convenience",
    "we represent the coherent oscillation of the axion field by @xmath87 then the effective lagrangian for @xmath74 in the presence of axion oscillations becomes @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "it is important to note that even though @xmath90 is slowly varying ( with frequency @xmath53 ) , @xmath91 is rapidly varying : @xmath92 . since @xmath93 ( initially ) , @xmath94 . for time scales short compared to @xmath95 we may treat @xmath96 as being constant and write @xmath81 as @xmath97~.\\ ] ]    the problem now is to find the evolution of the @xmath74 field , a non - trivial task because of the explicit time dependence .",
    "this is done in the appendix , but we give a simplified version here .",
    "first , if @xmath98 then for each momentum @xmath99 there would be two degenerate eigenstates . one could choose to work in a basis with linearly polarized or with circularly polarized states .",
    "with degenerate states it is easy to show that the hamiltonian is constant for any linear combination .",
    "next , consider the case @xmath100 , but @xmath101 .",
    "then the two eigenstates have masses @xmath102 , and correspond to the linearly polarized states along the real and imaginary components of @xmath74 ;  they are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "now , there is no explicit time dependence so the hamiltonian is still constant .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by writing the hamiltonian in terms of the linearly polarized states and observing that there is no mixing of different frequency states in the hamiltonian . finally , for non ",
    "zero @xmath96 , the hamiltonian is time dependent and the energy of the @xmath74 field varies with time .",
    "for @xmath106 small the evolution is well approximated by the @xmath107 eigenstates , but there is a qualitative difference between the linearly polarized and circularly polarized solutions .    for the linearly polarized case ,",
    "the potential in the @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) direction has a curvature that varies sinusoidally in time : @xmath110 .",
    "since we will assume @xmath111 , the variation in @xmath112 is adiabatic . in that case one",
    "expects each quantum to have energy @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "the number of quanta of oscillation is an adiabatic invariant .    on the other hand , for the circularly polarized case , the state samples the potential at all phases of @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath115 , this averaging takes place in a time small compared to the evolution of the potential and there is little time dependence in the energy . in the appendix",
    "we show that , in fact , the true eigenmodes are approximately circularly polarized .",
    "there is no time dependence for pure states ; however , in a thermal bath we do not expect pure states unless there is some conserved quantum number .",
    "the corresponding symmetry in our case is the @xmath6 symmetry , which is broken , so that @xmath6 charge is not conserved .",
    "we therefore expect all polarizations to play a role , and having identified the linearly polarized states as having an energy dependence driven by the axion field we look for dissipation of the axion energy through those modes .",
    "time variation of the energy levels of the @xmath74 field can lead to dissipation .",
    "suppose the rate at which a linearly polarized @xmath74 particle of momentum @xmath99 scatters is given by @xmath116 .",
    "then the occupation number @xmath117 , of that state will obey the differential equation @xmath118\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the equilibrium occupation number ( bose  einstein ) .",
    "treating @xmath121 as small , this has solution @xmath122 where @xmath123 and tan@xmath124 .",
    "the occupation numbers thus ` lag ' by a phase @xmath125 behind the equilibrium value as that oscillates in time . as @xmath126 , this lag goes to zero and @xmath127 ; the system remains in equilibrium . as @xmath128",
    ", the interactions turn off and there is no time variation of @xmath129 .",
    "maximum dissipation occurs for @xmath130 .",
    "the average power dissipated over a period @xmath131by the mode with momentum @xmath99 is given by @xmath132 or @xmath133 the total power dissipated per unit volume is then given by @xmath134 { { \\mu^4}\\over { 8 \\omz^2 t}}~.\\ ] ] the factor @xmath135 comes from averaging over all possible polarizations of the @xmath74 particles .",
    "equating the dissipation power with the change in axion energy density , @xmath136 , and using @xmath137 , the energy in coherent axion oscillations evolves as @xmath138 where @xmath139 , with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "let us now make the approximation that whatever dissipation occurs takes place in less than an expansion period - so that the functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 may be approximated as constant . then , taking the integral @xmath144 , the final axion energy density is @xmath145 this solution embodies a number of special cases , but we are mostly interested in the cases where we can treat @xmath146 as small .",
    "then , the axion density decreases exponentially during one expansion time .",
    "given that the maximum initial value of @xmath147 is approximately @xmath148 , as long as @xmath149 , the axion density will be reduced to acceptable levels .",
    "we take the temperature to be about @xmath150 .",
    "dissipation is fastest if @xmath20 is small . on the other hand , if @xmath151",
    ", the @xmath30 symmetry will be unbroken and the axion will have no goldstone boson , @xmath6 , to mix with , and this dissipation mechanism will not operate .",
    "so the greatest dissipation should exist for @xmath152 , and @xmath153 on the other hand , the dissipation cuts off for @xmath154 .",
    "so the energy in the axion field can not be reduced below @xmath155 by this mechanism . demanding that this be less than @xmath156 in order to comfortably solve the axion energy problem gives @xmath157 , and from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , @xmath158 .",
    "these two constraints can easily be satisfied , for example by @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "we have established that it is possible to dissipate the primordial energy density in axions through their interactions with other particles .",
    "a key feature of the process we envision is to mix the axion with some other goldstone boson @xmath6 , whose decay constant @xmath20 is much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "the mixing may be large , and this allow axions to couple strongly to ` @xmath6 matter ' . by adjusting the matter content of the @xmath6-sector we can arrange for the axion oscillations to drive oscillations in the energy of @xmath6 matter .",
    "this pushes the @xmath6 matter out of thermal equilibrium , and ultimately allows the axion energy density to dissipate in the @xmath6-sector .",
    "although , we have constructed a model whereby the axions dissipate , the addition of new particles may have other troublesome consequences , chief of which is that @xmath6 matter may itself come to dominate the universe . the easiest way to avoid",
    "this is to adjust the masses and couplings of the @xmath6-sector so the real part of the @xmath17 field is the lightest @xmath6-particle other than the @xmath6 goldstone boson itself .",
    "then as the universe cools , first all @xmath6 matter will end up as @xmath162 s which will then decay with a rate of order @xmath20 into @xmath6 goldstone bosons .",
    "we argued earlier that it is difficult to dissipate axion energy through the process of single axion absorption , yet , in the present scenario axion energy is indeed absorbed .",
    "it is natural to ask if there is a `` feynman diagram '' explanation of our process .",
    "the answer is yes . imagine a process whereby a single axion is absorbed from the coherent state , as in fig .",
    "( 3a ) and a second process whereby two axions are absorbed , as in fig .",
    "the ratio of the rates for these two processes is @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the occupation number for the state .",
    "as stated earlier the effective single axion absorption rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath165 when back reactions are included . however",
    ", this is also true of the two axion absorption rate , and so the ratio in eq .",
    "( 21 ) is correct even in the presence of backreactions .",
    "now , for the coherent state , @xmath164 is approximated by @xmath166 , so the ratio becomes @xmath167 , which is quite large .",
    "this leads to the situtation that two axion absorption formally exceeds one axion absorption .",
    "the three axion rate would be even larger ... in this situation what one must do is sum over diagrams with any number of axions attached to the particles participating in the scattering process .",
    "this is equivalent to solving for the propagator of these particles in the presence of the coherent oscillating axion field , as we have done in this paper .",
    "along these lines , even in a normal axion model with no mixing each additional axion brings a factor of @xmath168 to the amplitude , so here also one should not calculate individual absorption rates .",
    "rather , one should calculate the propagators for the other particles , including the time dependent axion field , to arrive at the axion dissipation rate .",
    "we are presently considering the question of what dissipation may result from the non - derivative couplings to mesons , and plan to present results in a separate paper .",
    "although derivative couplings may seem important too , one must remember that such couplings are less effective at damping the non - relativistic coherent axion oscillations due to the factor of @xmath53 in the coupling .    besides damping the coherent oscillations in the early universe",
    ", the kind of mixing of axions with other goldstone bosons we have been discussing could lead to other interesting effects .",
    "in particular , it is possible now to contemplate that even invisible axions with @xmath169 or @xmath73 can have sizable couplings to some kinds of matter , perhaps even to particles that carry standard model gauge charges .",
    "this would mean that the `` invisible axion '' may not be quite as invisible as was thought .    also worth further investigation",
    "is whether similar mixing in familiar majoron , familon or texture models could lead to interesting phenomena .",
    "the easiest way to find the eigenstates of the lagrangian in eq .  ( 11 ) is to make the field redefinition @xmath170 , after which the lagrangian becomes @xmath171 the equations of motion for @xmath172 are @xmath173 the solutions to these equations are @xmath174 where the index @xmath175 denotes one of four solutions for a given wave vector @xmath99 . due to the mixing of @xmath176 and @xmath177 , to simultaneously solve both equations of motion requires that @xmath178 be either pure real or pure imaginary , but otherwise the normalization amplitude is arbitrary .",
    "the positive eigenfrequencies are given by @xmath179^{1/2}\\right]^{1/2 } ~.\\ ] ] negative frequency solutions for momentum @xmath99 are equivalent to positive frequency solutions with momentum @xmath180 , and so are not distinct . for the case",
    "when @xmath178 is real , the mixings are given by @xmath181 for the case where @xmath178 is imaginary , the sign of @xmath182 is changed .    counting @xmath183 , and the real and imaginary @xmath178 ,",
    "there are eight eigenfunctions combining the wavenumbers @xmath184 and @xmath185 , which is the right number to determine the field and its first time derivative at each point ; so this is a complete set of states for the @xmath176 field .    for the @xmath74 field ,",
    "the states are given by @xmath186 .",
    "we can choose any four of the eight eigenstates to characterize the momentum @xmath184 ( using the other four for @xmath185 ) .",
    "it seems natural to chose a set where @xmath187 as @xmath188 ,",
    "since in that limit we must get back the free field theory for @xmath74 . with this in mind , the general solution that we will associate with momentum @xmath184 is @xmath189 where the @xmath190 are real numbers and where @xmath191~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath192^{1/2}\\right]^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta_{ss^\\prime } & \\equiv & { { \\omz^2+s^\\prime \\mu^2 -(q- \\omega_s)^2}\\over { 4q \\omega_s}}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath193 , which is the limit taken in the text , eqs .",

    "<S> by coupling axions strongly to a hidden sector , the energy density in coherent axions may be converted to radiative degrees of freedom , alleviating the `` axion energy crisis '' . </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling is achieved by mixing the axion and some other goldstone boson through their kinetic energy terms , in a manner reminiscent of paraphoton models . even with the strong coupling it proves difficult to relax the axion energy density through particle absorption , due to the derivative nature of goldstone boson couplings and the effect of back reactions on the evolution of the axion number density . </S>",
    "<S> however , the distribution of other particle species in the hidden sector will be driven from equilibrium by the axion field oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> restoration of thermal equilibrium results in energy being transferred from the axions to massless particles , where it can redshift harmlessly without causing any cosmological problems .    ' '' ''    # 1#1 # 1#1    # 1  # 1 # </S>",
