    "it has been the subject of the largest chemical ( see e.g. norris & da costa 1995 , norris , freeman & mighell 1996 , suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) and kinematical investigations ( see e.g. merritt , meylan & mayor 1997 , van leeuwen et al .",
    "2000 ) ever attempted on a globular cluster .",
    "the global picture emerging from these surveys is that this is the only galactic globular cluster showing an undoubted spread of metallicity , with a major distribution peak at @xmath7}\\simeq -1.6 $ ] and a long , extended tail up to @xmath7}\\simeq -0.5 $ ] , possibly with a second , smaller peak at @xmath7}\\simeq -1.2 $ ] .",
    "the more metal - rich stellar component seems also more centrally concentrated and kinematically cooler than the metal - poor one ( norris et al .",
    "besides , while the latter has a well defined systemic rotation , the former shows no evidence of it ( norris et al .",
    "1997 ) , somewhat in contrast with a simple , dissipative formation scenario .",
    "the detailed chemical composition of @xmath8  centauri giants is even more complex and puzzling .",
    "the overall over - abundance of @xmath9-elements with respect to the sun indicates a primordial enrichment by type  ii supernovae ( sne ) with massive progenitors .",
    "the observed enhancement of s - process elements ( see e.g. lloyd evans 1983 , smith , cunha & lambert 1995 , smith et al . 2000 , vanture , wallerstein & suntzeff 2002 ) towards higher metallicities suggests a more extended period of primordial enrichment ( possibly as long as a few gyrs ) provided by agb stars of intermediate - low mass . concerning the cno group elements , while the carbon depletion and nitrogen enhancement shown by the bulk of metal - poor stars ( norris & da costa 1995 ) can be easily explained with evolutionary mixing effects along the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the carbon and nitrogen over - abundances observed in some co / cn - strong stars ( bessel & norris 1976 , persson et al .",
    "1980 ) have been suggested to be of primordial origin ( norris & da costa 1995 , hilker & richtler 2000 ) , indicating once again an interstellar medium pollution by agb stars . in order to explain such over - abundances of s - process and cn elements ,",
    "a self - enrichment scenario can be invoked , where the products released by intermediate mass agb stars not only pollute the interstellar medium but can be also accreted onto the atmospheres of lower mass cluster stars during their main - sequence and/or sub - giant branch evolution ( see e.g. the recent works by ventura et al .",

    "in particular , our photometric survey ( pancino et al . 2000 ) of more than 220,000 stars over a @xmath10 field of view , allows to identify a distinct rgb sequence ( rgb - a ) , previously unknown , to the red side of the main cluster sequence .",
    "six of these _ anomalous _ rgb - a stars are co - identified in the norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) spectroscopic sample : all of them are clear cluster members , the most metal - rich ones having also strong baii ( lloyd evans 1983 ) and cn lines ( hilker & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "our photometric analysis indicates that , within the complex structure of the @xmath0  centauri rgb , three major sub - populations can be distinguished , the largest being metal - poor ( rgb - mp ) , one moderately populated at intermediate metallicity ( rgb - mint ) and the _ anomalous _ , metal rich sequence ( rgb - a ) which accounts for @xmath11 of the whole stellar content of the cluster .",
    "the rgb - mint and the rgb - a also show different spatial distributions compared to the bulk of metal poor stars ( see pancino et al .",
    "2000 and reference therein ) .",
    "as part of a large - project ( ferraro , pancino & bellazzini 2002a ) devoted to study the origin and evolution of the complex stellar population in this peculiar cluster , we are also undertaking a spectroscopic survey both in the visual and in the near - infrared ( ir ) , in order to trace the detailed abundance patterns of the @xmath9 , cno group and s - process elements of the _ anomalous _ , metal - rich sub - population , as done in the past years for the more metal - poor counterparts .",
    "23 giants in @xmath0  centauri , belonging to both the rgb - a and the control sample of the _ normal _ , more metal - poor populations , have been recently observed at high resolution with uves at vlt ( paranal , chile ) . a first sample of six stars ( 3 rgb - a and 3 rgb - mint ) has been already analyzed ( pancino et al .",
    "2002 ) , providing accurate fe , cu , ca and si abundances .",
    "the most metal - rich stars have [ fe / h]@xmath12 and are less @xmath3-enhanced than the stars at intermediate metallicity .",
    "this result is the first evidence that the _ anomalous _ , metal - rich rgb - a population formed in a medium significantly polluted by type  ia sne , hence with a substantial different history of chemical enrichment compared to the one of the _ normal _ population .    in this metal - rich regime",

    "a complementary survey in the near ir has been also performed : we secured a set of medium resolution ir spectra of bright giants , spanning the whole range of metallicities of @xmath0  centauri .",
    "ir spectroscopy is indeed a crucial tool to study the cool stellar systems , since the ir spectral range is intrinsically more sensitive to low temperatures compared to the visual one , and also reddening corrections , blanketing effects and background contamination by main - sequence stars are much less severe , allowing to properly characterize the red stellar sequences also in metal - rich and crowded environments .",

    "the neutral , atomic lines in the j and h bands are heavily saturated ( lying on the damping part of the curve of growth ) and somewhat less sensitive to element abundance variations , with respect to the molecular lines .",

    "the equivalent widths have been measured by performing a gaussian fit to the line profile , typical values ranging between 100 and 1000 m , with a conservative error of @xmath20150  m   which implies an average uncertainty in the resulting abundances of @xmath10.2 - 0.3  dex .",

    "three main sources of uncertainty can affect the derived elemental abundances , namely the errors in the equivalent width measurements , the uncertainty in the stellar parameter assumptions and in the overall fitting procedure .    in order to better quantify the impact of the errors in the equivalent width measurements on the inferred abundances we computed the curves of growth for the neutral atoms .",

    "the change in the inferred element abundances is always @xmath240.2 dex ( see also origlia et al .",
    "2002 for a more exhaustive discussion ) .",
    "moreover , the simultaneous synthesis of all the atomic and molecular lines , which have a different sensitivity to the various stellar parameters , puts more stringent constraints on the best - fit solution , making the latter more robust . as shown in fig .",
    "4 ( top panels ) , models with @xmath200.2  dex variation of the elemental abundances with respect to the best - fit solution generate quite different line profiles , even at low - medium resolution , particularly in the case of the molecular lines which are not saturated and hence more sensitive to the element abundance .",
    "while fitting observed spectra with synthetic models , it can be also useful to quantify the goodness of the fits in a statistical way .",
    "the adopted process of best fitting is performed by varying the elemental abundances in the synthetic spectrum until the best match with the observed features is found .",
    "synthetic spectra with slightly lower elemental abundances should be _ systematically _ shallower than the best - fit solution , while the opposite occurs when higher abundances are adopted . to take full advantage of these _ systematic _ differences , as a statistical function of merit we adopt the difference between the model and the observed spectrum ( @xmath29 , hereafter @xmath30 , for brevity ) .",
    "when the best - fit solution is adopted , @xmath31 should be @xmath32 .",

    "this parameter is more powerful than the classical @xmath35 test , which is instead equally sensitive to _ random _ and _ systematic _ scatters .",

    "we then extract 10000 random subsamples from each _ test model _",
    "( assuming a gaussian distribution ) and we compute the probability @xmath38 that a random realization of the data - points around a _ test model _ display a @xmath31 that is compatible with the _ best - fit _ model .",
    "@xmath39 indicates that the model is a good representation of the observed spectrum .    as an example of the application of such a statistical test , the lower panels of fig .",
    "4 show the results for the three portions of the wfi246325 stellar spectrum shown in the corresponding upper panels .",

    "with the present infrared spectroscopic survey we have been able to measure the abundances of key metals like iron , carbon , oxygen and other @xmath9-elements in the full range of metallicities ( see table  1 ) .",
    "carbon and oxygen abundances are inferred from the co ( @xmath42 ) and oh ( @xmath43 ) molecular lines in the h ( 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath14 m ) band , while fe , mg , si and ca abundances are derived from a few major neutral lines both in the j and h bands .",
    "these elements play a crucial role in disentangling evolutionary mixing effects and primordial enrichment , a fundamental step to answer some more general - and still pending - questions regarding the global picture of the formation and evolution of this enigmatic globular cluster .",

    "type  i sne should indeed explode in a lower gas density medium compared to type  ii sne and their winds can be more efficient in removing their processed material ( see e.g. recchi , matteucci & dercole 2001 ) , somewhat delaying or slowing down the overall iron enrichment of the interstellar medium .    the evidence of a significant decrease of the [ @xmath9/fe ] over - abundance in the most metal - rich population of @xmath8  centauri , as shown in this paper ( see also pancino et al .",
    "2002 ) , conversely suggests that the gas from which it formed should have been enriched in iron by type  ia sne . within the simple picture of pure self - enrichment",
    ", this would also imply some age spread ( @xmath55  gyr ) among the different populations , as indeed suggested by some authors ( hilker & richtler 2000 , hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) .",

    ", stars undergo a deepening of the convective envelope , dredging up ( the so - called _ first dredge - up _ mixing process ) the cn - processed material and mixing it with the one in the outer layers of the stellar atmospheres ( see e.g. charbonnel 1994 and reference therein ) . in low - mass stars the _ first dredge - up _ should occur at the base of the rgb and , as a consequence of such a mixing , models predict a decrease of @xmath5c and an increase of @xmath4c and @xmath57n abundances , by amounts which mainly depend on the chemical composition and the extent of the convective zone",
    ". however , many sets of observations ( see e.g. suntzeff & smith 1991 , shetrone 1996 , gratton et al . 2000 and references therein ) on low mass field and cluster giants provide quite different isotopic abundance ratios compared to those predicted by standard models . in particular , much lower @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratios compared to those expected from the _ first dredge - up _ are inferred , suggesting that some other non - standard mixing mechanisms should be at work during the ascent of the rgb ( see e.g. charbonnel 1995 , denissenkov & weiss 1996 , cavallo , sweigart & bell 1998 and references therein ) . as a consequence of these additional mixing mechanisms ,",
    "the material from the convective envelope is first brought down to the hotter region where it undergoes further nuclear processing ( the so - called _ cool bottom processing _ ) , and then it is transported back up to the convective envelope .",
    "an accurate abundance determination of the cno - group elements is then crucial to constrain the mixing processes in the stellar interiors .",
    "boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) computed cno isotopic abundances for different stellar masses and metallicities after the first dredge - up and the _ cool bottom processing_. in the range of metallicities covered by our sample of bright ( l / l@xmath58100 ) giants in @xmath0  centauri , the _ first dredge - up _ mixing models for a solar mass star predict a modest ( @xmath59  dex ) [ c / fe ] depletion and a @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratio of @xmath4840 .",
    "the _ cool bottom processing _ models predict a further decrease of the [ c / fe ] and @xmath4c/@xmath5c relative abundances , with a somewhat larger depletion at lower metallicities . however , as shown in fig .  7 , in the range of metallicities under consideration , the [ c / fe ] ratio is poorly suitable to trace possible extra - mixing effects , being the overall carbon depletion within a factor of 2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratio is extremely sensitive , being further depleted by one order of magnitude after the _ cool bottom processing_.    all the spectroscopic measurements of the isotopic carbon abundances in @xmath0  centauri have shown very low @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratios ( @xmath6010 ) , without any obvious trend with metallicity .",
    "a comparison with boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) mixing models suggests that such values can not be explained by the canonical _ first dredge - up _ mixing , but further _ cool bottom processing _ is required . in the past years somewhat different algorithms and/or physical scenarios have been proposed to compute _ cool bottom processing _ models ( see weiss , denissenkov & charbonnel 2000 for a review ) .",
    "although a solid physical picture describing the deep mixing processes and the detailed evolution of the different abundance patterns is still lacking and matter of debate , all models agree on the fact that the low @xmath4c/@xmath5c values as observed in the bright giants of @xmath0  centauri are undoubted signatures of extra - mixing occurred in the stellar interiors during the evolution along the rgb .",
    "a spectroscopic screening of the multi - populations of red giants in @xmath8  centauri has been performed by analyzing medium resolution infrared spectra of 21 bright stars .",
    "the major results can be summarized as follow . + _",
    "i ) _   the existence of three major metallicity regimes , namely metal - poor at [ fe / h]=@xmath610.2 dex , intermediate at [ fe / h]=@xmath450.2  dex and metal - rich at [ fe / h]@xmath2 has been confirmed .",
    "+ _ ii ) _   the metal - poor and intermediate metallicity populations show @xmath9-enhancement , tracing a major enrichment of the interstellar medium by type  ii supernovae on a relatively short time - scale , before the onset of type  ia supernovae .",
    "+ _ iii ) _   the _ anomalous _ , metal - rich population is significantly less @xmath9-enhanced than the main body of the cluster , indicating a major iron pollution of the interstellar medium by type  ia supernova ejecta on longer timescales .",
    "+ _ iv ) _   the overall metallicity spread and the different degree of @xmath3-enhancement between the _ normal _ , metal poor and the _ anomalous _ , metal - rich populations suggests a rather complex chemical evolution history , possibly characterized by self - enrichment and implying a more continuum star formation process as well as some age spread .",
