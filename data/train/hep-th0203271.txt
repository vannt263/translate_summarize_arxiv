    "in the present letter we would like to report results on the free propagators of fermions and gauge fields in a brane model where penetration and radiation into an infinitely large transverse dimension is suppressed by bulk mass terms .",
    "after the pioneering work of dvali , gabadadze and porrati on the emergence of an interpolating gravitational potential between four and five dimensions in a model with einstein ",
    "hilbert terms both on a brane and in the bulk @xcite , dvali , gabadadze and shifman have shown that a similar interpolating static potential exists for gauge fields with both brane and bulk kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "a generic feature of these models is the prediction that the four - dimensional potentials are realized at length scales well below a transition scale @xmath0 beyond which the five - dimensional distance laws become dominant . in gaussian normal",
    "coordinates around a 3-brane @xmath1 the relevant lagrangians can be combined into[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mean extrinsic curvature scalar on the brane @xcite : @xmath4.\\ ] ] @xmath5 is the intrinsic curvature scalar on the brane , and the lagrangian @xmath6 accounts for scalar and fermionic matter degrees of freedom on the brane . if one starts from the bulk terms the model can be motivated by radiative generation of kinetic terms on the brane due to self energy contributions from brane modes @xcite .",

    "the off brane gravitational potential @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of special functions using @xmath13 ( [ eq : udgp ] ) yields four - dimensional gravity at short distances and five - dimensional gravity at large distances @xmath14 @xmath15,\\ ] ] @xmath16 @xmath17,\\ ] ] with the transition scale @xmath18    the presence of the higher - dimensional terms in the weak field limit of the einstein equation for @xmath19 causes the modification in the numerical factor between the reduced four - dimensional planck mass @xmath20 and newton s constant to @xmath21 @xcite .    the coulomb potential on the brane is @xmath22,\\ ] ] which corresponds to a transition scale @xmath23 between four - dimensional behavior at short distances and five - dimensional behavior at large distances @xcite .",
    "a further attractive feature of the dgp model is that it allows for an implementation of standard friedmann cosmology on the brane symmetric cosmology in the dgp brane model , where friedmann cosmology can be realized approximately . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the motivation for the present work was twofold : on the one hand we were seeking a corresponding model for fermions with both brane and bulk terms , and on the other hand we wanted to understand the impact of a bulk mass term for the gauge fields in this class of large extra dimension models .",
    "massless bulk gravitons can be acceptable due to their extremely weak coupling and the great difficulties of observing gravitational waves , but for photons the time - dependent propagator following from ( [ eq : actiondg ] ) would imply unacceptable radiation loss into the transverse dimension from dynamical sources on the brane .",
    "dynamical binding mechanisms of matter and gravity to submanifolds as a feature of solitonic solutions or as a consequence of couplings to solitonic backgrounds @xcite has been discussed well before the recent formulation of brane models in terms of dimensionally hybrid action principles .",
    "one possibility is to think of the models discussed here as effective descriptions of underlying binding mechanisms e.g.  in string inspired brane models . of course",
    ", this may not be the only possibility in which actions like ( [ eq : actiondg ] ) or ( [ eq : actiona],[eq : actionpsi ] ) below may arise .",
    "we consider the impact of a bulk photon mass in sec .",
    "[ sec : photon ] and bulk fermion masses in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermion ] .",
    "with brane sources and a bulk mass term the action for photons on and off the brane becomes @xmath24 the source terms @xmath25 on the brane are assumed to satisfy a conservation law @xmath26    there are two mass scales in the problem : @xmath27 determines the relative weight of the bulk and brane contributions , and from the results of @xcite we know that small @xmath27 corresponds to a large transition length @xmath28 to five - dimensional behavior of the static coulomb potential .",
    "however , for @xmath29 and time - dependent brane sources we would find radiation leaking into the bulk also at length scales much smaller than @xmath28 , and therefore the bulk photon mass term has been included to suppress missing energy from radiation loss .",
    "the equations of motion @xmath30 split into @xmath31 and @xmath32    @xmath33 should be symmetric across the brane and decouples from the sources .",
    "we set it to zero in the sequel . to determine the potentials @xmath34 for the electromagnetic fields generated by the currents on the brane we have to solve @xmath35 the fourier _ ansatz _ @xmath36\\ ] ] yields @xmath37 which implies the following form for the green s function @xmath38 with @xmath39 we then find for @xmath40 , i.e.below the threshold set by the bulk photon mass : @xmath41 @xmath42 and above the threshold @xmath43",
    "@xmath44    for @xmath45",
    "we find the ordinary 4-dimensional potential @xmath46 below the bulk photon threshold . for @xmath47",
    "we find @xmath48 .",
    "this is correct , since @xmath49 describes the potentials generated from brane sources , and in the limit @xmath47 the electromagnetic fields decouple from the brane sources .",
    "if we want to calculate the fields from bulk sources residing on the brane we would have to rescale the source terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq : greena ] ) by @xmath27 , which of course amounts to a rescaling of @xmath49 by the same factor .",
    "the limit @xmath50 yields exactly the usual 5-dimensional potentials , as expected .",
    "to formulate a dimensionally hybrid action principle for fermions we can take e.g.   @xmath51 .",
    "the formulation of the action principle introduces again a bulk fermion mass and an extra mass scale @xmath27 : @xmath52 the corresponding equation for the free fermion propagator for sources on the brane is @xmath53 and with @xmath54\\ ] ] we find @xmath55 this determines the @xmath56-dependence of the propagator @xmath57 and @xmath58 is then determined from ( [ eq : conds ] ) by taking into account @xmath59 at low energies @xmath60 this yields again exponential damping in the transverse direction : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 while above the threshold for bulk fermions we have @xmath65 @xmath66.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the fermion propagators have the usual hermiticity properties @xmath67 @xmath68 and the expected 4-dimensional and 5-dimensional limiting behavior : @xmath69 is the usual 5-dimensional fermion propagator , and below the bulk fermion threshold we have @xmath70",
    "the dimensionally hybrid action principles ( [ eq : actiona],[eq : actionpsi ] ) yield propagators which interpolate between genuine four - dimensional propagators at small distances @xmath71 and five - dimensional propagators at large distances @xmath72 .",
    "however , suppression of radiation into the bulk requires bulk masses @xmath73 , and as a consequence of that the four - dimensional behavior actually persists only in an energy range @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , the bulk mass shifts the pole of the photon propagator @xmath75 also in the four - dimensional regime to @xmath76 that this corresponds to the generation of a photon mass in four dimensions may not be as obvious as in a genuine four - dimensional propagator , since the pole appears as a simple algebraic pole only in an expansion of the denominator in @xmath77 around @xmath78 , and also the integration to @xmath79 is not straightforward .",
    "the corresponding mass shift for massive fields ( [ eq : slowe2 ] ) is of much less significance , since generically it will provide only a small shift of @xmath83 : in leading order in @xmath27 the shift of a mass @xmath84 is @xmath85    the current upper bound on a photon mass is @xcite @xmath86 no significant missing energy events have been found in accelerator searches up to @xmath87tev .",
    "therefore bulk photon masses in the class of brane models discussed here must certainly exceed @xmath88tev .",
    "this translates into a bound on the transition scale to five - dimensional behavior @xmath89 which exceeds the size of our hubble horizon by a factor @xmath90 : in those brane models where photon localization is dynamical and can effectively be described by a bulk mass term , laboratory constraints on brane and bulk photon masses are more restrictive than constraints from large scale observations of four - dimensional distance laws .",
