    "in the final paper of this series , referred to as paper iv , we compare our monte carlo reaction rates to previously derived results . in paper",
    "i we point out that previously reported ( or  classical \" ) reaction rates have a different meaning from our monte carlo rates .",
    "the latter are presented in paper ii and are subject to a straightforward statistical interpretation , while the former are statistically meaningless .",
    "consequently , one has to be very careful when comparing such qualitatively and quantitatively different results . since we did not want to complicate the discussion in paper ii by comparing",
    " apples with oranges \" , we avoided so far a comparison between present and previous reaction rates .    on the other hand , we realize that for practical purposes many readers are precisely interested in such a comparison : by how much did a particular reaction rate change ? how accurate was a previous reaction rate ?",
    "does a given rate used in a particular stellar model need updating or not ? how significant is this new monte carlo method compared to classical techniques of computing thermonuclear reaction rates ? in order to answer these questions , we present a comparison of our new rates with previous results .",
    "section 2 provides a few useful comments .",
    "a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "3 . results are presented in graphical form in the appendix , together with information on how to interpret the figures .",
    "the comparison of monte carlo with classical reaction rates is presented in graphical form in the appendix . for each reaction",
    "considered , two types of graphs are presented .",
    "the first shows the change in reaction rate uncertainties , while the second graph displays the new results normalized to the previously recommended reaction rate .",
    "detailed information on how to interpret the graphs is also given in the appendix .",
    "generally , the previous results used for the comparison are adopted from the latest reference that lists recommended reaction rates and , if available , associated uncertainties in _ tabular form_. this reference is provided after each rate comparison figure . most of the previous reaction rates are adopted from angulo et al .",
    "@xcite or iliadis et al .",
    "for some reactions , newer rates have been presented in the literature , but in graphical form only . in such cases we requested ( and obtained ) from the original authors the numerical reaction rates used to produce the literature plots .",
    "visual inspection of the graphs reveals that for almost all reactions our new thermonuclear rates differ substantially from previous results .",
    "the changes are caused both by our new monte carlo method of computing reaction rates ( see paper i of this series ) , and by newly available nuclear physics information ( see paper iii of this series ) .",
    "we did not analyze in detail for each reaction the sources of a rate change at a given temperature .",
    "such a comprehensive analysis would require considerably more efforts in computing time and manpower .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that many readers may find the graphs presented here useful for a variety of purposes .",
