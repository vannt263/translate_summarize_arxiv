    "following the discovery of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite , it is of more interest to search for new high - mass particles , such as additional higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "recently , in the @xmath6 mass spectrum , a resonance around the mass @xmath7  gev/@xmath8 is seen with a significance of about @xmath9  @xcite . in the sm and many beyond - sm theories ,",
    "the coupling of the higgs boson and the fermions is proportional to the mass of the fermion . for a neutral higgs boson , @xmath10 ,",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath11 would be dominant compared to other leptons @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "experimentally , the presence of neutrinos makes it challenging to reconstruct the invariant mass @xmath14 accurately .",
    "accordingly , the performance of mass reconstruction technique affects the sensitivity of probing new physics .",
    "there are a few techniques of @xmath14 reconstruction that are commonly used in the hadron colliders .",
    "the study of these techniques can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here is a short summary .    1 .",
    "the transverse mass method ( tmm ) : @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the 4-momenta of the visible decay products of the tau leptons ; @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the @xmath20 component of the missing energy .",
    "this method assumes that only the neutrinos from the tau decays contribute to the missing transverse energy .",
    "we call it the `` missing transverse energy assumption '' ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is not able to consider the @xmath22 component of the momentum of the missing neutrinos .",
    "the resulting @xmath14 spectrum is thus biased and broadened .",
    "2 .   the collinear approximation technique ( cat )",
    ": it is based on the @xmath21 .",
    "it also assumes that the neutrinos from each tau decay are collinear with the visible tau decay products , the charged leptons or the hadronical @xmath1 jets .",
    "thus the 4-momenta of the neutrinos can be fully determined .",
    "@xmath24 are the momentum fractions carried by the visible tau decay products .",
    "the explicit expressions are written below .",
    "@xmath25 here @xmath26 is the magnitude of the momentum of the visible tau decay products ; @xmath27 ; and @xmath28 are the azimuthal angles of the visible tau decay products and the missing energy in the plane perpendicular to the beam line .",
    "this method gives a reasonable mass resolution , but it fails if the visible tau decay products are outgoing back - to - back ( thus @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "it has an efficiency lose 40%-60% .",
    "3 .   the missing mass calculator technique ( mmct ) :",
    "it is also based on the @xmath21 .",
    "the unknown quantities are the 4-momenta of the invisible neutrinos , denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( 6 - 8 unknown parameters in total depending on the decay type of the tau lepton ) .",
    "but there are only four constraints , written in eq .",
    "[ eq : mmc ] . for each event , the method is to calculate all possible @xmath14 values satisfying the constraints .",

    "they are determined by mc simulations .",
    "the method has an efficiency up to @xmath38 and gives a mass resolution better than that of the cat .",
