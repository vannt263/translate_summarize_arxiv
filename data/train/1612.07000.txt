    "the active galactic nuclei known as  blazars \" include flat - spectrum radio quasars and bl lac objects .",
    "they show strong flux variability over all the electromagnetic spectrum , high and variable polarization , superluminal motion of the radio knots , brightness temperatures exceeding the compton limit .",
    "these properties are explained by assuming that blazar emission comes from a plasma jet oriented close to the line of sight , implying relativistic beaming of the radiation @xcite .",
    "this is produced by synchrotron and likely inverse - compton processes at low and high energies , respectively @xcite .",
    "the source pg 1553 + 113 is a high - energy peaked bl lac object ( hbl ) , which means that its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shows a synchrotron bump extending from the radio to the x - rays , and an inverse - compton bump from x - rays to tev energies .",
    "for these sources , the inverse - compton radiation is usually assumed to originate from the scattering of synchrotron photons by the same relativistic electrons that produce the synchrotron emission ( ssc models ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the redshift of pg 1553 + 113 has been investigated in several ways , but has not been firmly established yet .",
    "constraints derived from the analysis of the intergalactic absorption features set it in the range @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "lower limits to the redshift were also obtained from spectroscopy , @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "studies of the very - high - energy ( vhe , @xmath3 ) spectrum suggested @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the source has recently gained particular attention because of the @xmath7 year quasi - periodicity of its flares @xcite and because of its possible association with neutrino signals detected by icecube ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sed modelling has produced different results .",
    "@xcite obtained satisfactory fits to the broad - band source sed , from the radio to the vhe band , with a one - zone ssc model where the energy distribution of the electrons producing the synchrotron radiation is modeled by a three - component power law .",
    "different source states were accounted for by only changing the parameters determining this law , while @xcite had to fine - tune six parameters to explain the noticeable sed variations .",
    "a one - zone ssc model was also applied to the broad - band sed observed during the 2012 flaring state by @xcite .    in 2013 the whole earth blazar telescope ( webt ) coordinated a multiwavelength campaign on pg  1553 + 113 in support of magic observations .",
    "the results of the webt radio - to - optical monitoring were presented in @xcite and used together with observations by _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ to analyse the source synchrotron emission .",
    "the picture that emerged was enigmatic , because the connection between the uv and x - ray spectra seemed to require a double curvature .",
    "possible interpretations were discussed , favouring variations of the viewing angle of the jet emitting regions , whose effects were tested with an inhomogeneous ssc helical jet model @xcite .",
    "different sed shapes corresponding to various brightness states were matched by changing only three parameters defining the jet geometry .    in 2015 ,",
    "nearly 218 hours of _ xmm - newton _ observing time on pg  1553 + 113 were awarded to investigate the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ; e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at the same time",
    ", this offered an extraordinary opportunity to study in detail the emission of the blazar itself and , in particular , the problem of the spectral connection between the uv and x - ray regions discussed by @xcite . to maximize the scientific output ,",

    "we present the results of the six _ xmm - newton _ guest - observer ( go ) pointings at pg 1553 + 113 in 2015 ( section 2 ) , together with those of the _ swift _ observations ( section 3 ) and webt continuous monitoring ( section 4 ) in the same period .",

    "we show the result of the log - parabolic fit to the joint om and epic data of each epoch , together with that of the sixth _ xmm - newton _ pointing ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "while in the first five epochs the joint om+epic fits overproduce the webt data ( radio+near - infrared in the first two cases , radio only in the other three ) , the fit obtained in the sixth epoch also matches the contemporaneous radio data and suggests that the synchrotron peak lies in the near - uv band .",
    "it is also consistent with the broad - band sed of the fifth pointing , while slightly overproduces the x - ray flux of the other epochs and slightly underproduces the uv flux of the first one .    in fig .",
    "[ sed_fab6 ] we compare this log - parabolic model with the fits to a high , intermediate , and low x - ray state of the source obtained by @xcite with an inhomogeneous ssc helical jet model @xcite .",
    "the 2015 uv - to - x - ray flux is in between those characterizing the intermediate and low states , and the x - ray spectrum appears softer , while the radio flux is higher .",
    "we also show a realization of the same jet model that can satisfactorily reproduce the sed of 2015 august 30 september 1 . with respect to the @xcite fits ,",
    "it was obtained by changing the three parameters defining the jet orientation , and by lowering the emitted minimum and maximum frequencies at the jet apex .",

    "[ sed_fab6 ] we added the wise data downloaded from the allwise source catalog .",
    "although the wise data are not contemporaneous with the other data , they suggest a power - law shape of the sed in that wavelength range , more in agreement with the jet model .    in conclusion , the 2015 seds indicate an intermediate uv - to - x - ray state as compared to those analysed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the smaller curvature of the uv and x - ray spectra in 2015 allows for a better connection between the uv and x - ray spectra , so that in first approximation a simple log - parabolic fit appears suitable to describe at least the seds with the highest x - ray fluxes .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis requires a more complex model , like the inhomogeneous ssc helical jet model that has already been applied to previous , more problematic seds of this source .",

    "figure [ zoom ] shows an enlargement of the period including the _ xmm - newton _ pointings examined in this paper and the corresponding webt campaign .",
    "a prominent flare was detected in the x - ray band at the very end of 2014very beginning of 2015 , which was characterised by a rapid fall and was followed by a minor flare .",
    "the ratio between the maximum and the minimum flux is @xmath33 .",
    "the decreasing part of the x - ray major flare was observed also in the optical band , where it was probably more contained . the maximum observed flux density in the @xmath16 band was only @xmath34 times higher than the minimum in 2015 .",
    "the optical counterpart of the x - ray second , minor flare appears to be more extended in time .",
    "optical polarimetric data were acquired at the crimean , lulin , skinakas , and st .",
    "petersburg observatories .",
    "two points with large error ( @xmath35 ) were removed . the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ambiguity on the evpa was treated by minimizing the difference between adjacent points .",
    "the value of @xmath32 rapidly oscillates between @xmath38 and @xmath39 in a way that does not appear to be correlated with the optical ( see also fig .",
    "[ permag ] ) or x - ray brightness behaviour .",
    "the first polarimetric datum in 2015 , when the source flux was still high , does not reveal particularly high polarization .",
    "instead , @xmath32 reached the highest values in 2014 , when the flux was rather stable and relatively low .",
    "the evpa is quite variable too .",
    "it increases during all the 2014 observing season and makes a rotation of 350  in about six months , with a mean rate of @xmath40/month , while it remains more or less stable after the major flare .",
    "notice however that the jump at jd=2456794 is @xmath41 , i.e.  very close to @xmath42 .",
    "therefore at that epoch the evpa minimizing procedure sets the rotation counter - clockwise ( increasing evpa ) instead of clockwise ( decreasing evpa ) because of a difference of a few degrees only .",
    "this is of the same order of the overall error on the two data points defining the evpa jump .",
    "the opposite choice would produce a smaller total rotation and rate , about 230  in 4.8 months , i.e.  @xmath43/month ambiguity see also @xcite . ] .",
    "figure [ zoom ] allows us to identify other , smaller rotations of the evpa corresponding to different behaviours of polarization degree and optical flux .",
    "in particular , a nearly 60  change of evpa was observed in about ten days , between jd=2457231 and 2457241 , with @xmath32 reaching a minimum at the rotation inversion point and the optical flux density remaining in a steadily decreasing phase and achieving a minimum just after @xmath32 .    the mojave project obtained two vlba polarization measurements at 15 ghz in the period we are considering , yielding radio evpas of 49  on 2014 january 11 and 22  on 2014 december 12 .",

    "the position angle of the structure of the radio source estimated from the mojave data is about @xmath45 , so the radio evpas are nearly transverse to the jet axis .",
    "in this paper we focussed on two main issues regarding the spectral and polarimetric behaviour of the hbl pg  1553 + 113 .",
    "in @xcite we found a disagreement between the seds built with _",
    "swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ data acquired at a short time distance ( about 6 weeks ) in 2013 .",
    "the uvot spectra showed a pronounced curvature , with a steep uv spectrum whose extrapolation to higher energies did not meet the soft xrt spectrum . on the contrary ,",
    "the optical  uv spectrum obtained from the om data was flat and the connection with the epic spectrum was less puzzling . to better clarify the matter , in @xcite we compared the 2013 data with previous _",
    "swift _ , iue and hst - cos observations , confirming the uv spectrum steepness showed by the uvot data .",
    "we then fitted the various radio - to - x - ray seds with an inhomogeneous ssc helical jet model @xcite , where different x - ray brightness states and spectral shapes are reproduced by changing only three parameters defining the jet geometry and orientation .",
    "the 2015 seds analysed in this paper found the source in an intermediate uv - to - x - ray brightness state with respect to those discussed by @xcite .",
    "they show a consistency within the uncertainties between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ data and smaller optical  uv and x - ray spectral curvatures .",
    "the two x - ray brightest seds are reproduced reasonably well by the simple log - parabolic model that best fits the om and epic data together , while a possibly better fit is still obtained with the helical jet model .",
    "further _ xmm - newton _ long exposures on pg  1553 + 113 are planned in 2017 when , according to the quasi - periodic behaviour claimed by @xcite , the source will be in outburst",
    ". it will be interesting then to study in detail its spectral variability during the high flux state and compare it with the results obtained in this paper relative to a low flux state .",
    "as for the polarimetric behaviour , the major point is the interpretation of the ample evpa rotation observed in 2014 .",
    "this is also shown in the @xmath12 versus @xmath46 plot in fig .",

    ", @xcite could explain large evpa rotations correlated with flux flares , while @xcite analysed the competition between the shock speed and the magnetization in the emission region and found that in a moderately magnetized environment a fast shock can produce a 180  rotation with only a modest flux increase .",
    "the time scale of the rotation is about a couple of weeks .",
    "evpa swings from emitting blobs propagating on curved trajectories have been investigated by @xcite .",
    "the maximum rotation rate occurs when the viewing angle is minimum , which implies a minimum in @xmath32 and a maximum in flux .",
    "@xcite satisfactorily fitted the photopolarimetric behaviour of 0716 + 714 during the 2011 outburst with a model involving the propagation of a shock in a helical jet , which produces a steplike rotation of the evpa .",
    "three wide evpa rotations in different directions were observed by @xcite when analysing the polarimetric behaviour of pks @xmath49 in early 2012 .",
    "they ascribed this behaviour to turbulence .",
    "the possibility that evpa rotations are produced by a stochastic process , because of the random walk of the polarization vector due to a turbulent magnetic field , was investigated by e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they found that wide rotations can be obtained , but they are rare , so it is unlikely that all those observed are produced by this mechanism .",
    "moreover , stochastic and deterministic processes can both be responsible for different events in the same source .",
    "the extremely wide evpa rotation of pg 1553 + 113 in 2014 is similar to that observed in the source @xmath48 by @xcite , though on a different time scale .",
    "there is a general increase , whose finer structure reveals a series of plateaux linked by abrupt jumps .",
    "the degree of polarization shows a ( possibly double ) minimum during the rotation that is much wider than 180 , and the flux density does not show any flare .",
    "this questions most of the proposed deterministic models .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that a single emission contribution is responsible for both flux and polarization variability .",
    "therefore , following the suggestions by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we assumed that some amount of magnetic turbulence is at work in the optical emitting region and we ran monte carlo simulations to see whether we can reproduce a photopolarimetric behaviour resembling that shown in fig .",
    "we considered the daily binned @xmath16-band light curve made by photopolarimetric data and assumed that the observed flux is equally contributed by @xmath50 emitting cells with randomly oriented magnetic field .",
    "these cells have uniform magnetic field with degree of polarization corresponding to synchrotron radiation from particles with a power - law distribution of energies with index @xmath51 : @xmath52 for @xmath53 . at each time step ,",
    "the flux density is fixed by the observed value , while a number of randomly chosen cells , @xmath54 , change the orientation of their magnetic field .",
    "this number is crucial to obtain a certain level of ordered behaviour .",
    "we set their minimum number to @xmath55 and increased them proportionally to the length of the time step @xmath56 .",
    "the overall values of @xmath32 and evpa at each epoch can be derived from the stokes parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the whole emitting region , which are obtained by summing the @xmath59 and @xmath60 parameters of all cells .",
    "we could obtain a variety of different behaviours , with @xmath32 values statistically close to the observed ones ( @xmath61 ) and sometimes leading to wide evpa rotations .",

    "the new seds presented in this paper show less curvature in both the optical  uv and x - ray spectra , and an intermediate uv  x - ray flux , as compared to those analysed by @xcite . as a consequence , at least the two seds corresponding to the brightest x - ray states are satisfactorily reproduced by the simple log - parabolic model that best fits the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "however , the helical jet model is still possibly giving a better fit .",
    "we have also analysed the optical polarimetric behaviour of the source over the last three years , along with the x - ray and optical photometric behaviour .",
    "we did not find any clear correlation between the polarization degree and the optical brightness .",
    "the evpa showed an almost complete counter - clockwise rotation in 2014 . in the same period",
    "the degree of polarization was very variable and the optical ( and possibly the x - ray ) flux was rather stable . all together , these pieces of information make an interpretation in terms of simple deterministic emission models quite difficult , while they are more easily explained by a stochastic model that assumes some turbulence of the magnetic field in the jet emitting region .",
    "this is in line with the results of @xcite and @xcite , who found that evpa rotations in high - synchrotron - peaked sources are less frequent than in low - peaked ones and suggested that probably the former are mostly random walk rotations while the latter are due to deterministic processes .",
