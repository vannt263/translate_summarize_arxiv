    "continuous variable * cv * quantum teleportation  @xcite , depends on the use of a two mode quantum entangled resource and in general allows only the reconstruction of an imperfect output state .",
    "it has been shown that the success probability of teleportation can be increased by using entangled non - gaussian resources which can be chosen to improve the efficiency of the protocol  @xcite . in particular for a specific family of two - mode non - gaussian states , the squeezed bell - like states which include photon - added and photon- subtracted states it has been shown that fidelity between input and output states can be improved by carefully choosing the parameters of the resource  @xcite .",
    "for high squeezing squeezed bell - like states tend to @xmath2 states and teleportation becomes perfect .",
    "other classes of non - gaussian resources , such as two - mode squeezed symmetric superpositions of fock states and of squeezed cat - like states , with good performance in the teleportation of single - mode input states were considered in  @xcite .    in general , teleportation success",
    "is increased by maximizing a functional of the density matrices of the output and the input states , such as the fidelity  @xcite , over modifications of the resource and the teleportation protocol .",
    "a more general approach may be considered since on one side fidelity is not directly observable except for input states that are eigenstates of an observable quantity and in the other any verifying process for the output of teleportation will consist in a series of measurements on the output and the input states .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to study how to optimize the transmission of observable averages and/or observable statistics in an output state and to compare such optimal transmission situations with optimal fidelity situations . for specific experimental situations , the preservation of observable averages and associated variances may be in principle of more interest than the overall fidelity .",

    "the distortion of the teleported state in * cv * depends on the transfer function .",
    "the transfer function of an state approaching the * epr * state is nearly constant , being close to the value @xmath24 at each point of the one - mode phase space .",
    "thus the limit epr state is not square - integrable  @xcite . from equation  ( [ eq : cvtelepoutoneg ] ) it is seen that with a state approximating an * epr * state as a resource the output state is nearly identical to the input state .      for a particular",
