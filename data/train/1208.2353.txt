    "@xcite however , whereas the resistivity of a magnetically doped metal increases when the temperature is lowered below the kondo temperature , @xmath5 , in quantum dots ( qds ) the linear conductance increases and eventually reaches its maximum value @xmath6 at zero temperature . @xcite this is due to the enhancement of the scattering rate which results in the opening of a channel for electrons that are perfectly transmitted through the qd .",
    "the main advantage of exploring the spin-@xmath7 kondo effect in manufactured nanostructures such as qds @xcite is their high tunability . using gate electrodes it is possible to vary in a controllable manner the number of trapped electrons and the strength of tunnel coupling between the reservoirs and the localized dot states .",
    "furthermore , as an additional advantage , we mention that qds constitute perfect laboratories to test many - body effects under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "@xcite the influence of external fields such as finite bias voltages , @xcite or time varying ac fields @xcite allows the observation of the kondo effect out of equilibrium .",
    "remarkably , magnetic fields dramatically affect the kondo state , even at equilibrium conditions .",
    "the level degeneracy , required for the formation of the usual spin-@xmath7 kondo effect , is lifted in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "there are , however , some exceptions where a magnetic field facilitates the development of a kondo state , for example in vertical qds with an even number of electrons . here , the integer - spin kondo effect occurs when the singlet and triplet states become degenerate because of the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite therefore , in general , magnetic fields either remove the kondo effect or facilitate its observation through the level degeneracy requirement .",
    "the fabrication of more complex nanostructures has opened new possibilities for the study of unconventional kondo effect .",
    "there exists a great variety of artificially fabricated systems exhibiting exotic kinds of the kondo effect : to mention just a few , nanodevices based on carbon materials like fullerenes , carbon nanotubes , and graphene .",

    "each dot is connected to two contacts in such a way that the tunneling events conserve the flavor degree of freedom .",
    "notice that in principle , this setup can be easily generalized to build an arbitrary @xmath15 kondo state @xcite although that would entail designing a device with equal capacitive coupling between all qd pairs .",
    "importantly , the only interaction among the dots is capacitative and there is no particle exchange from one dot to the others , i.e. , the interdot tunneling is not allowed since this would destroy the flavor conservation rule .",
    "the recent progress in fabricating highly tunable tqds @xcite aims to provide a platform for testing a variety of predicted novel quantum information processing functionalities and many - body effects .",

    "we also study the effect of local perturbations on the @xmath11 singlet kondo state such as asymmetrical lead - dot couplings , finite interdot tunneling rates , non - equal charging energies , etc .",
    "generally , these perturbations destroy the @xmath11 singlet kondo state , however , we propose a way to restore the kondo resonance by properly gating the dot levels .    in order to investigate in a general framework the different regimes encountered for the the tqd system we consider the operators of the @xmath11 lie algebra which describe the orbital ( flavor ) degree of freedom of the electrons .",
    "the thermodynamics analysis is performed by calculating the impurity orbital ( flavor ) susceptibility @xmath16 , and the impurity entropy @xmath17 .",

    "away from the particle - hole symmetric point _ , contrary to what happens in the more familiar @xmath18 ) and @xmath9 kondo cases where at half filling the kondo effect is present .",
    "consequently , the kondo peak itself is not symmetric with respect to the chemical potential as visible in the spectral densities for each dot .",
    "these values of the occupancy have important consequences for the linear conductance . in accordance with the friedel - langreth sum rule , the linear conductance is @xmath19 where the scattering phase shift @xmath20 is approximately given by @xmath21 ; here @xmath22 is the total tqd occupation and @xmath23 , while @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 ( note that we are considering a spinless system , thus the spin factor 2 is not present in @xmath24 ) .",
