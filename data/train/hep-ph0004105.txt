    "in the last few years there has been another wave of excitement regarding the question of neutrino masses .",
    "this is largely due to the many new experiments testing neutrino oscillations , most notably the positive indications obtained by super kamiokande on atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "similar indications come from other experiments @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino experiments have for many years provided independent evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "accelerator and reactor experiments have also played an important role . they have furnished strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . in the case of the lsnd experiment @xcite at los alamos evidence for @xmath2 oscillation has been reported .",
    "see refs @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "it is hoped that new experimental results can be used to determine the neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles . in turn , these may help to infer the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this is presumably a possible gateway to a more fundamental theory beyond the standard model .",
    "of course this is a highly speculative area , and even though there are many imaginative proposals @xcite , it seems fair to say that the the true answer is essentially unknown . in order to make progress in this direction",
    ", it seems useful to investigate various plausible ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix . from this point of view",
    "we propose the ansatz for the 3 generation neutrino mass matrix , @xmath3 : @xmath4 and investigate its consequences .",
    "we are considering the neutrinos to be represented by 2-component spinors so that , in the most general situation , @xmath3 is an arbitrary symmetric complex matrix .    as we will see in section ii , eq . ( 1.1 ) can be motivated from an so(10 ) grand unified model @xcite , in which it may be derived with some assumptions . physically , eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) corresponds to the well known approximate signature of grand unification that @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore we will see in sections iv and v that eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) can be straightforwardly combined with experimental information to get an idea of the neutrino masses themselves as well as the `` texture '' of @xmath6 .",
    "relevant matters of notation are discussed in section iii while a summary is presented in section vi .",
    "in the so(10 ) grand unification model each generation contains one light massive two component neutrino and also a very heavy one which is `` integrated out '' according to the `` seesaw mechanism '' @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath7 neutrino mass matrix takes the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the mass matrices of the light neutrinos , heavy neutrinos and heavy - light mixing ( or `` dirac matrix '' ) . generally the second , seesaw , term",
    "is considered to dominate . here",
    "however we shall assume the first term to be the dominant one .",
    "this is necessary for the present derivation of eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) to hold .",
    "also , a rough order of magnitude estimate for the second term would be @xmath12 or about @xmath13 ev . thus , the seesaw term could be negligible if neutrino masses turn out to be appreciably larger than this value .",
    "now in so(10 ) , higgs mesons belonging to the 10 , 120 and 126 representations can contribute to the fermion masses at tree level .",
    "one has @xcite for the down quark , charged lepton and light neutrino mass matrices , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are numbers representing higgs meson vacuum values .",
    "s(10 ) , a(120 ) and s(126 ) are the matrices of the yukawa type constants which couple the fermions to the 10 , 120 and 126 higgs mesons respectively ; the matrices s(10 ) and s(126 ) must be symmetric while a(120 ) is antisymmetric .",
    "finally , @xmath20 is a renormalization factor for comparing the quark masses with the charged lepton masses at a low energy scale rather than at the grand unified scale ; @xmath21 is a similar factor for the neutrino masses . with the stated assumption that the @xmath22 term dominates in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) we get @xmath23 which clearly also holds when any number of 10 s or 120 s are present but only a single 126 .",
    "the matrices appearing in eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) are so far essentially unrestricted complex ones .",
    "to proceed , we make the further assumption that the matrices are hermitian .",
    "then @xmath24 and @xmath25 may each be brought to diagonal form by unitary transformations .",
    "thus the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) may be evaluated to yield approximately , @xmath26 according to a well known numerical success , based on the observation that @xmath27 , of grand unification @xcite . note that we have not needed to assume that the mass matrix has any zero elements .",
    "where , in addition , a special combined fritzsch - stech ansatz was used .",
    "here we are not making any special ansatz of this type for the mass matrices . ] even if the cancellation on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) is not perfect , it should still be a good approximation .",
    "in an so(10 ) model where the mass matrices are hermitian , @xmath28 will be real symmetric .",
    "we will investigate this case and also the possibility that the more general case holds .",
    "our plan is to combine the ansatz eq . ( 1.1 ) with experimentally obtained results on neutrino oscillations in order to learn more about @xmath29 itself . for this purpose",
    "it may be helpful to set down our notation @xcite for the pieces of the effective @xmath30 theory involving neutrinos and to make some related remarks .",
    "the free lagrangian containing three two component massive fields is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ( not yet diagonalized ) neutrino mass matrix of the underlying theory to be identified with the matrix in eq .",
    "note that we are free to multiply the first mass term in eq .",
    "( [ lfree ] ) by an overall arbitrary phase which is a matter of convention .",
    "it is possible@xcite to find a unitary matrix @xmath33 which brings @xmath0 to real , positive , diagonal form in the following way : @xmath34 the mass diagonal fields @xmath35 are then @xmath36 similarly , the column vector of left handed negatively charged leptons in the underlying theory , @xmath37 is related to the mass diagonal fields @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 .    combining factors from eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) and eq . ( 3.4 ) we obtain the unitary mixing matrix , @xmath41 for the charged current weak interaction , @xmath42 this appears in the lagrangian term , @xmath43 where a conventional four component dirac notation with @xmath44 diagonal is being employed and @xmath35 has only the first two components non zero .",
    "next we parameterize @xmath41@xcite .",
    "it is possible to restrict @xmath45 by adjusting an overall phase which can be absorbed in @xmath46 .",
    "then we write @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 and , for example @xmath50 .",

    "( 3.7 ) contains the eight parameters needed to characterize an arbitrary unitary unimodular matrix . from the standpoint of eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) it can be further simplified by using the freedom to rephase @xmath51 without changing the free part of the charged lepton lagrangian . on the other hand , the form of the mass terms in eq .",
    "( [ lfree ] ) shows that the neutrino fields can not be rephased .",
    "thus a suitable minimal parameterization for @xmath41 in ( 3.6 ) is @xmath52 involving three  angles \" , @xmath53 and three  phases \" , @xmath54 .",
    "note the identity @xmath55 this identity may be used to transfer two of the phases @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) to a diagonal matrix on the right of @xmath41 as , for example , @xmath56 where @xmath57 , which may be used instead of eq . ( 3.10 ) .",
    "we also need the formula for the amplitude of neutrino oscillation . for the case",
    "when a neutrino , produced by a charged lepton of type @xmath15 ,  oscillates \" to make at time @xmath58 , a charged lepton of type @xmath16 , we have @xmath59 where the sum goes over the neutrinos of definite mass , @xmath60 . inserting the parameterization eq .",
    "( 3.12 ) into eq .",
    "( 3.13 ) shows that the effect of the factor @xmath61 cancels out .",
    "thus for ordinary oscillations , @xmath41 is parameterized by three angles and one cp violating phase as for the ckm quark mixing matrix . on the other hand",
    ", the two additional cp violating phases @xmath62 and @xmath63 show up if one considers neutrino - antineutrino oscillations @xcite or neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",
    "the formula for the probability , @xmath64 is gotten by taking the squared magnitude of eq .",
    "( 3.13 ) and replacing the exponential factor @xmath65 by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the neutrino energy and @xmath68 is the oscillation distance . for practical reasons",
    "it is very important to take account of the experimental uncertainties in @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the simplest approximation@xcite is to define @xmath69 and assume that one can smear @xmath64 with a gaussian distribution in @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath70 is defined as the mean value and @xmath71 as the standard deviation appropriate to the particular physical setup .",

    "notice that when @xmath75 , @xmath76 is independent of the sign of @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 provides only two real equations for 12 real parameters , it is clear that it has a relatively small amount of predictivity .",
    "in particular it can not say much about the texture ( e.g. possible zeroes ) of @xmath0 which is suppposed to derive from a deeper theory than the standard model . on the other hand",
    ", we shall see that our ansatz is complementary to the results which should emerge from analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "together , they should enable us to actually ( with some conditions ) reconstruct @xmath0 .",
    "first , in this section , we shall consider @xmath0 to be hermitian so that the argument in favor of @xmath78 presented in section ii holds without any further assumptions .",
    "since @xmath0 is symmetric it must be real .",
    "it can be brought to real diagonal form via a real rotation @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "however there is no guarantee that all eigenvalues of @xmath0 will be positive .",
    "we can make them all positive by rephasing the diagonal fields with negative eigenvalues by a factor @xmath81 ( see eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) ) .",
    "this means that the general diagonalizing matrix @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) now takes the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 with @xmath84 for a positive eigenvalue and @xmath85 for a negative eigenvalue .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) is of the form eq .",
    "( 3.12 ) for which we already noticed that the factor @xmath86 cancels out in the neutrino oscillation formula eq . ( 3.14 ) .",
    "furthermore only the square of the mass is relevant in eq . ( 3.14 ) .",
    "thus we choose to work in this section with some negative masses and no factor @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) .    to avoid confusion , we remark that the factor @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) does _ not _ introduce any cp violation in the theory @xcite since @xmath0 is real in any event .",
    "now let us suppose that an experimental analysis of all neutrino oscillation experiments is made based on a formula like eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) ( or one which treats the experimental uncertainties in a more sophisticated way ) .",
    "furthermore assume that the cp violating phase @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( 3.12 ) is negligible .",
    "then we should know the _",
    "magnitudes _ of the squared neutrino mass differences @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be either positive or negative . then , assuming the leptonic theory to be cp conserving , our ansatz would imply @xmath91 where eq . (",

    "\\nonumber m_3 & = & - m_1 - m_2 .",
    "\\label{4.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this leads to a limited number of solutions , depending on sign choices .",
    "if we make the further assumption that the charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) is approximately the unit matrix ( this is expected to be a reasonable but not perfect approximation ) we can identify @xmath97 which would be obtained from experiment .",
    "then , using the masses found in eq .",
    "( 4.4 ) , we could reconstruct @xmath0 as @xmath98    to proceed , we need only insert the experimental results for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath41 in ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) . of course , it is presumably the task of the next decade to solidify the experimental determination of these quantities .",
    "we can , at the moment , only give a preliminary discussion .",
    "for this purpose we will use the results of a recent preliminary analysis of all neutrino experiments by ohlsson and snellman @xcite .",
    "these authors found , by a least square analysis , a best fit for ( our notation ) @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath41 .",
    "they used the formula eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) with a suitable choice of @xmath70 and @xmath101 for each experiment .",
    "furthermore , they made the simplifying assumption that @xmath41 is real .",
    "finally they only searched for a fit in the range @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "this range corresponds to mass difference choices for which the msw effect @xcite for solar and atmospheric neutrinos is not expected to be important and so greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "thus there is no guarantee that the solution of @xcite is unique .",
    "altogether they fit sixteen different solar neutrino , atmospheric neutrino , accelerator and reactor experiments , including lsnd .",
    "the best fit is : @xmath104 for the squared mass differences and @xmath105 \\label{4.7}\\ ] ] for the lepton mixing matrix @xmath41 .",
    "as discussed above we will identify @xmath106 here , keeping @xmath41 real but allowing for negative masses .",
    "the best fit matrix k was obtained to be similar but not identical to the `` bimaximal mixing '' matrix @xcite .    with the best fit squared mass differences in eq .",
    "( 4.6 ) , our model predicts , from the first of eq . ( 4.4 ) , eight different possibilities .",
    "these correspond to four different sign configurations for @xmath89 and @xmath90 times the two possible signs for @xmath92 .",
    "however , only two of these eight are essentially different ; these are @xmath107 the other solutions correspond to interchanging whichever of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is greater ( which has only a negligible effect since they are almost degenerate ) or reversing the signs of all masses .",
    "physically it is clear what is happening : the smallness of @xmath110 compared to @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) forces @xmath112 .",
    "then we have either @xmath113 with , using the constraint eq .",
    "( 4.3 ) , @xmath114 or @xmath115 with @xmath94 very small .",
    "since we have assumed the neutrinos to be of majorana type for our plausibility argument in section ii , their interactions will violate lepton number",
    ". then they should mediate neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "such a process has not yet been observed and an upper bound has been set for the relevant quantity @xmath117 the best upper bound at present is @xcite @xmath118 ev , reflecting some uncertainty in the estimation of the needed nuclear matrix elements .    substituting the best fit for the matrix k from eq .",
    "( 4.7 ) together with our results in eqs . ( 4.8 ) and ( 4.9 ) into eq . ( 4.10 ) yields predictions for the two cases : @xmath119 both solutions seem to be acceptable , the type i case marginally but the type ii case definitely .",
    "note that the small value for @xmath120 in the type ii case is due to the best fit prediction @xcite @xmath121 and also to the fact that @xmath93 is negative . the same value would clearly result if we made @xmath93 positive and set @xmath122 as discussed around eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) above .",
    "finally , let us reconstruct the underlying neutrino mass matrices for each of the two cases .",

    "however the small value of @xmath124 in the type ii case is certainly suggestive .",

    "it will be interesting to see if either of them hold up in the future .    incidentally , on comparing eqs .",
    "( 4.13 ) and ( 4.14 ) it is amusing to observe the large difference in two mass matrices `` generated '' in the same way except with respect to how @xmath125 is satisfied .",
    "it seems interesting to also investigate the ansatz @xmath126 when @xmath0 is no longer restricted to be real .",
    "this also raises the problem of constructing the unitary diagonalizing matrix @xmath33 in eq.(3.2 ) , in terms of the experimentally measured lepton mixing matrix @xmath127 . for simplicity , as",
    "before , we will make the approximation that the charged lepton diagonalizing matrix @xmath96 is the unit matrix .    apart from an overall ( conventional ) phase we may write @xmath128 where the 2-parameter quantity @xmath129 was defined in eq . (",
