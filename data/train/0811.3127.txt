    "quantum phase transitions @xcite of a quantum many - body system are characterized by the change in the ground - state properties caused by modifications in the interactions among the system s constituents .",
    "contrary to thermal phase transitions where the temperature plays a crucial role , quantum phase transitions are completely driven by quantum fluctuations and are incarnated via the non - analytic behavior of the ground - state properties as the system s hamiltonian @xmath0 varies across a transition point @xmath1 .    from the point view of eigenenergy ,",
    "quantum phase transitions are caused by the reconstruction of the hamiltonian s energy spectra , especially of the low - lying excitation spectra @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the low - energy spectra can be reconstructed in two qualitatively different ways around the critical point @xmath2 , and hence the physical quantities show different behaviors .",
    "the first one is the ground - state level - crossing in which the first derivative of the ground - state energy with respect to @xmath3 is usually discontinuous at the transition point .",
    "such a transition is called the first - order phase transition .",
    "the second one corresponds roughly to all other cases in the absence of the ground - state level - crossing .",
    "it is usually a continuous phase transition .",
    "traditionally , continuous phase transitions can be characterized by the landau - ginzburg - wilson spontaneous symmetry - breaking theory where the correlation function of local order parameters plays a crucial role .",
    "nevertheless , some systems can not be described in this framework built on the local order parameter .",
    "this might be due to the absence of preexistent symmetry in the hamiltonian , such as systems undergoing topological phase transitions @xcite and beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transitions @xcite .      in recent years",
    ", ambitions on quantum computer and other quantum information devices have driven many people to develop quantum information theory nielsen1 .",
    "though a practicable quantum computer seems still a dream , progresses in quantum information theory have developed other related fields forward .",
    "a noticeable one is the relation between quantum entanglement and quantum phase transitions aosterloh2002,tjosbornee , gvidal03,sqsu2006,hdchen10215,sjguxxz , sjguxxz2,sjguprl , larsson_ent , ssdeng06,ychen07,sjgucpl , pdsacramento07 . since the entanglement is regarded as a purely quantum correlation and",
    "is absent in classical systems , people think that the entanglement should play an important role in quantum phase transitions .",
    "though a unified theory on the role of entanglement in quantum phase transitions is still unavailable , some definitive conclusions have been commonly accepted @xcite .",
    "another attractive approach is the quantum fidelity auhlmann76,palberti83,pmalberti831,pmalberti832,wkwootters81,rjozsa94,bschumacher95,cafuchs , bures , rastegin , jlchen02,tgorinprep , mendonca , xwang08071781 , a concept also emerging in quantum information theory",
    ". the fidelity measures the similarity between two states , while quantum phase transitions are intuitively accompanied by an abrupt change in the structure of the ground - state wavefunction , this primary observation motivates people to explore the role of fidelity in quantum phase transitions htquan2006,zanardi06 . since the fidelity is purely a quantum information concept , where no _ a priori _ knowledge of any order parameter and changes of symmetry of the system is assumed , it would be a great advantage if one can use it to characterize the quantum phase transitions .",

    "the motivation of the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions can be traced back to the work of quan _ et al _ @xcite in determining two ground - state phases of the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model by the loschmidt echo .",
    "the loschmidt echo @xcite has been introduced to describe the hypersensitivity of the time evolution to perturbations experienced by the environmental system .",
    "they found the quantum critical behavior of the environmental system strongly affects its capability of enhancing the decay of loschmidt echo . since the loschmidt echo is defined as the overlap between two time - dependent states corresponding to two points separated slightly by a target spin with ising interaction , its decay around the critical point represents a large distance between two states .",
    "subsequently , zanardi and paunkovi @xcite proposed out that a static fidelity might be a good indicator for quantum phase transitions with examples of the one - dimensional transverse - field xy model and the dicke model .",
    "similar idea was also proposed by zhou and barjaktarevic @xcite .",
    "motivated by these works , the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions was quickly applied to free fermionic systems @xcite and graphs @xcite , matrix - product states @xcite , and the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "an attempt to understand quantum phase transitions from the thermal fidelity was also made @xcite . at that time",

    "two groups addressed the role of the leading term of the fidelity in the quantum critical phenomena .",
    "et al _ introduced , based on the differential - geometry approach , the riemannian metric tensor pzanardi0701061 inherited from the parameter space to denote the leading term in the fidelity , and argued that the singularity of this metric corresponds to quantum phase transitions .",
    "while you _",
    "et al _ introduced another concept , the so - called fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) wlyou07 , and established a general relation between the leading term of the fidelity and the structure factor ( correlation functions ) of the driving term in the hamiltonian .",
    "both of them obtained also that , if one extend the fidelity to thermal states , the leading term of the fidelity between two neighboring thermal states is simply the specific heat . in the following",
    ", we will use fidelity susceptibility \" to name the leading term of the fidelity because it not only denotes mathematically the fluctuation of the driving term , such as the specific heat derived from the internal energy , but also is closer to the picture of condensed matter physics , i.e. the response of the fidelity to driving parameter . from then on ,",
    "the field of the fidelity approach to quantum ( or thermal ) phase transitions can be divided roughly into two streams .",
    "the first stream still focuses on the fidelity itself , for which the distance between two points in the parameter space is still important , while the second stream pays particular attention to the leading term of the fidelity .    along the first stream ,",
    "a connection between the fidelity , scaling and renormalization was introduced by zhou @xcite , in which the fidelity between two reduced states of a part of the system described by a reduced - density matrix was proposed .",
    "et al _ hqzhou07114651 tried to understand the fidelity from a geometric perspective . in works of zhou and his colleagues ,",
    "the fidelity is averaged over the system size , and is named as fidelity per site .",
    "they found that the fidelity per site is a very useful tool for various interacting systems .",

    "several questions appeared at that time .",
    "1 ) since the leading term of the fidelity is a combination of correlation functions , which seems a tool widely used only in the landau - ginzburg - wilson theory , is the fidelity still able to describe the beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless and topological phase transitions ?",
    "2 ) what is the scaling behavior of the fidelity and its relation to the universality class ? 3 ) how about the thermal phase transitions and those quantum phase transitions induced by the continuous ground - state level - crossing where the perturbation method is not applicable .",
    "most subsequent works are more or less related to these questions , though some topics are still controversial .",
    "based on the general relation between the leading term of the fidelity and correlation functions of the driving term @xcite , venuti and zanardi @xcite applied the traditional scaling transformation , and obtained an interesting scaling relation between the dynamic exponent , the dimension of the system , and the size exponents of the fidelity . a similar scaling relation was also obtained numerically by gu _",
    "et al _ sjgu072 in their studies on the one - dimensional asymmetric hubbard model .",
    "both relations imply that the fidelity susceptibility might not have singular behavior in some cases , such the beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition occurring in the asymmetric hubbard model at half - filling sjgu072 .    on the other hand",
    ", yang @xcite tried to understand the singular behavior of the fidelity susceptibility from the ground - state energy density and pointed out that the fidelity susceptibility might not be able to detect the high - order phase transitions .",
    "a little surprising is that their example , i.e. the effective model of the one - dimensional xxz chain , which undergoes a beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition of infinite order at the isotropic point , shows singular behavior in the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "similar analysis on the luttinger liquid model with a wave functional approach was also done by fjrestad @xcite .",
    "the further investigations on spin-1 xxz chain with uniaxial anisotropy by yang _",
    "et al _ @xcite supported partially their previous conclusion and the scaling relation obtained by venuti and zanardi lcvenuti07 .",
    "later , chen _ et al _",
    "@xcite addressed the feasibility of the fidelity susceptibility in quantum phase transitions of various order by the perturbation theory , and concluded that the fidelity susceptibility can not describe the phase transition of infinite order .",
    "this conclusion conflicts with both yang s works on the one - dimensional xxz model @xcite and the subsequent studies on the one - dimensional hubbard model lcvenuti08012473 , but supports previous conclusion obtained by you _ _ et al__@xcite .",
    "therefore , the issue on fidelity in describing high - order phase transitions seems still controversial .",
    "recently it was realized that the fidelity susceptibility can be either intensive , extensive , or superextensive , then the critical exponents of the rescaled fidelity susceptibility at both sides of the critical point can be different @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fidelity susceptibility , the sub - leading term of the fidelity might appear when parameters are changed along a critical manifold @xcite .",
    "it became a branch of the story when hamma _",
    "et al _ @xcite firstly touched the feasibility of the fidelity in topological phase transitions .",
    "they found that though the fidelity shows an obvious drop around the critical point of a topological transition , it can not tell the type of transition .",
    "almost one year later , three groups revisited the role of fidelity in the topological transitions .",
    "et al _ jhzhao0803 studied the fidelity in the kitaev honeycomb model and found that fidelity has shows singular behavior at the critical point .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the fidelity susceptibility in the same model and obtained various critical exponents , they also witnessed a kind of long - range correlation in the ground state of kitaev honeycomb model . while abasto _",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the fidelity in the deformed kitaev toric model and obtained a form of fidelity between thermal states .",
    "the three groups drew a similar conclusion that the fidelity can describe the topological phase transitions occurring in the both models .",
    "a noteworthy advance in the fidelity approach is the success of using the state overlap to detect quantum critical point by a nuclear - magnetic - resonance quantum simulator@xcite .",
    "it was observed that the different types of quantum phase transitions in the transverse - field ising model can be witnessed in experiments .",
    "such an advance is remarkable .",
    "it makes the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions no longer purely theoretical .    on the other hand",
    ", the global - state fidelity can not characterize those quantum phase transitions induced by continuous level - crossing due to its collapse at each crossing point .",
    "et al _ @xcite firstly tackled this type of phase transition with the strategy of the reduced fidelity , which actually was introduced in previous works hqzhou07042945,npaunkovic07 .",
    "meanwhile , ma _",
    "et al _ @xcite also studied the critical behavior of the reduced fidelity in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model .",
    "the reduced fidelity was latter applied to the one - dimensional transverse - field ising @xcite and xy models@xcite , the dimerized heisenberg chain@xcite , and the one - dimensional extended hubbard model @xcite .",
    "despite of the absence of the thermal phase transition in the one - dimensional xy model , the thermal - state fidelity was firstly used to study the crossover occurring in the low - temperature critical region pzanardi032109 .",
    "interestingly , the leading term of the thermal - state fidelity was later found to be just the specific heat pzanardi0701061,wlyou07 .",
    "the thermal - state fidelity was also applied to the bcs superconductivity and the stoner - hubbard model with the mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , quan and cucchietti htquan08064633 tried to find the advantages and disvantages of the fidelity approach to the thermal phase transitions .",
    "finally , though we focus on the fidelity between the static ground state only , we would like to mention that the loschmidt echo has also been widely applied to study the quantum phase transitions fmcucchiettipra032337,ycoujpa2455,zgyuanpra012102,drossinipra032333,htquanpra012104,lcwangpla362,yclipra032117,xxyiepjd355,zgyuanpra042118 , ccormickpra022317,drossinipra052112,wgwangpre056218,cylaiprb205419 . in studies of the loschmidt echo",

    "the main purpose of this review is to gather these distributed works into a unified paradigm , then provides interested readers , especially beginners , a systematic framework of the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions .",

    "will be presented in the concluding section .",
    "in this section , we introduce briefly the concept of quantum fidelity and discuss its properties in a simple quantum - state adiabatic evolution of a 1/2 spin subjected to an external field .      in quantum physics , an overlap between two quantum states usually denotes the transition amplitude from one state to the another auhlmann76,palberti83,pmalberti831,pmalberti832 . while from the point view of information theory , the overlap can measure the similarity ( closeness ) between two states @xcite .",
    "that is the overlap gives unity if two states are exactly the same , while zero if they are orthogonal .",
    "such an interpretation has a special meaning in quantum information theory @xcite since physicists in the field ( for examples , ref @xcite ) hope that a quantum state can be transferred over a long distance without loss of any information .",
    "the overlap between the input and output states becomes a useful measure of the loss of information during the transportation .",
    "the overlap is used to define the fidelity in quantum information theory .    to be precise ,",
    "if we define the overlap between two pure states as @xmath4the fidelity is simply the modulus of the overlap , i.e.@xmath5where @xmath6 are the input and output states respectively , and both of them are normalized .",
    "the fidelity has a geometric meaning as well .",
    "since a pure state in quantum mechanics mathematically is a vector in the hilbert space , then according to linear algebra , an inner product of two vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 is @xmath9where @xmath10 is the magnitude of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the angle between them . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "wave functions are usually normalized , and the fidelity represents the angle distance between two states .",
    "the fidelity has the following expected properties ( _ axioms _ ) rjozsa94 @xmath13where @xmath14 denotes a unitary transformation and @xmath15 is the state of one subsystem . for pure states , the global phase difference may affect the overlap , but not the fidelity .    the quantum fidelity between two mixed states ( @xmath16 ) is defined as @xcite @xmath17here @xmath18 is semi - positive defined and normalized , i.e. tr@xmath19tr@xmath20 .",

    "for example , chen _ et al _ @xcite proposed @xmath27 ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the dimension of the system . this definition has a hyperbolic geometric interpretation , and is reduced to eq .",
    "[ eq : fidelity_bure ] in the special case of @xmath30 .",
    "the definition [ eq . ( [ eq : fidelitydef_chen ] ) ] was recently simplified to @xcite @xmath31obviously , one of advantages of the above definitions is that the fidelity can be easily evaluated for arbitrary mixed states .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that for two density matrices of two sets of mutually independent events , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelitydef_chen2 ] ) gives a nonzero value .",
    "therefore , another definition of the fidelity was proposed @xcite , i.e.@xmath32    the fidelity has been widely used in many fields . in quantum information science , the fidelity between quantum states have been proved useful resources in approaching a number of fundamental problems such as quantifying entanglement @xcite .",
    "there are also many interesting works on the fidelity in adiabatic processes . for example",
    ", the adiabatic fidelity was used to describe atom - to - molecule conversion @xcite in atomic systems and the time evolution in a bose - einstein condensate@xcite .",
    "physicists working on quantum chaos @xcite use quantum fidelity ( loschmidt echo ) to measures the hypersensitivity to small perturbations of quantum dynamics . in the latter case ,",
    "the fidelity usually depends on the time .",
    "interested readers can find more details about the loschmidt echo in a recent review article by gorin _",
    "et al _ tgorinprep . in the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions , which will be introduced in this review , the fidelity depends on the adiabatic parameter ( or driving parameter ) of the hamiltonian , and is usually static .",
    "to well understand the fidelity in the ground - state state evolution , in this subsection , we take a 1/2 spin subjected an external magnetic field as a warm - up example .",

    "the real part denotes the difference in the geometrical structure , while the imaginary one corresponds to the overall phase difference .",
    "though the overlap shows also the similarity between two states , it does not show the response of the state at a given point to the adiabatic parameter @xmath46 .",
    "for this purpose , we expand the overlap around a given @xmath43 as @xmath47where @xmath48the linear term is the berry adiabatic connection , which contribute a pancharatnam - berry phase @xcite to the spin as the magnetic field rotates adiabatically around cone direction ( the dotted circle in fig .",
    "[ figure_bloch ] ) , i.e.    @xmath49    the phase equals to the solid angle of the cone if the spin rotates one periodicity .",
    "the berry connection must be a purely imagnary number because of @xmath50    the global phase can be rectified by a gauge transformation @xmath51 , which can compensate the geometric phase @xmath52 accumulated during the adiabatic evolution .",

    "moreover , the gauge transformation not only eliminates the berry adiabatic connection , but also modifies the second order term . after the phase rectification",
    ", the second - order term is reduced to a minimum . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase rectification denotes mathematically a rotation in the complex plane , which makes the overlap be a purely geometric quantity .",
    "if we take the modulus of the overlap , it becomes the fidelity @xmath55then the fidelity , if we express it in a series form , becomes@xmath56therefore , the leading response of the fidelity to the adiabatic parameter is its second derivative .",
    "this is quite natural because the fidelity can not be large than its upper limit 1 , it must be an even function of the perturbation of the adiabatic parameter .",
    "the leading term is called fidelity susceptibility in some literatures because it is physically a kind of structure of the driving term , @xmath57though the phase rectification can change the berry adiabatic connection and the second derivative of the overlap , the fidelity susceptibility does not change .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the simple reason a gauge transformation can not affect the modulos of the overlap .    on the other hand ,",
    "when we study quantum phase transitions occurring in a quantum - many body system , the ground - state wavefunction is usually defined in the real space , then the imaginary part of the overlap does not appear .",
    "if the adiabatic parameter is defined on the flat manifold , the linear correction is zero .",
    "the second term is the most important .",
    "it denotes the leading response of the wave function to the adiabatic parameter .",
    "though for the present case it is simply a constant due to the rotational symmetry of @xmath46 , it might become singular for a many - body system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "now we consider another case of fixing both @xmath12 and @xmath43 , and changing the magnitude of the external field . if @xmath58 , the ground state is@xmath59with eigenenergy @xmath60 , while if @xmath61 , the ground state becomes@xmath62with eigenenergy @xmath34 .",
    "a ground - state level - crossing occurs at the point @xmath63",
    ". then the fidelity shows a very sharp drop at @xmath63 due to the level - crossing between two orthogonal states . while if we expand the fidelity in term of @xmath34 , one may find that either the fidelity susceptibility or the berry adiabatic connection is zero except for @xmath63 .",
    "the point is a singular for both of the fidelity susceptibility and the berry adiabatic connection . in many studies on the pancharatnam - berry phase",
    ", this level - crossing point is regarded as a monopole in the parameter space .",
    "the fidelity and its leading term introduced in the last section is illustrative . in this section",
    ", we try to establish a bridge between quantum phase transitions and the fidelity in considerable detail through the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model .",
    "[ sec : fs ]      without loss of generality , the hamiltonian of a general quantum many - body system , which might undergo a quantum phase transition in parameter space , can be written as @xmath64where @xmath65 is the driving hamiltonian and @xmath66 denotes its strength . according to quantum mechanics , the system satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath67where @xmath68 is the eigenenergy and set to an increasing order @xmath69 , and @xmath70 defines a set of orthogonal complete bases in the hilbert space , i.e.@xmath71",
    "as the driving parameter @xmath66 varies , the energy spectra are changed correspondingly .",
    "the quantum phase transition occurs as the ground - state energy undergoes a significant change at a certain point .",
    "precisely , its first- or higher - order derivative with respect to the driving parameter becomes discontinuous at the transition point .",
    "there are two distinct ways .",
    "the first one is the energy level - crossing occurring in the ground state ( left plot of fig .",

    "instead , it is a pure geometric quantity of quantum states . in its approach to quantum phase transitions ,",
    "one of obvious advantage is that _ no priori _ knowledge of order parameter and symmetry - breaking is required .",
    "for example , if a quantum phase transition is induced by the ground - state level crossing , then the two crossing states at the transition point are orthogonal , then the overlap between them is zero ; while the fidelity almost equals to one in other region away from the crossing point .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the fidelity can describe quantum phase transitions in its own way .",

    "the hamiltonian is invariant under translational operation .",
    "moreover , unlike usual spin systems ,  the @xmath80-component of total spins in this model , i.e. @xmath81is not conserved . instead ,",

    "so they do not change the parity of the system .",
    "this property defines a classification of subspaces based on the parity operators , i.e.@xmath85and the hamiltonian can not change the parity of the state , i.e. @xmath86=0.\\]]therefore , we have two subspaces corresponding to parity @xmath87 respectively .",

    "the ground - state properties change as the external field @xmath77 turns on .",
    "because of @xmath91the magnetic field mixes @xmath92 and @xmath93 and the ground state becomes non - degenerate for a finite system . despite of this , the ground - state property does not change qualitatively .",
