    "over the years there have been numerous attempts at extending the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "some of these models have been proposed with the purpose of explaining some particular feature of the sm .",
    "for example , grand unified theories ( guts ) ` explain ' the convergence of coupling constants at some energy as a manifestation of a single fundamental unified interaction .",
    "other models such as supersymmetry ( susy ) have been proposed for mainly aesthetic reasons ; susy introduces a symmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "but so far none of these attempts has been entirely successful , although susy guts are phenomenologically consistent with the unification of the sm gauge coupling constants and do not suffer from the technical gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "another approach to extending the sm is to look at the sm itself and look for distinctive features which could be generalised or assumed to hold in an extended theory .",
    "the sm has been so successful that , within our experimental and calculational accuracy , it has proved to be a perfect description of nature ( except for the gravitational interaction ) .",
    "so we have good reason to say that taking guidance from the sm is akin to  listening to god \" .",
    "having accepted this point of view we must now try to interpret the message of the sm . by this",
    "we mean that we must look for fundamental features in the sm which could distinguish it from similar and , without experimental evidence , equally plausible models .",
    "we propose that one such feature is charge quantisation .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the conventional weak hypercharge .",
    "the duality has value 1 if the representation is an @xmath3 doublet ( * 2 * ) and 0 if it is an @xmath3 singlet ( * 1 * ) .",
    "the triality has value 1 if the representation is an @xmath4 triplet ( * 3 * ) , 0 if it is an @xmath4 singlet ( * 1 * ) , and -1 if it is an @xmath4 anti - triplet ( @xmath5 ) . in general we can define n - ality to be the number of n - plet representations of @xmath6 which must be combined to give the representation of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular n - ality has value 1 if a representation is an @xmath6 n - plet ( @xmath7 ) , 0 if it is an @xmath6 singlet ( * 1 * ) , and -1 if it is an @xmath6 anti - n - plet ( @xmath8 ) . note that in @xmath3 the @xmath9 representation is equivalent to the * 2 * representation .",
    "we expect that in an extension of the sm this charge quantisation relation or some generalisation of it will hold .",
    "an obvious way of extending the sm is to extend the gauge group .",
    "the standard model group ( @xmath10 ) is @xcite @xmath11 where the discrete group @xmath12 ensures the above quantisation rule ( @xmath13 is the identity of @xmath6 ) .",
    "we argue that the most obvious extension is to add more groups to the sequence @xmath14 and to use a different discrete group so that the quantisation rule above is generalised to involve all the group components .",
    "one of the groups we consider is @xmath15 where the discrete group @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is an integer which is not a multiple of @xmath20 .",
    "this group gives a generalised quantisation rule @xmath21 which is the simplest generalisation of the sm charge quantisation rule .",
    "further generalisations are obtained by extending the sequence @xmath22 with a set of @xmath6 factors , where the  @xmath23 s are greater than 3 and mutually prime .",
    "the latter condition ensures that the generalised quantisation rule shares the property with the sm rule , eq .",
    "( [ smchqu ] ) , that a given allowed value of @xmath24 implies a unique combination of @xmath23-alities : ( duality , triality ,  , @xmath25-ality ,  ) .",
    "we will consider the fundamental scale to be the planck mass ( @xmath26 ) and our models will be a full description of physics without gravity below this scale .",
    "the assumptions we make about our models essentially lead to the conclusion that all new fermions with a mass significantly below @xmath26 must have a mass below the tev scale as explained in section  [ technicolour ] .",
    "therefore our models all describe low energy physics ( below the tev scale ) and have a desert up to the planck scale where new physics will occur .",
    "we do nt specify any details about the planck scale physics since it is largely irrelevant to low energy physics .",
    "we shall describe the gauge groups considered in this paper and the motivation for choosing such groups in section  [ groups ] .",
    "we shall consider general types of gauge groups and also give specific examples , concentrating on the group @xmath27 defined above .",
    "when we also impose the condition that all fermions are in fundamental representations , as in the sm , we are limited to the models which we shall consider in this paper . after choosing the gauge group we want to examine which low mass fermions ( low relative to the planck scale ) can exist in the model .",
    "we must check that the model is then consistent , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the main theoretical constraint is that there are no anomalies as described in section  [ anoms ] .",
    "this greatly limits the choice of fermions and their weak hypercharges in our models . in appendix  [ smgen ]",
    "we show how the sm generation can be derived using our assumptions about charge quantisation and anomaly cancellation .",
    "there is one important fact to keep in mind when proposing any extended model which has extra non - abelian gauge groups such as @xmath6 .",
    "as we already know from the sm , the @xmath4 group acts as a technicolour group @xcite and gives a contribution to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 masses . in the sm",
    "this contribution is very small but when confining groups with @xmath30 are considered we must carefully consider the effect this will have . since we are not wanting the complications of extended technicolour in order to generate quark and lepton masses , we assume that there is a higgs doublet and that the masses of the weak gauge bosons are generated by a combination of the higgs sector of the theory and the technicolour effects of the gauge groups .",
    "this happens in exactly the same way as in the sm where qcd gives a small contribution to the @xmath28 and @xmath31 masses @xcite . for our models to be perturbatively valid ,",
    "all yukawa couplings at the electroweak scale must be not much greater than 1 .",
    "however , we will sometimes take a somewhat higher mass threshold for all the new fermions when checking to see if a model could be perturbatively valid up to the planck scale .",
    "for example , we can calculate the running gauge coupling constants , assuming that all the new fermions can be included in the renormalisation group equations ( rges ) at the tev scale .",
    "thus we can check to see if any gauge coupling constant becomes infinite below the planck scale ( i.e.  if there are any landau poles , especially for the @xmath0 coupling ) .",
    "if the threshold was lower then the new fermions would effect the coupling constants even more but this would only be a small effect .",
    "obviously we do not want the coupling constants to become infinite or the theory will be inconsistent .",
    "when we do this we find that there are few self - consistent models allowed by our assumptions , in the sense that for any particular gauge group only a few combinations of fermions which cancel the anomalies do not cause the @xmath0 gauge coupling to diverge .",
    "we will show that in the model with gauge group @xmath27 we can add new fermions with masses accessible to present or planned future accelerators , in particular a fourth generation of quarks without any new leptons .",
    "although the model is consistent and can be tested experimentally in the near future , it is not called for theoretically and does not resolve any of the outstanding problems of the sm .",
    "nevertheless it is the simplest alternative to the sm which has the same characteristic properties as the sm itself . in section  [ thconstraints ]",
    "we shall outline our requirements for a viable model .",
    "we will discuss theoretical constraints such as anomaly cancellation as well as aesthetic extrapolations from the sm , including charge quantisation as already mentioned .    in section  [ expconstraints ] we shall discuss the experimental constraints which arise from the consistency of the sm with experiments .",
    "this includes the experimental limits on the mass of the top quark and the masses of new , undetected fermions .    in section  [ simplifications ]",
    "we will discuss the simplification of the anomaly constraints when we assume that all fermions get a mass by the sm higgs mechanism .",
    "in section  [ only5sfails ] we shall show the difficulty of constructing a model where all the new fermions are in 5-plet or anti-5-plet representations of @xmath32 .",
    "we shall show that such a solution is not possible within the context of our model .    in section  [ su2*sun ] we will see how the difficulties of section [ only5sfails ] can be overcome by also adding fermions which are @xmath32 singlets ; in particular a fourth generation of quarks but no fourth generation of leptons .",
    "we will also show how such a solution can be formulated in a more general gauge group .    in section  [ conclusion ]",
    "we shall discuss the overall merits of such a model and how easily it could be tested experimentally .",
    "first we shall discuss which models we will be considering as viable extensions of the sm and then we shall discuss in detail the requirements for a potentially successful extension of the sm .",
    "we shall use some of these constraints when constructing models and the rest to check the consistency of our models .      in this section",
    "we discuss aesthetic extrapolations from the sm .",
    "these are features of the sm which have no obvious explanation but in some way can be used to specify the model almost uniquely .",
    "we try to pick out these features and carry them over to or generalise them in our extended model .",
    "this is a method of selecting a particular model and our view is that this is the most logical method although the features chosen may of course be subject to personal prejudice .",
    "[ chquant ] as stated in section  [ intro ] , an obvious way of extending the sm is to extend the gauge group .",
    "the @xmath10 is ; @xmath33 where the discrete group @xmath34 ensures the quantisation rule , eq .",
    "( [ smchqu ] ) .",
    "we believe that the most obvious extension is to add more special unitary groups to the sequence @xmath14 and to use a different discrete group so that the quantisation rule above is generalised . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that the group should be of the form @xmath35 where the product is over all @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a prime number less than or equal to the prime number @xmath38 .",
    "the discrete group @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is an integer which is not a multiple of @xmath23 .",
    "in fact we can obviously choose @xmath43 since @xmath42 is really only defined modulo n. we also have the freedom to choose that there are , for example , at least as many @xmath3 doublets which are @xmath7 representations of @xmath6 as @xmath8 representations since we can conjugate @xmath6 and set @xmath44 .",
    "we will use this fact later to eliminate duplicate solutions where all n - plets and anti - n - plets have been interchanged .",
    "this also allows us to fix @xmath45 .",
    "this group gives a generalised quantisation rule @xmath46    we will also consider the more general groups defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 here @xmath49 and the @xmath25 are odd and mutually prime ( we can obviously assume they are arranged in ascending order ) .",
    "so the quantisation rule is @xmath50 where we have defined @xmath51 to be the duality and @xmath52 to be the @xmath25-ality of a representation .",
    "the groups @xmath53 are the minimal extensions of the @xmath10 ( @xmath54 ) which are inspired by the @xmath10 , in the sense that each is also a cross product of @xmath0 and a set of distinct special unitary groups with a charge quantisation rule involving all the direct factors and contains the @xmath10 as a subgroup .",
    "the property of the @xmath10 that the value of @xmath24 determines both the duality and triality extrapolates to the principle that @xmath24 should also fix the @xmath23-ality , but then it is needed that 2 , 3 and @xmath23 are mutually prime .",
    "it has been suggested that a defining property of the smg is that it has few outer automorphisms relative to the rank of the group @xcite .",
    "this can be described by saying that it is very skew .",
    "the intermingling of the various simple groups @xmath3 , @xmath55 ,  @xmath56 implied by the charge quantisation rule , eq .  ( [ genchquant ] ) , helps to suppress the number of outer automorphisms and `` generalised automorphisms '' .",
    "thus a group like @xmath57 would indeed be more skew than groups without such intermingling .",
    "alternatively we can derive eq .",
    "( [ genchquant ] ) directly as a natural generalisation of the sm charge quantisation rule , eq .",
    "( [ smchqu ] ) .",
    "of course it is possible that the apparent charge quantisation rule in the sm is simply due to chance ; i.e.  the fermions in the sm just happen to obey that particular rule .",
    "however we believe that the quantisation rule is a fundamental feature of the sm ; so we argue that it is very difficult to see how there can not be a generalisation of this rule in an extended model , while still retaining the general features of the sm .",
    "in fact the form of the generalised quantisation rule is suggested from the sm and there seems to be little choice in selecting the rule since the sm rule appears to be the one which involves all the direct factors equivalently .",
    "in fact the choice of the most complicated charge quantisation rule in some way defines the @xmath10 .",
    "this is why we have divided out the discrete groups @xmath39 and @xmath58 .      in the sm , for each @xmath6 group , the fermion representations are either n - plet ( @xmath7 ) , anti n - plet ( @xmath8 ) or singlet ( * 1 * ) .",
    "this can be described by saying that all the fermions lie in fundamental representations of each @xmath6 group to which they couple .",
    "we pick this as a feature of the sm which we shall extend to our models .",
    "we note here that this is in contrast to some other attempts to extend the sm .",
    "for example in susy there are fermions in other representations ( e.g.  gauginos in adjoint representations ) .",
    "fundamental representations are also suggested in @xcite since these make the weyl equation most stable when considering random dynamics .",
    "another feature is that the weak hypercharge is in some way minimised in the sm , subject of course to the constraints of anomaly cancellation and charge quantisation , as shown in appendix  [ smgen ] .",
    "so in our extended model we will choose hypercharge values close to zero when this is possible .",
    "more precisely , we choose to minimise the sum of weak hypercharges squared over all fermions .",
    "this will also minimise the running of the @xmath0 gauge coupling constant and so give each model the best chance of being consistent up to the planck scale , which we require as stated in section  [ desert ] .",
    "the sm has been tested at energies up to a few hundred gev .",
    "there have been many theories proposed which would be valid at energy scales ranging from 1 tev up to the planck scale around @xmath59 tev .",
    "many of these theories have a large range of energy where no new physics occurs .",
    "one example is guts where there is typically no new physics from the sm energy scale up to the grand unification scale around @xmath60 tev .",
    "an alternative is that there is no new physics until the planck scale where we can be almost certain that quantum gravity will have a significant effect .",
    "we shall adopt this view for our extended models .",
    "this means that once we have set the mass scale for the fermions in the extended model , we can calculate the running coupling constants and check to see if there is a landau pole below the planck scale , i.e.  whether the @xmath0 gauge coupling becomes infinite below the planck scale .",
    "if there is a landau pole then we will conclude that such a model is not consistent .",
    "in this section we shall describe some alternative extensions of the sm",
    ". we will consider groups similar to those we are examining in this paper in the sense that they contain the @xmath10 and additional special unitary group factors .",
    "this obviously does not include models which unify the individual components of the @xmath10 or models which involve susy .",
    "there have been many such models and the additional symmetries are usually used to explain coupling constant unification , the number of families in the sm or the fermion mass hierarchy in a fairly natural way .    in the models described in section [ groups ]",
    "the sm fermions can not couple to any new gauge fields because of the charge quantisation rule .",
    "this is due to the fact that all values of @xmath24 in the sm are multiples of @xmath61 and so the charge quantisation rule , eq .",
    "( [ genchquant ] ) , forces the sm fermions to be singlets of all @xmath6 groups where @xmath30 are distinct primes .",
    "however the situation is more complicated if we allow more than one @xmath6 gauge group for any particular @xmath23 . where we have @xmath62 or 3 there are two distinct cases . in the first case the sm group @xmath6 is an invariant subgroup of the extended group .",
    "we then call the extra @xmath6 groups a horizontal symmetry . in the other case",
    "the @xmath6 group in the @xmath10 is not an invariant subgroup and is generally a diagonal subgroup of the extended group .",
    "if we have one more @xmath3 or @xmath4 group then we can have a horizontal symmetry ( a non - abelian symmetry which places fermions from different generations in the same multiplet ) .",
    "the idea of a gauged horizontal symmetry is not new and has been used to try and explain the mass hierarchy of the sm fermions @xcite .",
    "however , an @xmath6 group with @xmath30 is not a possible horizontal symmetry without introducing many more fermions because there are only 3 generations of sm fermions and the smallest non - trivial representation of @xmath6 is the n - plet .",
    "for example if @xmath63 we would have an @xmath32 horizontal symmetry and so we would need at least 5 generations of sm fermions .",
    "if the horizontal symmetry gauge group is @xmath64 then we must place fermions from different generations in the same triplet ( or anti - triplet ) .",
    "it turns out that the only way to do this , avoiding anomalies ( see section  [ anoms ] ) and not introducing any new fermions , is to put all fermions in the same ( or conjugate ) representation of @xmath64 as they are in the colour group @xmath65 of the sm ; so that all three generations of left handed quarks are put in a triplet ( or anti - triplet ) of @xmath64 etc .",
    "however , the sm fermions would not then obey the charge quantisation rule which might be expected , similar to eq .",
    "( [ genchquant ] ) ; @xmath66    if the horizontal symmetry group is @xmath67 then we can make some or all sm fermions triplets of @xmath67 but this is not the smallest representation and so we do not favour this as explained in section  [ smallreps ] .",
    "we could place some fermions in doublets of @xmath67 .",
    "this could be done , without introducing any anomalies , by placing two generations of quarks in the same doublet or taking two generations and placing the fermions in the same representation of @xmath67 as they are in @xmath68 .",
    "different doublets could connect fermions from a different pair of generations .",
    "for example left handed quarks from the first and second generations could be in the same doublet , right handed ` up ' quarks from the first and third generations could be in the same doublet and right handed ` down ' quarks from the second and third generations could be in the same doublet .",
    "this would not give any anomalies though it is difficult to see how this could be used to explain the fermion masses .",
    "the main problem is that fermions in different generations with very different masses are put in the same multiplet .",
    "this means that the fermions would naturally get the same mass .",
    "it is difficult to break the symmetry in such a way that the masses of all the different fermions are split by realistic amounts @xcite .",
    "we do not consider these possibilities in this paper because triplets of @xmath3 are not fundamental representations and the other possibilities , with gauge group @xmath67 or @xmath64 , mean that the fermions could not obey the extended charge quantisation rule .",
    "of course models involving horizontal symmetries do not enforce such charge quantisation rules .      in the case",
    "where , for example , the @xmath65 subgroup of the @xmath10 is not an invariant subgroup of the full gauge group , the only possibility is that it is a diagonal ( or anti - diagonal ) subgroup of @xmath69 . in this type of model",
    "different generations can couple to different @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge groups in the full gauge group .",
    "there would then be symmetry breaking to produce the @xmath10 , in such a way that @xmath65 could be said to be a diagonal subgroup of all the @xmath4 groups in the full group which exists at energies higher than the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "in other words , @xmath65 is then the subgroup in which all the @xmath4 groups undergo the same transformations . in this way",
    "it is trivial to cancel all the anomalies , since each generation of quarks and leptons cancel all anomalies separately and couple to a @xmath70 subgroup of the full group in the same way as they couple to the @xmath10 .",
    "this is in contrast to the invariant subgroup case , where the sm fermions had to couple to the @xmath10 and also to other subgroups of the full gauge group .",
    "also in the diagonal case , the dimension of each representation is the same as in the sm , whereas , in the invariant subgroup case , the dimensions were larger since different sm representations were combined under the horizontal symmetry .",
    "this type of model has been proposed @xcite as an alternative to horizontal symmetries or grand unification .",
    "examples include topcolour models @xcite and the anti - grand unification model @xcite , where the group @xmath71 has been used to successfully predict the values of the gauge coupling constants .",
    "the anti - grand unification model has also been analysed as a model to explain the hierarchy of sm fermion masses @xcite . here the extended model with gauge group @xmath72 has been fairly successful at reproducing the observed fermion masses in an order of magnitude approximation ( reproducing all sm fermion masses within a factor of 2 or 3 ) . the extra @xmath73 gauge symmetry is called a flavour symmetry and is required to produce the observed mass differences within the second and third generations , e.g. @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the fermions in some of these models obey extended charge quantisation rules which we would expect .",
    "for example the fermions in the @xmath75 model obey the charge quantisation rules ; @xmath76 where the three copies of the @xmath10 are labelled by @xmath77 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "with three separate charge quantisation rules , this is not truly a straightforward extrapolation of the sm charge quantisation rule .",
    "however it is similar in the sense that these rules are required to produce the group @xmath75 which has as large @xmath78 as the group @xmath10 itself .",
    "is defined in @xcite for any group @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the rank of the group @xmath79 ( really the number of @xmath0 factors in the maximal abelian subgroup ) .",
    "further , @xmath82 is defined as the order of the factor group , obtained by dividing the group of all abelian charge combinations @xmath83 allowed for any representations of the group @xmath79 , by the group of those abelian charge combinations allowed for representations trivial under the semi - simple part of the group @xmath79 . ]",
    "the quantity @xmath78 measures how strongly intermingled the @xmath0 subgroups are with the semi - simple part via the dividing discrete groups ( i.e. equivalently via the quantisation rule(s ) ) .",
    "it happens that groups of the form @xmath84 have the largest possible value of this measure @xmath78= @xmath85 .",
    "the charge quantisation rules are chosen to maximise @xmath78 for the group @xmath72 among all those with the same algebra although this group does not have as large a value of @xmath78 as the @xmath10 .",
    "in fact @xmath86 for the group @xmath72 .",
    "however , the symmetry breaking scale of the group @xmath75 is taken to be just below the planck scale in the anti - grand unification model and in this paper we wish to study the possibilities of new physics at much lower energies ; energies of the same order of magnitude as the electroweak scale rather than the planck scale .",
    "this is still possible in such a model but it then loses its ability to predict the gauge coupling constants .",
    "topcolour models do introduce new dynamics at the tev scale but in this paper we shall not consider such models .        in any chiral gauge theory , gauge anomalies can arise .",
    "these anomalies lead to an inconsistent theory and so they must not be present in a good theory .",
    "each fermion representation makes its contribution to each type of anomaly .",
    "we say that there is an anomaly present if the total contribution to an anomaly from all the fermion representations is non - zero .    as explained in section  [ groups ] , the models considered in this paper have gauge groups of the general form @xmath87 the discrete group @xmath88 leads to charge quantisation .",
    "we assume all fermions to be in @xmath7 , @xmath8 or singlet ( * 1 * ) representations of each @xmath6 , as discussed in section  [ smallreps ] .",
    "we define n to be the n - ality of a representation ( @xmath89 ( -1 ) for representation @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath90 for singlet representation ) .",
    "we can also define the size , @xmath91 , of each representation as the dimension of the representation ( e.g.  in the sm , @xmath92 for the @xmath93 representation of @xmath94 which is equivalent to the fact that there are 6 left - handed quarks in each generation ) .    for gauge anomalies we sum the contribution for all left - handed fermions and subtract the sum over all right - handed fermions .",
    "this is equivalent to summing over left - handed fermions and left - handed anti - fermions .",
    "we have now introduced all the necessary notation to write down general equations for all types of gauge anomalies .",
    "=    the requirement that there are no anomalies present in a theory is analogous to the triangle feynman diagram in fig .  [ anomdiag ] with a fermion loop and three external gauge bosons ( labelled by @xmath79 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) having zero amplitude for all possible choices of gauge bosons @xmath79 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the contribution from each fermion representation is calculated by making particular choices for the fermions in the internal loop .",
    "these contributions must then sum to give zero amplitude if there is to be no anomaly .    if each of @xmath79 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 is an @xmath6 gauge boson where @xmath97 then each representation gives a relative contribution of @xmath98 ( since @xmath99 , 0 or 1 in our models ) .",
    "the total contribution is therefore @xmath100 where @xmath101 labels each left - handed fermion ( and anti - fermion ) representation .",
    "we label this type of anomaly @xmath102^{3}$ ] and require @xmath103    another type of anomaly corresponds to the diagram with one @xmath0 gauge boson and two @xmath6 gauge bosons where @xmath104 , labelled as @xmath102^{2}u(1)$ ] .",
    "each representation gives a relative contribution @xmath105 .",
    "therefore we require @xmath106    the final type of gauge anomaly corresponds to the diagram with all the gauge bosons @xmath79 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 being @xmath0 gauge bosons .",
    "this is labelled as @xmath107^{3}$ ] and each representation gives a relative contribution @xmath108 .",
    "therefore we require @xmath109      there is also a mixed gravitational and gauge anomaly @xcite which corresponds to one @xmath0 gauge boson and two gravitons .",
    "we will label this as @xmath110 ^ 2u(1)$ ] .",
    "each representation gives a relative contribution @xmath111 and so this leads to the constraint @xmath112    another possible anomaly is the witten discrete @xmath3 anomaly @xcite .",
    "this states that if the number of left - handed @xmath3 doublets is odd then the theory is inconsistent . as we shall see later this anomaly",
    "does not give us any problems .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the constraints on our models which are due to experimental evidence .",
    "in particular we are concerned with the possibilities for the existence of more fermions and what restrictions can be imposed both directly and indirectly on their mass .",
    "some difficulty arises since fermions may be confined and so not directly observable .",
    "this means that direct experimental restrictions will refer to the mass of particles which are combinations of these fermions , like hadrons in the case for quarks .",
    "first we shall discuss the constraints on fermion masses due to the fact that so far no non - sm fermions have been observed .",
    "we shall show that this rules out any extra massless fermions and then give current limits on the masses of different type of new fermions .",
    "only three massless fermions have been observed and they are the three massless neutrinos described in the sm ( even if the neutrinos do have a small mass we know that there are only 3 with a mass less than @xmath113 ) .",
    "any other massless fermions , which had any significant coupling to the sm fermions or gauge bosons , would have been observed if they were not confined .",
    "when we assume that fermions belong only to fundamental and singlet representations ( as postulated in section  [ smallreps ] ) , the charge quantisation rule in our models ensures that the only possible fermions which would not be electrically charged would be neutrinos",
    ". a left - handed neutrino without a right - handed neutrino would be massless as in the sm .",
    "we already know that there are only three such neutrinos and so we can not consider this as a possibility for new fermions .",
    "a right - handed neutrino would be completely decoupled from the gauge group and so it could get a gauge invariant majorana mass .",
    "so we would expect that it would have a mass @xmath114 and so it is excluded as a low mass fermion in our models",
    ". therefore any new massless fermions in our models must be electrically charged and so must also be confined by a new interaction well above the qcd scale , on phenomenological grounds .",
    "if there is a confined gauge group then we assume that fermion condensates will be formed as in qcd .",
    "if a fermion does nt have a chiral partner with respect to some confined group @xmath115 , the condensates formed will break the group @xmath115 .",
    "so if we assume that there is no spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , other than that of the electroweak symmetry group , no fermions can be chiral w.r.t .",
    "@xmath79 where the full gauge group is @xmath116 ( where @xmath88 is some discrete group ) . in our models",
    "the extra @xmath6 gauge groups are all confining ( with negative beta functions ) , so that @xmath117 .",
    "if the left- and right - handed fermions occur with the same representations of the full gauge group @xmath116 , then the fermions can form a dirac mass term in the lagrangian .",
    "so they would be expected to get a mass comparable to the fundamental scale , which we take to be the planck mass in our models .",
    "such fermions would not contribute to any anomalies and would not be observable because of their high mass .",
    "we shall therefore ignore them in our models .",
    "if a fermion can not form such a fundamental dirac ( or majorana ) mass term then we say it is mass protected , since it would be fundamentally massless and could only get a mass indirectly through some interaction such as the higgs mechanism .",
    "all the fermions considered in our models are mass protected by the electroweak interactions .",
    "we conclude that all new fermions in our models must get their mass from the higgs mechanism .",
    "furthermore , they must couple to the usual sm higgs particle in the same way as the sm fermions .",
    "in other words , the fermion condensates must have the same quantum numbers as the sm higgs boson ; otherwise their contributions to the @xmath28 and @xmath31 masses , via the usual technicolour @xcite mechanism , would be analogous to those from the vacuum expectation values of higgs particles with non - standard weak isospin and hypercharges .",
    "this would lead to a significant deviation of the @xmath118 parameter ( @xmath119 ) from unity @xcite in contradiction with precision electroweak data .      in the sm",
    "there are two different types of fermions , quarks and leptons , which differ by the fact that quarks couple to the @xmath4 gauge fields and so are confined , whereas leptons have no direct coupling to the @xmath4 gauge fields and are not confined .",
    "there are experimental limits on the masses of any quarks and leptons which have not yet been observed .",
    "if there are any more leptons then they must have a mass greater than 45 gev @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that there are no more leptons , since even the neutrino would have to get a mass larger than this and it is difficult to see how a neutrino could naturally be given a mass greater than 45 gev but still much lower than the fundamental scale ( which is the planck scale in our models ) .",
    "this is because a right - handed neutrino , as already discussed in section  [ masslessfermions ] , would naturally get a majorana mass and so the see - saw mechanism @xcite would leave the left - handed neutrino with a very small mass . for this reason we can not allow any more generations of sm leptons .",
    "however the limits on the quark masses are dependent on the type of quark and its decay modes .",
    "the top quark has recently been observed by the cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite .",
    "the mass is in the range 150 - 220 gev . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we take the limit on possible fourth generation quarks , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , to be @xmath122 from the dilepton analyses of the cdf and d0 groups @xcite ( less restrictive limits apply if other decay modes are dominant ) .",
    "note that experimental limits are taken to apply to the pole masses .",
    "the above experimental limits do not apply to new fermions which are not singlets of the additional @xmath6 gauge groups .",
    "these fermions would be more difficult to detect experimentally and would anyway be confined inside ` hadrons ' with a confinement scale ( generically at the electroweak scale ) much higher than the qcd scale .",
    "we require our models to remain perturbative in the desert from the tev scale to the planck scale .",
    "so we can use the rges to examine how the yukawa couplings evolve from the planck scale down to the electroweak scale .",
    "in particular we study the infra - red quasi - fixed - point structure of the renormalisation group equations ( rges ) . in the sm",
    "the fixed point values provide upper limits on the mass of the top quark , @xmath123 , and the higgs scalar , @xmath124 .",
    "similarly in extended models we get upper limits on the masses of the heaviest fermions , though the precise values depend on the relative masses of these fermions and also the unknown gauge coupling strength , @xmath125 , of the @xmath6 groups to which the fermions couple .",
    "also we must be careful to point out that the rges describe the running of the yukawa couplings and , as we discuss in section  [ technicolour ] , the actual masses will be less than naively expected , due to the technicolour - like contribution from @xmath6 to the electroweak vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath126 . as we shall see",
    ", this will enable us to quite accurately predict the masses of some of the fermions we introduce in our model in section  [ su2*sun ] , since we have theoretical upper limits and experimental lower limits .",
    "technicolour theories @xcite have been proposed as an alternative to the higgs mechanism to provide a mass for the weak gauge bosons .",
    "this is based on the fact that qcd would provide a ( very small ) mass for these bosons without any higgs scalars .",
    "similarly any other confining @xmath6 gauge groups , with fermions which are non - trivial under @xmath127 , are expected to form fermion condensates which would contribute to the @xmath28 and @xmath31 masses . in our models",
    "the charge quantisation rule ensures that all fermions are non - trivial under @xmath0 .",
    "thus all @xmath6 groups in our models , which are coupled to fermions , will contribute to the weak boson masses .",
    "we stress that we are not proposing a technicolour model as such , but simply taking into account the unavoidable effect that adding an @xmath6 group has .",
    "we are assuming that the higgs sector of our models is the same as in the sm , i.e.  one higgs doublet , and that the fermion condensates have the same quantum numbers as the higgs doublet .",
    "then the vev due to the higgs field , @xmath128 , is related to the total vev , @xmath129 , and the contribution from @xmath6 due to fermion condensates , @xmath130 , by the relation : @xmath131 which is exactly the same as in technicolour models with a scalar @xcite .",
    "the fermion running masses , @xmath132 , are related to the higgs field vev in the usual way : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the yukawa coupling constant for the fermion f ( @xmath2 is used for both yukawa coupling and weak hypercharge but it should be obvious from the context which is being referred to ) .",
    "for quarks , the running mass is related to the pole mass , @xmath135 , by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the qcd fine structure constant at the pole mass . for quarks with a mass of order @xmath138",
    "we can approximate @xmath139 to give the approximate formula : @xmath140 this means that the pole mass of a heavy quark will be about 5% higher than the running mass .",
    "however , we will use eq .",
    "( [ quarkpole ] ) when calculating the pole masses of the quarks .    using the yukawa coupling infrared quasi - fixed point value as an upper bound",
    ", we must avoid any significant suppression of the top quark and possible fourth generation quark masses due to the reduction of @xmath128 below its sm value .",
    "we usually imagine taking @xmath141 and thus @xmath142 in fact we shall quote limits on fermion pole masses based on taking @xmath143 this gives the following relation for the pole mass of quark @xmath144 : @xmath145 in the approximation @xmath146 we get : @xmath147    upper limits for fermion masses are obtained by using quasi - fixed - point values for the yukawa coupling constants , @xmath134 , as determined from the rges in viable models with a desert above the tev scale . these infra - red fixed point yukawa couplings are of order unity .",
    "however for the purposes of investigating the behaviour of the gauge coupling constants , and especially to demonstrate that the @xmath0 coupling constant develops a landau pole in our model without new fermions ( section  [ only5sfails ] ) , we take a more generous single threshold of ten times the electroweak scale @xmath148 tev for all new fermions in that model . for our discussion in section  [ su2*sun ] of the model with a fourth generation of quarks",
    "we take the more stringent lower threshold value of @xmath138 , in order to demonstrate the absence of landau poles in this case .",
    "measurements of electroweak interactions are now accurate enough to be sensitive to loop corrections to propagators and vertex corrections .",
    "these effects are model dependent and can be sensitive to the values of some parameters such as fermion and higgs masses .",
    "so far the sm seems to be consistent with the precision electroweak measurements and obviously any other viable model should also agree with the data .",
    "we note , as discussed in @xcite , the data impose two important constraints on new fermion @xmath3 doublets in our models :    1 .",
    "the mass squared differences within any new fermion @xmath3 doublets must be small ( @xmath149 ) , in order that the predicted value of the @xmath118 parameter should not deviate too much from its experimental value close to unity .",
    "2 .   the number of new @xmath3 doublets is severely restricted by the measured value of the s parameter or its equivalent @xcite .",
    "in the sm fermions get a mass via the higgs mechanism . to do this in a general gauge group of the form @xmath150 where @xmath79 is any lie group and @xmath88 is a discrete group , using the sm higgs particle ,",
    "a left - handed fermion representation @xmath151 should occur together with the left - handed anti - fermion representations",
    "@xmath152,{\\bf 1},{\\bf \\overline{r}})$ ] and @xmath153,{\\bf 1 } , { \\bf \\overline{r}})$ ] .",
    "we shall refer to this as the mass grouping @xmath154 where * r * is an irreducible representation of @xmath79 .",
    "as explained in section  [ masslessfermions ] we assume that all fermions in our models , other than the leptons which have already been observed , get a mass by this mechanism .",
    "we shall now describe what consequences this has for anomaly cancellation in our models , where @xmath79 is a product of @xmath155 groups with @xmath156 .",
    "we consider the grouping @xmath154 for the gauge group @xmath157 where the irreducible representation * r * is made up of fundamental ( @xmath158 or @xmath159 ) or singlet representations of each factor @xmath155 .",
    "the contribution to each type of anomaly from this grouping , @xmath154 , is easily calculated , using the results of section  [ anoms ] , to be as follows .",

    "so we can see that the above grouping which is necessary to give a mass to the fermions also simplifies the anomaly constraints .",
    "in particular , if we take all fermions to be grouped in this way then we are only left with the single constraint for the absence of the mixed gauge - gravitational and gauge anomalies @xmath162 where j labels each grouping @xmath163 .",
    "there will also be no witten anomaly , since we must have an even number of @xmath3 doublets to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ allanoms ] ) .",
    "this follows from the charge quantisation rule eq .",

    "we will discuss the two possibilities : ( i ) that there are no new fermions beyond those of the sm and ( ii ) that there are new fermions which all couple to the @xmath32 gauge group .",
    "this latter possibility may seem to be tantamount to adding a completely separate sector to the sm rather than extending the sm , since the new fermions will be confined under a new gauge group .",
    "however , it is really no more a separate sector than the sm is three separate sectors ( one for each generation ) , since these extra fermions will still couple to the electro - weak group due to the charge quantisation rule . we will discuss the other possibility , that there are new fermions , some coupling to the @xmath32 gauge group and others not , in section  [ su2*sun ]      there is of course the possibility that there are no extra fermions associated with this enlarged group .",
    "if this is so then the only possible observations would be the detection of @xmath32 ` glueballs ' .",
    "in this case the @xmath32 gauge group would be decoupled from the @xmath10 and so the only way to observe the glueballs would be through their gravitational interactions .",
    "they could have been produced in the very early universe and the lightest state would be essentially stable since they could only decay via the gravitational interaction",
    ". therefore they would only be observable as dark matter .",
    "so this case is essentially uninteresting and will not be considered further .",
    "instead we turn to the possibility that there exist more types of fermions than have been currently observed and consider whether or not they can be incorporated into a consistent model .",
    "of course fermions all contribute to anomalies which must be cancelled .",
    "the fermions in the sm cancel all anomalies on their own ; so the extra fermions must cancel all anomalies amongst themselves .    as explained in section  [ simplifications ] the anomaly equations in our models",
    "are greatly simplified when all the fermions are massive due to the sm higgs mechanism .",

    "we must also have an even number of groupings so that the @xmath186 s combine to give an integer .",
    "this automatically ensures that there can be no witten anomaly as explained in section  [ simplifications ] .",
    "this can be done by using equal numbers of type @xmath177 and type @xmath187 groupings .",
    "the two smallest solutions are in fact : ( i ) one type @xmath177 grouping and one type @xmath187 grouping and ( ii ) two groupings of type @xmath177 and two of type @xmath187 .",

    "the smallest allowed solution with mass protected fermions is therefore solution ( ii ) with two groupings of type @xmath177 and two of type @xmath187 .",

    "@xmath192    [ only5ssoln ]    the fermion contribution to the ( first order)beta function for the @xmath0 running gauge coupling constant is proportional to @xmath193 .",
    "we therefore want to choose values of @xmath25 so as to minimise @xmath193 , in order that any @xmath0 landau pole is at as high an energy as possible .",
    "this gives us the best chance that the solution of table  [ only5ssoln ] will be perturbatively valid up to the planck scale and hence that our model will be self - consistent .",
    "however , this condition of minimising @xmath193 is also suggested by the small representation structure of the sm , as explained in section  [ smallreps ] . keeping in mind that the @xmath25 are integers , @xmath191 , and",
    "that the particles must be mass protected , we find that the minimum value of @xmath193 is given by @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",

    "this should provide an accurate enough upper limit for the threshold for our purposes .",
    "therefore , since the fermions will have the least effect on the running coupling constants if they are included at the highest possible threshold , we will assume that all these extra fermions can be included with a simple threshold at 1.7 tev .",
    "we can now check whether or not this model has a landau pole below the planck scale .",
    "there are four fine structure constants which we shall label by @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 corresponding to the four gauge groups @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "the fine structure constants , @xmath202 , are related to the gauge coupling constants , @xmath203 , by the relation @xmath204 .",
    "the equations governing the running coupling constants to first order in perturbation theory @xcite ( a good discussion of rges in the sm is given in @xcite ) can be integrated analytically to give @xmath205 where we calculate @xmath206 ( the running coupling constants at the energy scale @xmath207 ) in terms of @xmath208 .",

    "so we use the experimental values of the fine structure constants at @xmath138 ( including the top quark and higgs boson in the beta functions at this scale ) to calculate the coupling constants at 1.7 tev , where we include the new fermions , and then run the coupling constants up to the planck scale .",
    "this is a crude method since there would really be complicated threshold effects as each fermion was included .",
    "however these effects can reasonably be assumed to be small , relative to the changes in the coupling constants caused by the running from the electroweak scale to the planck scale , and so we will use this much simpler method .",

    "<S> we examine extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , basing our assumptions on what has already been observed ; we do nt consider anything fundamentally different , such as grand unification or supersymmetry , which is not directly suggested by the sm itself . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the possibility of additional low mass fermions ( relative to the planck mass ) and search for combinations of representations which do nt produce any gauge anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> generalisations of the sm weak hypercharge quantisation rule are used to specify the weak hypercharge , modulo 2 , for any given representation of the non - abelian part of the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> strong experimental constraints are put on our models , by using the renormalisation group equations to obtain upper limits on fermion masses and to check that there is no @xmath0 landau pole below the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> our most promising model contains a fourth generation of quarks without leptons and can soon be tested experimentally . </S>"
