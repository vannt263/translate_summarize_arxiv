    "recently , few - electron systems in nearly two - dimensional semiconductor structures has been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental research [ 1 ] . in the present paper",
    ", we continue a programme , initiated in [ 2 , 3 ] , aimed at providing reliable analytical estimates for the energy levels of model two - dimensional systems on the basis of a simple physical picture for the states .",
    "the idea is to use the inverse of angular momentum as an expansion parameter in schrodinger equation , thus obtaining nonperturbative series for the energy and the wave function .",
    "variants of this method have been widely used in atomic and nuclear physics [ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "the static exciton in a magnetic field was considered in [ 2 ] .",
    "energy levels were computed as a function of the mass ratio and the magnetic field .",
    "comparison with estimates obtained from two - point pade approximants [ 6 ] yielded excellent results at any magnetic field strength .    in paper [ 3 ] , a model of three electrons in a quantum dot with @xmath3 repulsion , considered previously in [ 7 ] , was studied .",
    "the @xmath1-method provided analytical estimates for the energy and a set of approximate quantum numbers to label the states .",
    "we will make use below of many of the results obtained in [ 3 ] .",
    "systems of two and three electrons in a two - dimensional parabolic quantum dot are to be studied in the present paper .",
    "a magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the dot s plane . in this problem",
    ", there is only one relevant parameter , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the characteristic coulomb energy , and @xmath6 is expressed in terms of the dot and the cyclotron frequencies as @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 will be called the oscillator limit , and @xmath9  the wigner limit , suggesting that we are dealing with a few - electron version of the wigner solid . in typical quantum dot experiments ,",
    "@xmath10 .",
    "the physical picture emerging from the @xmath1-expansion is the following . in the leading approximation ,",
    "the electrons are located at the vertices of a regular polygon , which side minimises the total classical energy ( centrifugal plus potential ) .",
    "the first corrections take account of small ( harmonic ) vibrations around the equilibrium configuration .",
    "higher corrections come from anharmonic oscillations .",
    "this picture is supported by numerical calculations for few - electron systems not only in the strong coupling regime [ 8 ] , but in the region @xmath10 as well [ 9 ] .    a special comment deserves paper [ 9 ] , in which the few - electron problem in eckardt coordinates is treated quasiclassically .",
    "although the starting points are far apart , our results are very similar up to the harmonic approximation .",
    "the main difference between paper [ 9 ] and ours is the expansion parameter , which is @xmath11 in [ 9 ] , and @xmath1 in our work .",
    "higher order of the quasiclassical expansion are not reported in [ 9 ] .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the @xmath1-method .",
    "results for two and three electrons are shown in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "we start with the dimensionless hamiltonian governing the two - dimensional motion of @xmath12 electrons in a quantum dot of energy @xmath13 , and in a magnetic field normal to the plane of motion ,    @xmath14    the conventions are as follows .",
    "@xmath15 is the electron effective mass , @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath17 is the effective gyromagnetic factor , @xmath18 is the @xmath19 component of the total spin of the system , @xmath7 is the effective dot frequency .",
    "the length unit is @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the dielectric constant .",
    "the actual parameter governing the problem is @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath24 , the levels are small perturbations around oscillator energies . on the other hand , when @xmath25 , the energy minimum is reached in a classical configuration which can be seen as a few - body model of a wigner crystal .",
    "both limiting situations conduce to exactly solvable problems .    through the introduction of jacobi",
    "coordinates , the center - of - mass motion is separated from the internal motion ,    @xmath26    where    @xmath27    we have written @xmath28 in terms of rotational invariant coordinates , i.e. , the moduli of the jacobi vectors and the angles between them .",
    "the jacobi vectors were defined as ,    @xmath29    where the reduced masses are @xmath30 .",
    "the angle between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is denoted @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath0 labels the total internal angular momentum .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath34 are simply ,    @xmath35    we shall obtain approximate expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath28 .",
    "we consider states with high @xmath36 values , which are the relevant states at high magnetic fields .",
    "it is intuitively evident that at high @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the solution of the schrodinger equation may be organised as a power series in @xmath1 .",
    "a scaling of dimensions such that @xmath39 makes evident the dependence of each term on @xmath36 .",
    "the scaled hamiltonian is written as    @xmath40    where we have introduced the `` renormalised '' coupling constant @xmath41 . when taking the formal limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 is kept fixed to take account of coulomb repulsion nonperturbatively .",
    "in what follows , we consider only the two- and three - electron problems . the only term surviving in the r.h.s of ( 7 ) when @xmath42 is the effective potential .",
    "its absolute minimum gives a classical contribution to the energy .",
    "it is reached in a configuration where the particles sit at the corners of a regular polygon . in this configuration ,",
    "the effective potential is a function of @xmath44 only ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the angle between particles @xmath47 and @xmath48 , measured from the c.m .",
    "minimisation of @xmath49 leads to an equilibrium value for @xmath44 , @xmath50 .",
    "the equilibrium values of the others coordinates , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , are determined from geometry .",
    "higher contributions to the energy come from relaxing the equilibrium configuration , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the r.h.s . of ( 7 ) may , thus , be expanded as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 describes in general harmonic oscillations in fictitious magnetic fields , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , etc account for anharmonicities .    for the spatial wave function and the scaled energy ( related to @xmath60 ) ,",
    "we write series like ( 9 )    @xmath61    these expressions are substituted into schrodinger equation , leading to the chain of uncoupled equations ,    @xmath62    higher corrections to the energy are obtained from ordinary perturbation theory , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , etc .",
    "are interpreted as perturbations .",
    "below , we present results for two and three electrons .",
    "for two particles , there is only one jacobi coordinate , @xmath63 .",
    "it s equilibrium value ( the modulus ) satisfies the equation    @xmath64    writing @xmath65 , and substituting into the r.h.s . of ( 7 ) , we obtain the operator coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc .",
    "in particular    @xmath66    where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 . note that in the oscillator limit @xmath70 , whereas in the wigner limit @xmath71 approaches the classical result @xmath72 [ 10 ] .    to this order",
    ", the spatial wave function is written as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the polar angle associated to the vector @xmath76 . under a permutation of particles @xmath75 changes by @xmath77 ,",
    "thus even @xmath36 correspond to unpolarised spin states , @xmath78 , and odd @xmath36  to polarised states , @xmath79 .",
    "the operators @xmath80 , @xmath81 , can be written in general as    @xmath82    their matrix elements can be straightforwardly computed .",
    "let us write the results for the first nonzero terms of the series ( 11 ) in the present case ,    @xmath83    @xmath84 labels the number of excitation quanta .",
    "it is a good approximate quantum number of the problem in the whole interval @xmath85 .",
    "notice that all the @xmath86 with @xmath87 go to zero in both the oscillator and wigner limits .",
    "thus , the @xmath1-expansion provides a nice interpolation scheme .    in figure 1a , we compare different approximations to the r.h.s . of ( 7 )",
    "computed according to the series ( 11 ) .",
    "the excited state with @xmath88 and @xmath89 is shown .",
    "convergence is excellent .",
    "we can not distinguish among the curves containing the corrections @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( printed as dashed lines ) from the solid line corresponding to @xmath92 . even at a low value of @xmath36 as 3",
    ", @xmath90 introduces corrections lower than 1% , and @xmath91  lower than 0.3% .",
    "the relative weight of @xmath91 in @xmath93 is shown in figure 1b .    in figure 2 ,",
    "the energy @xmath94 is compared with the estimate obtained in [ 11 ] from a two - point pade approximant .",
    "we expect this approximant to approach the exact energy from above , and to differ from it in no more than a few parts in @xmath95 [ 11 ] .",
    "the results are consistent with the expectations .",
    "notice that the conditions for the application of perturbation theory are fulfilled at any @xmath21 when @xmath96 , i.e. the distances between adjacent levels , computed from @xmath92 , are much greater than the corrections @xmath97 .",
    "below , we will see that in the three - body problem the corrections , although being small , may cause a partial rearrangement of the spectrum .",
    "in the three electron system , there are two distances @xmath44 , @xmath98 , and one angle , @xmath99 .",
    "the equilibrium configuration is an equilateral triangle ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , which side satisfies the equation    @xmath102    at its minimum , @xmath103 , thus providing a leading approximation to the energy    @xmath104    expanding around one of the two equivalent configurations , i.e. fixing @xmath105 for example , we obtain a series like ( 9 ) in which the first operator coefficients are given by    @xmath106    @xmath107    @xmath108    the hamiltonian @xmath57 , which is to be taken as zeroth order hamiltonian , describes a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath109 in the variable @xmath110 , plus a combination of harmonic oscillators and a fictitious magnetic field in the variables @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "note that the `` magnetic field '' comes from the coupling between the angular momentum and the variable @xmath99 .",
    "we may use a symmetric gauge to describe the fictitious field .",
    "the hamiltonian is transformed according to @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath115 takes the symmetric form    @xmath116    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are    @xmath119    in which @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath84 and @xmath122 are respectively principal and magnetic quantum numbers in the fictitious field . in the oscillator",
    "limit : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , whereas in the wigner limit : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . at finite @xmath129",
    "there is no degeneracy between the states of @xmath57 , thus we may use nondegenerate perturbation theory to compute corrections .    we shall identify which of the levels ( @xmath130 ) may describe electron states .",
    "this set of quantum numbers will serve as approximate quantum numbers for the three - electron problem . at intermediate couplings , a small mixing between the states of @xmath115",
    "will be induced by the corrections @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "let us recall the symmetry requirements for three - electron wave functions . a spatially antisymmetric wave function , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 accounts for global rotations , corresponds to a spin - polarised state , @xmath135 , whereas a mixed - symmetry @xmath136 is related to an unpolarised spin state , @xmath137 .",
    "symmetry transformations shall be expressed in terms of the variables we are using , i.e. @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "additionally , to identify physical states , @xmath136 shall be compared with oscillator functions at @xmath141 .",
    "a detailed analysis is presented in the appendix of paper [ 3 ] , to which we refer the reader .",
    "the main conclusion is that in the @xmath142 plane , the spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states occupy the lines @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is an integer .",
    "for example , let us consider the first states with @xmath145 when @xmath146 .",
    "the lowest state is ( @xmath147)=(0,0,0 ) .",
    "it corresponds to both one antisymmetric and one symmetric state . in our scheme , as tunnelling effects are not included , they are degenerated in energy .",
    "of course , only the antisymmetric state may correspond to a state of three electrons .",
    "very near to the lowest state there is the mixed - symmetry doublet , ( 0,0,1 ) . at excitation energies near 2",
    ", there are the levels ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 1,0,1 ) , ( 0,0,-1 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) and ( 0,1,1 ) .",
    "symmetric and antisymmetric states have @xmath148 .",
    "the next set of states is at excitation energies near 4 , etc .    up to this order",
    ", the energy computed from @xmath149 leads to results very similar to that reported in [ 9 ] .",
    "that is , when @xmath10 the relative error of the lowest state with a given @xmath36 represents only a few percents of the total energy at @xmath89 , and decreases considerably as @xmath36 is increased .",
    "the reader may look at figures 3 and 4 of paper [ 9 ] in quality of examples .",
    "let us study @xmath150 when @xmath21 is varied from 0 to @xmath151 .",
    "as in the two - electron problem , the higher corrections , @xmath97 , go to zero in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 limits .",
    "however , for certain levels , a rearrangement of the spectrum may take place .",
    "for example , let us consider spatially antisymmetric states with @xmath152 , where @xmath144 is positive and high enough .",
    "the lowest state in this sector has quantum numbers ( 0,0,0 ) .",
    "we show in figure 3 the excitation energies of three states with quantum numbers ( 0,0,3 ) , ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 0,1,0 ) .",
    "their energies are @xmath153 , @xmath71 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "transitions among these states induced by @xmath131 , @xmath132 , etc",
    ". may occur at @xmath155 , thus resulting in a rearrangement of levels . to compute their energies at the intermediate values of @xmath21 where the intersections occur",
    ", we shall resolve the degeneracy by means of degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "on the other hand , there are levels , in particular those with numbers ( 0,0,0 ) , for which we can apply the @xmath1-expansion continuously from @xmath156 to @xmath151 .",
    "let us compute the coefficient @xmath90 for a state with quantum numbers ( 0,0,0 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath157 and @xmath36 large enough .",
    "these are the relevant states at high magnetic fields .",
    "we shall compute the matrix elements entering the expression    @xmath158    taking into account the explicit form of @xmath131 , i.e.    @xmath159    where    @xmath160    we obtain that the sum over intermediate states in ( 29 ) contains only a few terms .",
    "the following result for @xmath90 arises ,    @xmath161    where    @xmath162    and the matrix elements involving @xmath138 are ordinary oscillator matrix elements , that is @xmath163 , etc .",
    "note that , as mentioned , @xmath164 in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 limits .    in figure 4",
    "we compare the @xmath1-expansion and the two - point pade approximant @xmath165 of [ 11 ] for the lowest antisymmetric state with @xmath145 . as in the two - electron case ,",
    "the relative error is of the same order of the incertitude of the pade estimate , i.e. a few parts in @xmath95 .",
    "we show in figure 5 the relative weight of @xmath90 in @xmath166 . for states with still higher values of @xmath36 , the relative magnitude of the contribution of @xmath90 decreases considerably .",
    "we have computed the energy levels of two and three electrons in an ideal parabolic two - dimensional quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "states with high angular momentum and a low number of excitation ( vibrational ) quanta were considered .",
    "the energy was found as a series in the `` small '' parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the series exhibits good convergence properties even at @xmath89 .    at still lower values of the angular momentum",
    "the method is not applicable .",
    "however , we can obtain reliable analytic estimations by means of an alternative procedure : the two - point pade approximants , which are extremely simply constructed for the low - lying states [ 11 ] .",
    "@xmath1-expansions and pade approximants were shown to give similar results at intermediate @xmath36 values , i.e. at @xmath89 .",
    "other problems are currently being treated along these lines .",
    "for example , the effects of anyonic statistics on the energy levels of two quasiparticles in a quantum dot may be straightforwardly studied by means of the @xmath1-method [ 12 ] .",
