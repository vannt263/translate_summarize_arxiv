    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are a small class ( 4 confirmed and one candidate ) of high - energy transient discovered through their emission of bright x - ray/@xmath2-ray bursts which repeat on timescales of seconds to years . originally confused with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs see e.g.  fishman and meegan 1995 ) , sgrs get their name from their burst properties that distinguish them from classical grbs ; namely their softer spectral energy distribution and repetition of bursts .",
    "in addition to being prolific burst emitters , sgrs are also persistent x - ray sources . for three objects ,",
    "the x - ray radiation is modulated by the spin of the underlying neutron star . in each case",
    ", the star is spinning down rapidly , indicative of a strong magnetic field ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "in fact , it was this observation that clinched the now widely accepted magnetar model for sgrs ( thompson and duncan 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "a magnetar is a strongly magnetized neutron star ( @xmath3 @xmath4 g ) where the magnetic energy exceeds all other sources of free energy in the system . unlike ordinary radio pulsars ,",
    "the rotational energy loss in sgrs is insignificant compared to their overall energy output .",
    "it is the decay of the strong field of the sgr that powers both their burst and persistent emissions .",
    "in addition to the four confirmed sgrs , there is another small class of neutron stars dubbed the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) that were proposed by thompson and duncan ( 1996 ) as magnetar candidates .",
    "the axps share a number of characteristics with the sgrs in terms of their persistent x - ray emission properties , and two members were recently discovered to emit sgr - like bursts ( gavriil et al .  2002 ; kaspi et al .",
    "the recent burst detection results solidify the common nature of axps and sgrs . a review of axps will be presented within this volume ( gavriil et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "here , i will review the salient properties of sgrs including burst characteristics , persistent and pulsed x - ray emission , and the effects of burst activity on sgr persistent emission properties .",
    "associations with supernova remnants and massive star clusters will be discussed elsewhere in this volume ( gaensler 2003 ) .",
    "the defining behavior of sgrs is their repetitive emission of luminous soft @xmath2-ray bursts .",
    "typically , the bursts last @xmath50.1 sec and have energy spectra ( e @xmath625 kev ) that can be modeled with an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) having temperatures 20@xmath140 kev ( e.g. et al .",
    "2001 , aptekar et al .",
    "2001 ) . at lower energies , however , this model fails to fit the spectrum ( e.g.  olive et al .",
    "the spectral temperatures show little or no variation with intensity , between bursts , at different epochs , or between sources .",
    "the burst energies follow a power - law number distribution ( dn / de @xmath7 e@xmath8",
    "[ cheng et al .",
    "1996 , g et al .",
    "1999 ) from @xmath510@xmath9 ergs up to at least @xmath510@xmath10 ergs , consistent with a so - called self - organized critical system ( e.g.  earthquakes , solar flares , etc . ) where the burst energy reservoir greatly exceeds the energy output within any given burst .",
    "burst active states of sgrs , often referred to as outbursts , range in duration from a few days to several months . during these episodes , they emit anywhere from a handful to several hundred bursts .",
    "the burst rate histories of the four sgrs spanning three decades are shown in figure 1 .",
    "these lightcurves are comprised of burst detections from several different detectors having different sensitivity limits .",
    "the non - uniformity of the burst sampling becomes significant when comparing separate active episodes that were viewed with different detectors .",
    "for example , given a stationary burst energy ( and peak flux ) distribution with a power - law slope of @xmath11 , an increase in the detector sensitivity by a factor 10 yields a factor @xmath55 increase in the overall rate .",
    "on two occasions , more energetic bursts or giant flares were recorded one each from sgr  0526@xmath166 on 1979 march 5 ( mazets et al .",
    "1979 ) and sgr  1900@xmath014 on 1998 august 27 ( hurley et al .",
    "the lightcurve of the august 27 flare is shown in figure 2 .",
    "each of these extraordinary events had a bright ( @xmath510@xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 ) , spectrally hard initial spike followed by a softer , several minute long tail showing coherent pulsations at 8 and 5 s , respectively .",
    "more recently , an intermediate flare ( @xmath510@xmath14 ergs ) lasting 40 s was recorded from sgr  1900@xmath014 on 2001 april 18 ( guidorzi et al.2001 ) , suggesting a continuum of bursts energies rather than a dichotomy of bursts and flares ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "recently , discrete features in the spectra of bursts from two sgrs , 1900@xmath014 and 1806@xmath120 have been reported . in the case of sgr",
    "1900@xmath014 , an emission line at @xmath56.5 kev was discovered ( strohmayer and ibrahim 2000 ) during the onset of a single , bright burst .",
    "no candidate line features in other bursts have been reported from this source since .",
    "for sgr  1806@xmath120 , an absorption line feature was found near @xmath55 kev in a small subset of spectra taken from selected bursts ( ibrahim et al .",
    "the presence of less significant features at higher energies consistent with a harmonic relationship is intriguing , but their significance ( for individual bursts ) is not convincing .",
    "all sgrs are associated with persistent x - ray counterparts ; three of them have quiescent luminosities @xmath510@xmath9 ergs s@xmath13 ( murakami et al .  1994 ;",
    "rothschild et al .  1993 ; hurley et al .",
    "1999b ) , while the quiescent flux level of sgr  1627@xmath141 has not yet been reached ( c.  kouveliotou , private communication ) .",
    "the spectra of sgr  1627@xmath141 and sgr  1806@xmath120 can be modeled with a power - law ( woods et al .",
    "1999a ; mereghetti et al .",
    "2000 ) while sgr  1900@xmath014 requires an additional blackbody component ( @xmath15 @xmath50.5 kev [ woods et al .",
    "1999b ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "the presence of a blackbody component in sgr  0526@xmath166 is marginal ( kulkarni et al .",
    "currently , we are investigating the stability of the power - law photon index in sgr  1900@xmath014 .",
    "our preliminary finding is that the photon index evolves from @xmath51.0 to @xmath52.2 within a few years .",
    ".quiescent spectral and temporal properties of the soft gamma repeater x - ray counterparts .",
    "see text for references . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     within the group of four x - ray tails following bright bursts detected from sgr  1900@xmath014 ( table 2 ) , we find a number of similarities and some slight differences indicating possible trends ( within the restrictions of small number statistics ) . in all cases ,",
    "the thermal component becomes hotter while the power - law component brightens following three of the four bursts .",
    "the ratio of tail energy to burst energy is consistent with being constant among the group ( figure 7 [ lenters et al .  2003 ] ) .",
    "timing anomalies and pulse profile changes are seen following the two most energetic bursts and the pulse fraction increases for the three weakest .",
    "an interesting trend which arises from this small set of x - ray tails is that the pulse fraction enhancement in the separate x - ray tails appears to correlate with the magnitude of the thermal contribution to the x - ray flux .",
    "that is , tails with the highest relative blackbody flux show the largest increase in pulse fraction .",
    "given the small numbers , however , more examples are required to establish this trend .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    sgr  1627@xmath141 was discovered in 1998 june when it was observed to burst more than 100 times in a short span of about a month ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998b ; woods et al .",
    "no bursts from this sgr have been seen since 1998 august . shortly after the onset of burst activity in this sgr ,",
    "an x - ray counterpart was identified and observed to fade in brightness over the next two years .",
    "dissimilar to the observed flux variations in sgr  1900@xmath014 , the decay in the lightcurve of sgr  1627@xmath141 proceeds on a much longer timescale of order years and has yet to `` bottom out '' at a baseline flux level .",
    "this object shows that the response of sgrs to burst activity varies between sources .",
    "we have summarized the recent observations of dynamic behavior in the persistent and pulsed emission from sgr  1900@xmath014 , sgr  1806@xmath120 and sgr  1627@xmath141 .",
    "now , we will discuss what constraints these observations place on the models for the sgrs , in particular the magnetar model .",
    "the torque enhancements in sgr  1806@xmath120 and sgr  1900@xmath014 do not directly correlate with the burst activity . in the context of the magnetar model ,",
    "the abscence of a direct correlation between these two parameters has strong implications for the underlying physics behind each phenomenon .",
    "the magnetar model postulates that the bursting activity in sgrs is a result of fracturing of the outer crust of a highly magnetized neutron star .",
    "furthermore , the majority of models proposed to explain the torque variability in magnetars invoke crustal motion and/or low - level seismic activity ( thompson and blaes 1998 ; harding et al .  1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "since there is no direct correlation between the burst activity and torque variability , then either ( @xmath16 ) the seismic activities leading to each observable are decoupled from one another , or ( @xmath17 ) at least one of these phenomena is _ not _ related to seismic activity ( woods et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the dramatic change in the pulse profile of sgr  1900@xmath014 in conjunction with the giant flare requires a substantial change in the magnetic field of the neutron star ( woods et al .",
    "2001 ; thompson et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the magnetar model , there are at least two possible ways that this can happen",
    ". one possibility proposed by thompson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is that a twist in the magnetosphere is generated following the flare , driving a persistent current which produces an optically thick scattering screen at some substantial distance ( @xmath510 @xmath18 ) from the stellar surface . in this model ,",
    "the surface field geometry remains complex at all times .",
    "the pulse profile , however , simplifies when the scattering screen is present ( i.e.  after the flare ) .",
    "the scattering screen must have the properties of redistributing the radiation in phase , but not in energy in order to account for the reemergence of the blackbody component after the august 27 tail fades away ( thompson et al.2002 ) .",
    "the decay of this magnetospheric twist is believed to be several years .",
    "an alternative scenario involves restructuring of the surface magnetic field geometry . in this picture , the field geometry is complex prior to the flare and relaxes to a more dipolar structure following the event giving rise to the observed change in pulse profile .",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2002 ) recently investigated each of these scenarios in detail , noting advantages and disadvantages for each model . in this work",
    ", they have identified further observational tests involving the energy spectrum of the emission before and after the flare .",
    "simulations of the expected behavior and an analysis of the spectral evolution of sgr  1900@xmath014 are currently underway .",
    "currently , only four clear x - ray tails have been detected from sgr  1900@xmath014 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is a potential correlation between the relative abundance of thermal emission in the tail and the enhancement of the pulse fraction .",
    "this correlation , if proven correct with the detection and analysis of several more sgr tails , would provide a strong argument for heating of a localized region on the neutron star during bursts ( thompson et al .",
    "2000 ; lyubarsky et al .",
    "2002 ) .    since the pulse fraction increases during three of the four x - ray tails detected from sgr  1900@xmath014 , the flux enhancement must be anisotropic about the star in these cases . for the august 29 and",
    "april 28 burst tails , the location of the heating is also constrained ( lenters et al .",
    "2003 ) . in each of these events",
    ", we have precise pulse phase information prior to , during , and after the tail . for both bursts ,",
    "the phase of the pulsations during the tail does not shift relative to the pulse phase prior to the burst .",
    "this requires that the localized region on the neutron star with the largest relative flux enhancement is within or nearby the region giving rise to the persistent x - ray pulse peak ( e.g.  the polar cap ) . in the magnetar model ,",
    "the burst emission is due to the build up of stress in the stellar crust from the evolving magnetic field and the eventual release of this stress when the crust fractures ( thompson and duncan 1995 ) .",
    "localized heating of the polar cap requires that the fracture site of the burst be at the same location .",
    "since these two events do not occur at all near the same pulse phase ( lenters et al .",
    "2003 ) , the burst emission arising from near the surface must be significantly scattered .",
    "an alternative model ( lyutikov 2002 ) invokes a magnetospheric rather than crustal origin for the bursts .",
    "this model is attractive in that it negates the need for large angle scattering of the burst emission and provides a natural explanation for the preferential brightening of the polar cap regions .",
    "contrary to the short - lived x - ray tails seen following sgr  1900@xmath014 bursts , the much longer timescale flux decay in sgr  1627@xmath141 following its 1998 outburst shows that the effects of burst activity on the persistent emission of sgrs is not uniform among the class .",
    "as another example , the recent outburst of the axp 1e  2259@xmath0586 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2002 ) shows several source parameters that changed as a result . some of the observed changes ( e.g.  persistent and pulsed x - ray flux increases ) are similar to those seen in sgr  1900@xmath014 whereas others are not . as discussed above , episodes where the properties of these objects are rapidly evolving are paramount in determining the nature of these sources and the physical mechanism driving the dynamics of the source spectral and temporal properties .",
    "the diversity in sgr / axp outbursts observed thus far necessitates detailed study of each outburst in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the class as a whole .",
    "this in turn requires diligent monitoring and prompt follow - up of each source when they become active .",
