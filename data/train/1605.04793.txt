    "in this letter , we consider the numerical integration of the partial differential equation ( pde ) in the form @xmath0 where subscripts @xmath1 or @xmath2 denote the partial differentiation with respect to @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the variational derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the periodic boundary condition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "when the derivatives of @xmath7 do not appear in @xmath8 , the equation   is called the ( nonlinear ) klein  gordon equation in light - cone coordinates .",
    "moreover , the class of pdes in the form   is closely related to the ostrovsky equation  @xcite , the short pulse equation  @xcite , etc . for their numerical treatments , due to the possible indefiniteness caused by the spatial derivative in the left - hand side , it seems a systematic numerical framework for   is yet to be investigated , though a few exceptions for specific cases can be found ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this letter , we focus on a certain class of conservative methods . under the periodic boundary condition , the target equation   has the conserved quantity  @xmath8 : @xmath9^l_0 - \\int^l_0 u_t u_{tx } { \\mathrm{d}}x =   - \\int^l_0 u_t u_{tx } { \\mathrm{d}}x = 0 .",

    "a numerical scheme is called conservative when it replicates such a conservation property ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical solutions obtained by such schemes are often more stable than those of general - purpose methods . there , the crucial point for the discrete conservation law is the skew - symmetry of difference operator , which corresponds to that of the differential operator ; when one tries to construct a conservative finite - difference scheme for the equation  , the differential operator @xmath11 in left - hand side must be replaced by one of the skew - symmetric difference operators , for example , the central difference operators , the compact finite difference operators  ( see , e.g. , kanazawa  matsuo  yaghchi  @xcite ) , and the fourier - spectral difference operator ( see , e.g. , fornberg  @xcite ) .",
    "this is intrinsically indispensable , at least to the best of the present authors knowledge .",
    "this , however , at the same time , leads to an undesirable side effect that the numerical solutions tend to suffer from spatial oscillations .    in this letter , to work around this technical difficulty , we propose a novel `` average - difference method , '' which is tough against such undesirable spatial oscillations .",
    "a similar method has been , in fact , already investigated by nagisa  @xcite . however , he used this method for advection - type equations , and concluded the method was unfortunately not more advantageous than existing methods .",
    "in this letter , we instead construct an average - difference method for the pde  , and combine it with the idea of conservation mentioned above .",
    "then we compare the proposed and existing methods in the case of the linear klein  gordon equation , which is the simplest case with @xmath12 . as a result ,",
    "the average - difference type method is successfully superior to the existing methods in view of the phase speed of each frequency component .",
    "the conservative scheme for the pde   can be constructed in the spirit of discrete variational derivative method ( dvdm ) ( see , the monograph  @xcite for details ) . there , one utilizes the concept of the `` discrete variational derivative '' and skew - symmetric difference operators . the symbol @xmath13 denotes the approximation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the temporal and spatial mesh sizes , respectively . here",
    ", we assume the discrete periodic boundary condition @xmath17 , and thus , we use the notation @xmath18 .",
    "let us introduce the spatial central difference operator @xmath19 and the temporal forward difference operator @xmath20 : @xmath21    the discrete counterpart @xmath22 of the functional @xmath23 can be defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an appropriate approximation of @xmath26 .",
    "then , the discrete variational derivative @xmath27 is defined as a function satisfying @xmath28 for the construction of such one , see  @xcite . by using the discrete variational derivative",
    ", we can construct a conservative scheme @xmath29 as stated in the introduction , the key ingredient here is the skew - symmetry of the central difference operator .",
    "suppose the numerical scheme   has a solution @xmath13 under the periodic boundary condition .",
    "then , it satisfies @xmath30 .",
    "_ thanks to the definition   of the discrete variational derivative , we can follow the line of the discussion   as follows : @xmath31 whose right - hand side vanishes due to the skew - symmetry of the central difference operator  @xmath19 : @xmath32 holds for any @xmath33 .",
    "_    the discrete conservation law can also be proved similarly for the other skew - symmetric difference operators .",
    "in this section , we propose the novel method . there , instead of the single skew - symmetric difference operator , we employ the pair of the forward difference and average operators : @xmath34 the average - difference method for the equation   can be written in the form @xmath35 the name `` average - difference '' comes from the idea of approximating @xmath11 with the pair of @xmath36 ; this makes sense for more general pdes , and thus is independent of any conservation properties .",
    "still , in this letter we focus on   and  .",
    "although it is constructed in the spirit of dvdm , now the forward difference operator @xmath37 loses the apparent skew - symmetry , and accordingly , the proof of the discrete conservation law becomes unobvious .",
    "a similar proof can be found in nagisa  @xcite .",
    "suppose the average - difference method   has a solution @xmath13 under the periodic boundary condition .",
    "then , it satisfies @xmath30 .",

    "in order to conduct a detailed analysis , we consider the simplest case , the linear klein  gordon equation @xmath44 under the periodic domain with the period @xmath45 .",
    "the exact solution of the linear klein  gordon equation   can be formally written in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the imaginary unit , and @xmath48 is determined by the initial condition @xmath49 : @xmath50 in view of the superposition principle , we consider the single component @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .      in order to clarify the difference between the standard conservative method and proposed method , we consider the following three semi - discretizations @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . here , @xmath57 denotes the fourier - spectral difference operator , i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is obtained by the discrete fourier transform : @xmath60 note that , the implicit midpoint method for the semi - discretizations above coincide with the numerical schemes constructed in the previous sections .",
