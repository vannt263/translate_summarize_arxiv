    "the apparent accelerating expansion of our universe is , according to the standard model of cosmology , best described by the presence of a dark energy component with a strong negative pressure , dominating the gravitational physics on large scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "however , our knowledge of the actual properties of this dark energy is very limited , and a number of open questions remain  is dark energy dynamic or not ? does it take part in clustering ? is the dark energy s behaviour scale - dependent ? to name but a few .    in order to distinguish between various models of dark energy",
    ", we must appeal to a variety of observational tests , each probing a different aspect of the dark energy s dynamics .",
    "luminosity and angular diameter distance measurements using , respectively , type ia supernovae and the baryon acoustic oscillation scale have yielded  and will continue to yield  interesting information on the dark energy s influence on the expansion history of the universe .",

    "falls the so - called spherical collapse model  @xcite , which , as the name suggests , is a model of gravitational collapse simplified by the assumption of spherical symmetry . in the model ,",
    "a spherically symmetric overdense region with uniform density evolves to a configuration of infinite density under its own gravity , and a gravitationally bound object is said to be formed .",
    "the original spherical collapse model was constructed under the assumption of an einstein  de sitter ( eds ) universe .",
    "already by the 1980s and the early 1990s the model had been extended to include a cosmological constant  @xcite , and later for quintessence  @xcite .",
    "more analyses have followed since then , and all reached the conclusion that dark energy has an important impact on the formation of gravitationally bound structures  @xcite .",
    "the topic appears to have gained momentum again during the past year  @xcite mainly because of the positive expectation that these results will be testable against observations in the not - too - distant future  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate by means of the spherical collapse model how a generic dark energy component characterised by a constant equation of state parameter @xmath7 and sound speed @xmath1 affects the formation of cosmic structures . in previous studies",
    "the dark energy component is generally allowed to take on different values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the sound speed @xmath1 is invariably assumed to be either approaching the speed of light so that the dark energy is essentially homogeneous , or exactly vanishing so that the dark energy fluid is comoving with the matter component .",
    "these assumptions undoubtedly simplify the calculations considerably and represent the two limiting behaviours of dark energy clustering .",
    "however , the case of a general sound speed remains interesting in that it introduces a scale - dependence into the problem .",
    "identifying this dependence will give us yet another pointer to the true nature of dark energy .",
    "here , we demonstrate for the first time how to incorporate a dark energy component with an arbitrary sound speed into the spherical collapse model ( in an approximate way ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : ii ]",
    "we introduce the evolution equations for the spherical collapse and the corresponding equations of motion for the dark energy component . in section  [ sec : linear ] we discuss dark energy clustering within the framework of linear perturbation theory .",
    "section  [ sec : iii ] contains our numerical results .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : iv ] .",
    "in its most basic formulation , the spherical collapse model assumes there exists a spherically symmetric overdense region on top of an otherwise uniform background matter density field .",
    "the overdense region is characterised by a physical radius @xmath8 at the initial ( conformal ) time @xmath9 , and a uniform initial energy density @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the energy density of the background matter field .",
    "this is our spherical `` top hat '' perturbation , and the mass contained within is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the present time , and we have defined @xmath14 as the comoving radius of the top hat .    the evolution of the physical top hat radius @xmath15 with respect to _ cosmic time _",
    "@xmath16 is described by the familiar equation of motion @xmath17 where we have incorporated in the equation the possibility of a second energy component with a nonzero pressure denoted by the subscript @xmath18 .",
    "this second component is uniform inside the top hat region defined by the radius @xmath15 , and shall be our dark energy component in this work .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ddotr ] ) can be equivalently expressed as an equation of motion for for the comoving top hat radius @xmath19 with respect to conformal time @xmath20 , @xmath21 , \\label{eq : xdotdot}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the conformal hubble parameter , and @xmath24 is the square of dark energy sound speed defined in the dark energy fluid s rest frame . note that in identifying @xmath1 in equations  ( [ eq : xdotdot ] ) and  ( [ eq : cs2 ] ) as the rest frame sound speed , we have implicitly assumed that we are dealing only with length scales much smaller than the hubble length , and that averaged over the spherical region , there is no bulk flow of dark energy relative to the dark matter fluid .",
    "we also assume @xmath25 to be constant in time and space .",
    "since the total mass of matter inside the top hat @xmath26 is conserved , the top hat matter density contrast @xmath27 can be easily expressed as a function of the top hat radius , @xmath28 ^ 3   -1= ( 1 + \\delta^{\\rm th}_{m , i } )   \\ !",
    "\\left[\\frac{x_i}{x(\\tau ) } \\right]^3   -1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the dark energy density contrast @xmath29 , two limiting cases have been studied in the literature .",
    "the first is the non - clustering limit , in which the dark energy sound speed @xmath1 is taken to approach the speed of light , see e.g. @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath30 is effectively zero , so that the role of dark energy in the spherical collapse enters only through the hubble expansion of the background . ) and  ( [ eq : nonclustering ] ) . ]",
    "the second is the `` comoving '' or clustering limit , in which the dark energy sound speed is exactly zero , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the euler equation for the dark energy fluid in this limit is identical to its counterpart for a nonrelativistic dark matter fluid .",
    "this means that the bulk velocity fields of the two fluids are the same ; the fluids are thus said to be comoving .",
    "note that this observation does not imply the dark energy and dark matter density contrasts evolve in the same manner , since the conditions for energy conservation differ between the two fluids .",
    "it does , however , imply a conservation law for the dark energy component inside the top hat , so that the evolution of @xmath31 can be simply expressed as @xmath32 or @xmath33 in terms of comoving quantities .    strictly speaking , these two limiting cases are the only ones for which the top hat formulation is exact .",
    "the case of an arbitrary dark energy sound speed @xmath1 is strictly not amenable to this simple treatment , since the existence of a finite sound speed and therefore the provision for the propagation of sound waves imply that the energy densities  both dark matter and dark energy  inside the overdense region must evolve to a nonuniform configuration , even if they are initially uniform .",
    "having said this , however , we must also bear in mind that the spherical collapse model is itself a simplified model of structure formation , and the top hat density contrast should be interpreted as the average density contrast inside a region after a unit top hat filtering function has been applied .",
    "if we take this as our guiding principle , then the generalisation of the spherical top hat to include a dark energy component with an arbitrary sound speed simply requires that we interpret @xmath34 as the spatially averaged density contrast of the dark energy field inside a region of comoving radius @xmath19 .",
    "symbolically , this spatial average can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denotes the comoving coordinates .",
    "it remains to specify an evolution equation for the dark energy density perturbation @xmath38 .",
    "we begin by writing down the continuity and euler equations for a relativistic fluid @xmath39 in an expanding background in the pseudo - newtonian approach  @xcite , @xmath40 = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\dot { \\bm u}}_\\alpha + { \\cal h } { \\bm u}_\\alpha +   ( { \\bm u}_\\alpha \\cdot \\nabla ) { \\bm u}_\\alpha + \\frac{\\nabla p_\\alpha+{\\bm u}_\\alpha { \\dot p}_\\alpha}{\\rho_\\alpha+p_\\alpha } + \\nabla \\phi_n=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the peculiar velocity of the fluid , and the potential @xmath43 can be obtained from the poisson equation @xmath44 these equations should apply if we restrict our considerations to ( i ) length scales much smaller than the hubble length , ( ii ) nonrelativistic peculiar velocities , and ( iii ) nonrelativistic sound speeds @xmath45 .",
    "we demonstrate in [ sec : rel ] that , at the linear level , these equations are indeed consistent with the newtonian limit of a general relativistic formulation ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    defining the equation of state parameter for the dark energy component @xmath46 and using the definitions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , equation  ( [ eq : eom ] )",

    "the continuity and euler equations  ( [ eq : deltaqfourier ] ) are nonlinear in the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which even under the assumption of spherical symmetry are nontrivial to solve . therefore , as a first approximation , we linearise them to obtain @xmath57 where we have defined the divergence of the dark energy velocity field to be @xmath58 , and assumed @xmath0 to be constant in time .",
    "linearisation assumes that the perturbed quantities @xmath55 and @xmath59 are small .",
    "this is likely a good assumption since ( i ) the presence of a finite sound speed @xmath1 naturally hinders the clustering of dark energy , keeping @xmath60 small relative to @xmath61 , and ( ii ) even in the limit @xmath62 where the clustering of dark energy is most efficient , a fully linear analysis shows that @xmath63 is suppressed relative to @xmath64 because of the dark energy s negative equation of state parameter ( see section  [ sec : linear ] ) .",
    "either way , the assumption of linearity in dark energy clustering can be easily checked _ a posteriori _ against solutions of the evolution equations for consistency .",
    "finally , let us stress again that we are linearising _ only _ the dark energy equations of motion ; the evolution of the dark matter component is still fully nonlinear , and described by the spherical collapse detailed in the previous section .",
    "we shall call this the `` quasi - nonlinear '' approach .    upon linearisation ,",
    "it is useful to recast the equations of motion in fourier space .",
    "define the fourier transform for some field @xmath65 as @xmath66 then , using the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson2 ] ) and the relation @xmath67",

    "lastly , we would like to relate @xmath73 to the average dark energy density contrast inside the top hat , @xmath74 , as defined in equation  ( [ eq : detophat ] ) , since this is the quantity that ultimately governs the evolution of the top hat radius @xmath19 via equation  ( [ eq : xdotdot ] ) .",
    "this step is simple : we only need to identify @xmath75 with @xmath76 , the latter of which is obtained by fourier transforming @xmath73 .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : detophat ] ) simplifies to @xmath77 our set of equations of motion is now complete .",
    "before we present the results of the spherical collapse model , let us first consider the evolution of dark matter and dark energy perturbations in the linear regime , i.e. , where the dark matter perturbations are also tracked with linearised equations of motion .",
    "this exercise is useful for two reasons .",
    "firstly , as we shall see , an understanding of the linear evolution can shed light on many essential features of the dependence of dark energy clustering on its equation of state parameter @xmath0 and sound speed @xmath1 . at the same time",
    ", the linear solution also sets the initial conditions for the spherical collapse model .",
    "secondly , some semi - analytic theories of structure formation such as the press  schechter formalism  @xcite and the excursion set theory  @xcite require as an input a linear critical density contrast @xmath78 . in these theories a collapsed structure",
    "is assumed to have formed once the linearly evolved matter density contrast reaches the threshold value @xmath79 at some time @xmath80 .",

    ", this means that in order to extract @xmath79 for a particular cosmological model , we need to solve _ both _ the nonlinear and the linear equations of motion at the same time .",
    "we have already written down the linearised equations of motion for the dark energy perturbations in equations  ( [ eq : linearq ] ) and ( [ eq : linearfourier ] ) .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) describes a damped harmonic oscillator with a driving force sourced by perturbations in the dark matter fluid .",
    "exact analytic solutions do not exist for arbitrary cosmologies .",

    "it is therefore necessary to specify the exact time dependence of @xmath92 , @xmath97 as well as @xmath98 in order to find a solution . formally setting @xmath99 ,",
    "the solution is particularly simple during the matter domination epoch , where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . at @xmath105",

    ", the solution of  @xcite depends explicitly on the sound speed @xmath25 , whereas our solution does not .",
    "part of the discrepancy can be traced to the term @xmath110 defined in equation  ( [ eq : dkx ] ) . in our analysis",
    "we always approximate this term as @xmath111 , while some contributions proportional to @xmath112 have been retained in the analysis of  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the derivation of  ( [ eq : nonclustering ] ) does not in fact require the assumption of a linear @xmath119 , since @xmath119 enters into the differential equation  ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) only through the gravitational potential @xmath120 , and hence the poisson equation , which is in any case linear in @xmath119 .",

    "we shall make use of this solution again later on in the analysis .",

    "since the dominant fourier mode is that corresponding to the comoving top hat radius @xmath19 which is itself associated with the halo mass @xmath5 , a reasonable generalisation of the non - clustering solution  ( [ eq : nonclustering ] ) for the dark energy component in terms of the halo mass would be @xmath194 the expression clearly shows that for a given sound speed , the absolute value of the dark energy density contrast increases with halo mass @xmath5 .",

    "this suggests that our approximation scheme for the dark energy evolution is approaching its limits of validity ; the approximation breaks down for larger masses .",
    "thus the rule of thumb regarding the quasi - nonlinear approach appears to be that it can be safely used for halo masses up to roughly the jeans mass @xmath2 , but not beyond . and @xmath181 .",
    "in general , however , we expect the validity of the quasi - nonlinear approximation scheme to be dependent also on the choice of @xmath0 , where the less @xmath0 deviates from @xmath177 , the higher the halo mass for which the approximation scheme remains applicable . ]",
    "next , we compute the linear critical density contrast @xmath78 required for use with such semi - analytic theories as the press  schechter formalism and the excursion set theory .",
    "this can be achieved by solving simultaneously _ both _ the nonlinear and the linear equations of motion for the spherical collapse , and formally identifying @xmath79 as the linearly evolved matter density contrast at the instant the top hat radius vanishes .",

    "the @xmath5-dependence is however quite weak for those cases with @xmath0 close to @xmath177 , since dark energy clustering is generally suppressed by a factor @xmath122 .",

    "the later the collapse , the larger the difference between the values of @xmath213 for the clustering and the non - clustering solutions .",
    "the reason is simply that the contribution of dark energy to the total energy budget in the universe increases with time .",
    "this means the effect of dark energy clustering also becomes more important at lower redshifts .    finally , we caution the reader again that our quasi - nonlinear approximation breaks down if the dark energy density contrast inside the top hat becomes too large , especially when the halo mass approaches or exceeds the jeans mass associated with a chosen sound speed . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "we take the condition of breakdown to be @xmath214 at any time during the collapse process . to alert the reader to those cases where the breakdown condition is met ,",
    "we indicate the resulting linear threshold densities @xmath79 in figure  [ fig : delta ] with dotted lines ; in these cases , the exact values of @xmath81 are unreliable . clearly , for equation of state parameters that deviate significantly from @xmath215 ( e.g. , @xmath216 ) , our approximate approach breaks down already at @xmath217 . for @xmath218 ,",
    "the approach appears to remain valid for a larger mass range .",
    "the breakdown of our approximation in the clustering limit also explains why we do not recover the exact results of reference  @xcite for @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "in fact , in the clustering limit , our approximation appears to overestimate the effect of dark energy clustering on the linear threshold density ; had we included all nonlinear effects , nonlinear dark energy clustering would feed back on the matter clustering more effectively , thereby leading to an earlier collapse for @xmath201 ( and a later collapse for @xmath202 ) .",
    "an earlier collapse means that the linearly evolved matter density contrast would reach a lower value at the time of collapse , so that the real @xmath221 in the clustering limit would be lower than our estimate in figure  [ fig : delta ] .      in reality",
    "the collapse of an overdense region will never take place in the way described above , since density fluctuations inside the region will moderate the infall , and the system reaches virial equilibrium before the matter density can ever become infinite . for a single component system such as the case of a dark matter - dominated eds universe",
    ", the process of virialisation and the radius at which virial equilibrium is attained can be obtained directly from the spherical collapse physics by assuming energy conservation between the time of turnaround  defined as the moment at which the top hat radius begins to shrink  and the time at which virial equilibrium is established .",
    "the result turns out to be rather simple , @xmath222 i.e. , virialisation is complete by the time the top hat radius decreases to half its value at turnaround .    for more complicated systems , such as the two fluid system considered in this paper , the conditions of energy conservation need to be modified .",
    "the time of virialisation can still be taken to be the instant at which the virial theorem is satisfied . however , the problem is complicated by the fact that we do not know how or if the dark energy fluid takes part in the virialisation process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , for simplicity",
    ", we adopt equation  ( [ eq : radvir ] ) as the virialisation condition for this paper , and define the virial overdensity as @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the time at which @xmath225 .",

    "similar to the linear threshold density @xmath81 , @xmath230 is first and foremost dependent on the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "introducing a finite dark energy sound speed into the picture induces for @xmath230 a dependence on the halo mass @xmath5 .",

    "the results in figure  [ fig : virial ] are for a collapse redshift of @xmath197 . for halos that collapse earlier",
    ", the dependence of @xmath230 on the halo mass is qualitatively similar to the @xmath197 case , but the difference in @xmath230 between the clustering and the non - clustering limits is smaller .",
    "this trend is reminiscent of the results in figure  [ fig : delta ] for the linear threshold density @xmath235 for different collapse redshifts .",
    "finally , note that some authors define the virial overdensity as the top hat density at the time of virialisation @xmath224 , but normalised to the background density evaluated at the _ collapse time _ @xmath80 .",
    "this means that instead of , e.g. , @xmath232 for the eds model according to our definition  ( [ eq : virdensity ] ) , one finds a higher value of @xmath236 simply because between @xmath224 and @xmath80 the background density has become smaller due to the hubble expansion .",
    "since the dark energy sound speed does not play a role in the background expansion , the effect of these differing definitions is only to induce a shift in the normalisation of @xmath230 for a given set of @xmath0 and @xmath175 .",
    "the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath230 is unaffected .",
    "while a dark energy fluid with a negative equation of state parameter appears to describe the apparent accelerated expansion of our universe with reasonable success , the precise nature and properties of this dark energy remain undetermined . in this paper , we have addressed some aspects of the dark energy s role in cosmic structure formation .",
    "specifically , we have considered a generic dark energy fluid parameterised by a constant equation of state parameter @xmath0 and sound speed @xmath1 , and determined their impact on the formation of gravitationally bound objects .",
    "our main tool is the spherical collapse model , incorporating a nonrelativistic dark matter component and a generic dark energy fluid described above .",
    "such a model has been investigated by other authors previously in the limit where the dark energy is ( i ) non - clustering , i.e. , @xmath237 , or ( ii ) comoving with the dark matter , i.e. , @xmath238 . in this work",
    ", we have generalised the spherical collapse model to describe those intermediate cases characterised by an arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "although we have focussed on scenarios with constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 , our approach is equally applicable to dark energy fluids described by time - dependent parameters . along the way",
    ", we have also provided a detailed description of dark energy evolution in the linear regime ",
    "again for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and identified some salient features of dark energy clustering .",
    "the dark energy component changes the evolution of the spherical collapse through its effect on the overall expansion of the universe as well as through its own clustering abilities . in the non - clustering limit ,",
    "only the equation of state parameter @xmath0 plays a role in the dynamics of the spherical collapse by altering the rate of the hubble expansion . when the dark energy is able to cluster , however , then the dark energy density contrast also sources the evolution of the dark matter density perturbations .",
    "the amount of dark energy clustering is determined by both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , since the introduction of a dark energy sound speed @xmath1 necessarily brings into the picture a `` jeans scale '' and hence a `` jeans mass '' @xmath2 , we find that the same sound speed can influence the spherical collapse dynamics in different ways depending on the mass of the collapsed object or the `` halo mass '' @xmath5 .",
    "this mass dependence is especially manifest when we compute the virial overdensity @xmath230 and the linearly extrapolated threshold density @xmath213 . in both cases ,",
    "we find two asymptotic regions corresponding to the non - clustering @xmath239 limit and the clustering @xmath3 limit , where the value of @xmath230 or @xmath213 is practically constant with respect to @xmath5 . in between these limits is a transition region , in which @xmath230 ( @xmath221 ) declines ( grows ) strongly with @xmath5 .",
    "observing this transition region will be tell - tale sign that dark energy is dynamic , and a great leap towards pinning down its clustering properties .",
    "one possible way to discern this halo mass - dependent dark energy clustering is to measure the cluster mass function .",
    "already it has been shown in , e.g. , reference  @xcite that the difference between a clustering ( @xmath62 ) and a homogeneous ( @xmath237 ) dark energy fluid can be an order unity effect on the expected number of clusters at the high mass tail of the mass function .",
    "it remains to be seen how exactly an arbitrary dark energy sound speed would alter this conclusion , but some additional scale - dependent effects are almost guaranteed to be present .",
    "finally , let us remind the reader again that in our spherical collapse analysis we have simplified the equations of motion for the dark energy component so that only terms linear in the dark energy density contrast have been retained .",
    "this approach is strictly not valid for those cases in which the dark energy density contrast exceeds unity during the collapse process , and is especially prone to breakdown for cosmologies with an equation of state parameter that deviates significantly from @xmath215 . in these cases ,",
    "a fully nonlinear analysis is required in order to compute accurately such quantities as @xmath230 and @xmath213 for comparison with observations .",
    "however , the qualitative features of dark energy clustering should not be affected by our simplified approach .",
    "a fully nonlinear analysis would require that we solve the equations of motion for the dark energy component  two @xmath240-dimensional partial differential equations  using either a grid - based finite difference scheme or a lagrangian method akin to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation .",

    "<S> the dark energy component is effectively homogeneous , and its role in the formation of these structures is reduced to its effects on the hubble expansion rate . to compute quantitatively the virial density and the linearly extrapolated threshold density </S>",
