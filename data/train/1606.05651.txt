    "while central to our understanding of the formation of the galaxy , the birthplaces of the stars that make up its main components are not well known . in the case of the galactic halo ,",
    "this classical problem @xcite has been framed in modern times within the context of galaxy formation theory @xcite in a @xmath1-cdm universe @xcite .",
    "recent evidence that the galactic halo is split into an inner and an outer component , with distinct chemical compositions @xcite goes along with theoretical predictions for the origin of those components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at least in a qualitative sense ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an alternative view ) .",
    "most importantly , both data and models have reached a degree of sophistication that allows one to begin addressing detailed questions about the nature of the original star forming units that gestated the stars seen in the halo today  in particular their characteristic masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    regarding the bulge , the situation is considerably less clear , which is due partly to difficult observational access to the inner galaxy , and partly to the short dynamical timescales , which caused signatures of the early stellar systems to be erased from phase space long ago .",
    "moreover , the physical overlap of all components of the galaxy ( halo , thin and thick disks , bar , and bulge ) within its inner few kpc makes a definition of the pertinence of a given star or stellar group to any of those components quite difficult , making the very definition of the bulge itself somewhat contentious .",
    "the literature on the galactic bulge is sufficiently vast to render any attempt at a summary here quite vain .",
    "however , the picture emerging from even a brief examination of the state of the art is that of a current lack of a unique definition of the nature of the bulge , both in terms of the distribution of its components in phase space and , to a lesser extent , in terms of its stellar population content .",
    "we therefore use the term `` bulge '' somewhat loosely , without necessarily implying the existence of a classical spheroidal structure detached from the inner halo , but simply referring to the aggregate of all stellar mass cohabiting the central few kpc of the galaxy .",
    "studies of stellar bulge spatial distribution , kinematics , metallicity distribution function , metallicity gradients , and abundance patterns paint a complex picture .",
    "several groups have confirmed the presence of a complex metallicity distribution of bulge stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the presence of multiple components , each with characteristic structure and kinematics . at high metallicity ( [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath2  0.5 ) , the bulge appears to be dominated by a boxy / peanut - shaped structure , associated with a bar @xcite , which in projection has been found to assume an x shape in 2mass maps @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , stars in the low - metallicity end take on a more spheroidal distribution and are thought to be associated with either the thick disk or halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or perhaps even a classical spheroidal bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the existence of the latter has been called into question by model fits to stellar counts in the 2mass and sdss catalogs @xcite .",
    "evidence from kinematics pointing to the existence of an anti - correlation between metallicity and velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) jibes well with the above picture .",
    "more detailed studies , based on high quality radial velocities for samples of many thousand stars show that , while the metal - rich bulge population rotates cylindrically , the kinematics of metal - poor stars is consistent with a slowly rotating spheroid , possibly due to a combination of thick disk and halo @xcite .",
    "finally , detailed chemical abundance studies showed , since the early work by @xcite , that metal - poor stars tend to be @xmath3-enhanced , as in the thick disk and halo , whereas their metal - rich counterparts have [ @xmath3/fe ] close to solar ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when studied individually , @xmath3 elements were found not to follow all exactly the same trend with metallicity @xcite and , perhaps most importantly , to be slightly more enhanced in metal - rich bulge stars than in their thin and thick disk counterparts @xcite .",
    "one possible approach to gain insights into the nature of star forming units that gave origin to the stars in the galaxy is through chemical tagging @xcite .",
    "the method consists of using very detailed and accurate chemical compositions to identify stars sharing a common origin , with the hope of tracing them back to their original star forming units . in principle ,",
    "chemical tagging can be extremely powerful , provided that each and every star forming unit was characterised by a _",
    "unique _ detailed abundance pattern .",
    "if this assumption is correct , one could distinguish every single star forming unit from all others by determining a large enough number of elemental abundances . that , of course , is observationally very costly .",
    "a weaker , less expensive , form of the method consists of associating a given abundance pattern not necessarily to a unique star forming unit , but to an entire class  say , stellar clusters above a given mass .",
    "in order to work , this _ weak chemical tagging _ requires knowledge of a smaller number of elemental abundances than does standard strong chemical tagging .",
    "an early application of weak chemical tagging was pursued by @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these authors discovered halo field stars with very high nitrogen and relatively low carbon abundances , which is an abundance pattern characteristic of some particular globular cluster ( gc ) populations . on the theory that these stars were originally formed in gcs , martell and collaborators concluded that they resulted from the dissolution of gcs a claim that is in line with detections of tidal tails around gcs such as palomar 5 @xcite and ngc 5466 @xcite . by accounting for the expected fraction of gc stars with normal n abundances , @xcite estimated that at least 17% of the stellar mass in the galactic halo resulted from the dissolution of gcs and/or their parent systems .",
    "based on the same results , but adopting a different set of assumptions , @xcite estimated that _ most _ of the halo has in fact originated from those systems . following yet another approach based on a model of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galactic gc system , @xcite estimate that up to 1020% of the galactic halo mass was contributed by tidal evaporation of galactic gcs .",
    "one major difference in these estimates is that they assign different theoretically motivated ratios between the numbers of `` enriched '' and `` normal '' stars .",
    "our lack of a firm handle on the origin of the multiple - population phenomenon in galactic gcs is therefore an important limiting factor .",
    "moreover , uncertainties about the shape of the initial mass function of the galactic gc system also play a role .",
    "the presence of large spreads of elemental abundances , and anti - correlations thereof , in gc stars has been long known ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consistently confirmed by more recent observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the past decade , abundance spreads were ascribed to the clusters intrinsic chemical evolution , either due to some form of feedback - regulated star formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or to other processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , none of the existing models put forth so far can account for the existing chemical composition data in detail @xcite .",
    "yet , the different models make vastly different predictions . in particular , models that propose chemical evolution through feedback - regulated star formation postulate that gcs were 10 - 100 times more massive in the past ( for discussion and references , see , e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover ,",
    "according to these models , the vast majority of this mass must have been in the form of _ first generation _ stars ( henceforth , fg stars ) which so far remain chemically indistinguishable from field stars of the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "these conditions are required so that , for any reasonable initial mass function , early stellar generations can produce the necessary amounts of light elements observed in _",
    "second generation stars _",
    "( sg stars)those with enhanced he ,",
    "n , na , and al abundances .",
    "this issue is referred to as the _ mass budget problem _ @xcite .    in this paper , we report the serendipitous discovery of a population of bulge field stars with abundance patterns that are similar to those found in stars from globular clusters",
    ". characterised by high [ n / fe ] , which is correlated with [ al / fe ] and anti - correlated with [ c / fe ] , these stars are homogeneously distributed across the galactic bulge and , to first order , are spatially and kinematically indistinguishable from the rest of the bulge field population .",
    "we characterise this new population and discuss the implications of this finding for our understanding of both bulge and gc formation .    in section  [ data ]",

    "further in - depth information on the apogee survey , data , and the data reduction pipeline can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ) is described in detail in @xcite .",

    "possible systematic effects in our distances were assessed by employing the linear distance estimator from @xcite , with the conclusion that distances to the giants may be too long by about 25% in general , with indications for possibly a larger systematic effect at @xmath5 , which does not affect our results .    in this paper , we concern ourselves with a subset of the apogee sample , namely stars located in the galactic bulge . moreover , because we are interested in searching for stars with chemical signatures typical of gc members , we focus on the abundances of fe , c , n , and al . with the above constraints in mind , the sample analysed in this study is defined by the following set of criteria :    1 .",

    "were identified and excluded from the sample .",
    "a star was considered to be a gc member if it is located within its tidal radius , if its radial velocity differs from that of the gc ( when available ) by no more than 20 @xmath14 , and if its metallicity differs from that of the cluster by no more than 0.3 dex . in this way",
    "8 stars were identified as gc members , within the range of distances above , leaving us with a grand total of 5,140 field stars .",
    "the surface gravity criterion is meant to avoid contamination of the sample by nearby dwarfs  which are in any case extremely rare in apogee bulge pointings , given the shallower magnitude limit adopted in these fields  see @xcite for details .",
    "the @xmath10 criterion is aimed at maximizing the overall quality of the abundances considered . at @xmath15  k , apogee does not presently provide elemental abundances , because the spectral library upon which aspcap is based does not extend to such low temperatures . at the other end of the @xmath10 range ,",
    "stars hotter than 4500  k are not considered because the abundances of c and n are uncertain in that @xmath10 regime ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty arises because aspcap determines these abundances from the strengths of cn and co lines , which become too weak for @xmath16  k at relatively low metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath171 ) .",

    "the latter data set is used to define the locus occupied by gc stars in chemical diagnostic plots .",

    "giant stars with @xmath20 and low surface gravity present extended atmospheres , which can invalidate the plane - parallel approximation .",

    "these comparisons showed that the elemental abundances relevant to this work are not affected by adoption of those more sophisticated analysis methods , so we proceed by adopting dr12 numbers for the remainder of this study .",
    "a cautionary note is in order before proceeding with the analysis .",
    "the elemental abundances from apogee are subject to zero - point differences relative to optical studies .",
    "calibrations between the apogee and literature abundance scales were performed by @xcite on dr10 data @xcite , whereas , for dr12 , a similar procedure was followed , as described by @xcite . in this study , unless otherwise noted , we opt to work with the uncorrected data , to take full advantage of the homogeneity and internal consistency of the aspcap - derived elemental abundances , which is crucial when comparing samples from different systems , such as the galactic bulge and gcs .",

    "in this section we describe the central finding reported in this paper , namely , the discovery of stars in the field of the inner galaxy that possess chemical compositions that are suggestive of a globular cluster origin . in sections 3.1 and 3.2",
    "the behaviour of the sample in chemical composition diagnostic plots is characterised , and the identification of the newly discovered stellar population is described .",
    "section 3.3 is aimed at reassuring the reader of the reality of the high nitrogen abundances resulting from aspcap .",
    "sections 3.4 and 3.5 discuss the possible contamination of our sample by other stars that could potentially present the same abundance patterns , respectively intermediate - mass agb stars and the secondary remnants of mass - transfer binaries , concluding that such contaminations are minimal and not likely to affect our results importantly .",

    "the surface abundances of these elements are affected by the combined effects of the first dredge - up and extra mixing ( for a thorough review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the first dredge - up is a well understood physical process that involves the deepening of the convection zone as the star evolves up the giant branch , causing material processed through the cn(o ) cycle to be brought to the stellar surface , changing the atmospheric abundances of some elements .",
    "extra mixing , on the other hand , is a nonconvective process that brings about additional changes to atmospheric abundances in red giants ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the efficiency of extra mixing is a function of stellar metallicity @xcite , and the physical process responsible for it has not been established yet .",

    "a diagnostic plot that can shed light on the nature of those stars is shown in figure  [ nc_bulge]a where n - rich stars are again highlighted by large symbols .",
    "one can see that the n - rich stars are distributed along at least two discrete bands where [ n / fe ] is anti - correlated with [ c / fe ] .",

    "as mentioned above , the mixing of the products of high - temperature shell hydrogen burning into the atmospheres of the giant branch stars leads to a large increase in the relative abundance of nitrogen along the giant branch , at the expense of a comparable , ( or smaller , depending on the cluster or data set ) , decrease in the relative abundance of carbon . over time",
    ", rgb stars evolve along these branches , upward and to the left through the [ c / fe]-[n / fe ] plane .",
    "the similarity with gc stars is further suggested by figure  [ nc_bulge]b , where apogee data for stars belonging to a few galactic gcs , spanning the same range of metallicities as the n - rich stars , are overlaid on the field sample .",

    "each of these sequences corresponds to one of the multiple populations commonly found in galactic globular clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the apogee data on these clusters ) .",
    "since the stars in both field and gc samples are red giants that have undergone first dredge - up , their nitrogen abundances have increased from their initial main - sequence values at the expense of @xmath27c .",

    "the stars belonging to the `` normal '' sequence reach [ n / fe ] as high as @xmath0 + 0.5 and [ c / fe ] around @xmath29 , which may be extreme values for first dredge - up in low - mass red giants , but can be accounted for by efficient deep mixing during the first - ascent giant branch . taking the example of a star with [ fe / h]=@xmath30 and the observed trend in figure  [ nfe_bulge ] , the expected initial @xmath31n abundance would be [ n / fe ]  @xmath32 , or a(n)@xmath06.8 for a solar nitrogen value of a@xmath33=7.86 . at the same [ fe / h ] , normal stars in our sample have an average value of @xmath28 for [ c / fe ] , which corresponds to a(c)@xmath07.25 . if most of this initial carbon ( @xmath27c ) is converted to @xmath31n via the cn - cycle , then the red giant nitrogen abundance could approach @xmath34 , or [ n / fe ] around + 0.5 or + 0.6 .",

    "the above simple cn - cycle mixing scenario can not account for the more extreme abundances in our sample .",
    "most models proposed to account for the existence of such stars in gcs contend that they result from chemical evolution within the globular clusters themselves , as discussed in section  [ intro ] . in apparent support to that scenario , figure  [ nc_bulge]b indicates that the gc sequences at high [ n / fe ] tend to have , on average , lower [ c / fe ] than those at normal [ n / fe ] , which is a manifestation of the well - documented fact that sg stars are both enhanced in n and diminished in c relative to fgs .",
    "yet , the sample of high [ n / fe ] outliers in figure  [ nfe_bulge ] contains stars with [ c / fe ] as high as @xmath0 + 0.3 . because such stars are not typically found in gcs , and because we want to avoid contamination by objects such as ch stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , the minimum [ n / fe ] for gc stars matches approximately the values for the field population at same [ fe / h ] .",
    "in other words , the [ n / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] relation of the field population lies along the lower envelope of the [ n / fe ] distribution in the gc samples .",
    "this result is consistent with findings by other studies , which have characterised fg stars in gcs as having the same chemistry as field stars of same metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the scatter of the field population in [ n / fe ] is similar to that of the gc populations with lowest [ n / fe ] ( fg stars ) , suggesting that the _ thickness _ of the stellar sequences at constant [ fe / h ] is due to deep mixing , at least in the low metallicity regime .",
    "the similarity between n - rich stars and sg stars from gcs can be further tested through examination of other abundance ( anti-)correlations typically found in gcs .",
    "the most popular is the anti - correlation between the abundances of na and o , but unfortunately sodium abundances in dr12 rely on a nai line at @xmath35  1639.333  nm that is too weak in the spectra of stars with the typical @xmath10 and metallicity of the n - rich sample for reliable abundances to be derived by aspcap .",
    "examination of spectral fits for a handful of cool stars in the metal - rich end of our sample suggests the sodium abundances to be very high in n - rich stars and correspondingly lower in n - normal stars .",

    "it is possible that some of the stars below the variability detection threshold of this comparison are small amplitude red giant variables , such as those identified in the ogle survey @xcite .",

    "in fact , the standard deviation of the n - rich sample is slightly smaller in the n - rich sample ( @xmath58 ) than in the rest of the sample ( @xmath59 ) , which taken at face value suggests that the incidence of variable stars in the n - rich sample is , if anything , smaller than in the rest of the sample .",
    "in conclusion , analysis of two - epoch observations in both the optical and nir consistently indicate that the fraction of variable stars in our sample is of the order of @xmath010% .",
    "however , interestingly , the bottom panel of figure  [ deltamags ] shows that there is no correlation between magnitude variations in the usno and 2mass / denis catalogs , particularly in the n - rich sample .",
    "it is noteworthy that the stars for which variation is largest in one band , in the other band fall within the area of the graph consistent with no variation . in other words , they are confined to the cross - shaped locus defined by the @xmath60 limits in both bands . in other words , stars that look variable in nir do not in optical , and vice versa",
    ". this may be partly due to the fact that observations were collected at different epochs , but in this case one would expect that at least _ some _ of the largest deviants would fall outside the cross - shaped locus . of relevance to this discussion is the fact that magnitude errors for the most deviant points in the usno - b sample are particularly large , even though they do not entirely account for the discrepancies .",
    "all in all , the bottom panel of figure  [ deltamags ] suggests that the fraction of variables in the n - rich sample may be indeed smaller than suggested by usno and 2mass - denis data considered in isolation .",
    "we conclude that there is little evidence for a large contribution of agb stars to our sample . considering uncertainties in photometry and in the locus occupied by the various stellar types in the 2mass and irac cmds and colour - colour plots ,",
    "it seems safe to conclude that our sample stars are predominantly composed of first - ascent rgb stars , with at most a small contribution by agb stars .",
    "it is difficult to provide a solid estimate of the ratio between the number of agb and rgb stars in our sample , without a more detailed analysis of the agb candidates .",
    "examination of the data presented in this section suggests that the ratio is probably no larger than @xmath0 5 - 10% , being thus consistent with data from other old metal - poor stellar populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a discussion )",

    "the donor star evolves away from the agb phase and eventually becomes a faint white dwarf , while the companion retains their chemical signature .",
    "establishing the presence of radial velocity variations among the n - rich stars would be the most natural course of action towards estimating the fraction of such objects formed through the binary channel .",
    "however , most of the objects in our sample were observed just once and those with multiple observations have a relatively short ( @xmath61 6 months ) baseline , which makes possible detection of only a small fraction of such binaries .",
    "observations of ch stars , which are objects of similar nature ( see below for details ) , are typically of the order of several years ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to determine the expected number of mass - transfer binaries in a given population from first principles one needs to know a number of properties of the underlying stellar population , such as the initial mass function , the binary fraction as well as binary period , eccentricity , and mass ratio distributions .",

    "nevertheless , reasonable assumptions can be made for these quantities .",

    "alternatively , one can estimate the expected fraction of n - rich stars which result from transfer binaries in a more empirical way , by using the observed number of ch stars in the whole sample .",

    ". however , [ c / fe ] varies slightly with metallicity within the sample , so that a sample of ch - star candidates defined on the basis of a constant lower limit would be biased towards stars with higher metallicity .",
    "therefore , ch - star candidates are selected in a manner analogous to how the n - rich sample itself was defined , by fitting a high order polynomial to the run of [ c / fe ] with [ fe / h ] and taking stars deviating from the fit by @xmath65 .",

    "eliminating these 23 stars from the sample and recalling that the expected ratio of n - rich to ch stars resulting from binaries is 0.5 , our estimate of the number of n - rich stars owing their atmospheric composition to binary mass transfer would be @xmath0 15 , or approximately a quarter of the sample identified in previous sections .",
    "we emphasise that this number is an upper limit , based on adopting a wide mass range for the production of al in intermediate - mass stars and a low cutoff for considering a star c - rich .",
    "in fact , we argue that the real number must be smaller , for the following reasons . first and foremost , one would expect to find a population of n - rich stars in the galactic disk if the phenomenon had an important contribution from mass transfer binaries .",

    "following the same reasoning as above , one would expect to find  25 n - rich stars in the disk field , and instead not a single one is found .",
    "in fact , the few n - rich stars identified within the thusly defined disk belong to the low latitude globular clusters m 71 and ngc 6760 .",
    "one might argue that , because the disk has a higher overall metallicity than the n - rich sample , the production of n - rich stars is inhibited , because models suggest that intermediate - mass agb stars produce less nitrogen at higher metallicity @xcite .",

    "we summarise the content of sections  [ agbs ] and [ binaries ] by concluding that there is no evidence for a high incidence of either agb stars or mass - transfer binaries in our sample , so that the abundance pattern observed in most of the sample can not be explained by those phenomena .",

    ", we simply state that the global bulge mdf is in good agreement with those by @xcite and @xcite , which are based on gaia - eso and argos data , respectively . in particular , stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 1 make up 5.8 and 4.6% of the samples by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , whereas they make up 228 out of our sample of 5,140 stars , or 4.4 @xmath69 0.4% , which is in formal agreement with the @xcite mdf .    to err on the side of caution , we checked for the presence of a bias against metal - poor giants that could have been introduced by the @xmath70 limit in our sample .",
    "we found that extending the sample by including giants as warm as @xmath71 added 18 stars to the sample , increasing only marginally the percentage of stars with [ fe / h]@xmath91 , to 4.7 @xmath69 0.4% . examining in detail the @xmath10 distribution of the stars that are excluded by the @xmath72k cut , we find that all stars have @xmath73k .",
    "the absence of warmer stars is due to the relatively shallow ( h=11 ) apogee magnitude limit in bulge fields , which restricts the sample to cool evolved giants .",
    "regarding their metallicity distribution , the stars range between 2@xmath9[fe / h]@xmath9 + 0.0 , with a mean value of [ fe / h]=0.94 . on the metal - poor end ,",
    "16 stars have [ fe / h]@xmath91 to be contrasted with at sample of 220 stars in the same metallicity range and @xmath74k .",
    "most importantly , only at most 5/18 of those stars can be classified as n - rich following the definition provided in section  [ nrich ] . of those ,",
    "2 have [ fe / h]@xmath121 , 2 are within the 1.5@xmath9[fe / h]@xmath91 interval , and 1 has [ fe / h]@xmath91.5 . such a small sample of warm n - rich stars has obviously no impact on the mdf of the n - rich population .",
    "it is thus safe to conclude that our sample is free of any important metallicity bias on the metal - poor end . in closing",
    ", we note that the n - rich / n - normal ratio within this warm sub - sample is 5/18 , thus substantially higher than in the rest of the metal - poor sample .",
    "given the considerable uncertainties in [ n / fe ] at such low metallicity and relatively high @xmath10 , we ascribe little significance to this result , while deeming it worthy of a closer examination in the near future .",
    "the findings discussed in the previous section tantalizingly suggest that a population of stars with globular cluster origin has been identified in the inner galaxy . in line with early theoretical predictions (",
    "* see also gnedin et al .",
    "2014 ) , we hypothesise that these stars result from the destruction of pre - existing galactic globular clusters . interestingly , @xcite proposed that millisecond pulsars , resulting from the destruction of gcs , can account for gamma ray detections by the _",
    "satellite towards the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "this has important implications , as @xcite show that their model does a better job of matching the data than models invoking annihilating dark matter @xcite . assuming this hypothesis is correct",
    ", our discovery may also have interesting repercussions for the current understanding of the formation and evolution of the galactic globular cluster system , the presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters , and possibly also the formation of the bulge itself . in this section",
    "we discuss some of these ramifications .",
    "we conduct our discussion in sections  [ lowmet ] through [ nvsgcs ] within the framework of a gc origin for the newly found stellar population . in section  [ etgs ]",
    ", we speculate on a possible connection between n - rich stars and stellar populations inhabiting the cores of andromeda and early - type galaxies .",
    "finally , in section  [ origin ] we discuss the origin of the new stellar population , conjecturing also possible scenarios beyond a pure gc origin .",
    "we begin by exploring the observed mdf in order to place constraints on the ratio between the numbers of stars with n - normal and n - rich chemical compositions  the fg / sg ratio  in the parent population of n - rich stars .",
    "figure  [ mdfs ] shows that the mdf of n - rich stars ( middle panel ) differs quite substantially from that of the rest of the full sample ( top panel ) . while the bulge mdf extends towards very high metallicities , that of n - rich stars peaks around [ fe / h]=1 , with broad wings towards high and low metallicity .",
    "the apparent dip around [ fe / h ]  =  0.9 is strongly dependent on the binning adopted , so we assign no significance to it , given the small numbers per bin .    assuming that the mdf of n - rich stars reflects precisely that of the destroyed gcs",
    ", one can use the metal - poor tail of the mdfs to constrain the ratio of n - normal to n - rich stars , and in this way derive an upper limit on the mass lost by gcs .",
    "there are 15 n - rich stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath75 out of a sample of 214 stars in the field within the same metallicity interval and [ c / fe ]  @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "approximately 93% of the stars in our sample with [ fe / h ]  @xmath75 have normal n abundances . therefore ,",
    "if one was to accept that _ all _ bulge stars with those metallicities originate from the destruction of gcs  a rather extreme scenario  one would conclude that 93% of the stellar mass in those systems was originally in the form of fg stars .",
    "we emphasise that this is an _",
    "upper limit_. the mdf in the top panel of figure  [ mdfs ] shows that the inner galaxy is dominated by a metal - rich stellar population which most likely does not result from gc destruction , seeing as it lacks a counterpart in the n - rich mdf .",
    "it is only reasonable to assume that some of those field populations not associated with gc destruction are also present at [ fe / h]@xmath75 .",
    "thus , to have all bulge stars with [ fe / h]@xmath75 come from gc destruction is most likely an unachievable feat .",
    "consequently , the fraction of fg stars in those systems was most likely lower than 93% .",
    "if we were to assume , for instance , that as much as 1/2 of the mass in the volume sampled resulted from gc destruction , then we would conclude that fg / sg @xmath0 6 for the dissolved gcs . in subsequent sections",
    "we explore the impact of the acceptable range of fg / sg ratio values on estimates of the total stellar mass in destroyed gcs .",
    "this result rules out models requiring fg / sg @xmath77 to address the mass budget problem .    most importantly , this result poses a constraint on models that address the mass budget problem in gc formation by proposing that the fg / sg ratio was much larger in early gcs than observed today .",
    "recently , @xcite determined integrated - light metallicities of gcs in dwarf galaxies , and established that the ratio between the stellar mass in gcs and the field , at the same metallicity , in the stellar haloes studied was too high to accommodate the requirements from selective stellar mass - loss models .",
    "that essentially the same conclusion has been reached from studies of samples in very different environments and metallicity ranges suggests that this may well be a general result .      under the hypothesis that the n - rich stars result from dissolution of galactic gcs , it is interesting to use their observed numbers to estimate the total stellar mass contained in dissolved gcs , to assess its contribution to the total stellar mass of the inner galaxy and also to compare it with the mass contained in surviving gcs .",
    "however , only one type of gc star can be uniquely discriminated on the basis of the data under consideration  those belonging to the sg group .",
    "an estimate of the total stellar mass allocated in the form of these dissolved clusters obviously requires knowledge of the contribution by fg stars , which can not be distinguished from field populations of the same metallicity , at least not on the basis of apogee data alone . in the absence of any constraints on the fg / sg ratio , we make assumptions for two limiting cases that hopefully bracket the entire range of possibilities .",
    "the _ minimal scenario _ , assumes that there is no mass budget problem .",
    "in other words , the fg / sg ratio is exactly as observed today  about 1/2 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the _ maximal scenario _",
    ", fg stars completely overwhelm n - rich stars .",
    "according to that scenario , early gcs were 10 - 100 times more massive in the past @xcite , with essentially all the mass lost having been in the form of fgs .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ lowmet ] , the fg / sg ratio can not have been higher than @xmath0 9/1 without violating constraints from the low - metallicity end of the mdf discussed in the previous section .        to estimate the mass in dissolved gcs",
    ", we first estimate the fraction of the total stellar mass in the inner galaxy contributed by n - rich stars , and following that we determine the contribution by dissolved gcs assuming fg / sg = 1/2 . the total number of n - rich stars , selected as described in section  [ distrib ] , is 58 out of a total sample of 5,140 stars .",
    "to first order , the ratio of n - rich to n - normal stars is not biased in any important way by apogee s target selection criteria ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , or by the definition of our sample , including its range of stellar parameters ( section  [ data ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can safely state that n - rich stars amount to about 1.1% of the total population in the inner galaxy .",
    "assuming fg / sg = 1/2 , we conclude that the contribution of dissolved gcs to the stellar mass content of the inner galaxy is small , at the 1.7% level . by",
    "further assuming a ( unlikely ) scenario where the contribution of mass - transfer binaries to the n - rich sample is at its maximum 25% level , we would be led to conclude that the lower limit for the fractional contribution of dissolved gcs to the mass of the bulge is 1.3% .",
    "the total mass of the galactic bulge is estimated to be @xmath78 @xcite , with a stellar mass ranging somewhere between 1.25 and 1.6@xmath79 @xcite . in the minimal scenario , the total mass in stars resulting from gc destruction",
    "would then range between 1.6 and @xmath80 , which is in relatively good agreement with model predictions for the contribution of disrupted gcs to the stellar mass contained within the inner few kpc of the galaxy ( 10@xmath8110@xmath82  m@xmath83 , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that a similar mass in dissolved gcs can explain the gamma ray detections by the _",
    "satellite within 10@xmath84 of the galactic centre .",
    "an alternative mass estimate can be obtained from consideration of a detailed model for the inner galaxy , such as the one by @xcite , which matches stellar counts in the 2mass and sdss catalogs .",
    "according to @xcite a cylinder of 2  kpc radius and 4  kpc height centred on the galactic centre , contains a total @xmath85 .",
    "there are a total of 3,244 apogee stars within the same volume , 45 of which belong to the n - rich population .",
    "folding in factors accounting for the fg / sg ratio and maximum mass - transfer binary contribution , we conclude that the total mass of disrupted gcs would be @xmath86 , which is within the range of estimates provided above .",
    "significantly , the mass contained in dissolved gcs is a factor of @xmath0 6 - 8 higher than the total mass in all _ existing _ galactic gcs ( @xmath87 , * ? ? ?",
    "this is obviously an important result . on the theory that n - rich stars are byproducts of gc destruction",
    ", we would conclude that the galactic gcs are remnants of a formerly much larger gc system  or of what would have become a much larger gc system today  that was largely destroyed through interaction with the environment .",
    "this result naturally prompts us to ask whether such a dramatic destruction rate is a common phenomenon in the universe , or whether the milky way is in some way special .",
    "@xcite reported that the ratio @xmath88 between the mass of the gc system and total galaxy mass ( including both dark and stellar matter ) is @xmath89 , and showed that it is constant over several orders of magnitude in galaxy mass and with a relatively small intrinsic scatter of only 0.2 dex .",
    "if the galaxy underwent abnormally intense gc destruction , that should manifest itself by a substantial displacement from this mean value . adopting the galactic gc system mass from @xcite ( @xmath87 ) and a total mass of the galaxy ranging between @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain @xmath92 ranging between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the numbers involved , one would conclude that @xmath92 is rather typical ( if perhaps a bit on the low side ) , which suggests that gc destruction at the levels inferred from our results is a universal process .",
    "the fact that such a high rate of gc destruction is so finely tuned over a large range of galaxy masses and types is quite remarkable , and should be the subject of careful theoretical examination .",
    "as pointed out in section  [ intro ] , all components of the galaxy contribute to the stellar mass within its inner few kpc .",
    "thus , what we call our `` bulge '' sample is in fact the superposition of all stellar populations lying within the range of galactic coordinates and distances specified in section  [ data]which certainly includes halo , thin and thick disk , bar and perhaps a classical bulge .",
    "the mdfs in figure  [ mdfs ] provide clues as to the nature of the n - rich stars in our sample . as pointed out in section  [ lowmet ] , the mdf of the n - rich population and that of the rest of the sample are very different .",
    "the bulge mdf extends towards above solar metallicity , whereas that of the n - rich population peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath01 , suggesting in fact an association with the thick disk or halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "examination of the incidence of n - rich stars in other regions of the galaxy can help decide between these two possibilities .",
    "an association with the galactic halo or thick disk can be tested by searching for n - rich stars in other parts of these galactic components , and checking whether the observed numbers match expectations based on the frequency of n - rich stars in the inner galaxy .",
    "we start by comparing our numbers with those obtained by other groups from analysis of sdss - segue data for halo stars at larger galactocentric distances . @xcite and",
    "@xcite estimated the total contribution of gc stars to the halo mass budget ( 10 - 20% ) that is very similar to that resulting from the minimal scenario .",
    "however , their estimate is based on a much larger primordial fg / sg ratio , which is far more compatible with that assumed for our maximal scenario ( see below ) .",
    "assuming there is no strong reason for one to adopt different fg / sg ratios for inner and outer halo , one would end up with a substantial variation in the contribution of the halo stellar mass by gc stars as a function of galactocentric distance . adopting the fg / sg ratio from the minimal scenario , the contribution to the halo mass inferred from @xcite and @xcite",
    "would be reduced by a factor of a few to several .",
    "indeed , in a more recent effort based on apogee dr12 data , @xcite searched for n - rich stars in high - latitude halo fields adopting a definition that is consistent with that described in section  [ data ] . from a resulting sample of 5 halo n - rich stars , they concluded that , adopting a fg / sg ratio consistent with our minimal scenario , the contribution of dissolved gcs to the halo mass would be @xmath04% . in conclusion , there are fewer n - rich stars in the dr12 apogee halo sample , by a factor of @xmath0 5 , than expected if the frequency of those stars was the same across the entire halo .",
    "the above approach suffers from a basic limitation stemming from the small relative size of the apogee halo sample .",
    "we exploit the much larger apogee sample at low galactic latitudes for a statistically more robust comparison between expected and observed n - rich star numbers . for that purpose , we perform the following exercise .",
    "we first use models to estimate the `` component - specific '' frequency of n - rich stars under the assumption of their association to each of those components , then use that frequency to estimate the expected number of n - rich stars in other regions of the galaxy . by `` component - specific '' frequency ,",
    "we mean the fraction of the halo or thick - disk stars that are n - rich if the n - rich stars found in the inner galaxy are assumed to be associated entirely with with either of those components .",
    "this estimate requires knowledge of the breakdown of the stellar mass in the inner galaxy among various galactic components . for that purpose",
    ", we adopt the besanon models by @xcite , which match stellar counts in 2mass and sdss by considering a combination of four components : a thick disk , a thin disk , a halo , and a bar .",
    "no classical bulge was needed in order to fit the data for the inner galaxy .",
    "the mass breakdown among the various components within a cylinder with 2  kpc radius and 4  kpc height located at the galactic centre is as follows :      next , using survey simulations based on the same models we calculate how many n - rich stars are expected in the apogee sample of low latitude fields with @xmath99 and @xmath100 if they were associated with either thick disk or halo .",
    "the expected number of n - rich stars integrated within all that area of sky is given by :      where @xmath102 is the total number of stars observed by apogee within that area , @xmath103 is the fraction of those stars belonging to either the thick disk or the halo , and @xmath104 is the component - specific frequency of n - rich stars in that area of the sky .",
    "we take @xmath103 from survey simulations based on the besanon models and estimate @xmath104 from a combination of the observed frequency of n - rich stars in our bulge fields and model estimates for the contribution of thick - disk and halo stars to the volume sampled , so that      where @xmath106 is the number of stars observed within the apogee bulge fields , @xmath107 is the number of those among the latter who are n - rich , and @xmath108 is the component - specific frequency of n - rich stars in the inner galaxy , according to survey simulations . for this exercise ,",
    "we limit the sample to stars with [ fe / h]@xmath109 , where the contribution by halo and thick disk populations is maximal .    in table",
