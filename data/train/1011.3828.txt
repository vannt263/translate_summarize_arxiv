    "solution of the full set of equations as required in numerical simulations of reactive flows with detailed chemical kinetics represents a quite challenging task even for today super - computers .",
    "the one reason is the large number of kinetic equations needed for tracking each chemical species . on the other side ,",
    "detailed combustion mechanisms are typical _ multi - scale problems _ where different chemical processes , characterized by disparate timescales ranging over several orders of magnitude ( from seconds down to nanoseconds ) are present . as a result",
    ", modeling detailed combustion fields comes with a tremendous cost where intensive long simulations are needed to resolve the fastest processes , though one is often interested in the slow dynamics .",
    "thus simplification methodologies become , other than highly desirable , mandatory in combustion problems where detailed mechanisms for heavy hydrocarbons ( with hundreds chemical species ) are used in 2- and 3d simulations .",
    "notice that , there exist often chemical processes that are much faster than the fluid dynamic phenomena , so if we are only interested in computing the system behavior on the time - scale of the fluid mechanics , some chemical processes will be already equilibrated and thus _ slaved to _ the remaining dynamics .    in fact , modern simplification techniques are based on a systematic decoupling of the fast equilibrating chemical processes from the rest of the dynamics , and are typically implemented by seeking a _ low dimensional manifold _ of slow motions in the solution space of the detailed system .",
    "much effort has been devoted to setting up such automated model reduction procedures .",
    "the method of invariant grids ( mig ) @xcite , the computational singular perturbation ( csp ) method @xcite , the intrinsic low dimensional manifold ( ildm ) @xcite , the invariant constrained equilibrium edge preimage curve method ( ice - pic ) @xcite , and the method of minimal entropy production trajectories ( mept ) @xcite are a few popular techniques .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce an approximated procedure for the fast computation of detailed combustion fields . to this end",
    "we adopt the novel relaxation redistribution method ( rrm ) @xcite for the construction of a reduced model of the mechanism grimech 3.0 describing ideal mixtures of air and methane ( 53 chemical species , 4 elements and 325 reactions ) in a closed system under fixed pressure and mixture - averaged enthalpy .",
    "the latter description serves , at a later time , for reconstructing all the missing chemical species in a computationally efficient reactive flow simulation performed with a single - step reaction model .",
    "the paper is organized in sections as follows .",
    "the notion of slow invariant manifold and the chemical kinetics equations are briefly reviewed in section [ sim.notion ] and [ sec.equations ] , respectively .",
    "the relaxation redistribution method is discussed in section [ overview_relaxation ] . a reduced model for air and methane",
    "is used in a planar counter - flow flame simulation in section [ rfs ] , and conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the notions of _ slow invariant manifold _ for a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations in a domain @xmath0 in @xmath1 , @xmath2 for more details , the interested reader is delegated to the dedicated literature @xcite .",
    "a manifold @xmath3 is _ invariant _ with respect to the system ( [ sys ] ) if inclusion @xmath4 implies that @xmath5 for all future time @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , if the tangent space @xmath7 to @xmath8 is defined at @xmath9 , invariance requires : @xmath10 in order to transform the latter condition into an equation , it proves convenient to introduce projector operators .",
    "let for any subspace @xmath7 a projector @xmath11 onto @xmath7 be defined with image @xmath12 .",
    "then the necessary differential condition can be expressed by : @xmath13 where the left - hand side of equation [ inveq ] is often called _ defect of invariance _",
    "it is worth stressing that , although the notion of invariance discussed above is relatively straightforward , _ slowness _ instead is much more delicate .",
    "we just notice that the most part of invariant manifolds are not suitable for model reduction ( all semi - trajectory are , by a definition , 1d invariant manifold ) . in this respect , we should also point out that _ slow manifolds _ are not uniquely defined in the literature and , in general , different methods delivers different objects . here ,",
    "we follow the approach of the method of invariant grid ( mig ) @xcite , where slowness is intended as _ stability _ ,",
    "thus sim are the _ stable stationary solution _ of a relaxation process ( _ film equation _ ) @xmath15",
    "we notice that the unknown of both ( [ inveq ] ) and ( [ film ] ) is the manifold @xmath8 , which can be conveniently represented in a parametric form , as mapping @xmath16 of a domain @xmath17 ( reduced space or parameter space in the following ) into the phase - space @xmath0 ; @xmath8 being the image of this mapping : @xmath18 .",
    "here , we consider closed reactive systems with fixed mixture - averaged enthalpy @xmath19 , and total pressure @xmath20 where @xmath21 chemical species and @xmath22 elements participate in a complex network of elementary reactions .",
    "species compositions are represented in terms of mass fractions @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 denoting the mass of species @xmath26 and the total mass , respectively .",
    "the mixture enthalpy , at a temperature @xmath27 , can be expressed as @xmath28 , while the governing equations in a closed reactor take the form @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mixture density , while @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 denote the molecular weight the molar concentration rate and specific enthalpy of species @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "following chemkin @xcite , the specific enthalpy can be approximated by a polynomial fit as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the tabulated nasa coefficient and @xmath36 the universal gas constant .",
    "molar concentration rates take the explicit form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the stoichiometric coefficients of the @xmath40-th elementary reaction @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath40-th reaction rate @xmath42 is expressed using the popular _ mass action law _ : @xmath43^{\\alpha_{ij } } - k_j^- \\prod_{i=1}^{n } \\left [ x_i \\right]^{\\beta_{ij}},\\ ] ] with @xmath44 $ ] denoting the molar concentration of the @xmath26th species and @xmath45 the @xmath40-th reaction rate constant typically expressed in the arrhenius form @xcite .",
    "in the following , we use a discrete representation for manifolds referred to as _ grids _",
    "@xcite , consisting of a set of _ interconnected _ nodes , where it is assumed that the nearest neighbors of an arbitrary node @xmath9 can be identified .",
    "a grid is defined by the restriction of mapping @xmath46 on the discrete subset of the parameter space @xmath47@xmath48 into the phase space @xmath0 , whereas and _ invariant grid _ satisfies the grid version of the invariance equation : @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "notice that , thanks to the node _ connectivity _ , it is possible to compute local tangent space hence the projector @xmath11 ( e.g. using approximated differential operators ) .      here",

    ", the grid becomes dense in a neighborhood of the steady state and coarse far from it , when keeping relaxing .",
