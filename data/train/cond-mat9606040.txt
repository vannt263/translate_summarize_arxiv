    "the influence of defects on the statics and dynamics of structural phase transitions has been of considerable theoretical interest over the past two decades @xcite . especially the appearence of a narrow central peak in the neutron scattering cross section , well above the transition temperature , for both distortive @xcite and elastic structural transitions @xcite , prompted various theoretical studies dealing with local ordering phenomena around short  range static defects ( for a review of the experimental facts , see ref .",

    "@xcite a one  dimensional model for continuous distortive structural transitions was studied , with the order parameter coupling to a single defect ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if the impurity locally increases the transition temperature @xmath2 of the pure system , this leads to a local condensation of the order parameter in the defect vicinity . in higher dimensions , for this local order parameter condensation to occur , the defect potential strength must exceed a certain minimal threshold . such locally ordered regions in the material emerging well above the pure transition temperature @xmath2 have played a prominent role in some of the theories attempting to explain the central peak phenomenon for distortive and elastic structural phase transitions @xcite . in this paper , we extend previous work on second  order ferroelastic phase transitions in @xmath7 @xcite to higher space dimensions @xmath8 , taking into account the crystalline anisotropy . to this end",
    ", we shall generalize the methods developed for the distortive case @xcite to ( anisotropic ) elastic systems , thus treating consistently a random impurity system with finite defect concentration @xmath0 ( in the thermodynamic limit , both the number of lattice sites @xmath9 and the number of defects @xmath10 , but @xmath11 ) .    in the framework of our mean ",
    "field approach , we shall find that defects which locally soften the crystal may induce a true phase transition at a temperature @xmath12 .",
    "below this defect  induced phase transition temperature a spatially inhomogeneous order parameter emerges , whose average value remains very small in the vicinity of @xmath1 and only becomes noticeable near @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , thermodynamic quantities ( static susceptibility , specific heat , etc . ) display prominent , broadened maxima near @xmath2 suggesting a `` rounded '' phase transition ; however , the `` true '' singularities occur at @xmath1 , but may not be seen in experiment at all , as their amplitude is only proportional to the defect concentration @xmath0",
    ". the bragg peaks of the low  temperature phase already appear in the scattering cross section for @xmath13 ; as a consequence of the spatial inhomogeneity of the order parameter , they are accompanied by elastic huang scattering peaks with finite @xmath14 width . furthermore , very close to @xmath1 an additional dynamic central peak emerges , which may be interpreted as a dynamical precursor to the defect  induced phase transition .",
    "these mean  field results of course neglect order parameter fluctuations , and exaggerate cooperative behavior . in reality , at @xmath15 localized order parameter clusters appear , whose orientations however strongly fluctuate in space . only at a lower temperature @xmath16 (",

    "induced transition temperature , we consider the cluster orientations as effectively ising  like degrees of freedom , and then determine the cluster ordering temperature @xmath17 by calculating the free  energy difference of states with parallel and opposite orientation , respectively .",
    "thus the onset of the order parameter , the bragg peaks , and the huang scattering will be shifted to somewhat lower temperatures , and the results of this work can essentially be used if @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath17 .",

    "the following figures refer to a three  dimensional system with a single one  dimensional soft sector .",
    "we have tried to use model parameters appropriate for @xmath82 , which displays a second  order elastic phase transition near @xmath83 @xcite ; accordingly , we have used numerical values calculated from refs .",
    "@xcite ( table i ) .",
    "thus , we have taken @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and adjusted the defect strength in order that @xmath86 . however ,",
    "a few remarks are in place here to explain some sources of inaccuracies .",
    "the assumption that the ginzburg ",
    "landau parameter @xmath28 is merely linearly temperature  dependent is valid only near the phase transition temperature of the pure system @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore we approximated @xmath31 and @xmath30 as independent of temperature , and in addition assumed @xmath30 to be independent of the direction of the @xmath5 vector in the stiff plane .",
    "this is not generally the case for @xmath82 , but appears to describe the critical region well .",
    "the numerical values of the diffusion constant @xmath87 and the nonlinearity @xmath8 ( see below ) had to be estimated without reference to any experiment .",
    "fig.1 depicts the phonon correlation function @xmath88 [ eq.([fdt ] ) ] for different temperatures @xmath89 , evaluated for several angles @xmath90 between the external wave vector and the soft sector .",
    "as becomes apparent in fig.1 , a dynamical central peak in the phonon correlation function emerges in addition to the soft phonon peak ( compare ref.@xcite for the one  dimensional case ) .",
    "the height of the central peak grows , and its width decreases as @xmath1 is approached .",
    "the intensity of the central peak decreases upon increasing the angle @xmath90 between the wave vector @xmath5 and the soft sector .",
    "this reflects the fact that wavevectors in the stiff sector do not probe the critical properties of the material .",
    "the dynamical central peak may thus be understood as a dynamic precursor to the defect  induced second  order phase transition at @xmath1 .",
    "in this section , we use a self  consistent approach designed for the calculation of the order parameter @xmath91 , the specific heat , the phonon correlation function and finally the dynamical structure factor in the ordered phase , i.e. , for @xmath13 .      the starting point for the calculation of the order parameter",
    "is the full nonlinear ginzburg  landau functional , which in the discrete lattice representation reads @xmath92 here @xmath93 denotes the value at lattice site @xmath94 of that combination of strain tensor components serving as the order parameter for the transition , @xmath95 is the corresponding external stress acting on site @xmath94 , and the static propagator @xmath96 is defined by its fourier transform @xmath97 in the framework of the ginzburg ",
    "landau approximation , i.e. , neglecting order parameter fluctuations , the following stationarity condition can be derived ( with @xmath98 ) @xmath99 a general solution of eq.([stats ] ) , with its combined nonlinearity and randomness , poses a difficult problem .",
    "we thus use an additional approximation , namely the following ansatz @xcite for the thermodynamical average of the order parameter ( denoted by @xmath100 ) , @xmath101 i.e. : we assume that the order parameter at each lattice point @xmath94 may be written as the sum of a homogeneous background @xmath102 and an additional contribution @xmath103 , if there is a defect at site @xmath94 , thus enhancing the total value of the order parameter to @xmath104 at the defect sites .",
    "thus we explicitly assume that at all defect sites the order parameter points in the same direction , and in addition neglect the spatial variation of the order parameter near the defects .",
    "however , as we shall see shortly , the second , seemingly very crude approximation already contains the possible relevant modifications caused by the impurities , namely ( i ) an enhancement of the spatially averaged order parameter ( corresponding to the parameter @xmath102 ) , and ( ii ) the ensuing `` screening '' of the defect potential ( described by the coefficient @xmath103 ) .",
    "the more stringent approximation is the uniform orientation of the defect clusters , as implied by the mean  field approach ( see sec .",
    "v ) .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ deppi ] ) into the stationarity equation ( [ stats ] ) yields the recursion relation @xmath105 where we have introduced a renormalized propagator @xmath106 and a screened defect potential @xmath107 with weakened strength [ see eq.([stupsi ] ) ] @xmath108 \\ .\\ ] ] from eq.([sabine ] ) and the averaged stationarity equation we may derive two coupled nonlinear equations that uniquely determine the mean order parameter : ( i ) iterating the recursion relation ( [ sabine ] ) in a similar way as for the dynamics in the previous paragraph , performing the configurational average , and summing the single  site contributions , one arrives at @xmath109^{-1 } \\ , \\ ] ] with the abbreviation @xmath110 ( ii ) on the other hand , immediate averaging of eq.([sabine ] ) yields @xmath111 very assuringly , eqs.([rita ] ) and ( [ pia ] ) yield non  zero solutions for @xmath112 precisely below @xmath1 as determined from the high  temperature phase .",
    "fig.2 shows that the order parameter of the perturbed system as function of @xmath113 looks similar to the corresponding curve for the pure system , with the singularity at @xmath2 being smeared out by the disorder .",
    "the order parameter sets in continuously at @xmath1 , with the usual mean ",
    "field exponent @xmath114 , assumes small but finite values in the range @xmath115 , and starts to grow to larger values only in the vicinity of @xmath2 .",
    "thus the transition temperature of the pure system remains an important parameter even in the perturbed system , while the true phase transition at @xmath1 may in fact be hardly noticeable in experiments .",
    "as before , the results for a three  dimensional system with one one  dimensional soft sector are depicted , but the qualitative features remain essentially the same in the cases of a two or three  dimensional soft sector .      from the knowledge of the mean order parameter , we can readily calculate the ( averaged ) free energy from eq.([ginzi ] ) in landau approximation , and via @xmath116 derive the specific heat @xmath117 , see fig.3 .",
    "obviously , the discontinuity at @xmath2 has been smeared out , in place of which a tiny jump emerges at @xmath1 . although the phase transition clearly occurs at @xmath1 , the transition temperature @xmath2 of the pure system remains of considerable importance ; e.g. , there is a distinct maximum of the specific heat near @xmath2 , while the extremely minute jump at @xmath1 might not be experimentally detectable at all .      in order to find the phonon correlation function in the temperature region with a finite order parameter , one again has to start from the full ginzburg  landau functional and use the ansatz for the order parameter ( [ deppi ] ) .",
    "the crucial point is that one may then absorb the nonlinear term of the equation of motion in modified coefficients of the linear terms as follows @xmath118 with these modifications one can use the same equations as in the high  temperature phase .",
    "the result is depicted in fig.4 .",
    "the central peak in the correlation function disappears again when the temperature is lowered below @xmath1 .",
    "this dynamical central peak is thus confined to the region around @xmath1 . as in the high  temperature phase ,",
    "the intensity of the central peak decreases upon increasing the angle between the external @xmath5 vector and the soft sector ( with fixed temperature ) .    in fig.5 the static phonon susceptibility @xmath119 ( i.e. , the inverse elastic constant , as modified by the defects ) is shown .",
    "the small but sharp peak at @xmath1 reflects the preordering of the defect regions , while the broad and much more prominent peak near @xmath2 corresponds to the ordering of the pure bulk crystal , though under the influence of the randomly spaced fields originating from the defect clusters ; compare figs.2 and 3 .      in order to describe scattering experiments",
    ", we have to calculate the density  density correlation function of sec.2 . the first term in eq.([struc ] ) yields the bragg scattering , and does not require any further comment ; the third term is connected with the phonon correlation function , and has been discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to the second term . taking into account the soft acoustic phonon mode only ,",
    "as above , we have to calculate the configurational average of @xmath120 [ eq.([huang ] ) ] ; using the same approximations as in the beginning of sec.3 , we may use equation ( [ sabine ] ) in the form @xmath121 which yields @xmath122 for this equation again a diagrammatic representation can be derived @xcite , and in single ",
    "site approximation ( i.e. : to order @xmath0 ) we find the following result ( @xmath123 denotes the components of the wave vector which are parallel to the polarization of the soft mode ) @xmath124^{-2 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression can be further reduced using eq .",
    "( [ rita ] ) .",

    "fig.6 shows how the intensity of the huang scattering varies with temperature for different wave vectors @xmath128 in the soft sector .",
    "this additional elastic contribution sets in at @xmath1 , and then grows to considerable values near @xmath2 .",
    "all our previous results for the statics were based entirely on the ginzburg ",
    "landau approximation , and dynamic quantities were calculated in the gaussian ensemble .",
    "this mean  field treatment of course neglects fluctuations , and apart from the fact that the critical exponents will be changed near the transition , we have to consider the possibility that the above described defect  induced phase transition at @xmath1 will disappear when fluctuations are properly taken into account .",
    "namely , our mean  field approach basically implies that as soon as local condensates form near the defects , they immediately lock into some cooperative state and form a non  vanishing average order parameter . in reality , probably first these clusters may emerge at the defect positions , however still quite independently fluctuating between their different possible orientations . only as the temperature is lowered even further",
    ", they will form a collective vibrational mode which finally condenses to a static order parameter at the `` true '' transition temperature @xmath17 , with @xmath129 , the mean  field transition temperature .",
    "one would expect that such collective behavior of the distinct localized order parameter clusters arises when the correlation length of the pure system @xmath130 , which determines the size of the defect  induced condensates , becomes of the order of the average defect separation @xmath131 . a somewhat more favorable estimate results from the argument that it should actually suffice when @xmath130 becomes large enough such that the distinct condensates form a percolating cluster throughout the sample ; the condition for cooperative behavior then becomes @xmath132 , where @xmath133 denotes the percolation threshold .    in the following",
    "we give a more precise estimate @xmath17 , in order to see if it may still be considerably above the transition temperature of the pure system @xmath2 .",
    "our strategy is to calculate the free  energy difference @xmath134 between the following two configurations in a two  defect system below the temperature where localized clusters may form in two different orientations : ( i ) both order parameter condensates oriented in the same direction , and ( ii ) opposite condensate orientations .",
    "the ensemble of localized clusters can then be effectively mapped onto an ising system , with @xmath134 assuming the role of the exchange coupling .",
    "the critical temperature is now readily estimated as @xmath135 ( @xmath136 is the volume of the elementary cell ) .",
    "we emphasize that we shall restrict ourselves to an isotropic system here , and consider the general case of an order parameter @xmath137 described by the usual ginzburg ",
    "landau expansion of the free energy , which rather corresponds to the case of distortive structural transitions , as studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior is expected to be very similar for the anisotropic elastic phase transitions .    using the continuum representation ,",
    "the free energy for a system in three dimensions with a single defect in the origin reads @xcite @xmath138 \\varphi({\\bf r})^2      +",

    "the stationarity equation then becomes @xmath141 \\varphi({\\bf r } )                                                        + d \\varphi({\\bf r})^3 \\ , \\ ] ] which for @xmath142 may be approximately solved by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the correlation length of the pure system for @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , with @xmath148 denoting the minimum defect strength required for the local order parameter condensation to occur .",
    "using these results , we can proceed towards the two  defect system with @xmath149 $ ] by a simple linear superposition ansatz ; i.e. , we shall evaluate the free energy difference between the states @xmath150 by inserting into eq .",
    "( [ freeen ] ) one readily finds the defect contribution @xmath151 as well as the linear overlap integral ( conveniently evaluated using elliptical coordinates ) @xmath152 the nonlinear overlap integral turns out to be of order @xmath153 and can thus be neglected for @xmath154 , when compared to the previous terms .",
    "hence we find for the required free  energy difference @xmath155 using the above numerical values , we see that the defect contribution can in fact be neglected here .",
    "hence we arrive at our final estimate for the cluster ordering temperature , which we identify with the `` true '' defect ",

    "we conclude this section with the remark that the upper critical dimension as function of the dimension @xmath18 of the soft sector was found to be @xcite @xmath163 thus in three dimensions mean  field theory yields exact results for a system with a one  dimensional soft sector , while for the case of a two  dimensional soft sector merely logarithmic corrections are to be expected .",
    "we now return to the case of elastic phase transitions , and address the question of the influence of extended defects in contrast to the previously treated point disorder .",
    "our system now contains randomly placed , but parallel linear or planar defects ; the accordingly modified correlated defect potential ( compare eq .",
    "[ defpot ] ) , reads in the case of line disorder @xmath164 where @xmath165 are the components of @xmath166 , and @xmath167 denotes the direction parallel to the lines ; @xmath168 labels the @xmath35 line defects .",
    "the defect potential for planar defects is defined analogously , namely for planes normal to the @xmath169 direction @xmath170 with these definitions the same calculations as before may be performed , and it becomes obvious that the former integrals reduce to integrals over the @xmath5 vectors perpendicular to the defects .",
    "one gets qualitatively the same results as in the case of point defects .    in order to compare the effect of the different kinds of defects , we have calculated the order parameter in all three cases ( points , lines , and planes ) for the same defect strenght and the same defect concentration ( i.e.",
    ", the extended defects are viewed as correlated accumulations of point defects with the total number of  pointlike  defects held fixed ) .",
    "therefore , the resulting differences solely originate in the different disorder dimensionality .",
    "the one  dimensional soft sector was taken to be perpendicular to the defects in order to provide a meaningful comparison .",

    "[ opdim ] ; it can be seen that the effect of the defects is not a monotonous function of their dimensionality , but depends on the strength of two competing effects . on the one hand , when the temperature is lowered towards the phase transition temperature and the correlation length @xmath130 grows accordingly , the order parameter cluster around a @xmath171dimensional defect grows proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "this effect renders low  dimensional defects more effective in influencing bulk properties . on the other hand",
    ", the system has a finite stiffness , characterized by the parameter @xmath31 ; and as a system with uncorrelated defects is more inhomogeneous than one with the identical amount of correlated disorder , this effect favors high  dimensional defects , because then the system stiffness can be more easily overcome by the joint action of neighboring defects . with the specific numerical values we have used , the line defects have only a tiny effect on the order parameter curve in comparison with the point defects .",
    "the effect of the planar defects lies in between .",
    "we emphasize that this scenario could be different for other values of the stiffness parameter @xmath31 .",
    "finally , we remark that if one performs the above calculations for a system with extended defects , where the soft sector is not perpendicular to the defects , additional angle dependences ensue , and one has to add an additional term of the form @xmath173 to the functional ( [ fritzi ] ) , in order to correctly account for the stiffness , which tends to prevent the building  up of order parameter clusters .",
    "in this paper we have studied the influence of point and extended defects on a @xmath8dimensional elastic system with an @xmath18dimensional soft sector undergoing an elastic phase transition of second order .",
    "we have calculated the phonon  phonon correlation function in the high  temperature phase . at a certain temperature @xmath174 , an instability marking a defect  induced phase transition may emerge , if the defect potentials are sufficiently strong . above @xmath1",
    "a dynamical central peak emerges in the phonon correlation function , whose intensity grows as the temperature is lowered towards @xmath1 .",
    "contrary to the case of distortive phase transitions @xcite , the maximum of the central peak is exactly at @xmath175 for all temperatures and not at small but finite frequencies @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not imply that the acoustic impurity modes are localized ; at least for a simplifying one  dimensional single ",
    "defect model no additional localized impurity modes appear , but the defect rather causes a localized vibrational contribution to the propagating scattering states ; for the long  wavelength phonons this quasi  resonant vibration then condenses at @xmath1 and forms the local order parameter clusters @xcite . the dynamical central peak may be regarded as precursor of this phase transition ; its height also depends on the angle between the external wave vector @xmath5 and the soft sector .",
    "the smaller this angle , the more pronounced is the central peak .    in the low  temperature phase @xmath13 , where a finite , and be it ever so small , order parameter exists ,",
    "we have used a self  consistent mean  field calculation in order to calculate the average order parameter , the free energy and specific heat , and the phonon correlation function .",
    "the order parameter sets in continuously at @xmath1 , remains very small in the temperature range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and reaches appreciable values only near @xmath2 . in this way",
    "the order parameter curve resembles a somewhat rounded curve of the pure system .",
    "analogously , the temperature dependence of the specific heat looks like the corresponding smeared  out curve for the pure system . the jump at @xmath2 is rounded , and a minute jump at @xmath1 appears .",
    "thus the phase transition of the perturbed system no longer occurs at @xmath2 but at @xmath1 .",
    "however , the phase transition temperature @xmath2 of the pure system remains important , as the remnants of the pure transitions induce marked , but rounded maxima in quantities like the order parameter susceptibility or the specific heat near @xmath2 .",
    "having thus determined the order parameter , we were able to calculate the phonon correlation function in the ordered phase .",
    "the dynamical central peak disappears again as the temperature is lowered below @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence of the central peak on the angle between the momentum transfer vector @xmath5 and the soft sector is very similar as above @xmath1 .",
    "the density ",
    "density correlation function determining the cross section for scattering experiments consists of three terms : first , the term describing elastic bragg scattering , second , a term corresponding to huang scattering caused by the spatially inhomogeneous order parameter configuration ; this term yields a contribution to elastic scattering , leading to a static central peak with finite @xmath4 width .",
    "the third term finally describes inelastic scattering and has been discussed along with the phonon correlation function .",
    "we have also discussed the validity of our mean  field approach and provided an estimate ( in the isotropic case ) for the `` true '' precursor @xmath176 , defined as the cluster ordering temperature @xmath17 , which has to be distinguished from the temperature @xmath1 where localized , but fluctuating order parameter clusters appear . only below @xmath17 , the previously independent ordered regions",
    "form a collective state leading to a non  zero average order parameter . generally , cooperative behavior of the defects is to be expected when the correlation length of the pure system @xmath130 becomes of the order of the mean defect separation @xmath131 .",
    "although the ensuing cluster ordering temperature is considerably lower than @xmath1 , the qualitative features of the present theory should remain largely unaffected , provided @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath17 ; i.e. , the mean order parameter appears rounded near @xmath2 , while static order parameter susceptibility and the specific heat display a strong but broadened maximum there .",
    "furthermore , in the anisotropic systems under consideration here , fluctuations may actually be suppressed , rendering mean  field theory more reliable .",
    "finally , the time scale of the order parameter condensate fluctuations will diverge @xmath177 upon approaching @xmath17 , which in experiment would eventually render them indistinguishable from static inhomogeneities , leading to quasi ",
    "elastic bragg and huang scattering peaks .",
    "we have also investigated the case of parallel extended defects ( lines and planes ) , and found essentially the same features @xcite .",
    "these considerations led us to the qualitative phase diagram displayed in fig.7 .",
    "for very tiny disorder concentrations , the picture of isolated defects applies .",
    "although preordered clusters may form considerably above @xmath2 , the ensuing condensates fluctuate independently and do not form a state with nonzero average order parameter .",
    "the cluster reorientation rate will become very low as @xmath2 is approached , and coupling of these slow modes to the soft ( acoustic ) phonons will then lead to a dynamical central peak , see ref .",
    "@xcite . for higher , but still small defect concentrations , the clusters emerging at @xmath178 will form a state with preordered defect regions and finite , but small average order parameter below @xmath17 .",
    "this phase transition leads to discontinuities in thermodynamic quantities , like the specific heat or the static susceptibility , which are , however , probably unnoticeably small in experiment . on the other hand , upon approaching @xmath2 , the phase transition temperature of the pure crystal , the bulk system orders ; due to the influence of the preordered defect regions , the transition temperature will be slightly higher than @xmath2 , and the formerly sharp singularities of the mean order parameter , specific heat , and static susceptibility appear characteristically rounded .",
    "the above described theory applies precisely to this concentration range ( for very strong disorder the single ",
    "site approximation breaks down ) .",
    "the central peak phenomenon is thus explained by a combination of elastic bragg peaks of the low  temperature phase and static huang scattering with finite width in @xmath14 space .",
    "however , a different scenario is also conceivable , namely that as the cluster reorientation times become very long , the different , still independent condensates freeze in with spatially fluctuating orientations .",
    "the ensuing configuration would constitute a metastable state which is separated from the true ground state by high free energy barriers @xmath179",
    ". the typical flip rate would then be proportional to @xmath180 ; therefore , at low temperatures the true thermodynamic ground state may not be reached . in the spirit of the discussion in sec.v",
    "one could possibly map this problem onto a random  field ising model ( for recent reviews , see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the lower critical dimension of which is @xmath181 , and therefore long  range order is not destroyed in three dimensions .    at last , we would like to contrast our picture with that of `` glassy '' systems .",
    "although some of the features of the dynamical structure factor in glasses are at least qualitatively similar , e.g. , an elastic peak with finite @xmath14 width appears , and the static susceptibility and specific heat may display characteristically rounded and broadened maxima , there are important differences .",
    "first , the order parameter of the pure crystal @xmath100 would not constitute an appropriate order parameter for such a disordered , glassy system .",
    "second , the character of the phase transition should be entirely different , and in fact lead to experimentally distinguishable behavior .",
    "the scenario described here is a genuine second  order phase transition , though induced by disorder ( which locally softens the system ) ; i.e. : critical phenomena are confined to regions very close to @xmath1 ( or @xmath17 ) , and to wave vectors in the soft sector with @xmath182 .",
    "the freezing  in into a glassy state , on the other hand , would have to be described by an ergodicity  breaking ( edwards  anderson ) order parameter , and should actually be rather insensitive to @xmath4 .",
    "such a glass instability occurs , e.g. , in orientational glasses @xcite , and possibly in relaxor ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that for the case of first ",
    "order martensitic transformations , a model with disorder of the random @xmath176 type has been proposed , which can then be mapped onto a spin glass , and the ensuing glassy features were suggested to explain the prominent tweed microstructure found in these materials , as well as the central peak phenomenon there @xcite .",
