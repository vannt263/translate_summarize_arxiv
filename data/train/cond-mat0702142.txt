    "<S> rubidium 87 atoms are trapped in an ioffe - pritchard potential generated with a persistent supercurrent that flows in a loop circuit patterned on a sapphire surface . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting circuit is a closed loop made of 100 @xmath0 m wide mbe - grown mgb@xmath1 stripe carrying a supercurrent of 2.5  a. to control the supercurrent in the stripe , an on - chip thermal switch operated by a focused argon - ion laser is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the switch operates as an on / off switch of the supercurrent , or as a device to set the current to a specific value with the aid of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the current can be set even without an external source if the change is in decreasing direction .    </S>",
    "<S> an atom chip is a device to manipulate atoms near a solid surface with inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by current carrying conductors constructed on a surface . </S>",
    "<S> it has been used to trap and guide atoms @xcite , to create quantum degenerate states of atomic gases @xcite and to make atom interferometers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a merit of using micro magnetic structures is a strong trapping confinement that is achievable with a relatively small current . </S>",
    "<S> the shorter the distance between the potential minimum and the conductor , the larger the potential gradient gets , and atoms are more easily trapped or guided in a single spatial mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , a shorter atom - surface distance causes a faster decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> it has been reported that , when atoms are trapped with normal current at room temperature , inhomogeneous structures of wires for current , technical noise of the current source , as well as johnson and rf noise by thermal fluctuations cause a large disturbance in the vicinity of a solid surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for these reasons an atom chip with a smaller disturbance from the surface is strongly desired for high - quality on - chip applications like guided atom interferometers or quantum information processing devices .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the trapping of rb atoms on a chip by using a supercurrent instead of a normal current was reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the resistance of a superconductor is zero , we may expect the reduction of current noise . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cryogenic temperature will help to reduce thermal noise and improve the background pressure , which contributes to the reduction of loss of atoms from the trap . </S>",
    "<S> in former experiments , however , the superconducting circuit was connected to the external current source that was operated at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we report in this paper the first demonstration of a magnetic atom trap that is generated by a persistent current on a closed superconducting circuit . </S>",
    "<S> the removal of external power source will further reduce the thermal disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition it should be noted that the persistent current loop is a macroscopic quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> since the atom - chip trap can hold various kinds of macroscopic quantum system of atoms including bose - einstein condensates , our system provides an unique opportunity to study physics of coupled macroscopic quantum systems of widely different origin . to manipulate atoms with closed supercurrent circuits , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to control currents on the chip . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we developed a laser - driven thermal switch @xcite to control the supercurrent .        </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was done with a two chamber vacuum system ( fig .  [ vacuum ] ) to keep small background pressure in the atom - chip region . </S>",
    "<S> the first chamber is a glass cell , where @xmath2rb atoms in the 5  @xmath3s@xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 state are trapped in a conventional six beam magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite and cooled further by polarization - gradient cooling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atoms are then optically pumped to the @xmath7 state and are trapped in the quadrupole magnetic trap ( qmt ) that uses the same anti - helmholtz coils as the mot . </S>",
    "<S> the trapped atoms are transported to the second chamber by moving the coils for the magnetic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the first chamber is evacuated with an ion getter pump to @xmath8 torr . </S>",
    "<S> the second chamber is pumped with another ion getter pump together with a ti - sublimation pump to @xmath9 torr . </S>",
    "<S> the two chambers are connected with a gate valve and a narrow tube ( @xmath10 10 @xmath11 60 mm ) for differential pumping . </S>",
    "<S> the second chamber , which we call the chip - chamber , contains an atom - chip that is mounted on the bottom of a cold finger attached to a liquid helium pot that can be cooled to 2.5  k by pumping helium vapor . </S>",
    "<S> the cryogenic system has a 2  w cooling power and the base temperature is usually kept at 4.2  k. the chip is shielded from black body radiation by a gold coated copper shield at 15  k. the radiation shield has five openings ; one for the transfer of atoms and the other four that are equipped with ar coated glass windows ( @xmath10 20  mm ) for optical access .    </S>",
    "<S> after the atomic cloud is transferred to the chip - chamber , it is adiabatically shifted upwards by applying an additional magnetic field pointing in the vertical direction ( z - axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the center of the qmt is within the capture range of the chip potential , the quadrupole and the z - bias field are turned off and a magnetic field parallel to the y - axis is gradually applied . </S>",
    "<S> then the atomic cloud is recaptured in an ioffe - pritchard type trap generated by the y - bias magnetic field and the persistent supercurrent .    </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath18 adiabatically follows @xmath27 ( the arrow from b to c ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the laser is switched off , the persistent current @xmath18 is preserved and @xmath28 returns to the original value ( the arrow from c to d).,height=207 ]    to test the dynamics of the thermal switch we did the following experiments . when the laser is switched on , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the superconducting stripe starts to increase , and at some time the current @xmath18 flowing through the circuit becomes equal to the critical current @xmath27 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the supercurrent should break . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the inductance of the circuit is small , @xmath29  nh , the released power from the loop current is too small to completely break the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the supercurrent @xmath18 continues to flow keeping its magnitude to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> when the temperature reached @xmath30 the supercurrent becomes zero . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that we can set @xmath18 to any value below the initial magnitude only by adjusting the duration time of the laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we illuminated the appendix of the inner loop by the laser and estimated the current left over in the loop from the image of trapped atoms . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath38 fitted well to an empirical function @xmath39 with the values @xmath40  j , @xmath35  w , and @xmath41  s. by considering the limiting case , one may interpret that @xmath42 is the minimum laser energy deposited in the chip to break the supercurrent , and @xmath43 is the minimum power of a continuous laser required to keep the heated part of the circuit above @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath45 is caused by the delay of the mechanical shutter , which is used for the laser switching , from the timing signal . </S>",
    "<S> note that the minimum laser power required to switch the current is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than the cooling capacity of our cryogenic system , and that many switches can be installed on a chip . </S>",
    "<S> when the chip surface is heated , the heat conduction expands the heated area much beyond the size of the supercurrent stripe . </S>",
    "<S> this area is estimated from @xmath42 . assuming the energy from the laser is deposited spherically , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the heat capacity per volume of al@xmath12o@xmath48 at @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath49 is the radius of the sphere . in this expression we took into account that @xmath47 changes approximately proportional to @xmath50 . inserting @xmath51  jk@xmath52cm@xmath20 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath54  mm . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> if two thermal switches are to be installed they must be separated at least by 2  mm .    the thermal switch can be operated in principle at any point of the circuit . </S>",
    "<S> we measured also the switching characteristics of the outer loop by illuminating the laser at the point that is marked by l in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pschip ] . </S>",
    "<S> the termination of supercurrent was determined by the onset of a finite resistance between b and b terminals . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown by the dotted curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ delaytime ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath55  j is approximately 2.5 times larger than the case of the switching at the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> this , we believe , is due to the wider width of the outer loop conductor . </S>",
    "<S> the laser power required to switch should scale up with the width of the superconducting stripe . </S>",
    "<S> several other methods are possible to reduce the laser power requirement . </S>",
    "<S> grooves on both sides of the conductive stripe reduces the thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> deposition of absorptive material on the stripe and a laser with longer wavelength will heat more efficiently and localize the heating of the chip .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have trapped atoms with a magnetic potential generated by a persistent supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> the persistent supercurrent was controlled with an on - chip thermal switch driven by a laser . with a persistent supercurrent atom chip , a long decoherence time </S>",
    "<S> is expected even at a very small distance from the chip surface . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this technique will help to realize a spatial single - mode waveguide and trap for atoms , which is applicable for high - quality on - chip applications like guided atom interferometers or quantum information processing devices . </S>",
