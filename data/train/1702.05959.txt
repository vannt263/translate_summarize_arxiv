    "photons , due to its nature of low interaction with the environment , is the most popular candidate of an information carrier for secure quantum communication .",
    "the technology of light transmission has been well developed , which raises its popularity . however , because a photon is not well suited for local manipulation , a photonic state must be converted to a stationary state of a solid system for storage and information processing @xcite .",
    "in fact , various methods for such a state conversion have been studied @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) effect can be employed to switch the couplings between the metastable states of atoms and an optical field to preserve the state once the photon has been absorbed into the atoms @xcite .",

    "now let us consider the general configuration of a quantum memory system . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : quantummemory ] , it consists of two subsystems : the buffer subsystem and the memory subsystem . the buffer subsystem is coupled to both the external field and the memory subsystem , while the memory subsystem is only coupled to the buffer subsystem .",
    "the interaction between the two subsystems can be controlled by an on / off switching signal @xmath1 so that the quantum state is preserved inside the memory subsystem once all the state is fed into it . given a physical system having the above configuration , then the problem is how to design an efficient or even optimal transfer , storage , and retrieval processes .",
    "for instance , for an atomic quantum memory incorporating the eit effect , we find some methods that compute a time - varying control signal @xmath1 achieving optimal state transfer , based on the information gained from the leaking output @xcite .",
    "also , for a wide class of open quantum systems , i.e. , _ passive linear quantum systems _ such as a large atomic ensemble and an opto - mechanical crystal array @xcite , the general procedure for achieving a _ perfect _ state transfer was developed @xcite ; in particular , it was found that the pulse shape of an input photon , @xmath2 , must be the generalized _ rising - exponential _ function to accomplish the perfect state transfer if the on signal takes a constant value .",

    "the contribution of this paper is to solve the above mentioned issue ; that is , for a general passive linear quantum system having the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quantummemory ] , we develop an optimal control theory for computing a low - complexity pulse function @xmath2 of an input single - photon that can be perfectly absorbed into the memory subsystem , by employing a time - varying control signal @xmath1 .",
    "this idea is based on the fact that , in contrast to the difficulty for shaping a complex pulse function of a single - photon field in an experiment , there are many setups where even a complicated and fast control signal can be easily implemented using a laser pulse shaping ; this fact has been demonstrated in the field of quantum ( open - loop ) optimal control @xcite .",
    "that is , our method can be used to make the perfect state transfer protocol more feasible , by converting the complexity of @xmath2 ( hard to implement ) to that of @xmath1 ( easy to implement compared to @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that a similar approach , but for a concrete example , was developed in @xcite ; a remarkable difference of these works to our approach is that in their setup the input pulse function @xmath2 is _ given _ and then the optimal control _ maximizing _ the storage efficiency is computed ; note thus that , in this setup , the state transfer is in general not perfect .",

    "thus , the simple rising exponential function does not transfer the state into the memory subsystem perfectly , except the case where the system is a single - mode system ; see the footnote in page  6 .",

    "in this paper , we have formulated the optimal control problem that computes the best pair of a low - complexity unimodal input pulse function of a single - photon state and the corresponding control signal , which achieves the perfect state transfer .",
    "the numerical simulations demonstrated that , thanks to the aid of time - varying control signal , a unimodal input pulse function is obtained , which is simpler than the generalized rising exponential function obtained when a constant control is employed .",
    "we again note that the advantage of this method , which simplifies the pulse function at the expense of shaping the control signal , relies on the fact that implementing a time - varying control signal is in general more feasible than the task for shaping a complex waveform of a single - photon , and the fact that a flexible tuning of a unimodal pulse function is experimentally realizable .",
    "the future work includes verifying the actual shape of a single - photon input pulse which is feasible to generate in an experiment .",
    "we also point out that the analysis of this paper is limited to the case where the pulse function and the control signal have the exact form calculated from the numerical optimization .",
    "the performance may change significantly , if some unwanted noise are present , and thus the robustness analysis is crucial for practical application .",
