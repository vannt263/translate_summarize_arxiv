    "in this proceedings , we summarize our work on the determination of the topological susceptibility and zero mode size distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath0 gauge fields using the overlap formalism . most of this work has appeared in print  @xcite .",
    "we will focus here on new results which are extensions of the published work , namely the topological susceptibility for @xmath1 pure gauge theory , the zero mode size distribution for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and the density of zero eigenvalues @xmath2 for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the role of the zero eigenvalue density can be found in the proceedings of the plenary talk given by narayanan  @xcite .",
    "the overlap formalism for constructing a chiral gauge theory on the lattice  @xcite provides a natural definition of the index , @xmath3 , of the associated chiral dirac operator .",
    "the index is equal to half the difference of negative and positive eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the usual wilson ",
    "dirac operator ( we will use negative sign for the mass term throughout ) .    on the lattice , because of the additive mass renormalization , the crossings of zero occur at positive @xmath6 and spread out in @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to see , that no eigenvalues of @xmath7 can be zero for @xmath8 . since in the free case the first doublers become massless at @xmath9",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath10 . a simple way to compute the index @xmath3 is to compute the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath7 at some suitably small @xmath6 before any crossings of zero occurred .",
    "then @xmath6 is slowly varied and the number and direction of zero crossings are tracked .",
    "the net number at some @xmath11 is the index of the overlap chiral dirac operator .",
    "we have applied this procedure to compute the index , which we take as the definition of topological charge on the lattice , of various gauge field ensembles with gauge group su(3 ) including pure gauge , symanzik improved pure gauge , and two dynamical flavor generated gauge fields  @xcite , and recently pure gauge su(2 ) .",
    "we found that the zero crossings start occurring at some , ensemble dependent , @xmath12 and continue occurring for all @xmath6 in @xmath13 in sufficiently large lattice volumes .",
    "hence , the spectral gap is closed in the entire range .    to further investigate the zero level crossings , we compute the density of zero eigenvalues @xmath14 for @xmath7 by fitting the integrated density @xmath15 to a line through the origin for some cutoff @xmath16 . by studying the scaling of @xmath14 for quenched @xmath0",
    ", we conclude that the density of zero eigenvalues falls exponentially in the inverse lattice spacing and only vanishes in the continuum limit ( see figure  6 of narayanan s talk  @xcite ) .",
    "we will observe latter that these zeros are due to small localized modes .",
    "more discussion can be found in the talk of narayanan  @xcite .",
    "using the index of the chiral dirac operator as our ( fermionic ) definition of the topological charge of the gauge field background , we obtain the topological susceptibility @xmath17 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "all of the gauge ensembles studied have the general characteristic that the susceptibility rises sharply in the region where @xmath14 is peaked , and then it essentially flattens out in the region where @xmath14 is small  @xcite .",
    "we define a size of the eigenvector associated with the level crossing zero mode @xmath18 motivated by the thooft zero mode  @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the eigenvectors of @xmath21 .",
    "another definition based on the second moment of @xmath22 was used in ref .",
    "we should emphasize that we look only at the sizes of eigenmodes that cross , and only close to the crossing point . only then",
    "can we expect to get a good estimate of the localization size inspired by the t hooft zero mode .",
    "we show in figure  [ b6.0_all ] a detailed study of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 pure gauge ensemble . on the first line",
    "is shown the density of zero eigenvalues @xmath14 and the number of crossings in each mass bin .",
    "since there are a nonzero number of crossings , we see that @xmath14 does indeed measure zero eigenvalues , and not just small eigenvalues near zero .",
    "we also see that @xmath14 rises sharply in @xmath6 , then falls to a nonzero value where there is a small number of zero level crossings .    on the second line of figure  [ b6.0_all ]",
    ", we show the size of the zero modes @xmath25 .",
    "the modes are large near @xmath26 where @xmath14 is large , then @xmath27 drops to about @xmath28 or @xmath29 lattice spacings up to @xmath9 .",
    "we see that the corresponding @xmath17 rises sharply when @xmath27 is large for @xmath6 near @xmath26 , then is quite stable when @xmath27 is small .",
    "this result show that while the index , @xmath3 , of the field is @xmath6 dependent , @xmath17 ( a physical quantity ) is independent of the contribution from the small modes for @xmath30 .    to further clarify the relative contribution of the zero modes , in the last line of figure  [ b6.0_all ] the zero mode size distribution",
    "is shown which peaks for @xmath31 . in the adjacent graph ,",
    "@xmath17 , here defined by the contribution of zero modes of size @xmath27 and larger , is stable when @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the small modes do not affect the estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "our estimates of @xmath17 are shown in table  [ tab : results ] where we use the string tension value @xmath32(mev ) to set the scale .",
    "our results are in rough agreement with other groups  @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ dn_all ] we plot the zero mode size distribution for several @xmath33 s for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which is of interest for the instanton liquid model .",
    "we find the distributions always peaks for sizes about @xmath28 - @xmath29 lattice spacings . for @xmath0 , we see small secondary peaks at @xmath34fm for @xmath23 and @xmath35 .",
    "however , there is only a shoulder for @xmath36 at @xmath37fm . for @xmath1 which are all the same lattice size , we find the secondary peaks shift to smaller @xmath27 for increasing @xmath33 .",
    "these secondary peaks do not occur at any general physical radius and are consistent with a finite volume effect .",
