    "+ the authors of @xcite , @xcite showed that in this case the problem could be studied from a point of view of continuous field theory version of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the proposition is the following : at first , to use cft symmetries for construction of qism structures at the scale invariant fixed point and then to study the integrable perturbed model by obtained qism tools .",
    "our object of study is a model based on the superconformal symmetry ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the superconformal field theory has been applied to the physics of 2d disordered systems , to the study of lattice models ( the tricritical ising model ) and to the superstring physics .",
    "we build basic structures of qism : quantum monodromy matrices , rtt - relation and fusion relations for the transfer matrices , using underlying superconformal symmetry .",
    "+ the @xmath0 supersymmetric korteweg - de vries theory ( super - kdv ) @xcite-@xcite is used as a classical limit of our quantum system . due to the drinfeld - sokolov reduction of the @xmath2 affine superalgebra ,",

    "then the super - virasoro module is considered , where the quantum versions of integrals of motion ( i m ) act .",
    "vertex operators are also introduced , to build quantum monodromy matrix .",
    "+ the algebraic structure corresponding to the quantum case , coincides with the quantum superalgebra @xmath3 .",
