    "throughout the biological literature , the term `` diffusion in genotype space '' is used to describe a population acting under genetic drift in the absence of selection .",
    "this is not diffusion at the _ individual _ level , but at the _ population _ level , where the individuals form clusters resembling a species , the mean position of which performs a random walk i.e. diffuses .",
    "the ` species ' may consist of a number of clusters at any given time .",
    "however , these clusters remain close together , and the species is limited in the maximal width that it can achieve in any given direction in the space @xcite .",
    "clustering phenomena are well understood for reproducing and dying organisms dispersing in real space @xcite . in the case of real space ,",
    "the relationship of the microscopic process to the stochastic partial differential equation ( pde ) formalism is clear , due to the ( exact ) field theory mapping @xcite of the underlying microscopic process to a stochastic pde .",
    "however , no such translation has been done in the case of type ( sequence ) space , be it of a genotype or a phenotype , where clustering phenomena are also observed @xcite .",
    "we perform the translation and show that reproducing and dying organisms either diffusing in real space or mutating in type space are fundamentally the same process in an infinite population .",
    "this equivalence only applies in the infinite population limit , and so we provide finite size corrections to the stochastic pde , allowing for individuals to mutate only on a birth event . from known results for diffusing organisms , there exists an ` upper - critical dimension ' @xmath0 , above which general ` mean field ' results hold but below which the behaviour is different .",
    "a phenotype forms a one dimensional type space , which can be thought of as a single trait .",
    "conversely , we consider a genotype as a very long amino acid string , and hence genotype space is high dimensional as mutations are free to occur at a large number of independent positions .",
    "therefore there exists an important distinction between the evolution of a given phenotype , and a genotype .",
    "the theory of critical branching processes @xcite finds that in high dimensions describing genotype space ( @xmath1 , where in our case the critical dimension @xmath2 @xcite ) , birth / death dynamics are described fully by the lineages .",
    "a lineage remains distinct until all individuals in it die .",
    "however , in low dimensions ( @xmath3 ) describing a particular phenotype , additional clustering within the distribution of the lineage occurs .",
    "although sometimes distinct , the clusters in phenotype space can merge , and hence clusters are poorly defined entities .",
    "instead , a careful average over the distribution called a ` peak ' provides a more useful description of phenotypes @xcite .",
    "critical branching processes have a total population that does a random walk and only surviving lineages with @xmath4 are considered . for real space birth / death processes , the same phenomological clustering and upper - critical dimension @xmath2",
    "are also found when considering systems of fixed population size @xcite .",
    "as we show that neutral evolution has the same description in the infinite population limit as critical branching processes in real space , this result also applies to evolution , and for qualitative studies we can choose whether to consider systems of fixed or fluctuating total population .",
    "we use the technique of second quantisation of a master equation and mapping to a field theory@xcite , for which most previous work focuses on the infinite population limit . however , field theory is a good tool for obtaining analytical results for finite and changing population sizes , as is the case for real populations .",
    "the technique was developed in the setting of reaction - diffusion systems , where particles diffuse continuously , unlike our case of diffusion in a type space _ where the diffusion only occurs on a birth or death event_.    this paper addresses three main issues :    1 .   we discuss how a microscopic model of evolution can be represented as a field theory , and derive the stochastic pde that follows in this case .",
    "2 .   understanding the ` asymptotic ' behaviour , i.e. the infinite population and long wavelength properties of evolution , by identifying that this is a solved problem .",
    "super brownian motion and critical branching processes provide a wealth of results which are made explicit by the comparison of the relevant stochastic pdes .",
    "3 .   relating the asymptotic behaviour to the behaviour at finite population size .",
    "we will use known results of birth / death processes from the field of critical branching processes , which tackles similar problems to field theory techniques but differs in approach and terminology .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give more details , and a more direct technique is used in @xcite .    as discussed above ,",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively different above and below a critical dimension @xmath0 . in the language of statistics , for @xmath3",
    "the only stable solution is a @xmath5 measure in the correlations between individuals - i.e. all individuals are fully correlated in their position .",
    "this implies that all individuals are localised in space so that their distribution collapses to a point when viewed at very large length - scales . in unscaled type space",
    ", this corresponds to a local peak _ with a characteristic width _ ( @xmath6 ) i.e. a length - scale .",
    "the length - scale @xmath6 scales to @xmath7 in the infinite population limit for @xmath3 .",
    "however , for @xmath8 other non - trivial measures exist describing the correlations in the system , which correspond to a distribution of individuals spread out over a number of lineages .",
    "the distribution of time since last ancestor forms a power - law distribution in the infinite population limit , and since lineages typically do not intersect in high dimensions , there is no characteristic width to the distribution ( and hence no length - scale ) .",
    "the theorems available for the clustering process are usually devoted to deriving general behavioural properties , such as the convergence to either of the above measures in various dimensions .",
    "many clustering phenomena are described by the same scaling relations for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a label for a particular phenomena ( e.g. birth / death processes in euclidean space , as our model ) .",
    "thus each model may have a different critical dimension , but above that the scaling behaviour is the same .",
    "examples are given in @xcite : galton watson trees embedded into space ( which is the real space diffusion version of our model ) have @xmath11 , directed percolation @xcite has @xmath12 , percolation has @xmath13 and lattice trees ( a lineage tree embedded in a lattice so that separate lineages never meet ) have @xmath14 .",
    "all dimensions refer to the number of spatial dimensions - the stochastic process consists of the extra dimension of time . below the critical dimension",
    "each model behaves specially , however above the critical dimension all models follow the same scaling relation .",
    "all of these models can be described as a birth / death process embedded in some type of space .",
    "super brownian motion is the limiting process of all of the above processes for @xmath1 .",
    "this can be described by a stochastic pde in many cases . in the case of galton - watson trees",
    "@xcite , in terms of the density @xmath15 as a function of space @xmath16 and time @xmath17 , the stochastic pde is :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the diffusion constant and @xmath20 is a constant describing the magnitude of the noise .",
    "we will obtain this functional form in the infinite population limit for the case of evolution in type space , which with some dimensional analysis means that evolution as we define it has @xmath11 .",
    "we consider @xmath21 individuals at time @xmath17 , and each individual has a discrete type @xmath22 , which it _ retains during its lifetime_. the dimension of type space @xmath23 is arbitrary in the formalism .",
    "a timestep consists of performing a birth attempt with probability @xmath24 , or otherwise a killing attempt occurs .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath25 throughout this discussion .",
    "time is measured in generations and increases by the average waiting time between events , @xmath26 per timestep .    *",
    "birth attempt : a parent individual ( with type @xmath16 ) is selected at random , and an offspring is created with type @xmath16 and mutated with probability @xmath27 .",
    "a mutation involves @xmath16 changing by @xmath28 in a randomly chosen direction . *",
    "killing attempt : a randomly chosen individual is removed .",
    "this definition differs from the case of a birth / death process with diffusion in real space , where all individuals are diffusing constantly between birth / death events .",
    "our model permits ` diffusion ' only on birth events via mutation .",
    "a sample run is shown in figure ( [ fig : sampledistrib ] ) for an early and late time , and a sample distribution from diffusion is shown for comparison .",
    "simulations at different @xmath29 show that there is a clustering behaviour that persists regardless of @xmath29 ( not shown , though see @xcite ) .",
    "we wish to understand how the clustering depends on dimensionality , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",

    "6 .   a stochastic pde in our case can easily be obtained from @xmath43 , providing access to other techniques or , in our case , previous results .",
    "we find that additional terms appear in the field theory due to the insistence that movement only occurs on a birth ; these are difficult to deal with in analytical calculations .",
    "these terms are negligible in the infinite population limit , in which case our model reduces to the real space birth / death process with diffusion of individuals .",
    "this is a previously solved case , as discussed in section [ subsec : knownres ] .",
