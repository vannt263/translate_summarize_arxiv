    "as early as 1959 , bumba & kivsk found a small flare ( or luminosity increase ) preceding a main solar flare and introduced a term preflare to address the weak effects on the solar atmosphere produced by them .",
    "early studies have been reviewed by martin ( 1980 ) and gaizauskas ( 1989 ) .",
    "thanks to the development of recent advanced observing technique for obtaining high spatial and temporal resolution data , preflare activities are frequently identified .",
    "the common preflare activities include formation of sigmoid in soft x - ray ( liu et al .",
    "2010 ) , filament activities , such as rise , oscillation , and eruption ( chifor et .",
    "al . 2006 ; isobe , & tripathi 2006 ; vemareddy et .",
    "al . 2012 ) , and transient brightening in multi - wavelengths ( h@xmath0 ( contarino et al . 2003 ) , uv and euv ( cheng et al . 1985 ) , 1600  continuum emission ( warren & warshall 2001 ) , soft x - ray ( frnk et al . 1998 ) , hard x - ray ( harrison et al .",
    "1985 ; tappin 1991 ; asai et al . 2005 ;",
    "chifor et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "these multi - wavelengths studies settle with the questions concerning the geometry of the magnetic field , the changing physical properties of the plasma trapped in those fields , particle accelerations , and the relationship between the preflare and the main activities .",
    "it is imperative to improve our knowledge of magnetic field and plasma conditions in current sheets at preflare phase for resolving the flare problems .",
    "such studies can be guided by radio observations , which often carry details of the dynamical plasma processes not visible at other wavelengths . especially in the microwave frequency range , it is always regarded as direct signal of flaring primary energy - releasing and particle accelerations .",
    "preflare activities in microwave are discovered long ago to consist of changes in intensity and/or polarization of the microwaves emitted from an active region some tens of minutes before the onset of a flare ( kundu , 1965 ; lang , 1980 ; hurford & zirin , 1982 ; kai , nakajima , and kosugi , 1983 ; xie et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "recently , many fine structures of narrow bandwidth and short duration which are usually superimposed on smooth background continuum emission were recorded frequently for the development of broadband radio spectrometers with high temporal and frequency resolution ( fu et al . 2004a ; fu et al .",
    "2004b ; huang et al .",
    "2008 ; huang & tan 2012 ; tan 2013 ) .",
    "they are important signatures for understanding energy release and particle acceleration in solar flares .",
    "most detailed analyses of microwave fine structures reported in the literature focus mainly on the impulsive or decay phase of the flare , with little attention paid to the preflare phase .",
    "successful observations for doing study on preflare phase require a high sensitivity and signal to noise ratio of data , and simultaneous image observations to determine the host region .",
    "the microwave emissions ( especially at centimeter and decimeter wavelengths ) originate in the lower corona and the chromosphere , which provide an independent means of exploring the solar atmosphere .",
    "a good observational understanding of preflare activities , based on high - sensitivity spectrograms with broadband in microwave , and high spatial and temporal resolution filtergrams in multi - wavelengths will certainly help us to understand the nature of solar flares .",
    "after a recent advanced upgrading , the ondejov radio spectrographs ( orsc ) have the capability to observe solar microwave emission with high frequency resolution , high temporal resolution , and high sensitivity . additionally , with the launch of solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , full disk filtergrams of the sun from chromosphere to the corona up to 0.5 @xmath1 above the solar limb with 0.6 arcsecond spatial resolution and 12 seconds temporal resolution can be obtained daily at euv wavelengths by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , lemen et al .",
    "preflare activities which recorded by orsc and aia simultaneously will provide a unique opportunity to reveal some key processes of flares , such as the causality consequence , the actual trigger mechanism and the primary energy release region .",
    "moreover , despite the differences in size , energy and morphology , solar eruptions in the solar atmosphere , such as flare , filament eruption and coronal mass ejection ( cme ) , may be different aspects of a common physical process involving plasma ejection and magnetic reconnection ( e.g. shibata , 1999 ; priest & forbes 2002 ) .",
    "so the preflare activities are important not only for the initiation of flares , but also for all accompanying eruptive phenomena .",
    "studying the distinct preflare phenomena could shed new light on one of the most important puzzle of space weather which is understanding why flares , filaments and cmes erupt .    both from a theoretical point of view ( for understanding the flare phenomenon ) and a practical point of view ( for forecasting where and when a flare will occur ) , it is essential to make a closer study of preflare conditions in active regions . in this work ,",
    "we report the observations of preflare activities in the form of microwave fine structure of four solar flares . here",
    ", preflare activity is defined as a transient event preceding the goes flare at the site of the flare region for which direct physical associations with flare are implied .",
    "the observations and sample will present in section 2 .",
    "the main results will be addressed in section 3 .",
    "conclusions and discussions will be listed in section 4 .",
    "in this work , the preflare microwave fine structures were recorded by orsc , which are broadband spectrometers located at ondejov , the czech republic ( jiika et al . 1993 ) .",

    ", orsc has high spectral and temporal resolution , and high sensitivity in broadband microwave frequency range .",
    "the spectral resolution is 5 mhz and the temporal resolution is 10 ms .",
    "the quick look images can be obtained from website ( http://www.asu.cas.cz/@xmath2radio/info.htm ) .    in order to get a comprehensive understanding to the preflares , we also use other multi - wavelength observations from several instruments , including :    \\(1 ) phoenix-4 at bleien observatory    since all preflare activities in our sample occurred at the low frequency side of rt5",
    ", we adopt the radio observations in the low frequency range of 200 - 800 mhz recorded by a seven meters dish with a crossed logarithmic periodic antenna ( phoenix-4 ) at bleien observatory ( east ) to get the full information of the spectral properties of radio bursts in preflares .",
    "its frequency resolution is several mhz and temporal resolution is 250 ms .",
    "the temporal resolution of phoenix-4 is much longer than that of microwave fine structures .",
    "so here , we just use it to show the profile of the fully radio burst and as a complementary observation to determine the low frequency limit of some bursts .",

    "2996 flares ( including c , m , and x class flares ) were recorded by goes and 240 radio bursts were recorded by orsc .",

    "we have studied the properties of microwave fine structures in the preflare phase and the associated activities in the source regions observed at multiple wavelengths ( such as hard x - ray of rhessi , uv and euv of aia / sdo , etc . ) .",

    "the main observational results are as follows :    \\(1 ) there are some microwave bursts with spectral fine structures occurring in the preflare phase of the mentioned flare events .",
    "these fine structures appeared at about 1 4 minutes before the start of goes flares in the flare host region , for which direct physical associations with flares are implied . among the four events , very short period qpps occurred in one short duration flare ( c5.5 flare on 2011 december 25 ) , while small - scale burst , like dot burst groups , occurred in other three long duration flares ( c4.4 flare on 2010 august 01 , c3.2 flare event on 2010 august 14 , and m1.9 flare on 2012 may 07 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) there is only one type of microwave spectral fine structure which was identified in the preflare phase for each flare .",
    "the microwave qpps appeared at about 2 minutes before the flare .",
    "their durations are in the time period from several tenth to several seconds , and their frequency bandwidths are in the range of several hundreds mhz .",
    "their periods are of several tenth seconds which belong to very short period qpps . while the microwave dot bursts appeared at about 14 minutes before the flare .",
    "they are all in great cluster with duration longer than 10 seconds . meanwhile , the duration and frequency range for each dot is about several tens milliseconds and several tenth mhz .",
    "\\(4 ) for all four events , except one occurred in the rhessi night time , the other three events have an obviously hxr flux enhancement . as",
    "for the c5.5 flare on 2011 december 25 , accompanying the microwave qpps in the preflare , the rhessi hxr images were obtained in 3  6 kev , 6  12 kev , and 12  25 kev .",
    "it shows the presence of single source in 3  6 kev and 6  12 kev and double sources in 12  25 kev .",
    "the rhessi sources were located on the polarity inverse line and near the initial brightening in uv / euv images .",
    "\\(5 ) from sdo observations , we found that for all events , the beginning of the flare can be marked by filament arise or plasma ejection , and simultaneously associated with the loop brightening or loops interactions .",
    "this work investigated a series of solar flares and confirmed the relationships between the preflare radio bursts and the flare activities in four flares . from these investigations",
    ", we find that there are several observational activities occurring several minutes before the flare start .",
    "these activities include :    \\1 .",
    "microwave bursts with spectral fine structures at relatively weak intensity and very short timescales .",
    "these fine structures occurred in the frequency range of 0.3 ghz  1.5 ghz , including microwave qpps with very short period of 0.1 - 0.3 s and dot bursts with millisecond timescales and narrow frequency bandwidths .",
    "in fact , the above three different observational activities are closely related to each other essentially .",
    "both of the subsecond microwave spectral fine structures and hxr enhancements indicate the activities of electron acceleration and primary energy release . consequently , these releasing energy and the energetic electrons may trigger the plasma motion in the source region , and result in the sigmoid filament ascending , plasma ejections , and plasma loop brightening which can be observed by the euv imaging observations .",
    "previous literatures showed that microwave bursts with spectral fine structures frequently occurred in the impulsive and decay phases of solar flares(chernov 2006 ; huang et al . 2008 ; huang & tan 2012 ) . in this work",
    ", we find that microwave bursts with spectral fine structures also occur in the preflare phase , especially the microwave qpp with subseconds and dot bursts with millisecond timescales which have similar properties as observed in previous works .",
    "many people have pointed out that it is very difficult to adopt the general mhd oscillation mechanism to explain the formation of microwave qpp with subsecond time scales ( see review of aschwanden 1987 ; nakariakov & milnikov 2009 ) . * tan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed that the resistive tearing - mode oscillations in current - carrying flare loops may modulate the nonthermal microwave emission and form qpp at subsecond periods . in this new mechanism ,",
    "the plasma loops carry electric currents with finite resistivity which may excite resistive tearing - mode instability and produce a series of magnetic islands .",
    "electrons can be accelerated near the x - points between each two adjacent islands and form energetic electron beams .",
    "the plasma may produce coherent emission when the energetic electron beams interact with the adjacent plasmas .",
    "when acceleration from x - points is modulated by the tearing - mode oscillation , microwave qpp can occur ( tan et al .",
    "the occurrence of subsecond microwave qpp implies that the electron acceleration is quasi - periodic .",
    "when acceleration from x - points are stochastic , microwave dot bursts may occur with a random distribution in the spectrogram ( tan 2013 ) .",
    "because the accelerating site is located around each x - point , it lasts very short and occurs in a small region .",
    "the microwave qpps with period of 0.1 - 0.3 s and dot bursts in the preflare reveal the following information in the flare source region : the flare loops carry electric currents , and therefore there are considerable accumulation of non - potential free energy which may consequently trigger the magnetic reconnection and electron acceleration in the flare source region .",
    "therefore , energy release may take place in the preflare as well as in the impulsive phase of the flares , although their intensities are relatively weaker than the later . *    when we investigate preflare microwave signature to understand and predict the solar flare , we always meet two critical problems .",
    "one is the definition of the start time of a flare , and the other is whether the preflare microwave signatures are rare or general . in this work",
    ", the start time of flares were extracted from goes list .",
    "the goes satellites provide continuous monitoring of the integrated full disk solar x - ray intensity in a hard ( 0.5  4  ) channel and a soft ( 1  8  ) channel .",
    "the flare start defined by sxr / goes is when four consecutive 1 minute sxr values meet all following three conditions : ( 1 ) all four values are above the background threshold ; ( 2 ) all four values are strictly increasing ; and ( 3 ) the last value is greater than 1.4 times of the first value that occurred 3 minutes earlier .",
    "meanwhile , the start time is defined as the first minute in the sequence of 4 minutes . according to this definition , it is quite natural that some small , gradual or impulsive flux enhancement which associated with small activities do exist before the goes flare .",
    "as for the second problem , preflare activities in microwave are discovered as early as 1950s by bumba & kivsk ( 1959 ) .",
    "they found that about 20% of flares in their sample are preceded by much smaller bursts on wavelength 130 cm and 56 cm . by using interferometric solar microwave data recorded by the owens valley at 10.6 ghz between feb 19 , 1980 and march 31 , 1981 ,",
    "hurford & zirin ( 1982 ) found that 15% of the flares are preceded by similar preflare signatures .",
    "the most common signature was a step - like increase in signal amplitude , accompanied by a decrease or reversal in the degree of polarization .",
    "later kai , nakajima , and kosugi ( 1983 ) also found about 26% of the flares are associated with the preflare microwave activities which related to the subsequent main energy release .",
    "xie et al .",
    "( 1994 ) studied microwave flux variation of flares at four frequency ( 1.42 , 2.13 , 2.84 , 4.26 ghz ) and found that around 30% of flares are preceded by narrow banded preflare activities .",
    "meanwhile , they found that the preflare activity occurs at the low frequencies more frequently than at the high frequencies .",
    "the rare previous studies show that radio preflare activities do not occur in a majority of cases .",
    "hurford , read , & zirin ( 1984 ) have shown that preflare bursts may occur in such narrow spectral band that they can easily be missed by instruments responding to a single frequency . here in the present work",
    ", we found that out of the 156 flare associated radio bursts , 12% ( 18 events ) of them were preceded by microwave fine structures .",
    "for the lack of corresponding image observations , only 4 events are confirmed that located in the same host region as the main flare .",
    "such preflare activities appear to be as a narrow - banded ( not greater than 1 ghz ) , short duration ( the longest duration is 40 s for impulsive radio burst ) , and weak intensity ( about 10% of the maximum flux of the main flare ) .",
    "so they can easily be missed by narrow band spectrometers .",
    "preflare activities appeared in multi - wavelength have been considered as a potential clue to understand the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere that leads to a flare eruption .",
    "especially the spectral fine structures in microwave bursts , the preflare activities can provide insights into the magnetic fields , plasma condition , and the initial motion and interaction of the plasma loops , and the primary magnetic reconnection process in the flare cradle regions .",
    "additionally , as the microwave signals are much more sensitive than the other wavelength observations , a systematic summary of the preflare characteristics can help us to predict the catastrophe solar eruptive events .",
    "however , there is no corresponding imaging observations at the related frequencies in our study , some important parameters of the source regions , such as the spatial scale , height , configurations of the source region are not clear . and without the polarization information , the parameters of the magnetic field and plasma in the source region can not be deduced , either .",
    "these information is very important for us to establish the direct connections of the microwave bursts and the multi - wavelengths activities .",
    "the forthcoming snapshot imaging observations at broad frequency bandwidth of the next generation radio telescopes ( csrh , 0.4  15 ghz , yan et al .",
    "2009 ; fasr , 0.05  20 ghz , bastian 2003 ) will provide much more abundant and confirmable information about the preflares .",
    "and then we will do further investigations on this topic , and get more insight of the flare triggering mechanism .",
