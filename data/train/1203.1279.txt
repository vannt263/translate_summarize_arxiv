    "the observed half opening angle of @xmath9 results from the intersection of the bicone with the galaxy plane .",

    ".    the strongest lines of the cones spectra are c vi , o vii triplet , o viii , o vii rrc and ne ix triplet .",
    "most lines have similar flux in both cones , except for o viii rrc which appears stronger in the nw cone , as already reported by @xcite , and the ne ix triplet which instead is stronger in the se cone .    the high resolution rgs/_xmm - newton _ spectroscopic analyses of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the soft x - ray spectrum of mrk 573 originates from photoionized and photoexcited plasma with a contribution from collisionally excited plasma . in order to evaluate the contribution of different plasma phases to the total emission we performed spectral fitting of the two cones spectra separately , making use of self - consistent photoionization models .",
    "for this purpose we produced xspec grid models with the cloudy c08.01 package , described by @xcite .",
    "we assumed the ionization source to be an agn continuum ( with a `` big bump '' temperature @xmath52 , a x - ray to uv ratio @xmath53 and an x - ray power - law component of spectral energy index @xmath54 ) illuminating a cloud with plane - parallel geometry and constant electron density @xmath55 .",

    "poor fits are obtained with a single phase ionized plasma ; the best fit models require two photoionized phases . due to low counts , the hydrogen column densities of both phases are unconstrained , so we fixed them to their best fit value of @xmath64",

    "the two gas phases show similar fluxes @xmath72 in both cones .    in almost all observations",
    "the best fit models require a thermal component ( included with an apec xspec model ) .",
    "the exception is observation 07745 on the se cone , but this is probably due to the low statistics , this being the region with the lowest counts .",
    "all other fits require this thermal component with temperature @xmath73 in the nw cone and @xmath74 in the se cone .",
    "we can therefore conclude that a two - phases photoionized plasma is diffused over the two cones , with the presence of a thermal component .      summarizing the results obtained in the spectral fits presented in sect .",
    "[ conespectra ] the two cones are characterized by mildly photoionized plasma ( @xmath75 in the nw cone and @xmath76 in the se cone ) and the presence of collisionally ionized plasma ( at a temperature @xmath73 in the nw cone and @xmath74 in the se cone ) .    as recalled in sect .",
    "[ imagedeconv ] cheers observations of mrk 573 reveal a detailed structure of the diffuse emission that is morphologically coincident with the enlr , as mapped by [ o iii ] and suggest an interplay between radio ejecta , the optical and the soft x - ray emissions ( see figure [ deconv ] ) ; the inner optical arcs appear wrapped around the radio knots , as resulting from shock interactions between the radio jets and the galactic plane , and the x - ray emission is enhanced in front of these knots , suggesting the presence of collisionally ionized gas , a picture analogous to what is observed in ngc 4151 @xcite .    to further investigate these features , we produced maps of the x - ray emission in three energy bands corresponding to some of strongest emission lines , namely the blended o vii triplet ( 0.53 - 0.63 kev ) , o viii ly@xmath10 ( 0.63 - 0.68 kev ) and ne ix triplet ( 0.90 - 0.95 kev ) , and present them in figure [ lines ] .",
    "as already observed by @xcite the o vii emission is slightly more extended in the se cone with respect to the o viii ly@xmath10 , while in the nw cone we observe an opposite behavior .",
    "the ne ix map shows spots of enhanced emission in front of the radio lobes ; these spots are also present in the ratio map of line emission shown in figure [ ratios ] , where we present ratios of ne ix to o vii and to o viii , tracing the higher ionization gas ; these maps show a nearly symmetrical structure along the two cones , characterized by regions of high ionization between the nucleus and the inner optical arcs ( regions 1 and 2 ) and regions of increased ionization lying in front of the radio knots at the interface between the inner and outer optical arcs ( regions 3 and 4 ) .",
    "these regions of increased ionization are also shown in figure [ surbri ] , where we plot variations of the ratio of [ o iii ] to 0.5 - 2 kev flux along with the distance from the nucleus , where an average conversion factor of @xmath77 , obtained by the various spectral fits we performed , is used to convert net counts in the 0.5 - 2 kev band into flux .",
    "the ratio of [ o iii ] to soft x - ray flux for a single photoionized medium is expected to have an approximatively power law dependence on the radius , depending on the radial density profile .",
    "the trends shown in figure [ surbri ] can be roughly sketched with the inner @xmath15 region corresponding to the nuclear highly photoionized phase with @xmath78 , and two outer regions corresponding to the mildly photoionized cones with @xmath79 in the nw direction and @xmath80 in the se direction , respectively .",
    "as the radio ejecta interact with the galactic plane , the regions of increased ionization shown in figure [ ratios ] can be interpreted as two different shock regions in which the radio ejecta interact with different regions of the ism , with decreasing velocities as the jet slows down moving away from the nucleus ; in particular , regions 3 and 4 feature significant dips in the [ o iii ] to soft x - ray flux ratio at the interface between the optical arcs ( see also @xcite ) , characterized by enhanced x - ray emission due to shock heating in addition to photoionization , as already observed in ngc 4151@xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the nature of the different plasma phases in these regions of enhanced ionization ( shown in figure [ ratios ] ) we extracted here soft x - ray spectra and fitted them adopting the photionization model described above , taking into account the nuclear contribution to these regions . in order to have enough counts and allow acceptable fits we extracted spectra from all observations and combined them with the specextract tool . due to the low counts in regions 3 and 4",
    ", we combined their spectra .",
    "fits results are presented in table [ otheregions ] and figure [ otheregionspectra ] .    in regions 1 and 2",
    "the best fit model requires a highly ionized phase with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and a low ionized phase with @xmath83 in region 1 and @xmath84 in region 2 ; due to low statistics the hydrogen column densities for the low ionization phase were fixed to their best fit values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in region 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum extracted from regions 3 + 4 is best fitted by a highly ionized phase with @xmath87 and a low ionized phase with @xmath88 ; in this case both hydrogen column densities were fixed to their best fit value @xmath89 .",
    "for all these regions of enhanced ionization a thermal component is statistically required ; in particular , region 1 needs a temperature @xmath90 , while in region 2 we have @xmath91 .",
    "the outer regions 3 + 4 feature a lower temperature plasma with @xmath92 , which we interpret as the origin of the enhanced x - ray emission .    to further check the location of the collisionally ionized phases we performed an analogous analysis on the [ o iii ] outer arcs .",
    "a good fit is obtained with two photoionized phases , while the inclusion of a thermal component is not statistically required , as the fitting procedure only yields an upper limit on its flux @xmath93 ( see table [ otheregions ] and figure [ otheregionspectra ] ) .",
    "this is not compatible with the fluxes found in the regions of enhanced ionization ( see table [ otheregions ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the thermal component found by @xcite and @xcite is actually composed of two physically separated plasmas , with a higher temperature phase lying between the nucleus and the inner optical arcs , and a lower temperature phase located in front of the radio knots , at the interface between the inner and outer optical arcs .",
    "cheers observations of mrk 573 show soft x - ray emission characterized by a bright nucleus and a diffuse component extending along the ionizing bicone up to @xmath30 , doubling the size reported in previous works @xcite .",
    "the spectral analysis of the diffuse emission points to the presence of a thermal component that can be interpreted as collisionally ionized gas related to radio ejecta ; moreover , significant extended emission up to @xmath94 is observed in the cross - cone direction where the obscuring torus is expected to shield the nuclear continuum according to the agn unified model . in this section",
    "we will discuss these two aspects of the diffuse emission , as well as the spectral properties of the nuclear emission .",
    "previous work on mrk 573 @xcite first suggested that the soft x - ray diffuse emission of mrk 573 can be interpreted as originating from mildly photoionized plasma with the presence of a collisionally ionized phase . with new , deep cheers observations we are able to conclude than the collisionally ionized phase ( sections [ nuclearspectra ] and [ conespectra ] )",
    "is composed of two physically separated plasmas , with a hotter plasma between the nucleus and the inner optical arcs , and a lower temperature plasma in front of the radio knots , at the interface between the inner and outer optical arcs .",
    "the collisionally ionized phases can be interpreted as the result of shock interaction between the radio knots and the galactic plane , because this is the expected location of the interaction between the ionizing cones and the galaxy plane ( see figure [ deconv ] ) ."
