    "in particular , they are consistent with the prototypical starobinsky model based an @xmath0 extension of minimal einstein gravity  @xcite , and are constraining or excluding many other models . as discussed elsewhere in this volume ,",
    "some still consider alternatives to inflation  @xcite , but we are encouraged by the progressive and impressive improvement in experimental precision to explore specific planck - compatible models in more detail . as we discuss , detailed measurements of the cmb provide a window on fundamental physics that is complementary to laboratory experiments , casting light on particle physics at energies far beyond the reach of colliders and possibly giving us insight into string compactifications .",
    "run  1 of the lhc revealed the higgs boson  @xcite , which is an existence proof for an apparently elementary scalar boson .",
    "as such , it may serve as a prototype for the inflaton , and it has been proposed that the higgs could even be the inflaton itself  @xcite . this requires a rather large non - minimal gravitational coupling of the higgs field , and seems impossible unless the standard model of particle physics is supplemented , since naive extrapolation of the standard model leads to a negative higgs potential at high scales . at the time of writing the lhc",
    "has yet to reveal any new physics beyond the standard model , but there are many reasons to expect new physics , and we consider supersymmetry to be the best - motivated possibility  @xcite .    the appearance of the higgs boson with a mass @xmath3  gev  @xcite sharpens the problem of the naturalness of the electroweak scale , which low - energy supersymmetry could mitigate .",
    "moreover , simple supersymmetric models actually predicted correctly the mass of the higgs boson  @xcite , and also that its couplings would resemble those in the standard model  @xcite - which they do , so far .",
    "these are new motivations for supersymmetry provided by run  1 of the lhc , in addition to the rles that supersymmetry could play in grand unified theories and string theory .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider supersymmetric models of inflation .",
    "supersymmetric versions of inflation were originally proposed in the context of a growing set of problems @xcite besetting the new inflationary theory @xcite based on the one - loop ( coleman - weinberg ) potential for breaking su(5 ) .",
    "for example , the vacuum tended to evolve to a minimum different from that containing the standard model @xcite , and quantum fluctuations destabilized the inflationary vacuum  @xcite unless the higgs effective quartic self - coupling was small , @xmath4 , whereas its value was fixed by the su(5 ) gauge coupling to be @xmath5 .",
    "but the biggest problem for new inflation was the magnitude of density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the new inflationary model based on su(5 ) predicted that they should be @xmath6 , whereas experimentally they are @xmath7 .",
    "several of these problems are tied to the magnitude of the effective quartic potential coupling , which must be tuned to @xmath8 to insure acceptable density fluctuations . indeed , in any model of inflation based on an elementary scalar field , its effective potential must have some parameter that is small in natural units where the reduced planck mass @xmath9  gev is set to unity . in a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "such parameters are renormalized multiplicatively , so the quantum corrections to small values are under control .",
    "for this reason , it was suggested that inflation cries out for supersymmetry  @xcite . in this framework",
    "the magnitude of the self - coupling could be linked to the ratio of supersymmetry breaking to the gut scale rather than to the gut gauge coupling alone  @xcite .",
    "tension due to fine tuning and the duration of inflation could be further relieved if the inflationary field value were separated from the gut scale and pushed to the planck scale , the scenario of primordial inflation  @xcite using a gauge singlet field  @xcite that was baptized the inflaton @xcite .",
    "primordial supersymmetric inflation made it easy to render natural the fact that the magnitude of the observed scalar density perturbations is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that any discussion of early - universe cosmology , including inflation , should also incorporate gravity in an essential way , and hence be set in the framework of supergravity  @xcite . in general , a simple supergravity theory is characterized by a hermitian function of the matter scalar fields @xmath10 , called the khler potential @xmath11 , that captures its geometry , a holomorphic function of the scalar fields , called the superpotential @xmath12 , that describes their interactions , and another holomorphic function @xmath13 that characterizes their couplings to gauge fields @xmath14  @xcite .    in minimal @xmath15 supergravity",
    ", the khler metric is flat : k = ^i _ i^ * , where the sum is over all scalar components in the theory .",
    "the simplest inflationary theory in minimal supergravity is defined by the superpotential @xcite w = m^2 ( 1 - ) ^2 , [ hrrw ] where @xmath16 is the inflaton and @xmath17 in planck units . however , because inflation in this model is effectively driven by a cubic term in the scalar potential , it leads to a prediction for a scalar perturbation spectrum with tilt , @xmath18 , which is now in serious disagreement with the determination by planck @xcite : @xmath19 .    moreover , a generic supergravity theory coupled to matter is not suitable for cosmology , because its effective scalar potential is proportial to @xmath20",
    ", scalars typically pick up masses proportional to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the hubble parameter  @xcite .",
    "though the theory defined by ( [ hrrw ] ) is constructed to avoid this @xmath23 problem , a generic inflationary model is in general plagued by this problem of large masses .",
    "in addition , the spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry introduces additional challenges for constructing a successful supergravity inflationary scenario @xcite , stemming from the introduction of a chiral superfield whose scalar components have weak - scale masses but planck - scale vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xcite  .",
    "the question then arises , which type of supergravity theory to choose for formulating models of inflation ?",
    "an attractive way to avoid the @xmath23 problem is provided  @xcite by no - scale supergravity  @xcite . in the minimal two - field case",
    "@xcite useful for inflation , its khler potential can be written in the logarithmic form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath16 are complex scalar fields and the @xmath26 represent possible additional matter fields   problem may also be avoided in theories with a shift symmetry in which the khler potential is a function @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 @xcite . in this case",
    "the danergous term arising from @xmath20 does not depend on the combination @xmath29 , which may then be chosen as the inflaton . ] .",
    "moreover , no - scale supergravity emerges as the effective four - dimensional low - energy field theory in generic compactifications of string theory  @xcite , with @xmath25 being identified as the compactification volume modulus .",
    "we therefore consider it to be the best - motivated framework for constructing field - theoretical models of inflation  @xcite .",
    "a simple version of a no - scale inflationary model is defined by the superpotential @xmath30  @xcite . however , in this model too , inflation is effectively driven by a cubic term in the scalar potential , so that it yields the same prediction @xmath18 as in the minimal model @xcite .",
    "the planck 2013 data  @xcite , with their confirmation of a tilt in the spectrum of scalar perturbations with @xmath1 and their strengthening of previous upper bounds on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath31 triggered to re - examine no - scale inflation  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the planck data are highly consistent with the predictions of the starobinsky @xmath0 model  @xcite .",

    "we review these and other recent developments in no - scale inflation , with particular emphasis on the rle of planck data in motivating and constraining no - scale models  @xcite .",

    "the spectral tilt is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , and the tensor to scalar perturbation ratio is @xmath72 .",
    "however , there is a price to be paid for the success of the starobinsky model , namely that the measured magnitude of the scalar density perturbations corresponds to a value of @xmath73 in natural units , i.e. , to an unnaturally ( ? ) large coefficient for the @xmath74 term in ( [ starob ] ) .",
    "in contrast , in the no - scale wess - zumino model the magnitude of the perturbations requires @xmath75 , which is technically natural thanks to supersymmetry .",
    "the wess - zumino superpotential is not the only way to derive the starobinsky model from no - scale supergravity .",
    "indeed , it was not even the first scenario for deriving the effective action ( [ starob ] ) from no - scale supergravity  @xcite , although the connection with inflation was not made previously to  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite exhibited a no - scale supergravity example with the superpotential @xmath76 and argued that the no - scale khler potential ( [ nsk ] ) was the only consistent supergravity extension of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in the example ( [ cecotti ] ) , the canonically - normalized real part @xmath77 of the field @xmath25 : re@xmath78 plays the rle of the inflaton , and has a starobinsky potential when @xmath16 is fixed at zero .",
    "many other starobinsky - like avatars of no - scale supergravity were derived and discussed in  @xcite . in some of these",
    "the inflaton was identified with the matter field @xmath16 in ( [ nsk ] ) , and in others it was identified with the @xmath25 field , which could be interpreted as a modulus of compactification  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to represent ( [ nsk ] ) in a more symmetric form  @xcite : @xmath79 where the complex fields @xmath80 and @xmath81 are related to the fields @xmath82 in ( [ nsk ] ) by @xmath83 it is important to note that the effective superpotential is modified when the coordinates are transformed as in ( [ tphiwrite ] ) : @xmath84 the transformation ( [ tphiwrite ] ) shows that , at the level of the khler potential ( [ k21symm ] ) that determines the geometry of the khler manifold , there is no real distinction between the  modulus \" field @xmath25 and the  matter \" field @xmath16 .",
    "however , the distinction becomes important when one considers the accompanying superpotential , which is an essential step in constructing a starobinsky avatar of no - scale supergravity .",

    "moreover , transforming back to the @xmath89 basis using the inverse of ( [ tphiwrite ] ) , we find that the the khler potential and the superpotential have exactly the forms ( [ nsk ] , [ wz ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if one interchanges @xmath90 and makes the same transformation ( [ tphiwrite ] ) , one finds the same khler potential ( [ nsk ] ) but the following superpotential : @xmath91 this yields the asymptotically dilatation - invariant effective potential @xmath92 and , making the transformation @xmath93 , we see that this example also reproduces the starobinsky potential , but with the inflaton identified as the `` modulus '' field and with @xmath16 fixed at 0",
    ".    many more examples of starobinsky - like models with the inflaton identified as either a modulus field or a matter field have been constructed and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a generic issue in these and other models of inflation inspired by string theory is how to fix the vacuum moduli , specifically in the no - scale inflationary models discussed above the @xmath25 field , which may be identified with the overall compactification volume modulus .",
    "the phenomenological approach to this problem taken in  @xcite was inspired by  @xcite , namely adding quartic terms inside the logarithm in the khler potential ( [ nsk ] ) : k = - 3 ( t + t^ * - + ) , [ ekn ] where @xmath94 is a mass scale assumed to be smaller than the planck scale , and @xmath95 is a parameter that breaks the invariance under the imaginary translations of the khler potential . for simplicity , we can choose @xmath96 , in which case the masses of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath25 are equal .",
    "a non - zero mass for @xmath25 is most easily obtained in this context by simply adding a constant term @xmath97 to the superpotential @xcite , thus breaking supersymmetry .",
    "this constant term induces a gravitino mass @xmath98 and a modulus mass @xmath99 , which is hierarchically larger than the gravitino mass . for @xmath100 , the potential for @xmath16 ( or canonical @xmath51 as in ( [ chipot ] ) ) is indistinguishable from the starobinsky potential .",
    "however , stabilization terms with similar forms have not yet been derived in string theory , whereas the corrections to ( [ nsk ] ) that have been motivated by string theory , see for example  @xcite , do not stabilize the volume modulus while maintaining the starobinsky form of the potential necessary for inflation @xcite . solving the string modulus stabilization problem lies beyond the scope of our discussion of inflation ,",
    "so we just flag it here as an important open problem .",
    "although starobinsky - like models are certainly highly consistent with the cmb data from planck and other experiments , there is scope for models with larger values of @xmath31 , so it is interesting to explore the scope for such a possibility within the no - scale supergravity framework  @xcite . as an example , we consider here a khler potential of the form  @xcite : @xmath101 ^ 2}{\\lambda^2 } \\right)+\\frac{|\\phi|^2}{(t+\\bar{t})^3 } \\ , , \\label{ourk}\\ ] ] where the second term is typical of how a matter field with modular weight @xmath102 would appear in an orbifold compactification of string  @xcite , and we postulate a superpotential of the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is some coefficient @xmath105 . in this case",

    "we see that the lower bounds are already stronger than those imposed by successful big bang nucleosynthesis ( vertical purple line ) and the 68% cl lower limit approaches the upper limit on @xmath183 suggested by gravitino decays ( vertical green line ) .",
    "thus , the planck data  @xcite already impose interesting constraints on inflaton decays in no - scale models : other examples are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one of the biggest challenges in constructing models of inflation is to relate them to particle physics at accessible ( collider ) energies .",
    "one connection may be provided in principle by the discussion of inflaton decays in the previous section  @xcite .",
    "for example , in models where the inflaton is identified with the supersymmetric partner of a singlet ( right - handed ) neutrino in a see - saw model of neutrino masses , the constraints on the two - body decay coupling @xmath172 have potential implications for low - energy observables such as flavour - changing lepton transitions as well as scenarios for neutrino mixing .",
    "another possible connection arises via supersymmetry breaking .",
    "for example , if the gauge kinetic function @xmath13 depends same non - trivially on the inflaton field @xmath16 : @xmath184 the inflaton decays into standard model gauge bosons and gauginos are given by  @xcite @xmath185 and the gaugino masses are given by @xmath186 as already commented , the vertical yellow and magenta lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : egno5 - 1 ] bracket the range of @xmath172 and hence @xmath182 found in starobinsky - like no - scale models , which correspond to @xmath187 , with the upper end of this range corresponding to @xmath188 and hence @xmath189 .    additionally , different assignments for the inflaton and matter fields lead to different possibilities for the pattern of supersymmetric particle masses , via their dependences on the model - dependent soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses @xmath190 , gaugino masses @xmath191 and bilinear and trilinear scalar couplings @xmath192 and @xmath193  @xcite . among the possibilities are the original _ no - scale _ boundary conditions @xmath194 @xcite , _ cmssm_-like boundary conditions in which @xmath195 and @xmath193 are non - zero and universal for different scalar species and determined by the gravitino mass @xcite , _ msugra_-like boundary conditions in which @xmath196 @xcite , etc . thus ,",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered and sparticle masses measured at accelerators , it may be possible constrain models of inflation , and vice versa if models of inflation can be constrained .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : eno8 ] , which displays results for a no - scale scenario with @xmath197 and @xmath198 at some input renormalization scale @xmath199 in an su(5 ) gut model with superpotential terms @xmath200 , where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are @xmath203 and @xmath204 higgs representations , respectively , for the representative values @xmath205 discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we see that , within this particular model , only a restricted range of @xmath206  gev is consistent with the lhc data .",
    "the relations ( [ m12m32 ] , [ gaugedecay ] , [ dgphi ] ) show how this type of constraint can then be applied to models of inflation and string compactification .",

    "the brown shaded regions are excluded because the lsp is charged , the green shaded regions are excluded by @xmath210 , the renormalization - group equations are unstable in the ochre shaded region of the upper panel .",
    "the relic cold dark matter density lies within the cosmological range along the narrow dark blue strips .",
    "the near - vertical continuous purple line is the atlas 95% cl lower limit on the gaugino mass @xmath191 , the dash - dotted ( red ) lines are contours of @xmath211 as calculated using feynhiggs  2.10.0  @xcite , and the solid diagonal green lines marks a 95% cl upper limit on br(@xmath212 ) .",
    "the continuous ( black ) lines in the upper panel are contours of @xmath213 , the ratio of supersymmetric higgs vevs  @xcite . _ , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "as we have reviewed in this article , no - scale supergravity is an attractive framework for constructing models of inflation , since supersymmetry accommodates naturally the required hierarchy between the scale of inflation and the planck scale  @xcite , gravity must be incorporated in any discussion of cosmology , and no - scale supergravity  @xcite emerges from generic string compactifications  @xcite and yields an effective potential that is positive semi - definite  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed various no - scale inflationary scenarios , reviewing how they naturally yield an effective potential , and hence predictions for @xmath122 and @xmath31 , that are coincident  @xcite with the planck - friendly starobinsky model based on @xmath0 gravity  @xcite . moreover , no - scale models achieve this in a technically natural way , via small superpotential couplings rather than surprisingly large non - minimal gravitational couplings as in the starobinsky and higgs inflation models .",
    "the no - scale framework is , moreover , more flexible , being able to accommodate models intermediate between the starobinsky model and a quadratic potential suitable for chaotic inflation  @xcite , which could yield larger values of @xmath31 that are still compatible with the constraints from planck and other experiments . as in other supersymmetric models of inflation",
    ", it is necessary to take into account two - field effects : in the no - scale models we study  @xcite , we find that these tend to reduce @xmath31 without generating large non - gaussianity .    in principle",
    ", no - scale inflation could provide a phenomenological bridge between string theory and collider physics  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned model - dependence of @xmath31 , the value of @xmath122 is related directly in starobinsky - like models to the number of e - folds during inflation  @xcite , which is in turn sensitive to the rate of inflaton decay and thereby the assignment of the inflaton as a modulus or matter field .",
    "the pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking is also sensitive to this assignment , and would be measurable at the lhc or in other collider experiments .",
    "as we have mentioned , open issues in no - scale inflation include the mechanism for stabilization of the various moduli , including the volume modulus that plays a prominent rle in building models .",
    "the inflationary observables are sensitive to the mechanism of modulus stabilization , and therefore may be able to cast some light on this basic issue in string phenomenology .",
    "more generally , for the foreseeable future measurements of inflationary observables are likely to take us closer to the string scale than any other experiments , and no - scale inflationary models may be the best platform for exploiting this scientific opportunity .",
