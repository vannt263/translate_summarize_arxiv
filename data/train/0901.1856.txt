    "since the pioneering work of hoover _ et al._,@xcite determining the free energy of molecular solids has been an important area of research.@xcite one of the most popular methods to compute the free energy of solids is the einstein crystal method , proposed by frenkel and ladd more than two decades ago.@xcite in this method , the free energy of a given solid is computed by designing an integration path that links the solid to an ideal einstein crystal with the same structure as the real solid , for which the free energy can be analytically computed .",
    "this method was soon extended to molecular solids.@xcite in this case , in addition to the springs that bound each molecule to its lattice position , springs that keep the particles in the right orientation must also be added.@xcite using this technique , the free energy of several atomic and molecular solids has been computed.@xcite    quite recently a new method to compute the free energies of solids which was denoted as `` the einstein molecule '' approach has been proposed.@xcite this method consists of a slight modification of the einstein crystal method . in the einstein crystal method ,",
    "the reference system is an ideal einstein crystal with the constraint that the center of mass of the system is fixed in order to avoid a quasi - divergence in the integral of the free energy change from the real solid to the reference system .",
    "this constraint introduces some complexity in the method .",
    "in particular , the derivation of some terms that contribute to the free energy is somewhat involved.@xcite the main idea behind the einstein molecule approach is that the derivation of the analytical expressions can be considerably simplified by fixing the position of one molecule instead of fixing the center of mass of the system .",
    "the einstein molecule approach has been successfully applied to compute the free energy of the hard - spheres ( hs ) and lennard - jones ( lj ) face centered cubic ( fcc ) solids . here",
    "it will be shown how it can be applied to molecular solids .",
    "moreover , even though the einstein crystal method has been extended to molecular solids more than twenty years ago , there are several subtle issues concerning the calculation of the free energy that are not clear yet .",
    "these difficulties are common to the einstein crystal and einstein molecule approaches .",
    "one of these issues concerns the shape of the simulation box . for solids with non - cubic symmetry ,",
    "prior to the computation of the free energy for a given thermodynamic state , the solid structure must be relaxed to obtain the equilibrium unit cell corresponding to that thermodynamic state .",
    "this is not usually a problem in structures with cubic symmetry , as the equilibrium structure is determined uniquely by the lattice parameter @xmath0 .",
    "however , in structures with lower symmetry , it is convenient to first perform a simulation in which both the edges and the angles that define the simulation box are allowed to relax to the equilibrium structure .",
    "this can be achieved by , previously to the free energy calculation , performing a parrinello - rahman npt simulation .",
    "other alternative would be to perform a simulation at constant volume but where the shape of the simulation box is allowed to change , i. e. , a variable - shape constant volume ( vsnvt ) simulation.@xcite we would like to stress the importance of using the equilibrium structure to compute the free energy , otherwise the solid could be under some stress that will lead to an increase of the free energy .",
    "this has already been noted previously,@xcite but , due to its importance , we believe that it is worthy to review this point .",
    "another difficulty that one might encounter when computing the free energy of molecular solids concerns the reference structure that is used either in the einstein crystal or in the einstein molecule approaches . in simple solids , in which all the particles exhibit the same orientation , this does not pose a problem , as the reference structure is chosen simply as a solid where all the particles lie on their lattice positions and are perfectly oriented .",
    "however , for more complex solids , where not all the molecules exhibit the same orientation , the choice of the reference structure might be a subtle issue .",
    "this is the case , for example , of some solid phases of water that exhibit complex unit cells . in this situation",
    "several choices are possible .",
    "one might choose to build the reference structure by using experimental data to obtain the position and orientation of the molecules or , alternatively , one might choose to perform an energy minimisation , so that each molecule will be located as to minimise the potential energy.@xcite another reasonable choice would be to calculate the average positions and orientations at the particular thermodynamic state under study . in view of this ambiguity , it is of interest to investigate the effect that one choice or another has on the calculation of the free energy .    finally , another difficulty arises from the strong size dependence of the free energy of solids . in particular , for the fcc hs solid , several authors have shown that the free energy per particle decreases linearly with @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the number of particles in the system.@xcite as a consequence , the fluid - solid coexistence point also exhibits a strong size dependence ( note that the finite size effects on the free energy of the fluid and on the equation of state of both phases must also be considered ) .",
    "the size dependence of the fluid - solid coexistence point obtained with the values of the free energy from those works@xcite is in agreement with the coexistence points calculated by wilding and bruce@xcite using a completely different route , the phase - switch monte carlo method.@xcite this strong size dependence has also been observed for other systems , such as for example , the fcc lj solid.@xcite in this case , the situation is more complicated because , in addition to the size dependence of the free energy , there is also a dependence on the cutoff of the potential .",
    "both effects must be studied separately.@xcite this means that in order to perform a rigorous calculation of the free energy of a given solid , the free energy must be computed for different system sizes , so that the value of the free energy at the thermodynamic limit can be obtained by extrapolation to @xmath2 going to infinity .",
    "however , this procedure requires performing many simulations to compute the free energy of a solid at just one thermodynamic state .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to introduce finite size corrections ( fsc ) , i.e. , a simple recipe that would allow one to estimate the value of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit from simulations of a system of finite size . in a previous paper",
    ", we have proposed several fsc whose performances were assessed for simple atomic models , namely , the hs and lj model potentials.@xcite the best performance was obtained by the so - called asymptotic fsc , in which the free energy in the thermodynamic limit is estimated from the free energy at a finite size @xmath2 by taking the limit when @xmath2 tends to infinity in the expression used to compute the free energy .",
    "depending on how this limit was taken , three different variants were proposed , and all of them give quite reasonable estimates of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , these results might not be general and , therefore , it would be of interest to check whether the fsc work well also for molecular solids .",
    "in this paper we will address all these issues concerning the computation of free energy of solids .",
    "it is our hope that this will contribute to encourage other authors to compute free energies .",
    "the paper will be structured in the following way .",
    "first , the recently proposed einstein molecule approach will be extended to the case of molecular solids and it will be shown that the results obtained for all the solids studied ( i.e. , a hard - dumbbells solid , a solid made of anisotropic particles with octahedral symmetry and the two recently discovered solid phases of water , ice xiii and ice xiv ) are in agreement , within statistical uncertainty , with the results obtained with the einstein crystal method .",
    "second , the free energy of ices xiii and xiv using the rigid non - polarizable tip4p/2005 model of water will also be calculated .",
    "these calculations will serve to illustrate the importance of obtaining the equilibrium shape of the simulation box previously to the computation of the free energy and to explore what is the best choice for the reference structure that is used in the computation of the free energy .",
    "finally , we will perform a systematic study of the size dependence of the free energy of several crystalline solids for a simple anisotropic patchy model with octahedral symmetry .",
    "the performance of the previously proposed fsc will be assessed for this model .",
    "in what follows we will consider several pair potentials , for which the intermolecular potential will be expressed as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the intermolecular potential between molecules @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first model we considered is the hard - dumbbells ( hd ) model , in which each particle consists of two hard - spheres , each of diameter @xmath7 , separated by a distance @xmath8 .",
    "the free energy of this model has already been studied previously using the einstein crystal method@xcite and also theoretically using an extension of the wertheim theory.@xcite the possible solid structures for hard - dumbbells have already been been discussed in previous works.@xcite hard - dumbbells can form a hexagonal lattice by arranging the dumbbells in such a way that each sphere of a dumbbell lies in a hexagonal layer .",
    "the dumbbell axis is then tilted from the normal to the layer by an angle equal to @xmath9 .",
    "these layers can be stacked as to form a fcc lattice ( structure designated as cp1 ) or a hcp lattice ( structure cp2 ) . in these two structures",
    "all the dumbbells exhibit the same tilt angle .",
    "another structure can be obtained by stacking the layers in such a way that the tilt angle alternates between adjacent layers ( structure designated as cp3 ) .",
    "it has been shown that only the cp1 structure is thermodynamically stable ( for @xmath10).@xcite for values of @xmath11 lower than approximately 0.4 , there is a range of pressures for which a plastic fcc crystal is the most stable phase.@xcite finally , it is also possible to form aperiodic fcc and hcp structures , i.e. , structures in which the axis of the hard - dumbells are not aligned.@xcite the aperiodic fcc structure becomes thermodynamically stable for values of the elongation @xmath11 close to unity.@xcite as the main purpose is to show that both the einstein molecule approach and the einstein crystal method lead to the same value of the free energy , we have chosen to study only the structure designated as cp1 for hard - dumbbells with @xmath12 ( for this elongation the cp1 solid is metastable ) .",
    "the interaction between water molecules was modelled using a rigid non - polarizable model potential , the tip4p/2005 water model.@xcite this model is a variant of the tip4p potential,@xcite in which the water molecule is modelled by one lj interaction site on the oxygen atom , two positive charges located on the hydrogen atom and a negative charge that is located on the h - o - h bisector .",
    "it has been shown that the tip4p model is able to predict reasonably well the phase diagram of water .",
    "it predicts that ice ih is the most stable solid phase at the normal melting point and it reproduces the densities of the solid phases of water within 2% of the experimental values.@xcite the main failure of this method seems to be a melting point about 40k below the experimental value.@xcite it was then clear that the model could be improved and several groups proposed variants of this model . in particular , the tip4p / ice model@xcite has been fitted to reproduce the experimental melting point of water and the tip4p / ew@xcite and tip4p/2005@xcite models reproduce the maximum in density at room pressure . among these models ,",
    "we have chosen to use the tip4p/2005 model potential , because it provides a good description of the phase diagram@xcite and also it predicts to good accuracy the density of the solid phases of ice.@xcite in this work , the free energies of two recently discovered solid phases of water , namely ices xiii and xiv,@xcite are computed for the first time .",
    "ice xiii is the proton ordered form of ice v. it has a monoclinic unit cell with 28 molecules .",
    "ice xiv is the proton ordered form of ice xii .",
    "it has a tetragonal unit cell with 12 molecules .",
    "the tip4p/2005 model has been shown to reproduce reasonably well the densities of these two solid forms of ice.@xcite in the simulations performed in this work the lj potential was truncated at 8.5  for both solid phases .",
    "standard long range corrections were added to the lj energy.@xcite ewald sums were used to deal with the long range electrostatic forces .",
    "the real part of the electrostatic contribution was also truncated at 8.5   .",
    "the screening parameter and the number of vectors of reciprocal space considered had to be carefully selected for each crystal phase.@xcite      we also computed the free energy of a patchy model , which has been previously used as a simplified model of globular proteins.@xcite this model consists of a repulsive core with some attractive sites ( patches ) on its surface .",
    "in particular , we studied model particles with six patches in an octahedral arrangement .",
    "the repulsive core is modelled by the lj repulsive core , while the attractive term is described by the lj tail modulated by gaussian functions centred at the positions of each patch .",
    "therefore , the total energy between two particles is described by the following function : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lennard - jones potential , @xmath15 is the standard deviation of the gaussian , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the angle formed between patch @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) on atom @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and the interparticle vector @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the patch that minimises the magnitude of this angle .",
    "additionally , for computational efficiency , the potential is truncated and shifted using a cutoff distance of @xmath24 .",
    "using reduced units ( i.e. , choosing the unit of energy and length as the values of the lj parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , the only parameter that needs to be specified is the width of the patches @xmath27 . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath28 rad .",
    ", as for this value the whole phase diagram has already been studied.@xcite in this previous study , it has been shown that there are several solid phases that are thermodynamically stable , namely , simple cubic ( sc ) , body - centred cubic ( bcc ) , face - centred cubic ( fcc ) and , at high temperatures , a plastic fcc crystal . in this work",
    ", we will compute the free energy of the three orientationally ordered structures ( sc , bcc , and fcc ) for several system sizes .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the einstein molecule approach is a variant of the einstein crystal method of frenkel - ladd@xcite that has been proposed quite recently.@xcite analogously to the frenkel - ladd method , the free energy is computed by integration to a reference system whose free energy can be computed analytically .",
    "the difference is that in the einstein molecule approach the reference system is not an ideal einstein crystal , but an ideal einstein molecule .",
    "the einstein molecule is defined as an einstein crystal in which one of the particles does not vibrate .",
    "the name of einstein molecule has been chosen by analogy with molecules , where it is common to use one of the atoms to define the position of a molecule , and the vibrational movement of the remaining atoms is given relative to this reference atom .",
    "the einstein molecule approach has been successfully applied to compute the free energy of simple atomic systems ( hs and lj),@xcite but we will see that it can be easily extended to molecular solids .",
    "we will start by writing the partition function of a molecular system in the canonical ensemble : @xmath29d{\\bf r}_1 d\\omega_1 ...",
    "d{\\bf r}_n d\\omega_n \\label{eq_pf}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the position of the reference point of molecule @xmath5 in cartesian coordinates , and @xmath31 stands for a set of normalised angles ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) defining the orientation of particle @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the rotational , vibrational , and electronic partition functions , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the thermal de broglie wavelength ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "there is some freedom in choosing the reference point of the molecule .",
    "it can be chosen as the center of mass or , alternatively , this reference point can be chosen so that all elements of symmetry pass through it ( for a more detailed discussion see ref . ) .",
    "we have chosen the reference point to be at the center of the sphere for the octahedral patchy model and for spheric particles , at the center of mass for hard - dumbbells and at the oxygen atom for water .",
    "the intermolecular potential @xmath39 depends only on the relative distance between the molecules , not on their absolute positions , i.e. , it is invariant under translations .",
    "this invariance of the system can be used to write the partition function in a more convenient way by performing a change of variables from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , equation [ eq_pf ] can be written : @xmath42   d\\omega_1 d{\\bf r}'_2 d\\omega_2 ... d{\\bf r}'_n d\\omega_n   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{q'^{n}}{n ! \\lambda^{3n } } \\int d{\\bf r}_1 \\",
    ", \\kappa \\label{eq_inte}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral @xmath43 does not depend on the position of particle 1 , @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the integration over @xmath44 can readily be performed : @xmath45 for a system of @xmath2 indistinguishable particles and for a given position of particle 1 there are @xmath46 possible permutations of the remaining @xmath47 particles .",
    "the term @xmath43 can be evaluated by computing the integral for a given permutation of the particles ( @xmath48 ) and multiplying it by the number of permutations , so that the partition function can be written as : @xmath49 we will assume that @xmath50 has the same value in the two coexisting phases , so that its value does not affect the coexistence point . for simplicity , in what follows , we will assign @xmath50 the value unity .",
    "we will extend now the definition of the ideal einstein molecule to molecular solids . for atomic solids ,",
    "an ideal einstein molecule was defined as an ideal einstein crystal in which one of the particles does not vibrate and acts as reference . for molecular solids ,",
    "the ideal einstein molecule is defined as an ideal einstein crystal in which the reference point of particle 1 is fixed , but rotations of the molecule about this point are allowed .",
    "the reference point of particle 1 is called the carrier , because it transports the lattice , i.e. , the position of the lattice is uniquely defined by the position of the reference point of particle 1 .",
    "the lattice can move as a whole over the volume of the simulation box , and its position is defined by the position of the reference point of particle 1 .",
    "the potential energy of the ideal einstein molecule is given by : @xmath51 \\\\ u_{ein , or } & = & \\sum ^{n}_{i=1 } u_{ein , or } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the position of the reference point of molecule @xmath5 in the reference einstein solid , while @xmath53 represents its position in the current configuration .",
    "as can be seen in eq.[ete_einstein_molecule ] , all the particles except particle 1 ( which is fixed ) are attached to their lattice positions by harmonic springs .",
    "an orientational field ( @xmath54 ) that forces the particles to adopt the right orientation is also included ( this field acts over all the particles of the system , including particle 1 ) .",
    "the orientational field depends on the symmetry of the particles and , thus , an orientational field must be defined for each model potential . the orientational field used for each one of the model potentials that have been studied in this work",
    "will be given in section [ orient ] .",
    "the partition function of the ideal einstein molecule can be obtained by performing the integral @xmath48 for this particular case : @xmath55 d{\\bf r } \\right]^{(n-1 ) }   \\left [ \\int \\exp{(-\\beta u_{ein , or } ) } d\\omega \\right]^n = \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{\\beta \\lambda_e } \\right)^{3(n-1)/2 }   q_{ein , or } \\label{kprima}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the orientational partition function , which is usually evaluated numerically ( more details are given the section [ orient ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the ideal einstein molecule can be obtained by replacing the partition function given by eq .",
    "[ kprima ] in eq .",
    "[ eq_general_partition ] : @xmath57 + \\left [ -\\frac{1}{n } ln ( q_{ein , or } ) \\right ] \\label{eq_free_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the numeric value of the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath58 is irrelevant to compute the coexistence point as long as the same value is used for both coexisting phases .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to assign @xmath58 the value of the characteristic length for each model potential .",
    "thus , for hs @xmath59 , for hd @xmath59 , for lj @xmath60 , for water @xmath61  and for the patchy model @xmath62 .    in the einstein molecule approach ,",
    "the free energy of a given solid is estimated by designing a path from the ideal einstein molecule ( whose free energy can be computed by eq .",
    "[ eq_free_energy ] ) to the real solid .",
    "this path can be divided into three steps ( see figure [ fig_esquema ] ) . in the first step , the ideal einstein molecule or ,",
    "what is the same , the position of the reference point of the carrier ( molecule 1 ) is constrained to a given position . in the second step ,",
    "the ideal einstein molecule with fixed molecule 1 is transformed into the real solid with fixed molecule 1 .",
    "finally , in the last step , the solid of interest is recovered by removing the constraint over the position of molecule 1 . the free energy change that results from the transformation in the first step",
    "is given by a term @xmath63 , while the third step contributes by a term @xmath64 .",
    "the term @xmath65 comes from the constraint on the position of molecule 1 , and the term @xmath66 comes from the constraint on the momentum .",
    "therefore , the contributions to the final free energy of steps one and three cancel out and all what is needed is to compute the free energy change between an ideal einstein molecule and the real solid , both with the position ( but not the orientation ) of particle 1 fixed .",
    "this free energy change will be computed in two stages . in the first stage",
    "we will evaluate the free energy change between the ideal einstein molecule ( there is no interaction between the particles , only the external einstein crystal field is present ) and the interacting einstein molecule ( in which both the springs and the intermolecular potential are present ) , both with the position of particle 1 fixed , by a perturbative approach:@xcite @xmath67\\right>_{ein - mol - id}.\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the potential energy of the real solid and @xmath69 is the potential energy of the frozen lattice ( see ref . for a more detailed discussion ) . the brackets with the subscript @xmath70 indicate that the average is performed by sampling the configurations in a system where only the einstein field is present . in the second stage , the interacting einstein molecule with fixed molecule 1 is transformed into the real solid with fixed molecule 1 , by slowly turning off the springs , according to the following expression : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a parameter that takes values between 0 and 1 .",
    "the free energy change corresponding to this transformation can be estimated by numerically evaluating the following integral : @xmath73 this integral is usually performed by using a gauss - legendre quadrature formula .",
    "for that purpose , the integrand of this expression must be evaluated at several values of @xmath74 , which can be done by performing @xmath75 mc simulations for those values of the coupling parameter .",
    "taking all the contributions together , the free energy of solid can be computed as : @xmath76 which is the central result of this work .",
    "an alternative proof of the einstein molecule approach can be found in the appendix .",
    "we show that the einstein molecule method can be obtained as the limit case of the einstein crystal method when the mass of molecule 1 is much larger than the mass of the remaining molecules .",
    "we have said before that the orientational field must be chosen so that it has the same symmetry as the molecules . in this section , the orientational fields used for each of the studied model potentials are given .",
    "in particular , for hard - dumbbells ( @xmath77 symmetry ) , we have chosen the orientational field:@xcite @xmath78.\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the angle formed between the axis of particle @xmath5 and the equilibrium position of the axis of particle @xmath5 in the cp1 hd solid . in this case",

    "the water molecule exhibits @xmath84 symmetry and , therefore , a convenient choice of the orientational field is:@xcite @xmath85.\\ ] ] in this case , the orientation of the molecule is defined by two unitary vectors , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . these vectors are obtained as the subtraction ( @xmath86 ) and the addition ( @xmath87 ) of the two hydrogen vectors given relative to the position of the oxygen atom .",
    "the angle @xmath88 is the angle formed by the vector @xmath86 of molecule @xmath5 in a given configuration ( @xmath89 ) and the vector @xmath86 in the reference configuration ( @xmath90 ) of the external einstein field .",
    "@xmath79 is defined analogously but with vector @xmath87 ( for further details see ref . ) .",
    "the orientational partition function can be computed as : @xmath91^n\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath92 are the euler angles that define the orientation of the molecule .",
    "this integral can be simplified by choosing the vector @xmath93 as the @xmath94 axis , so that the euler angle @xmath95 is identical to the vector @xmath96 .",
    "it can be evaluated numerically by using a monte carlo integration method .",
    "the efficiency of the monte carlo integration method can be considerably improved by realizing that , for large values of @xmath97 , the exponential decays very rapidly to zero as the angle @xmath95 increases , i.e. , as the particle rotates away from the reference orientation .",
    "therefore , much efficiency is gained by sampling only small values of @xmath95 .",
    "we have chosen to sample cos@xmath81 and only those angles for which the cosine is between 0.99 and 1 have been considered .",
    "about @xmath98 mc cycles were used to evaluate this integral . in a previous paper",
    ", it has been shown that some approximations can be made to this integral for large values of the coupling parameter.@xcite we have found that , for a coupling parameter @xmath9925000 , the approximation gives a value for the free energy of the orientational field , @xmath100 , about 0.04 lower than that obtained by performing the exact integral using the monte carlo integral method . in particular , using the exact integral we obtained that @xmath101 , while using the approximate formula , we obtained that @xmath102 .",
    "although this difference is not too large , we recommend to use the exact expression of the integral , using a numerical algorithm to evaluate it .    as with regard to the patchy model with octahedral symmetry ( point group @xmath103 ) , the orientational field was:@xcite @xmath104.\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the minimum angle formed by any of the vectors that define the position of the patches in the particle s reference system with respect to the @xmath106 axis of a fixed reference system and @xmath107 is the analogous quantity with respect to the @xmath108 axis , where the fixed reference system has been chosen to be coincident with the orientation of the patches in the perfect lattice .",
    "therefore , the orientational partition function is given by : @xmath109^n\\ ] ] in this case , the integral was evaluated numerically using the monte carlo integration method and using at least @xmath110 points .",
    "in all the cases , we have chosen that both the translational and orientational field have the same numeric value of the coupling parameter @xmath111 .",
    "note , however , that the coupling parameter of the translational field , @xmath112 has units of energy over a squared length , whereas the orientational coupling parameters @xmath113 and @xmath97 have dimensions of energy .    once the orientational field has been chosen , we can write the explicit form for the integral @xmath114 .",
    "for example , for water : @xmath115 \\right>_{n , v , t,\\lambda^ { ' } } d\\lambda'\\ ] ] where the brackets with the subscript @xmath116 means an average over a simulation of a system where both an ideal einstein field with coupling parameter @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 ) and the solid potential are present ( i.e. , the total potential is @xmath119 ) . for convenience , we will split this expression in two terms , one that accounts for the translational contribution ( @xmath120 ) and other that accounts for the orientational contribution ( @xmath121 ) : @xmath122 @xmath123 \\right>_{n , v , t,\\lambda^ { ' } } d\\lambda ' \\label{eq_a2or}\\ ] ]      it is well known that the free energy of solids exhibits a strong size dependence.@xcite in a recent paper , we have made an attempt to propose some recipes to correct for this strong size dependence in a simple way . in what follows ,",
    "we briefly review those fsc ( a more detailed discussion was already given in ref .  ) .",
    "the two first proposed fsc , namely , the frenkel - ladd fsc ( fsc - fl ) and the hard - spheres fsc ( fsc - hs ) consist of simply adding a term to the free energy of a system of @xmath2 particles to obtain an approximation to the free energy in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath124 @xmath125 these are empiric corrections that have been shown to improve the results for the hs fcc solid .",
    "also we have noted that the term @xmath126 is approximately equal to the term @xmath127 except for very small values of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we decided to explore also the performance of this fsc : @xmath128    in a second family of fsc which was designated as fsc - asymptotic , the free energy in the thermodynamic limit is estimated by taking the limit when @xmath2 tends to infinity in the analytical expression of the free energy of the ideal einstein molecule ( eq . [ eq_free_energy ] ) .",
    "three different variants of the fsc - asymptotic were proposed differing on whether a further approximation to the term @xmath114 was also made . in the first variant ( @xmath129 ) , no approximation was made to @xmath114 : @xmath130 in a second variant , an approximation to @xmath114 is made based on the assumption that all the @xmath47 oscillators contribute by the same amount to the integral .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for atomic solids ( for a fcc hs solid with n=108 particles , we obtained that all the atoms except the first nearest neighbours contributed approximately by the same amount ; the contribution of the nearest neighbours is about a 10% lower than the contribution of the remaining atoms ) . for molecular solids ,",
    "it is important to notice that there are two contributions to @xmath114 , one translational and one orientational .",
    "as pointed out before , the einstein molecule only imposes the constraint on the position of particle 1 , but not on its orientation .",
    "therefore , assuming that all the molecules contribute by the same amount to the translational integral , @xmath114 can be approximated by the following expression : @xmath131 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given in eq .",
    "[ eq_a2 t ] and [ eq_a2or ] , and @xmath132 is the contribution to the translational integral of one single arbitrary particle ( under the assumption that all the particles contribute by the same amount ) .",
    "we shall assume now that the orientational contribution is independent of the system size and that the asymptotic value of @xmath133 is @xmath132 .",
    "in the fsc - as2 , @xmath114 is approximated as : @xmath134 therefore , the fsc - as2 for molecular solids must be slightly modified with respect to that obtained for atomic solids ( compare with eq .",

    "): @xmath135 finally , the last variant is obtained as the mean value of the fsc - as1 and fsc - as2 : @xmath136 notice that in these expressions @xmath137 and @xmath114 were obtained by the einstein molecule approach .",
    "before presenting the results of the free energy calculations with the einstein molecule approach , we will show that fixing one molecule in a solid ( in the absence of the einstein field ) does not affect the structural properties ( due to the translational invariance ) .",
    "for that purpose , we computed the radial distribution function in a nvt simulation for an atomic system , the hs fcc solid , and the site - site radial distribution function for a molecular system , the hard - dumbbells cp1 solid .",
    "we will determine the structure both when one particle is fixed and when all the particles are allowed to move .",
    "for the hs fcc solid , we considered a simulation box with @xmath138108 particles , so that the possible existence of an inhomogeneity would result in an appreciable change in the radial distribution function .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fdr ] ( a ) , the radial distribution function is identical regardless of whether one particle is fixed or not . as with regard to the hard - dumbbells",
    "cp1 solid , we considered a simulation box with only @xmath13832 particles . in this case the center of mass of molecule 1 was fixed but molecule 1 was allowed to rotate .",
    "our results show that the site - site radial distribution function is again identical for a system where all the particles are allowed to move and for a system where the center of mass of one of the particles is fixed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_fdr ] ( b ) ) .",
    "note that it is important that the dumbbell with fixed center of mass is allowed to rotate .",
    "if molecule 1 is frozen at a given orientation , the remaining molecules of the solid will not see all the possible orientations of molecule 1 . therefore ,",
    "all the possible orientations of the fixed molecule are not sampled and the fixed particle will introduce an inhomogeneity in the system .",
    "we checked that this is indeed true by computing also the site - site radial distribution function for a system where one particle is not allowed to translate and is not allowed to rotate . in this case , it is observed that the value of the site - site radial distribution function at contact is affected by the constraint on the orientation of the carrier molecule .",
    "in particular , we obtained that the value at contact is 5.072 when all the molecules are free to move , which is equal ( within statistical error ) to the value at contact when the position of molecule 1 is fixed but it is allowed to rotate , 5.070 .",
    "however , when molecule 1 is not allowed to translate nor to rotate , the contact value of the radial distribution is somewhat lower ( 5.014 ) , which means that the constraint on the orientation introduces an inhomogeneity in the solid .",
    "the validity of the einstein molecule approach for molecular solids was checked by comparing the free energies of different molecular solids with those obtained using the frenkel - ladd einstein crystal method ( as implemented by polson _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ) . at this stage , as the purpose was to show that both methods lead to exactly the same results , we performed unusually long simulations in order to reduce the statistical error . in",
    "what follows , we describe the simulation details for each model .    for the hd cp1 solid",
    ", we calculated the free energy for a system with @xmath138144 ( @xmath139 unit cells ) at a number density @xmath140 , where @xmath7 is the diameter of each one of the hard - spheres of a hard - dumbbell .",
    "as the solid is not cubic , we first performed a parrinello - rahman@xcite npt mc simulation consisting of @xmath141 mc cycles for equilibration plus another @xmath141 mc cycles for taking averages ( a mc cycle is defined as @xmath2 attempts to translate or rotate a particle plus one attempt to change the the matrix that defines the simulation box ) . in agreement with previous calculations ,",
    "the parrinello - rahman npt simulations show that the ratio between the two edges of the unit cell ( @xmath142 ) is slightly different from that at close - packing .",
    "besides the changes in the shape of the simulation box it is observed that the orientation of the hard - dumbbells is also different from that at close - packing .",
    "they change from @xmath143 to @xmath144 and from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "this has already been noted by vega _ _ et al.__@xcite once we have obtained the equilibrium configuration at @xmath147 , the free energy was calculated by using 16 points to evaluate the integral @xmath114 by the gauss - legendre quadrature formula . at each point , the integrand of @xmath114 was evaluated by performing a nvt mc simulation consisting of @xmath148 mc cycles for equilibration and @xmath149 mc cycles for taking averages at each value of the coupling parameter .",

    "the simulation box contained @xmath160 unit cells ( 504 molecules ) in the case of ice xiii and @xmath161 unit cells ( 540 molecules ) for ice xiv .",
    "as mentioned before , neither of these solid phases has cubic symmetry .",
    "ice xiii has a monoclinic unit cell and ice xiv has an orthorhombic unit cell . therefore , previously to the computation of the free energy , the solid structure was relaxed to the equilibrium . for ice xiii",

    "only the length of the edges of the box were allowed to fluctuate in the simulations , while the angles were kept fixed . in this case",
    ", it was obtained that , at this thermodynamic state , the length of the edges of the simulation box at equilibrium are @xmath169  , @xmath170  and @xmath171  .",
    "once that the equilibrium shape of the simulation box was obtained , the positions and orientations of the molecules ( i.e , the positions of the oxygens and hydrogens ) in the reference structure were taken from the crystallographic data provided by salzmann _",

    "16 points were used to evaluate the term @xmath114 and , at each of these points , a simulation consisting of @xmath141 mc cycles ( @xmath175 cycles for equilibration ) was carried out , while the term @xmath137 was obtained from a simulation consisting of @xmath156 mc cycles ( @xmath148 for equilibration ) .    the results of the free energies for these systems , as calculated using the einstein crystal method and the einstein molecule approach are shown in tables [ tbl_test ] and [ tbl_ice_test ] .",
    "in addition to the total free energy , the value of the different terms that contribute to the free energy in both methods are also shown .",
    "it can be seen that both methods give the same value of the free energy within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "although the contribution of the different terms that contribute to the free energy is not the same when the center of mass is fixed or when molecule 1 is fixed , their sum is invariant .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference between @xmath176 and @xmath177 is about @xmath126 ( see discussion in ref . ) .",
    "therefore , our results show that , indeed , the einstein molecule approach is a valid route to compute the free energy of molecular solids .      as this is the first time that the free energies of ices xiii and xiv are given , we decided to perform more extensive calculations in this case .",
    "the effect of the shape of the simulation box on the free energy was also studied .",
    "moreover , as mentioned before , it is not obvious what orientation of the water molecules should be chosen in the reference structure .",
    "for that reason , we decided to explore some of the possible orientations to see whether this choice affects the results of the free energy calculations .",
    "the results presented in this section have been obtained from shorter simulations than those of the previous section .",
    "typically each simulation consisted of @xmath178 mc cycles ( @xmath179 for equilibration ) .",
    "this is usually enough to obtain a reasonable accuracy .",
    "first we calculated the free energy of both phases using the einstein molecule approach in three different thermodynamic states , namely , p=1bar and t=80k , p=1bar and t=250k and p=5000bar and t=80k , so that there are two points along one isobar and two points along one isotherm .",
    "the values of the free energies at those thermodynamic states are shown in table [ free_energy_ices ] .",
    "these data will serve us to check that our calculations are thermodynamically consistent , i.e. , that the results of the free energy calculations are the same as those obtained by thermodynamic integration of the equation of state . for ice xiii , through free energy calculations , we obtained @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 . starting from @xmath183 and performing thermodynamic integration along this isotherm",
    "we obtained that @xmath184 .",
    "the integration along the isobar starting from @xmath183 yields @xmath185 .",
    "both estimations are in agreement with the results obtained by means of free energy calculations . a good agreement was also obtained for ice xiv . in this case , the free energy calculations provide @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",
    "starting from @xmath183 and integrating along the isotherm 80k , we obtained that @xmath189 , and integrating along the isobar 1bar , it is obtained that @xmath190 , again in good agreement with the results of free energy calculations .",
    "once we have confidence on the reliability of our calculations , we studied the effect of the shape of the simulation box on the free energy . for that purpose , for ice xiv ,",
    "the free energy was also computed for a simulation box that has been deformed from the equilibrium shape at t=80k and p=1 bar .",
    "the length of the edges at equilibrium @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , were deformed to @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , so that the density remains invariant under this change of the simulation box .",
    "our results show that the free energy increases when the shape of the simulation box does not correspond to that at equilibrium .",
    "in particular , when a deformation defined by @xmath197 is applied , the free energy increases from its value at equilibrium @xmath198 to @xmath199 .",
    "an increase is also found when the edges are scaled with @xmath200 , for which it was found that @xmath201 .",
    "this is the expected result , as the equilibrium structure corresponds to a minimum of free energy , and any perturbation will result in an increase of the free energy .",
    "these results evidence the importance of obtaining the equilibrium structure previously to the computation of the free energy .",
    "otherwise , we would be overestimating the value of the free energy .",
    "as mentioned before , the positions of the oxygens and hydrogens ( i.e. , the position and orientation of the water molecules ) in the reference structure to be used for the einstein field were taken from the experimental values ( for ices xiii and xiv both the oxygen and hydrogens are ordered )",
    ". however , the experimental equilibrium positions and orientations of the molecules will not be exactly equal to those of the potential model used in the simulations .",
    "moreover , it is possible that one would want to study some solid for which there are no experimental data available .",
    "this does not pose a problem , because , in principle , the free energy should not depend on the precise location of the external field provided that the field reflects the structure of the system .",
    "however , we wanted to check that this was indeed true and we computed the free energy using another reference structure .",
    "in particular , we now used a reference structure in which the water molecules are oriented as to minimise the potential energy .",
    "this structure was obtained by simulated annealing .",
    "starting from a configuration in which the simulation box corresponds to the equilibrium ( as obtained from the npt simulation ) and where the water molecules have the same positions and orientation as those found in experiments , we performed a quenching from 80k to 1k , using 6 intermediate temperatures , and keeping the shape of the simulation box constant along the whole simulation . at each one of the temperatures ,",
    "the system was allowed to evolve during @xmath202 mc cycles . to avoid translations of the system as a whole",
    ", we fixed the reference point ( but not the orientation ) of molecule 1 in the annealing .",
    "the structure obtained from the annealing should be close to the minimum in the potential energy ( the minimum energy structure would be obtained at 0k , at 1k the structure is likely to be not yet at the minimum@xcite ) . using the structures",
    "obtained from simulated annealing , we calculated again the free energies of ices xiii and xiv ( see table [ free_energy_ices ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the free energy is independent of the reference structure . as expected , the terms @xmath137 and @xmath114 take different values depending on which reference structure has been chosen . however , their sum is independent of the reference structure .",
    "the term @xmath137 is close to the lattice energy and , therefore , it is obvious that its value will depend on the reference structure . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath114 is the integral from the real solid to the einstein molecule with intermolecular interactions . in this case",
    ", the fact of changing the reference structure means that the integral is performed from a new starting point , which results on a different value of the integral @xmath114 .",
    "however , our results show that the changes in @xmath137 and @xmath114 cancel out and , therefore , the same value of the free energy is obtained regardless of which reference structure has been used .",
    "finally we also evaluated the free energy for a reference structure in which the atoms are located at their average positions and orientations at that thermodynamic state ( these were obtained by averaging over 500 snapshots and readjusting the positions of the hydrogens to obtain the bond and angle distances of the tip4p/2005 model for each molecule ) , and again the same value of the free energy ( within statistical error ) is obtained .",
    "obviously , it is desirable that the reference structure is close to the equilibrium structure , otherwise larger values of the coupling parameter would be needed and this will result in a higher statistical error in the evaluation of @xmath114 .    taking into account all these considerations ,",
    "the procedure to compute the free energy is schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig_esquema_emol ] .",
    "it is important that , previously to the computation of the free energy , an appropriate reference structure is obtained .    before leaving this section and",
    "because this is the first time that the free energy of ices xiii and xiv has been computed , we would like to briefly discuss the relative stability of these two ice polymorphs .",
    "for that purpose , we computed the chemical potential [ @xmath203 along the isobars p=1bar and p=5000bar by thermodynamic integration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_coex_ice ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that , at @xmath2045000bar ice xiv is more stable than ice xiii at all temperatures , i.e. , from low temperatures up to melting temperatures . on the contrary , at p=1bar",
    ", ice xiv is slightly more stable than ice xiii at low temperatures , but at temperatures close to melting ice xiii seems to be slightly more stable than ice xiv .",
    "the phase transition seems to occur around @xmath205 . in any case , it is important to note that ice @xmath206 is the most stable phase at @xmath158 bar for the tip4p/2005 model.@xcite      finally we also studied the size dependence of the free energy of molecular solids by analysing the size behaviour of three different solid structures ( sc , bcc , and fcc ) for the octahedral patchy model .",
    "the free energies of those solid structures as obtained in this work using the einstein molecule approach for several values of @xmath2 are given in table [ tbl_patchy ] .",
    "results for the lj fcc solid at @xmath207 and @xmath208 are also given in table [ tbl_lj ] .",
    "in these calculations , the lj potential was truncated at a cutoff distance of 2.7@xmath15 and long range corrections were used ( obtained assuming @xmath209 beyond the cutoff ) .",
    "our results show that for all the studied solid structures the free energy exhibits a strong size dependence , as found in previous studies.@xcite it is interesting to note that the slope of the plot @xmath210 versus @xmath1 is different depending on the solid structure , even for the same model potential . for the patchy model",
    ", we obtained that the slope is about -14 for the sc structure , about -8 for the bcc and about -12 for the fcc .",
    "this means that , in order to accurately calculate the phase diagram of a given substance , a study of the system size dependence must be performed for each considered solid structure , which implies a large number of simulations",
    ". therefore it would be useful to have a simple recipe to correct for the system size dependence as this could save a large amount of computational time .",
    "the performance of the fsc was studied for all the considered solid structures of the octahedral anisotropic model . in tables [ tbl_patchy ] and [ tbl_lj ] , all the contributions to the free energy are explicitly given , as this will allow us to identify the terms that exhibit a stronger dependence with the system size . the free energy obtained by applying the proposed fsc to the free energy at a given @xmath2 for all the considered solid structures of the octahedral patchy model are given in table [ tbl_fsc ] and in figure [ fig_patchy ] .",
    "results of applying the fsc to the calculated free energies of the fcc lj solid are also given in table [ tbl_fsc ] .",
    "it can be seen that all the proposed recipes for finite size corrections give a value of the free energy closer to the thermodynamic limit than the estimate obtained from the value of the free energy for a certain @xmath2 .",
    "the fsc - hs , which was based on the slope of the free energy as a function of @xmath1 for hs , obviously works better when the slope is similar to the slope of hs ( around -7 ) .",
    "the same is true for the fsc - hs2 .",
    "therefore , at a given size , the prediction of the value of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit for the sc and fcc structures for the patchy model , whose slopes were -14 and -12 , respectively , is not very accurate .",
    "the performance of the fsc - fl is also not satisfactory .",
    "although it also seems to give quite good results in some cases ( e.g. , for the bcc solid in the patchy model ) , there are other solids for which they correct only partially for the system size dependence . finally , the fsc - asymptotic in its three variants seem to give quite accurate results for all the cases studied .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the size dependence of the terms that contribute to the free energy ( see tables [ tbl_patchy ] and [ tbl_lj ] ) .",
    "it can be observed that the terms @xmath137 and the orientational contribution to @xmath114 ( @xmath121 ) are almost independent of the system size .",
    "all the size dependence comes from the free energy of the reference system ( as given by eq .",
    "[ eq_free_energy ] ) and , to a much lesser extent , from the translational contribution to the integral @xmath114 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "therefore , by simply taking the limit when @xmath211 in this analytical expression ( eq . [ eq_free_energy ] ) , the free energy at a given @xmath2 can be substantially corrected .",
    "we also calculated the deviation from the correct value ( i.e. , the free energy in the thermodynamic limit ) for all the proposed fsc ( see table [ tbl_fsc_all ] ) .",
    "data for the hs fcc solid at three different thermodynamic states taken from a previous work@xcite are also included in table [ tbl_fsc_all ] .",
    "the deviation from the correct value ( @xmath212 ) was computed for the lowest system size studied in each case .",
    "the mean deviation of each fsc computed as @xmath213 is also given .",
    "it can be seen that both the fsc - as1 and the fsc - as3 exhibit the best performance , obtaining a mean deviation from the correct value of 7 or 8 ( in @xmath214 units ) .",
    "the deviation of the rest of the fsc is not as good , but still the mean deviation is typically around 14 , which is substantially lower than the mean deviation obtained from the true value of the free energy at small values of @xmath2 ( around 55 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the einstein molecule approach to the computation of the free energy of molecular solids .",
    "the method has been tested using a variety of model potentials , which include hard - dumbbells , the tip4p/2005 water model and a simple anisotropic model consisting of a spherical repulsive core with some attractive sites .",
    "our results show that both the einstein crystal method of frenkel and ladd ( as corrected by polson _ _ et al.__@xcite ) and the einstein molecule approach of vega and noya give the same results of the free energy within statistical accuracy .",
    "once the einstein molecule approach was tested , this method was used to compute the free energies of ices xiii and xiv for first time .",
    "the free energy was computed at three different thermodynamic states , which allowed us to test our free energy calculations by performing thermodynamic consistency checks .",
    "in addition , we have stressed the importance of using the equilibrium shape of the simulation box in the computation of the free energy .",
    "our results show that any deformation from this equilibrium structure invariably leads to an increase of the free energy .",
    "this is the expected behaviour , as the equilibrium structure is that that minimises the free energy .",
    "any deformation introduces stress in the system that leads to an increase of the free energy .",
    "therefore , for solids with non - cubic symmetry , it is important to perform a parrinello - rahman npt simulation to obtain the equilibrium shape of the simulation box previously to the computation of the free energy .",
    "moreover , we studied the effect that the choice of the reference einstein field has on the calculation of free energies . in complex solids , such as , for example , ices xiii and xiv , there is not an obvious choice of how the water molecules should be oriented in the reference structure , as both solids exhibit a complex unit cell with a large number of water molecules and in which not all the molecules exhibit the same orientation .",
    "we have performed calculations of the free energy of both solid phases using a reference structure where the positions and orientations of the molecules were taken from experimental data and using a reference structure that has been obtained by simulated annealing , i.e. , using a reference structure that minimises the potential energy ( for the equilibrium shape of the simulation box ) .",
    "our results show that , even though the two choices lead to different values of @xmath137 and @xmath114 , the addition of both terms is independent of the choice of the reference structure . this is the expected result , because we are computing the free energy of the same solid , but using a difference reference system ( i.e. , the position and orientation of the field are slightly different ) .",
    "obviously it is desirable to use a reference structure that is close to the minimum , otherwise larger values of the coupling parameter will be needed and this will result in a larger error in the evaluation of @xmath114 .",
    "this is an important result , because , in many cases , one will be interested in real solids with complex structures and the choice of a reference structure will be a subtle issue .",
    "however , our results show that it is not necessary to obtain the structure that minimises the potential energy , as far as the reference structure is not too far from this minimum .",
    "finally , we have also studied the size dependence of the free energy for a simple anisotropic model .",
    "our results show that all the studied solid phases , namely , sc , bcc , and fcc , exhibit a strong size dependence , although the slope of the plot of a versus 1/n is different for each solid phase . in a previous work we also found that the free energy of the fcc hs solid depends slightly on the density.@xcite",
    "this means that there is a complex dependence of the free energy with the system size , which depends not only on the model potential , but also on the thermodynamic state and on the solid structure .",
    "this result seems to suggest that it might be difficult to obtain a simple recipe that would allow us to obtain the free energy in the thermodynamic limit from the calculated value at a finite size @xmath2 . in any case , we tested all the previously proposed fsc and we found that the asymptotic fsc - as1 and fsc - as3 manage to give quite accurate estimates of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit for all the solids studied so far .",
