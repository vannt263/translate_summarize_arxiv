    "the heisenberg s uncertainty principle provides a basic limitation of measuring the classical trajectories in the atomic or sub - atomic scale . but here , there is no absolute minimum or maximum uncertainty in the position and momentum themselves , though there is `` conditional '' minimum in them when one of them is fixed .",
    "so , in this regards , there have been arguments that the heisenberg s uncertainty principle needs some modifications when the gravitational interaction is considered in quantum mechanics since there is an absolute minimum uncertainty in the position of any gravitating quantum wign:57,amat:89 . and",
    "also , its several interesting implications have been studied in the literatures .",
    "especially , it has been found that the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) increases the hawking temperature , resulting in `` faster '' decay of schwarzschild black holes in any dimension adle:01,cava:04 .",
    "however , the gup does not have any limitation on the maximum uncertainty in the position such as it can not be naively applied to the case with the large ( cut - off ) length scales , like as in de sitter or anti - de sitter space .",
    "actually , the hawking temperature of black holes in ( anti ) de sitter space can not be reproduced by the heisenberg s uncertainty principle or the gup .",
    "recently , an _ extended _ uncertainty principle ( i will call this `` eup '' , simply ) has been introduced to incorporate the existence of the large length scales and it is found that the hawking temperatures of the schwarzshild-(anti ) de sitter black holes have been correctly reproduced bole:05 .    in this paper , i generalize the eup to the case with an absolute minimum uncertainty in the position as well and compute its modification to the hawking temperature .",
    "i obtain a _ general _",
    "trend that the generalized uncertainty principle due to the absolute minimum length always increases the hawking temperature , implying faster decay , which is in conformity with the result of the asymptotically flat space .",
    "i also revisit the black hole - string phase transition , in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle .",
    "in this section , i review , with some new interpretations and remarks , the gup and the derivation of hawking temperature from the uncertainty principle in the asymptotically flat space adle:01,cava:04 .",
    "the gup is given by    [ gup ] x_i p_j _ ij ,    where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the spatial coordinates and momenta , respectively ; @xmath2 is the planck length and @xmath3 is a dimensionless real constant of order one wign:57 . in the absence of the second term in the right hand side",
    ", this reduces to the usual heisenberg s uncertainty principle without any `` absolute '' bound of @xmath4 nor @xmath5 themselves .",
    "but , in the presence of the second term , there exists an absolute minimum in the position uncertainty    x_i 2 l_p    and the uncertainty in the momentum is given by    [ p : flat ] x_i2 ^2 l_p^2 p_i",
    "x_i2 ^2 l_p^2 .",
    "the left inequality in ( [ p : flat ] ) provides some small corrections to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle for @xmath6 ( i.e. , semi - classical regime ) ,    [ p : flat(series ) ] p_i x_i + ^2 l_p^2(x_i)^3 + o ( ^4 l_p^4(x_i)^5 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the right inequality implies that @xmath7 can not be arbitrarily large in order that the correction in ( [ gup ] ) makes sense .",
    "of course , this upper bound can be higher with the higher order terms in the right hand side of the gup ( [ gup ] ) , but the absolute minimum in @xmath4 can be also lowered or even disappeared , depending on the parameters ko:06 .",
    "another more interesting interpretation would be that the upper bound corresponds to the limit where the quantum gravity effects are very strong such as a _ black hole - string _ phase transition can occur suss:93 .",
    "actually , the inequality can be written also as    p_i x_i ^2 l_p^2 ,    which can be directly derived also from the high momentum uncertainty @xmath5 limit in ( [ gup ] ) , and it is saturated by the linear relation @xmath8 , which coincides with that of strings at the high energy limit , by identifying the string scale @xmath9 amat:89,bole:05 .",
    "now , let me derive the hawking temperature from the uncertainty principle and general properties of black holes . to this end , let me first consider a @xmath10dimensional schwarzshild black hole with a metric given by    [ metric ] ds^2=-n^2 dt^2 + n^-2 dr^3 + r^2 d ^2_d-2 ,    where    n^2= 1 - 16 g m(d-2 ) _",

    "the horizon radius is given by @xmath14^{1/(d-3)}$ ] from the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of the gup effect , the _ precise _ form of the horizon radius @xmath15 is not known unless the gup corrected metric is known , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , i note that the relation ( [ hawking effect ] ) would be generally valid even with the gup effect , with understanding @xmath13 as the gup corrected horizon already",

    "one can obtain the hawking temperature    [ gup : exact(flat ) ] t_gup= ",

    "the `` calibration '' factor ` @xmath19 ' has been introduced in order to have agreements with the usual hawking temperature of the schwarzschild black hole in the leading term , for a large black hole , i.e. , @xmath20 hawk:75,myer:86 :    [ gup : series(flat ) ] t_gup= ( d-34 ) .    before finishing this section ,",
    "i remark first that the formula ( [ hawking effect ] ) , as a result ( [ gup : exact(flat ) ] ) , is still valid even for the small black holes up to the absolute minimum , which is order of planck length @xmath21 , though the series formula ( [ gup : series(flat ) ] ) is valid only for a large @xmath13 .",
    "the black hole evaporation stops at @xmath22 , where the curve ends , and this would correspond to a `` melting '' of the black hole which is followed by the string phase , according to the new interpretation suss:93 .",

    "the gup can not be naively applied to the space with the large length scales like as in ( a)ds space . in this section ,",

    "then , it is easy to see that there is an absolute minimum in the momentum uncertainty    [ eup:2 ] p_i x_i + ^2 x_il^2 2 l.    here , i note that the first inequality is an `` exact '' relation drawn from ( [ eup ] ) , without considering any limit as in ( [ p : flat(series ) ] ) .",
    "now , using the approach in sec .",
    "ii , it is straightforward to see that the hawking temperature of the schwarzshild - ads black holes from the eup ( [ eup:2 ] ) . to this end , let me first consider a @xmath29-dimensional schwarzshild - ads black hole with the metric function    n^2= 1 + r^2l^2_ads-16 g m(d-2 ) _",
    "d-2 r^d-3    in the metric ( [ metric ] ) and a cosmological constant @xmath30 hawk:83 .",
    "then , with the same identifications ( [ hawking effect ] ) and ( [ ep ] ) for the hawking - emitted particles , which do not depends on the large scale behaviors but only on the local structure near the horizon , one can obtain the hawking temperature @xmath31 ,    [ eup : exact ] t_eup(ads)= ( d-34 )    with the same calibration factor ` @xmath19 ' as in the asymptotically flat case , implying its universality , and @xmath32 ; @xmath13 is the radius of the event horizon which solves @xmath33 . here , the existence of the absolute minimum in @xmath7 and so in @xmath34 is a general consequence of the eup of ( [ eup ] ) ( see fig .",

    "so far , i have shown that the eup in ( [ eup ] ) applies to the ads space .",
    "now , the eup for the ds space can be easily constructed by considering @xmath35 in ( [ eup ] ) :    [ eup : ds ] x_i p_j _ ij .",

    "note that the absolute maximum in @xmath4 does not have @xmath37 such as this is a purely classical result .",
    "the hawking temperature of the schwarzshild - ds black hole with a cosmological constant @xmath38 gibb:77 is similarly computed as , by considering @xmath39 in ( [ eup : exact ] ) ,    [ eup : exact(ds ) ] t_eup(ds)= ( d-34 ) .    here ,",
    "the maximum bound reads ( @xmath40 )    [ n : horizon ] r_+ l_ds ,    which is the nariai bound where the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon meet nari:51 .",
    "so , the condition ( [ x : upper ] ) reflects the fact that the uncertainty in the position can not exceed the cosmological horizon , which is the size of the casually connected world in a ds space ( see fig.3 ( thin line ) ) .",
    "in the eup ( [ eup ] ) , there is an absolute minimum in the uncertainty of the momentum . in this section ,",
    "i generalize the eup to have a minimum length scale as well , by combining the gup and the eup , and study the effect of the minimum length to the hawking temperature from the eup , i.e. , the hawking temperature of schwarzshild-(a)ds black holes .    the generalized eup ( @xmath41eup ) is given by    [ geup ] x_i p_j _ ij ,    where i have considered the case of the ads space , first",
    "then , by inverting ( [ geup ] ) , one has the inequalities ,    [ p : geup ] & & p_i^(- ) p_i p_i^(+ ) , + & & p_i^()=x_i2 ^2 l_p^2    and    [ x : geup ] & & x_i^(- ) x_i x_i^(+ ) , + & & x_i^()=l^2 p_i2 ^2 .    here , one finds that there are , now , both the absolute minimum in @xmath4 and @xmath7    [ x : lower : ads ] & & ( x_i)^2 4 ^2 l_p^21 - 4 ^2 l_p^2 ^2/l^2  , + & & ( p_i)^2 4 ^2 ^2/ l^21 - 4 ^2 l_p^2 ^2/l^2    from the _ reality _ of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , with the condition    ^2 < l^24 ^2 l_p^2 .    the left inequality in ( [ p : geup ] ) , as in ( [ p : flat ] ) of the gup , provides some small corrections to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle , due to the minimum length and momentum , for @xmath44 ,    p_i ( 1 + 2 ^2 l_p^2 ^2 l^2 ) x_i + ^2 x_il^2+^2 l_p^2(x_i)^3 + o ( ^4 l_p^4(x_i)^5 , ^2 l_p^2 ^4 x_il^4 ) .    by repeating the same arguments as in the gup and the eup cases ( with understanding that @xmath13 as the gup corrected horizon ) , one can obtain the hawking temperature @xmath45    [ geup : exact ] t_geup(ads)= ( d-34 ) r_+2 ^2 l_p^2    with the usual calibration factor ` @xmath46 ' and @xmath32 such as this agrees with the eup result ( [ eup : exact ] ) for a semiclassical black hole with @xmath47 ,    [ geup : ads ] t_geup(ads ) ( d-34 ) .    here , the third term is purely the gup correction and the second term in the first bracket @xmath48 is the _",
    "g_eup effect , and these correction terms are all positive .",
    "this shows that the hawking temperature of the ads black hole is increased also by the minimum uncertainty in the position , with the gup .    in the ads space .",
    "the eup , but without the gup , produces correctly the usual hawking temperature of the schwarzshild - ads black holes ( thin line ) .",
    "the existence of the absolute minimum in the temperature is a general consequence of the eup .",
    "but , as in the case of the flat space , there is no absolute minimum radius in the absence of the gup . with the gup ,",
    "the hawking temperature becomes hotter also , implying faster decay , and there is a minimum radius @xmath49^{1/2}$ ] where the curve ends , implying that the black hole evaporation stops ( thick line ) .",
    "here , i have plotted the cases with @xmath50.,width=264 ]    the analysis for the ds case is also straightforward . from the geup with @xmath35 ,",
    "one has    [ p : geup(ds ) ] & & p_i^(- ) p_i p_i^(+ ) , + & & p_i^()=x_i2 ^2 l_p^2    with the minimum uncertainty in @xmath4 ( but none in @xmath7 )    [ x : lower : geup(ds ) ] ( x_i)^2 4 ^2 l_p^21 + 4 ^2 l_p^2 ^2/l^2 .",
    "moreover , in order that @xmath51 is not negative one obtains the same condition as ( [ x : upper ] ) which is unchanged by the gup effect ( i.e. , no @xmath3 dependence ) , in contrast to the lower bound in ( [ x : lower : geup(ds ) ] ) .",
    "then , one finds the hawking temperature    [ geup : exact(ds ) ] t_geup(ds)= ( d-34 ) r_+2 ^2 l_p^2  ,    which gives    [ geup : ds ] t_geup(ds ) ( d-34 )    for semiclassical ds black holes with @xmath52 . here , note that the maximum bound of the black hole horizon ( [ n : horizon ] ) is not changed by the existence of the minimal length but the temperature is always increasing : the second term in the first bracket @xmath48 gives a negative correction but this is dominated by the third term , which is always positive .    in the ds space .",
    "the eup of ( [ eup : ds ] ) produces correctly the usual hawking temperature of the schwarzshild - ds black holes ( thin line ) , which vanishes at the nariai bound @xmath53 ; this defines the absolute maximum of the black hole horizon , but there is no absolute minimum radius . with the gup , the hawking temperature becomes hotter also , implying faster decay , and there is a minimum radius @xmath54^{1/2}$ ] where the curve ends , implying that the black hole evaporation stops ( thick line ) .",
    "here , i have plotted the cases with @xmath55.,width=264 ]    now , one finds a quite general trend that the gup due to a minimal length increases _ always _ the hawking temperature ( fig.2 , 3 ) , regardless of being asymptotically flat or ( a)ds space .",
    "this can be traced back to the _ universal _ appearance of the term `` @xmath56 '' in the temperature formula , which makes the decay to be faster .",
    "this seems to be also true in other forms of the deformation of the uncertainty principle park : tba .",
    "finally , two remarks are in order .",
    "first , one might consider the first law of thermodynamics to compute the gup corrected black hole entropy from the _ same _ adm mass formula as that of the case without the gup adle:01 .",
    "but , it still unclear how to fix _ uniquely _ the gup corrected mass formula from the gup corrected hawking temperature , without knowing the precise form the gup corrected gravity and its black hole solutions .",
    "second , i note that , in the @xmath57 limit of the ads black holes ( i.e. , the btz black hole limit ) , one has the hawking temperature    [ geup : ads3 ] t^(d=3)_geup(ads ) 4    from the series formula ( [ geup : ads ] ) , though it needs a scale tuning @xmath58 , with ` @xmath59= a fixed large number ' .",
    "this shows also an increase of the temperature , implying faster decay from the gup effect , compared to that of the usual btz black hole , @xmath60 .",
    "but , remarkably , there is a minimum temperature at @xmath61 and growing temperature for smaller black holes , in contrast to the monotonically decreasing temperature as @xmath13 becomes smaller in the btz black hole without the gup .",
    "if this were true , the hawking - page transition hawk:83 would occur even in three - dimensional ads space , due to the gup effect .",
    "but , this does not seem to occur from ( [ x : lower : ads ] ) , which implies @xmath62 for consistency of the exact formula ( [ p : geup ] ) , such as the evaporation stops before reaching the absolute minimum of the temperature at @xmath61 .",
    "this needs more rigorous analysis which can be well - defined in the three dimension , from the start park : tba .",
