    "constitutive models and integration algorithms for infinitesimal elastoplasticity are well established @xcite . the currently favoured algorithmic formulations , either cutting plane algorithms or closest point projection ones are based on the concept of trial elastic predictor and subsequent plastic correction @xcite .",
    "the implementations of the most efficient closest point projection algorithms perform both phases in just two subsequent substeps @xcite . from the 70 s ,",
    "quite a high number of formulations have been proposed to extend both the continuum and the computational small strain formulations to the finite deformation regime .",
    "very different ingredients have been employed in these formulations , as for example different kinematic treatments of the constitutive equations , different forms of the internal elastic - plastic kinematic decomposition , different types of stress and strain measures being used , different internal variables chosen as the basic ones and , most controversially , different evolution equations for the plastic flow .",
    "the combinations of these ingredients have resulted into very different extended formulations @xcite . however , as a common characteristic , all the formulations are developed with the main aim of preserving as much as possible the simplicity of the classical return mapping schemes of the infinitesimal theory @xcite through an algorithm that computes the closest point projection of the trial stresses onto the elastic domain .",
    "the first strategies to model finite strain elastoplasticity were based on both an additive decomposition of the deformation rate tensor into elastic and plastic contributions and a hypoelastic relation for stresses @xcite , see for example @xcite among many others .",
    "since the elastic stress relations are directly given in rate form and do not derive in general from a stored energy potential , some well - known problems may arise in these rate - form formulations , e.g. lack of objectivity of the resulting integration algorithms and the appearance of nonphysical energy dissipation in closed elastic cycles @xcite .",
    "incrementally objective integration algorithms @xcite overcome the former drawback ; the selection of the proper objective stress rate , i.e. the corotational logarithmic rate in the so - called self - consistent eulerian model @xcite circumvents the latter one @xcite . even though this approach is still being followed by several authors @xcite and may still be found in commercial finite element codes , the inherent difficulty associated to the preservation of objectivity in incremental algorithms makes these models less appealing from a computational standpoint @xcite .    shortly afterwards",
    "the intrinsic problems of hypoelastic rate models arose , several hyperelastic frameworks formulated relative to different configurations emerged @xcite .",
    "green - elastic , non - dissipative stresses are derived in these cases from a stored energy function , hence elastic cycles become path - independent and yield no dissipation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , objectivity requirements are automatically satisfied by construction of the hyperelastic constitutive relations @xcite .    in hyperelastic - based models ,",
    "the argument of the stored energy potential from which the stresses locally derive is an internal elastic strain variable that has to be previously defined from the total deformation .",
    "two approaches are common when large strains are considered . on the one hand ,",
    "metric plasticity models propose an additive split of a given lagrangian strain tensor into plastic and elastic contributions @xcite . on the other hand , multiplicative plasticity models are based on the multiplicative decomposition of the total deformation gradient into plastic and elastic parts @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the former type is that the proposed split is parallel to the infinitesimal one , where the additive decomposition of the total strain into plastic and elastic counterparts is properly performed , so these models somehow retain the desired simplicity of the small strain plasticity models @xcite .",
    "another immediate consequence is that these models are readily extended in order to include anisotropic elasticity and/or plasticity effects @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that add hoc decompositions in terms of plastic metrics do not represent correctly the elastic part of the deformation under general , non - coaxial elastoplastic deformations @xcite , hence its direct inclusion in the stored energy function may be questioned . for example",
    ", it has been found that these formulations do not yield a constant stress response when a perfectly plastic isotropic material is subjected to simple shear , a behavior which may be questionable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been recently shown @xcite that these formulations may even modify the ellipticity properties of the stored energy function at some plastic deformation levels , giving unstable elastic spring back computations as a result , which seems an unrealistic response .",
    "on the contrary , multiplicative plasticity models are micromechanically motivated from single crystal metal plasticity @xcite .",
    "the elastic part of the deformation gradient accounts for the elastic lattice deformation and the corresponding strain energy may be considered well defined . as a result ,",
    "the mentioned plastic shear and elastic spring back degenerate responses do not occur in these physically sound models @xcite .",
    "restricting now our attention to the widely accepted hyperelasto - plasticity formulations based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient @xcite , further kinematic and constitutive modelling aspects have to be defined .",
    "on one side , even though spatial quadratic strain measures were firstly employed @xcite , they proved not to be natural in order to preserve plastic incompressibility , which had to be explicitly enforced in the update of the intermediate placement @xcite .",
    "the fact that logarithmic strain measures inherit some properties from the infinitesimal ones , e.g. additiveness ( only within principal directions ) , material - spatial metric preservation , same deviatoric - volumetric projections , etc .",
    ", along with the excellent predictions that the logarithmic strain energy with constant coefficients provided for moderate elastic stretches @xcite , see also @xcite , motivated the consideration of the quadratic hencky strain energy in isotropic elastoplasticity formulations incorporating either isotropic or combined isotropic - kinematic hardening @xcite .",
    "exact preservation of plastic volume for pressure insensitive yield criteria is readily accomplished in this case . moreover , the incremental schemes written in terms of logarithmic strains preserve the desired structure of the standard return mapping algorithms of classical plasticity models @xcite , hence providing the simplest computational framework suitable for geometrically nonlinear finite element calculations .    on the other side , even though the use of logarithmic strain measures in actual finite strain computational elastoplasticity models has achieved a degree of common acceptance , a very controversial aspect of the theory still remains .",
    "this issue is the specific form that the evolution equations for the internal variables should adopt and how they must be further integrated @xcite , a topic coined as the rate issue  by sim @xcite .",
    "this issue originates , indeed , the key differences between the existing models . in this respect ,",
    "the selection of the basic internal variable , whether elastic or plastic , in which the evolution equation is written becomes fundamental in a large deformation context .",
    "evidently , this debate is irrelevant in the infinitesimal framework , where both the strains and the strain rates are fully additive .",
    "early works @xcite suggest that the same strain variable on which the material response depends , i.e. the internal elastic strains , should govern the internal dissipation @xcite .",
    "this argument seems also reasonable from a numerical viewpoint taking into account that in classical integration algorithms @xcite the trial stresses , which are elastic in nature and directly computed from the trial elastic strains , govern the dissipative return onto the elastic domain during the plastic correction substep . following this approach , sim @xcite used a continuum evolution equation for associative plastic flow explicitly expressed in terms of the lie derivative of the elastic left cauchy ",
    "green deformation tensor ( taken as the basic internal deformation variable @xcite ) .",
    "he then derived an exponential return mapping scheme to yield a closest point projection algorithm formulated in elastic logarithmic strain space identical in structure to the infinitesimal one , hence solving the rate issue  @xcite .",
    "however , the computational model is formulated in principal directions and restricted to isotropy , so arguably that debated issue was only partially solved . extensions of this approach to anisotropy are scarce , often involving important modifications regarding the standard return mapping algorithms ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .    instead , the probably most common approach when modeling large strain multiplicative plasticity in the finite element context lies in the integration of evolution equations for the plastic deformation gradient , as done originally by eterovic and bathe @xcite and weber and anand @xcite .",
    "the integration is performed through an exponential approximation to the incremental flow rule @xcite , so these formulations are restricted to moderately large elastic strains @xcite , which is certainly a minor issue in metal plasticity .",
    "however we note that it may be relevant from a computational standpoint if large steps are involved because the trial substep may involve non - moderate large strains . unlike sim s approach , these models retain a full tensorial formulation , so further consideration of elastic and/or plastic anisotropy is amenable @xcite .",
    "however , the consideration of elastic anisotropy in these models has several implications in both the continuum and the algorithmic formulations , all of them derived from the fact that the resulting thermodynamical stress tensor in the intermediate configuration , i.e. the mandel stress tensor @xcite , is non - symmetric in general .",
    "interestingly , the symmetric part of this stress tensor is , in practice , work - conjugate of the elastic logarithmic strain tensor for moderately large elastic deformations , which greatly simplifies the algorithmic treatment @xcite in anisotropic metal plasticity applications . as a result , the model in @xcite , formulated in terms of generalized kirchhoff stresses instead of kirchhoff stresses and with the additional assumption of vanishing plastic spin , becomes the natural generalization of the eterovic and bathe model @xcite to the fully anisotropic case , retaining at the same time the interesting features of the small strain elastoplasticity theory and algorithms .    summarizing , the computational model of caminero et al .",
    "@xcite is adequate for anisotropic elastoplasticity but not for non - moderate large elastic deformations .",
    "in contrast , the sim formulation @xcite is valid for large elastic strains but not for phenomenological anisotropic elastoplasticity . in this work we present a novel continuum elastoplasticity framework in full space description valid for anisotropic elastoplasticity and large elastic deformations consistent with the lee multiplicative decomposition .",
    "the main novelty is that , generalizing sim s approach @xcite , internal elastic deformation variables are taken as the basic variables that govern the local dissipation process .",
    "the dissipation inequality is reinterpreted taking into account that the chosen internal elastic tensorial variable depends on the respective internal plastic variable and also on the external one . in this reinterpretation",
    "we take special advantage of the concepts of partial differentiation and mapping tensors @xcite .",
    "the procedure is general and may be described in different configurations and in terms of different stress and strain measures , yielding as a result dissipation inequalities that are fully equivalent to each other .",
    "respective thermodynamical _ symmetric _ stress tensors and associative flow rules expressed in terms of corrector elastic strain rates and general yield functions are trivially obtained consistently with the principle of maximum dissipation .",
    "we recover the sim framework from our spatial formulation specialized to isotropy and with the additional assumption of vanishing plastic spin , as implicitly assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "exactly as it occurs in the infinitesimal theory , in all the descriptions being addressed the plastic spin does not take explicit part in the associative six - dimensional flow rules being derived , hence bypassing the necessity of postulating a flow rule for the plastic spin as an additional hypothesis in the dissipation equation @xcite .",
    "special advantage is taken when the continuum formulation is written in terms of the logarithmic elastic strain tensor @xcite  and its work - conjugated generalized kirchhoff _",
    "stress tensor , both defined in the intermediate configuration .",
    "then , the continuum formulation mimics the additive description in rate form of the infinitesimal elastoplasticity theory , the only differences coming from the additional geometrical nonlinearities arising in a finite deformation context . furthermore , the _ unconventional appearance _",
    "@xcite of the well - known continuum evolution equation defining plastic flow in terms of the lie derivative of the elastic left cauchy ",
    "green tensor in the current configuration @xcite makes way for a _ conventional _ evolution equation in terms of the elastic logarithmic strain rate tensor in the intermediate placement , hence simplifying the continuum formulation to a great extent and definitively solving the rate issue  directly in the logarithmic strain space .",
    "remarkably , with the present multiplicative elastoplasticity model at hand , the generally non - symmetric stress tensor that has traditionally governed the plastic dissipation in the intermediate configuration , i.e. the mandel stress tensor , is no longer needed .",
    "the rate formulation that we present herein in terms of logarithmic strains in the intermediate configuration may be immediately recast in a remarkably simple incremental form by direct backward - euler integration which results in integration algorithms of similar additive structure to those of the infinitesimal framework .",
    "indeed , the formulation derived herein is equivalent in many aspects to the anisotropic finite strain viscoelasticity model based on logarithmic strains and the sidoroff multiplicative decomposition that we presented in ref .",
    "as done therein , a first order accurate backward - euler algorithm could be directly employed over the corrector logarithmic elastic strain rate flow rule obtained herein to yield a return mapping scheme in full tensorial form , valid for anisotropic finite strain responses , that would preserve the appealing structure of the classical return mapping schemes of infinitesimal plasticity without modification . for the matter of simplicity in the exposition of the new elastoplasticity framework",
    ", we do not include kinematic hardening effects in the formulation .",
    "nevertheless , its further consideration would be straightforward .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we next present in section 2 the ideas for infinitesimal elastoplasticity in order to motivate and to prepare the parallelism with the finite strain formulation .",
    "thereafter we present in section 3 the large strain formulation in the spatial configuration performing such parallelism .",
    "we then particularize the present proposal to isotropy and demonstrate that some well - known formulations which are restricted to isotropy are recovered as a particular case from the more general , but at the same time simpler , anisotropic one .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the formulation in the intermediate configuration , where a comparison with existing formulations is presented and some difficulties encountered in the literature are discussed .",
    "section 5 presents the new approach to the problem at the intermediate configuration , both for quadratic strain measures and for our favoured logarithmic ones . in that section",
    "we also discuss the advantages and possibilities of the present framework .",
    "the purpose of this section is to motivate the concepts in the simpler infinitesimal description , showing a new subtle view of these equations which , thereafter result in a remarkable parallelism with the large strain formulations .",
    "consider the prandtl ( friction - spring ) rheological model for small strains shown in figure [ figure - leesmall0.eps ]    [ ptb ]    leesmall0.eps    where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the external , measurable infinitesimal strains and engineering stresses , respectively , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are internal , non - measurable infinitesimal strains describing the internal elastic and plastic behaviors .",
    "the internal strains relate to the external ones through@xmath4 so if we know the total deformation and one internal variable , then the other internal variable is uniquely determined .",
