    "there are experimental indications at present for three types of neutrino oscillations : solar@xcite , atmospheric@xcite , and laboratory@xcite .",
    "each may be explained in terms of two neutrinos differing in the square of their masses by roughly @xmath1 ev@xmath2 , @xmath3 ev@xmath2 , and 1 ev@xmath2 respectively . to accommodate all three possibilities ,",
    "it is clear that three neutrinos are not enough . on the other hand ,",
    "the invisible width of the @xmath4 boson is saturated already with the three known neutrinos , each transforming as part of a left - handed doublet under the standard electroweak @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "there is thus no alternative but to assume a light singlet neutrino which also mixes with the known three doublet neutrinos .",
    "as pointed out recently@xcite , this can be realized naturally with a specific extra u(1 ) factor contained in the superstring - inspired e@xmath0 model and its implied particle spectrum .    in section 2",
    "we map out the essential features of this supersymmetric @xmath6 model . in section 3",
    "we study the mixing of the standard @xmath4 boson with the @xmath7 boson required by the extra @xmath8 .",
    "we derive the effective contributions of this mixing to the electroweak oblique parameters @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and show that the @xmath8 mass scale could be a few tev . in section 4 we discuss the reduced higgs potential at the electroweak scale and show how the two - higgs - doublet structure of this model differs from that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in section 5 we consider the neutralino sector and show how the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of this model is constrained by the higgs sector .",
    "in section 6 we venture into the realm of gauge - coupling unification and propose two possible scenarios , each with some additional particles . finally in section 7",
    "there are some concluding remarks .",
    "the supersymmetric particle content of this model is given by the fundamental * 27 * representation of e@xmath0 . under @xmath11 ,",
    "the individual left - handed fermion components transform as follows@xcite .",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 as it stands , the allowed cubic terms of the superpotential are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , as well as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we now impose a @xmath25 discrete symmetry where all superfields are odd , except copy each of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , which are even . this gets rid of the cubic terms @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , but allows the quadratic terms @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the bosonic components of the even superfields serve as higgs bosons which break the gauge symmetry spontaneously .",
    "specifically , @xmath32 breaks @xmath8 and generates @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; the electroweak @xmath35 is then broken by two higgs doublets as in the mssm , with @xmath36 responsible for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",

    "this means that the usual seesaw mechanism holds for the three doublet neutrinos : @xmath51 , whereas the two singlet neutrinos have masses @xmath52 and mix with the former through @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath53 is really a @xmath54 matrix because there are 3 copies of ( @xmath55 ) and 2 copies of ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "are conveniently parametrized@xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electromagnetic fine - structure constant . in the above we",
    "have also indicated how @xmath74 mixing as measured in the lepton sector would affect the oblique @xmath10 parameters defined originally for the gauge - boson self energies only@xcite .",
    "the present precision data from lep at cern are consistent with the standard model but the experimental error bars are of order a few @xmath85@xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath86 tev is allowed .",
    "note also that the relative sign of @xmath9 is necessarily the same in this model .",
    "the first stage of symmetry breaking occurs with @xmath69 . from @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ", we see that @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , @xmath94 combines with @xmath7 to form a massive vector gauge boson and @xmath95 is a massive scalar boson .",
    "both have the same mass : @xmath96 the reduced higgs potential involving only the two doublets is then of the standard form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 assuming that @xmath99 and @xmath100 are real for simplicity . in the above",
    ", we have of course also assumed implicitly that @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are all small in magnitude relative to @xmath104 .",
    "the quartic scalar couplings @xmath105 receive contributions not only from the coefficients of the corresponding terms in @xmath92 and @xmath106 , but also from the cubic couplings of @xmath95 to the doublets which are proportional to @xmath107 , as shown in fig .  1 . as a result@xcite ,",
    "@xmath108 it is obvious from the above that the two - higgs - doublet sector of this model differs from that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and reduces to the latter only in the limit @xmath109 . note that if @xmath103 is of order @xmath110 , then it is not consistent to assume that both @xmath111 and @xmath112 are light . in that case",
    ", only a linear combination of @xmath111 and @xmath112 may be light and the electroweak higgs sector reduces to that of just one doublet , as in the minimal standard model .    since @xmath113 of eq .",
    "( 22 ) should be bounded from below , we must have @xmath114 hence @xmath115 has an upper bound . for @xmath116 which is a very good approximation if @xmath62 and @xmath8 are unified only at a very high energy scale , we find that the ratio @xmath117 has to be less than about 0.35 .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the upper bound on the lighter of the two neutral scalar higgs bosons is given in general by @xmath118 + \\epsilon,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 comes from radiative corrections , the largest contribution being that of the top quark : @xmath120 with @xmath121 coming from soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in the present model , this becomes @xmath122 + \\epsilon.\\ ] ] considered as a function of @xmath115 , the above quantity is maximized at @xmath123 assuming that @xmath116 as before , we find @xmath124 to be always smaller than the upper bound we obtained earlier from requiring @xmath125 .",
    "hence we plot @xmath126 in fig .  2 for @xmath127 and @xmath109 as functions of @xmath128 , as the maximum allowed values of @xmath33 in this model and in the mssm respectively .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath129 gev and @xmath130 tev , @xmath33 may be as high as 140 gev in this model , as compared to 128 gev in the mssm .    for the charged higgs boson @xmath131 and the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath132",
    ", we now have the sum rule @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "note that the above equation is common to all extensions@xcite of the mssm with the term @xmath135 in the superpotential and would serve as an unambiguous signal of physics beyond the mssm at the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "in the mssm , there are four neutralinos ( two gauge fermions and two higgs fermions ) which mix in a well - known @xmath136 mass matrix@xcite . here",
    "we have six neutralinos : the gauginos of @xmath62 and the third component of @xmath61 , the higgsinos of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , the @xmath8 gaugino and the @xmath139 higgsino .",
    "the corresponding mass matrix is then given by @xmath140,\\ ] ] where @xmath141 are allowed @xmath142 and @xmath143 gauge - invariant majorana mass terms which break the supersymmetry softly .",
    "note that without the last two rows and columns , the above matrix does reduce to that of the mssm if @xmath144 is identified with @xmath145 . recall that if @xmath99 is very small , then the two - higgs - doublet sector of this model is essentially indistinguishable from that of the mssm , but now a difference will show up in the neutralino sector unless the @xmath146 parameter of the mssm accidentally also happens to be very small . in other words , there is an important correlation between the higgs sector and the neutralino sector of this model which is not required in the mssm .",
    "since @xmath147 can not be small , the neutralino mass matrix @xmath148 reduces to either a @xmath136 or @xmath65 matrix , depending on whether @xmath149 is small or not . in the former case",
    ", it reduces to that of the mssm but with the stipulation that the @xmath146 parameter must be small , _",
    "i.e. _ of order 100 gev .",
    "this means that the two gauginos mix significantly with the two higgsinos and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is likely to have nonnegligible components from all four states . in the latter case ,",
    "the effective @xmath65 mass matrix becomes @xmath150.\\ ] ] since @xmath151 is small , the mass eigenstates of @xmath152 are approximately the gauginos @xmath153 and @xmath154 , with masses @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively . in supergravity models , @xmath157 hence @xmath153 would be the lsp .    in the chargino sector , the corresponding mass matrix is @xmath158.\\ ] ] if @xmath149 is small , then both charginos can be of order 100 gev , but if @xmath149 is large ( say of order 1 tev ) , then only one may be light and its mass would be @xmath156 . in the mssm , the superpotential has the allowed term @xmath159 . hence there is no understanding as to why @xmath146 should be of order of the supersymmetry breaking scale , and not in fact very much greater . here",
    "@xmath149 is naturally of order of the @xmath8 breaking scale , and since the latter can not be broken without also breaking supersymmetry , the two scales are necessarily equivalent .",
    "this solves the so - called @xmath146 problem of the mssm .",
    "in the mssm , the three gauge couplings @xmath160 , @xmath67 , and @xmath161 have been shown to converge to a single value at around @xmath162 gev@xcite . in the present model , with particle content belonging to complete * 27 * representations of e@xmath0 and nothing else , this unification simply does not occur .",
    "this is a general phenomenon of all grand unified models : the experimental values of the three known gauge couplings at the electroweak energy scale are not compatible with a single value at some higher scale unless the particle content ( excluding the gauge bosons ) has different total contributions to the evolution of each coupling as a function of energy scale .",
    "the evolution equations of @xmath163 are generically given to two - loop order by @xmath164 \\alpha_i^2 ( \\mu),\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is the running energy scale and the coefficients @xmath165 and @xmath166 are determined by the particle content of the model .",
    "to one loop , the above equation is easily solved : @xmath167 below @xmath168 , assume the standard model with two higgs doublets , then @xmath169 above @xmath168 in the mssm , @xmath170 note that in the above , the three supersymmetric families of quarks and leptons contribute equally to each coupling , whereas the two supersymmetric higgs doublets do not .",
    "the reason is that the former belong to complete representations of @xmath171 but not the latter . for @xmath172 gev",
    ", the gauge couplings would then unify at @xmath173 gev in the mssm .    in the present model",
    "as it is , the one - loop coefficients of eq .",
    "( 38 ) above @xmath174 are @xmath175 because there are three complete * 27 * supermultiplets of e@xmath0 .",
    "[ actually @xmath45 is superheavy but it transforms trivially under @xmath6 . ] to achieve gauge - coupling unification , we must add new particles in a judicious manner .",
    "one possibility is to mimic the mssm by adding one extra copy of the anomaly - free combination @xmath176 and @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath177 since the relative differences of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 are now the same as in the mssm , we have again unification at @xmath173 gev , from which we can predict the value of @xmath66 at @xmath181 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the evolution of @xmath182 using also the two - loop coefficients @xmath183.\\ ] ] we work in the @xmath184 scheme , and take the two - loop matching conditions accordingly@xcite . as an example , we use @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 at the scale @xmath188 gev .",
    "we also choose @xmath189 tev and use the top quark mass @xmath190 gev .",
    "note that the value of @xmath191 is always close to that of @xmath192 since their one - loop beta fuctions are close in value to each other and they are required to be unified at the scale @xmath193 .",
    "another possibility is to exploit the allowed variation of particle masses near the superstring scale of @xmath194 @xcite in the @xmath184 scheme .",
    "just as yukawa couplings are assumed to be subject only to the constraints of the unbroken gauge symmetry , the masses of the superheavy * 27 * and * 27@xmath195 * multiplet components may also be allowed to vary accordingly .",
    "for example , take three copies of @xmath196 and @xmath197 with @xmath198 much below @xmath193 , then between @xmath198 and @xmath193 , @xmath199 @xmath200 for @xmath201 gev , gauge - coupling unification at @xmath202 gev is again achieved .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the evolution of @xmath182 using also the two - loop coefficients @xmath203\\ ] ] between @xmath168 and @xmath198 , and @xmath204\\ ] ] between @xmath198 and @xmath193 . as an example",
    ", we use @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath205 at the scale @xmath188 gev , @xmath206 tev and the top quark mass @xmath190 gev . for @xmath207",
    ", we find @xmath208 gev .",
    "it should be emphasized that the sharp turn at @xmath198 should not be taken too literally but only as an indication that gauge couplings may in fact evolve drastically near the unification energy scale .",
    "this possibility allows us to have unification without having split multiplets containing both superheavy and light components , as in most grand unified models .",
    "the size of @xmath191 is always very close to that of @xmath192 since they have the same one - loop beta functions for scales beneath @xmath198 and are required to be unified at @xmath193 .",
    "we note that the two - loop corrections are larger here than in the mssm due to the much larger particle content .",
    "we also observe that for @xmath207 we obtain an @xmath193 which is about 1.5 times the superstring scale of @xmath209 , whereas the @xmath193 in most supersymmetric grand unified models is about 0.04 times that number .",
    "to accommodate a naturally light singlet neutrino , an extra u(1 ) factor is called for .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the superstring - inspired e@xmath0 model is tailor - made for this purpose as it contains @xmath8 which has exactly the required properties . to obtain @xmath8 as an unbroken gauge group ,",
    "we need to break e@xmath0 spontaneously along the @xmath45 and @xmath210 directions with superheavy * 27 * s and * 27@xmath195 * s while preserving supersymmetry .",
    "this is impossible if the superpotential is allowed only terms up to cubic order so that the theory is renormalizable . on the other hand",
    ", the requirement of renormalizability may not be applicable at the superstring unification scale , in which case the quartic term @xmath211 * 27 27@xmath195 27 27@xmath195 * in conjunction with the quadratic term @xmath212 * 27 27@xmath195 * in the superpotential would result in @xmath213 * 27 * @xmath214 = @xmath213 * 27@xmath195 * @xmath214 = @xmath215 without breaking supersymmetry .",
    "the addition of @xmath8 has several other interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "( 1 ) the @xmath8 neutral gauge boson z mixes with the standard - model z and affects the precision data at lep . from the present experimental error bars on the @xmath9 parameters , we find that the @xmath8 breaking scale could be as low as a few tev .",
    "( 2 ) the spontaneous breaking of @xmath8 is accomplished only with the presence of a mass term in the higgs potential which breaks the supersymmetry softly .",
    "hence the reduced two - doublet higgs potential at the electroweak energy scale is not guaranteed to be that of the mssm .",
    "in fact , the scalar quartic couplings now depend also on a new yukawa coupling @xmath99 as well as the gauge coupling @xmath66 . assuming that @xmath216",
    ", one result is that the upper bound on the lighter of the two neutral scalar higgs bosons is now 140 gev instead of 128 gev in the mssm .",
    "( 3 ) the neutralino mass matrix also depends on @xmath99 , hence there is a correlation here with the higgs sector .",
    "such a connection is not present in the mssm .",
    "( 4 ) this model may also be compatible with gauge - coupling unification .",
    "we identify two possible scenarios .",
    "one is just like the mssm with two light doublets presumably belonging to complete multiplets ( of the grand unified group ) whose other members are superheavy ; the other requires no light - heavy splitting but assumes a large variation of superheavy masses near the unification scale .",
