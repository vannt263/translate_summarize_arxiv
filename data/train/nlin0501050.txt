    "since the 1960 s , a great number of papers have considered the properties of solitons in nonlinear optic media with a kerr - type ( cubic ) nonlinearity .",
    "this media can be modelled by the cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "as it is well known , the nls equation is integrable and , in consequence , solitons interact elastically @xcite .    more recently , several authors have studied the properties of solitons in photo - refractive media @xcite . in this case , the equation describing these media is a modification of the original nls , which consists in substituting the kerr nonlinearity term by another one of saturable type .",
    "this saturable ( snls ) equation is nonintegrable and the soliton collision processes are inelastic , leading to annihilation , fusion or creation of solitons @xcite .",
    "this last phenomena consists of the appearance of three solitons after the collision of only two of them .",
    "another important feature of the snls is that the behaviour of the solutions is quite generic , being independent of the details of the mathematical model .",
    "the _ discrete _ version of the nls equation can be used to describe nonlinear waveguide arrays within the tight binding approximation @xcite .",
    "the existence and properties of mobile discrete breathers / solitons in dnls lattices has been considered in a number of studies ( we use the terms breathers and solitons interchangeably in this context , also intrinsic localized modes ) .",
    "an early brief study @xcite showed that breathers could propagate along the lattice with a small loss of energy , and could become trapped by inhomogeneities in the lattice . later , a more detailed study @xcite suggested that `` exact '' travelling breathers might exist , at least for some parameter ranges .",
    "the reviews @xcite refer to many other papers in this area .",
    "more recently , work has concentrated on breathers with infinite oscillating tails @xcite , although the question of the _ existence _ of _ exact _ breather solutions which tend to zero as @xmath0 has not yet been resolved . given the long history of mobile breather solutions of this equation , it is rather surprising that a systematic study of the collision of two breathers in the dnls model has only recently been carried out @xcite .",
    "( we mention also that collisions have been studied in generalised nearly integrable dnls model in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , some studies have considered the existence of mobile breathers in waveguide arrays in photo - refractive crystal , described by a dnls equation with saturable nonlinearity @xcite . in particular , these papers considered a discrete version of the vinetskii - kukhtarev model @xcite .",
    "the key difference between the cubic dnls equation and the saturable dnls equation is that in the later , the peierls ",
    "nabarro barrier ( the energy difference between a bond - centred and a site - centred breather with the same power ) is bounded and , in most cases , smaller than in the former @xcite .",
    "it allows the existence of mobile breathers of high power .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study breather - breather collisions in a saturable dnls equation and to compare the results with those obtained in the continuous snls and the discrete cubic equation .",
    "the system we consider is governed by the following equation of motion @xmath1 this model has two conserved quantities : the hamiltonian @xmath2 $ ] and the power ( or norm ) @xmath3 .    in order to reduce the dimension of the large parameter space to be considered , we have fixed @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "higher values of @xmath4 lead to solutions that only can be moved for a restricted set of power values @xcite .    a moving breather",
    "@xmath6 is obtained by adding a thrust @xmath7 to a stationary breather @xmath8 , so that : @xmath9 notice that this procedure of obtaining moving breathers is similar to the marginal mode method introduced in @xcite for klein  gordon lattices .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the collision of two identical breathers moving in opposite directions with the same thrust @xmath7 .",
    "analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider both inter - site ( is ) and on - site ( os ) collisions .",
    "the collision scenario we observe for small @xmath10 is quite simple : there exists a critical value @xmath11 below which breathers form a bound state , and above which , breathers are reflected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : example]a - b for examples of these two cases ) .",
    "it can be observed that the bound state `` oscillates '' after the collision .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations decreases when approaching to the critical point , whereas their `` period '' increases .",
    "( note that the `` reflection '' case could equally be regarded as a transmission case as the two breathers are indistinguishable . in the case of reflection / transmission",
    ", there is some loss of energy of the two breathers ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have analyzed the collisional behaviour in a saturable dnls model , finding close analogies to the continuous nls equation .",
    "breathers can merge , reflect or be created ( although breather annihilation is not observed ) .",
    "the extra power available to breathers in the sdnls case results in the new phenomena of breather creation in a discrete model . additionally , the scenario in the saturable dnls case seems to be much `` cleaner '' than in the cubic dnls case on a coarse scale , with a strong but simpler threshold effect .",
    "these facts may be an advantage in some applications , such as multi - port optical switching .",
    "there are still a number of details in the fine - scale structure which are as yet unexplained .",
    "these may perhaps be understood through the application of a future variational study .",
    "it would also be interesting to extend this study to consider the collision of two non - identical breathers .",

    "the other ( jce ) would like to acknowledge the hospitality of the university of seville for hosting research visits during which this work was discussed .",
    "* notes added in proof * since the original version of this paper was written , khare et al.@xcite have published an exact stationary breather solution for an equation closely related to ( [ eq : dyn ] ) , namely @xmath12 solutions of ( [ krss ] ) can be mapped into solutions of ( [ eq : dyn ] ) by the ( invertible ) transformation @xmath13 so the solutions given @xcite can be mapped into solutions of ( [ eq : dyn ] ) . however the localized stationary breather solution of @xcite only exists for @xmath14 , and hence are not relevant to our discussions which focus on the @xmath5 case .",
    "it would be interesting to extending the calculations in this paper to other values of @xmath4 to see if the presence of these stationary solutions affected the results given here ."
