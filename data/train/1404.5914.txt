    "the presence of cosmic rays , cr , their sources and their acceleration is presently an open problem in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "cosmic rays are able to be accelerated because cr are charged particles . unfortunately for the same reason cr charges suffer of relic ( large scale ) galactic and extragalactic magnetic field bending .",
    "such a random walk in the magnetic field forest make smooth and homogeneous their arrival direction .",
    "incidentally the same presence of such large scale magnetic fields test the absence in cr of any detectable magnetic monopole particle trace , the so called parker bound ; we know of such far magnetic fields presence by the consequent faraday rotation of far polarized radio - sources . therefore cr are smeared and do not offer any cr astronomy .",
    "the rarest ultra high energy cosmic rays , uhecr , above tens eev , were expected to be less bent and to correlate with their nearby ( super - galactic ) sources because of their rigidity and straight directionality .",
    "this hope rose few years ago and it faded quite soon .",
    "no super - galactic imprint in uhecr maps has been found yet . indeed , an additional variable generate confusion and smearing : the uhecr composition has been observed as heavy nuclei ( auger ) or light nuclei or protons ( hires - ta ) .",
    "therefore cr are smeared . for a comparable reason the smeared cr while hitting the earth atmosphere mimic the mess by producing a diffused rain of secondaries pions @xmath9 , kaons @xmath10 and muons @xmath11 , whose final traces in underground detectors are also smeared neutrinos : the so called atmospheric neutrinos . therefore any eventual neutrino astronomy is drowned in such a smooth sea of atmospheric neutrino noise .",
    "neutrinos have their own identities , or flavors : they do not behave at same way . in effect , the slow decay of muons respect to the @xmath9 one or the @xmath10 one , makes above few tens - hundred gev the atmospheric @xmath3 flux more rare respect to the @xmath2 flux nearly by an order of magnitude .",
    "this implies a muon - rich signal at tevs ( long track traces ) respect to rarer @xmath3 showers observed in deep core inside icecube as small cascade showers .",
    "therefore as soon as icecube highest energy events have shown ruling cascades ( mostly originated by @xmath3 or @xmath4 charged current , cc , interaction ) , then the atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite @xcite , has been overcome by a new neutrino sky , mostly of extraterrestrial and astrophysical nature .",
    "originally the icecube attention was for the search of uhe neutrinos at eev gzk cosmological edges @xcite , but recent results are at lower pev energy windows .",
    "tau eev neutrinos @xmath4 , @xmath12 might hit the earth , produce and eev @xmath13 lepton whose escape and decay in flight becoming observable ( and searchable ) as an horizontal fluorescence @xmath13 airshower @xcite ; this probable event has not been observed yet @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation @xcite and mixing @xcite from far galactic or extragalactic distance may overshadow most atmospheric neutrino flavor composition ruled by a final flavor ratio at tev : @xmath14 , into a more ",
    "democratic \" flavor composition above 30 tev , as the observed one , approximately of @xmath15 , also assuming the mild additional presence of neutral current cascades @xcite , @xcite . these signals might be born by a huge agn flaring jets or by more abundant grb precessing jets in competition with more conventional snrs - microjets sources possibly origin of cr at lower ( pevs ) energy edge .",
    "these extra - terrestrial events may be both of galactic and extragalactic nature .",
    "the cr and uhecr neutral parasite secondaries , @xmath7 , x , radio synchrotron signals suggest the agn , bl lac hypothesis for uhe @xmath1 .",
    "the one - shoot grb model is not well correlated up to our days with any observed uhe neutrino in icecube . some rare precursor event a few hour before the @xmath7 burst might be correlated , but they call for a long life precessing gamma jet model @xcite often ignored respect to the ( still ) popular one shoot fireball model .",
    "more common agn , galactic cluster , star forming clusters or extragalactic ir sources are the possible birth place of uhe neutrinos .",
    "therefore we need a better view of the cr and possibly their related inner probe made by uhe neutrinos .",
    "uhecr were expected to produce ( by scattering on bbr photons ) an observable rate of photo - pions and eev neutrino ( the cosmogenic neutrinos ) .",
    "this scattering on relic photons lead to an opacity , the so - called gzk cut off in uhecr spectra , that is still experimentally unsettled because it might be in debt also of an intrinsic acceleration limit and/or to a changing mass composition role .",
    "therefore the pev neutrinos are not clearly related to such gzk eev uhecr .",
    "these uhecr cut off in gzk opacity , @xcite , the consequent cosmo - genic neutrinos are possibly better observable soon as tau airshower @xcite at eev ( also so called earth - skimming neutrinos @xcite ) in auger @xcite , @xcite , hires , ta or ashra array telescopes ; such a tau airshower signal has not been yet revealed , although the time seem already mature , at least in ashra @xcite experiment tuned to pev energies .",
    "the tau airshower astronomy is a secondary tail of the @xcite double bang proposal , that might be observable also in icecube by ellipsoidal or separate pevs future events .",
    "however , in conclusion , the severe @xmath7 bbr opacity to photons above galactic distances at pev ( 10 kpc ) , suggest pev neutrino of extragalactic origin .",
    "let us remind that the recent icecube spectrum near pev is tailed and cut @xcite to avoid any ( enhanced and also expected ) resonant @xmath16 event at @xmath17 pev @xcite",
    ". therefore the novel extraterrestrial signal at pev @xcite and below is fine - tuned to be suppressed at higher energies . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    "the contained events are mostly cascade showers whose angular resolution is poor : thus , any correlation with sources or other mass distribution become difficult .",
    "the absence of high angular resolution for cascades and the rareness ( 7 ) of contained @xmath2 events makes the ability to radically improve such contained uhe neutrino astronomy critical .",
    "the high energy muon @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the most penetrating muons ( up to eev energy where @xmath13 , @xmath20 become the winning leptons ) and they may be originated well outside the same icecube volume .",
    "their larger size detection simply amplify the @xmath2 neutrino volume and their presence : the energy losses of the muons is ( within tevs - pevs energy ) reasonable foreseen , growing proportionally to the muon energy , therefore linking their emission photon number to their energy and its @xmath18 length to the logarithmic energy growth ; these distances are leading to a larger volume and a wider rate of crossing muon neutrino events .",
    "the muon distance in the water or ice may be described @xcite within ( tev - pev ) by this simple phenomenological law : @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 km .",
    "these large distances above tens tev or pev energy makes the effective detector for uhe @xmath2 an order of magnitude larger than the other contained flavors ( cascade - shower , bounded spherical events ) .",
    "the most recent declination distribution spectra shown in moriond @xcite for the recent @xmath23 icecube events is allowing us to extrapolate the expected crossing tev muon number at each declination by simple approximations ( based on geometry and muon lenght ) .",
    "the volume and the rate is proportional to the _ allowed muon track distance outside _ the icecube detector .",
    "the earth distribution around the detector , the earth opacity , the allowed muon distance in above formula around the @xmath24 tev energy will cross almost @xmath25 km : one might imagine to multiply simply this number for the observed @xmath26 event reaching @xmath27 expected signals .",
    "this first value is quite over - estimated because the geometry is not equally spread around icecube : the mass above the detector is only @xmath28 km depth .",
    "moreover the observed angular distribution event rate has to been more carefully considered leading to smaller estimate . rounding ( to unity ) each zenith width spectra , from downward to upward as in figure",
    ", we found as shown in figure below an amplified number of crossing @xmath18 events ( respectively from downward to upward versus : @xmath29 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath26 , @xmath26 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath29 ) , for each zenith arrival , for a total of nearly @xmath8 ( but a wide error margin below or about @xmath34 ) .",
    "let us try with present numbers an an early statistical forecast .",
    "let us estimate for present ( approximated ) @xmath8 forecast crossing uhe muons events , each of them occupying a tiny solid angle of area @xmath35 ( for a muon resolution angle @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 sr respect the whole @xmath38 of the sky , is @xmath39@xmath40 .",
    "this ratio , @xmath41 is very small indeed : @xmath42 the last enhanced approximation takes place because we considered ( again as a zero order approximation ) at @xmath43 tev energy , a partial neutrino opacity to the earth reducing the whole observable sky from @xmath44 to nearly @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the probability to overlap with any other different neutrino event may be estimated .",
    "it is more convenient to first estimate the probability @xmath46 _ not to observe _ any overlapping ( doublet , triplet or poker ) in the sky ; this value being : @xmath47;\\ ] ] this product sequence might be estimated either imagining an average quadratic expression or , in equivalent way , considering first @xmath48 , secondly by making the exponent product sequence as a sum of each @xmath49 term ( @xmath50 ) ; because of the tiny value of the upper bound ( @xmath51 ) each logarithmic element maybe approximated to @xmath52 . in this way",
    "the whole exponent sum becomes : @xmath53 this value assuming our ( tentative ) estimate of muon crossing in three years is : @xmath54 therefore the probability to _ not _ find pairs is large , and the consequent probability to observe at least a doublet ( or more ) is @xmath55 , being 13% low but not extremely low .    the probability to discover at least two pairs could be smaller and we estimated it , once again assuming as a first approach the product of the same probability to observe at once twice of such an event : @xmath56^{2}= 1.77\\%}$ ] . to be more correct one may estimate the same probability to observe at least two pairs as certainty ( 1 ) minus the probability of no pair ( @xmath57 ) or just one pair ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the result ( comparable to the previous one ) is : @xmath59 @xmath60\\ ] ] this result in such a first forecast may be also written as follows : @xmath61^{2 } = 1.97\\%\\ ] ]    therefore the finding of two or more pairs may reduce the probability to be a chance ( or viceversa it may confirm the @xmath1 self - correlation ) at a small percent .",
    "three pairs as we may expect reduce this probability at nearly below @xmath62 ; the same presence of just one triplet may also reduce the probability to be a chances as small as @xmath63 . a quadruplet or more",
    "multiplets might drive the neutrino astronomy even to a potential test of flavor ratio estimates , a revolution now , beyond to our most optimistic dreams .",
    "their total large ( nearly @xmath8 ) number and they track narrow beam may dig in the sky map correlations and multiplet clustering along known sources . ]",
    "the discover of the highest energy neutrino astronomy require a high resolution probe .",
    "recent @xmath0 icecube highest energetic events are mostly @xmath64 cascade showers with poor arrival angle @xmath65 , while @xmath31 muon tracks directions for contained events point to a much narrow angle as @xmath66 , but they are rare ; therefore muon track solid angle is more than two order of magnitude smaller and sharper by solid angle than cascade ones .",
    "the present spread shower signals in icecube maps are not useful to address clearly to any smoking gun sources , nor to test large scale anisotropy . clustering along a source , possibly along galactic regions ( in analogy to the observed cen - a uhecr multiplet events in auger maps or to the argo - milagro anisotropy sky at tevs cr ) , might favor also the presence of uhecr radioactive decay in flight , bent by magnetic fields @xcite , whose decay secondaries could be @xmath7 and also tevs - pev neutrinos . however",
    "the need for sharp neutrino maps is compelling .",
    "the abundant muon crossing at highest ( tens tev ) tracks , tagged by their huge energy release , are self selected as extraterrestrial and they are a very rich key to discover by a sharp view the highest energy neutrino sky",
    ". a rare doublet may be not yet convincing ; but two or above doublets and/or rare triplet within the expected @xmath67 events may make the steps into neutrino astronomy .",
    "very recent presentation @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ crossing ] did show the preliminary crossing muons spectra ( but not their map yet ) corresponding to upgoing and horizontal crossing muons .",
    "their rate for two years is nearly @xmath68 events , consistent with our recent @xcite and here reconfirmed estimate .    ) . ]",
