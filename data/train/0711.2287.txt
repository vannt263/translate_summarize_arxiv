    "quantum systems of three identical particles have attracted a considerable interest during the last years , principally due to very recent experimental and theoretical advances in the field of ultra - cold degenerate gases .",
    "one such example of the recent experimental advances is the observation of three - body efimov states @xcite in ultra cold gas of cesium @xcite .",
    "another motivation to study quantum few - body problems is due to recent experiments with interacting atoms and molecules trapped in optical lattices .",
    "the interaction between a few atoms ( or molecules ) in optical traps can be changed by an appropriately chosen external field .",
    "understanding and controlling the interaction between atoms ( and molecules ) in optical lattice contributes into the progress in the domain of quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "one aspect of the interaction in the three - body system is the selection rules determining allowed and forbidden final states of the system after the scattering process . for three identical particles ,",
    "there are three possible configurations before , during and after a collision .",
    "namely , ( 1 ) the three particles are far from each other and do not interact at all , ( 2 ) two of the three particles are close and interact with each other , but the third particle is situated far from them and therefore can be considered as free , and ( 3 ) the three particles are close to each other such that the interaction between them can not be neglected . for each of these configurations , one can assign a set of appropriate quantum numbers . before and after a collision , the configuration may change .",
    "therefore , the set of quantum numbers may also be different before and after the collision",
    ". however , there are relationships between the sets corresponding to different configurations .",
    "in addition , some quantum numbers are the same in the three sets and are therefore conserved during the collision . such correlations between the three sets of quantum numbers are the consequence of the conservation of symmetry of the total wave function of the system . the symmetry of rotational and vibrational wave functions of the system of three indistinguishable particles has been studied previously by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , there was no systematic description of the correlation between quantum numbers appropriate for all the three possible configurations . in this article , we discuss the three sets of appropriate quantum numbers and derive the rules describing the correlations between different quantum numbers in the three sets . since there exist some selection rules regarding the change in the quantum numbers , we derive and discuss them in detail .    in section [ sec : symmetry ]",
    ", we will give a brief overview of symmetry properties of the three identical particles and general rules for construction of wave functions .",
    "then , in section [ sec : configuration ] , we present wave functions and the corresponding quantum numbers appropriate for each of the three configurations of the system . in section [ sec : diagrams ] , we derive the scattering selection rules and represent them by diagrams of correlation between the three sets of quantum numbers , similar to the case of diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the group @xmath0 of permutations of three identical particles is isomorphic to the point group of symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "geometrically , the system with the @xmath1 symmetry can be represented by a flat equilateral triangle containing the six following elements : three reflexions @xmath2 through three vertical planes perpendicular to the plane of the triangle , two rotations @xmath3 by @xmath4 in the plane of the triangle and the identity operator @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "adding to @xmath0 the operator of inversion @xmath6 , the new group @xmath7 becomes isomorphic to the point group @xmath8 , which itself can be represented as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the reflection through the symmetry plane .",
    "relative motion of three structureless particles is characterized by the @xmath1 group .",
    "if rotation of the whole system in a space - fixed coordinate frame needs to be accounted for , then , the symmetry of the system is represented by the @xmath8 group . in our discussion",
    "we will be using the same notations for elements @xmath11 of the group @xmath8 as in @xcite ; the 12 elements @xmath11 are @xmath12 without inversion plus the same elements with the inversion @xmath13 .",
    "each eigenstate of the hamiltonian of the system is transformed in the @xmath8 group according to one of the six @xmath8 irreducible representations : @xmath14 , or @xmath15 .",
    "the representations @xmath16 and @xmath15 are two - dimensional . for convenience , we define bases in the @xmath16 and @xmath15 representations .",
    "namely , in the two - dimensional space of @xmath16 we use two orthogonal basis states , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whose properties are such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the basis states turn into each other through operator @xmath21 .",
    "the basis states , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the @xmath15 representation are defined in the same way .",
    "having defined the bases in @xmath16 and @xmath15 , we can represent an arbitrary state @xmath24 of the system as a superposition of eight functions , each transforming as @xmath25 , or @xmath26 .",
    "each term in the superposition can formally be obtained by projecting the state @xmath24 on the corresponding function .",
    "the projector operator on the basis state @xmath27 is represented by the following sum @xmath28 here , the sum is taken over all 12 elements @xmath11 of the @xmath8 group .",
    "this formula is just the regular projector on a one - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath27 of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in the above equation , @xmath29 are the well - known characters @xcite if @xmath27 is an one - dimensional irreducible representation . coefficients @xmath29 for the states @xmath30 or @xmath30 are given in table [ table : characters ] .",
    "@xmath27 & @xmath31 & * ( 123 ) * & * ( 132 ) * & * ( 12)*&*(23)*&*(13 ) & @xmath13 & * ( 123)*@xmath32&*(132)@xmath32&*(12)@xmath32&*(23)@xmath32&*(13)@xmath32 + * * * * *    @xmath30 & 1&@xmath33 & @xmath34 & 1 & @xmath35&@xmath33 & 1 & @xmath33&@xmath34 & 1 & @xmath35&@xmath33 + @xmath36 & 1&@xmath37 & @xmath34 & 1 & @xmath35&@xmath33 & -1 & @xmath38&@xmath39 & -1 & @xmath40&@xmath38 +    for simplicity , we will only consider the coordinate part of total wave function of the system .",
    "the electronic and nuclear spin statistics of three identical particles can be described using a similar approach , which is briefly discussed in our conclusion .",
    "we are interested in selection rules in the collision process , which starts with a given state @xmath24 of the system .",
    "the state @xmath24 is usually specified by a set of quantum numbers that are appropriate for the initial configuration of the system .",
    "these quantum numbers are in general not conserved during the scattering process",
    ". however , they are sufficient to decompose the state into the sum of irreducible representation of the group @xmath8 .",
    "a given irreducible representation is conserved during the collision and can be viewed as a good quantum number , allowing the characterization of the possible final states of the system .",
    "therefore , decomposition of initial states into irreducible representations of @xmath8 allows us to derive the selection rules , i.e. to point out which final states ( characterized by other set of quantum numbers ) are not accessible from that given initial state ; if the operator @xmath41 acting on @xmath24 gives identically 0 , it means that final states transforming according to @xmath27 are not accessible from the initial state @xmath24 .",
    "before deriving the selection rules , we derive relations between appropriate quantum numbers at different configurations of three identical particles and irreducible representations that the quantum numbers correspond to .",
    "these quantum numbers describe entirely symmetry properties of the spatial wavefunction .",
    "we consider that the three particles are situated at short distances from each other if the potential of interaction in each pair of the particles is much larger than the rotational energy of the relative motion .",
    "we define the short range region in this way to be able to separate vibrational and rotational motion of the system and use vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the three particles .",
    "therefore , the total wave function is written as a product of rotational @xmath42 and vibrational @xmath43 factors : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the euler angles defining orientation of the plane of the three particles in the space - fixed coordinate frame ; @xmath46 , and @xmath47 represent three independent vibrational coordinates defining relative positions of the three particles . here",
    ", we use the hyperspherical coordinates @xcite to describe the relative motion .",
    "the rotational wave function of the @xmath8 system is described by the symmetric top eigenstates @xcite : @xmath48^{1/2}\\left[d^{j}_{m , k}(\\alpha , \\beta , \\gamma)\\right]^*\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the total angular momentum of the system , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are respectively its projections on the space - fixed and molecular axes .",
    "these numbers are constants of motion of the symmetric top and sufficient to define completely the rotational state of the system .",
    "the correspondence between the quantum numbers @xmath52 and the irreducible representations of such rotational functions is summarized in table [ table : quan_nums_rot ] , which is obtained from the symmetry properties of the wigner functions @xmath53 @xcite in the @xmath8 group and from the coefficients @xmath54 of ( [ eq : projector_general ] ) .",

    ".,width=415 ]    the correlations between quantum numbers appropriate at different configurations of the three particles are derived from conservation of the symmetry , i.e. irreducible representation of the state of three particles .",
    "the possible correlations for several values of quantum numbers are summarized in figures [ fig : diag_1 ] and [ fig : diag_2 ] for total angular momentum @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "since the symmetry depends only on the quantum numbers @xmath51 and @xmath58 at small distances , on @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the non - interacting particles , and on @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the dimer+particle configuration , only these quantum numbers are specified in figures [ fig : diag_1 ] and [ fig : diag_2 ] .",
    ".,width=415 ]    with help of figures [ fig : heplot ] and [ fig:4by3wf_plot ] , we give an example of how the selection rules can be applied . figure [ fig : heplot ] shows several adiabatic hyperspherical curves for a three - body model system .",
    "such curves are obtained diagonalizing the rovibrational hamiltonian in the space of the hyperangles , treating the hyper - radius as a continuous parameter .",
    "rotational degrees of freedom ( euler angles ) are also quantized .",
    "the particular example we consider is the actual he@xmath63 potential @xcite multiplied uniformly with an factor to obtain a deeper potential well for the trimer .",
    "the origin of the energy corresponds to the energy of the three particles at infinite separation from each other . for simplicity of the discussion , we consider that the total angular momentum @xmath49 of the system is zero . therefore , the symmetry of the rotational part of the wave function is @xmath64 . in figure",
    "[ fig : heplot ] , asymptotically - large values of the hyper - radius correspond to three - free - particle configuration if the energy of the system is positive and to the dimer+particle configuration if the total energy is negative .",
    "the lowest possible energy in the asymptotic region is the energy of the dimer in the ground rovibrational state . for the considered model system ,",
    "the dimer has only one possible vibrational state @xmath65 and four rotational levels @xmath66 and 3 .    .",
    "all coordinates except the hyper - radius are quantized .",
    "since the irreducible representational is determined by the symmetry of the wave functions with respect to the ( hyper-)angles @xmath47 and @xmath67 , each curve is labeled with the index of an irreducible representation . for @xmath56 , only positive parity ( @xmath68 or @xmath16 ) is allowed.,width=415 ]",
    "the selection rules could be applied to collisions of three particles or to the decay of a quasi - bound three - body state ( half - collision ) . as an example",
    ", we consider the decay of a quasi - bound state with the total energy larger than zero . after the decay , the system may end up in the three - free - particles configuration or in the dimer+particle configuration .",
    "for example ,",
    "if the initial state has symmetry @xmath64 , the dimer+particle configuration is possible only if @xmath61 is an even number .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure [ fig : heplot ] : adiabatic curves of the @xmath64 symmetry correlate at large hyper - radii only with dissociation thresholds with @xmath69 and 2 , which is consistant with the correlation diagram shown in figure [ fig : diag_2 ] .",
    "similar analysis can be done for the @xmath16 initial state .",
    "however , @xmath16 short - range states can end up with all possible values of @xmath61 .",
    "there is no quasi - bound states of the @xmath70 symmetry for the considered three - body potential .",
    "however , if we assume having the three free particles collide in an @xmath70 initial state , after such a collision only dimers with odd angular momenta @xmath61 can be produced : @xmath70 curves in figure [ fig : heplot ] correlate only with odd @xmath61 at large distances .",
    "such initial arrangement of the three colliding identical particles can be produced experimentally , for example , in ultra - cold gas of fully polarized fermionic atoms , such as @xmath71k .     and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath5 is represented by its two components @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . here ,",
    "the parity is defined ( positive ) but we do not specify it here because it is controlled by @xmath67 , that can not be shown . in the left column",
    "the hyper - radius is @xmath74 a.u .",

    "and in the right column it is @xmath76 a.u .",
    "the wave functions are shown as contour plots depending on @xmath77 and @xmath47 : the three upper functions are shown for only two values of contour cuts : 0.5 and 0.75 ; the other functions as shown for values @xmath780.5 and @xmath781 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath77 and @xmath47 in this graph are arranged in the polar - coordinate - like way : @xmath77 plays the role of radius and @xmath43 plays the role of cyclic polar angle.,width=302 ]    as mentioned above , the irreducible representation of wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates is determined by the behavior of the functions along the hyper - angle @xmath47 and euler angle @xmath67 . in the considered example , the dependence on @xmath67 is trivial , since @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig:4by3wf_plot ] demonstrates the dependence of the wave functions on @xmath77 and @xmath47 obtained numerically for three qualitatively different hyper - radii : ( i ) short hyper - radius , where the system behaves approximately as a rigid rotor , ( ii ) the intermediate region , and ( iii ) large hyper - radius , where one can approximate the system by three non - interacting particles or the dimer+particle configuration . in the intermediate region",
    "no approximation may be applied .",
    "as it is clear from the figure , the symmetry of the wave functions is determined by a single variable @xmath47 .",
    "the binary permutations @xmath79 and @xmath80 are equivalent , respectively , to reflexions of the functions about the three axes going through the center of each plot in figure [ fig:4by3wf_plot ] at angles @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , whereas the cyclic permutations @xmath84 and @xmath85 are respectively equivalent to change of the hyperangle from @xmath47 to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we have considered the sets of quantum numbers of three indistinguishable particles for three different possible configurations : three non - interacting particles , the pair of two interacting particles and the third one being far from the pair , and finally , three interacting particles .",
    "some of the quantum numbers from the three sets are the same in the three configurations , others are appropriate only for the given configuration . during the process of collision of the three indistinguishable particles ,",
    "all three configurations are involved .",
    "the quantum numbers that are the same for the three configurations , are conserved during the collision , others are transformed .",
    "we analyzed the correspondence between quantum numbers from the three sets and derived certain selection rules between them .",
    "the selection rules for several values of the quantum numbers are schematically presented in figures [ fig : diag_1 ] and [ fig : diag_2 ] as correlation diagrams similar to the correlation diagrams derived for diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "if needed , correlation diagrams for other values of the quantum numbers can be easily obtained from tables [ table : quan_nums_rot ] , [ table : quan_nums_vib ] , [ table : quan_nums_free ] , and [ table : quan_nums_dimer ] .",
    "the derived correlation diagrams can be useful in analysis of experiments with ultra - cold degenerate atomic gases studying such processes as three - body recombination , formation and decay of three - body resonances @xcite , or thermalization of the degenerate gas .",
    "concluding , we would like to discuss briefly how the spin statistics can be included in the selection rules .",
    "treating the nuclear and electronic spin parts of the total wave function separately from the rovibrational part , we neglected the interaction of the rovibrational motion with ( electronic and/or nuclear ) spins of the particles .",
    "hence , we assumed that the spin @xmath88 hamiltonian is separable from the the rovibrational hamiltonian and the total wave function of the system is constructed as a product of the spin and spatial factors .",
    "the symmetry group of @xmath88 is the subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath8 .",
    "correspondingly , spin eigenstates transform in @xmath8 according to one of the @xmath68 or @xmath16 irreducible representations .",
    "the effect of the total spin of the system on the symmetry of total wave functions can be accounted using well - known tables of products of the @xmath8 irreducible representations .",
    "an example of relationships between nuclear spin quantum numbers and irreducible representations for the system of three identical particles is given in @xcite for the case of h@xmath89 ( spin-@xmath90 particles ) and d@xmath89 ( spin-1 particles ) .",
