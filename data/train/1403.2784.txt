    "the globular cluster rz2109 located in the galaxy ngc4472 is a known host of an accreting black hole system , first identified by @xcite .",
    "along with the variable x - ray source indicative of the accreting black hole , rz2109 has been observed to host a broad and luminous [ o  iii]@xmath54959,5007 emission line complex thought to correspond to an accretion - powered outflow driven from the cluster s black hole @xcite .",
    "the rz2109 emission line structure is unusual in many respects .",
    "the lines are very broad with a width of 3200 km s@xmath4 , about a factor of 100 larger than the escape velocity of the globular cluster in which it is located .",
    "the line velocity profiles also have a complex shape and appear to contain two distinct velocity structures @xcite",
    ". moreover , [ o  iii]@xmath54959,5007 are the only emission lines apparent even in a fairly deep spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the lack of balmer line emission , in particular , may be indicative of a hydrogen poor donor star such as a white dwarf .",
    "this possibility is significant because although bh - wd binaries are an expected end stage of stellar evolution , especially in globular clusters , none has yet been positively identified @xcite .",
    "a common diagnostic for the study of emission line regions is the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 emission line ratio .",
    "previous work by @xcite noted that [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio appeared to be at least 30 based on a low resolution optical spectrum of the rz2109 cluster . for reference other common astrophysical [ o  iii ]",
    "emission line production sites include active galactic nuclei with typical [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios of order unity @xcite , milky way planetary nebulae with mean line ratios of approximately 15 @xcite , and a few extremely hydrogen poor planetary nebulae with line ratio of  20 @xcite .",
    "based on a comparison to these sources , it seems plausible that the rz2109 emission line site would be hydrogen - depleted . on the other hand",
    ", the [ o iii ] production sites and mechanisms can be very different among astrophysical object classes and it is not immediately obvious how relevant such comparisons are .    in this work",
    "we investigate the composition of the rz2109 emission line region in order to help constrain models of the black hole / donor star binary in the globular cluster .",
    "accordingly , section [ sec : obs ] presents an analysis of higher signal - to - noise spectra of rz2109 than have been previously used to explore the composition of the source . in section",
    "[ sec : ar ] , we begin by modeling the stellar component of the rz2109 spectrum to remove the stellar contributions from the emission line measurements . the next section presents the line measurement results .",
    "section [ sec : rtm ] presents results from a suite of radiative models that we use to interpret the range of [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 emission line ratios .",
    "the last section of the paper includes a discussion of the overall results of this analysis .",
    "the optical spectra used in this study were collected using the gemini multi object spectrograph ( gmos ) on the gemini south telescope .",
    "these data , first presented in @xcite , were taken on the consecutive nights of ut 2009 march 2829 ( program gs-2009a - q-1 ) . the medium resolution spectra ( r @xmath6 )",
    "have a wavelength coverage from 44456023  .",
    "the data were reduced using the longslit tools in the gemini iraf package . one dimensional spectra were extracted from the processed spectra and , following tests to ensure the emission line object was not varying between nights @xcite , co - added to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .    the resulting reduced spectrum is a superposition of the emission line source of interest and the stellar component of the host globular cluster . in order to examine the emission line source in isolation , the stellar component must be modeled and removed .",
    "the modeling of the stellar component was performed in a process similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the rz2109 gemini spectrum was fit to a grid of continuum normalized synthetic spectra constructed using the pegas - hr code of @xcite and elodie 3.1 @xcite stellar library .",
    "a kroupa imf @xcite was adopted along with a single epoch of star formation to construct the synthetic stellar population grid using cluster age and initial metallicity as free parameters . to avoid emission lines contaminating the fit with the inclusion of emission lines with non - stellar origins",
    ", the region between 48705060   in the observed frame ( 48465035   rest frame ) was masked out to exclude contributions from h@xmath2 and [ o  iii]@xmath05007 to the @xmath7 minimization fitting scheme .",
    "the resulting best - fit stellar model corresponded to an age of 13.25 gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -1.0 .",
    "the best - fitting synthetic stellar population model provides , qualitatively , an excellent match to the stellar component of the observed spectrum of rz2109 .",
    "figure [ fig : stellar ] provides a comparison between the observed spectrum and the best - fit model over the entire spectral wavelength range , along with an inset showing the h@xmath2 region in detail .    in order to determine the uncertainties in the fitted parameters ,",
    "simulated observations were performed by constructing a best - fit synthetic stellar component spectrum and injecting noise to match the signal - to - noise of the observations .",
    "the simulated observation was then fit to produce a new set of stellar parameters .",
    "this simulated observation process was performed for 10@xmath8 iterations with the resultant probability density distribution of the stellar component parameter fits shown in figure [ fig : sig ] . from this exercise it is evident that the fit is well constrained in [ fe / h ] , while displaying a greater spread in the age parameter .",
    "some of the observed spread in age results from the exclusion of h@xmath2 , the feature most sensitive to age , in the fitting scheme .",
    "the log scale used for the stellar parameter density distribution in figure [ fig : sig ] may overemphasize the spread in age ; only 1 percent of the simulated observations had age determinations below 5.75 gyr and only 10 percent were below 8.50 gyr .",
    "the adopted stellar parameters and associated uncertainties ( age @xmath9 gyr , [ fe / h ] @xmath10 ) include 83 percent of all simulated observations in age and 98 percent in metallicity .",
    "the emission line s equivalent widths ( ew ) are measured by direct integration of the continuum normalized spectrum bounded by a given velocity aperture . a second measurement is then performed over the identical aperture on the stellar model and the value subtracted from the data measurement in order to remove the influence of stellar absorption features .",
    "given the complexity of the [ o  iii]@xmath05007 line profile the specification of the velocity aperture is non - trivial .",
    "@xcite find that the [ o  iii]@xmath05007 emission line in rz2109 is well described by two components ; a broad component with a width at zero intensity of @xmath11 kms@xmath4 and narrower component with a fwhm of @xmath12 kms@xmath4 . here",
    "we perform measurements for apertures of two widths which correspond to the two components identified by @xcite ; a broad 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture and a 600 kms@xmath4 aperture . for reference",
    "the apertures over which the measurements are performed are plotted for the h@xmath2 and [ o  iii]@xmath05007 lines in figure [ fig : aps ] .",
    "table [ tab : ew ] gives the resulting measurements for [ o  iii]@xmath05007 and h@xmath2 in both the 3200 and 600 kms@xmath4 apertures .",
    "the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 emission line ratios for each velocity aperture are very large ( 105.7 for the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture , 61.6 for the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture ) , notably larger than found in previous measurements using lower signal - to - noise data @xcite .",
    "this increase in the emission line ratios may be attributable solely to the higher signal - to - noise of the current data providing lower h@xmath2 measurement uncertainties , and therefore higher line ratios , rather than a change in the line luminosities of the source .",
    "the cited 1@xmath13 uncertainties provide an estimate of the rms uncertainties derived from the local continuum and poisson statistic uncertainties for emission above the local continuum . to construct an estimate of the local continuum rms two regions , one blueward , one redward , with a width equal to that of the measurement aperture",
    "were evaluated to find the mean expected deviations from the local continuum .",
    "the second uncertainty cited for the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture h@xmath2 measurement reflects the uncertainty produced by the fit of the synthetic stellar population model .",
    "this uncertainty estimate was produced by injecting noise consistent with that of the observations into a synthetic stellar model with parameters matching the best - fit model , refitting the resulting spectrum with a new stellar model using the procedure described in section [ sec : sm ] , and remeasuring the h@xmath2 ew .",
    "the contours plotted in figure [ fig : sig ] display the h@xmath2 ew as a function of the stellar component parameters .",
    "the unit label for each contour is given as a multiple of the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture ew measurement of the best - fit stellar parameter model .",
    "considering the full stellar parameter space covered by the simulated observations detailed in section [ sec : sm ] , the mean h@xmath2 ew of the simulated observations is two percent greater than the cited value for the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture of @xmath14  , with 58 percent of the iterations falling within 10 percent and 89 percent of iterations within 20 percent of the cited value .",
    "if we limit consideration to only those simulated observations located within the uncertainty bounds of the best - fit stellar parameters , the mean h@xmath2 ew is one percent less than the cited value , 66 percent of iterations are within 10 percent of the cited value and all simulated observations are within 20 percent .",
    "therefore an uncertainty in the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture h@xmath2 ew measurement of 20 percent is adopted .",
    "the uncertainty estimates of the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 emission line ratios are dominated by uncertainties in the h@xmath2 measurement . for small values of h@xmath2",
    "the discontinuity in the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios , [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 goes to infinity as h@xmath2 goes to zero , complicates the interpretation of uncertainties expressed in the conventional format .",
    "for example , the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture emission line ratio is 105.7@xmath15 . for clarity",
    "it is helpful to consider the uncertainties of the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio in terms of limits at set confidence intervals , as expressed in figure [ tab : lim ] .",
    "further discussion of these limits and there interpretation is included in section [ sec : dc ] .",
    "it should be noted that ratios of emission line ew are not always directly comparable to ratios of emission line fluxes .",
    "ews are measured relative to the local continuum level , thus two emission lines with equal flux values will only have equal ew values if the continuum level is the same at each lines observed wavelength . in the case of rz2109 measurements of the flux calibrated continuum at the observed line - center of [ o",
    "iii]@xmath05007 and h@xmath2 differ by @xmath16 percent , indicating that the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ew ratio is functionally equivalent ( within measurement uncertainties ) to a flux ratio .",
    "additional measurements were performed for a selection of other emission lines which the synthetic spectral modeling of section [ sec : rtm ] suggested may be present with ew a significant fraction of that of h@xmath2 .",
    "these measurements were performed with a 600 kms@xmath4 aperture on he  ii@xmath04686 ( ew@xmath17 ) , [ ar  iv]@xmath04740 ( ew@xmath18 ) , and [ fe  vii]@xmath05721 ( ew@xmath19 ) . the uncertainties for these measurements reflect 1 sigma rms deviations from the continuum , determined as describe above for the [ o  iii]@xmath05007 and h@xmath2 measurements . it should be noted that other than [ o  iii]@xmath05007 and the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture h@xmath2 ew ( which is a very weak detection ) , all ew for both 3200 and 600 kms@xmath4 apertures are consistent with non - detections .    as the two emission components are thought to be produced in spatially and geometrically distinct structures , the emission line ratios derived using the two apertures need not be the same .",
    "since the contributions of the broad and narrow emission components are superimposed , both the 3200 kms@xmath4 or 600 kms@xmath4 aperture measurements reflect an ew with contributions from both sources . in the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture",
    "the broad component dominates the ew , while the narrow component dominates in the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture measurements . for reference",
    ", @xcite find that 81 percent of the total [ o  iii]@xmath05007 flux is contributed by the broad component and the remainder by the narrow component , though it should be noted deconvolving these contribution is necessarily a model - dependent calculation .      in order to test the possibility that the measured [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 emission line ratios given above might be produced by a gas of solar composition",
    ", a series of radiative transfer models was constructed .",
    "the models were executed using version 08.01 of the cloudy spectral synthesis code from @xcite .",
    "the suite of models tested all had solar compositions and spherically symmetric shell gas distributions characterized by an inner and outer radius .",
    "the gas was assumed to be outflowing at a velocity of 300 kms@xmath4 at the inner radius .",
    "the gas was gradually accelerated by radiation pressure from the x - ray source , increasing the velocity by a few percent at the outer radius . under the prescription of an outflowing gas cloudy",
    "adjusts the density to conserve mass flux ( defined as the quantity @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gas density , @xmath22 is the velocity , and @xmath23 the radius ) at each radius .",
    "the gas was irradiated by bremsstrahlung emission from a central source at 10@xmath24 k , and normalized to match the x - ray luminosity observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "parameter space was then explored along the dimensions of the the inner radius ( @xmath25 ) , hydrogen density at the inner radius ( @xmath26 ) , and the total mass of the outflow . the free parameter space included in the model grid",
    "is summarized in table [ tab : cmg ] .",
    "for each outflow mass range the limits on the inner radius and hydrogen density were selected to ensure the maximum [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio model was surround by closed emission line ratio contours in parameter space .",
    "this criteria ensured that the maximum line ratio model identified at each outflow mass was a maximum in the local parameter space and not limited by the selection of boundary conditions .",
    "as an example of the resultant model space for one specific outflow mass , figure [ fig : cloudy]a displays the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 emission line ratios for a model with a 0.2 @xmath27 outflow as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . considering the case of a 0.2 @xmath27 outflow allows us to investigate an interesting limit , since this is the minimum solar composition gas mass that can provide the @xmath28 @xmath27 of oxygen required to reproduce the observed [ o  iii ] emission @xcite .",
    "for this 0.2 @xmath27 outflow a maximum emission line ratio of 26 occurs at @xmath29 cm and @xmath30 gm @xmath31 .",
    "the emission line ratio rises gradually with increased outflow mass reaching a maximum of [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath32 near @xmath33 as seen in figure [ fig : cloudy]b .",
    "the maximum emission line ratio for a range of outflow masses is given in figure [ fig : mvr ] .",
    "the transition point in the maximum emission line ratio - mass ratio seen at a mass of @xmath34 g ( @xmath35 @xmath27 ) occurs due to a change in the geometric distribution of the emitting gas that maximizes [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 . for masses below the @xmath34 g threshold",
    "the optimal arrangement involves locating the gas in a thin shell ( @xmath36 ) at a density which allows maximum [ o  iii]@xmath05007 emission across the shell . above the threshold mass",
    "the optimal gas configuration is of a thicker distribution ( @xmath37 ) and the [ o  iii]@xmath05007 emission is generated over a broad region located primarily in the half of the gas distribution most distant from the ionizing source . for reference in a recent study @xcite find a half - light radius of 4 - 6 pc for the rz2109 [ o  iii]@xmath05007 source , a few times greater than the outer radius producible by any solar composition model .    to evaluate the sensitivity of the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio on the input x - ray source temperature",
    ", a second model grid was calculated employing a higher temperature source . for an x - ray source temperature of @xmath38",
    "k , the behavior of the maximum emission line ratio as a function of mass is largely similar to the @xmath39 k case described above .",
    "the transition point seen produced by the shift in the optimal gas configuration occurs at a lower mass of @xmath40 g , and the maximum [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio of @xmath41 occurs near 30 @xmath27 . over",
    "the range of masses evaluated the higher temperature x - ray source produces line ratios 1520 percent greater than the corresponding lower temperature model .    the outflow velocity of 300 kms@xmath4 was selected to be broadly consistent with the observed 600 kms@xmath4 feature , as the full observed width is produced by the superposition of approaching and receding flows . increasing the velocity to 1600 kms@xmath4 to match the observed boarder feature produces a minimal change in the resulting [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio ; on order of a few thousandths of a percent .",
    "from the ew measurements presented in section [ sec : ew ] it is clear that any h@xmath2 emission which may be present in the observed rz2109 spectrum is extremely weak .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is sufficiently weak to make interpretation of the resulting [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 line ratios difficult .",
    "if taken at face value these ratios are among the largest detected from any astrophysical source @xcite . in table [ tab : lim ] the confidence levels for the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio are given based on the uncertainty in the h@xmath2 measurement .",
    "equivalent width measurements below the level of the continuum ( absorption features for example ) are indicated with negative equivalent width value .",
    "therefore a negative line ratio limit in table [ tab : lim ] indicates that the h@xmath2 measurement is consistent with an absorption line at the specified confidence level .",
    "when the full velocity width covered by the [ o  iii]@xmath05007 complex is considered along with the radiative transfer modeling presented in section [ sec : rtm ] it is clear that a solar composition gas is insufficient to produce the observed [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios .",
    "the measured ratio using 3200 kms@xmath4 apertures is nearly a factor of three larger than the maximum ratios produced by the synthetic emission line models . at the @xmath42 confidence level for the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture and the @xmath43 confidence level for the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture the uncertainty limits on the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio approach the maximum synthetic [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 values .",
    "these ratio limits are 35.7 at 3200 km  s@xmath4 , and 33.0 at 600 kms@xmath4 compared to the synthetic maximum of 34 . as such it may be possible to produce the necessary [ o",
    "iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio for either aperture given an emission line region model that falls in a very specific location is physical parameter space .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the gas masses required to produce the maximum synthetic [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 values are well above what might be expected to be associated with an accreting black hole in a globular cluster . in order to produce the maximum synthetic [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios a total gas mass of order 100 m@xmath44",
    "is needed which would eliminate x - ray binaries , planetary nebulae , supernovae remnants , or any other stellar scale objects as the source of the emitting gas . to reach a gas mass of that size a significant portion of the gas",
    "would necessarily be contributed by the cluster s interstellar medium .",
    "however the hydrogen densities involved in producing the maximum synthetic [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios are of order 10@xmath4510@xmath8 @xmath31 , orders of magnitude above the expected densities of a cluster interstellar medium .",
    "furthermore , the 10@xmath4 solar composition of an interstellar medium would produce lower [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios in comparison to the solar composition models considered above , making a large contribution of ism material to the emission line region unlikely .",
    "more typical gas masses produce maximum ratios a factor of four times smaller than those observed in the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture and nearly twice that of the lower limit of the 600 kms@xmath4 measurement .",
    "the rz2109 emission line region therefore appears to be oxygen enriched relative to solar composition .",
    "the level of oxygen enrichment necessary to produce the observed [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 is not readily apparent , as the emission line systems physical parameters are not well constrained by observation .",
    "however , it is possible to examine some interesting limits by calculating the affect of carbon and oxygen enrichment for two characteristic masses ; 1.0 m@xmath44 representing a stellar source of the emitting gas , and 0.1 m@xmath44 representing the outflow from a co white dwarf and black hole binary .",
    "a grid of cloudy models , as described in section 3.3 , was run for each characteristic mass with carbon and oxygen enriched from solar composition to 100 times solar . from this calculation",
    "we find a minimum co enrichment of 17.8 times solar is necessary for the 1.0 m@xmath44 model to yield [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratios equivalent to the measured values of the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture and 5.5 times solar to match the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture .",
    "for the 0.1 m@xmath44 model the gas must be enriched to 17.2 times solar for the 3200 kms@xmath4 aperture and 5.6 times solar to match the 600 kms@xmath4 aperture .",
    "we must emphasize that these are only lower limits on co enrichment for two interesting astrophysical systems , and are not necessarily indicative of enrichment of the rz2109 emission line source .",
    "@xcite present the argument that the complex line [ o  iii ] velocity profile observed in the rz2109 spectrum is consistent with emission originating from two discrete gas structures .",
    "the two velocity apertures presented in this work do not directly correspond to the two geometric components discussed by @xcite as emission from the two components are superimposed in velocity space . from a comparison of the measured [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 line ratios and synthetic line ratio considered here it seems most likely that both the gas structures are comprised of oxygen enriched material .",
    "for the higher velocity structure which @xcite describes as a bipolar conical outflow this is consistent with the scenario of material being stripped from a co white dwarf companion to the black hole , and driven to the observed velocity as an accretion - powered outflow .",
    "the added constraint of being oxygen enriched , does not , however place obvious constraints on the gas source for the lower velocity component .",
    "as evidenced by the calculations summarized in figure [ fig : mvr ] , the geometry of the emission region strongly influences the emission line ratios that it produces .",
    "as such the [ o  iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath2 ratio alone is insufficient to fully constrain the gas composition of the rz2109 emission line system , or to positively identify the particular stellar type of the x - ray binary s donor star .",
    "the wd donor star model is consistent with all the observations and calculations presented above .",
    "however we are not yet able to fully rule out other late stage or polluted stellar types with super - solar abundance atmospheres as the source for the observed outflow . with future observations of other spectral bands , including measurements of uv carbon lines",
