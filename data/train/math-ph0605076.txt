    "self - avoiding polygons are ( images of ) simple closed curves on the square lattice .",

    "serve as a model of two - dimensional vesicles , where the vesicle pressure is conjugate to the polygon area @xcite . despite the long history of the problem",
    "( see @xcite for reviews ) , there is not much exact , let alone rigorous knowledge .",
    "recent progress comes from two different directions .",
    "it appears that stochastic methods , combined with ideas of conformal invariance , describe a number of fractal curves appearing in various models of statistical physics , including self - avoiding polygons @xcite .",
    "this will not further be discussed in this article .",
    "another line of research consists in analysing solvable subclasses of self - avoiding polygons .",
    "such classes of polygons have been studied for a long time and by different people , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein for ( subclasses of ) column - convex polygons . in this article , we will concentrate on one such subclass , the class of staircase polygons .",
    "the perimeter generating function of staircase polygons has been given by levine @xcite and by plya @xcite , the width and area generating function has been given by klarner and rivest @xcite and by bender @xcite , the perimeter and area generating function of this model has been given by brak and guttmann @xcite , lin and tseng @xcite , bousquet - mlou and viennot @xcite , prellberg and brak @xcite , and by bousquet - mlou @xcite , using various solution methods .    of particular interest to the melbourne group of statistical mechanics and combinatorics is the critical behaviour of such models , in particular their critical exponents and scaling functions . for staircase polygons , counted by perimeter and area ,",
    "these quantities had been obtained in 1995 @xcite . on the basis of the numerical observation that rooted self - avoiding polygons , counted by perimeter and area ,",
    "have the same critical exponents as staircase polygons , tony guttmann raised the question @xcite whether their scaling functions , which describe the vesicle collapse transition , might be the same .",
    "one of the implications of this conjecture concerns the asymptotic distribution of polygon area in a uniform model , where polygons of fixed perimeter occur with equal weight .",
    "this distribution was tested for by self - avoiding polygon data from exact enumeration and found to be satisfied to a high degree of numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "a field - theoretic justification for the form of the scaling function was then given by cardy @xcite .",
    "later , other implications of the scaling function conjecture relating to the asymptotic distribution of perimeter at criticality and to the crossover behaviour were found to be satisfied , within numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "one might thus be tempted to conclude that critical self - avoiding polygons and critical staircase polygons lie in the same universality class .",
    "then , one should expect that also distributions of parameters different from the area should coincide for both models .",
    "investigating the implications of this idea is one of the aims of this article .",
    "we thus re - analyse staircase polygons , which we count by a number of parameters generalising the area . in so doing ,",
    "we adopt the viewpoint of analytic combinatorics @xcite , thereby highlighting connections to statistical physics and to a probabilistic description . for example",
    ", staircase polygons are in one - to - one correspondence to dyck paths @xcite , see figure [ fig : pol ] for an illustration and below for definitions .    in turn ,",
    "dyck paths are classical objects of enumerative combinatorics @xcite , which are asymptotically described by brownian excursions .",
    "this connection is described at various places in the literature , see e.g. @xcite . moreover ,",
    "dyck paths are closely related to models of trees @xcite , as indicated in figure [ fig : tree ] .    in fact , the generating functions of polygon models , models of ( simply generated ) trees , and models of paths satisfy similar functional equations , typically leading to limit distributions of the same type .",
    "more generally , it appears that limit distributions for counting parameters are irrelevant of many details of the functional equation .",
    "this phenomenon of universality has recently been investigated using the setup of @xmath1-functional equations @xcite and extends previous results @xcite by including counting parameters which generalise the polygon area .",
    "the results in @xcite were obtained by an interplay between methods from statistical physics , combinatorics and stochastics .",
    "corresponding counting parameters appeared previously within a combinatorial setup , see duchon @xcite and nguy@xmath2n th@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the derivation of moment recurrences of limit distributions for these parameters is inspired by the method of dominant balance as used by prellberg and brak @xcite in polygon statistical physics , and some results for the corresponding stochastic objects appear to be unknown in the stochastics literature .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows .",
    "we first derive a functional equation for the generating function of staircase polygons , counted by perimeter and sums of @xmath0-th powers of lengths of diagonals , @xmath0 being a positive integer .",
    "we also analyse a corresponding quantity for column heights .",
    "we then derive limit distributions for the above counting parameters in the limit of large perimeter , resp .  width .",
    "we will first review the case @xmath4 , which serves as a preparation for the following section , where the case of general @xmath0 is discussed .",
    "we then investigate the question of universality of our results by comparing them to monte - carlo simulations of self - avoiding polygons .",
    "the simulations indicate that the considered parameters have different laws for self - avoiding polygons and for staircase polygons .",
    "the methods discussed in this paper can be applied to similar problems concerning models of walks and models of trees .",
    "this we indicate for various models of discrete walks related to dyck paths , such as meanders and bridges .",
    "the analysis extends previous work @xcite , where mainly the case @xmath5 is studied .",
    "consider two fully directed walks on the edges of the square lattice ( i.e. , walks stepping only up or right ) , which both start at the origin and end in the same vertex , but have no other vertex in common . the edge set of such a configuration",
    "is called a _ staircase polygon _ , if it is nonempty .",
    "each staircase polygon is a self - avoiding polygon . for a given staircase polygon ,",
    "consider the construction of moving the upper directed walk one unit down and one unit to the right .",
    "for each walk , remove its first and its last edge .",
    "the resulting object is a sequence of ( horizontal and vertical ) edges and staircase polygons , see figure [ fig : rem ] .",
    "the unit square yields the empty sequence .    using this construction , it is easy to see that the set of staircase polygons @xmath6 is in one - to - one correspondence with the set @xmath7 of ordered sequences of edges and staircase polygons",
