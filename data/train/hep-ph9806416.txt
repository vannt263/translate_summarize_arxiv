    "one of the most important aspects of hadronic dynamics at low energies is spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . indeed , when considering just the two lightest quarks as massless , there is a spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 down to @xmath1 ( isospin ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the nambu - goldstone bosons associated with that breaking , namely the pions , become the relevant degrees of freedom at low energies . in the last years",
    "a general formalism called chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has been developed @xcite , which exploits the chiral symmetry constraints , providing a phenomenological description of low - energy pion dynamics , organized as an expansion in the pion external momenta and masses ( the latter appear due to the small explicit chiral symmetry breaking caused by quark masses ) . by using chpt",
    "it is possible to describe at low energies a large number of processes , such as pion scattering , in terms of a small set of parameters which can be fixed from experimental data .    at high temperatures",
    "it is expected that chiral symmetry will be restored at some critical temperature , @xmath2 , typically around a few hundred mev .",
    "nevertheless , below @xmath2 the main excitations of the hadronic medium would be long wavelength pions or , in other words , one should deal with a hot pionic gas @xcite .",
    "as is well known , finite temperature effects can be included in quantum field theory ( qft ) in different ways ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular this is the case in chpt , where the imaginary time formalism was used to calculate the pion gas free energy as a power expansion in the temperature over the pion decay constant , @xmath3 , up to @xmath4 @xcite . as a matter of fact , the thermodynamics of the pion gas has also been the subject of intense work using finite temperature qcd sum rules @xcite and other alternative approaches @xcite . among other issues ,",
    "some of these calculations made it possible to obtain some @xmath2 estimates . in this work",
    "we will consider the interacting pionic gas , but using a different method which can be applied at higher temperatures and including density effects as well .",
    "those effects are well known to be relevant in the study of the behavior of hadronic matter . in particular , once they are included in the pion gas state equation they modify the critical temperature .    the approach that we will follow here relies on the use of the relativistic virial expansion developed a long time ago @xcite",
    "such an expansion will allow us to obtain the relevant thermal functions in terms of the @xmath5 matrix , so that it is not necessary to go through the technicalities of finite temperature qft . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is even possible to start from an @xmath5 matrix obtained directly from experiment , without using any qft .",
    "the other key point in our approach is based on the unitarity of the @xmath5 matrix .",
    "the standard way to consider density in statistical physics is by introducing a grand canonical ensemble , whose chemical potential should be coupled to some conserved quantum number . in the case of the pion gas ,",
    "the only conserved quantities are the electric charge and the baryonic number .",
    "in particular , the total number of pions is not conserved by strong interactions . however , from pion scattering data it is well known that elastic unitarity is satisfied up to energies of about 1 gev ( where the inelastic @xmath6 channel opens up , since the four pion channel contribution is negligible at those energies ) . therefore ,",
    "if one is only interested in low energy pion dynamics or low pion gas temperatures , it is sensible to assume that the pion number is approximately conserved by strong interactions . in this way it is possible to introduce the corresponding chemical potential and a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "thus the pion density , or the number of pions per unit of volume , becomes a meaningful physical concept , at least for temperatures well below 1 gev .    by using the approach described above we",
    "will obtain the pion gas state equation for low densities and temperatures below @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , for a given density , we will estimate this critical temperature as that where the quark condensate vanishes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.2",
    "we introduce the details of the virial expansion and discuss in detail the free gas case , including the possibility of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "in addition , the comparison with the free gas will provide an estimate of the range of applicability of the virial expansion up to the second virial coefficient .",
    "in sec.3 we show our results for the state equation of the real pion gas , i.e. we obtain the pressure versus the density and the temperature . in this case",
    "the second virial coefficient is computed both using the phase shifts that are obtained from standard chpt as well as those using an inverse amplitude method ( iam ) fit to pion data up to about 1 gev . in sec.4 we obtain the quark condensate also in terms of the temperature and the density .",
    "this will make possible to obtain an approximate phase diagram for the pion gas .",
    "finally , in sec.5 we list the main conclusions of this work .",
    "let us start by considering a pion gas consisting of @xmath7 different pion species ( for example @xmath8 for the @xmath0 case ) .",
    "the pressure virial expansion can be written as @xcite @xmath9 where , as usual , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the pion mass , @xmath12 is the thermal de broglie wavelength and , according to our previous discussion , @xmath13 is the chemical potential associated with the total number of pions .",
    "note that the expansion parameter is the fugacity @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "as is well known , the limit @xmath15 corresponds to the low - density regime where the virial expansion is expected to work .",
    "the density @xmath16 of the pion gas , i.e. the number @xmath16 of pions per unit of volume can be obtained from @xmath17 the state equation of the system can be obtained by replacing the chemical potential in eq.[pvir ] by its expression in terms of temperature and density that we can obtain from eq.[nfromp ] .      in order to illustrate the above formalism we will consider first the free - pion gas",
    ". this will be interesting for different reasons : first it is the simplest case and , as far as it can be treated exactly , it will provide a very nice test for the virial expansion .",
    "in particular we will be able to estimate the range of temperatures and densities at which it can be safely applied up to the second virial coefficient .",
    "second , due to the weinberg low - energy theorems , pions are weakly interacting at low energies and thus the free pion gas can be a reasonable approximation to the real pion gas in such regime",
    ". finally , let us remember that a free boson gas can suffer a bose - einstein condensation at very low - temperatures .",
    "apart from the interest that this phase has by itself , we will see that it basically determines the applicability region of the virial expansion .",
    "thus , the free - pion gas pressure can be written as @xmath18 \\label{pfree}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the energy of a relativistic pion in terms of the pion momentum , @xmath20 .",
    "the above equation can be expanded in powers of the fugacity as @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{g\\ , t}{2\\pi^2}\\int^{\\infty}_{0}dp\\ ; p^2 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\xi^k \\frac{e^{-k \\beta ( e(p)-m_{\\pi})}}{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , comparing with eq.[pvir ] , we get @xmath22 where the superscript @xmath23 indicates that we are referring to the free gas case",
    ". then the first two virial coefficients are given by @xmath24 notice that , in the low - temperature limit , they satisfy @xmath25 by using eq.2 and eq.4 we can obtain the density @xmath26 now we can study the free - pion gas , both using the exact results , or the ( second order ) virial expansion and then compare the results .",
    "in that way we expect to get an estimate of the applicability range of the virial expansion .",
    "first of all , it is intuitively clear that we need @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we can not use the virial expansion at @xmath27 , which is precisely when bose - einstein condensation occurs .",
    "let us briefly study this regime .      in eq.[pfree ]",
    "the ground state contribution was not taken into account , although it is well known that it plays an essential role at very low temperatures .",
    "indeed , eq.[pfree ] should be rewritten as @xmath28 -\\frac{t}{v}\\log\\left[1-e^{\\beta(\\mu - m_{\\pi})}\\right ] \\label{pbe}\\ ] ] and the density as @xmath29 where the last term is the number of pions with zero momentum per unit of volume , which form the so called bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we thus define @xmath30 let us now remember that for eqs.[pbe ] and [ nbe ] to make sense , the chemical potential should satisfy @xmath31 . as a consequence , in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath32 with @xmath33 constant , we find two phases : if @xmath31 , @xmath34 .",
    "but if we lower the temperature , keeping a fixed density , @xmath13 increases until @xmath35 . at that point @xmath36 and",
    "the ground state density starts to grow , forming the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "eventually , at @xmath37 , all pions are in the ground state so that @xmath38 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath2 , where the phase transition occurs , can be obtained numerically from eq.[n0 ] .",
    "bose - einstein condensation in the free - pion gas : a ) evolution of the ground state partial density ( @xmath39 ) with the temperature for a total density of @xmath40 pion per cubic fermi .",
    "b ) phase diagram .",
    "we plot the critical temperature as a function of the density .    in fig.1a",
    "we show the ground state partial density , defined as @xmath39 , versus the temperature .",
    "for illustrative purposes we have chosen a total density @xmath41 . by using the landau theory of phase transitions @xcite ,",
    "it has been shown that in our case they are of second order @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that @xmath2 depends on the density . using eq.[n0 ] ,",
    "we have plotted in fig.1b the critical temperature versus the density . that is the bose - einstein condensation phase diagram of the pion gas .",
    "let us then recall that in the condensed phase , @xmath27 , which means that @xmath42 , and therefore , we _ can not _ apply the virial expansion .      in practice",
    ", we will be using the second order virial expansion , and we would like to know where it yields an accurate result .",
    "we have just seen that , simply because @xmath42 , there is a range of temperatures and densities where we can not use the virial approach .",
    "but the expansion could still be poor for values of @xmath43 , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "in fig.2a we show , in the @xmath45 plane , the error in the pressure obtained with the second order virial expansion compared with the exact calculation using eq.[pfree ] .",
    "notice that the error is less than @xmath46 if we keep @xmath47 and temperatures lower than 10 mev .",
    "a similar plot can be obtained for the density .",
    ".3 cm     second order virial expansion applicability range : a ) in the @xmath45 plane , within the black area corresponds to points where the virial expansion of the pressure has less than @xmath48 error , the grey area stands for less than @xmath46 error , whereas white is more than @xmath46 .",
    "b ) applicability region of the virial approach in the @xmath49 plane and the density ( defined as less than @xmath46 error with respect to the exact calculation ) .",
    "we will see in the following sections that the uncertainties in the interacting pion gas are of the order of @xmath50 . hence , throughout this work we are considering an error smaller than @xmath46 error , both in the pressure and the density , as a valid approximation . following that criteria , we plot in fig.2b the estimated validity region of the second order virial approach .",
    "notice that the invalid region is basically that where bose - einstein condensation occurs ( compare fig.2b with fig.1b ) .",
    "in this section we will apply the virial expansion to the interacting pion gas . since the second virial coefficient is the first one sensible to the interactions we have to keep , at least , up to the second term in the virial expansion .",
    "that contribution can be written in terms of the @xmath51 elastic scattering phase shifts @xmath52 as @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the modified bessel function with asymptotic behavior @xmath55 for large @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to notice that in eq.[bint ] we could simply use the experimental phase shifts , without any reference to any underlying physical theory . in this way we can compute quantities as the pressure or the density , which is enough to obtain the state equation .",
    "but we could not calculate their derivatives with respect to , for instance , the pion mass , which is needed to study the @xmath57 condensate .",
    "therefore , in this work we will obtain the phase shifts with two different approaches : on the one hand , we will use chpt to @xmath58 , with the parameters proposed in @xcite which fits the experimental data on elastic pion scattering for the @xmath59 channels , up to energies of the order of 0.5 gev .",
    "the interest of using chpt relies on the fact that it yields a systematic expansion in terms of the external momenta and masses of the pions .",
    "that will be extremely relevant in order to obtain other thermodynamic properties that may require derivatives with respect to the masses .",
    "that is indeed the case of the chiral condensate , that will be treated in the next section . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the chpt fits to pion scattering can be extended to higher energies using the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) .",
    "indeed , it yields remarkably good fits up to approximately 1 gev . that could help to obtain a better estimate of the pressure , and the equation of state ,",
    "although maybe not of its derivative with respect to the pion mass .    moreover , as far as we will be interested in temperatures @xmath60 , the bessel function in eq.[bint ] will suppress the @xmath61 contributions at high energies .",
    "thus we can also use the iam phase shifts to estimate how big is the error on the pure chpt results due to these higher energy contributions .",
    "however , note that , as far as both methods reproduce pretty well the experimental data at low energies , our results concerning the state equation of the pion gas a low temperatures can be considered as quite realistic independently of the fact that we have used chpt or the iam .",
    "thus , from the phase - shifts coming from standard chpt and from chpt complemented with the iam method , together with eqs.[virfree ] and [ bint ] we can obtain the second virial coefficient . using eq.[pvir ]",
    "we can therefore compute the value of the pressure as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath13 .",
    "we show the results in fig.3 .",
    "in particular , we plot the pressure dependence on the temperature for @xmath63 , which is well within the applicability range of the virial approach ( this case is interesting since it corresponds to the canonical ensemble @xcite ) .",
    "one of the three curves is the free - pion gas and the other two the interacting case both using standard chpt or chpt with the iam .",
    ".2 cm     the pressure of an interacting pion gas as a function of the temperature .",
    "we plot the curves both for the phase shifts obtained from pure chpt as well as with the iam , together with that of the free pion gas , as a reference .",
    "moreover , by solving numerically eq.[nfromp ] we can obtain @xmath13 in terms of the density @xmath16 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus we can finally compute the pressure as a function of the temperature and the density , @xmath64 , i.e. we obtain the state equation for a pion gas with realistic interactions . in figs.4a and 4b",
    "we show a three dimensional plot of the state equation surface , for standard chpt and the iam , respectively . as we have already discussed in the previous section , there are parts of the @xmath49 space that we can not explore within the virial approach and have been left blank . out of that area , we can trust the virial expansion . nevertheless we expect to find some differences depending on whether we complement chpt with the iam or not , which should become bigger at higher temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , it can be noticed that the numerical difference between fig . 4a and 4b , is of the order of @xmath46 at @xmath65 mev and @xmath66 . as we are going to be interested in temperatures below 300 mev",
    ", it seems that standard chpt yields a state equation with sufficient accuracy .",
    "1.5 cm     state equation for an interacting pion gas .",
    "the blank area is out of the applicability reach of the virial approximation .",
    "we plot the pressure as a function of temperature and density : a ) using standard chpt phase shifts .",
    "b ) complementing chpt with the iam .",
    "let us remark that we are strictly using an @xmath67 model and therefore we do not have other light particles , like kaons or etas , present . in a realistic gas , the effect of these other particles should also be taken into account , although it is suppressed by boltzmann factors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is also possible to apply the virial formalism to a gas with different species .",
    "the phase shifts can also be obtained from a generalization of the iam @xcite , which fits the existing data up to 1.2 gev and provides predictions when data are not available .",
    "such calculations could indicate the time scale at which the approximation of pion number conservation is valid .",
    "however , although the present approach can be generalized to include such extensions , they are beyond our present scope .",
    "once we have delimited the applicability constraints of standard chpt with the virial expansion , we will use it in the next section to study the chiral transition and the quark condensate .",
    "one of the topics of hadronic physics which has not completely been settled concerns the chiral phase transition . at some critical temperature",
    "it is expected that the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is restored giving rise to a new phase .",
    "the nature of that phase is not known but it has been argued that the transition itself is of second order for the @xmath68 case @xcite , at least in the chiral limit , or very soft first order , i.e. with a very small latent heat @xcite .    however , since the broken phase occurs at low temperatures , it should be mostly made out of pions .",
    "hence , a better understanding of the pion gas may be a useful approach to study the chiral transition .",
    "indeed , the broken phase is characterized by a non - vanishing order parameter , which is usually identified with the quark condensate @xmath69 .",
    "following @xcite , it can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath3 is basically the pion decay constant without @xmath58 corrections , m is the @xmath71 and @xmath72 averaged mass , and @xmath73 for our calculations we have taken the numerical values considered in @xcite , namely , @xmath74 and @xmath75 mev .    in order to compute the quark condensate , and following the arguments of previous sections , we will only use the standard chpt phase shifts .",
    "they seem accurate enough for our purposes up to the relevant temperatures and , at the same time , they have the appropriate @xmath11 dependence , which is essential in eq.[cucu ] .",
    ".3 cm     evolution of the chiral condensate with the temperature at @xmath63 .",
    "the shaded area covers the uncertainties in the different parameters , that have been explained in the text .    in fig.5",
    "we show the evolution of the chiral condensate when @xmath63 , for standard chpt .",
    "the shaded area covers the uncertainties in @xmath3 in @xmath76 as well as those due to the chiral parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have also included in the uncertainties the effect of choosing @xmath81 as that of the charged or the neutral pions , although that effect is rather small .",
    "let us remember once more that the @xmath63 results are formally equivalent to those obtained in the canonical ensemble ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the critical temperature can be estimated as the point where the condensate vanishes , and it is around 220 mev .",
    "these numbers should be interpreted extremely carefully , since the temperatures are quite high .",
    "nevertheless the plots seem to indicate a clear tendency towards chiral symmetry restoration above 200 mev .",
    "our curves continue down to negative values , but at that point the system should be in the unbroken phase and our formalism is no longer appropriate .",
    "the results are in a remarkably good agreement with those of @xcite , which were obtained from a full three loop chpt calculation .",
    "this fact is a nice check of our calculations and provides further support for their conclusions .    in order to see the effects of density on the chiral phase transition",
    ", we show in fig.6a the value of the chiral condensate in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "the region where the virial expansion is not applicable , @xmath82 mev , which is located at the far end of the picture , is almost imperceptible due to the scale .",
    "the points where @xmath83 are an estimate of the critical temperature given a fixed chemical potential .",
    "the results suggest that there are values of the chemical potential for which there is no chiral phase transition .",
    "a ) the value of @xmath84 as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath13 .",
    "b ) the value of @xmath84 as a function of the temperature and the density .    from now on we will also give results just for the central values of the different parameters and @xmath85 .    following the above reasoning it is therefore possible to obtain a qualitative phase diagram , which we have plotted in fig.7a . again",
    ", there seem to be limits , both at high and low chemical potential , where there is no phase transition ( namely , @xmath86 ) .",
    "moreover , for a given temperature , it seems possible , by decreasing @xmath13 , to change from the broken to the unbroken phase , and back to the broken phase again .",
    "a ) phase diagram of the chiral transition in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "b ) phase diagram of the chiral transition in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "the continuous line separates the phases with broken and unbroken chiral symmetry .",
    "the phase with bose - einstein condensation is located above the dotted line .",
    "apparently there are several competing effects acting on the condensate . on the one hand , the temperature tends to destroy any correlation . on the other hand",
    ", the density tends to restore the broken phase if it is very high , since then the interactions of the pions can overcome the effect of the temperature ( at these energies , each microscopic scattering follows the constraints of chiral symmetry breaking ) .",
    "but that also happens at lower densities , since the collisions are so scarce that the temperature is not able to break any existing correlation .",
    "this last effect can be easily understood since the low density limit should lead to the usual pion scattering at @xmath37 .",
    "but that would be nothing but chpt , which incorporates in its own definitions the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the plots in terms of the chemical potential have the advantage that the non - applicability region is easily defined and localized . in addition , it only occupies a tiny region of the interesting parameter space .",
    "however , the interpretation is less intuitive .",
    "therefore , we show in fig.6b the values of the chiral condensate as a function of the temperature and the density .",
    "note that now we are using the virial expansion both for the condensate itself ( since it is obtained from the pressure ) _ and the density_. therefore , there are parts of the parameter space where we can not apply the virial approach and have been intentionally left blank . from those results , we can extract once more the phase diagram , this time in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "we have plotted it in fig.7b .",
    "notice that the area within the dotted line is out of reach for our virial approach , although it seems plausible that it belongs to the broken phase .",
    "nevertheless , within the temperature and density region that we can explore , we see how the critical temperature grows extremely rapidly when we decrease the density , tending to infinity at @xmath87 .",
    "in contrast , it is not clear whether that is also the case at high densities . from the phase diagram",
    "we can see that the critical temperature grows very softly with the density above @xmath88 , but we soon cross to the region where the virial approach is not applicable .",
    "in this work we have studied the thermodynamic properties of a hadronic gas at low temperature and density in the absence of baryons . in such a case the hadronic matter can be understood as basically a gas of pions .    in order to describe the low - energy pion dynamics we have taken into account two main facts : first , that the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking makes possible the use of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) to describe @xmath89 elastic scattering , which fits rather well the low - energy data up to around @xmath90 mev . using scattering amplitudes unitarized with the inverse amplitude method , which fit the data almost up to 1 gev",
    ", we have indeed checked that , as far as @xmath89 scattering is concerned , the standard chpt approach is rather accurate in the region of interest , below the chiral phase transition .",
    "second it is a matter of fact that elastic unitarity is fulfilled up to around 1 gev .",
    "this allows us to consider the total pion number as an approximate conserved quantity at low temperatures .",
    "hence , we can define the corresponding chemical potential and the grand canonical ensemble .    with the above considerations",
    ", we have chosen a formalism where it is possible to derive the thermodynamic functions directly from the @xmath5 matrix ( phase shifts ) by means of the virial expansion . in order to find the region where the virial expansion yields an accurate result , we have first used the free gas case , for which there are closed expressions .",
    "that has also allowed us to study the bose - einstein condensation , which , apart from the interest in itself , basically determines the region where the virial approach is not applicable .",
    "indeed , for a given density , if we want to use the virial expansion , we have to be several mev above the bose - einstein phase transition .",
    "next , we have included the interactions and obtained the state equation @xmath64 , both for the standard chpt and unitarized scattering amplitudes .",
    "the agreement seems to be good enough to keep simply the standard description .",
    "finally , using the interacting gas free energy we have also studied the chiral condensate dependence on the temperature and the density .",
    "our results for zero chemical potential are in very good agreement with previous calculations using a different approach . however , by considering density effects we have now been able to obtain phase diagrams and to study the interplay of temperature , which favors the melting of the chiral condensate , with the density , which tends to enhance the chiral symmetry breaking built in the @xmath89 low energy interactions . from our phase diagrams",
    "we can learn how by diluting the hadronic gas it is possible to raise the critical temperature . at high densities",
    ", there also seems to be a very soft increase of the critical temperature , but that interpretation is more subtle due to the breaking of the virial expansion .",
    "of course , more detailed calculations should also consider heavier particles , like kaons or etas within the @xmath91 chiral scheme , as well as baryons .",
    "these contributions grow with the temperature although , in general , they are expected to lower the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "we would finally like to stress the phenomenological nature of our work since the only ingredients are chiral symmetry , unitarity , the virial expansion and the pion phase shifts .",
