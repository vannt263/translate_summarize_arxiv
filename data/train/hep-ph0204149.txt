    "the light quark sector of qcd acquires a @xmath1 symmetry and scale invariance in the limit of @xmath2 massless quarks .",
    "this limit is a reasonable starting point for constructing effective theories .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quark masses are small enough compared to the naive confinement scale ( @xmath5 ) to make the procedure reliable . incorporating the @xmath6 quark @xcite makes sense once one realizes that the relevant scale is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the conventional approach to low energy qcd is to assume that the octet of lowest lying pseudoscalar mesons @xmath8 are approximate goldstone bosons ( gb ) associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "this belief is supported by the smallness of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 meson masses as compared to the typical hadronic scale of @xmath13 .",
    "the approach leads to a so far successful description of pseudoscalar meson physics where the relevant qcd green functions are systematically expanded in powers of @xmath14 ,   @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stands for the chiral symmetry breaking scale , in the so - called chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath17 ) expansion @xcite .",
    "the remaining pseudoscalar , the @xmath18 meson , has a large mass which has been related to the breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of massless qcd are reduced to smaller symmetries in many ways .",
    "both scale invariance and @xmath0 symmetry are broken at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "the residual @xmath19 symmetry is spontaneously reduced down to @xmath20 ( the vector @xmath21 symmetry being trivial for mesons ) .",
    "finally , if one introduces mass terms , @xmath20 reduces down to isospin , or completely breaks down , depending on the choice for the quark masses .    the most important contribution to",
    "the breakdown of the @xmath22 symmetry comes from euclidean classical field configurations with non - trivial topology ( instantons ) .",
    "these effects are modulated by the @xmath23 factor , where @xmath24 denotes the strong coupling constant , thus being small at high energies but becoming important at low energies @xcite .",
    "physics beyond the low energy region ( where @xmath17 is strictly valid ) and up to the @xmath25 mass requires to introduce all the relevant degrees of freedom , namely , the @xmath26 meson , the well established @xmath27 and @xmath28 scalar mesons and the lowest lying vector meson nonet . the formulation of effective theories including the @xmath29 and its relation to the @xmath22 anomaly was firstly done in @xcite . in some of these pioneering works",
    "@xcite the starting point is a lagrangian which exhibits chiral symmetry realized in a linear way .",
    "this amounts to consider scalar fields as the chiral partners of pseudoscalars .",
    "in particular in @xcite the relation to the instanton induced quark interaction discovered by t hooft is established by expanding one of the terms in the lagrangian .",
    "scalar fields are then integrated out and authors focus on the properties of the vacuum and on the pseudoscalar phenomenology .    over the past few years",
    "the problem of the scalar mesons has been under intense debate .",
    "the identification of @xmath30 scalar mesons is still awaiting for a final answer .",
    "this problem is related to the unique qcd prediction for the existence of bound states of gluons ( glueballs ) and the possibility for the existence of hybrid states .",
    "the well established low mass scalar mesons are : the @xmath28 , @xmath31 and the recently resurrected @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) in the @xmath34 sector ; the @xmath27 and @xmath35 on the isovector side , and the isospinor @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in addition to these states there are claims for the existence of signals of other scalar mesons below 1 gev @xcite . in particular , the approach summarized in @xcite which is based on a non - linear chiral lagrangian including scalar degrees of freedom concludes the existence of a light isoscalar scalar @xmath33 and an isovector scalar @xmath37 with a mass around 850 mev .",
    "this is consistent with results in @xcite though these approaches differ in the mixing of scalars and its interpretation .",
    "the differences come from the fact that @xmath0 anomaly effects are not taken into account in @xcite , while they are considered as fundamental in @xcite .",
    "as we shall see below the picture arising in the later case is completely consistent and most of the controversial properties of scalar mesons find a natural and simple explanation in this framework .",
    "many other schemes have been put forth trying to understand the lowest lying scalar meson properties .",
    "a @xmath38 structure for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 was put on doubt since the corresponding quark models were not able to explain the tiny coupling of these mesons to two photons @xcite and the quark content suggested by the mass spectrum was incompatible with the main decay channels @xcite .",
    "more complicated models such as four quark states @xcite and molecules @xcite were advocated to explain these points .",
    "this is a very active field and no definitive conclusion has been reached as to which states are to be considered as @xmath38 , multi - quark , molecule , gluonia or hybrid states @xcite .    in this work",
    "we intend to shed some light on this problem . to this end",
    "let us first exhibit some of the properties of scalar ( and pseudoscalar ) mesons which seem to be in conflict with a @xmath30 interpretation .    on the base of a naive constituent quark model we expect the @xmath39 @xmath30 states ( @xmath40 ) to have a mass @xmath41mev where @xmath42 stands for @xmath3 or @xmath4 constituent quark mass , which we consider as equal and evaluate to one third of the proton mass . in a similar way",

    ", a @xmath48 @xmath30 state would be slightly heavier than the @xmath39 state and a @xmath49 @xmath30 state should have an even larger mass .",
    "the lowest lying vector mesons fulfill these naive expectations , it is in this sense a `` well - behaved '' sector .",
    "the pseudoscalar and scalar sectors , however , are not .",
    "the pions and kaons are lighter than expected from naive quark model considerations .",
    "the smallness of the pion and kaon masses is qualitatively understood on the base of spontaneous breaking of @xmath50-ral symmetry . however , even with this explanation in mind , there exist at least one problem in this sector which is usually overlooked and which has to do with the quark content of pseudoscalars .",
    "consider the isoscalar - pseudoscalar states with well defined quark content ( flavor states ) : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since they are not the physical states , they must be mixed somehow to yield the physical @xmath12 and @xmath53 mesons .",
    "independently of the mechanism which mixes the flavor isoscalar - pseudoscalar states , a straightforward analysis yields the relations m^2__ns= m^2 _ ^2_p + m^2_^ ^2_p ,   m^2__s= m^2 _ ^2_p + m^2_^ ^2_p , [ etans ] where the information on the mixing mechanism is hidden in the mixing angle in the flavor basis @xmath54 .",
    "this angle has been estimated as @xmath55 @xcite , corresponding to an angle @xmath56 in the naive single - angle description of pseudoscalar mesons mixing in the usual singlet - octet basis . introducing this information in eq.([etans ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the obvious question here is : why is the @xmath59 ( a @xmath30 state differing from the pion only in isospin quantum numbers ) much heavier than the pion , even more massive than the @xmath60 ( @xmath11 ) and as heavy as the ( purely strange ) @xmath61 state ?    concerning the scalar sector things are much more involved since even an undoubtful identification of the corresponding nonet is still missing .",
    "assume that the @xmath27 and @xmath28 mesons are the @xmath62 and @xmath34 members of the @xmath30 scalar nonet .",
    "their nearby degeneracy suggest that they are the scalar mesons analogous to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 vector mesons which are also almost degenerate in mass . on this identification",
    "grounds the @xmath28 should be predominantly non - strange but then : how can one explain its strong coupling to @xmath65 ? .",
    "this could be qualitatively understood if the @xmath28 had a strong strange component but then one does not understand why this meson is almost degenerate in mass with the non - strange @xmath27 . on the other hand the @xmath35 and the @xmath66",
    "seem to be heavy enough to be out of the scope of the naive quark model considerations .",
    "the same can be said for the vector @xmath36 .",
    "another possibility is the existence of light scalar mesons : @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it seems that we have now a general consensus on the existence of a broad scalar structure in the low energy region @xcite though it is not clear yet what its nature is and which mechanism makes this meson so light .",
    "the @xmath69 is a more controversial object @xcite and its existence has not been firmly established .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the vector mesons spectrum is in qualitative agreement with naive quark model expectations .",
    "thus , whatever the explanation for the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons spectrum may be , it should have no effect on the vector sector .    in this letter",
    "we suggest that all the points raised above can be understood by considering the instanton induced quark interaction which is also responsible for the @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "the appealing property of this interaction is that it does not affect the vector sector since vector mesons consist of quark - anti - quark pairs that are either both left - handed or both right - handed and do not match the quantum numbers of the instanton induced interaction @xcite .",
    "this , and the fact that it is able to explain why the @xmath53 is not a goldstone boson make this interaction a natural candidate for explaining the unusual properties of pseudoscalar mesons and their chiral partners , the scalar mesons .",
    "thus , we require a model considering both nonets in a chiral symmetric way and which takes into account thooft interaction .",
    "a model with the characteristics mentioned at the end of the previous section has been reconsidered recently @xcite .",
    "the model , incorporates pseudoscalar and scalar degrees of freedom , exhibits chiral symmetry and incorporates @xmath0 breaking in a phenomenological way .",

    "the @xmath155 degeneracy is accidental and has its origin in the instanton induced quark interaction_. in both equations above , the `` normal '' effect and the @xmath106 contributions to the splittings have the same sign .",
    "these `` normal '' splittings are largely canceled by the `` anomaly - vacuum''effect .",
    "this explains the @xmath156 degeneracy and the close value of the @xmath37 meson mass .",
    "the @xmath157 splitting has the same structure as the corresponding pseudoscalar relation in eq .",
    "( [ kapi ] ) , namely m^2_-m^2_a = (2 + (2a+b))(b - a ) but in this case the individual``anomaly - vacuum '' effects go in the opposite direction due to the `` sign''effect .",
    "both meson masses are pushed up by the anomaly with different strengths as the anomaly is coupled to different v.e.v.s .",
    "the result is a not so strong anomaly effect in the splitting which nevertheless is strong enough to largely cancel the `` normal '' splittings due to quark masses making these mesons roughly equally heavy .",
    "finally , the @xmath158 splitting can be read from eqs.([mixed2 ] ) as m^2__s - m^2__ns = -2b + 3 (b+a)(b - a ) + 2^(b^2- 2a^2 ) . in case of a vanishing anomaly",
    ", we obtain the `` normal''pattern again .",
    "switching on the anomaly affect the non - strange @xmath33 mass only ( see eq.([mixed2 ] ) ) making this meson light .",
    "in other words , the `` anomaly - vacuum '' and `` normal''contributions interfere constructively in the splitting .",
    "this makes the non - strange @xmath33 much lighter than the strange sigma .",
    "the naively expected pattern is reinforced by the `` anomaly - vacuum '' effect in contrast to the pseudoscalar analogous case in eq.([splitetasns ] ) where the anomaly overcome the `` normal '' effect .",
    "the qualitative analysis above can be graphically described as in figs . 1 - 2 , where the splittings due to the `` anomaly - vacuum '' and @xmath85 breaking effects are shown .",
    "2ex    = 450 pt     effects of @xmath0 symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar sector .",
    "2ex    = 400 pt     effects of @xmath0 symmetry breaking in the scalar sector .",
    "summarizing , we have obtained a qualitative ( and quantitative ) understanding of the lowest lying scalar ( and pseudoscalar ) meson spectrum on the basis of a simple model which incorporates the most relevant properties of qcd in the corresponding energy region , namely , the appropriate degrees of freedom , spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and @xmath22 symmetry breaking .",
    "most of the unusual properties of both sectors are explained by the coupling of the @xmath22 anomaly to the vacuum expectation values of scalars by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( `` anomaly - vacuum '' effect ) which supplies mesons with not yet considered mass terms .",
    "certainly this is only a first step in the elucidation of the quark structure of scalar mesons , and we have considered the @xmath0 anomaly as the only striking effect ( beyond chiral symmetry breaking ) . it still remain to conciliate this point of view with the 1/n perspective @xcite which is a main task . the fact that so many phenomena are explained by a single effect makes this model attractive as a starting point for more elaborate and systematic analysis .",
    "it is also reassuring that quantitative estimates of the model predictions for the scalar meson decays where intermediate vector mesons can not appear or their contribution is known to be small are successful .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the puzzling @xmath159 and @xmath160 decays are properly described within the model @xcite and the recent measurements for the @xmath161 decay @xcite are consistent with model predictions @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the model is necessary in order to reach a more complete description of meson properties .",
    "this is shown by its failure to satisfactorily describe the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "other effects such as the hadronic loops considered in @xcite could remedy this .",
    "another possibility is to include degrees of freedom which could be relevant to the physics in this energy region and so far have not been considered .",
    "in particular , glueballs degrees of freedom could have some effects via their mixing with pure quarkonium states . a step in this direction",
    "is the work in @xcite where glueball degrees of freedom are considered in a framework close to the one used here and its worthy to analyze its consequences in detail .",
    "a different line of action which is worth exploring is the relation of the instanton induced quark interaction with the recently raised group theoretical arguments in favor of the unitary symmetry as an accidental symmetry due to the gluon anomaly @xcite .",
