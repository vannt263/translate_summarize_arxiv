    "physics of neutrinos will soon be entering into the era of precision physics .",
    "proposed projects such as t2k  @xcite and no@xmath1a  @xcite experiment will be able to measure the mixing parameters responsible for atmospheric neutrino oscillation , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with a few percent uncertainty . moreover",
    ", these experiments can probe @xmath4 down to @xmath5 or smaller .",
    "if non - zero @xmath6 will be established , the future phases of these experiments will be aimed to determine the cp violating phase as well as the mass hierarchy  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has been known that in order to perform precise determinations of neutrino mixing parameters including the cp phase and mass hierarchy , one must confront with the problem of so called parameter degeneracy .",
    "there are 3 types of such degeneracy , octant  @xcite , intrinsic  @xcite and sign @xmath7  @xcite degeneracy . here",
    "we focus only on the octant degeneracy , which is decoupled from the other ones with a good approximation in our experimental set up .",
    "we consider only experiments based on the conventional neutrino beam from accelerator and reactor neutrinos .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is different from @xmath8 .",
    "disappearance @xmath9 experiment can determine quite precisely the value of @xmath10 with 1% uncertainty  @xcite but this does not allow us to know in which octant @xmath0 lives , and leads , at first approximation , ignoring @xmath6 , to the following 2 degenerate solutions , @xmath11/2 $ ] .",
    "for example , @xmath12 or 0.6 ( 0.45 or 0.55 ) if @xmath13 ( 0.99 ) .",
    "how and to what extent this can be resolved is the topics of this talk .",
    "let us first discuss the possibility to resolve this degeneracy by combining accelerator and reactor neutrinos  @xcite , based on the suggestion in  @xcite . as a concrete example , we consider the second phase of the t2k experiment  @xcite with upgraded beam power of 4 mw and hyper - kamiokande ( hk ) detector , and high statistics second generation reactor experiment , e.g. angra project  @xcite .",
    "we fix the mixing parameters relevant for solar neutrinos as @xmath14 ev@xmath15 and @xmath16 = 0.31 , and the atmospheric @xmath17 ev@xmath15 .",
    "the exposures for accelerator are assumed to be 2 ( 6 ) years of neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) running with hk whose fiducial volume is 0.54 mt , whereas for the reactor we assume an exposure of 10 gw@xmath18kt@xmath18yr , which is defined as a product of reactor power , detector volume and running time .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the process of how the octant degeneracy can be resolved by combining the results from accelerator and reactor . figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) show that by combining the @xmath9 and @xmath19 modes from accelerator , we can get 2 separated allowed regions where one of them corresponds to the fake solution .",
    "then if we add the result of the measurement of @xmath6 form reactor experiment , which is shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we can eliminate the fake solution and end up with the true one as shown in fig .",
    "-0.9 cm -0.5 cm   -0.5 cm figure 1 .",
    "( a ) region allowed by the disappearance ( 2 approximately horizontal bands ) and by the appearance ( the other curved band ) accelerator measurement .",
    "( b ) the regions that remain allowed when results shown in ( a ) are combined .",
    "( c ) the regions allowed by reactor measurement .",
    "( d ) the regions allowed after combining all the results from accelerator and the reactor experiments . taken from  @xcite .",
    "0.30 cm    we show in fig .",
    "2 the parameter region of @xmath20 and @xmath21 where the octant degeneracy can be resolved .",
    "the degeneracy can be resolved for @xmath22 0.96 at 2 @xmath23 cl for @xmath24 0.05 ( see upper panel ) .",
    "we confirmed the strong dependence of sensitivity on @xmath6 expected in @xcite .",
    "next we discuss another possibility based on  @xcite . in the second phase of t2k experiment ( hk with 4 mw beam ) , in order to improve the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy determination",
    ", it was suggested to place the second identical detector at korea with baseline of 1050 km , in addition to the one at kamioka .",
    "here we assume 2 detectors are not only identical but also receive the neutrino beam with the same energy spectrum by choosing the same off axis angle ( 2.5 degree in this case ) .",
    "it was shown that this experimental set up can also resolve the octant degeneracy  @xcite .    -1.3 cm   -3.6 cm   -2.1 cm figure 2 .",
    "region of parameters where @xmath0 degeneracy can be resolved .",
    "upper ( lower ) panel corresponds to conservative ( optimistic ) choice of the systematic uncertainties . taken from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : reactor - sensitivity2 ] 0.3 cm the idea is to detect the `` solar '' term defined as @xmath25 , which is possible if the detector is placed far enough . since this term is proportional to @xmath26 , in principle , one can tell in which octant @xmath0 lies . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the expected number of muon and electron events as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy at kamioka and korea for @xmath12 and 0.6 . we observe that at korea for the electron events , appreciable difference exist between the data corresponding to these 2 degenerate solutions , which can tell us the correct octant .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the region of parameters where the octant degeneracy can be resolved by the 2 detector method .",
    "let us note that resolving power ( sensitivity ) does not depend much on the value of @xmath6 which is very different from the + -1 cm    -0.4 cm -0.4 cm   figure 3 .",

    "0.27  mton detectors both in kamioka and korea and 4 years running with neutrino beam and another 4 years with anti - neutrino beam are assumed . in left",
    "( right ) 2 panels , the sensitivity is defined so that the experiment can resolve the octant degeneracy for any ( half ) values of the cp phase @xmath28 .",
    "taken from @xcite .",
    "0.2 cm previous case shown in fig . 2 where the sensitivity is significantly worse ( better ) when @xmath6 is small ( large ) .",
    "we conclude that in this method , the octant degeneracy can be resolved for @xmath22 0.97 at 2 @xmath23 cl even for very small values of @xmath6 .",
    "the expected sensitivities by the 2 methods we discussed show very different dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is larger , close to the present limit , the method of combining accelerator and reactor would give better sensitivity whereas for smaller @xmath6 , the accelerator based 2 detector methods would be better , and therefore , these 2 methods are complementary to each other .",
