    "since the first studies @xcite of entanglement in the ground - state of interacting spin @xmath2 systems , a considerable amount of work has been devoted to analyze this feature .",
    "the hamiltonians most studied have been those with nearest neighbor interactions ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 etc . ) between the spins in the presence of an external magnetic field ( usually constant ) which is the order parameter for a quantum phase transition ( i.e. , non - analyticity in the ground- state energy ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fascinating and intricate connections and relations between ( mainly two - site subsystem ) entanglement and the quantum phase transition have been systematically studied after @xcite . at the other extreme , namely models where each spin interacts identically with all the others ,",
    "there are studies of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model ( @xcite ) which is of the @xmath11 type in an external field , and of an equivalent of the bcs model ( @xcite ) which is of the @xmath10 type in an external field .",
    "a recent review of the subject is @xcite . + here ,",
    "we are not concerned with the quantum phase transition aspects but with the dependence on the range of the spin pair - interactions .",
    "one of the basic facts emerging from the studies mentioned above , is that if the anisotropies are large in nearest - neighbour interacting systems , then the system behaves qualitatively as the ( quantum ) ising model ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "also , entanglement vanishes for large external fields .",
    "moreover , two - site subsystem entanglement in the ground - state is short - ranged : it vanishes if the sites are not nearest , or next - nearest neighbors .",
    "+ the maximization of nearest - neighbor entanglement in translationally invariant pure states of quantum spin @xmath2 chains has been the subject of various studies .",
    "@xcite finds an upper bound of about @xmath15 for the nearest neighbor concurrence , and shows that in antiferromagnetics rings in which neighboring particles interact via the heisenberg hamiltonian there are states with larger nearest - neighbor entanglement than the ground state . on the other hand , since the work of coffman , kundu and wootters , @xcite , it is known that there are limitations to the amount of entanglement that can be shared by three q - bits , so some efforts have been made in order to find if in a uniform chain where each qubit is equally entangled with its two neighbors , the coffman - kundu - wootters bound is achievable .",
    "the subject was also addressed in @xcite .",
    "+ nearest - neighbor entanglement was also analyzed in @xcite , for the finitely correlated states ( generalized valence bond states ) of fannes , nachtergaele and werner @xcite , which arise as ground states of hamiltonians with short - ranged interactions .",
    "the upper bound for nearest - neighbor concurrence obtained in @xcite is practically equal to that of @xcite .    in this communication we present some results on entanglement of 2-spin subsystems for eigenstates of a hamiltonian where the spins are subject to a long - range interaction inversely proportional to a power of their distance and the external magnetic field vanishes .",
    "our study is not restricted to the ground - state(s ) , but includes the whole spectrum .",
    "in particular , we are interested in which eigenstates show two - site entanglement for long distances , i.e. beyond nearest or next - nearest neighbors . besides , we are interested in the dependence of the distance for which it is possible to obtain two - site entanglement on the range of the interaction between the spins .",
    "specifically we consider @xmath1 spins @xmath2 and the heisenberg hamiltonian is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the vector operator formed with the three pauli operators associated to the @xmath4-th spin , and @xmath18 is proportional to the distance between vertexes @xmath4 and @xmath6 in a regular , flat , @xmath1-gon whose vertices are numbered consecutively . the constant in the definition is chosen so that the nearest neighbor distance @xmath19 is one . for given @xmath1 ,",
    "the number of distinct distances is @xmath20 $ ] the largest integer not above @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that @xmath22 is the isotropic heisenberg model where each spin interacts identically with every other spin .",
    "for @xmath23 fixed , the limit @xmath24 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic xxx model .",
    "we often drop the index @xmath1 and parameter @xmath9 in @xmath25 , when these are irrelevant .",
    "+ the hamiltonian @xmath26 is `` anti - ferromagnetic '' , while @xmath27 is `` ferromagnetic '' .",
    "if @xmath1 is even then the least energy eigenvalue is non - degenerate , whereas it is degenerate for uneven @xmath1 . + for @xmath7 this is the haldane - shastry model @xcite which is explicitely solvable @xcite . here",
    "the least eigen - energy is fourfold degenerate for uneven @xmath1 , and the largest energy eigenvalue ( ground - state energy of the ferromagnetic version ) is always degenerate with multiplicity @xmath28 . + the spectrum for @xmath7 is highly degenerate with comparatively few eigenvalues and very different from the spectrum for @xmath8 and same @xmath1 . for example for @xmath29 , where the hilbert space has dimension @xmath30 , @xmath26 has 5 eigenvalues for @xmath31 , 19 for @xmath7 and 45 for @xmath32 , except for a discrete and finite set of values of @xmath9 , where a crossing or two reduces the number of distinct eigenvalues by 1 or 2 ( see figures [ evsalfa ] , [ sizeofspectrum ] ) ; the nearest - neighbor xxx model corresponding to @xmath33 has @xmath34 eigenvalues .",
    "these qualitative features do not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "due to the absence of effective criteria for multipartite entanglement in mixed states , we study only the entanglement of the possible pairs of spins , that is two - site entanglement .",
    "it suffices to consider the pairs @xmath35 for @xmath36 + 1 $ ] ; corresponding to the possible distances .",
    "given a state @xmath37 of system of @xmath1 spins , @xmath38 denotes the reduction of @xmath37 to the subsystem with components ( i.e. , sites ) @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the entanglement of this reduced state is detected and quantified by its concurrence , @xcite .",
    "+ our analysis proceeds as follows .",
    "one has @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the transposition interchanging the @xmath4-th and @xmath6-th components of the product basis vectors @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "that is , @xmath43    to simplify the structure of the corresponding matrix in the above basis , we consider the operator ( hamiltonian ) @xmath44 which differs from @xmath45 by an additive , @xmath46-dependent constant .",
    "thus @xmath45 and @xmath47 have the same number of distinct eigenvalues with the same multiplicities and the same spectral orthoprojectors .",
    "figure [ evsalfa ] shows the spectrum of @xmath48 for @xmath29 as a function of @xmath9 up to @xmath49 .",
    "we find that beyond @xmath9 about @xmath50 there are no crossings , c.f .",
    "figure [ sizeofspectrum ] , but eigenvalue curves do approach each other asymptotically leading to @xmath34 eigen - energies in the nearest - neighbor model ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the largest eigen - energy of @xmath51 is zero , it is @xmath52-fold degenerate for every @xmath53 , and the corresponding spectral orthoprojector is independent of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in fact an orthonormal basis of this eigen - space is easily described ; is consists of @xmath28 vectors each of which is the normalized sum of the @xmath54 vectors of the form ( [ base ] ) where exactly @xmath55 of the @xmath56 s are @xmath57 ; and @xmath58 .",
    "denote the spectrum with @xmath59 ; suppose @xmath60 is the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath61 is the multiplicity ( degeneracy ) of the eigen - energy @xmath62 .",
    "+ at this point , we must recall theorem 2 of @xcite which says that any subspace of dimension at least @xmath63 of the four - dimensional hilbert space of two q - bits contains at least one product vector .",
    "thus if the eigen - energy @xmath62 of a two spin @xmath2 system is degenerate , then there is a separable eigenvector to @xmath62 . extensions of this result to sufficiently high dimensional subspaces of @xmath1 ( @xmath64 ) q - bits are possible but this is not the point of this paper . to analyze entanglement in the case of degenerate eigenvalues , we must consider the ( uniform ) eigen - state @xmath65 notice that this state is obtained by mixing with equal weights ( namely @xmath66 ) any ( pairwise orthogonal ) pure eigen - states whose corresponding vectors constitute an orthonormal basis of the eigenspace of the eigenvalue @xmath62 of @xmath26 .",
    "+ for the haldane - shastry model ( @xmath7 ) , we use the known eigenvalues and degeneracies @xcite , and determine the orthoprojectors by : @xmath67 . for @xmath8",
    "we determine the eigen - energies and corresponding spectral projections numerically .",
    "due to the particular symmetry of @xmath26 or @xmath48 which commutes with @xmath68 and with @xmath69 ( @xcite ) the reduced density operators ( in the basis ( [ base ] ) of product eigenvectors of @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) for any pair @xmath72 of spins have the same structure namely @xmath73 where @xmath74 , with @xmath75 ; and @xmath76 is real with @xmath77 .",
    "the concurrence of this 2-spin state is @xmath78 .",
    "+ the above structure of @xmath38 implies that the reduced density matrix for the @xmath4-th site is simply and always just @xmath79 which is the maximally mixed state for a spin @xmath2 .",
    "this remarkable feature of the model is independent of @xmath1 , @xmath80 and the eigen - energy considered . as a consequence , the meyer - wallach measure @xcite ( which , when the state is pure , is a true measure of entanglement and not just a measure of degree of mixture ) given by @xmath81 is identically equal to @xmath82 for every eigen - state @xmath83 independently of @xmath1 , @xmath80 and the eigen - energy considered . +",
    "another remarkable feature is that @xmath84 , the reduced density matrix for sites @xmath72 for the eigen - state of maximal energy which was described above and seen to be independent of @xmath9 , is also independent of the pair @xmath72 , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the this maximal energy eigen - state ( ground - state of the ferromagnetic model ) does not show entanglement at all site distances . +",
    "our calculations were performed for @xmath85 . up to the degeneracies in the lowest eigen - energy , the qualitative features are independent of @xmath1 in that range .",
    "the graphs shown corrrespond to @xmath29 . + here is a list of some of our observations for the mentioned values of @xmath1 ( others will follow ) :    * the isotropic model @xmath22 shows no two - site entanglement for all distances at every eigen - energy .",
    "* in the ground - state there is exclusively nearest neighbor two - site entanglement for every @xmath80 ( @xmath80 was sampled rather completely only for @xmath29 ) ; the corresponding concurrence is a slowly varying increasing function of @xmath80 which is discontinuous at @xmath86 ( see figure [ fig12 - 13 ] ) . * for every @xmath80 nearest neighbor entanglement appears only in the first few energy levels ( i.e. , for @xmath29 , the first four or five energy levels ) .",
    "if an excited state presents nearest neighbor entanglement for some @xmath80 then the corresponding concurrence is below that of the ground - state nearest neighbor concurrence for that value of @xmath9 .",
    "however , nearest neighbor concurrence is not generally a decreasing function of the energy for fixed @xmath80 ( see figure [ a=1 ] ) . * the distinctive feature of the case @xmath7 with respect to the cases @xmath87 is simple : _ for @xmath7 there is no two - site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors at all eigen - energies . for @xmath88 two - site entanglement for other possible distances",
    "appear at some excited eigen - energy level .",
    "_ in fact , two - site entanglement for all possible distances is present for every @xmath9 at some excited energy - level except for @xmath9 in a certain bounded interval which depends on @xmath1 . * except for exceptional values of",
    "@xmath9 one finds excited states where the concurrence for sites further apart than nearest neighbors have greater concurrence than the ground - state nearest neighbor concurrence .",
    "for example , for @xmath29 and almost all @xmath80 ( @xmath89 is exceptional ) one finds some excited state where the concurrence for sites at maximal distance is always above the nearest neighbor concurrence for the ground state .",
    "* in the ferromagnetic model @xmath27 , the ground - state does not show pair - entanglement at all distances and the same is true for the low energy eigenstates , but the number of the states with this property decreases with @xmath9 .",
    "the first excited states which exhibit two - site entanglement do so for the largest distances .",
    "only high energy eigen - states show nearest - neighbor entanglement .",
    "all this is seen in figures [ a=1]-[a = nn ] .",
    "the series of four figures [ a=1]-[a = nn ] show the concurrence of @xmath90 for the possible eigen - energies @xmath62 for @xmath29 and distinct values of @xmath9 . in all these figures",
    "the dot corresponds to nearest neighbor distance ( @xmath91 ) , the cross @xmath92 to the next - nearest neighbor distance ( @xmath93 ) , the star @xmath94 to @xmath95 and the empty square @xmath96 to the maximal distance @xmath97 .",
    "+ we mention a curious feature of the nearest neighbor model which is apparent in figure [ a = nn ] .",
    "nearest neighbor concurrence where it is positive , is a linear decreasing function of the energy : concurrence ( @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "this linear regime is reached very rapidly as @xmath9 grows to infinity ; e.g. for @xmath29 and @xmath100 one is practically in the linear regime . + for @xmath29 we have also analyzed if energy is distance selective for two - site entanglement .",
    "we find that if at some eigen - energy there is two - site entanglement at nearest or next - nearest neighbor distance then there is no entanglement at all the other possible distances .",
    "however , two - site entanglement at maximal and next to maximal distances can be present for the same energy level in certain intervals of @xmath9 values .",
    "another way of presenting our results consists in graphing the concurrence of @xmath101 for fixed @xmath1 and distance @xmath102 as a function of @xmath9 while keeping the number of the ( excited ) level @xmath62 fixed .",
    "this is done in figures [ 15 - 2 ] , [ 14 - 8 ] , [ 15&14 - 42 ] , and [ detail ] .",
    "figure [ 15 - 2 ] always for @xmath29 gives the concurrence of the second excited eigenstate @xmath83 ( associated to the second eigen - energy above the ground - state energy ) reduced to two sites at the maximal possible distance for @xmath29 which corresponds to @xmath97 ; after @xmath103 , there is persistent entanglement for maximally distant sites in this energy eigen - state .",
    "+ figure [ 14 - 8 ] illustrates the same features for the eighth excited state and distance @xmath93 ( next nearest neighbors ) ; entanglement is only present in a bounded interval @xmath104 with @xmath105 below @xmath82 .",
    "figure [ 15&14 - 42 ] presents two - site concurrence at maximal distance and distance @xmath95 for the fourty first excited energy eigen - state ( which is not present for @xmath7 ) ; again entanglement persists and coexists for both distances for this level beyond @xmath106 .",
    "below this value both concurrences show discontinuities as illustrated in figure [ detail ] for the concurrence of sites at maximal distance in the fourty first excited state .",
    "+ figure [ cantidad ] shows the number of energy eigen - states with two - site entanglement at the four possible distances present in the case @xmath29 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "+ we also calculated for completeness the measure of de oliveira et al @xcite : @xmath107 for fixed @xmath1 and fixed number of the excited eigen - energy in @xmath83 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "we observe that this measure ( which is a true multipartite entanglement measure only for pure states ) is a slowly varying function of @xmath9 except for jump discontinuities at all points where the corresponding level experiences a crossing .",
    "+ the viewpoint adopted in the previous figures holding the number of the excited energy level fixed which is often natural in physical problems , is not the most appropiate to obtain a simple description of our observations due to the large amount of crossings ( apparent in figure [ evsalfa ] ) .",
    "it is more appropiate to adopt a perturbation theoretic point of view . for fixed @xmath1 , the operator families @xmath45 and @xmath108 are holomorphic in @xmath109 in the sense of kato @xcite",
    "thus , for example for @xmath29 , and away from the exceptional points where crossings occur ( see figure [ evsalfa ] ) , there are fourty five pairwise orthogonal projectors which depend real analytically on @xmath9 .",
    "the two - site concurrence for any pair of sites obtained by normalizing these orthoprojectors to states will be real analytic functions of @xmath9 away from the crossings .",
    "this alternative way of analyzing two - site entanglement , shows that only very few of the orthoprojectors carry two - site entanglement as is illustrated in the following figure pairs .",
    "figure [ fig12 - 13 ] shows all the non - zero concurrences for nearest neighbors ( namely five ) for @xmath29 as functions of @xmath9 in the top graph , while the lower graph shows which five of the energy curves of figure [ evsalfa ] give rise to these nearest neighbor concurrences . in the concurrence graph of figure [ fig12 - 13 ] , only the curve corresponding to maximal nearest - neighbor concurrence ( @xmath110 ) is associated to only one level , in this case the ground - state .",
    "all other concurrence curves in this graph mix ( due to crossings ) energy levels of different excitation number .",
    "the discontinuities occur at crossings and not all of them are visible in the figure . the following pair of graphs [ fig14 - 15 ] deals with next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the energy curves ( lower graph ) are only drawn where two - site entanglement ( at the corresponding distance ) is present and they are not drawn through the whole range of values of @xmath9 ( this is repeated for the other distances to be shown below ) .",
    "observe that the entanglement at next - nearest neighbor distance @xmath93 has a gap : for @xmath9 betweeen about @xmath111 and @xmath112 there is no next - nearest neighbor entanglement at all eigen - energies ; this is the only distance which shows this feature .",
    "the graph pairs of figures [ fig16 - 17 ] and [ fig18 - 19 ] , repeat this for the distances @xmath95 , and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "close inspection of figures [ fig16 - 17 ] and [ fig18 - 19 ] show that the maximal concurrence ( labeled _ a _ in figure [ fig18 - 19 ] ) at maximal distance @xmath97 and the monotone increasing concurrence curve ( labeled _ a _ in figure [ fig16 - 17 ] ) for the distance @xmath95 originate in the same energy curve ( i.e. its corresponding orthoprojector ) namely _ a _ in the lower graphs of figures [ fig16 - 17 ] and [ fig18 - 19 ] .",
    "this feature appears also for nearest neighbor and maximal distance entanglement : the energy vs. @xmath9 curves labeled _ c _ in figures [ fig12 - 13 ] and [ fig18 - 19 ] coincide ; however entanglement at maximal distance appears only above @xmath114 a careful count shows that of the @xmath115 orthoprojectors only @xmath116 carry two site entanglement , of these @xmath117 do so for one distance only , only one carries two - site entanglement at two distances simultaneously for all values of @xmath80 , and only one carries two - site entanglement at two distance simultaneously albeit above some threshold value of @xmath9 ( as just described ) . + the following table gives the dimension of the fourty five orthoprojectors appearing for @xmath29 and the number of times each dimension appears .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "all six one - dimensional orthoprojectors carry two - site entanglement and two of these do so for two distinct distances ( @xmath118 for all @xmath80 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 ) .",
    "we present a study of pair ( or two - site ) entanglement for the eigenstates of an @xmath1 spin @xmath2 model where the spins ( sites ) are equidistant in a circular ring and the pair - interaction is inversely proportional to an arbitrary positive power @xmath9 of the site distance , and proportional to the scalar product of the magnetic moments of the spins .",
    "the model interpolates between a nearest neighbor interaction model ( of type xxx ) and a model where every spin interacts equally with all the others .",
    "the model is solvable for @xmath121 ( haldane - shastry model , loc .",
    "cit . ) where the spectrum is extremely degenerate , for every @xmath1 , relatively to @xmath8 and same @xmath1 .",
    "we do not include an external magnetic field in the hamiltonian , and thus exclude a quantum phase transition , i.e. non - analytic behavior of the ground - state energy as a function of the magnetic field strength .",
    "+ we do not concentrate on ground - state entanglement ( the ground - state energy is degenerate for uneven @xmath1 ) but analyze all eigen - energies .",
    "the qualitative features reported are independent of @xmath1 up to @xmath29 , and we have no doubts that they are independent of @xmath1 for all @xmath1 .",
    "one of our original motivations for studying the model was to find long - range pair entanglement in the ground - state ! our expectations in this direction",
    "were completely wrong ; a key feature is the observed insensitivity to the range of the interaction of two - site entanglement for the ground - state .",
    "not only there is no two - site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors independently of the range of the interaction controlled by @xmath9 , but also , e,.g . for @xmath29 , taking the limit @xmath122 and comparing this with the nearest - neighbor concurrence in the nearest neighbor interaction model ( @xmath33 ) , the variation is only about 2.5% percent over the whole range of values of @xmath80 .",
    "moreover the value is about @xmath123 of the upper bound claimed by @xcite .",
    "+ our second observation is that a simple glance at a figure of the type of figures [ a=1]-[a = nn ] allows the onlooker to decide whether @xmath124 or not .",
    "two - site entanglement of eigenstates is able to detect a spectral `` collapse '' .",
    "+ thirdly , one can produce selective two - site entanglement at any required distance by appropiately choosing @xmath9 and/or the energy - level ; a feature which is of some interest .",
    "+ finally , we point out that for every @xmath125 , including the nearest neighbor model ( see figure [ a = nn ] ) , there is an excited eigen - state which is pure ( except for special values of @xmath9 where a crossing occurs ; see figure [ fig18 - 19 ] ) which presents entanglement at maximal distance and at next to maximal distance simultaneously .",
    "this state corresponds to the energy vs. @xmath9 curve labeled _ a _ in figures [ fig18 - 19 ] and [ fig16 - 17 ] .",
    "the concurrence for maximal distance in this state is the maximal concurrence for all possible distances in all eigen - states",
