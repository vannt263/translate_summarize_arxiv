    "many real - world systems and applications under scrutiny these days require random diluted graphs to model the interactions .",

    "a simple , and much used , example of this type of graphs is the finitely connected random graph with @xmath0-spin ising - like interactions .",
    "such graphs are succesfully employed in the description and analysis of error correcting codes ( e.g. the low density parity check codes , see @xcite - @xcite ) , satisfiability problems ( e.g. the k - sat problem , @xcite ) , modelling of structural glasses and spinglasses @xcite , proteomic networks @xcite , etc .",
    "+ some of these systems , however , require not only long - range interactions to effectively describe the system , but moreover possess local structures .",
    "there is a notion of neighborhood or distance between spins , and spins that are close have additional interactions of another type than the long - range ones .",
    "it is in this context that small - world networks have been developed , to provide a simple model that combines both long - range interactions with local interactions .",
    "one such small - world network to which a lot of work has already been devoted ( see @xcite and references therein ) is the random graph supplemented with a one - dimensional chain connecting all spins together , yielding the most simple notion of neighborhood : nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "+ in this work we study the thermodynamic properties of such a small - world graph , composed of a finite and constant number of @xmath0-spin interactions ( a @xmath0-spin bethe - lattice ) and a one - dimensional chain interconnecting all spins .",
    "we calculate the self - consistent equations governing the statics of the system by employing transfer - matrix techniques , and solve these equations in the replica symmetric ( rs ) approximation to determine the spinglass transition and the static and dynamic ferromagnetic transitions as function of the system parameters .",
    "we focus especially on the influence of bond - disorder .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams show reentrance effects , indicating replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) , and we apply one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) in the reentrance regions .",
    "the results obtained are compared with monte - carlo simulations .",
    "this paper extends our earlier work ( see @xcite ) , where we used analogous methods to study a small - world graph with poisson - distributed interactions .",

    "<S> we study the thermodynamic properties of spin systems with bond - disorder on small - world hypergraphs , obtained by superimposing a one - dimensional ising chain onto a random bethe graph with @xmath0-spin interactions . using transfer - matrix techniques , </S>",
    "<S> we derive fixed - point equations describing the relevant order parameters and the free energy , both in the replica symmetric and one step replica symmetry breaking approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the static and dynamic ferromagnetic transition and the spinglass transition within replica symmetry for all temperatures , and demonstrate corrections to these results when one step replica symmetry breaking is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained are in agreement with monte - carlo simulations . </S>"
