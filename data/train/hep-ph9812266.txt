    "the violation of the gottfried sum rule discovered by the nmc collaboration at cern in muon deep inelastic scattering @xcite opened the long ongoing discussion on the @xmath6 asymmetry in the nucleon . extending and following the early work of sullivan @xcite ,",
    "the asymmetry can be naturally explained within the framework of the isovector meson cloud model of the nucleon ( for recent reviews see @xcite and references therein ) , which uniquely predicted the asymmetry to be placed at large @xmath5 , in good agreement with the early na51 drell - yan experiment @xcite . in the practical evaluation",
    "the dominant contribution can be interpreted as due to the admixture of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 fock - states in the physical proton .",
    "the model results for the asymmetry depend in essential way on the choice of the parameters for @xmath3 and @xmath11 vertices , and on the elementary particle vs. regge treatment of meson exchanges . in most of the calculations the vertex parameters , which at present can not be calculated from first principles , were simply adjusted to reproduce the observed gottfried sum rule violation .",
    "in contrast in refs.@xcite a unified approach to hadronic reactions and deep inelastic scattering has been pursued and the vertex parameters were constrained by the experimental data on the leading nucleon and/or leading delta isobar production in high - energy hadronic reactions to which pion exchange contributes substantially .",
    "the numerical evaluations of the @xmath0 asymmetry were based on the fact that for an elementary particle exchange the contribution to the total virtual photo ",
    "absorption cross section equals that to the inclusive cross section for leading baryon production , which is one of the manifestations of the extended agk unitarity relations @xcite . for the pion exchange such a treatment",
    "is well justified , because the reggeization effects are negligible .    besides the pion vertex parameters , the @xmath0 asymmetry is affected by the contribution of heavier isovector mesons . in ref.@xcite",
    "the effect of heavier vector mesons has been evaluated in an extended fock state decomposition of the nucleon light - cone wave function into meson - baryon , including @xmath12 in addition to @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are known to be important at low and intermediate energy hadron scattering .",
    "a fit to leading baryon experimental data suggests then a rather large @xmath15 component in the expansion of the nucleon wave function .",
    "the relatively heavy @xmath16meson , carries then a large fraction of the nucleon momentum and with a plausible ansatz for the @xmath17 vertex , it introduces the @xmath6 which extends to rather large @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the so - constructed model was perfectly consistent with the na51 experiment at cern @xcite , which measured the @xmath0asymmetry at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , after the incorporation of the na51 result , the global parton model analyses have produced parametrizations which were practically indistinguishable from the results of the meson cloud dynamical calculations in @xcite .",
    "a recent e866 experiment at fermilab has reported a first high precision mapping of the @xmath5-dependence of the @xmath0 asymmetry from the comparison of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 drell - yan production with the striking finding that the difference of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 distributions seems to vanish at large @xmath24 , difference in @xcite depends on assumptions on the flavour symmetric sea @xmath25 . within the error bars of e866 one",
    "can regard @xmath25 as well constrained by the neutrino experiments , the difference between @xmath25 from different gobal parton analyses is marginal . ] and is definitely smaller than the results of the model @xcite and of all the early global parton parametrizations based on the na51 result and the observed gsr violation .",
    "there is no consensus yet on understanding this interesting result @xcite . in the framework of the meson cloud picture ,",
    "one possible improvement is a regge treatment of heavy particle exchanges , which seems to be more appropriate in the kinematical region relevant to the @xmath0 asymmetry problem .",
    "although , because of the lack of a microscopic qcd picture of reggeon exchange one is forced to use rather a phenomenological approach , one can take advantage of a large body of work on the regge phenomenology of hadronic two - body exclusive @xcite , and inclusive @xcite , reactions , which constrains the regge vertices , and imposes useful constraints between reggeon contributions to inclusive production of different baryons .",
    "recently there was some interest in understanding the role of isoscalar reggeons in diffractive lepton deep - inelastic scattering @xcite and in inclusive production of leading protons at hera @xcite .",
    "the role of isovector reggeons was discussed both in the context of leading neutron production in electron dis @xcite and in the context of diffractive dis scattering with leading neutrons @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the isovector reggeon exchanges in neutron and proton production must be much more important than in the evaluations of @xcite based on the total cross section analyses , because the latter constrain only the spin ",
    "non  flip regge vertices , and the much more dominant spin ",
    "flip contribution has not been considered in @xcite . as will be discussed in the present paper",
    "this has important consequences for the inclusive spectra of neutrons from @xmath26 transitions both in hadronic and lepton dis and indirectly also for @xmath6 asymmetry .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the role of isovector reggeon exchange in the production of leading nucleons and @xmath1 isobars .",
    "the subsequent decay of the @xmath1 isobar into @xmath9 channel generates additional nucleons both in hadronic as well as in lepton dis processes .",
    "based on the extended agk unitarity relation , we shall argue however that in spite of the important role in populating the @xmath27 and @xmath28 inclusive channels , the opening of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 intermediate states via reggeon exchange leads to a negligible contribution to the hadronic total cross sections and/or the structure functions in dis . as a consequence the isovector reggeon contribution to the gottfried sum rule violation is rather small . on the other hand",
    "the reggeon exchange contributions to the leading baryon spectra leave less room for the pion exchange contributions , which are essential for a quantitative understanding of the gottfried sum rule violation and the @xmath29 asymmetry .",
    "our principal conclusion is that once the wealth of information on leading pions and leading neutrons and @xmath1 s is accounted for there emerges a consistent description of the e866 ( nusea ) data .",
    "following sullivan @xcite , we expect that the dominant mechanism of leading neutron production in dis is an absorption of the virtual photon on the pion from the @xmath30-fock state of the nucleon , in which the spectator neutrons are observed as leading neutrons .",
    "but the _ same _ dynamics is supposed to be at work in the production of leading neutrons in hadronic semi - inclusive reactions , where the virtual photon has been swapped for the hadronic projectile . in the meson - baryon fock - state picture of the proton s light - cone wave function one",
    "is still left with nonperturbative parameters , the radii of the fock - states or in other words the form factor cut - off parameters .",
    "these parameters can not be obtained from first principles , but one may hope to constrain them in a reasonably reliable way by demanding a consistency with experimental data for hadron production at high energies . this strategy has been taken in the work of the jlich group @xcite and the earlier work by zoller @xcite to extract the parameters of vertex form factors .",
    "some subtle points connected to the distortion of the waves ( or absorptive or screening corrections ) have been discussed in a recent paper @xcite , we shall also comment on that issue below .",
    "let us first collect the pertinent formulae for the following discussions of the experimental data .",
    "following the standard phenomenology of inclusive reactions , we define the lorentz - invariant cross section ( the so - called inclusive structure function ) for the @xmath31 reaction ( see fig.[diagram1 ] )    ^b c ( z,2 ) = e d d^3(ab c x ) = z ddz d2 = 1 ddz dt = s dds_x dt + = 1 2 ( 2 ) ^3 1 2 s _ i , x d _ x | a^ab cx_i ( s , t , s_x,_x ) |^2 .",

    "the mandelstam variables @xmath42 refer to the reaction @xmath43 ; and the index @xmath44 labels the exchange mechanism . )",
    "we have omitted the contributions from interferences of different exchange mechanisms @xmath45 .",
    "they are absent in the reactions considered as will be discussed below . ] in anticipation of large contributions from the region @xmath46 to the considered cross section we shall use the regge form throughout the present paper . the large regge parameter in this case is @xmath47 and one can write the amplitudes @xmath48 in the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the regge trajectory , @xmath51/ \\sin \\pi \\alpha_i ( t)$ ] is the signature factor for the trajectory with signature @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the vertex for the transition @xmath54 that leads to the ( operational ) definition of the @xmath55 total cross section via @xmath56 with these definitions we finally obtain for the inclusive cross section @xmath57 at this point it is convenient to introduce the notion of a flux associated with the exchanged object in the @xmath58channel : f_i / c ( z_i ) = d^2 _ or more explicitly : f_i / c ( z_i ) = d2 ( g^i_ac(t ) ) ^2 | ( _ i ( t ) ) |^2 16 ^2 ( 1z_i ) ^2_i(t ) - 1 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the longitudinal momentum fraction flowing through the @xmath58channel .",
    "the function @xmath60 has an interpretation of a flux of @xmath44-quanta emitted by the hadron @xmath61 in the @xmath62 transition .",
    "correspondingly its integral n_i / c = _ 0 ^ 1 dz_i f_i / c ( z_i ) shall be addressed as the number of @xmath44quanta in @xmath63 .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath58channel pion exchange born - term to the production of leading neutrons reads @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the pionic regge - trajectory , @xmath66gev@xmath67 , @xmath68 is the @xmath69 cm - energy squared , and @xmath70 . furthermore @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is the phenomenological vertex form factor that accounts for the finite size of particles involved and/or off - shell effects .",
    "because of the proximity of the physical pion pole , the reggeization effects , i.e. the departure of @xmath74 from @xmath75 are marginal and one can use @xmath76 for the on  mass shell pion .",
    "the analogous formula for the @xmath77 production reads : @xmath78 where we introduced @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath71 with @xmath81 .",
    "again @xmath82 is the vertex form factor , a phenomenological quantity , that has a priori no simple relation to its counterpart in eq .",
    "( [ pi_nuc ] ) . integrating eqs.([pi_nuc],[pi_del ] ) over @xmath83 we get z d ^ ( ) dz(pp n x ) = d2 _ ^p n ( z,2 ) = 23 f_/n(1-z ) _",

    "tot^p(s_x ) .      for the moment",
    "let us focus on yet another issue , which did not receive due attention in the literature .",
    "the regge phenomenology outlined in section 2.1 allows to constrain the large-@xmath35 behaviour of the vertex functions from the experimental data on leading baryons . for smaller",
    "@xmath35 one must look into another constraint , here the light - cone wave function formalism offers an intimate relationship between the flux of mesons originating from a meson - baryon @xmath84-fock state and the corresponding flux of baryons .",
    "clearly , if @xmath85 denotes the probability to find in the @xmath84-fock state a meson @xmath86 carrying the ( light - cone ) momentum fraction @xmath87 and if @xmath88 has the analogous meaning of finding the baryon @xmath89 , carrying momentum @xmath90 , it must hold true that f_m / b(z ) = f_b / m(1-z ) .",
    "[ symm ] the probabilistic interpretation is obvious .",
    "the symmetry relation ( [ symm ] ) allows us to write the contribution from spectator pions to the cross section for the production of leading _ pions _ as : @xmath91 where we focussed solely on the leading pions originating from the @xmath9-fock state , a contribution from the @xmath10-states does not affect the following conclusions .    in the absence of a theoretical tool to directly calculate the form factor @xmath73",

    "we show the differential cross section @xmath92 for production of the @xmath93-mesons taken from the na27 @xmath20 experiment @xcite .",
    "the spectra of @xmath94 and @xmath95 from the same experiment show that the contribution from @xmath10 states is much smaller . shown",

    "the dotted curve shows the prediction from the model of holtmann and two of the authors @xcite . in this work",
    "a simple light - cone parametrization of the form factor had been adopted : @xmath96   = \\exp \\left [ { r_{lc}^2(t - m_\\pi^2 ) \\over ( 1-z ) } \\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] [ lcff ] here @xmath97 is the invariant mass of the @xmath9 fock state , and @xmath98 @xcite . in the spirit of the lightcone picture ,",
    "the formfactor ( [ lcff ] ) was meant to describe the low ",
    "mass components @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "if one streches this simple parametrization also to large @xmath101 then one would run into serious conflict with the experimental data on leading pions . as we shall see below",
    ", such an overprediction of the leading pion spectra leads to a related overprediction of the @xmath0 asymmetry at large @xmath5 .",
    "the dipole ( monopole ) parametrization of the light - cone form factor @xcite does not resolve the conflict with the na27 data .",
    "we have neglected here the absorptive corrections , but one would expect them to reduce the born term by at most a factor of @xmath102 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "clearly there is no real conflict between theory and experiment , one simply should not extrapolate to large @xmath103 the functional form of form factors designed for @xmath104 . reversing the attitude , one should look for parametrizations which are consistent with the leading pion data and to explore the resulting constraints from the leading pion data for predictions of the @xmath0 asymmetry in dis .",

    "we conclude that the forward pion data suggest that pions in the @xmath9 fock state of the nucleon wave function are rather `` soft '' , carrying longitudinal momenta of not more than @xmath109 .",
    "this is quite a subtle constraint on the tail of the @xmath9 two - body wave function and imposes the empirical bounds @xmath110 .",
    "let us proceed now to the neutron spectra . in what follows we shall use the gaussian parametrization with a cut - off parameter @xmath112 which does a reasonable job for the leading pion data ( see fig.([forward - pi ] ) ) . in figs .",
    "( [ blobel ] , [ high - energy ] ) we show the relevant data for the forward neutron production . in the analysis of these data",
    "we also improved on what has been done before .",
    "absorptive corrections to the @xmath58channel pion exchange are incorporated in terms of standard methods of the reggeon calculus in the quasi - eikonal formulation .",
    "the formalism is presented in @xcite and there is no need to repeat that here .    for the @xmath9 total cross section",

    "energy data in @xcite ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "we decompose the inclusive structure function for neutron production in terms of the pion and background contributions : @xmath115 we take into account two background contributions : exchange of the @xmath116-trajectories ( which are assumed exchange - degenerate following the regge theory wisdom ) and production of neutrons via the two - step processes @xmath117 .",
    "the deacy of @xmath1 s had been entirely neglected in all previous analyses except in ref.@xcite where it was shown to play an important role for leading proton production .",
    "the contribution of this mechanism to @xmath26 reaction is suppressed in comparison to @xmath118 reaction if the dominant mechanism of the @xmath1 production is an exchange by an isovector object . in the spirit of the regge phenomenology the contribution of @xmath4 to ( [ incl ] ) is parametrized as @xmath119 please note that the @xmath120 interference is negligible because of the different g - parity of @xmath16 and @xmath121 .",
    "the non spin - flip / spin - flip ratio is known to be small : @xmath122 @xcite . in accord with the regge phenomenology",
    "we take @xmath123 gev@xmath67 .",
    "there are no unique extrapolations from the @xmath4 particle pole to the reggeon exchange and @xmath124 remains a free parameter .",
    "our analysis of the neutron data in the large @xmath35 region suggests @xmath125 ( for the slope a typical value of @xmath126 was taken ) , which is similar to earlier estimates @xcite .    in evaluation of the background coming from the decay of fast @xmath1 resonances , one can either model the spectra of @xmath1 isobars , as done in ref.@xcite , or take any convenient parametrization , which reproduces the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath1 s lead to a significant shift in @xmath35 distributions , compared to initial @xmath1 distributions and only moderate modification in perpendicular momentum distributions .",
    "we have found that the spectrum of neutrons from @xmath1-decays can be parametrized to a good approximation by the following simple form @xmath127 with @xmath128 = 48 mb gev@xmath67 , @xmath129 .",
    "we find that there is substantial correlation between the parameter of the form factor and the strength of the absorptive corrections .",
    "the choice of the form factor parameter made above ( @xmath130 ) results in rather weak absorptive corrections which has only a weak effect of a @xmath131 reduction of the pion - exchange born - term , mildly depending on @xmath35 and @xmath83 .",
    "the description of the experimental data is excellent in general .",
    "the pion exchange is clearly seen to be the dominant mechanism in the region of @xmath132 and @xmath133 . because @xmath134 , the regge theory uniquely predicts the dominance of the reggeon exchange at @xmath135 and the experimental data confirm that .",
    "we improve upon an oversimplified treatment of the background in @xcite , where its contribution was modelled scaling up the pion exchange contribution , which underestimates the @xmath136 background at large z. in the earlier work of two of the authors @xcite , the @xmath16 ( particle- ) exchange had been included within the light - cone formalism with the form factors parametrized in the form following eq .",
    "( [ lcff ] ) which also underestimates the @xmath16 contribution at large @xmath35 .",
    "notice that especially in the region of large @xmath35 the inclusion of @xmath4 reggeons leads to much improved description as compared to the previous calculations @xcite where only the pion exchange did contribute at large @xmath35 .",
    "the fluctuations in the theoretical curves in fig.[blobel ] are due to the use of experimental values of the cross sections .",
    "indeed the region of large z corresponds to rather small @xmath39 of the inclusive system @xmath40 , for example the peak at @xmath35 close to unity corresponds to the @xmath137resonance in pion - nucleon scattering .      by far less ideal",
    "is the situation with to the production of forward @xmath1 s .",
    "experimental data is scarce , and if available often of rather poor quality .",
    "many sets of data suffer from substantial ambiguities from the nonresonant @xmath9 background subtraction ( a factor @xmath140 uncertainty is typical , see for instance @xcite ) and can not be used in the analysis .",
    "we do not have at hand measurements of double differential cross sections , that would allow us a meaningful determination of the @xmath83-dependence of the individual mechanisms .",
    "in particular the data is not sufficient to make any quantitative statement on the role of absorptive corrections .",
    "nonetheless the experimental data provide valuable bounds on the @xmath2 form factor which translate into substantial constraints on the @xmath10 contribution to the @xmath6 asymmetry .    in fig.[delta ]",
    "we show the @xmath83-integrated cross section @xmath141 from two cern experiments obtained by the abcdhw @xcite and lebc - ehs @xcite collaborations .",
    "the upper bound to the pion exchange can be obtained by adjusting the parameter of the form factor in eq.([pi_del ] ) to the cern data @xcite .",
    "based on the regge factorization , we evaluate the background from the @xmath16 and @xmath121 reggeon exchanges as follows . the experimental data on the two - body reaction @xmath142 exhibit a deep minimum of the differential cross section at @xmath143 , which is consistent with a pure @xmath144-transition @xcite .",
    "the related data on the @xmath145 charge exchange reaction show a similar dominance of the m1 transition in the @xmath146 vertex .",
    "therefore we take the following parametrization for the @xmath4 contribution : @xmath147 a careful inspection of two - body charge - exchange reactions @xmath148 and @xmath149 in a broad range of energy suggests ( assuming regge factorization ) that the @xmath150-coupling strength should be about a factor @xmath151 larger than that for the @xmath152 case .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath153 .",
    "consequently , the regge phenomenology offers a parameter  free evaluation of the @xmath4 exchange in production of leading @xmath1 s in terms of the @xmath4 exchange background to the production of leading neutrons . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this relationship has not been used before . consistently with the two - body reactions we take here the same slope parameter @xmath154 as for the neutron production .",
    "the contribution of the reggeon exchange is shown in fig.[delta ] as the dotted line .",
    "as can be seen from the figure it exhausts a significant fraction of the spectra leaving less room for the pion exchange contribution .",
    "let us return to the estimate of the pion exchange contribution which we take in the form according to eq.([pi_del ] ) with an exponential form factor @xmath155 .",

    "only a lower limit on @xmath156 can be obtained by comparing the sum of the reggeon exchange and pion exchange contributions @xmath157 to the experimental data @xcite .",

    "the corresponding upper limit of the pion exchange contribution is shown by the dashed line in fig.[delta ] .",
    "the pion exchange contribution found here is even smaller than in ref.@xcite and excludes the scenario with large @xmath10 component discussed in @xcite as a possible explanation of the restoration of @xmath29 symmetry at intermediate bjorken-@xmath5 observed in @xcite .",
    "this will have important consequences for the gottfried sum rule violation and @xmath6 asymmetry .",
    "a digression into unitarity relations and/or the extended agk rules is in order before we proceed with implications of the above analyses of inclusive reactions for the partonic structure of protons as seen in dis .",
    "as has been demonstrated in the previous section the reggeon exchanges may contribute significantly to individual inclusive channels and definitely influence the production of leading baryons .",
    "the impact of specific inclusive channels on the total cross section ( total photoabsorption cross section for dis ) is controlled by unitarity .",

    "there is still another interesting spin off of the present analysis . as discussed in section 2 the reggeon exchange contribution and",
    "decays of the @xmath1 resonances constitute a sizeable background to the pionic contribution especially at large transverse momenta of leading nucleons .",
    "the same peripheral processes are at work in the production of leading neutrons in electron deep inelastic scattering at hera , where leading neutron tagged dis is presently studied experimentally as the method of determination of the pion structure function @xcite .",

    "[ background ] were performed for the hadronic reaction @xmath201 .",
    "they can , however , also be used as an estimate for the deep inelastic reaction @xmath202 .",
    "one should be aware of the fact , that this amounts to an implict assumption of @xmath203 certainly this relation is approximate and can be used as a guiding principle only .",
    "a better approximation is however beyond the present , rather phenomenological , understanding of reggeon exchanges .",
    "our phenomenological analysis suggests that in order to extract the pion structure function one should limit rather to low @xmath204 and/or low transverse momenta of neutrons .",
    "this is the region where the leading proton spectrometers of both h1 and zeus collaborations have the largest sensitivity . in order to identify the `` unwanted '' background",
    "one could make the analysis of the experimental data for different cuts in transverse momentum .",
    "the nusea e866 experiment provided the first detailed mapping of the @xmath5-dependence of the @xmath205 asymmetry in the proton sea . while confirming the global features of the asymmetry predicted by the meson cloud picture , the large@xmath5 behaviour of these data called for revisiting the model adding more constraints from applications of the same model to hadronic inclusive reactions .",
    "specifically , in this paper we demonstrated that the experimental data on fragmentation of protons into leading pions impose useful constraints onto the pion iduced @xmath205 asymmetry such that the asymmetry must be negligibly small at @xmath206 in perfect consistency with the nusea findings .",
    "our reanalysis has been based on a unified treatment of inclusive production of leading nucleons and @xmath1 s in hadronic collisions and we paid special attention to the background to pion exchange from isovector @xmath207 exchanges . then , based on the extended agk unitarity rules , we related the contributions of different exchange mechanisms to inclusive @xmath208 cross section to the contribution of inelastic interaction ( dis ) on the exchanged objects to the total @xmath159 cross section ( dis structure function of the target hadron ) .",
    "we observe that the extended agk rules suggest a negligible contribution of dis off the exchanged @xmath209 to the @xmath205 asymmetry , leaving pions as the dominant source of the asymmetry . in numerical evaluation of the pion contribution to inclusive cross section , and eventually to the asymmetry",
    ", we made an extensive use of the regge factorization which allows to relate the @xmath4 exchange contribution to the leading neutron and @xmath1 production based on the regge phenomenology of two - body charge exchange reactions .",
    "one of the results is that the isovector @xmath4 reggeon exchanges exhaust a large fraction of inclusive leading @xmath1 production .",
    "the implication for the asymmetry is a substantial reduction of the contribution from the @xmath10 fock states which . as a result",
    "a reduction of the @xmath205 asymmetry by the contribution from the @xmath10 fock states in the proton turns out much weaker than evaluated before .",
    "we re - evaluated the gsr with the result @xmath210 \\simeq   0.13 - 0.18 $ ] and @xmath211 .    as a spin off of our evaluation of isovector reggeon exchange to leading neutron production ,",
    "we estimated which fraction of the inclusive leading neutrons in dis can be considered as due to dis off pions in the proton . in substantial part of the phase space covered by the forward / leading neutron calorimeters installed at hera by h1 and zeus @xcite , the purity of nuetron tagging of dis off pions can be estimated as 70 - 80 per cent .",
    "we feel that the corresponding uncertainties with the determination of the pion structure function do not preclude useful test of its @xmath212 evolution . to this effect",
    "we recall that judging from experimental data on the proton structure function , the pion structure function is expected to vary by the factor @xmath213 from @xmath214 to @xmath215 and by the factor @xmath216 from @xmath217 to @xmath218 at @xmath219 .",
