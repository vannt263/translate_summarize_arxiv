    "the prediction of electron - hole superfluidity in spatially separated electron and hole layers has captured the attention of the scientific community @xcite .",
    "the recent intense interest results from suggestions that some double - layer electron - hole systems offer the possibility of observing a coherent superfluid state up to temperatures approaching room temperature @xcite . despite long standing theoretical predictions @xcite and considerable experimental efforts @xcite such electron - hole superfluidity in double layered systems has not yet been observed in zero magnetic field .",
    "soon after the discovery of graphene @xcite , a two - dimensional lattice of carbon atoms @xcite , efforts were made to look for superfluidity in graphene - based double monolayer devices @xcite .",
    "although the early theoretical work on graphene double monolayers predicted room - temperature superfluidity @xcite , recent coulomb drag experiments have found no evidence of superfluidity @xcite .",
    "it is , in fact the linear energy dispersion of monolayer graphene that makes it difficult to access the most promising phase space region for superfluidity which is the region where the average strength of the coulomb interactions between carriers is much larger than their average kinetic energy .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the most favourable conditions for the electron - hole pairing are achieved at small interlayer separations @xmath0 , when @xmath1 . in this optimal limit",
    "the behavior of the system is determined by the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is the fermi energy and @xmath4 is the average coulomb energy for the mean inter - particle spacing in a sheet , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the charge carrier density in the sheet and @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the barrier . for monolayer graphene , @xmath8 , where the graphene fermi velocity @xmath9 ms@xmath10 , the fermi momentum @xmath11 , and the spin ( valley ) degeneracy for graphene is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "the dielectric constant for a hexagonal boron - nitride ( h - bn ) insulating barrier is @xmath15 @xcite , giving @xmath16 a very small ( and fixed ) value of only @xmath17 .",
    "calculations for double monolayer graphene unfortunately indicate that unless the parameter @xmath16 exceeds @xmath18 , screening of the electron - hole attractive interaction suppresses superfluidity at all practicable non - zero temperatures @xcite .",
    "this makes it very difficult to experimentally realize electron - hole superfluidity in double monolayer graphene @xcite .",
    "recently it has been suggested that a pair of bilayer graphene sheets is a promising system for observing high temperature superfluidity @xcite .",
    "in contrast with monolayer graphene , bilayer graphene has a quadratic dispersion at low energies so its parameter @xmath16 has an inverse density dependence @xmath19 that is familiar from metals and semiconductors .",
    "this density dependence makes it possible to experimentally access the strongly interacting regime at large @xmath16 simply by reducing @xmath6 .",
    "calculations for double bilayer graphene indicate that the interaction parameter @xmath16 must exceed a value similar to that for double monolayer graphene , @xmath20 , in order for the superfluid to condense at non - zero temperatures @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that outside the optimal region for superfluidity @xmath21 , superfluid state properties start to be sensitive also to the barrier thickness @xmath0 . with increasing @xmath22 ,",

    "we find this is a good approximation provided that the sheet s physical thickness is less than the thickness of the barrier separating the two @xmath28-layer sheets .",
    "this simplification is possible thanks to the strong hybridization of the electron states between the @xmath28-layers within a sheet @xcite . to check this",
    ", we compared the electron - hole coulomb pairing interaction for the hybridized electrons and holes in the case of double bilayer sheets of graphene , to this approximation of two thin sheets plus effective barrier thickness .",
    "we found for physical barrier thicknesses as small as the thickness of the bilayer sheet ( @xmath47 nm ) , that the resulting shift in the coulomb pairing interaction did not exceed 5% .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will denote by @xmath0 the effective barrier thickness .",
    "a construction similar to this is used with coupled double electron - hole quantum wells in gaas where the finite width of the quantum wells can be treated as a form factor multiplying the electron - hole coulomb interaction @xcite .",

    "we can neglect the intralayer correlations between electrons in the same sheet for two reasons . at high densities the electron - electron interactions are weak , while at low densities the compact pairs are weakly interacting .",
    "the satisfactory agreement for @xmath65 between the dqmc approach in ref . @xcite and our present mean - field approach confirm that the intralayer correlations have little effect on the superfluid properties for @xmath65 , consistent with the conclusion drawn by comparing the gaps reported in fig .  2 of ref .",

    "the suppression of screening permits cooper pairs to form .",
    "however for both double monolayer and double bilayer graphene , unless the values of the interaction parameter @xmath16 exceeds @xmath70 , the screening remains too strong for superfluidity to occur at any practicable zero temperature @xcite .",
    "when @xmath18 , the screening has become sufficiently suppressed by the opening of the superfluid gap that the self - consistent cooper pairing can be strong . at finite temperature , the underlying physics leading to the superfluid transition is that for strong electron - hole pairing the fluctuations of the order parameter determine a ( pseudo)gap at the critical temperature of the same order as the zero temperature superfluid gap .",
    "this large pseudogap should lead to a suppression of the screening similar to the suppression at zero temperature caused by the superfluid gap .",

    "[ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "the reason is that in the relevant density range , the effective mass @xmath102 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 is larger than the effective mass @xmath103 for @xmath24 .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the @xmath58 superfluid density for @xmath104 as compared with the @xmath24 case .",
    "the larger @xmath102 arise from the different band curvatures , and they partially compensate both amplification effects in the pairing gap and also the increased suppression of coulomb screening caused by the van hove singularities present in the dos for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . if we increase the number of layers above @xmath26 , we expect these compensating effects will increase , making further net gains in @xmath89 less significant .",

    "[ fig4](b ) that changing from an @xmath24 to an @xmath26 sample with the same @xmath105 nm , has the effect of doubling @xmath85 . therefore in double quadlayer",
    "graphene heterostructures at currently experimentally attainable densities , @xmath106 @xmath87 , transition temperatures can approach temperatures of the order of 40 k. this strongly suggests that electron - hole superfluidity leading to counter - flow superconductivity should be readily detectable in such samples using current technologies .",
    "the superfluid transition should persist to higher temperatures than possible coherent states in one of the graphene sheets .",
    "this is because the superfluidity is driven by the attractive electron - hole interaction between layers which will dominate over the repulsive electron - electron interactions within a layer .",
    "furthermore , with small effective barrier thicknesses @xmath107 nm , the mean electron - hole spacing in the pairs is much smaller than @xmath34 for the range of densities we are considering .",
    "thus the electron - hole pairing interaction will be much stronger than the corresponding electron - electron repulsion .",
    "the superfluid phenomena that we have been considering are not affected by disorder for the following reasons .",
    "reference @xcite states that disorder will not destroy superfluidity for sufficiently low impurity concentrations @xmath108 satisfying the condition @xmath109 . with graphene - hbn interfaces , @xmath108 can be @xmath110 @xmath87 @xcite , so that even for wide barriers , @xmath111 nm , the value of @xmath112 . at the onset densities for superfluidity we are already in the crossover regime , resulting in values of @xmath113 .",
    "thus all the samples we consider are well within the condition for negligible effects of disorder specified in ref .",
    "furthermore , even at the highest densities for which finite - temperature superfluidity occurs , we are already in the crossover regime with large superfluid gaps @xmath114 mev .",
    "et al . _ @xcite find that for superfluid gaps greater than a few mev , the level of fluctuations found in h - bn substrates is insufficient to destroy the electron - hole superfluidity .",
    "( it is also interesting to note that efimkin _",
    "et al._@xcite quote a minimum superfluid transition temperature of 19.8 k in the weakly - interacting bcs limit in the related system of coupled electron - hole graphene monolayers even with a disorder concentration which is an order of magnitude greater than our @xmath110 @xmath87 . ) finally , we recall that the fluctuations of the chemical potential @xmath36 associated with disorder @xcite are in one - to - one correspondence with density fluctuations . in the crossover regime ,",
    "@xcite showed that superfluid properties are insensitive to imbalances in the electron and hole densities less than 30% .",
    "this is because the sizeable smearing of the fermi surfaces means that perfect matching of the fermi surfaces is not necessary to stabilize superfluidity in the crossover regime .    in summary ,",
    "we predict enhanced electron - hole superfluidity at temperatures up to @xmath115 k in double few - layer sheets of graphene with large carrier densities as high as @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "an important element of the physical mechanism is that increasing the number of graphene layers in each sheet has the effect of greatly enhancing the density of states ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) . this enhancement projects the sheets into the strongly interacting regime , leading to strong electron - hole pairing at large accessible densities . over the full range of system parameters considered , we established that disorder effects will play a minor role on superfluid properties .",

    "the chemical potential becomes negative and the screening bubble is strongly suppressed everywhere .",
    "it is only close to the onset density that the screening bubble becomes sufficiently large for it to kill the superfluidity for all the @xmath28 we have considered . for @xmath104 , panels [ figs1](c ) and [ figs1](d ) , the absolute values of the screening bubble increase for all wave - vectors due to the enhanced density of states ( dos ) for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to the screening , the enhancement of the dos affects the gap equation .",
    "there is an amplification of the electron - hole pairing , leading to the enhancement of the superfluid gap seen in fig . 3 in the main text ."
