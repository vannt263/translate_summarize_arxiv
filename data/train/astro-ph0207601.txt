    "the identification of hydrogen in an early - time spectrum quickly defined it as a type ii event ( nakano et al .",

    "there have been two previous investigations of sn  1999gi . in the first ,",
    "leonard & filippenko ( 2001 ) examine a single epoch of optical spectropolarimetry of sn  1999gi taken 107 days after discovery .",
    "they find an extraordinarily high degree of linear polarization , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the highest level of polarization observed in the optical bandpass .",
    "if intrinsic to sn  1999gi , such polarization implies an enormous departure from spherical symmetry ( hflich 1991 ) .",
    "however , leonard & filippenko ( 2001 ) conclude that the majority of the polarization is likely due to interstellar dust , and is not intrinsic to the sn . from photometry reported in various iau circulars , leonard & filippenko ( 2001 )",

    "2001 ) , show great spectral similarity , suggesting that they may have been quite similar events .    in the second study ,",
    "smartt et al . ( 2001 ; hereafter s01 ) examine pre - explosion archival _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images of ngc  3184 and use the lack of a progenitor - star detection in the pre - discovery frame , along with an estimated distance of @xmath16 mpc , to set an upper limit on the absolute magnitude of the progenitor for sn  1999gi .",
    "this is then translated into an upper mass limit of @xmath17 for the progenitor of sn  1999gi through comparison with stellar evolution models .",
    "a subsequent reanalysis of the same data by smartt et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter s02 ) , using improved models , confirms this limit . since stars with initial mass @xmath18 are not expected to undergo core collapse ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1986 , and references therein ) , this upper bound sets very tight constraints on the possible mass of the progenitor , a fact that has important implications for the nature of the progenitors of sne ii - p .",

    "in particular , the recent analysis by l02 of sn  1999em , a strikingly similar event to sn  1999gi , is frequently referenced .",
    "we obtained 30 epochs of  photometry for sn 1999gi , 26 of them taken with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) and 4 with the 1.2 m telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) .",

    "all exposures with the mosaic were made on the same ccd ( chip 3 ) , and our observations were taken in a @xmath27 binned mode , so that the resulting images were sampled at @xmath28 per pixel .",
    "the seeing , estimated by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of stars on the ccd frame , generally ranged from @xmath29 to @xmath30 at kait , and between @xmath31 to @xmath29 at flwo .",

    "the 4 `` local standards '' identified in the field of sn  1999gi were used to measure the relative sn brightness on non - photometric nights .",
    "we reduced the data according to the procedure detailed by l02 , except that instead of using point - spread function ( psf ) fitting to measure the sn s brightness we employed the more accurate technique of galaxy subtraction ( e.g. , filippenko et al .",
    "1986 ; richmond et al .",
    "1995 ) . to use this technique , an image of the host galaxy without the sn ( i.e.",
    ", a `` template '' image of the galaxy , taken either before the explosion or after the sn has faded beyond detection ) is subtracted from the images containing the sn , with special care taken to match the alignment , intensity , and psfs of the images with and without the sn present .",
    "since we did not possess deep filtered pre - explosion images of ngc  3184 , we obtained the templates on 17 january 2002 with the nickel 1 m reflector at lick observatory .",
    "the nickel telescope utilizes a loral @xmath33 pixel ccd , which we binned @xmath23 to yield a plate scale of @xmath34 per pixel .",
    "the absolute calibration of the field was accomplished on the three photometric nights of 2000 april 3 ( with kait ) and 2002 january 17 and 18 ( with the nickel 1 m ) , by observing several fields of landolt ( 1992 ) standards over a range of airmasses in addition to the sn  1999gi field .",
    "the calibration of two of the local standards was further verified against the photometric calibrations by s. benetti ( personal communication ; star `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and b. skiff ( star `` c '' in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and found to agree to within the reported uncertainties",

    "the transformation coefficients for the kait data to the standard johnson - cousins ( johnson et al .",
    "1966 for @xmath36 ; cousins 1981 for @xmath37 ) systems are those of l02 . for the flwo data with chip 3 of the 4shooter , we derived color terms from five photometric nights ( 1999 december 9 , 2000 january 3 , january 5 , february 7 , and february 16 ) of @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the instrumental and  the standard johnson - cousins magnitudes .",
    "the terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the differences between the zero - points of the instrumental and standard magnitudes , determined for each observation by measuring the offset between the instrumental and standard magnitudes and colors of the local standard stars .    to transform the photometry to the standard johnson - cousins system we took the weighted mean of the values individually derived from the four calibrator stars . since star `` c '' was saturated in nearly all of the flwo observations , the flwo photometry was usually derived using only three stars .",
    "the results of our photometric observations are given in table 2 and shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the reported uncertainties come from the photometric and transformation errors added in quadrature ; in most cases , the total error was dominated by the uncertainty in the transformation .",
    "the light curves of sn  1999gi indicate a fairly rapid initial rise followed by a clear plateau of nearly constant brightness in  that lasts until about 100 days after discovery . to estimate the date of maximum in the @xmath32 and @xmath42 bandpasses ( maximum brightness in @xmath43 and @xmath44 is not sharply defined and actually comes significantly after the initial rise ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for detail of the light curves near maximum light ) , we fit spline functions to the data around the peak . to estimate the uncertainty in the date of maximum we measured the @xmath35 spread in the derived dates of maximum for 1000 sets of synthetic photometric data , in which each epoch s photometry near the peak was replaced with a value randomly chosen from a gaussian - weighted distribution centered on the values given in table  2 and characterized by a standard deviation equal to the uncertainty listed in table  2 . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that @xmath45 mag occurred on hjd 2,451,526.2 @xmath46 ( 1999 december @xmath47 ) , which is @xmath48 days after discovery . for @xmath42",
    "we find @xmath49 mag on hjd 2,451,530.0 @xmath50 ( 1999 december @xmath51 ) , which is @xmath52 days after discovery .",
    "the decline in the @xmath32 band over the first 100 days after maximum light is @xmath53 mag , which definitively establishes sn  1999gi as a type ii - p event according to the definition by patat et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , used to discriminate sne  ii - p ( @xmath54 mag ) from sne  ii - l ( @xmath55 mag ) . the average apparent @xmath42-band brightness during the plateau , defined as the unweighted mean of the values from days @xmath56 after the explosion ( determined by the epm analysis in ",
    "[ sec : sn1999giepmdistance ] ) , is @xmath57 mag .",
    "the photometric behavior of sn  1999gi is extremely similar to that of sn  1999em , with both having plateau durations of @xmath58 days after @xmath32-band maximum as well as similar @xmath32-band decline rates ( see l02 ) .",
    "in fact , once an allowance is made for a small reddening difference ( @xmath59}}\\equiv ( { e{[{{b}}{\\rm -}{{v}}]}}_{\\rm 99gi } - { e{[{{b}}{\\rm -}{{v}}]}}_{\\rm 99em } ) = 0.15 $ ] mag ) , the color evolution of the two objects is nearly identical ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the optical `` double peak '' noted by l02 for sn  1999em , in which a second local maximum follows the initial peak ( @xmath60 days later for the @xmath42-band in sn  1999em ) , is also discernable in the photometry of sn  1999gi ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "however , the second peak is certainly not as obvious as it was in the photometry of sn  1999em , a situation likely exacerbated by the relatively sparse photometric coverage obtained during this period for sn  1999gi compared with sn  1999em .",
    "table 3 lists the spectral observations of sn  1999gi .",
    "all one - dimensional sky - subtracted spectra were extracted optimally ( horne 1986 ) in the usual manner .",
    "each spectrum was then wavelength and flux calibrated , as well as corrected for continuum atmospheric extinction and telluric absorption bands ( wade & horne 1988 ; bessell 1999 ; matheson et al .",
    "2000 ) . with the exception of the very first spectrum ( day 0.61 , 300 s observation ) ,",
    "all spectra were observed near the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) , so the spectral shape should be quite accurate .",
    "-1.in -2.in    the spectral evolution of sn  1999gi during the first 168 days of its development is shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , and is very similar to that seen for sn  1999em ( l02 ; see also leonard & filippenko 2001 , fig .",
    "as is typical for sne ii - p , the early - time spectrum is characterized by a smooth thermal continuum with superposed hydrogen balmer and @xmath61 p - cygni lines . during the plateau phase ,",
    "numerous metal - line p - cygni features complicate the spectrum ( see l02 for a complete identification of these features ) . emission - dominated lines then become prominent as sn  1999gi drops off the plateau and makes the transition to the nebular phase .    to estimate the recession velocity of sn  1999gi we measured the peak wavelength of the narrow h@xmath62  line resulting from the superposed region . from this",
    ", we determine that @xmath63 km s@xmath11 , where the uncertainty is the @xmath35 spread in the velocities derived from the individual spectra . this velocity is to be compared with the value reported for ngc  3184 by strauss et al .",
    "( 1992 ) of @xmath64 km s@xmath11 , which was derived from narrow emission in the central @xmath65 of the galaxy . since sn  1999gi is quite far away from the center of ngc  3184 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , our velocity is likely a more accurate estimate of the true velocity of the sn .",
    "we therefore use it to derive all photospheric velocities in the epm analysis in   [ sec : sn1999giepmdistance ] ; ultimately , using the larger strauss et al .",
    "( 1992 ) value would result in a final epm distance that is @xmath66 larger than that derived with our lower recession velocity .",
    "the very early - time h@xmath67  and @xmath68 line profiles of sn  1999gi are shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] , and warrant special comment . in early - time spectra of sn  1999em ,",
    "baron et al . ( 2000 ) identify `` complicated p - cygni '' profiles , in which the usual p - cygni absorptions for h@xmath67  and @xmath68 are accompanied by a second absorption at much higher velocity . from comparison with theoretical models , baron et al . ( 2000 ) conclude that these high - velocity absorption features result from non - local thermodynamic equilibrium effects that produce two line - forming regions in the expanding atmosphere .",
    "leonard et al . ( 2001 ) also identify these high - velocity features in an early spectrum of sn  1999em .",
    "in addition , l02 propose that complex p - cygni profiles of strong lines may also explain a number of previously unidentified absorption features in spectra of sn  1999em at later times , during the photospheric and early nebular phases ; detailed modeling , however , is required to confirm these identifications .",
    "the early - time absorption features observed in the spectra of sn  1999em were rather subtle , and left open the question of whether they were true p - cygni features containing both a dip and a peak .",
    "as clearly seen in figure  [ fig:6 ] , similar high - velocity features are also evident in the early spectra of sn  1999gi . furthermore , the h@xmath67  profiles from days 3 and 4 reveal that the high - velocity feature is indeed characterized by a true p - cygni profile .",
    "the earliest spectrum , from day 1 , is particularly interesting . in @xmath68",
    "there is just a hint of the higher - velocity component in addition to the `` normal '' line feature .",
    "near the expected location of the high - velocity feature in h@xmath67  ( i.e. , based on its position in the spectra from days 3 and 4 ) , there is a strong emission feature which , if identified with h@xmath67 , extends out to nearly @xmath10 km s@xmath11 .",
    "if this association is confirmed by detailed models , it would demonstrate the existence of very high velocity material in the outer envelope of sn  1999gi at these early times .",
    "although the `` normal , '' lower - velocity component of h@xmath67  is likely present at this early epoch , it is clearly much weaker than the higher - velocity component . , but the identification is ambiguous since the lower - velocity absorption of h@xmath69 is expected at nearly the same location . ] interestingly , near the expected location of h@xmath62 , we find that while the `` normal '' profile is observed at all epochs ( including day 1 ) , a high - velocity feature is _ not _ apparent in the spectra from days 1 , 3 , and 4 . at later times , during the photospheric and early nebular phases , the high - velocity absorption features attributed by l02 to h@xmath67 , d , and h@xmath62  in spectra of sn  1999em are also seen in the spectra of sn  1999gi : they are consistently detected in h@xmath67  and d at @xmath70 km s@xmath11  through the spectrum on day 111 , and are obvious in h@xmath62  ( at @xmath71 km s@xmath11 ) in the spectra on days 32 and 35 .",
    "further detailed modeling is urged in order to better establish the physical mechanism behind these intriguing features .",
    "sn  1999gi has minimal galactic reddening , @xmath72  = 0.017 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) . in order to estimate the _ total _ reddening ( or to set limits on how high it can be )",
    ", we shall compare the results obtained from the following five independent techniques .",
    "_ compare the early - time spectral shape with blackbody functions .",
    "_ as discussed by eastman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , an upper reddening limit can be established for an sn ii - p by comparing its very early - time spectral shape with an arbitrarily hot blackbody function .",
    "the basic idea is that at very high temperatures ( i.e. , early times for an sn ii - p ) the optical continuum is on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the planck spectrum , whose slope is quite insensitive to temperature ( i.e. , in the limit @xmath73 ) . if a hot , early - time spectrum ( with accurate continuum shape ) is available ( the earlier , the better , since cooler spectra will result in a less - restrictive upper bound ) , one can determine the maximum allowable reddening by dereddening the spectrum to the point at which even an unphysically hot blackbody function ( say , @xmath74 k ) can no longer fit the continuum . as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] , the inability of a blackbody at any temperature to match the continuum shape of sn  1999gi when dereddened by @xmath75 mag effectively establishes this as an upper limit for the reddening of sn  1999gi .",
    "the true reddening of the sn , of course , is likely to be substantially lower .",
    "for instance , the more reasonable color temperature of @xmath76 k is shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] to correspond with a reddening of @xmath77 mag .",
    "_ compare the color evolution of sn  1999gi with sn  1999em .",
    "_ schmidt , kirshner , & eastman ( 1992 ) demonstrate that the color evolution of the 5 sne ii - p in their study is quite similar , with the observed discrepancies consistent with reddening differences among the objects .",
    "although still limited by the small number of well - studied examples , it is tempting to posit that all sne ii - p undergo similar color evolution , at least through the end of the recombination phase . if this is so , then it should be possible to estimate ( and set hard upper limits on ) the reddening of sn  1999gi by comparing it with sn  1999em , which was extensively modeled by baron et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who set a firm upper limit of @xmath78 mag and estimated the likely reddening to be @xmath79 mag .",
    "( the epm analyses of hamuy et al . 2001 and l02 are also consistent with low reddening for sn  1999em . )",
    "the similar color evolution shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] , where the data for both objects are plotted with respect to the date of @xmath32-band maximum , suggests a reddening difference between the two objects of @xmath80 mag , implying that @xmath81 mag , with @xmath82 mag serving as a hard upper limit .",
    "of course , this analysis assumes the intrinsic color evolution of the two objects to be identical with respect to the date of maximum brightness .",
    "if the analysis is instead done with respect to the explosion date ( derived from the epm analyses ) , then the best agreement is found for @xmath83 mag , in which case @xmath84 mag then becomes the upper bound .",
    "we therefore conclude that the comparison of the color evolution of sn  1999gi with that of sn  1999em implies a reddening of @xmath85 mag for sn  1999gi .",

    "nevertheless , it is useful to compare the predictions that these relations make with the results of the other , perhaps more accurate , techniques .    to derive the d equivalent width in the spectrum of sn  1999gi , we first co - added the normalized region around the d lines in the 5 earliest spectra , which had the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the region of interest ( i.e. , we combined the spectra up through and including the one taken on day 31.61 ; the spectrum from day 34.60 was corrupted by a cosmic - ray spike in the d region , and the high s / n spectrum from day 106.59 could not be used with confidence since the d absorption occurred very near the maximum of an sn feature , making proper continuum placement difficult ) . from this composite spectrum",

    "the barbon ( 1990 ) relation yields @xmath94 mag , and the munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) relation gives @xmath95 mag . from a similarly constructed composite spectrum centered on the expected location of the d lines in the milky way ( i.e. , at zero velocity ) , the absence of detectable absorption implies an upper limit on the total equivalent width due to galactic gas of @xmath96   through equation  4 of leonard & filippenko ( 2001 ) ; this translates into an upper reddening limit of @xmath97 mag from the barbon ( 1990 ) relation , which concurs with the value given by schlegel et al .",

    "( 2 ) all sne ii - p may not evolve in a similar manner , and sn  1999gi and sn  1999em may not have been identical events . ( 3 ) sodium is known to be only a fair tracer of dust , and our low - resolution spectra do not resolve the individual absorption systems that contribute to the d lines , making it impossible to estimate the effect of line saturation .",
    "( 4 & 5 ) the reddening along the specific line - of - sight to sn  1999gi may differ from the average reddening to the ob association and/or the reddening to specific association members ( see , e.g. , yadav & sagar 2001 ) .",
    "nonetheless , taken together the general agreement of all the estimates makes a compelling case for low reddening to sn  1999gi , with @xmath105 mag ( comparison with sn  1999em ) ; @xmath106 mag ( d absorption ) ; @xmath107 mag ( reddening to ob association ) ; and @xmath108 ( reddening to region ) , and an upper reddening limit of @xmath0 mag coming from the analysis of the early - time continuum shape .",
    "if the color evolution of sn  1999gi is intrinsically the same as that of sn  1999em with respect to the time of maximum light , then we can restrict the upper bound even further , to @xmath109 mag . in   [ sec : sn1999giepmdistance ] , we shall see that additional evidence for low reddening to sn  1999gi comes from the epm analysis itself , which predicts @xmath110 mag .",
    "taking the simple average of the five specific reddening estimates ( i.e. , including the epm estimate derived in   [ sec : sn1999giepmdistance ] , but not incorporating the upper limit derived from the blackbody comparison ) yields @xmath111 mag , where the uncertainty is the @xmath35 spread of the individual reddening estimates from the mean .",

    "one strength of the epm technique is that the derived distance should be rather robust to uncertainty in reddening since both @xmath153 and @xmath32 in equation  [ eq:5 ] have similar dependencies : higher reddening decreases both the observed flux and the color temperature in a smooth , regular manner .",
    "however , one must also consider the temperature dependence of the dilution factor , @xmath123 , which behaves quite differently for the various filter combinations . for the @xmath36 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 filter combinations , @xmath123 is rather insensitive to color temperature for @xmath154 k ( see eastman et al . 1996 ;",
    "hamuy et al . 2001 ) .",
    "as the temperature drops below 8000 k , @xmath123 rises for all three filter combinations , and the strength of the temperature dependence varies considerably , from a rather weak dependence in @xmath147 to stronger dependencies in @xmath146 and , especially , @xmath36 .",
    "how might we expect uncertainty in the reddening to affect the derived distances and explosion dates for our data set ?",
    "our spectral measurements of sn  1999gi essentially sample two different epochs , one very early ( @xmath155 days after discovery ) and the other later during the plateau ( @xmath156 days ) . at the early times ,",
    "the color temperatures derived from all three filter combinations is greater than 8000 k ; we therefore expect little change in @xmath123 for different assumed reddenings at these times .",
    "for the later set of data points , however , @xmath157 k , and @xmath123 will be quite sensitive to reddening changes , especially in the @xmath36 and @xmath146 filter combinations .",
    "now , the slope ( distance ) and @xmath130-intercept ( time of explosion ) of the line described by equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) are affected somewhat differently by changes in @xmath112 .",
    "a uniform change in the overall _ level _ of @xmath112 at each epoch ( i.e. , an offset ) will only affect the @xmath130-intercept ( @xmath158 ) . a differential change in @xmath112 , on the other hand , will affect both the the @xmath130-intercept and the slope ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the rapidly changing values of @xmath123 with @xmath118 in the @xmath36 and @xmath146 filter combinations should therefore lead to a relatively greater dependence on reddening for the derived distances in these filter combinations than for @xmath147 . on the other hand , since all filter combinations are sensitive to the more uniform changes in @xmath112 brought about by changes in @xmath153 and @xmath32 , we might anticipate the derived explosion times to be more equally affected by reddening uncertainty in the 3 filter combinations .",
    "the epm distances and explosion times derived for @xmath36 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 as a function of assumed reddening are shown in figure  [ fig:8 ] ; to calculate the values we have limited the epm analysis to the first six spectral epochs ( see discussion below , and fig .  [ fig:9 ] ) . to give a sense of the formal uncertainty in the distance for each filter combination , @xmath35 ( statistical ) error bars sampling reddening increments of @xmath159 mag",

    "these errors represent the @xmath35 spread in the distances derived for each of the filter combinations from 1000 simulated sets of data characterized by the values and uncertainties given in table  4 .",
    "as anticipated , distances derived using the @xmath36 and @xmath146 filter sets are more sensitive to changes in reddening than are distances determined using the @xmath147 filter combination .",
    "the convergence of the distances derived using the different filter combinations at @xmath160 mag agrees with the conclusion of   [ sec : reddening ] that sn  1999gi suffers little extinction , and builds further confidence that the epm technique itself may be used to estimate sn ii - p reddenings ( e.g. , hamuy et al .",
    "for the purpose of deriving the final epm distance and its uncertainty , we shall use the reddening value derived in   [ sec : reddening ] , @xmath111 mag , which represents the average of the epm - derived reddening along with the 4 other reddening estimates discussed in   [ sec : reddening ] .",
    "the value of @xmath158 in figure  [ fig:8 ] also shows somewhat better mutual consistency among the different filter combinations at lower reddenings , but there is no strong preference for a particular reddening value .",
    "the inconsistency among the different filter combinations for the derived explosion dates is troubling , and may result from the use of `` average '' dilution factors rather than a set custom made for sn  1999gi .",
    "we determine the final distance and time of explosion of sn  1999gi by taking the simple means of the values derived from the three filter combinations for @xmath77 mag , and find @xmath161 mpc and @xmath162 days before discovery ( @xmath163 10.02 , 10.84 , and 12.33 mpc and @xmath164 days , for the @xmath36 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 bandpasses , respectively ) .",
    "although it is difficult to assign a precise statistical error bar to this result , there are two identifiable sources that do contribute quantifiable uncertainty to the values of @xmath113 and @xmath131 .",
    "first , there is the @xmath35 spread in the values found from the three individual filter combinations for @xmath77 mag , which are @xmath165 mpc and @xmath166 days .",
    "the second source of uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the reddening estimate of @xmath167 mag .",
    "this uncertainty leads directly to an uncertainty in distance of @xmath168 mpc and an uncertainty in the explosion date of @xmath169 days .",
    "the final estimate of the statistical uncertainty is found by taking the quadrature sum of the two sources of error . from this , then , our best estimate of the distance and time of explosion of sn  1999gi is @xmath170 mpc and @xmath171 days before discovery .",
    "although the uncertainty is somewhat larger than the statistical error associated with the individual distances ( especially using the @xmath36 and @xmath146 filter combinations ) , we feel it more accurately reflects the overall uncertainty in the distance , since we have no _ a priori _ preference for any of the filter combinations , and our reddening estimate suffers from uncertainty as well .",
    "to give an idea of the relevant derived parameters , we list the dilution factor , photospheric angular size , and photospheric color temperature for @xmath77 mag in table  5 , and plot the values used in the epm analysis for this reddening in figure  [ fig:9 ] . in figure  [ fig:9 ]",
    "we see that the data obtained near the very end of the plateau ( @xmath172 days ; open circles ) are somewhat inconsistent with the earlier data ; this is probably due to the fact that the theoretical models of eastman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) include no spectra with color temperatures as low as those derived for sn  1999gi at these late times ( table  5 ) , and so the inferred dilution factors rely completely on extrapolation . at these low temperatures , the dilution factor , especially in @xmath36 and @xmath146 ,",
    "is changing very rapidly with temperature .",
    "the epm distance is therefore more securely obtained from the earlier epochs , and we thus have only used the data from the first six spectral epochs to derive the distance to sn  1999gi .",

    "finally , ( 6 ) determine which progenitor masses would have remained undetected given the detection threshold of the image . since more massive main - sequence stars generally result in brighter progenitors , it may be possible to set an upper mass limit for an undetected progenitor star through this approach .",

    "since stars less massive than @xmath202 are not expected to undergo core collapse , an upper mass limit of @xmath17 for the progenitor of sn  1999gi is highly restrictive , and narrows the range of possible progenitor masses to be essentially between @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "interestingly , for sn  1999em , s02 find it very difficult to reconcile the lack of a detection with the theoretically predicted final luminosities of the progenitor stars : given the stated limits , _ all _ stars with initial mass @xmath205 should have been detected .",
    "it is only by considering the _ uncertainty _ on the threshold limit ( @xmath206 dex ) that s02 are able to ( barely ) explain the non - detection , and then only for a very narrow range of possible progenitor masses , @xmath207 .",
    "we now reexamine the progenitor mass limit of sn  1999gi in light of our present study .",

    "using the techniques employed by s01 and s02 , but using our revised distance and reddening estimates , we arrive at a consistent value of @xmath217 as the upper mass limit for the progenitor of sn  1999gi , compared with the upper limit of @xmath17 derived by s01 and s02 . the increased upper limit results mainly from the larger distance derived through the epm than was assumed by the earlier analyses .",
    "it is unfortunate that the only progenitor stars thus far positively identified for type ii supernovae are for unusual events (   [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "clearly , the _ detection _ of a progenitor star in a pre - explosion image for an sn ii - p would have much to tell us about the late stages of stellar evolution for isolated massive stars , and would serve as a very useful check on the ability of models to accurately predict their final luminosity .",
    "however , since the uncertainty in the detection limits for sn  1999gi ( and sn  1999em as well ) is of the same order as the theoretically derived luminosity differences among the candidate progenitor stars , the ability of the smartt et al .",
    "technique to robustly discriminate among progenitors in the range @xmath218 is questionable .",
    "we present 15 optical spectra and 30 photometric epochs of sn  1999gi sampling the first 169 and 174 days since discovery , respectively , and derive its epm distance .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "sn  1999gi is a type ii - p event with a photometric plateau lasting until about 100 days after discovery .",
    "it reached @xmath32 maximum on 1999 december @xmath219 ( hjd 2,451,526.2 @xmath220 , or @xmath48 days after discovery ) , and achieved peak @xmath32 and @xmath42 magnitudes of @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively . overall , we find the photometric behavior of sn  1999gi to be extremely similar to that of sn  1999em .",
    "2 .   the very early - time spectra of sn  1999gi confirm the existence of the high - velocity absorption features in the profiles of h@xmath67  and @xmath68 that were first identified by baron et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in spectra of sn  1999em .",
    "the highest - velocity feature ( h@xmath67 , day 1 ) extends out to nearly @xmath10 km s@xmath11 , implying the existence of very high velocity material in the outer envelope of sn  1999gi at early times .",
    "these features are verified to be true p - cygni profiles , consisting of both an absorption trough and an emission peak in early - time spectra .",
    "the high - velocity features are not seen , however , in h@xmath62  at early times .",
    "by comparing the early - time spectral shape with blackbody functions we derive an upper limit on the reddening of sn  1999gi of @xmath0 mag ; comparison with the color evolution of sn  1999em suggests an even lower limit , of @xmath109 mag .",
    "other reddening estimates are consistent with these limits , and imply a somewhat lower reddening , @xmath111 mag , which we adopt as the preferred reddening value .",
    "our best estimate for the epm distance and explosion time of sn  1999gi is @xmath170 mpc and @xmath171 days prior to discovery .",
    "this distance is consistent with some recent distance estimates to ngc  3184 , but is @xmath223 shorter than the average of the cepheid distances derived to two putative group - member galaxies .",
    "the epm distance implies an average plateau brightness of @xmath224 mag , which is very similar to the value found for sn  1999em and consistent with the average plateau brightness found by l02 of @xmath225 mag for 9 photometrically confirmed sne ii - p with epm distances .",
    "following the analysis methods of s01 and s02 we derive a new upper mass limit for the progenitor of sn  1999gi of @xmath217 , which is substantially less restrictive than the original limit of @xmath226 found by s01 and s02 .",
    "the higher limit comes mainly from the longer distance derived through the epm , than was assumed by the earlier analyses .",
    "we thank alison coil and maryam modjaz for assistance with the observations , and georges paturel for a helpful correspondence regarding the leda database ( http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr ) , of which we made use .",
