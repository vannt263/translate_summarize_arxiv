    "discovery of @xmath0-ray flares from the crab nebula is among the foremost contributions to recent high - energy astrophysics .",
    "while it has now been five years since their announcement in 2011 @xcite , no longer wavelength counterparts have been established @xcite , and so the active region within the nebula remains unlocalized .",
    "the flares also present a formidable theoretical challenge because their power and duration can not be accounted for within conventional theories of charged particle acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "evidently , they are telling us something new  either about the nebula s anatomy , or the physics of strongly magnetized plasma , or perhaps both .    here",
    "we suggest crab flares are the signature of an intermittent pulsar wind .",
    "seen in this way , they provide empirical support for a turbulence resolution to the so - called @xmath3-problem , referring to uncertainty over the mechanism by which the pulsar s electromagnetic spin - down luminosity is diverted into particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pulsar wind plasma thus inherits spatial and temporal intermittencies that are characteristic of relativistic turbulence @xcite , and flares can be produced when exceptionally large coherent structures transit the wind termination shock .",
    "our central assertion is that free energy associated with the pulsar s alternating current ( `` striped wind '' ) destabilizes quickly , and is dissipated in the ensuing turbulent cascade .",
    "this view is supported by recent advances in the stability and reconnection processes of strongly magnetized plasma , @xcite , but differs with the conventional view that the striped wind is erased by steady magnetic reconnection through current layers that remain near equilibrium @xcite .",
    "essential features of a model follow from this assertion .",
    "first , we envision that synchrotron radiation is produced by supra - thermal electrons emerging from the wind zone into the compressed downstream magnetic field , so that photons may exceed the classical @xmath4{mev}$ ] limit throughout the duration of electron cooling times .",
    "second , we envision those electrons to be energized by turbulent dissipation in the flow well upstream of the wind termination shock .",
    "finally , we attribute observed @xmath0-ray variabilities to spatial intermittency of the upstream electron population ; flares are seen when a gust of wind particles ( henceforth a `` blob '' ) sweeps across the wind termination shock along the line of sight .",
    "we will show that a model having these basic features can account for the flare duration and energetics without invoking explosive conversion of magnetic energy into radiation .    in section [ sec : free - energy ] we summarize previous work on states of magnetized plasma resembling the striped wind . in section [ sec : linear - instabilities ] we estimate that current layers in the wind succumb quickly to linear instabilities . then in section [ sec : simulations ] we simulate their subsequent non - linear evolution in the force - free electrodynamics approximation , finding that stripes are fully engulfed by turbulence after about two comoving dynamical times . in section [ sec : causality ] we discuss freely decaying turbulence in a relativistically expanding background flow , and determine the maximum scale of coherent structures emerging from the wind region .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we use those results to develop a simplistic model for the crab nebula flares .",
    "the model requires a wind lorentz factor @xmath5 , a post - shock magnetic field strength of @xmath6{mg}$ ] , and can be falsified by observation of flares about 5 times more powerful than the april 2011 event . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss limitations of the model and follow - up work that may validate certain assumptions .",
    "turbulence in the pulsar wind feeds on the oscillating magnetic field , or `` stripes '' .",
    "the stripes arise by rippling of the equatorial current sheet as the pulsar s magnetic dipole vector circles its spin axis , and are generic to plasma winds sourced by oblique rotators @xcite . as seen in the local rest frame of wind particles , they are an abundant source of magnetostatic free energy . ) in all but infinitesimal volumes .",
    "such evolution conserves the system s ideal topological invariants in the sense of @xcite , while permitting conversion of magnetic energy into bulk motions and eventually heat . ] in earlier work , we found that such `` excited '' states of magnetized plasma were dynamically unstable @xcite , and promptly discharged their free energy through a turbulent cascade @xcite .",
    "the force - free equilibria ( @xmath7 ) we had considered were the short - wavelength taylor states @xcite which have uniform torsion @xmath8 .",
    "although stripes are different in that @xmath9 is non - uniform ( electrical current concentrates into thin layers around which the toroidal field switches sign ) , we will see in section [ sec : simulations ] that they similarly tend toward dynamical instability .",
    "turbulence can be induced by saturation of any small amplitude instability . here , we estimate the growth rate of linear tearing modes affecting current layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between domains of opposite magnetic polarity .",
    "the upshot is that tearing modes saturate fast , so our conclusions would not change if another instability grows faster .",
    "current layers in high lundquist number plasma tend to form plasmoids @xcite , or become strongly corrugated @xcite .",
    "our estimate here thus predicts how long current layers remain near equilibrium before such non - linear effects set in .",
    "the fastest growing tearing mode has a wavelength comparable to the comoving layer thickness @xmath10 , and a growth rate @xmath11 when the plasma is hot @xcite , where @xmath12 is the relativistic debye length .",
    "current layers collapse down to microscopic width @xmath13 @xcite , so @xmath14 .",
    "as measured in the pulsar frame the current layer thickness near the light cylinder was found by @xcite to be @xmath15{cm}$ ] .",
    "plasma near the base of the wind is launched outward with a lorentz factor @xmath16 in the case of the crab pulsar @xcite , so the comoving current layer thickness @xmath17 is tens of meters . the tearing rate is a factor @xmath18 slower in the pulsar frame , and it slows further as the current layer inflates @xmath19 ( charge density @xmath20 while @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 near the light cylinder , @xmath23{s^{-1}}$ ] . by comparison , the crab pulsar angular frequency @xmath24 . in principle",
    "the tearing mode could be suppressed by inflation of the layer . however",
    ", the ratio of @xmath25 to the layer expansion rate @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 independent of distance , so expansion may be safely neglected .",
    "the same also implies that tearing modes complete @xmath28 exponential foldings in the vicinity of the wind s base .",
    "we conclude that linear instability only characterizes the striped wind at extremely small radii @xmath29 , and that evolution throughout the vast majority of its flight to the termination shock takes place in the non - linear regime .      in order to illustrate non - linear evolution of the striped wind",
    ", we have carried out time - dependent numerical simulations in the plasma rest frame .",
    "we assume that the wind s @xmath3 parameter is sufficiently high that the force - free electrodynamics ( ffe ) approximation is appropriate .",
    "ffe corresponds to the limiting case of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) where electromagnetic contributions to the stress - energy tensor dominate those of matter .",
    "use of continuum rather than fully kinetic formalism is justified by the same argument given in section [ sec : linear - instabilities ] , namely that each wavelength contains millions to billions of plasma skin depths .",
    "ffe is formulated as maxwell s equations , together with the ohm s law @xmath30 that follows from imposing perfect conductivity @xmath31 and the force - free condition @xmath32 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use a numerical scheme that is fourth order accurate in space and time .",
    "details are given in @xcite .    .",
    "time is measured since the onset of non - linear evolution , in units of the comoving light - travel time between stripes @xmath33 .",
    "different curves show the same model at different grid resolution .",
    "the numbered blue circles correspond to the columns of figure [ fig : images].,width=340 ]    current layers in a striped wind collapse to an equilibrium supported by gas pressure as in the solution of @xcite .",
    "since ffe neglects gas pressure , we instead construct our initial data as a sequence of force - free rotational current layers , that are in equilibrium by virtue of uniform magnetic pressure ( @xmath34 ) and vanishing tension density ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "all such force - free equilibrium fields may be parameterized by the angle @xmath36 of the magnetic field vector in the transverse plane , as a function of longitudinal position @xmath37 ( where @xmath37 is measured as a fraction of the domain length @xmath38 ) ; @xmath39 . in order to model current layers having width @xmath40 ,",
    "we choose @xmath36 to increase over the domain in a series of @xmath41 steps , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a `` smoothed '' heaviside step function . even though our current layers are force - free rather than supported by gas pressure , they still admit a small - amplitude instability not unlike the tearing mode .",
    "a full description of that instability is outside the present scope ; for our purposes it suffices to say that its growth rate was seen to increase as @xmath40 decreases and that saturation is reached after a few dynamical times @xmath44 .",
    "once non - linear effects set in , the limited range of length scales becomes tolerable due to universality of the turbulent cascade with respect to small - scale closure , which we will give evidence for momentarily .",
    "our simulations are run on the triple periodic domain of size @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and the grid resolution was @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "the current layer width @xmath40 was varied between @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the stripe wavelength @xmath52 .",
    "we neglect transverse stretching , as well as longitudinal acceleration that may arise from heating of the plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simulations are initiated in the force - free equilibrium state given by equation [ eqn : current - layer - ic ] , where the electric field is zero apart from a low amplitude ( @xmath53 ) white - noise perturbation introduced to break translational symmetry along the layers .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] contains renderings of two - dimensional slices of the toroidal ( in - page , top panel ) and poloidal ( out - of - page , middle panel ) magnetic field component .",
    "the left - most column shows the initial condition as described in equation [ eqn : current - layer - ic ] .",
    "the second column depicts the system when the linear instability first gives way to large - amplitude effects . by the third column ,",
    "an ensemble of plasmoids ( flux tubes oriented out of the page ) has emerged .",
    "an important feature of these structures is that they would be long - lived were translational symmetry along their axis to be imposed , as was shown in @xcite . without imposing that symmetry ,",
    "the flux tubes are unstable to kink and sausage modes",
    ". they also tend to coalescence with other flux tubes whose current flows in the same direction .",
    "this latter effect exemplifies the mechanism of non - helical inverse energy transfer studied in @xcite .",
    "subsequent columns portray the transition to fully developed turbulence .",
    "the whole sequence takes place over roughly 4 comoving light - travel times @xmath33 of a stripe , which is also the elapsed time experienced by plasma elements in transit from pulsar to termination shock when their lorentz factor is @xmath54 . in figure",
    "[ fig : tseries ] we plot the time series of volume - averaged magnetic and electric energy for different grid resolutions .",
    "relative consistency among different parameters indicates that the rate of energy dissipation by turbulence is insensitive to the current layer width and grid resolution , supporting the view that evolution in the non - linear regime is universal with respect to unresolved physics .",
    "transition to turbulence occurs when plasmoids grow to the scale of the stripe separation @xmath52 .",
    "our results from section [ sec : simulations ] indicate this occurs ( fourth column of figure [ fig : images ] ) after a comoving fast magnetosonic time @xmath55 , that is when causal contact between stripes is first established . for a wind that moves with constant velocity @xmath56 , this occurs at the radius in equation [ eqn : r - parallel ] reflects the distance at which two fast magnetosonic waves first meet , one propagating downstream starting at @xmath57 , and another in the upstream direction from @xmath58 . ] @xmath59 as shown in figure [ fig : tseries ] , about half the magnetic energy has been dissipated by the time plasmoids reach the stripe scale , so prior evolution occurs in the regime where @xmath60 is only somewhat smaller than @xmath61 and the flow is super - fast magnetosonic , @xmath62 ( lorentz factors corresponding to @xmath60 and @xmath56 ) . in that limit , equation [ eqn : r - parallel ] gives us @xmath63 . during this phase ,",
    "the flow is likely to accelerate outward due to loss of inward tension provided by the toroidal magnetic field , and also by establishing a turbulent pressure gradient .",
    "a detailed analysis along the lines of @xcite , together with a turbulence closure of the mhd equations would thus be necessary to determine the acceleration profile . here",
    ", we adopt the conservative approximation that @xmath56 appearing in equation [ eqn : r - parallel ] corresponds to the terminal wind lorentz factor .",
    "transition to turbulence would thus be avoided by causality if @xmath64 were to be @xmath65 .",
    "faster winds would reach the deceleration point before a signal travels between adjacent current layers , so corrugations could not grow large enough to effect mixing between them . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we will constrain @xmath64 empirically within our interpretation of the crab flares .",
    "the third column of figure [ fig : images ] shows our prediction for the stripe morphology when the wind passes through @xmath66 , that is after a comoving fast magnetosonic time has elapsed since the onset of non - linear evolution . beyond a few times @xmath66 , the wind evolves as freely decaying turbulence of magnetized relativistic plasma",
    "the fully developed turbulent cascade could in principle be slowed by transverse expansion of the flow , so we need to repeat the exercise of section [ sec : linear - instabilities ] , now comparing the eddy turn - over frequency @xmath67 with the expansion rate @xmath68 . here , we have invoked that turbulent motions decay alongside the alfvn speed @xmath69 @xcite . as seen in the plasma rest frame ( figure [ fig : images ] ) ,",
    "eddies are initially isotropic and roughly the size of the comoving stripe separation @xmath52 .",
    "they are thus seen in the pulsar frame to be stretched by a factor @xmath64 in the transverse direction .",
    "since we wish to compare transverse stretching rate with the eddy frequency , we assign eddies the transverse scale , @xmath70 . keeping in mind that turbulent cells increase in size @xmath71 due to the expansion , as well as by inverse energy transfer @xcite",
    ", the eddy size is parameterized by @xmath72 where @xmath73 determines the rate at which turbulence increases its coherence scale due to inverse energy transfer alone .",
    "the ratio of eddy turnover to expansion is thus @xmath74 where we have related @xmath3 to the alfvn speed and assumed that @xmath60 and @xmath56 are both effectively @xmath61 out to @xmath66 .",
    "thus , at least out to a few @xmath66 , expansion can be safely neglected , and our simulation results ( which do not account for that expansion ) remain applicable .    what if turbulence evolves to increase its coherency at the fastest rate allowed by causality ?",
    "suppose that two fluid elements on radial trajectories with lorentz factor @xmath64 are initially at radius @xmath75 and separated by an angle @xmath76 .",
    "a pulse of light emitted by one is first received by the other when they have moved to a radius @xmath77 , provided where @xmath78 . ]",
    "@xmath79 . by assuming that turbulence commences at @xmath80 and setting @xmath81",
    ", we determine the maximum angular coherence scale at the termination shock to be @xmath82",
    "here we develop a simplistic model for the crab nebula s observed @xmath0-ray variability @xcite .",
    "we adopt a tentative interpretation of the april 2011 event in which the rise time @xmath83{hr}$ ] coincides with the emergence of a giant coherent structure ( or `` blob '' ) from the upstream wind into the post - shock flow , while the decline @xmath84{days}$ ] is associated with the cooling time of the blob s highest energy particles .",
    "we assume the shock s kinetic structure to be mediated by energy - bearing particles having lorentz factor @xmath64 , while those of highest energy @xmath85 are only weakly deflected through an angle @xmath86 before cooling in the post - shock magnetic field @xmath87 .",
    "the angular scale @xmath88 from which photons are received is the larger of @xmath89 and @xmath86 , and is reliably the latter .",
    "we assume that only a small patch of the blob surface is visible , @xmath90 , so that the flare s inferred isotropic luminosity is independent of @xmath88 .",
    "a further assumption is that turbulence develops similar longitudinal and transverse coherency in the pulsar rest frame .",
    "though harder to justify ( eddies typically emerge from the wind pancaked by lorentz contraction ) , this condition only needs to be fulfilled intermittently both in time and solid angle . by setting @xmath91 ( equation [ eqn : causality - scale ] ) , and @xmath92{cm}$ ] where @xmath93{cm}$ ]",

    "we then evolve @xmath107 by synchrotron cooling in the post - shock magnetic field to determine the spectrum at later times .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows @xmath104 fitted to the peak of the april 2011 flare , using fermi - lat data around mjd 55667 @xcite , while figure [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the fermi - lat photon flux light curve above 100 mev together with post - shock cooling of @xmath108 .",
    "the best - fit magnetic field value @xmath109{\\mu g}$ ] is somewhat higher than the mean nebular field of @xmath110{\\mu g}$ ] @xcite , but that is not unexpected in such close proximity to the shock .",

    "thus downstream trajectories must be in the bohm limit to satisfy our assumption that @xmath126 .",

    "we have argued that the crab nebula s @xmath0-ray variability can be induced by turbulent intermittency of the pulsar wind .",
    "our analysis predicts that linear instability of the current layers gives way to turbulence well upstream of the wind termination shock , provided the bulk lorentz factor is @xmath2 .",
    "we went on to estimate the largest spatial coherency attainable by freely decaying turbulence in the radially expanding flow , and found that the @xmath130{hr}$ ] rise time of the april 2011 event can be accounted for if @xmath131 .",
    "we then fit a simplistic model to the fermi - lat spectrum of the flare , and determined roughly 1/10 of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity must be channeled into non - thermal particles to explain it .",
    "our numerical treatment here was limited to a local comoving patch of wind plasma .",
    "a more realistic analysis will need to account for expansion in the radial background flow , which could modify the nature of linear instabilities .",
    "we have also ignored all kinetic processes , which may complicate arguments given in section [ sec : linear - instabilities ] that linear instabilities act quickly .",
    "still , we note that kinetic particle - in - cell simulations @xcite also point to large - scale disruption of striped magnetic fields not unlike the behavior in force - free electrodynamics simulations seen here .",
    "we have also approximated the pulsar wind as having constant lorentz factor as a function of radius , even though one dimensional mhd solutions involve acceleration due to both ideal ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and dissipative ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) processes . such acceleration",
    "would follow the turbulence transition ( due to loss of the inward tension force provided by the toroidal field ) , leading to suppression of causal contact and thus limiting the growth of coherent structures , which are crucial to our interpretation of the crab nebula flares . however , we have also ignored the prospect that current layers disrupt at close distance to the pulsar , when the lorentz factor is still @xmath132 .",
    "that would allow turbulence more time over which to develop spatial coherency .",
    "our analysis of the tearing instability in section [ sec : linear - instabilities ] implies that appearance of plasmoids in the vicinity of the light cylinder is certainly possible .",
    "actually , such behavior is an essential feature of the pulsed gev emission scenario for the crab pulsar sketched in @xcite .",
    "large - amplitude kinking of the current layer near the light cylinder in axially symmetric aligned rotator solutions has also been reported by @xcite .",
    "such early disruption would imply rapid acceleration very close to the wind s base .",
    "interestingly , abrupt acceleration of the wind at around @xmath133 has been inferred from the crab s pulsed emission in the very high energy @xmath0-rays by @xcite .",
    "very little radiation will be produced in the wind zone , even if it becomes turbulent .",
    "the reason is seen to be that comoving synchrotron power @xmath134 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath135 , while the travel duration is shortened by another factor of @xmath64 . specifically , a single particle traveling from radius @xmath75 to the termination shock with lorentz factor @xmath0 will radiate a fraction @xmath136 of its kinetic energy given by @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the classical electron radius , and the magnetic field @xmath140 is the upper limit corresponding to no dissipation . assuming that @xmath141{g}$ ] and that radiation begins around the turbulence transition @xmath142",
    ", we find that @xmath143      our model for crab flares has several features in common with the ideas of other authors .",
    "for example , the `` magnetic untwisting '' scenario of @xcite also envisions energy release to originate around @xmath144{cm}$ ] , well within the wind zone .",
    "while our analysis indicates that significant dissipation of magnetic energy is possible there , poor radiative efficiency implies that any flaring emission could not be produced _ in situ_. @xcite have also developed a model in which flares occur when blobs emerge from the wind zone , and examined the possibility that radiation occurs in the jitter regime .",
    "our analysis provides a physical basis for the production of such blobs , but we find the condition for jitter radiation , namely that post - shock magnetic coherency peaks at @xmath145{cm}$ ] ( section [ sec : model ] ) , to be quite strict , as the relaxation time for such small - scale turbulence is extremely short . @xcite proposed the flares correspond to rarest excursions in magnetic field intensity of plasma moving through the termination shock , which elicit radiative enhancements from an otherwise stationary electron population .",
    "that scenario also looks favorable if the pulsar wind contains turbulence .",
    "more conclusive evidence regarding possible tev counterparts may help determine whether radiative intermittency originates in the particle distribution or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "future analysis aiming to measure the spatial statistics of magnetic versus non - thermal energy density in decaying plasma turbulence could also be fruitful .",
    "another avenue that looks encouraging if the inner wind contains turbulence is one in which flares occur when the termination shock normal moves through the line of sight due to its own intrinsic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "such a scenario may treat values of @xmath146 and @xmath96 we inferred in section [ sec : model ] as reflecting _ continuous _ wind parameters , and that intermittency is introduced by fluctuations in the angle of the post - shock flow .",
    "we opted to explore the `` blob '' model for this work because of the appearance that crab flare light curves are not time - symmetric , it because it allowed us to exploit the connection between the wind lorentz factor and turbulence coherence scale discussed in section [ sec : causality ] .",
    "if further data indicates equal rise and decline times , or if the rather low lorentz factor implied by our model can be independently ruled out , then the fluctuating termination shock approach seems to be a good choice .",
    "at least , it benefits from high efficiency of particle acceleration expected if turbulence operates throughout the far upstream flow .",
    "flares have also been suggested to occur by spontaneous magnetic reconnection events occurring somewhere in the nebula @xcite .",
    "while relativistic magnetic reconnection is now understood to energize non - thermal particles with high efficiency , the april 2011 event requires _ all _ the magnetic energy ( if released isotropically ) in a region @xmath147{cm}$ ] with @xmath148{mg}$ ] intensity to be promptly converted into _ fast - cooling _ electrons .",
    "thus , special reconnection geometries ( `` mini - jets '' ) in which the particle exhaust is confined to a very narrow opening angle must be invoked .",
    "@xcite proposed a model involving quasi - cyclic instabilities near the base of the polar jet , which seems to be supported by full - scale simulations of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "however , if the flares occur by discharge of accumulated magnetic energy , their power could sometimes exceed that of the pulsar , which has not been seen yet ( meanwhile , our model would be ruled out by such observations ) .",
    "arguments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in favor of `` accumulation - discharge '' models appeal to the extreme stability of the pulsar as the nebula s power supply .",
    "be that as it may , wind plasma is an unsteady transmission line for delivery of the pulsar s ac power to the nebula .",
