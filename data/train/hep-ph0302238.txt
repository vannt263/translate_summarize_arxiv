    "<S> + for relativistic heavy ion collisions this cross section is huge and the problem of coulomb corrections ( higher order photon exchanges between the produced lepton pair and the coulomb fields of colliding ions ) becomes relevant . </S>",
    "<S> + the coulomb corrections ( cc ) in the case of lepton pair photoproduction off the nucleus coulomb field was obtained in  @xcite.it was shown that the total cross section for the process of lepton pair photoproduction in the coulomb field of the nucleus with charge number z reads = [ - -f(z)],f(x)=x^2_n=1^. the production of lepton pairs from the nuclear coulomb field by virtual photons was investigated in  @xcite . in  @xcite the bethe- maximon result </S>",

    "<S> + as to higher order photon exchanges in the process ( 1 ) , despite the intensive work done on this issue in the last years  @xcite the problem of allowing for cc in all orders of perturbation theory is not solved up to now.the goal of the present work is to investigate this issue based on our recent results  @xcite obtained for the first terms of perturbation theory for the amplitude of the process ( 1 ) . + as was shown in  @xcite , the number of remarkable cancellations between the different terms in the cross section of the process ( 1 ) takes place , which allows one to simplify the obtained expressions and may be a hint of how to solve the problem in the general case . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the results of  @xcite to all orders of perturbation theory and using the impact factor representation get compact analytical expressions for the cross section of the process ( 1 ) true to all orders of perturbation theory ( up to the constant terms ) . </S>",
    "<S> + it is convenient to separate the full amplitude of the process ( 1 ) into different terms which lead to a distinct energy dependence in the cross section , namely @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the born amplitude ( see fig.1 ) ; the terms @xmath7 correspond to the pair production by single photon exchange between the ion with charge number @xmath8 and the produced pair and any multiple photon exchanges between the pair of leptons and the ion with @xmath9 ( fig.2 ) ; the term @xmath10 in ( 4 ) describes the cases when the pair interacts with each ion more than once ( fig.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + we do not consider the set of feynman diagrams ( fd ) accounting for the coulomb interactions between the colliding nuclei.such interactions were analyzed in  @xcite , where it has been shown that interaction between ions completely canceled when the final ions are not detected . </S>",
    "<S> + the square of the amplitude ( 4 ) is the combination of different terms which can be classified in the cross section by their energy dependence , i.e. by different powers of big logarithm @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the born approximation leads to the third power of l in the total cross section ( see ( 2 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> as was discussed in  @xcite , the next powers of l come from the square of @xmath12 and @xmath13 and their interference with the born amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> + as to the interference @xmath14 , it is compensated ( up to the constant ) by the interference between the born term and relevant one @xmath15 , i.e. the combinations of the type @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the same cancellations take place also in the @xmath17 and any interference of the type @xmath18.each such combination leads in the cross section to the terms growing with energy as the first power of l.to find their contribution to the cross section one must take the imaginary part of the complex logarithm @xmath19 which is energy independent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if one confines to the terms in the cross section rising with energy , the square of the relevant matrix element can be cast in the following form : m ^2=m_b^2+m_s^2 + m^s^2 + 2re(m_b^*m_s+m_b^*m^s ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus to calculate the cross section of the process ( 1 ) ( up to the constant terms ) one needs the knowledge of the born amplitude @xmath6 and terms relevant to single photon exchange with one of the colliding nuclei and any exchanges with the other @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> a similar consideration can be easily carried out for the pairs moving in the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> + expression ( 6 ) depends on lepton transverse momenta @xmath32 through @xmath33 unlike the amplitude for the process of pair photoproduction off the coulomb field.this is a consequence of that in our approach we project all momenta with respect to the axis of colliding ions in their centre of mass system.as to the case of photoproduction , the natural choice is the direction of incident photon . </S>",
    "<S> finally , as was shown in @xcite the racah formula ( 2 ) can be reproduced starting with the above expressions . </S>",
    "<S> + the spin structure ( 6 ) is the same in all orders of perturbation theory for the matrix elements relevant to single photon exchange with one of the ions ( with any number of exchanges with another ion).this is a direct consequence of lepton helicity conservation at high energy  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the expression ( 24 ) becomes invalid in the case of pair production by the very soft photons ( @xmath53 in the rest system of one of the ion ) which corresponds to the lower limit of @xmath52 ( we are working in the center of mass system of colliding ions . ) at such low energies one has to take into account the threshold effects and deviation from the eikonal approach  @xcite which is out of the present work scope . </S>",

    "<S> as to the formula ( 17 ) in  @xcite by derivation it is relevant to the part of the cross section provided by two or more exchanges from both nuclei ( @xmath10 with the preceding notation).as was discussed above and in  @xcite such exchanges contribute only to the constant part of the total cross section and are outside of our consideration.there is correspondence between ( 26 ) and relevant formula ( 30 ) in  @xcite obtained for the total cross section of @xmath57 pair production in the coulomb field of the nucleus by high energy muons using the generalized weizsacker - williams approximation . </S>",
    "<S> + in deducing ( 26 ) we integrate over @xmath52 from its lower limit , which is strictly speaking incorrect by the reasons mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the error in such approach can not be crucial and expression ( 26 ) can be safely used for the simple estimates of the coulomb corrections to the total cross section of the process under consideration.the reason is relative smallness of the near threshold contribution of the pair photoproduction in the coulomb field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the obtained in the present work expressions can be used for calculation of completely ( four particles in the final state ) or partly ( see ( 24 ) ) differential cross sections the issue which is necessary in any experiment . </S>"
