    "in the study of slow relaxation phenomena  @xcite , typically , a temperature quench is made at time @xmath5 and the quantities of interest , such as the autocorrelation @xmath6 and the linear response function @xmath7 , are monitored at subsequent times @xmath8 .",
    "the peculiar and interesting feature of these processes is that equilibrium is never reached , namely there does not exist a finite time scale @xmath9 such that for @xmath10 two time quantites become time translation invariant .",
    "a substantial progress in the study of these phenomena has been achieved after cugliandolo and kurchan  @xcite have introduced the modification of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) as a quantitative indicator of the deviation from equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "this can be formulated in several equivalent ways . here",
    ", we find convenient to use the effective temperature  @xcite t_eff(t , t_w)= _ t_w c(t , t_w ) r(t , t_w ) [ 0.1bis ] which coincides with the temperature @xmath11 of the thermal bath if the fdt holds , that is in equilibrium , while it is different from @xmath11 off equilibrium . because of the absence of a finite equilibration time ,",
    "the characterization of the system staying out of equilibrium for an arbitrarily long time is contained in @xmath12 .",
    "however , since @xmath13 implies also @xmath14 , to make the limit operation meaningful one must specify how the two times are pushed to infinity .",
    "one way of doing this is to fix the value of the autocorrelation function @xmath6 as @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath6 for a given @xmath15 is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath16 , the time @xmath16 can be reparametrized in terms of @xmath17 obtaining @xmath18 and , keeping @xmath17 fixed , the limit ( c ) = _ t_w _ eff(c , t_w ) [ 2.15bis ] defines the effective temperature in the time sector corresponding to the chosen value of @xmath17 .",
    "this quantity is important because , when appropriate conditions are satisfied , provides the connection between dynamic and static properties  @xcite through the relation p(q ) = t d dc",
    "t(c)^-1|_c = q [ fmpp ] where @xmath19 is the overlap probability function of the equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , different shapes of @xmath20 are associated to different degrees of complexity of the equilibrium state .",
    "a first broad classification of systems has been made  @xcite drawing the distinction between coarsening systems , structural glasses and the infinite range spin glass model on the basis of the patterns displayed by @xmath20 , or related quantities such as the fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( fdr ) and the zero field cooled ( zfc ) susceptibility . in this paper",
    "we focus on coarsening systems , exemplified by a non disordered and non frustrated system such as a ferromagnet , relaxing via domain growth after a quench to or below the critical point  @xcite .",
    "we show that even within the framework of these so called trivial systems , the spectrum of the behaviors of @xmath20 is quite rich and interesting .    in order to illustrate the problem , in fig.1 we have drawn schematically the phase diagram , in the temperature - dimensionality plane .",
    "the critical temperature vanishes at the lower critical dimensionality @xmath3 .",
    "the disordered and ordered phase are , respectively , above and below the critical line @xmath21 .",
    "slow relaxation arises for quenches with the final temperature everywhere in the shaded area , including the boundary .",
    "usually , one considers some fixed @xmath22 ( dashed line in fig.1 ) and studies the quench to a final temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the form of @xmath20 in the critical quench with @xmath24 ( fig.2a ) is different from that with @xmath25 ( fig.2b ) and both are independent of @xmath26 . the interesting question , then , is what happens at the special point @xmath27 , where critical and subcritical quenches merge .",
    "namely , will @xmath20 display continuity with the critical or with the subcritical shape ? on the basis of the available evidence from analytical solutions  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite , the surprising answer is with neither of them .",
    "third _ and nontrivial form of @xmath20 is found ( fig.2c ) in the quench to @xmath27 .    in this paper",
    "we present the scaling framework which allows to account in a unified way for this wealth of behaviors displayed by @xmath20 upon letting @xmath11 and @xmath26 to vary .",
    "this , in turn , allows to gain insight on the challanging problem  @xcite of the scaling of @xmath7 in the quenches below @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of these ideas , predictions can be made for the interesting case of the xy model .",
    "in that case , the phase diagram of fig.1 is enriched by the presence of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) line of critical points at the lower critical dimensionality @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , slow relaxation in the xy model arises also by arranging the quenches onto the kt line .",
    "since this is a critical line , the phenomenology for @xmath30 is expected to be akin to the one along the @xmath21 line , while at @xmath31 the switch to the third nontrivial form of @xmath20 is expected to take place .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "the scaling properties of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are reviewed . in section  [ sec3 ] the general scaling behavior of @xmath32",
    "is derived , and in section  [ sec4 ] the parametric form @xmath20 is obtained .",
    "the problem of the exponent @xmath4 of @xmath7 below @xmath0 is presented in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "sections  [ sec6 ] and  [ sec7 ] are devoted to the illustration of the general concepts in the context of the large-@xmath33 model and of the @xmath34 model , respectively .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "in the following we consider quenches from an initial disordered state above the critical line to any one of the states in the shaded area of fig.1 . for definiteness , we shall refer to purely relaxational dynamics without conservation of the order parameter , but the results are of general validity .",
    "the common feature of all these processes is that , after a short transient , dynamical scaling sets in with a characteristic length growing with the power law @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the scaling properties with @xmath24 are different from those with @xmath25  @xcite . in the renormalization group language",
    "this means that for a given @xmath26 there are two fixed points , one unstable at @xmath0 and the other stable and attractive at @xmath31 ( thermal fluctuations are irrelevant below @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath36 on the @xmath21 line coincides with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath37 and depends on dimensionality , while below criticality it takes the dimensionality independent value @xmath38 .",
    "these values become identical at @xmath27 , since @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "let us , next , review the scaling properties of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the fixed point structure enters in two ways : in the values of the exponents involved and , less obviously , in the very same form of the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in analysing the asymptotic behavior of these quantities ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between the _ short time _ and the _ large time _",
    "behaviors obtained by letting the waiting time @xmath15 to become large , while keeping , respectively , either the time difference @xmath40 or the time ratio @xmath41 fixed .",
    "notice that from @xmath42 follows that the short time regime , when using the @xmath43 variable , gets compressed into @xmath44 .",
    "an important general property of two time quantities in slow relaxation phenomena is that in the short time regime the system appears equilibrated and the fdt is satisfied , while the off equilibrium character of the dynamics , or aging , shows up in the large time regime  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism underlying this property , however , is quite different for quenches to and below @xmath0 .      in the critical quenches , for @xmath15 sufficiently large , @xmath45 and @xmath46 take the product forms  @xcite c(t , t_w , t_0 ) = ( + t_0)^-bg_c(x , y ) [ scr1 ] r(t , t_w , t_0 ) = ( + t_0)^-(1+a)g_r(x , y ) [ scr2 ] where @xmath47 are smooth functions of @xmath43 with a weak dependence on @xmath48 .",
    "in addition to the observation times , @xmath16 and @xmath15 , we have explicitely included also the dependence on a microscopic time @xmath49 , which is needed to regularize these functions at equal times . in particular , we shall take @xmath50 throughout . in the short time regime c(t ,",
    "t_w , t_0 ) = ( + t_0)^-bg_c(1,0 ) [ scr5 ] r(t , t_w , t_0 ) = ( + t_0)^-(1+a)g_r(1,0 ) [ scr6 ] which are the autocorrelation and response function of the stationary critical dynamics satisfying , therefore , the equilibrium fdt , i.e. @xmath51 , which implies t_c g_r(1,0)= b g_c(1,0 ) [ s6 ] and a = b . [ s60 ]",
    "we emphasize that , in the critical quench , as a consequence of the multiplicative structure and of the fdt , the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath52 are not independent and coincide .",
    "furthermore , their common value is given by  @xcite a = b=(d-2+)/z_c = 2/z_c [ 207 ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the usual static exponents .",
    "using the geometrical interpretation of the critical properties eq .",

    "( [ 207 ] ) is replaced by @xmath60 with @xmath61 vanishing as @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "( [ scr1 ] ) and  ( [ scr2 ] ) can be recast in the simple aging form c(t , t_w , t_0 ) = t_w^-bf_c(x , y ) [ scr7 ] r(t , t_w , t_0 ) = t_w^-(1+a)f_r(x ,",

    "these functions , for large @xmath43 and @xmath15 , decay with the same power law f_c , r(x,0 ) = a_c , r x^-_c / z_c [ scr10 ] where @xmath63 is the autocorrelation exponent  @xcite .",
    "below @xmath0 , the picture is different because the stationary and aging components enter _ additively _ into the autocorrelation function  @xcite c(t , t_w , t_0 ) = c_st()+ c_ag(t , t_w , t_0 ) [ 4.01 ] where @xmath64 is the equilibrium autocorrelation function in the broken symmetry pure state at the temperature @xmath11 . from the equal time properties",
    "c(t , t , t_0)=1 c_st(=0)=1-m^2 [ 4.01bis ] which imply c_ag(t , t , t_0)=m^2 [ 4.01quater ] where @xmath65 is the spontaneous magnetization , follows that in eq .",
    "( [ 4.01 ] ) the stationary component corresponds to the quasi - equilibrium decay _ to _ the plateau at the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath66 , while the aging component @xmath67 describes the off - equilibrium decay _ from _ the plateau at much larger times . in the short time regime , then , we have c(+t_w , t_w , t_0 ) = c_st ( ) + m^2 [ scr15 ] while , taking into account that @xmath64 vanishes as @xmath68 , in the large time regime c(t , t_w , t_0 ) = c_ag(t , t_w , t_0 ) .",
    "[ scr16 ] from this it is easy to verify that , contrary to what happens with the multiplicative structure of eq .",
    "( [ scr1 ] ) , the limits @xmath13 and @xmath14 do not commute _ t _",
    "c(t , t_w , t_0 ) = m^2 [ scr17 ] _ t_w _",
    "t c(t , t_w , t_0 ) = 0 [ scr18 ] yielding the weak ergodicity breaking  @xcite , characteristic of the quenches below @xmath0 .",
    "the additive structure of the response function r(t , t_w , t_0 ) = r_st()+ r_ag(t , t_w , t_0 ) [ 4.02 ] is obtained in the following way  @xcite : in the short time regime stationarity holds @xmath69 and @xmath70 is defined from the fdt r_st ( ) = - 1 t c_st ( ) [ stfdt ] whilst @xmath71 remains defined by eq .",
    "( [ 4.02 ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath71 vanishes in the short time regime and since , conversely , @xmath70 vanishes in the large time regime , we may write @xmath72 the components @xmath73 and @xmath71 obey simple aging forms like  ( [ scr7 ] ) and  ( [ scr8 ] ) with scaling functions @xmath74 decaying , for large @xmath43 , with a power law of the form  ( [ scr10 ] ) . it is understood that all the exponents must be replaced by their values below @xmath0 , which are different from those at @xmath0 . in particular , from phase ordering theory it is well known  @xcite that @xmath75 independently from dimensionality .",
    "this can be readily understood from @xmath76 , which holds in general , and from the compact nature of the coarsening domains , which gives @xmath77 .",
    "quite different is the case of the exponent @xmath4 . since the fdt relates only the stationary components @xmath64 and @xmath70 , due to the additive structure of eqs .",
    "( [ 4.01 ] ) and  ( [ 4.02 ] ) we have no more the constraint @xmath78 , as in the critical quench .",
    "namely , in the quench below @xmath0 the value of @xmath4 is decoupled from that of @xmath52 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the determination of @xmath4 below @xmath0 is a difficult and challanging problem  @xcite , which will be discussed in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "as we have seen above , the structures of @xmath45 and @xmath46 follow different patterns in the quenches to and below @xmath0 .",
    "this raises the question of which one applies when the quench is made at @xmath27 . in other words , should we consider the state @xmath27 as a critical point with @xmath2 , as it is often done in the literature , or should we consider it as the continuation to @xmath3 of the @xmath31 states below criticality ?",
    "the correct answer is the second one , since at @xmath3 the system orders , as in all the states below the critical line , while on the @xmath21 line there is no ordering . in particular",
    ", this implies that weak ergodicity breaking takes place also in the quench to @xmath27 . from eqs .",

    "the fact that the quench to @xmath27 belongs to the additive scheme becomes important when considering the response function , because if @xmath64 vanishes in the ground state , the same is not true for @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ 4.02 ] ) holds with @xmath82 and it is important to subtract this contribution from @xmath46 if one wants to study the scaling properties of @xmath71 . we shall come back on this point in section  [ sec6 ] , when treating the explicit example of the large-@xmath33 model .",
    "it should be mentioned , here , that the linear response function at @xmath31 is well defined only for systems with soft spins . in the case of hard spins there",
    "does not exist a linear response regime when @xmath31 . for a discussion of this problem and how to bypass it in ising systems",
    ", we refer to  @xcite .",
    "a natural question is how the picture outlined above compares with theoretical approaches . in the case of the quench to @xmath0 renormalization group methods",
    "are available  @xcite , which account for the multiplicative structure of the autocorrelation and response function and give explicit expressions for the quantities of interst up to two loops order .",
    "the development of systematic expansion methods for the quench below @xmath0 is much more difficult  @xcite .",
    "recently , henkel and collaborators  @xcite have developed a method based on the requirement of local scale invariance .",
    "according to this approach the response function obeys the multiplicative structure  ( [ scr2 ] ) _ both _ in the quenches to @xmath0 and below @xmath0 .",
    "problems , then , arise in the latter case .",
    "the main one is of conceptual nature , since , as explained above , the weak ergodicity breaking scenario requires the autocorrelation function to obey the additive structure  ( [ 4.01 ] ) .",
    "then , in the short time regime , where eq .",
    "( [ scr15 ] ) holds , from the fdt one has @xmath83 , which implies @xmath84 . in other words , if the local scale invariance prediction for the response function is valid then the stationary correlation function must decay with a power law .",
    "this is the case , as we have seen above , in the critical quenches and , as we shall see in section  [ sec6 ] , in the large @xmath33 model .",
    "conversely , in all other cases where the equilibrium correlation function below @xmath0 decays exponentially , the response function can not be of the form  ( [ scr2 ] ) . nonetheless , henkel et al .",
    "do criticize  @xcite the additive structure below @xmath0 .",
    "the second problem is that existing results , exact  @xcite and approximated  @xcite as well as numerical  @xcite , lead to an the aging part of the response function which , for systems with scalar order parameter  @xcite , is of the form r_ag(t , t_w , t_0 ) = t_w^-1/z(+ t_0)^-(a-1/z+1)g_r(x , y ) .",
