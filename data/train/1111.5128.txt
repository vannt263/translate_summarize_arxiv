    "( ii ) the self - contact and cavity contact models also need to be extended by a dry friction model to capture the effects of static and dynamic friction .",
    "intrinsic curvature as a third crucial wire characteristic , on the other hand , is trivial to incorporate into the presented finite elements by setting non - zero local intrinsic angular degrees of freedom in each corotated frame .",
    "together with the suppression of axial rotation at the cavity entrance , pre - curvature controls the amount of order in the wire morphology in packed three - dimensional cavities .",
