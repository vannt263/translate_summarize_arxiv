    "in 1971 , hawking suggested @xcite that there may be a very large number of gravitationally collapsed charged objects of very low masses , formed as a result of fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "a mass of @xmath10 kg of these objects could be accumulated at the centre of a star like the sun .",
    "hawking treats these objects classically and his arguments for doing so are as follows @xcite : gravitational collapse is a _ classical _ process and microscopic black holes can form when their schwarzschild radius is greater than the planck length @xmath11 m ( at planck lengths quantum gravitational effects do not permit purely classical treatment ) .",
    "this allows the existence of collapsed objects of masses from @xmath12 kg and above and charges up to @xmath13 electron units @xcite .",
    "additionally , a sufficient concentration of electromagnetic radiation causes a gravitational collapse  even though the schwarzschild radius of the formed black hole is smaller than the photon s compton wavelength which is infinite .",
    "therefore , when elementary particles collapse to form a black hole , it is not the _ rest _ compton wavelength @xmath14 that is to be considered  one should instead consider the _ modified _",
    "compton wavelength @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the typical energy of an ultra - relativistic particle that went to form the black hole @xcite .",
    "microscopic black holes with schwarzschild radius greater than the modified compton wavelength @xmath15 , can form classically and independently on competing quantum processes .",
    "+ hawking suggests that these charged collapsed objects may have velocities in the range 50  10 @xmath17000 km / s and would behave in many respects like ordinary atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "when these objects travel through matter , they induce ionization and excitation and would produce bubble chamber tracks similar to those of atomic nuclei with the same charge .",
    "the charged collapsed objects survive annihilation and , at low velocities ( less than few thousand km / s ) , they may form electronic or protonic atoms @xcite : the positively charged collapsed objects would capture electrons and thus mimic super - heavy isotopes of known chemical elements , while negatively charged collapsed objects would capture protons and disguise themselves as the missing zeroth entry in the mendeleev table .",
    "+ such ultra - heavy charged massive particles ( champs ) were also studied by de rujula , glashow and sarid @xcite and considered as dark matter candidates .",
    "+ dark electric matter objects ( daemons ) of masses just above @xmath12 kg and charges of around @xmath18 electron units have been studied in the ioffe institute and positive results in their detection have been reported @xcite  observations of scintillations in zns(ag ) which are excited by electrons and nucleons ejected as the relic elementary planckian daemon captures a nucleus of zn ( or s ) .",
    "+ the dama ( dark matter ) collaboration also report positive results @xcite in the detection of such particles using 100 kg of highly radiopure nai(tl ) detector .",
    "+ such heavy charged particles can serve as driving force for the expansion of the universe during the radiation - dominated epoch in a classical particle - scale model , which we recently proposed @xcite . along with this type of particles , within our model",
    ", magnetic monopoles can also play the same role for the expansion of the universe : it has been suggested @xcite that ultra - heavy magnetic monopoles were created so copiously in the early universe that they outweighed everything else in the universe by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "+ our _ particle - scale _ model gives the expected prediction for the behaviour of the scale factor of the radiation - dominated expanding universe , @xmath20 and can be considered as a complement to the _ large - scale _ friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) model ( see , for example , @xcite ) which describes the universe as isotropic and homogeneous , with very smoothly distributed energy - momentum sources modeled as a perfect fluid , applicable on scales much larger than galactic ones . +",
    "this recently proposed @xcite classical mechanism for the cosmic expansion models the universe as a two - component gas .",
    "one of the fractions is that of ultra - relativistic `` normal '' particles of typical mass @xmath21 and charge @xmath22 with equation of state of an ideal quantum gas of massless particles .",
    "the other component is `` unusual ''  these are the particles of ultra - high masses @xmath23 ( of around @xmath12 kg and above ) and charges @xmath24 ( of around @xmath18 electron charges and above )  exactly as those described earlier .",
    "+ for an elementary particle such as the electron , the charge - to - mass ratio is @xmath25 ( in geometrized units @xmath26 ) , while for the `` unusual '' particles , @xmath27 . in view of this , the general - relativistic treatment of elementary particles or charged collapsed objects of very low masses also necessitates consideration from reissner ",
    "nordstrm ( or kerr  newman ) viewpoint  for as long as their charge - to - mass ratio remains above unity .",
    "we also treat the `` unusual '' particles classically ( in line with hawking s arguments outlined earlier ) .",
    "that is , the `` unusual '' particles are modelled as reissner ",
    "nordstrm naked singularities and the expansion mechanism is based on their gravito - electric repulsion . instead of the schwarzschild radius , the _ characteristic length _ that is to be considered now and compared to the _ modified _ compton length @xcite , will be the radius of the van der waals - like impenetrable sphere that surrounds a naked singularity ( see @xcite for a very thorough analysis of the radial motion of test particles in a reissner ",
    "nordstrm field ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for temperatures below @xmath28 k , the radius of the impenetrable sphere of an `` unusual '' particle of mass @xmath12 kg and charge @xmath18 electron units is greater than the _ modified _ compton wavelength of the `` unusual '' particle itself .",

    "naked singularities are disliked  hence the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite  but not ruled out  there is no mathematical proof whatsoever of the cosmic censorship .",
    "at least one naked singularity is agreed to have existed  the big bang  the universe itself .",
    "of particular importance in the study of naked singularities are the work of choptuik @xcite , where numerical analysis of einstein  klein ",
    "gordon solutions shows the circumstances under which naked singularities are produced , and the work of christodoulo @xcite who proved that there exist choices of asymptotically flat initial data which evolve to solutions with a naked singularity .",
    "the possibility of observing naked singularities at the lhc has been studied in @xcite  for example , a proton - proton collision could result in a naked singularity and a set of particles with vanishing total charge or with one net positive charge  an event probably undistinguishable from ordinary particle production . in a cosmological setting , naked singularities have been well studied and classified  see , for example , @xcite .",
    "consider a `` normal '' particle of specific charge @xmath29 , and an `` unusual '' particle of charge @xmath24 such that @xmath30 .",
    "if the `` normal '' particle approaches the `` unusual '' particle from infinity , the field of the naked singularity is characterized by three regions @xcite : .6 cm     .6 cm    * _ impenetrable region _  between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "+ for an incoming test particle , the condition for reality of the kinetic energy leads to the existence of two turning radii @xcite with a _ forbidden _ region in - between . the upper ( outside ) radius , which we denote @xmath33 , can be thought of as a radius of an `` impenetrable '' sphere surrounding the naked singularity .",
    "it depends on the energy of the incoming particle ( or the temperature @xmath34 of the `` normal '' fraction of the universe ) : the higher the energy ( or the temperature ) , the deeper the incoming particle will penetrate into the gravitationally repulsive field of the naked singularity .",
    "* _ repulsive region _  between the turning radius @xmath33 and the critical radius @xmath35 .",
    "+ the critical radius @xmath36 is where the repulsion and attraction interchange ( we determine @xmath36 later in this section ) .",
    "as the temperature drops , the `` unusual '' particles `` grow '' ( incoming particles have lower and lower energies and turn back farther and farther from the naked singularity ) . when the temperature gets sufficiently low , the radius of the `` unusual '' particles @xmath33 grows to @xmath36 ( but not beyond @xmath36 , as the region @xmath37 is characterized by attraction and an incoming particle can not turn back while attracted ) .",
    "this means that incoming particles have such low energies that they turn back immediately after they encounter the gravitational repulsion .",
    "incoming particles of charge @xmath22 such that @xmath38 do not even experience attraction  we shall see that the repulsive region for such particles extends to infinity ( the gravitational attraction will not be sufficiently strong to overcome the electrical repulsion ) .",
    "* _ attractive region _  from the critical radius @xmath36 to infinity .",
    "again , there is no gravitationally attractive region for an incoming particle such that @xmath38 .    as shown in @xcite , when an incoming particle has sufficiently large charge which is also opposite in sign to that of the naked singularity : @xmath39 the particle will collide with the naked singularity . when the naked singularity `` captures '' such particle , its charge @xmath24 decreases and its mass @xmath23 increases . if sufficient number of incoming particles are captured , @xmath24 will eventually become equal to @xmath23 ",
    "the naked singularity will pick a horizon and turn into a black hole .",
    "this black hole will evaporate quickly afterwards .",
    "we will assume that our `` unusual '' particles have survived such annihilation .",
    "we will also assume that these super - heavy charged particles have survived annihilation through all other different competing mechanisms  for example , they could recombine into neutral particles or decay before or after that ( see ellis et al .",

    "@xcite on the constraints of the relic abundance of a dark matter candidate  a generic particle of mass in the range of @xmath40 tev , lifetime greater than @xmath41 years , decaying into neutrinos ) .",
    "+ an interesting general - relativistic effect ( with no classical analogue ) is related to the ability of naked singularities to capture probes of charge having the same sign .",
    "this is associated with the inner turning radius which we denote by @xmath42 . on figure 2 ,",
    "the curves representing the two turning radii , @xmath33 and @xmath42 , are given as functions of the specific charge @xmath29 of the probe for different temperatures .",
    "the forbidden region is between the two curves .",
    "as can be seen , the lower curve @xmath42 corresponds to a turning radius ( capturing ) of a radially outgoing probe with charge having the same sign as the centre .",
    "this has no classical analogue and we argue that it could serve as a possible mechanism for the formation of the `` unusual '' particles in the extremely dense very early universe .",
    "moreover , this can also allow the extension of the range of validity of our model to account for the inflation of the universe : if charge non - conservation of the naked singularities occurs ( naked singularities picking up charge ) , then accelerated expansion can be achieved : @xmath43 or @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .",
    ".6 cm     .6 cm    our expansion model assumes that initially , at extremely high energies and pressures of the very early universe , the `` normal '' particles are within the gravitationally repulsive regions of the `` unusual '' particles with radial coordinates just above the upper turning radius @xmath33 .",
    "the particles from the `` normal '' fraction `` roll down '' the gravitationally repulsive potentials of the `` unusual '' particles and in result the universe expands .",
    "the addition of a new class of particles ( the `` unusual '' ) in the picture of the universe does not challenge our current understanding of the physical laws governing the universe .",
    "the `` unusual '' particles interact purely classically with the `` normal '' component of the universe and this classical interaction results in the appearance of a repulsive force .",
    "our aim is to offer a possible explanation for the expansion of the universe while conforming with the well established theoretical models . as shown in @xcite , during the reissner ",

    "nordstr \" om expansion , the time - dependance of the scale factor is : @xmath48 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "such is the behaviour of the scale factor during the expansion of the universe throughout the radiation - dominated era , obtained by the standard cosmological treatment .",
    "+ on a large scale , the universe is isotropic and homogeneous and for a flrw universe ( @xcite ) , the energy - momentum sources are modeled as a perfect fluid , specified by an energy density and isotropic pressure in its rest frame .",
    "this applies for matter known observationally to be very smoothly distributed . on smaller scales , such as stars or even galaxies ,",
    "this is a poor description . in our picture , the universe has global flrw geometry , but locally it has reissner  nordstr \" om geometry .",
    "the compatibility of local reissner ",
    "nordstr \" om geometry with global flrw geometry has been well established : in 1933 , mcvittie @xcite proposed a metric embedding a schwarzschild solution @xcite in a flrw universe . in 1993 ,",
    "kastor and traschen ( kt ) @xcite found a solution desribing a system of an arbitrary number of charged black holes in the background of a de sitter universe @xcite .",
    "the case of vanishing cosmological constant in the kt solution corresponds to the static majumdar ",
    "papapetrou ( mp ) solution @xcite , while the solution with positive cosmological constant is highly dynamical and describes black holes exchanging radiation with the background until becoming extreme ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "a spinning version of the mp solution with naked singularities was found in @xcite and @xcite . in 1999 ,",
    "the kt solution was extended @xcite to multi - kerr - newman - de sitter black holes .",
    "metric for reissner ",
    "nordstrm black holes in an expanding / contracting flrw universe was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the interplay between cosmological expansion and local attraction in a gravitationally bound system is studied in @xcite where new exact solutions are presented which describe black holes perfectly comoving with a generic flrw universe .",
    "+ returning to the local reissner  nordstr \" om geometry , on the level of the interaction between the `` unusual '' particles and the `` normal '' particles of the universe , the density and pressure variables should be different from those used in the large - scale geometry .",
    "we are going to complement the entire radiation - dominated era with reissner ",
    "nordstrm expansion and model the interaction between the `` unusual '' particles and the `` normal '' particles as interaction between the components of a van der waals gas .",
    "modeling the universe as a van der waals phase is possible in the light of the deep analogies between the physical picture behind the reissner ",
    "nordstr \" om expansion and the classical van der waals molecular model : atoms are surrounded by imaginary hard spheres and the molecular interaction is strongly repulsive in close proximity , mildly attractive at intermediate range , and negligible at longer distances . the laws of ideal gas must then be corrected to accommodate for such interaction : the pressure should increase due to the additional repulsion and the available volume should decrease as atoms are no longer entities with zero own volumes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "+ as an interesting development in a similar vein , one should point out the work @xcite ( see also the references therein ) which studies van der waals quintessence by considering a cosmological model comprising of two fluids : baryons , modelled as dust ( large - scale structure fluid ) and dark matter with a van der waals equation of state ( background fluid ) .",

    "due to its ultra - high energy , the `` normal '' particle will overcome the gravitational attraction and will escape unopposed to infinity . thus the gravitationally attractive region is of no importance for such particles and for them we can assume that the potential of the naked singularity is infinity from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and zero from @xmath52 to infinity .",
    "+ for `` normal '' particles such that @xmath56 , the potential gradually drops to zero towards infinity ( there is no attraction for these probes ) .",

    "the turning radii are given by @xcite : [ r0 ] r_= .",
    "we identify the impenetrable radius @xmath33 of an `` unusual '' particle as the bigger root @xmath78 and the inner turning radius @xmath42 as the smaller root @xmath79 .",
    "the expansion mechanism is based on the fact that @xmath33 is inversely proportional to the temperature , namely , the naked singularity drives apart all neutral particles and particles of specific charge @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "+ note that when @xmath80 ( which happens when the rest energy becomes the dominant term , i.e. when @xmath58 drops below @xmath21 , or below @xmath81k ) , then the turning radius @xmath33 tends to infinity .",
    "+ at the point where gravitational attraction and repulsion interchange , there will be no force acting on the incoming particle .",
    "that is , this is the point where the derivative of the potential ( [ pot ] ) vanishes : [ rc ] r_c = m ( - 1 ) ( 1 - ) ^-1 .",
    "obviously , the critical radius @xmath36 for an incoming particle charged oppositely to the `` unusual '' particle ( @xmath82 ) will be smaller than the critical radius for a neutral ( @xmath63 ) incoming particle ( neutral particles suffer repulsion ) as the region of gravitational repulsion will be reduced by the additional electrical attraction .",
    "when the incoming probe has charge with the same sign as that of the `` unusual '' particle and @xmath83 , then @xmath36 does not exist .",
    "this means that there will be a region of repulsion only  the gravitational attraction will not be sufficiently strong to overcome the electrical repulsion .",

    "where : r = \\ {    ll r_c , & r_c , &    .",
