    "two of the key issues facing qcd at low energy are a quantitative description of confinement and an understanding of the origins of the constituent quark model . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how both issues may be resolved through a nonperturbative analysis of qcd in coulomb gauge .",
    "this demonstration makes the physical origin of both effects clear , resolves several longstanding inconsistencies in the constituent quark model , significantly extends the quark model , and establishes a  perhaps surprising  relationship between confinement and the constituent quark model .",
    "although lattice gauge computations are capable of answering many questions in strong qcd , it is clear that the development of reliable analytical continuum tools are a necessity for advancing the field@xcite .",
    "continuum methods allow one to understand how qcd works from first principles , permit the development of intuition for phenomenological model building , and address computationally challenging phenomena such as qcd at finite density , extrapolation to low quark masses , or the treatment of large hadronic systems .",
    "a variety of such continuum tools exist : chiral perturbation theory , effective heavy quark and low energy hadronic field theories , 4-dimensional dyson - schwinger methods , fixed gauge hamiltonian qcd approaches , and qcd sum rule methods . in this paper",
    "we focus on hamiltonian qcd in coulomb gauge .",
    "much progress has been made in understanding coulomb gauge qcd since the seminal work of schwinger@xcite , khriplovich@xcite , and christ and lee@xcite .",
    "in particular , the problem of the gribov ambiguity@xcite has been studied and a resolution has been suggested@xcite . the ambiguity arises because of residual gauge freedom after the canonical coulomb gauge fixing condition , @xmath0 is imposed in a nonabelian theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite gribov noted that the multiple - gauge copy ambiguity may be resolved by insisting that the faddeev - popov operator ( to be defined later ) is positive . with the aid of a simple model",
    ", he then showed that this constraint implies the existence of a novel form for the gluon propagator and an enhancement in the faddeev - popov propagator at low momenta .",
    "furthermore , these imply that an enhancement exists in the instantaneous coulomb potential , thereby providing a plausible mechanism for confinement . in a series of recent papers  @xcite",
    ", zwanziger has brought the gribov coulomb gauge confinement scenario onto firm theoretical ground and has demonstrated that a complete definition of the coulomb gauge may be achieved by restricting the gauge fields to the ` fundamental modular region '  defined as the set of gauge fields which form the absolute minima of a suitable functional .",
    "furthermore , the constraint to the fundamental modular region may be imposed by introducing a horizon term through a lagrange multiplier in the hamiltonian .",
    "a key feature of coulomb gauge is that the elimination of nondynamical degrees of freedom creates an instantaneous interaction .",
    "the qed analogue of this is the coulomb potential ; however , the nonabelian nature of qcd causes this instantaneous interaction to depend on the gauge field , making it intrinsically nonperturbative for large fields .",
    "the restriction of the transverse gluon field to the fundamental modular region formally makes the coulomb potential well defined .",
    "it also implies that the faddeev - popov ( fp ) operator which enters in the coulomb potential is positive definite  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this is that one may employ the variational principle to build nonperturbative models of the qcd ground state .",
    "this is a crucial step with many phenomenological repercussions in the methodology we will be advocating .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , the fock space which is built on our variational vacuum consists of quasiparticles ",
    "constituent quarks and gluons .",
    "these degrees of freedom obey dispersion relations with infrared divergences due to the long - range instantaneous coulomb interaction of the bare partons with the mean field vacuum .",
    "this interaction makes colored objects infinitely heavy thus effectively removing them from the physical spectrum .",
    "however , color neutral states remain physical because the infrared singularities responsible for the large self - energies are canceled by infrared divergences responsible for the long - range forces between the constituents .",
    "constructing a quasiparticle basis is a nontrivial step which requires a nonperturbative treatment of qcd and , more directly , the qcd vacuum .",
    "we will show that it is possible to construct such a basis in a self - consistent manner by coupling a specific variational ansatz for the vacuum with the instantaneous interaction between color charges .",
    "the end results are explicit expressions for the wilson confinement interaction , the spectrum of the quasiparticles , and the structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the resulting fock space and effective hamiltonian provide an ideal starting point for the examination of the bound state problem in qcd and provide a direct link between qcd and the phenomenological constituent quark model .",
    "a simplified version of this program has been investigated by the authors and others before  @xcite . in several of these studies",
    "the nonabelian coulomb interaction was replaced by an effective potential between color charges , leading to a relatively simple many - body hamiltonian with two - body interactions between constituents .",
    "the phenomenology of this approach has proven quite successful . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have extended this simple approximation and treated the coulomb kernel in a self - consistent way by considering the effect of resummation of a class of ladder diagrams .",
    "these diagrams originate from dressing the bare @xmath1 coulomb potential with transverse gluons .",
    "as one may expect from the discussion above , the effect of summing these diagrams is an enhancement of the coulomb potential at large distances .",
    "self - consistency appears in the problem because the strength of this enhancement is determined by the spectral properties the transverse gluons in the quasiparticle vacuum .    in this paper",
    "we build on these findings by constructing a fully self - consistent set of equations which describe the gluon dispersion relation , the effective instantaneous interaction , and the structure of the quasiparticle vacuum .",
    "a detailed derivation is given in sec .",
    "this section also contains a brief review of the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge and a discussion of the gribov ambiguity .",
    "we discuss the renormalization procedure and show how the various counterterms in the regularized coulomb gauge hamiltonian may be constrained by physical observables .",

    "ii describes the variational vacuum employed in our method .",
    "section  iii presents the solution to the coupled equations .",
    "we first discuss the details of the renormalization procedure and present an approximate analytical solution which demonstrates many of the features which emerge .",
    "this is followed by a full numerical solution and a discussion of the effects of higher order terms .",
    "a comparison of these results to lattice data is presented in sec .",
    "section  v discusses the implications of our results for the constituent quark model and phenomenology in general .",
    "this includes clarifying several open issues in the cqm and extending the cqm . a comparison to similar approaches and our conclusions",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "one of the advantages of coulomb gauge is that all degrees of freedom are physical .",
    "this makes the qcd hamiltonian close in spirit to quantum mechanical models of qcd , for example the constituent quark model . the intuition gained from several decades of quark model calculations",
    "may then be applied to the analysis of a complex and nonlinear quantum field theory .",
    "additional advantages of coulomb gauge are that gauss s law is built into the hamiltonian , the norm is positive definite , and no additional constraints need be imposed on fock space .",
    "furthermore , retardation effects are minimized for heavy quarks ; thus this is a natural framework for studying nonrelativistic bound states , and in particular for identifying the physical mechanisms which drive relativistic corrections , _",
    "e.g. _ the spin splittings in heavy quarkonia .",
    "since chiral symmetry is dynamically broken this framework is also of relevance for light flavors once the constituent quarks are identified with the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the confinement phenomenon in qcd has two complementary aspects : ( 1 ) there is a long range attractive potential between colored sources ; ( 2 ) the gluons which mediate this force are absent from the spectrum of physical states .",
    "thus the mechanism for confinement is not particularly transparent @xcite in covariant gauges . in coulomb",
    "gauge , in contrast , these two aspects can comfortably co - exist : the long range force is represented by the instantaneous coulomb interaction and is enhanced as @xmath2 , while the physical ( transverse ) gluon propagator is suppressed  reflecting the absence of colored states in the physical spectrum .      since the hamiltonian in coulomb gauge may look unfamiliar to many readers we briefly illustrate the derivation of the classical hamiltonian here .",
    "the chromoelectric field is given by @xmath3 and satisfies gauss s law ,    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the quark color charge density .",
    "these equations are simplified by introducing the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation ,    @xmath6    where @xmath7 are the adjoint representation generators , @xmath8 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) becomes    @xmath9    if the electric field is split into transverse and longitudinal pieces , @xmath10 then eq .  ( [ gauss2 ] )",
    "yields    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the full color charge density , with @xmath13 being the color charge density of transverse gluons .",
    "the equation of motion for the longitudinal component of the electric field ,    @xmath14    leads to a constraint for the 0-th component of the vector potential which can be formally solved .",
    "this yields    @xmath15    and @xmath16 finally the time evolution of the vector potential is determined by the transverse chromoelectric field through    @xmath17    after canonical quantization , the transverse field @xmath18 becomes the momentum conjugate to the transverse vector potential , @xmath19 . passing from the lagrangian to the hamiltonian yields terms proportional to @xmath20 from the longitudinal components of the chromoelectric field in @xmath21 , terms proportional to @xmath22 from the quark gluon vertex , @xmath23 and terms proportional to @xmath24 from the @xmath25 pieces of @xmath21 . combining all these contributions and substituting the expression for @xmath26 from eq .",

    "zwanziger has shown how to derive the coulomb gauge hamiltonian with a lattice regularization@xcite .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian may be derived by transforming the canonical @xmath36 hamiltonian to coulomb gauge .",
    "the @xmath37 hamiltonian corresponds to ` cartesian ' coordinates in a flat gauge manifold , the subsequent restriction to coulomb gauge induces curvature in the gauge manifold and therefore introduces a nontrivial metric .",
    "christ and lee have shown that the measure associated with this metric is proportional to the faddeev - popov determinant    @xmath38    furthermore , the hamiltonian contains factors of @xmath39 which are analogous to the laplace - beltrami operator induced when one first quantizes in curvilinear coordinates .",
    "the faddeev - popov determinant may be removed from the measure by working with the modified hamiltonian    @xmath40    which is hermitian with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "thus the final form for the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge is    @xmath42    where",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    and    @xmath46    in order to compare with the covariant feynman rules and the canonical path integral formalism , it is convenient to weyl order the operators ( we note that weyl ordering is the operator ordering which corresponds to path integral quantization with midpoint discretization ) .",
    "this leads to the schwinger - christ - lee terms , @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xcite . here",
    "we will keep the original ordering of eqs .",
    "( [ tdleeham]-21 ) so that no explicit @xmath47 and @xmath48 terms are present .",
    "as detailed by zwanziger @xcite , not only is the hamiltonian renormalizable in coulomb gauge but the gribov problem can also be resolved @xcite .",
    "the essence of the gribov problem is that the condition @xmath49 does not uniquely fix the gauge in non - abelian gauge theories ; in general there are many copies of gauge field configurations , all with the same divergence , which are related by gauge transformations . alternatively , the canonical transformation to coulomb gauge is not singular so long as @xmath50 .",
    "but gribov has shown that large gauge configurations exist such that this condition does not hold .",
    "as the true physical configuration space of a gauge theory is the set of gauge potentials modulo local gauge transformations , one must select a single representative from each set of gauge - equivalent configurations .",
    "the resulting subset of independent field configurations is known as the fundamental modular region ( fmr ) .",
    "a convenient characterization of the fmr is given by the `` minimal '' coulomb gauge , obtained by minimizing a suitably chosen functional over gauge orbits .",
    "this functional is defined as @xmath51 = { \\rm tr}\\int d^3x ( \\a^g)^2\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a gauge transformation and @xmath53 .",
    "a simple calculation show that fields in the fmr are transverse .",
    "alternatively , zwanziger has demonstrated that gribov copies may be removed by imposing the constraint @xmath54 ( called the horizon condition ) and argued that in the infinite volume limit imposing the horizon condition enables one to remove the direct restriction on the fields .",
    "here @xmath55 is the ` horizon term ' given by @xmath56    in this paper we follow a third approach . because the faddeev - popov operator is positive semi - definite for fields in the fmr , we expand it in a power series over field variables and evaluate matrix elements by integrating over all fields",
    "this is justified as long as the expectation value of the faddeev - popov operator does not change sign .",
    "we discuss under what conditions this procedure is consistent with the horizon condition in sec .",
    "iv.b .      to properly define the hamiltonian a cutoff",
    "must be introduced to regularize ultraviolet divergences .",
    "this can be done , for example , by point splitting products of fields in the hamiltonian .",
    "a simpler regularization procedure , adopted here , is to smear the fields .",
    "the induced nonlocalities are removed as the cutoff is taken to infinity . since in the numerical studies to follow we will be working with renormalized quantities only ( which are cutoff independent )",
    ", we will explicitly remove the regulator making details of the regularization irrelevant .",
    "counterterms need to be added to the canonical hamiltonian to ensure that a cutoff independent spectrum is produced , @xmath57 in this paper we concentrate on the pure glue sector with at most static quarks , and therefore we will ignore the part of the hamiltonian involving momentum or spin of the quarks . in the gluon sector , the presence of the cutoff leads to a single relevant operator ( an operator whose canonical dimension is less then four ) .",

    "for example , as discussed earlier , if the fields are in the fmr the coulomb kernel may be expanded in a power series in @xmath70 , and the order @xmath71 contribution would be proportional to @xmath72^n_\\lambda .",

    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian can , in principle , be expanded in an arbitrarily chosen complete basis which spans fock space .",

    "however , one expects the description of any hadronic bound state would be very complicated in this basis . alternatively",
    ", the phenomenologically successful constituent quark model indicates that hadronic wavefunctions may saturate quickly with only a few fock space states provided these states are constructed from constituent ( quasiparticle ) quarks .",
    "this strongly suggests that a basis which incorporates the effects of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking would be more efficient for describing hadrons and their interactions .",

    "the required cut - off independence of the eigenvalues can be used to determine the @xmath62 dependence of the various counterterms and couplings . at this stage",

    "we note that expanding the fock space in which the hamiltonian is being nonperturbatively diagonalized will add new counterterms to the hamiltonian which will modify the renormalization group equations .",
    "we start by examining the renormalization group structure which follows from the requirement that the gluonic fock space itself is @xmath62 independent .",
    "this implies that the coulomb kernel , and hence @xmath150 and @xmath149 , should be @xmath62-independent .",

    "conversely , all color singlets are ir finite .",

    "the constituent masses are roughly 200 mev and 600 - 800 mev respectively . finally , the spectrum generated by @xmath356 is spin averaged in the sense that it only incorporates spin effects from relativistic corrections to the coulomb potential .",
    "full spin splittings come from @xmath357 .",
    "an important implication of this approach is that the rapid convergence of the constituent quark model fock space expansion has a natural and simple explanation .",
    "all of the corrections induced by @xmath357 ( for nonexotic states ) involve the transfer of a virtual transverse gluon .",
    "since these are quasiparticles in the variational vacuum , the relevant perturbative diagrams are suppressed by the mass gap between the regular and hybrid states .",
    "this simple feature of qcd in coulomb gauge has important phenomenological consequences .",
    "for example , it implies that the fock space expansion converges quickly because state mixing involves the creation of massive gluonic ( or quark ) quasiparticles .",
    "recently , lattice data has appeared which confirms this picture .",
    "et al._@xcite have constructed a simple relativistic quark model of @xmath361 mesons by considering a light relativistic quark ( with kinetic energy @xmath362 ) moving in the lattice @xmath363 potential . detailed comparison with lattice",
    "@xmath361 data demonstrated the high accuracy of the model .",
    "the point which is relevant for our discussion is that the lattice @xmath363 interaction ( recall that this is equivalent in principle and in practice to @xmath282 ) should receive corrections due to the light quark when applied to @xmath361 mesons ; see fig .",
    "[ qcorr ] .",
    "the fact that these corrections are not important demonstrates that they are suppressed , in agreement with the above arguments .    to      one of the benefits of coulomb gauge",
    "is that it makes the source of confinement clear : in the heavy quark limit quarks and transverse gluons decouple and the quark - antiquark quark interaction arises solely from the instantaneous coulomb operator .",
    "this rigorous result has several significant implications for hadronic phenomenology .",
    "first we simplify the situation by noting that higher order terms such as shown in fig .",
    "[ vcorr2 ] are suppressed due to the arguments espoused in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , the dominate interaction between static color sources is the leading kernel in the coulomb interaction , @xmath282 .",
    "as we have seen , this kernel is essentially identical to the lattice wilson loop result , so this conclusion is supported _ a posteriori_.    to    this simple statement carries wide repercussions .",
    "for example , a longstanding cornerstone of quark model phenomenology is that confinement is ` scalar ' .",
    "what this means is that the interaction between quarks is assumed to be    @xmath364    this form ( as opposed to ` vector ' confinement @xmath365 ) is supported by a comparison of the predicted spin splittings in heavy quarkonia with data@xcite .",
    "however , the results presented here make it clear that this conclusion is naive .",
    "the interactions between color sources is more complicated than the simple facsimile given in eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) .",
    "as we have seen , the leading interaction between quarks is given by @xmath282  and this has the form of vector confinement .",
    "what is taken as evidence of the scalar nature of confinement is in fact quarkonium spin splittings which are generated by nonperturbative mixing with intermediate hybrid states via @xmath357 . that this more complicated ( and correct ) picture may look ` scalar ' has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite    another simple conclusion of the picture being developed here is that the confinement potential between color sources scales as the quadratic casimir .",
    "this follows from the observation that the dominant contribution to the confinement potential is given by the leading kernel and that the color structure of this kernel is @xmath366 .",
    "the fact that casimir scaling of the wilson loop potential has been observed repeatedly@xcite may be taken as a successful prediction of our methodology or may be used as further proof that the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ vcorr2 ] are suppressed with respect to @xmath282 .",
    "the methodology presented here allows for the resolution of several open , but often ignored , ambiguities in the constituent quark model .",
    "for example , it is often stated that the linear potential is built from the exchange of infinitely many gluons .",
    "one may then ask why the one gluon exchange potential is retained as an important part of quark model phenomenology .",
    "indeed the split between one gluon exchange color coulomb and hyperfine forces and the multiexchange linear force is necessarily ambiguous .",
    "the resolution to this issue is transparent in coulomb gauge : ` one gluon exchange ' is part of @xmath357 and is due to noninstantaneous transverse gluon exchange .",
    "the instantaneous central portion of the quark model should consist of a linear term in addition to the running resummed ` coulomb ' term of eq .  ( [ fitv ] ) .",
    "no ambiguity exists because of the separation of instantaneous and transverse degrees of freedom inherent in coulomb gauge .",
    "another problem with the old - fashioned cqm has to do with the previously mentioned assumed scalar nature of confinement .",
    "unfortunately , scalar confinement implies that if mesons are bound by a linear potential , baryons are antibound  @xcite .",
    "this is clearly an intolerable situation which is routinely ignored by cqm practitioners . as we have seen , the resolution is that confinement acts as the time component of a vector rather than as a scalar , and no inconsistency exists between mesons and baryons .",
    "we illustrate the power of our approach by considering the vexing problem of strong decays in hadronic physics .",
    "the strong decays of hadrons has been , and remains , a mystery of soft qcd . the naive perturbative assumption that the decay proceeds via one gluon dissociation ( fig .",
    "[ decays]b ) is proven incorrect by direct comparison with experiment@xcite .",
    "the only reasonably successful phenomenology is provided by the ` @xmath367 ' model@xcite , where quark pairs are assumed to appear with vacuum quantum numbers over all space .",
    "this is clearly an unacceptable situation , especially given the ubiquity of hadronic decays and the fact that they provide a window into the dynamics of glue at low energy .",
    "we now examine the predictions of the new quark model presented here .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath368 and to all orders in the coupling , the only diagrams which contribute to meson decay ( here all mesons are assumed to have fock expansions which are dominated by the quasiquark - quasiantiquark components ) are shown in fig .",

    "however , its apparently successful extension to light quark states is unexpected and surprising . we seek to understand this observation in this subsection .",
    "the major feature of light quark physics is spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "one may regard this as occurring due to the appearance of a quark - antiquark vacuum condensate .",
    "the interactions which generate the condensate are typically associated with an effective instanton interaction@xcite or the confinement potential@xcite .",
    "( in our approach the driving kernel would be @xmath282 ) .",
    "regardless of the particular mechanism which causes attraction in the scalar channel , a massive constituent quark is the necessary outcome .",
    "indeed , while bare quarks may become very light or massless , the relevant quasiparticles saturate at roughly 200 mev as the bare quark mass is reduced@xcite .",
    "this , at least partly , explains the apparent success of the nonrelativistic portion of the cqm .",
    "the agreement is also enhanced by the empirical accident that the expectation value of @xmath375 is very close to @xmath376 in typical hadronic states .",
    "more important than this ; however , is the nature of the central potential itself when the bare quarks are light . as discussed above ,",
    "effects due to one gluon exchange are suppressed by powers of @xmath368 .",
    "thus the main effect due to light quarks is the presence of intermediate quark loops in the instantaneous interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) .",
    "these diagrams cause string breaking which is an important feature of qcd .",
    "however , as isgur has argued@xcite , the main consequence of this is simply to renormalize the string tension .",
    "thus light quark loops have little effect on the phenomenology arising from @xmath356 .",

    "the instantaneous coulomb potential may be incorporated into @xmath356 ( as is done in atomic physics ) and a viable bound state perturbation theory may be constructed .",
    "this simple step already obviates one of the severe problems of perturbative qcd in describing hadronic properties , namely that of ill - defined asymptotic states .    while the division of the qcd hamiltonian is a simple task , it is essentially meaningless because the degrees of freedom represented in @xmath356 are partonic . thus building bound states",
    "would be a frustrating exploration of the depths of fock space rather than the preliminary step for bound state perturbation theory we desire it to be .",
    "the experience provided by the constituent quark model points the way out of the impasse : appropriate ( constituent ) degrees of freedom must be employed .",
    "the problem in the past ( cf .",
    "constituent quark models , bag models , flux tube models , etc ) has been in finding a way to introduce effective degrees of freedom in such a way that the connection to qcd is not destroyed .",
    "herein we present one way to do this which is based on experience gleaned from many - body physics often used in phenomenological models _",
    "e.g. _ the nambu  jona - lasinio model@xcite .",
    "specifically , a canonical transformation to a quasiparticle basis which is defined with respect to a nontrivial variational vacuum is made .",
    "the theory remains qcd but is given in terms of a useful and tractable basis .",
    "although the vacuum state is necessarily an ansatz , this does not vitiate the construction  in principle _ any _ basis may be used , we merely seek an efficient one , and the vacuum itself may be systematically improved with standard techniques .",
    "one finds a welcome complication when these ideas are applied to nonabelian gauge theory : the interaction which is needed to define the vacuum ansatz and the quasiparticle spectrum ( via the gap equation ) itself depends on the vacuum .",
    "thus the fundamental quasiparticle interaction and the quasiparticles themselves are inextricably interdependent .",
    "solving the gap equations requires the evaluation of the specific functional dependence of the quasiparticle interaction on the vector potential .",
    "we have chosen to do this within the rainbow ladder approximation .",
    "there are several important points to make at this stage : ( 1 ) the rainbow ladder approximation may be improved at will , ( 2 ) the approximation is accurate in the large @xmath377 limit , ( 3 ) the approximation is accurate in the infrared limit , ( 4 ) the approximation is justified _ a posteriori_.",
    "lastly , although the approximation can not yield nonperturbative results , true nonperturbative physics may be generated when the resummed kernel is incorporated in the nonlinear coupled gap equations .",
    "doing so reveals a pleasant surprise : the emergence of the confinement phenomenon .",
    "while it is gratifying that color confinement is produced by our approach , this result would be useless if it did not match phenomenology .",
    "the fact that the effective quasiparticle potential matches the lattice static quark potential very well points to the general utility of our method .",
    "thus eqs .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) and ( [ hint ] ) represent much more than a simple reordering of the qcd hamiltonian . by building @xmath356 as an effective hamiltonian describing the interactions of quasiparticles on a nontrivial vacuum we are able to establish contact with the constituent quark model and derive confinement . that both of these emerge in our formalism",
    "bodes well for the future success of @xmath356 as a robust starting point for detailed hadronic computations .",
    "an important test of any new method in qcd is its ability to provide insight into a variety of phenomena .",
    "we have tried to demonstrate the robustness of our method in this regard .",
    "a vital aspect of this robustness is the emergence of @xmath368 as an expansion parameter .",
    "this provides the justification for gluonic fock space truncation , for the validity of the leading static coulomb kernel @xmath282 , and for the applicability of the static kernel to light quarks .",
    "indeed , the method strongly hints as to why the constituent quark model works for light quarks . to summarize",
    ", quarks never become truly light ( but saturate at constituent masses ) , the static kernel is not strongly affected by the presence of light quarks , and parameter freedom in the definition of the quark model allows for an accurate reproduction of the relativistic quark kinetic energy and the chirally - driven meson hyperfine splitting .",
    "the ideas we have presented have had a long period of development starting with gribov s speculation that confinement may arise naturally when resolving the gauge copy problem . in the early 1980 s finger and mandula@xcite , adler and davis@xcite , and le  yaouanc _ et al._@xcite all considered the generation of constituent quark masses and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with simple ( often of the form given in eq .",
    "[ naive ] ) models of qcd .",
    "the issue of renormalization was taken up by these papers and in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the work which is closest to ours is that of zwanziger@xcite and swift@xcite . as discussed in sec .",
    "iv.b , zwanziger has shown that the imposition of the horizon condition implies that the faddeev - popov propagator is enhanced in the infrared .",
    "as we have stressed , an enhancement of the fp propagator is sufficient to cause confinement . in ref .",
    "@xcite zwanziger has shown that adding the horizon term to the hamiltonian produces an effective gluon mass which in turn induces the desired enhancement of the vev of the faddeev - popov operator .",
    "zwanziger then makes several simplifying assumptions to arrive at an estimate for the coulomb kernel .",
    "chief among these are an assumed form for the gluon dispersion relation , a simplified version of the faddeev - popov propagator integral equation , and the approximation @xmath378 .",
    "the end results are similar to ours ; zwanziger obtains @xmath379 ( we get @xmath380 ) and @xmath381 .",
    "our analytical approximation gives @xmath382 while the numerical solution is very nearly linear .",
    "the work of swift@xcite is very similar to ours in philosophy .",
    "in fact our self - consistent equations for the leading rainbow - ladder gap equations , which were derived in the hamiltonian formalism , agree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which were derived in the greens function formalism .",
    "however , a difference occurs in the renormalization of the mass gap equation : we find that only one subtraction is necessary to render the equation finite .",
    "thus no counterterm proportional to @xmath383 is required .",
    "this is due to the logarithmic suppression of the potential at large momenta .    the main difference between the current paper and ref .",
    "@xcite is in the analysis of the gap equations .",
    "we have obtained very good analytic and full numerical solutions to the coupled gap equations .",
    "this was not attempted in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the author did examine the small momentum behaviour of the faddeev - popov propagator and the coulomb kernel assuming a particular form for the gap function .",
    "his fp and gap functions agree with our analytical estimates , however his solution for the potential has an unexpected imaginary portion .",
    "we believe this is due to an approximation which generated a confinement potential which was more singular than @xmath384 .    a preliminary exploration of the work presented here was undertaken in ref .",
    "this reference neglected the fp determinant and higher order contributions to the gap equation .",
    "furthermore , the full coulomb kernel was drastically simplified by taking it to be the summation of the one loop expression for @xmath93 . despite these simplifications and assumptions",
    "the resulting potential was similar to that obtained here .",
    "this is perhaps an indication of the power of the coupled quasiparticle / vacuum approach .",
    "we regard the present work as a promising start to the construction of a new quark model of the strong interactions in particular with regard to the treatment of gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "future projects include the evaluation of all @xmath353 correction terms to the gap equation which are needed to test the gribov - zwanziger gluonic quasiparticle spectral function .",
    "we also intend to evaluate a broad swath of the meson , baryon , glueball , and hybrid spectra , and to compute the heavy hybrid adiabatic energy surfaces .",
    "the latter two test the utility of the gluonic quasiparticles as effective degrees of freedom and will probe the structure of @xmath282 and @xmath371 .",
    "general considerations ( and explicit lattice evidence ) lead one to expect that glue behaves as a collective stringlike degree of freedom at large distances .",
    "we expect the gluonic quasiparticles to provide a useful description of glue at small ( less than 1 fermi ) and intermediate ( 1 - 2 fermi ) scales",
    ". it will be interesting to see if the formalism presented here allows for effective stringlike behavior at large distances .",
    "finally , @xmath385 mixing is a longstanding issue in soft qcd related to the anomaly , vacuum structure , the gluonic content of mesons , and instantons .",
    "examining this problem should prove informative for the further development of the quark sector of our theory .",
