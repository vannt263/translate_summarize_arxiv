    "the fusion hindrance that appears in heavy ion reactions has been known for many years . now",
    "the mechanism of fusion hindrance is gradually understood as to be due to an extra internal barrier between the touching configuration and the compound shape after overcoming the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "however what causes the internal barrier is a difficult problem .",
    "one of the hypotheses is that the internal barrier could be thought as the conditional saddle point in the liquid - drop potential as well as could be attributed to an effective barrier due to the dissipation of the incident kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "since there are two barriers for the fusion , its theoretical description is divided into two consecutive steps : one is from infinity to the contact configuration passing over the coulomb barrier , and another one is from the contact point to the compound state overcoming the internal barrier .",
    "this so - called two - step model explains the extra - push energy and furthermore gives an energy dependent fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "the measured residue cross section can be calculated by plugging a statistical evaporation model on the two - step model .",
    "to evaluate the amplitude of the hindrance to the fusion , the size of the inner barrier is not enough .",
    "the dissipation mechanism also plays an important role and one has to solve dynamically the diffusion over this barrier .",
    "this was done analytically in one dimensional case assuming a parabolic barrier @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus our attention on the appearance of the hindrance to the fusion that is due to the saddle point height measured from the energy of the touching configuration formed by the projectile and target nuclei of the incident channel .",
    "in other words , there is no hindrance for cases without internal barrier .",
    "therefore , the border between the normal and the hindered fusion is given by the condition that the contact configuration be on the top of the saddle point .",
    "for mass - symmetric reactions , the fusion path between the touching configuration and the compound shape can be easily determined since the system evolves only along the radial degree of freedom . in order to determine",
    "if the fusion hindrance occurred for a given reaction , we simply compare the position of the barrier and the touching configuration : the fusion exists while the barrier is located inner side of the touching point and vice versa .",
    "@xcite systematically analyzed different symmetric reactions and drew a clear border between the two kinds of reactions ( with and without fusion hindrance ) .",
    "how is the situation for mass - asymmetric cases ?",
    "generally this problem becomes difficult because the system crosses a ridgeline , not a saddle .",
    "it is then difficult to determine an effective reaction coordinate .",
    "however there is a way to avoid the difficulty : let the reactions evolve starting from the contact point on the potential surface without any random force , and then check if the compound state is reached .",
    "if the composite system evolves toward the compound direction , it means that there is no barrier between contact point and compound state , and thus the fusion hindrance does not exist .",
    "otherwise , the fusion hindrance occurs . with this method , the current paper studies the occurrence of the fusion hindrance for asymmetric reactions .",
    "@xcite show that the neck of the amalgamated system also plays an important role in the hindrance to the fusion .",
    "thus , one of the related questions is about the evolution of neck degree of freedom : is there also a fusion hindrance in the neck evolution , like for radial evolution ?",
    "we will answer to these questions in the present paper .",
    "there are several ways to parameterize the shape of the amalgamated system . in this paper",
    "we use the so - called two - center parameterization @xcite based on three important parameters which are : the distance between two centers @xmath3 , the mass - asymmetry parameter @xmath0 , and the neck parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 is defined as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the distance between two centers of the harmonic potentials , and @xmath7 the radius of the spherical compound nucleus .",
    "the mass - asymmetry parameter is defined as usual , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mass numbers of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the neck parameter @xmath4 is defined by the ratio of the smoothed height at the connection point of the two harmonic potentials and that of spiked potential . in this description",
    ", nuclear shape is defined by equipotential surfaces with a constant volume .",
    "for example , @xmath11 means no correction , i.e. , complete di - nucleus shape , while @xmath12 means no spike , i.e. , flatly connected potential , which describes highly deformed mono - nucleus .",
    "thus , the neck describes shape evolution of the compound system from di - nucleus to mono - nucleus .",
    "the initial value of @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , for a given reaction at the touching point is @xmath13 respectively . here",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) stands for the mass number of the projectile ( target ) . with this parameterization ,",
    "the liquid drop model ( ldm ) potential is adopted to calculate the energy of the touching di - nucleus .",
    "these three parameters are connected by the potential , the inertia and friction tensors . for the sake of comprehension",
    ", we will study the neck and the radial degrees of freedom separately .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on the potential landscape seen by the neck parameter .",
    "let us recall that in the two - step model , the fusion hindrance is described as the additional barrier hampering the evolution from the contact point to the compound nucleus .     for @xmath16kr+@xmath17pb at various relative distances.,width=275,height=261 ]    in order to show the direction of evolution of the neck degree of freedom , the ldm potential is plotted as a function of @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , where the different lines correspond to different distances between the projectile and target .",
    "the figure shows two different directions of evolution : ( i ) at small @xmath3 ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) the potential decreases with reducing neck parameter ( thicker neck ) which means that at contact the neck becomes thick by the driving effect of the potential .",
    "( ii ) at large @xmath3 ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) , the potential increases with reducing neck parameter around @xmath22 and a bump exists at a critical value of @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that an extra energy should be provided to reach the thick neck , i.e. to form a mono - nucleus . in other words ,",
    "the system is hindered to form a compound nucleus .",
    "in fact , the frontier between the two cases can be determined by the slope of the potential at the point @xmath23 : @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes for the ldm potential . positive @xmath26 and negative @xmath26 correspond to the first case and the second case , respectively .",

    "the potentials in this figure are referred to the potential at the spherical compound state . at small relative distances @xmath3 ( the red dashed line ) ,",
    "reducing @xmath4 from @xmath23 means decreasing the surface and thus the corresponding surface potential , while the coulomb potential becomes larger ( fig .",
    "[ fig - shape](b ) ) . since the surface potential reduces faster than the increasing of the coulomb potential , the total potential becomes smaller with reducing @xmath4 , as shown by the red dashed line in fig .",

    "[ fig - shape](a)(b ) . while at larger @xmath3 , shown by the blue dash - dotted line , the surface area is stable with reducing @xmath4 around @xmath4 = 1 and thus the total potential is increasing while neck starts to evolve from @xmath11 .",

    "different combinations of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 for different neutron number @xmath36 and proton number @xmath37 of a compound nucleus are systematically studied and the results are shown in fig .",

    "the line of @xmath38-stability is also plotted . inside the borderlines , the slope",
    "@xmath26 is greater than 0 and the reactions are not hindered , while outside the lines it is the opposite .    comparing the area encircled with different lines",
    ", it also shows that the number of reactions without neck fusion hindrance for small @xmath0 is smaller than for large @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that more symmetric reactions correspond to larger coulomb repulsion force which leads the coulomb potential to increase more quickly with reducing @xmath4 .",
    "since the encircled area is very large even for @xmath0 = 0 , the neck evolution is not hindered for most of the realistic reactions .",
    "we have just concluded that the neck evolution is not hindered for most of the realistic reactions .",
    "in fact , once at contact a strong potential slope drives the neck degree of freedom toward a mono - nucleus shape . on the other hand ,",
    "the radial and mass - asymmetry degrees of freedom face a potential barrier for systems with hindered fusion . as a consequence ,",
    "the neck degree of freedom evolves faster than the other two .",
    "it has reached equilibrium before the diffusion over the potential barrier has started @xcite .",
    "as most of the di - nucleus evolve along @xmath3 and @xmath0 direction with an equilibrated neck parameter , we study the fusion hindrance in the rest two degrees of freedom at the equilibrated value of @xmath4 .     for different symmetric or asymmetric reactions to form @xmath39po.,width=271,height=274 ]",
    "the neck parameter at equilibrium can be determined through the average of @xmath4 via @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the temperature of the system . as shown in fig .",

    ", @xmath44 is close to 0.1 .",
    "therefore we take @xmath45 in the next calculations .",
    "this value is also used in the calculation of fusion cross section for @xmath46ca induced reactions in the two - step model , and with which the residue cross sections are calculated combining the statistical evaporation model @xcite . by introducing a shell energy reduction factor , the calculated residue cross sections show good agreement with experimental data from ca + u to ca + bk .",
    "based on the ldm , when the projectile and target evolve from the contact point to the compound state , the parameters \\{@xmath0 , @xmath3 } change from \\{@xmath47 , @xmath48 } to \\{@xmath0 = 0 , @xmath3 = 0 } in the same time .",
    "however because the ldm potential as a function of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 is similar to a parabolic potential centered at @xmath49 , the evolving system is not hindered in the mass - asymmetry direction .",
    "therefore we only need to consider the fusion hindrance in the radial direction .",
    "since the friction in the @xmath0 and @xmath3 direction is close to each other , the radial direction can not be de - coupled from the mass - asymmetry direction .",
    "thus in the analysis of the radial fusion hindrance we will consider @xmath0 and @xmath3 direction in the same footing .",
    "it is easier to understand the radial fusion hindrance in symmetric reactions by simply comparing the contact point and the saddle point , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig - rfh ] shows the location of the borderline between hindered and non - hindered reactions for various asymmetries @xmath0 .",
    "for the reactions located on the borderlines , the contact points are just located on the ridgeline , while for the reactions located inside the borderlines and outside the borderlines , the contact points are located inside and outside of the ridgeline , respectively .",
    "therefore all of the reactions located outside of the ridgelines need extra - push energy to reach the compound state , or in other words , these reactions have radial fusion hindrance .",
    "[ fig - rfh ] also shows that the number of reactions without fusion hindrance at large @xmath0 is larger than that at small @xmath0 as it is well known experimentally .",
    "this can be easily understood : more symmetric reactions ( with small @xmath0 ) have larger repulsive coulomb potential ( @xmath54 ) and the ridgeline is closer to or even shifted into the left side of the contact points . in the same time , with reducing @xmath0 , the contact point @xmath52 becomes larger , as indicated in eq .",

    "this is probably caused by the too few parameters used to describe the so complicated liquid drop energy in ref .",

    "a strong potential slope always drives it toward a mono - nucleus shape .",
    "it is not the case for the radial degree of freedom .",
