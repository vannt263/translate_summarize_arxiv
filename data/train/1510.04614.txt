    "by uniform convexity of the fluxes @xmath6 , we mean @xmath14 and there exists a positive constant @xmath15 such that @xmath16    the first order partial differential equation of type ( [ bv11 ] ) has many applications namely , modeling gravity , continuous sedimentation in a clarifier - thickener unit , petroleum industry , traffic flow on a highway , semiconductor industry . for more details , one can see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is well known that even if the flux and the initial data are sufficiently smooth the global classical solution of scalar conservation laws , does not exist always , which allows to define the weak notion of the solution",
    ". in general , there might be infinitely many weak solutions even for smooth flux .",
    "moreover , the well - posedness theory for the cauchy problem for scalar conservation laws with lipschitz flux function was completely settled by kruzkov @xcite .",
    "in past few decades , the cauchy problem for conservation laws with discontinuous flux of the type ( [ bv11 ] ) has been well studied , it has been tackled in several ways . for convergence analysis of several important numerical schemes we refer to @xcite .",
    "the solution of ( [ bv11 ] ) can be achieved by vanishing viscosity limit @xcite , front tracking ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , one can obtain the solution of ( [ bv11 ] ) also via hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite , which is the one we exploit in the present paper .",
    "consider the following hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath17    in @xcite , they dealt with the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ bv12 ] ) and proved the existence of the global lipschitz solution of ( [ bv12 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath18 , solves the discontinuous conservation laws ( [ bv11 ] ) with the initial data @xmath19 .",
    "also they proved the existence of infinitely many stable semigroups of entropy solutions based on @xmath20 interface entropy condition ( see definition [ definitioninter ] ) .",
    "for any such choice of @xmath21 , they have given an explicit representation of the entropy solution for the conservation law ( [ bv11 ] ) . throughout our paper",
    "we use the @xmath20 entropy solution ( see definition [ definitionsol ] ) obtained as in @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the subject is well studied , the total variation bound near the interface remained unsolved for quite a long time . in @xcite , they observed that the solution stays in bv , away from the interface @xmath22 .",
    "recently , in @xcite the question regarding the total variation bound near interface has been answered . in general",
    ", bv regularity of the solution is an extremely important phenomenon in the theory of conservation laws . for the case",
    "when @xmath23 ( not necessarily convex ) , total variation diminishing ( tvd ) property holds , that is to say , @xmath24 , for all @xmath25 definitely , one can not expect to have similar property in the case when @xmath26 because of the fact that constant initial data may lead to a non constant solution .",
    "the first breakthrough results regarding the total variation bound have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "first it was observed in @xcite that the critical points plays a key role for the existence and nonexistence of total variation bound .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that if the connections @xmath20 avoid the critical points @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then the bv regularity holds .",
    "they observed in @xcite that @xmath28 is not enough , one needs to assume also @xmath29 in order to prove that the solution is bv near the interface .",
    "also they have constructed a counter example by rarefaction waves and shock waves separated by constant states near the interface to prove that total variation of the solution at time @xmath30 may blow up even if @xmath31 hence the assumption @xmath32 are important .",
    "later on in @xcite , it has been proved that if the connections @xmath20 avoid the critical points @xmath27 and @xmath33 then @xmath34 for @xmath35 also a very strong and surprising result has been obtained in @xcite that if the lower heights of both the fluxes are same that is if @xmath36 then the solution stays in bv near the interface , even if the fluxes are not uniformly convex or even if @xmath37 on the other hand , if @xmath38 then the results does not hold in general ( for instance the counter example in @xcite at @xmath30 ) . if @xmath38 then one needs to put an extra assumption that supp @xmath39 is compact , then the result holds true for uniformly convex flux , but for large time .",
    "one can not avoid to assume that the initial data @xmath39 is compactly supported due to the counter example ( in @xcite ) , which shows that even for uniformly convex fluxes , @xmath40 while @xmath28 , for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    when @xmath43 we have the following lax - oleinik formula :    [ thm1.1 ] ( lax - oleinik formula ) let the initial data @xmath44 .",
    "if the flux @xmath10 is @xmath45 , uniformly convex and of super linear growth . then there exists a function @xmath46 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath47 is non decreasing .",
    "2 .   for a.e . @xmath48",
    ", the solution @xmath49 of ( [ bv11 ] ) is given by @xmath50    an immediate observation from theorem [ thm1.1 ] is the following :    if @xmath51 and then for all @xmath52 is in @xmath53 even if @xmath37 when the flux is not uniformly convex , in the case @xmath23 , bv regularity does not hold for @xmath8 , even for large time ( one can see a counter example in @xcite , though @xmath54 ) . for finer properties of characteristics in the case @xmath23",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",

    "the result in this paper is very surprising because , even if @xmath43 but not uniformly convex then in general there does not exist any region where the solution stays bv for @xmath1 initial data , in other words , for @xmath23 and nonuniform convex fluxes one can always choose some @xmath8 such that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is an interval in @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( one can see the details in @xcite ) .",
    "this happens due to the lack of lipschitz continuity of @xmath85 .",
    "here in this article we prove that near the interface i.e , in the region @xmath86 , either the solution does not oscillates too much or @xmath87 are lipschitz continuous .",
    "note that for @xmath88 , the characteristic passing through the point @xmath89 , bended before time @xmath90 if and only if @xmath91 the paper present a special case in which one can prove bv regularity for the solution near the interface ( starting from @xmath1 data ) without enforcing the assumption on uniform convexity of the flux . however , the price to pay in order to relax the hypothesis on uniform convexity is not negligible .",
    "our proof relies on the explicit lax - oleinik type formulas obtained in @xcite and the finer analysis of the characteristics curves @xcite .    in order to make the present article self contained , we describe enough prerequisites in section 2 before presenting the main results in section 3",
