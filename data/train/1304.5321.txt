    "[ comp - aa - ad - mt ] ( a ) shows the ratio @xmath1 obtained using the present approach and the ns11 approach in the presence of micro - turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the difference between the results obtained using these different methods mainly exists in the transition region @xmath153 .",
    "[ comp - aa - ad - mt ] ( b ) shows the comparison of @xmath1 profiles computed using angle - averaged and angle - dependent redistribution matrices .",
    "for aa computations , we use redistribution matrices computed in aa domains ( approximation iii of @xcite ) , and for ad computations the corresponding ad redistribution matrices are computed in ad domains ( approximation ii of @xcite ) .",
    "three different sets of results are presented in fig .",
    "[ comp - aa - ad - mt ] ( b ) , namely non - magnetic , deterministic field , and micro - turbulent field results .",
    "we see that in the case of hanle effect with micro - turbulent magnetic field , there is depolarization in the line core and in the near wing frequencies as compared to the other two cases .",
    "our studies show that in the case of hanle effect with micro - turbulent magnetic field , the differences between angle - averaged and angle - dependent results are prominent in thin slab cases and reduce considerably in thick slab cases .",
    "these differences between aa and ad results , especially in the @xmath153 region ( apart from the line core ) , were already noticed by @xcite , for the deterministic magnetic field case .",
    "it is interesting to note that such differences get enhanced in the presence of a micro - turbulent magnetic field .",
    "this is probably because of the localization of line photons within the micro - turbulent scattering eddies , resulting in a relatively larger number of scattering .",
    "these differences are present both in the crd scattering mechanism ( see @xcite ) , as well as prd as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ comp - aa - ad - mt ] ( b ) .",
    "we have solved the angle - dependent hanle scattering problem using angle - dependent partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) theory ( approximation ii of @xcite ) .",
    "this computationally expensive problem is solved using an iterative method based on the neumann series expansion ( sem ) .",
    "following @xcite we decompose the stokes parameters in terms of azimuthally symmetric fourier coefficients , by expanding the hanle redistribution matrix in terms of the radiation azimuth @xmath3 .",
    "only such a decomposition allows the use of angle - dependent frequency domains for solving angle - dependent hanle scattering problems .",
    "in contrast a decomposition , based on the expansion in terms of @xmath79 , as done in ns11 , does not allow the use of angle - dependent domains to solve angle - dependent hanle scattering problem .",
    "for this reason a simpler approach was suggested by ns11 which used angle - averaged frequency domains ( approximation iii of @xcite ) , to solve angle - dependent hanle transfer problem .",
    "we show that their approach does not always hold good .",
    "we have carried out a numerical study to show the differences between the solutions obtained by ns11 approach and the self - consistent approach used now in this paper .",
    "the @xmath138 profiles in particular show significant differences in the core to wing transition region ( @xmath153 ) of the line .",
    "the special case of vertical field hanle effect is considered as a case study , and the differences between the ns11 and the present approach are examined .",
    "it is shown that the present method offers a self - consistent and accurate method of solving the difficult problem of ad partial redistribution with hanle scattering .",
    "the interesting behavior of @xmath1 profiles in the presence of micro - turbulent magnetic fields is also examined .",
    "we show that the differences between angle - averaged and angle - dependent solutions are enhanced by the presence of a micro - turbulent field .",
    "the differences are noticed in both the line core and near wing regions ( @xmath170 ) .",
