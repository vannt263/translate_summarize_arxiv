    "the weibull distribution is a popular distribution widely used for analyzing lifetime data .",
    "we work with the beta weibull ( bw ) distribution because of the wide applicability of the weibull distribution and the fact that it extends some recent developed distributions .",
    "this generalization may attract wider application in reliability and biology .",
    "we derive explicit closed form expressions for the distribution function and for the moments of the bw distribution .",
    "an application is illustrated to a real data set with the hope that it will attract more applications in reliability and biology , as well as in other areas of research .",
    "the bw distribution stems from the following general class : if @xmath0 denotes the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of a random variable then a generalized class of distributions can be defined by @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the incomplete beta function ratio , @xmath5 is the incomplete beta function , @xmath6 is the beta function and @xmath7 is the gamma function .",
    "this class of generalized distributions has been receiving increased attention over the last years , in particular after the recent works of eugene et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and jones ( 2004 ) .",
    "eugene et al . ( 2002 ) introduced what is known as the beta normal distribution by taking @xmath8 in ( [ betadist ] ) to be the cdf of the normal distribution with parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the only properties of the beta normal distribution known are some first moments derived by eugene et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and some more general moment expressions derived by gupta and nadarajah ( 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , nadarajah and kotz ( 2004 ) were able to provide closed form expressions for the moments , the asymptotic distribution of the extreme order statistics and the estimation procedure for the beta gumbel distribution .",
    "another distribution that happens to belong to ( [ betadist ] ) is the log@xmath11 ( or beta logistic ) distribution , which has been around for over 20 years ( brown et al . , 2002 ) , even if it did not originate directly from ( [ betadist ] ) .",
    "while the transformation ( [ betadist ] ) is not analytically tractable in the general case , the formulae related with the bw turn out manageable ( as it is shown in the rest of this paper ) , and with the use of modern computer resources with analytic and numerical capabilities , may turn into adequate tools comprising the arsenal of applied statisticians .",
    "the current work represents an advance in the direction traced by nadarajah and kotz ( 2006 ) , contrary to their belief that some mathematical properties of the bw distribution are not tractable .",
    "thus , following ( [ betadist ] ) and replacing @xmath8 by the cdf of a weibull distribution with parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we obtain the cdf of the bw distribution @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding probability density function ( pdf ) and the hazard rate function associated with ( [ bwdist ] ) are : @xmath18^{a-1 } , \\ ] ] and @xmath19^{a-1 } } { b_{1 - { \\rm exp}\\{-(\\lambda x)^c\\}}(a , b ) } , \\ ] ] respectively .",
    "simulation from ( [ bwpdf ] ) is easy : if @xmath20 is a random number following a beta distribution with parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 then @xmath23 will follow a bw distribution with parameters @xmath24 and @xmath13",
    ". some mathematical properties of the bw distribution are given by famoye et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lee et al .",
    ".    graphical representation of equations ( [ bwpdf ] ) and ( [ bwhaz ] ) for some choices of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are given in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that a single weibull distribution for the particular choice of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 is here generalized by a family of curves with a variety of shapes , shown in these figures .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we obtain some expansions for the cdf of the bw distribution , and point out some special cases that have been considered in the literature . in section 3 , we derive explicit closed form expressions for the moments and present skewness and kurtosis for different parameter values .",
    "section 4 gives an expansion for its moment generating function . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the maximum likelihood estimation and provide the elements of the fisher information matrix",
    ". in section 6 , an application to real data is presented , and finally , in section 7 , we provide some conclusions . in the appendix , two identities needed in section 3 are derived .     the probability density function ( [ bwpdf ] ) of the bw distribution , for several values of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , width=480 ]     the hazard function ( [ bwhaz ] ) of the bw distribution , for several values of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , width=480 ]",
    "the bw distribution is an extended model to analyze more complex data and generalizes some recent developed distributions . in particular",
    ", the bw distribution contains the exponentiated weibull distribution ( for instance , see mudholkar et al . , 1995 , mudholkar and hutson , 1996 , nassar and eissa , 2003 , nadarajah and gupta , 2005 and choudhury , 2005 ) as special cases when @xmath27 .",
    "the weibull distribution ( with parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) is clearly a special case for @xmath28 . when @xmath29 , ( [ bwpdf ] ) follows a weibull distribution with parameters @xmath30 and @xmath12 .",
    "the beta exponential distribution ( nadarajah and kotz , 2006 ) is also a special case for @xmath31 .    in what follows ,",
    "we provide two simple formulae for the cdf ( [ bwdist ] ) , depending on whether the parameter @xmath2 is real non - integer or integer , which may be used for further analytical or numerical analysis . starting from the explicit expression for the cdf ( [ bwdist ] ) @xmath32^{a-1 } dy,\\ ] ] the change of variables @xmath33 yields @xmath34",
    "if @xmath2 is real non - integer we have",
    "@xmath35 it follows that @xmath36 finally , we obtain @xmath37 for positive real non - integer @xmath21 , the expansion ( [ bwdistexp ] ) may be used for further analytical and/or numerical studies . for integer @xmath21",
    "we only need to change the formula used in ( [ expreal ] ) to the binomial expansion to give @xmath38    when both @xmath21 and @xmath39 are integers , the relation of the incomplete beta function to the binomial expansion gives    @xmath40^{j}{\\rm exp}\\{-(n - j)(\\lambda x)^c\\}.\\ ] ]    it can be found in the wolfram functions site that for integer @xmath21 @xmath41 and for integer @xmath22 , @xmath42    then , if @xmath21 is integer , we have another equivalent form for ( [ bwdistexpint ] ) @xmath43^{j}.\\ ] ] for integer values of @xmath22 , we have @xmath44^a}{\\gamma(a ) } \\sum_{j=0}^{b-1}\\frac{\\gamma(a+j)}{j!}{\\rm exp}\\{-j(\\lambda x)^c\\}.\\ ] ] finally , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 the particular cases ( [ part2 ] ) and ( [ part3 ] ) were discussed generally by jones ( 2004 ) , and the expansions ( [ bwdistexp])-([part4 ] ) reduce to nadarajah and kotz s ( 2006 ) results for the beta exponential distribution by setting @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , the expansions for the bw density function are obtained from ( [ bwdistexp ] ) and ( [ bwdistexpint ] ) by simple differentiation .",
    "hence , the bw density function can be expressed in a mixture form of weibull density functions .",
    "let @xmath48 be a bw random variable following the density function ( [ bwpdf ] ) .",
    "we now derive explicit expressions for the moments of @xmath48 .",
    "we now introduce the following notation ( for any real @xmath49 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 positive ) @xmath50 the change of variables @xmath51 immediately yields @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand , the change of variables @xmath53 gives the following relation @xmath54^{a-1 } dy = \\frac{\\lambda^{-\\gamma}}{c } s_{\\frac{\\gamma}{c},b , a},\\ ] ] from which it follows that @xmath55 or , equivalently , for any real @xmath56 @xmath57 relating @xmath58 to the @xmath56th generalized moment of the beta weibull .",
    "first , we consider the integral ( [ sdba ] ) when @xmath49 is an integer .",
    "let @xmath59 be a random variable following the beta@xmath60 distribution with pdf @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "further , let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the cdf s of @xmath59 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath66 .",
    "further , by the properties of the lebesgue - stiltjes integral , we have @xmath67 thus , the values of @xmath68 for integer values of @xmath49 can be found from the moments of @xmath65 if they are known .",
    "however , the moment generating function ( mgf ) @xmath69 of @xmath65 can be expressed as @xmath70 this formula is well defined for @xmath71 .",
    "however , we are only interested in the limit @xmath72 and therefore this expression can be used for the current purpose .",
    "we can write @xmath73 from equations ( [ rel2 ] ) and ( [ sinteiro ] ) for any positive integer @xmath74 we obtain a general formula @xmath75 as particular cases , we can see directly from ( [ sinteiro ] ) that @xmath76 and @xmath77,\\ ] ] and by using ( [ rel2 ] ) we find @xmath78 and @xmath79 the same results can also be obtained directly from ( [ kcmoment ] ) .",
    "note that the formula for @xmath80 matches the one just given after equation ( 12 ) .",
    "since the bw distribution for @xmath31 reduces to the beta exponential distribution , the above formulae for @xmath81 and @xmath82 reduce to the corresponding ones obtained by nadarajah and kotz ( 2006 ) .",
    "our main goal here is to give the @xmath56th moment of @xmath48 for every positive integer @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , in what follows we obtain the @xmath56th generalized moment for every real @xmath56 which may be used for further theoretical or numerical analysis . to this end",
    ", we need to obtain a formula for @xmath68 that holds for every positive real @xmath49 . in the appendix",
    "we show that for any @xmath83 the following identity holds for positive real non - integer @xmath21 @xmath84 and that when @xmath21 is positive integer @xmath85 is satisfied .",
    "it now follows from ( [ identity ] ) and ( [ rel2 ] ) that the @xmath56th generalized moment of @xmath48 for positive real non - integer @xmath21 can be written as @xmath86 when @xmath2 is integer , we obtain @xmath87 when @xmath28 , @xmath48 follows a weibull distribution and ( [ bwmom2 ] ) becomes @xmath88 which is precisely the @xmath56th moment of a weibull distribution with parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",

    "it can be observed from figures 3 and 4 that the skewness and kurtosis curves cross at @xmath29 , and from figures 5 and 6 that both skewness and kurtosis are independent of @xmath22 for @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the weibull distribution ( equivalent to bw for @xmath28 ) is represented by as single point on figures 3 - 6 .",

    "it may be worth noting from @xmath105 , that ( [ score4 ] ) yields @xmath106 which agrees with the previous calculations .    for interval estimation of @xmath107 and hypothesis tests , the fisher information matrix is required . for expressing the elements of this matrix",
    "it is convenient to introduce an extension of the integral ( [ sdba ] ) @xmath108 so that we have @xmath109 as before , let @xmath110 , where @xmath59 is a random variable following the beta@xmath60 distribution , then @xmath111 & = & \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x^{d-1 } ( \\log x)^e df_w(x)\\\\                          & = & \\frac{1}{b(a , b)}\\int_0^\\infty x^{d-1 } e^{bx } ( 1-e^{-x})^{a-1}(\\log x)^e dx\\\\                          & = & \\frac{t_{d , b , a , e}}{b(a , b)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the equation @xmath112,\\ ] ] relates @xmath113 to expected values .    to simplify the expressions for some elements of the information matrix , it is useful to note the identities @xmath114 and @xmath115    which can be easily proved .",

    "the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimates @xmath125 and @xmath126 is multivariate normal @xmath127 .",
    "the estimated multivariate normal @xmath128 distribution can be used to construct approximate confidence intervals and confidence regions for the individual parameters and for the hazard rate and survival functions .",
    "the asymptotic normality is also useful for testing goodness of fit of the bw distribution and for comparing this distribution with some of its special sub - models using one of the three well - known asymptotically equivalent test statistics - namely , the likelihood ratio ( lr ) statistic , wald and rao score statistics .",
    "we can compute the maximum values of the unrestricted and restricted log - likelihoods to construct the lr statistics for testing some sub - models of the bw distribution .",
    "for example , we may use the lr statistic to check if the fit using the bw distribution is statistically `` superior '' to a fit using the exponentiated weibull or weibull distributions for a given data set .",
    "mudholkar et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in their discussion of the classical bus - motor - failure data , noted the curious aspect in which the larger ew distribution provides an inferior fit as compared to the smaller weibull distribution .",
    "in this section we compare the results of fitting the bw and weibull distribution to the data set studied by meeker and escobar ( 1998 , p. 383 ) , which gives the times of failure and running times for a sample of devices from a field - tracking study of a larger system . at a certain point in time , 30 units were installed in normal service conditions .",
    "two causes of failure were observed for each unit that failed : the failure caused by an accumulation of randomly occurring damage from power - line voltage spikes during electric storms and failure caused by normal product wear .",
    "the times are : 275 , 13 , 147 , 23 , 181 , 30 , 65 , 10 , 300 , 173 , 106 , 300 , 300 , 212 , 300 , 300 , 300 , 2 , 261 , 293 , 88 , 247 , 28 , 143 , 300 , 23 , 300 , 80 , 245 , 266 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates and the maximized log - likelihood @xmath129 for the bw distribution are : @xmath130 while the maximum likelihood estimates and the maximized log - likelihood @xmath131 for the weibull distribution are : @xmath132    the likelihood ratio statistic for testing the hypothesis @xmath28 ( namely , weibull versus bw distribution ) is then @xmath133 , which indicates that the weibull distribution should be rejected . as an alternative test we use the wald statistic .",
    "the asymptotic covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimates for the bw distribution , which comes from the inverse of the information matrix , is given by @xmath134 the resulting wald statistic is found to be @xmath135 , again signalizing that the bw distribution conform to the above data . in figure 7",
    "we display the pdf of both weibull and bw distributions fitted and the data set , where it is seen that the bw model captures the aparent bimodality of the data .     the probability density function ( [ bwpdf ] ) of the fitted bw and weibull distributions , width=480 ]",
    "the weibull distribution , having exponential and rayleigh as special cases , is a very popular distribution for modeling lifetime data and for modeling phenomenon with monotone failure rates .",
    "in fact , the bw distribution represents a generalization of several distributions previously considered in the literature such as the exponentiated weibull distribution ( mudholkar et al . , 1995 ,",
    "mudholkar and hutson , 1996 , nassar and eissa , 2003 , nadarajah and gupta , 2005 and choudhury , 2005 ) obtained when @xmath27 .",
    "the weibull distribution ( with parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) is also another particular case for @xmath29 and @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath29 , the bw distribution reduces to a weibull distribution with parameters @xmath30 and @xmath12 .",
    "the beta exponential distribution is also an important special case for @xmath31 .",
    "the bw distribution provides a rather general and flexible framework for statistical analysis .",
    "it unifies several previously proposed families of distributions , therefore yielding a general overview of these families for theoretical studies , and it also provides a rather flexible mechanism for fitting a wide spectrum of real world data sets .",
    "we derive explicit expressions for the moments of the bw distribution , including an expansion for the moment generating function .",
    "these expressions are manageable and with the use of modern computer resources with analytic and numerical capabilities , may turn into adequate tools comprising the arsenal of applied statisticians .",
