    "<S> the effective - field - theory approach incorporates everything we already know about nature at high energy , and allows us to entertain the possibility of new physics without disrupting what has already been established .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of papers have advocated the use of effective field theory for top quark physics @xcite . </S>",
