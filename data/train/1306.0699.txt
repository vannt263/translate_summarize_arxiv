    "among the many possibilities for coherent manipulation of quantum systems , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is one of the most widely used and studied @xcite . this technique transfers population adiabatically between two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a three - state quantum system , without populating the intermediate state @xmath2 even when the time - delayed driving fields are on exact resonance with the respective pump and stokes transitions .",
    "the technique of stirap relies on the existence of a dark state , which is a time - dependent coherent superposition of the initial and target states only , and which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian if states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are on two - photon resonance . because stirap is an adiabatic technique , it is robust to variations in most of the experimental parameters .    in the early applications of stirap in atomic and molecular physics its efficiency , most often in the range 90 - 95% , has barely been scrutinized because such an accuracy suffices for most purposes . because stirap is resilient to decoherence linked to the intermediate state ( which is often an excited state ) this technique has quickly attracted attention as a promising control tool for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the latter , however , demands very high fidelity of operations , with the admissible error at most @xmath3 , which is hard to achieve with the standard stirap because , due to its adiabatic nature , it approaches unit efficiency only asymptotically , as the temporal pulse areas increase . for usual pulse shapes , e.g. , gaussian ,",
    "the necessary area for the @xmath3 benchmark is so large that it may break various restrictions in a real experiment .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to optimize stirap in order to achieve such an accuracy . because the loss of efficiency in stirap derives from incomplete adiabaticity , unanyan _",
    "@xcite , and later chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , have proposed to annul the nonadiabatic coupling by adding a third pulsed field on the transition @xmath4 . however",
    ", this field must coincide in time with the nonadiabatic coupling exactly ; its pulse area , in particular , must equal @xmath5 , which makes the pump and stokes fields largely redundant .",
    "an alternative approach to improve adiabaticity is based on the dykhne - davis - pechukas formula @xcite , which dictates that nonadiabatic losses are minimized when the eigenenergies of the hamiltonian are parallel .",
    "this approach , however , prescribes a strict time dependences for the pump and stokes pulse shapes @xcite , or for both the pulse shapes and the detunings @xcite .",
    "another basic approach to robust population transfer , which is an alternative to adiabatic techniques , is the technique of composite pulses , which is widely used in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and more recently , in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "this technique , implemented mainly in two - state systems , replaces the single pulse used traditionally for driving a two - state transition by a sequence of pulses with appropriately chosen phases ; these phases are used as a control tool for shaping the excitation profile in a desired manner , e.g. , to make it more robust to variations in the experimental parameters  intensities and frequencies .",
    "recently , we have proposed a hybrid technique  composite adiabatic passage ( cap )  which combines the techniques of composite pulses and adiabatic passage via a level crossing in a two - state system @xcite .",
    "cap can deliver extremely high fidelity of population transfer , far beyond the quantum computing benchmark , and far beyond what can be achieved with a single frequency - chirped pulse .",
    "recently , the cap technique has been demonstrated experimentally in a doped solid @xcite .     to state @xmath1 via a sequence of pump - stokes pulse pairs . on one - photon resonance ( top ) , the order of the pump and stokes pulses is reversed from pair to pair , while off single - photon resonance it is the same for all pulse pairs . ]    in this paper , we combine the two basic techniques  of composite pulses and stirap  into a hybrid technique , which we name _",
    "composite stirap_. this technique , which represents a sequence of an odd number of forward and backward ordinary stiraps , @xmath6 , adds to stirap the very high fidelity of composite pulses .",
    "each individual stirap can be very inaccurate , the affordable error being as much as 20 - 30% , but all errors interfere destructively and cancel in the end , thereby producing population transfer with a cumulative error far below the quantum computing benchmark of @xmath3 .",
    "we derive an analytical formula for the composite phases , applicable to an arbitrary odd number of pulse pairs @xmath7 ; the phases do not depend on the shape of the pulses and their mutual delay .",
    "the dynamics of a three - state @xmath8 system ( fig .",
    "[ tog ] ) is described by the schrdinger equation , [ schr ] i_t ( t ) = ( t)(t ) , where the vector @xmath9^t$ ] contains the three probability amplitudes .",
    "the hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation and on two - photon resonance between states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is [ h ] ( t ) = 2 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the rabi frequencies of the pump and stokes fields , @xmath12 is the one - photon detuning between each laser carrier frequency and the bohr frequency of the corresponding transition , and @xmath13 is the population loss rate from state @xmath2 ; we assume @xmath14 .",
    "states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled by @xmath10 , while states @xmath2 and @xmath1 are coupled by @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the system is described by the propagator @xmath15 , which connects the amplitudes at the initial and final times , @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "the mathematics is substantially different when the pump and stokes fields are on resonance or far off - resonance with the corresponding transition : therefore we consider these cases separately .",
    "first , we will consider the one - photon resonance , @xmath19 . then there is a mapping between the three - state problem and a corresponding two - state problem described by the hamiltonian ( t ) = 2 .",
    "( in this correspondence , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are assumed real . ) in general , if the two - state propagator is parameterized in terms of the complex cayley - klein parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) as = , we can write the propagator of stirap as [ u - ab ] = .",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are reflections of each other , @xmath23 [ e.g. , if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are identical symmetric functions of time ] , where @xmath26 is the pulse delay , then it is easily shown that @xmath27 .",
    "we use this property to parameterize the stirap propagator as @xmath28 in the adiabatic limit , @xmath29 ; hence @xmath30 .",
    ".pump and stokes phases for different number of pulse pairs @xmath7 for resonant composite stirap . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fidelity of the nonresonant composite stirap is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ c - stirap ] ( bottom frames ) and fig .  [ contoffres ] .",
    "again , composite stirap greatly outperforms single stirap in terms of fidelity and robustness .     as a function of the pulse delay and the peak rabi frequency for a single off - resonant stirap ( top ) and a sequence of five stiraps ( bottom ) , with phases given by eq .  , for @xmath31 pulse shapes , eqs .  .",
    "the detuning is @xmath32 . ]",
    "composite stirap may be affected by several sources of errors . in the first place ,",
    "errors in the composite phases should be held low in order to keep the high fidelity .",
    "we found that an error below 1% in the phases , which is relatively easy to achieve in the lab , can be tolerated . in fig .",
    "[ c - stirap ] we have added a curve , which demonstrates the fidelity of composite stirap for @xmath33 and a standard deviation of 0.01 radians in the composite phases ; despite this error , the technique still has ultrahigh fidelity , with an error below @xmath3 .",
    "stirap owes much of its great popularity to the fact that it can operate , unlike other techniques , in the presence of population losses from the middle state @xmath2 .",
    "however , when ultrahigh fidelity is aimed the presence of such losses can reduce the fidelity and they can not be very large .",
    "( the decay can be harmful only in the resonant case , while off - resonant composite stirap is much more resilient to them . )",
    "we have found that in the resonant case , if the decay rate is sufficiently low , or if the pulse duration is sufficiently short ( @xmath34 ) , composite stirap still maintains high fidelity and outperforms the standard stirap , as seen in fig .",
    "[ decay ] . as @xmath13 increases above @xmath35 , stirap behaves better but the fidelities of both stirap and composite stirap drop rapidly and are inadequate for quantum computing purposes .",
    "the presence of losses can be compensated with higher rabi frequency ; as a rough estimate the scaling law @xmath36 applies .",
    "it is also important to note that in the presence of decay the pulse pairs should be as close to each other as possible , as in the inset of fig .",
    "[ decay ] .",
    "this is readily achieved with microsecond and nanosecond pulses , e.g. , produced by acoustooptic modulators , as has been demonstrated recently in a doped - solid experiment @xcite .",
    "because composite stirap involves @xmath7 pulse pairs , its duration is longer than stirap by the same factor , given that there are no gaps between the pulse pairs , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ decay ] . in return",
    ", composite stirap gives a fidelity which can not be achieved with ordinary stirap , even with the much higher pulse areas .",
    "thus the main advantage of composite stirap over ordinary stirap is the ultrahigh fidelity .",
    "the main advantage of composite stirap over other variations of stirap , which provide `` shortcuts '' to adiabaticity by eliminating or reducing the nonadiabatic coupling @xcite is the simplicity of implementation , which requires just the control of the relative phases between the pulse pairs , and the preserved robustness of stirap with respect to variations in the interaction parameters .",
    "the `` shortcuts '' techniques use less pulse area , and therefore are faster than composite stirap ( although still slower than resonant techniques which use areas of just @xmath37 @xcite ) , but they give away most of the robustness of stirap by imposing strict restrictions on the pulse shapes , and some of them on the detunings too ; some of them even place considerable transient population in the intermediate state .",
    "pulse shapes with @xmath38 and @xmath19 . ]",
    "the hybrid technique proposed here combines two popular methods for manipulation of quantum systems  stirap and composite pulses .",
    "it greatly outperforms the standard stirap in terms of fidelity due to cancelation of the nonadiabatic errors by destructive interference .",
    "the greatly enhanced fidelity , well beyond the quantum computing benchmark , while preserving stirap s robustness against variations in the interaction parameters , makes composite stirap a promising technique for quantum information processing .",
