    "an elastic capsule consists of an elastic membrane enclosing a fluid phase .",
    "elastic capsules are commonly met in nature , prominent examples are red blood cells or virus capsules .",
    "artificial capsules can be fabricated by various methods @xcite , for example by interfacial polymerization at liquid droplets @xcite or by multilayer deposition of polyelectrolytes @xcite , and have numerous applications .",
    "sizes of capsules vary from the nanometer to the micrometer regime , and their mechanical properties depend on the fabrication process . for various applications , for example , if capsules are used as delivery and release systems , there is a need to characterize mechanical properties of capsules .",
    "the shape of capsules is approximately spherical but capsules are easily deformed by shear flow @xcite , rotation @xcite , in adhesion @xcite , or by the application of local forces @xcite .",
    "their deformation behavior also exhibits buckling instabilities upon decreasing the interior pressure or the enclosed volume @xcite or in adhesion @xcite .",
    "all these deformation modes can potentially be used in experiments to infer material properties of capsules .",
    "changes of the pressure inside the capsule by osmosis or mechanical means and changes in the capsule volume represent the most basic deformation mechanisms for capsules with spherical rest shape . in this article",
    ", we study the collapse of a three - dimensional spherical capsule via the buckling instability into a fully collapsed state under negative pressure or for reduced capsule volume .",
    "the mechanical buckling instability sets in at the classical buckling pressure , which is well - known within linear shell theory for small displacements and an isotropic material @xcite and has recently been extended to shell materials with anisotropic shear response @xcite . the classical buckling pressure @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is young s modulus , @xmath2 the initial membrane thickness and @xmath3 its initial diameter , can be used in experiments to determine young s modulus of the capsule material @xcite .    while the classical buckling pressure only marks the onset of the instability within linear shell theory and , thus , the limits of stability of a spherical capsule , it is much more difficult to calculate buckled shapes beyond the critical buckling pressure because larger deformations require nonlinear theories and contact between originally opposite capsule sides has to be included in order to prevent self - intersections .",
    "some nonlinear theories have been applied to compute axisymmetric shapes with large deformations , for example in @xcite under the assumption of isotropic tensions and for a more general case in @xcite .",
    "large buckling deformations have been considered numerically based on triangulated surface models @xcite . in the framework of shell theory , however , a complete picture of the transition into buckled shapes as observed in the experiments is still lacking .    in order to develop this picture for axisymmetric capsules",
    ", we use a nonlinear shell theory @xcite and assume hyperelastic capsule membranes . for hyperelastic materials , a strain - energy function exists from which the tensions and bending moments can be deduced . it can be shown in general that solutions of the equations of force and moment equilibrium render the functional of total energy stationary @xcite .",
    "this allows us to combine two tools , force equilibrium and principle of minimal energy , in order to find different branches of stationary deformed capsule shapes and then determine which capsule shape among different branches represents the global energy minimum . at the classical buckling instability the branch corresponding to a",
    "spherical capsule loses stability and a bifurcation to buckled shapes takes place .",
    "this bifurcation is analyzed in detail beyond a linear stability analysis and in energy ( and enthalpy ) bifurcation diagrams .",
    "we find that the buckling transition is discontinuous in the energy diagrams and that the buckled shape becomes _ energetically _ favorable already at a smaller negative pressure @xmath4 than the classical buckling pressure , where the spherical shape becomes mechanically unstable .",
    "we extend our approach to capsules with opposite sides in contact in order to prevent self - intersection at strongly reduced capsule volume . as far as we know ,",
    "this has so far only been achieved for elastic rings @xcite in two dimensions , but not for spherical shells in three dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we analyze features of buckled shapes , in particular , the maximal curvature occurring at the edge of the indentation rim and find a relation between the maximal curvatures and the bending modulus , which can be used in experimental shape analysis .",
    "we consider axisymmetric capsules , which are undergoing axisymmetric , torsionless deformations and whose membrane thickness is small compared to the other capsule dimensions .",
    "the midsurface of the undeformed capsule is parameterized by the curvilinear coordinates @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 denoting the arc length measured along the meridian and the angle of revolution , respectively .",
    "its shape is determined by the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 in cylindrical polar coordinates ( see figure [ fig : midsurface ] ) .",
    "in addition to the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the slope angle @xmath9 is defined via the relations ( see figure [ fig : midsurface ] ) @xmath10 using this parameterization we calculate the _ principal curvatures _ of the midsurface , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 denotes the curvature in the meridional direction , and @xmath13 the curvature in the circumferential direction .",
    "for the special case of capsules with spherical resting shape , the parameterization of the undeformed midsurface is known analytically , @xmath14 , \\label{eq : undef1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the arc length @xmath15 ranges up to @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , the slope angle and curvatures are given by @xmath17 respectively .",
    "all quantities introduced so far in this section carry the index `` @xmath18 '' because they refer to the undeformed capsule configuration .",
    "the midsurface of the deformed configuration is parameterized using analogous quantities without indices `` @xmath18 '' .",
    "specifically , its shape is determined by the sought - after functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the redundant @xmath21 .",
    "these functions have to satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , corresponding to a closed capsule without kinks at its poles . the geometrical relations ( [ eq : geom1 ] ) and ( [ eq : geom2 ] ) can be transferred directly to the deformed midsurface by omitting all indices `` @xmath18 '' .",
    "having defined the parameterization of the deformed and undeformed midsurface , we can now introduce measures of deformation .",
    "fibers oriented along the meridional and circumferential direction get stretched by the factors @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the function @xmath26 defined in this context describes the position @xmath27 at which a particle can be found that was originally located at @xmath15 . in order to center the measures of stretch around zero ,",
    "we define the _ meridional and circumferential strains _ @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the bending of the midsurface is measured by the _ meridional and circumferential bending strains _ @xmath30 they are more suitable than a simple difference of deformed and undeformed curvature because they lead to more simple constitutive equations , as we will see below .",
    "the strains measured by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 give rise to elastic tensions and bending moments in the capsule membrane .",
    "assuming that the capsule membrane consists of an hyperelastic material , there exists a _ surface energy density _ @xmath35 , which measures the elastic energy that is stored in an infinitesimal patch of the membrane divided by the area that this patch takes in the _ undeformed _ configuration .",
    "in this paper , we will use a hookean model @xcite @xmath36 with a ( three - dimensional ) young modulus @xmath1 , a bending modulus @xmath37 , and a poisson ratio @xmath38 , for a shell of ( homogeneous ) thickness @xmath2 . note that the poisson ratio of a two - dimensional membrane can take values @xmath39 , with @xmath40 corresponding to an area - incompressible membrane .",
    "the product @xmath41 is frequently called the surface young modulus . in classical small strain theory of plates ,",
    "the bending modulus can be expressed as @xmath42 the bending energy contribution in the elastic energy ( [ elastic_energy ] ) agrees to leading order in @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and for an incompressible membrane with @xmath40 with the commonly used helfrich bending energy @xmath45 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) with a spontaneous curvature @xmath46 .",
    "the helfrich bending energy was originally proposed for two - dimensional liquids like vesicles , which differ qualitatively from the solid shells we are considering .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the _ meridional tension _ @xmath47 and _ bending moment _ @xmath48 derive from the surface energy density via @xmath49 likewise , we obtain the _ circumferential tension _ @xmath50 and _ bending moment",
    "_ @xmath51 by analogous formulae with indices @xmath52 and @xmath27 interchanged .",
    "tensions and bending moments are measured per unit length of the _ deformed _ capsule , which is the reason why prefactors @xmath53 appear in these constitutive equations .",
    "figure [ fig : tensions ] shows on which faces of a membrane patch the tensions and bending moments act . figure [ fig : tensions ] also shows an additional _ transverse shear tension _ @xmath54 which acts on the top ( and bottom ) side of the patch .",
    "it is constitutively undefined in our model because we did not incorporate deformations in which the capsule s cross section gets sheared ( i.e.  fibers normal to the midsurface get rotated ) .",
    "however , the transverse shear tension is necessary to achieve force and moment equilibrium .",
    "note that there does not act any transverse shear tension on the right side of the patch because of the assumption of axisymmetric , torsionless deformation .",
    "besides the geometric relations and constitutive equations presented so far , conditions of force and moment equilibrium are needed to close the problem . these are three differential equations for tangential and normal force equilibrium and moment equilibrium , which take the form @xcite @xmath55 in the absence of external tangential force and torque densities and for a constant pressure @xmath56 inside the capsule .",
    "another approach to find stable configurations of capsules for fixed but altered volume @xmath57 is to minimize the functional of stored elastic energy @xmath58 by calculus of variations .",
    "the constraint of fixed capsule volume @xmath59 is handled by introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath56 and extremizing the enthalpy @xmath60 instead .",
    "the principle of stationary total energy @xcite states that the solutions of the equilibrium conditions ( [ eq : equil1 ] ) to ( [ eq : equil3 ] ) with given pressure @xmath56 render the enthalpy @xmath61 stationary .    in the case at hand",
    ", this can be verified by using the standard procedure of calculus of variations . using @xmath62 for the area element of the undeformed midsurface and @xmath63 as an integral expression for the capsule volume , we arrive at the enthalpy @xmath64 for which we have to find stationary points .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are derived in appendix [ appendix_variation ] and turn out to be @xmath65 they coincide with the general equations of tangential force and moment equilibrium ( [ eq : equil1 ] ) and ( [ eq : equil3 ] ) , but the normal force equilibrium equation ( [ eq : equil2 ] ) is replaced by the algebraic expression ( [ eq : sphere_q ] ) for @xmath54 . instead of three differential equations in the general case",
    ", we now end up with only two differential equations and one algebraic relation .",
    "this means we have found a _ first integral _ of the general equations of equilibrium ( which is only valid for capsules with spherical resting shape under uniform pressure ) . inserting the algebraic expression ( [ eq : sphere_q ] ) into the differential equation ( [ eq : equil2 ] ) for @xmath54",
    "confirms that the solution found here satisfies the general equations of force equilibrium .       and",
    "@xmath66 are marked.,width=245 ]    among the solutions for negative pressure , unphysical solutions that exhibit self - intersection can occur . for two - dimensional shells with circular resting shape ( cylinder , ring ) , flaherty _",
    "et  al . _",
    "addressed this problem in @xcite .",
    "they found that the opposite sides of an elastic ring touch at one point when the negative pressure reaches a certain threshold @xmath67 . lowering the pressure further",
    ", the curvature at the point of contact decreases until it finally becomes zero at a second critical pressure @xmath68 . for pressures lower than @xmath68 ,",
    "the contact area is a straight - line segment , which increases in length with decreasing pressure .    in order to generalize these results to three - dimensional spherical shells",
    ", we make the ansatz of a top / down symmetric deformed configuration with flat circular areas around the poles in contact with each other , see figure [ fig : area_contact ] . considering only top / down symmetric solutions ,",
    "it is sufficient to set up the energy functional for the lower hemisphere only . the flat part with @xmath69 , is referred to as part i , and the remaining part with @xmath70 as part ii .",
    "in order to treat variations with respect to the boundary @xmath71 between parts i and ii properly , the enthalpy functional is split up into two corresponding parts @xmath72 where the volume constraint and the condition @xmath73 are already incorporated via the lagrange multipliers @xmath56 and @xmath74 .",
    "performing the first variation involves the following problems : in part i , the function @xmath75 must be varied , and in part ii the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "additionally , the integral boundary @xmath71 must be varied , which yields continuity conditions at @xmath77 .",

    "the euler - lagrange equations for part ii are very similar to those obtained above for non - intersecting shapes , except for the term @xmath81 in the algebraic expression for @xmath82 .",
    "nevertheless , it can be easily shown that relation ( [ eq : sphere_area_q ] ) also satisfies the general equation ( [ eq : equil2 ] ) , although it differs from the previous solution by the additional term with the lagrange multiplier @xmath74 .    in order to fit the solutions of part i and ii together ,",
    "continuity conditions must be derived , which arise from the variation with respect to the integral boundary @xmath71 .",
    "it turns out that most quantities of interest are continuous at @xmath77 , namely @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 where an index @xmath90 stands for @xmath27 or @xmath52 . only for the transverse shear tension @xmath54",
    "no continuity condition derives because of the lack of a constitutive relation between the shear tension @xmath54 and elastic deformations in the present formulation .",
    "we just know that the value @xmath91 depends via the algebraic relation ( [ eq : sphere_area_q ] ) on the lagrange multiplier @xmath74 .",
    "the shape of the deformed capsule is governed by the equilibrium conditions , constitutive equations and geometric relations presented above .",

    "the change of variables from @xmath27 to @xmath15 was accomplished by the relation @xmath93 , see ( [ eq : def_lambda ] ) .",
    "usage of the algebraic expression ( [ eq : sphere_q ] ) would reduce this system by one equation , but turns out to be numerically impractical because of singularities when @xmath85 approaches @xmath94 .    in order to close the above system of shape equations , all functions appearing on the right hand side",
    "must be expressed in terms of the basic functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath54 . exploiting geometrical relations , the definitions of the strains and the constitutive equations",
    ", we find the set of relations @xmath95 which close the system ( [ eq : shape_hoo_shell ] ) .    after changing variables from @xmath27 to @xmath15 , the boundary conditions for a closed capsule without kinks at its poles are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , while the spherical reference shape satisfies ( [ eq : undef1 ] ) and ( [ eq : undef2 ] ) .",

    "this criterion has experimental significance if the capsule volume can not change because the encapsulated liquid is incompressible and the membrane is impermeable . in cases of a semipermeable capsule membrane , it is also reasonable to consider the volume fixed because the relaxation into the equilibrium shape happens on much shorter time scales than the diffusion of the inner liquid through the membrane . in the corresponding bifurcation diagram",
    "we display the stored elastic energy @xmath170 as a function of the volume @xmath59 .    on the other hand ,",

    "solution branches that lie lowest in the @xmath173 bifurcation diagrams need not necessarily coincide with the lowest branches in the @xmath172 diagrams .    finally , it is also useful to analyze the relation between pressure @xmath56 and volume @xmath59 for stationary capsule shapes .",
    "branches that exhibit an unusual pressure - volume relation with @xmath175 are inherently unstable if the pressure is given instead of the volume @xcite . to see that",

    "now , if we try to change the capsule volume by lowering the pressure by an amount @xmath176 , the capsule grows by an amount @xmath177 , i.e.  water flows from the reservoir into the capsule .",
    "the loss of water in the reservoir typically leads to an even lower pressure and thus , the equilibrium is unstable with repsect to volume changes .",
    "this instability is also reflected by a negative second derivative of the free energy , @xmath178 and a horizontal @xmath179 curve with @xmath180 marks the onset of such an instability .",

    "also configurations with opposite sides in contact could be computed and incorporated in the bifurcation diagrams ; fully buckled configurations with opposite sides in contact ( branch @xmath193 in the bifurcation diagrams ) actually have the lowest energies at small volumes or low negative pressures and determine the critical pressure @xmath192 .    for buckled shapes , the maximal curvature @xmath194 at the edge of inward buckled dimples was found to depend depend strongly on the ratio of bending resistance to surface young modulus , with smaller ratios leading to sharper bends .",
    "a power law @xmath195 was found for sufficiently small bending resistances and sufficiently small volume changes .",
    "this relation may be used to analyze experimental shapes of buckled elastic capsules and extract the bending modulus of the capsule membrane from the capsule shape .",
