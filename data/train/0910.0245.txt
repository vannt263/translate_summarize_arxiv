    "over the past decade or more , the formation histories and clustering properties of dark matter halos , within a lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) cosmology , have been studied in detail using both numerical simulations and analytical analyses .",

    "furthermore , recent dark matter simulations indicate that the clustering of halos of a given mass depends on their assembly history , where halos that assembled their mass earlier in the history of the universe are more strongly clustered than halos of the same mass that formed later @xcite ; this effect is commonly referred to as assembly bias @xcite .",
    "the concept of assembly bias could be applicable to the formation of galaxies in addition to dark matter halos , such that galaxies that assembled their stellar mass earlier would be more strongly clustered today than galaxies of like mass and younger stellar populations .",
    "such a bias in the galaxy population has typically been explored in two distinct manners : [ 1 ] by studying galaxy samples spanning a range of redshifts and directly observing the evolution in the population as a function of mass and clustering properties , and [ 2 ] by applying a more archaeological or paleontological approach , where the stellar populations of nearby galaxies are studied in detail , with the goal of disentangling the typical evolutionary history in different environments .",
    "various observational studies have investigated the formation of early  type or red  sequence galaxies from both perspectives .",
    "for instance , analyses of samples drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite by @xcite and by @xcite showed that the population of galaxies on the red sequence at @xmath1 was preferentially built  up in overdense environments , so that at a given mass red galaxies in dense environs have typically ceased their star formation ( i.e. , assembled their mass ) earlier than those in less dense regions .",

    "in contrast to the relatively coherent picture derived from studies of early  type or red  sequence galaxies at intermediate redshift , detailed studies of the stellar populations in nearby ellipticals have yielded mixed results .",
    "a recent comparison of the stellar ages of early  type systems in the coma cluster versus a corresponding field sample by @xcite found no difference in assembly history between the two environment regimes . on the other hand",
    ", a similar analysis of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in the virgo and coma clusters by @xcite found a distinct relationship between mean stellar age and the environment in which a galaxy resides , such that cluster early  types are older than their field counterparts .    in this paper",
    ", we take a different approach towards studying the topic of assembly bias , with hopes of reconciling the results from studies at intermediate  redshift with those focusing on local samples .",
    "many previous efforts at low redshift relied on comparing cluster and field populations and/or focused on high  quality observations of a relatively small number of galaxies and/or partially controlled for morphology while ignoring inter ",

    "however , a recent analysis of the relationship between environment and the luminosities , rest  frame colors , stellar masses , and gas  phase metallicities of nearby star  forming galaxies selected from the sdss by @xcite shows that after removing the mean dependence of environment on color and luminosity there remains a highly  significant correlation between environment and oxygen abundance . that is",

    "in contrast to other studies of the relationship between environment and stellar age or metallicity for early  type galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , for many previous studies of local early  type galaxies , it is likely that the same errors or limitations that smeared out the age  density relation in the galaxy sample also precipitated a non  detection of the metallicity  density relation .",
    "in contrast to our results and to the majority of results from the aforementioned studies of local early  type galaxies , ( * ? ? ?",

    "this discrepancy between the findings of @xcite and those of our work ( as well as those of @xcite , @xcite , among others ) can potentially be understood in terms of an age  metallicity degeneracy . as discussed in more detail in  [ sec_degen ] , errors in estimating stellar age are strongly correlated with errors in metallicity , such that if a galaxy s age is overestimated , then its metallicity will correspondingly be underestimated .",
    "thus , the metallicity  density relation reported by @xcite could be reconciled with other observations , if the @xcite age  density relation is correspondingly stronger than that found in other analyses .",
    "the plausibility of this scenario is supported by the larger difference in age between massive ellipticals in field and cluster environments given by ( * ? ? ? * @xmath143@xmath144 gyr ) versus that found by ( * ? ? ? * @xmath145 gyr ) .",
    "the analysis by @xcite suffers even more from the problem of small sample size ( @xmath146 galaxies in total ) .",

    "however , the @xcite study compared the ages of galaxies in different environments at fixed @xmath147band absolute magnitude and not at fixed mass ( i.e. , not at fixed stellar mass or velocity dispersion ) . thus , their field sample may have been increasingly dominated by younger galaxies at lower masses , which appeared bright in the @xmath147band due to recent star  formation activity .",

    "* ) , it might be expected that an age ",
    "density relation at fixed mass would naturally be accompanied by some sort of metallicity  density relation , like that observed by @xcite .",
    "however , there is large scatter in the age  metallicity relation , especially at lower masses .",
    "furthermore , stellar age and metallicity measure different aspects of a galaxy s formation history ; while age traces the time since the bulk of the stars were formed ( or in the case of luminosity  weighted mean stellar age , the time since the last significant episode of star formation ) , metallicity reflects the balance of feedback and accretion processes in concert with the star  formation efficiency ( that is , the efficiency with which gas is turned into stars ) . for example , two galaxies forming from pristine gas reservoirs and following identical formation histories , except for an offset in time , will contain stellar populations of comparable metallicity , but distinct ages .",
    "our results suggest that not only did red  sequence galaxies in high  density environments form earlier than their counterparts in low  density regions , but [ 1 ] feedback and/or accretion processes are modulated by the local environment such that the high  density regime favors greater metal abundances and/or [ 2 ] the typical star  formation efficiency of galaxies in high  density regions or at higher redshift exceeds that of galaxies in low  density environs or at lower redshift .",
    "some evidence for the former scenario has been observed in a study of star  forming galaxies at @xmath148 by @xcite . using the gas  phase oxygen abundance measurements of @xcite , they show that local environment is correlated with a non  negligible portion of the scatter in the mass  metallicity relation , such that galaxies in higher  density environs at a given mass tend to be more metal  rich . as discussed in more detail by @xcite , there are many physical scenarios that might lead to galaxies having a higher metal abundance in high  density regions versus in low  density regions .",
    "for example , processes such as ram  pressure stripping or galaxy harassment @xcite , which only operate in extreme high  density environs , could remove the outer portion ( i.e. , the most metal  poor portion ) of a galaxy s gaseous halo , thereby inflating the relative metal abundance of gas reservoirs within galaxies in rich groups and clusters .",
    "similarly , outflows and winds driven from galaxies in high  density environments might be less capable of expelling enriched gas versus their counterparts in underdense regions .",
    "there is also evidence to support the possible higher star ",
    "formation efficiencies of star  forming galaxies at higher redshift relative to local star - forming galaxies .",
    "for example , studies of sub  millimeter galaxies ( smgs , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath149 typically find higher surface densities of star formation for a given surface density of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "such a correlation between star  formation efficiency and redshift in concert with a galaxy assembly bias where galaxies in high  density environs formed their stars earlier ( i.e. , at higher redshift ) than their counterparts in low ",
    "density environs would yield a corresponding correlation between environment and star  formation efficiency such that galaxies in overdense regions are more efficient at converting gas into stars ( i.e. , have higher stellar metallicity ) .",
    "the stellar populations of galaxies are not entirely formed via in  situ star formation .",
    "rather , much of a galaxy s stellar mass is assembled via accretion events ( i.e. , mergers ) .",
    "in addition to increasing the stellar mass of a galaxy , mergers can also have a substantial impact on the age of the resulting system . while gas ",
    "rich ( or `` wet '' ) mergers will tend to induce bursts of star formation thereby significantly decreasing the inferred luminosity  weighted mean stellar age of the system , dissipationless ( or `` dry '' ) merging of two systems with older stellar populations will have a less severe impact on the inferred age of the merger product , yielding a passively  evolving descendant with a stellar age that is simply the luminosity  weighted average of the antecedents ages .",
    "in addition , mergers tend to occur in regions of higher galaxy density , such as galaxy groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given this correlation with environment , it is important to understand the potential impact of hierarchical assembly on our results . since mergers increase the stellar mass of the system and since galaxies with smaller stellar masses tend to have younger stellar populations ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxies that have recently undergone a merger are likely to be biased towards lower ages relative to other galaxies of like stellar mass . in the case of gas  rich mergers , this effect is further accentuated by the decrease in age associated with the merger  induced burst of star formation .",
    "thus , mergers would tend to decrease the average age of galaxies at a given stellar mass in the high  density regime , thereby decreasing the amplitude of the observed age ",
    "density relation at fixed mass . in all , the impact of mergers would be to smear out the residual age  density relation shown in figure [ resid_fig ] .",

    "the time since quenching ( or time since assembly  thus , stellar age ) for a galaxy on the red sequence is naturally correlated with the local galaxy density or environment .",
    "our results support this potential explanation for the evolution of the environment distribution of post  starburst galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "the observed correlation between stellar age and environment at fixed stellar mass supports ( although does not prove ) the picture in which k+a galaxies are found in the same type of environment at @xmath1 .      the typical age of a stellar population has been shown to be strongly connected to the type ia supernova ( sn ) rate , with young star  forming galaxies having much higher sn ia rates than quiescent galaxies with older stellar populations @xcite . the increase in the sn ia rate with star ",
    "formation rate is commonly attributed to the existence of two types of ia events : `` prompt '' sne ia , which likely result from the evolution of somewhat massive stars and are thus correlated with star formation , and `` delayed '' sne ia , which are thought to be the evolutionary outcome of less massive stars and therefore connected to the underlying stellar mass of the galaxy .    within quiescent systems , the delayed component of the ia rate dominates . however , even for systems of like mass and lacking ongoing star formation , the sn ia rate is still expected to depend on the age of the stellar population ; some theoretical predictions for both single  degenerate and double  degenerate progenitor scenarios suggest that the sn ia rate for a single  aged stellar population should increase with time , reaching a peak around an age of @xmath154 yr , with a sharp decline towards later times @xcite .",
    "a more recent analysis by @xcite slightly revises this general picture , finding a sharp reduction in the type ia rate for both single  degenerate and double  degenerate progenitors beyond an age of @xmath145 gyr .    taking as given this theoretical connection between stellar age and type ia rate",
    ", our results regarding the correlation between age and environment at fixed stellar mass along the red sequence suggest that the type ia rate in early  type galaxies should vary with environment .",
    "in particular , our study indicates that the sn ia rate within quiescent early  type galaxies should be lower in high  density environs relative to that found in low  density environs .",
    "the bulk of our samples have typical luminosity  weighted mean stellar ages greater than @xmath94 gyr , placing these populations beyond the expected peak in the type ia rate and into a regime where the rate should be in sharp decline .    currently , the evidence is mixed regarding a potential correlation between the sn ia rate ( per unit mass ) and environment in the local universe .",
    "most notably , @xcite concluded that the type ia rate is more than 3 times higher in cluster ellipticals relative to field ellipticals , using a sample of 11 cluster and 5 field type ia events at @xmath155 , which would run counter to the theoretical trend .",
    "however , the uncertainty of these environment  dependent rates is quite large .",
    "in contrast , a recent analysis of a larger sample of type ia supernovae drawn from the sdss ",
    "ii supernova survey by @xcite found no significant relationship between local galaxy environment and the likelihood of hosting a type ia event within the red galaxy population .",
    "overall , such studies of the environments of type ia supernovae are currently limited by small numbers .",
    "results from future surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will hopefully help in answering such outstanding questions .",
    "using the measurements of luminosity  weighted mean stellar age and stellar metallicity from @xcite and the local galaxy overdensity estimates of @xcite , we study the relationship between galaxy properties and environment for various samples of galaxies on the red sequence . in contrast to previous studies in the local universe , we do not solely focus on the early  type galaxy population or on galaxies selected to reside in particular environments ( e.g. , specific clusters such as virgo or coma ) ; instead , we define various galaxy samples drawn from the sdss , controlling for correlations between environment and color , morphology , mass , etc . , while probing a broad and continuous range of environments .",
    "our principal results are as follows :    1 .   after removing the mean color ",

    "2 .   when using subsamples restricted according to morphological , brightness , and color criteria , we find this residual age  density relation persists with no significant change in strength ( cf .",
    "figure [ select_fig ] and table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   using stellar velocity dispersion to trace mass ( in lieu of stellar mass ) , we find that the age  density relation at fixed mass persists ( cf .",

    "we find a significant residual correlation between environment and stellar metallicity at fixed color and luminosity ( cf .",

    "figure [ select_fig ] and table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "our results are in conflict with the general conclusions of recent work by @xcite and @xcite , which both indicate a lack of correlation between age and environment at fixed mass .",

    "[ sec_intro ] , evidence for an assembly bias in the galaxy formation process has commonly been explored in two distinct manners : an evolutionary approach , which studies galaxies over a range of redshift and directly infers evolution in the galaxy properties , and an archaeological or paleontological approach , which studies the stellar populations of nearby galaxies in detail with the aim of deriving the evolutionary history from the current fossil record .",
    "as evidenced by the work presented herein , the results from these two methods are now arriving at a relatively consistent picture .",
    "studies of galaxies at @xmath1 have shown that the population of red ( or early  type ) galaxies was preferentially built  up in overdense environments , such that red  sequence galaxies in dense environments have generally assembled their stellar mass and developed elliptical morphologies earlier than those in less dense regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our results , which apply the aforementioned archaeological method , show a general agreement with these results from studies at higher redshifts , supporting a picture of assembly bias in the local galaxy population .",
    "we find that at a given mass on the red sequence galaxies with older stellar populations are found in more overdense environments ( i.e. , are more strongly clustered ) than their counterparts with younger stellar populations .",
    "in contrast to some previous studies , we find that this correlation between age and environment at fixed mass is _ not _ solely driven by a minority population of galaxies that have experienced recent episodes of star formation .",
    "we find a strong residual age  density relation even among those red  sequence galaxies dominated by older stellar populations ( i.e. , with ages @xmath157 gyr ) .    in the future",
