    "the problem of a quantum spin glass in a transverse field was recently in the center of theoretical and experimental interest @xcite .",
    "in particular the question of the interplay between glassy behavior and quantum fluctuations and the properties of the quantum transition at zero temperature were the subject of several investigations , both for the case of the infinite - ranged spin glass and more realistic three dimensional models .",
    "a simpler model which catches many of the essential features of the ( classical ) spin glass problem is that of a directed manifold in a random medium @xcite .",
    "an even higher simplification occurs for the case of a zero dimensional manifold , which is equivalent to a particle in a random potential ( which is localized by an additional fixed harmonic potential ) @xcite .",
    "this model has been found to require a ( infinite - step ) parisi type solution when the random potential has long range correlations @xcite . for a random potential with short ranged correlations",
    "a one - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) solution has been found@xcite .",
    "a single particle in one dimension does not have a sharp transition into a glassy phase .",
    "but in infinite dimensions it does .",
    "it turns out that the analytical solution which utilizes the variational approximation , still possess a sharp transition at finite dimensions ( including one dimension ) .",
    "this occurs since the replica symmetric ( rs ) is not able to capture the glassy features of the systems once they become strong enough , and gives rise to unphysical results , like a non - monotonic mean square displacement of the particle from the origin as a function of the temperature . below a certain temperature",
    "the rsb solution yields a much better physical result , and in particular the correct non - analytic behavior at @xmath0 as a function of the strength of the random potential in agreement with an imry - ma type argument @xcite .",
    "one should notice though , that the transition which has been found for a particle in a random potential is of the almeida - thouless type @xcite in the sense that it is associated with rs- rsb transition but not with an order - disorder ( spin - glass like ) transition .",
    "the success of the variational treatment of a classical particle in a random potential , led one of us recently @xcite to investigate a quantum analog , i.e. to turn on @xmath1 and consider the effect of quantum fluctuations , e.g. tunneling on the glassy behavior of the particle .",
    "this was suggested by the recent theoretical treatment of the quantum spin glass in a transverse field @xcite .",
    "analytically we have found a glassy phase characterized by rsb , which is destroyed by the quantum fluctuations for strong enough @xmath2 , or alternatively for small enough @xmath3 , which is the particle s mass .",
    "the variable @xmath4 plays the role of the transverse field in the quantum spin glass problem .",
    "a schematic phase diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "the full details of the analytical investigation are given in @xcite , to be referred in the sequel as i.    recently @xcite one of us used the model of a particle in two spatial dimensions under the influence of an harmonic and a quenched random potential to describe the melting transition of the flux lattice in high - temperature superconductors with columnar disorder .",
    "the so called cage model has been introduced originally by nelson and vinokur @xcite . in this model",
    "a single flux line is represented by the world line of a quantum particle .",
    "the influence of neighboring flux lines is taken effectively as the cage harmonic potential .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 is determined by the size of the system along the z - axis and the value of the temperature .",
    "this shows the usefulness of the toy - model to other physical systems of interest .",
    "our aim in this paper is two - fold .",
    "first we carried out a quantum monte carlo simulation of the system in one dimension in order to compare with the analytical results obtained in i for the mean square displacement .",
    "second , since both the random potential and the quantum fluctuations increase the mean square displacement , this quantity by itself is not enough to give a clear picture concerning the strength of the glassy behavior of the system .",
    "hence we have measured in the simulation , and also calculated analytically the sample to sample fluctuation of @xmath5 , which shows that the glassy behavior of the system diminishes as the quantum fluctuation increase until the eventual demise of the glassy phase for strong enough @xmath6 .",
    "this decline in the sample to sample fluctuations is a gradual effect , which analytically culminates in the transition from an rsb solution to a rs solution .",
    "as mentioned previously , in a simulation which is carried out in one dimension , we do not expect to observe any sharp transition .",
    "the trapping of the particle in deep local minima of the random potential gives rise to a sticky behavior- i.e. a freezing of the mean square displacement from the origin .",
    "this effect is countered by tunneling among the different minima which enables the particle to escape from a local minima and thus diminishes the glassy behavior .    in the next section",
    "we define the model . in section 3",
    "we review some of the results obtained in i and obtain a new analytic result for the sample to sample fluctuations of the mean square displacement of the particle from the origin . in sect .",
    "4 , we describe the details of the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a discussion of the results and a summary .",
    "a comparison is made between the simulation and the theoretical results obtained in i and in section 3 . in the appendix",
    "we give some further details of the calculation presented in section 3 .",
    "the partition function for a particle at finite temperature @xmath7 , subject to a harmonic potential and a random potential @xmath8 , is given by the functional integral @xcite : @xmath9\\ \\exp \\left\\ { -{\\frac 1% \\hbar } \\int_0^u\\left [ { \\frac{m\\dot { { \\bf x}}(u)^2}2}\\ + \\ { \\frac{\\mu { \\bf x}% ( u)^2}2}\\ + \\ v({\\bf x}(u))\\right ] du\\right\\ } ,   \\label{pf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a @xmath11-dimensional vector ( @xmath11 is the number of spatial dimensions ) , and @xmath12 .",
    "the variable @xmath13 has dimensions of time and is often referred to as the trotter dimension .",
    "we observe that the trajectory @xmath14 forms a closed path . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with a random quenched potential @xmath15 , which is gaussian distributed .",
    "this means that the probability for a given realization of the potential is given by : @xmath16 with some known function @xmath17 .",

    "the function @xmath19 describes the correlations of the random potential . in this paper",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "one , which we call the case of long ranged correlations of the potential , for which @xmath19 is taken to decay as a power at large distances : @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "this case corresponds in one dimension to an interface in the random field ising model @xcite @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 plays the role of a short - distance regulator for @xmath19 .",
    "another type of random potential we consider has gaussian correlations and we refer to it as the case of short - ranged correlations . for this case ,",
    "the function @xmath19 is taken to decay as a exponential function at large distances : @xmath24 in the classical case it has been shown that ( for @xmath25 ) even when correlations fall exponentially fast , the physics is equivalent within the variational approximation to the case of random potential with power law correlations @xmath26(eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) ) and @xmath27 at large distances @xcite .",
    "this fact also holds in the quantum case , as has been demonstrated in i. thus we will compare the results obtained in the qmc for the distribution ( [ f2 ] ) with results obtained in i for the case of @xmath28 .",
    "in paper i we investigated the problem using the replica method and the variational approximation . here",
    "we review briefly some of the formalism and discuss the new derivation of the sample to sample fluctuation of the mean square displacement that is a measure of the glassiness of the system and is needed to compare with the results of the qmc simulations .",

    "is similar to the classical boltzmann distribution of a polymer ring with @xmath68 beads under the influence of an applied harmonic potential and a random potential .",
    "the beads have a harmonic spring interaction between neighboring beads and in addition each bead feels a combination of a harmonic ( w.r.t the origin ) and a random local potentials .",
    "this gives us an intuitive picture of the simulation . in the simulation one",
    "attempts to move each bead in its own turn and one checks if the `` energy '' ( minus the argument of the exponential ) decreases or increases .",
    "then one actually moves the bead in accordance to a detailed balance algorithm , e.g. the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the problem in doing pimc comes from the fact that for small @xmath72 ( or large @xmath73 the beads are not easy to move due to a very large spring constant , thus the acceptance rate is low for a reasonable size move and convergence is not easy to achieve in a reasonable time . for this reason many efforts have been made to circumvent the problem @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",

    "the numbers range from 7 to 16 .",
    "although this is not a large number , results from simulations we carried for a simple harmonic oscillator give pretty small errors .",
    "this gives us confidence that in the presence of random potentials the small number of points in the trotter time dimension will also give us a small error in comparison with the statistical error which comes from the small number of samples of random potentials . since this is not a very large number of points we found it sufficient to include only the zeroth and first normal modes , i.e. we choose @xmath77 , and then decide whether they move or not .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath78 and the @xmath79 s are chosen so that the acceptance ratio is approximately 0.5 .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath80 , and the size of microscopic movement @xmath81 are listed in table 1 at the end of this section .",
    "we have generated two kinds of random potentials : a random potential with long range correlation , characterized by @xmath22 and a random potential with short range correlation which decay as a gaussian . within the framework of the variational approximation such",
    "a potential is equivalent to a random potential with power law correlations that are characterized by an index @xmath27 .    for the case of long range correlation",
    ", we have generated @xmath82 uncorrelated random numbers @xmath83 with a gaussian distribution .",
    "we then constructed the variables @xmath84 by :    @xmath85    and placed them on one dimensional lattice with a lattice constant chosen to be @xmath86 .",
    "the random potential generated in this way has correlation @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a constant independent of @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the free energy depends trivially on @xmath88 but @xmath91 is independent of @xmath88 as has been mentioned in equation ( 2 ) of ref@xcite . in this way a random potential with long range correlation is generated .",
    "these 6000 numbers have long ranged correlations with @xmath92    we now discuss the procedure to generate a random potential with short range correlations . from the fact that random potentials with correlation @xmath93 in configuration space have correlations in momentum space with the following form @xmath94 we generated random numbers with a proper distribution in momentum space and fast fourier transformed them by a standard fortran subroutine @xcite to get random numbers with a gaussian _",
    "correlation_. we put @xmath95 of them on lattice sites with a lattice constant of @xmath96 .",
    "these constitute a random potential with short ( gaussian ) correlations . in both long and short - ranged disorder ,",
    "we discretize the @xmath97 direction such that the lattice is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "another difficulty is that in the low temperature regime the relaxation time of the system is very long because the phase space of the system is separated by high free energy barriers and it is difficult to get reliable results within a reasonable computer time .",
    "the standard approach of doing a simulation in these systems is the simulated annealing approach , and in addition to using this method we also used a modified version of the global movement algorithm to speed up the dynamics .",
    "we started our simulation from the high temperature regime ( @xmath99 for long range correlation case and @xmath100 for short range correlaion case ) .",
    "we then lowered the temperature in steps of @xmath101 when @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath103 we lowered the temperature by @xmath104 at a time and performed thermal averages for every @xmath105 .",
    "the lowest temperature of our simulation was set to be @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , we attempted 2 different size ( zeroth mode ) global movements in each sweep , of magnitudes @xmath23 and @xmath106 respectively",
    ". generally we chose one of these parameters , say @xmath23 , to be much bigger than the other ( but such the acceptance rate will not fall below @xmath86 ) in order that the particle will get a chance to occasionally escape from deep wells which correspond to metastable minima .",
    "we have performed the simulation for different given random potentials with thermalizaion sweeps ranging from 30,000 to 200,000 and averaged over 200,000 to 2,000,000 mc steps and only very small difference have been found . when taking data we have chosen the number of thermalizaion sweeps to be 50,000 for all cases and averaged over 200,000 to 400,000 steps with more steps for lower temperature .",
    "table 1 gives an example for the parameters we have chosen for the simulation in the case of long ranged correlated potential .",
    "the mean square displacement of the particle as well as the sample to sample fluctuations of the mean square displacement are calculated in our simulation , and all data points are averaged over 2000 samples of the random potential .    for the classical case , previous numerical results for the long range case , were reported by @xcite for the long ranged case and also by @xcite for both the short and long ranged cases .",
    "they did not perform monte carlo simulation , but used the fact that in the classical case instead of a path integral one has to evaluate a simple integral for each realization of the random potential . for large @xmath107 , where the results should reduce to the classical case",
    ", we have checked our results for the mean square displacement against their s , and the agreement is quite good , taking into account the fact that we have averaged over 2000 realizations of the disordered versus 10000 in @xciteand 40000 in @xcite . in doing a pimc",
    "we did not have enough computer time to average over a larger number of realizations .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the results of the monte carlo simulations for the mean square displacement , for the case of long ranged correlated potential . for comparison we show",
    "the results obtain from the analytical solution reported in i. as in the classical case we observe that when quantum effects are turned on , the rs symmetric solution gives an unphysical result below @xmath108 , down to a certain critical @xmath60 .",
    "the rsb solution gives rise to a flat behavior of @xmath109below @xmath110 .",
    "the actual results of the qmc show that the function is indeed monotonic , but no sharp transition is observed , and it continues to decrease at all temperatures .",
    "a sharp transition is only expected at @xmath111 , whereas the simulation has been carried out at @xmath25 , where @xmath11 is the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the variational approximation also gives rise to a sharp transition at all dimensions , much like the large-@xmath11 result . as @xmath112decreases ,",
    "tunneling increases and the glassines of the system decreases as the particle is able to tunnel across potential barriers .",
    "this is evident in the analytical solution by the decrease of @xmath110 with decreasing @xmath113 , until there is no longer any transition .    in this simulation",
    "we found that the statistical errors are dominated by the sample to sample fluctuations of @xmath114 ( the discussion of this quantity is in the next paragraph . ) .",
    "for this reason , the error bars in fig.4 are given by @xmath115 with the number of samples being @xmath116 in our case .",
    "we give only the error bars for the case of @xmath117 and @xmath118 otherwise the figure would become too messy .",
    "the error bars increase with increasing @xmath60 .",
    "also , in table 2 we give the value of @xmath119 for the first and second 1000 samples for @xmath60=0.2 , 0.3 , and 1.0 .",
    "we found that all the values of @xmath120 are within the error bars for those values of @xmath60 which is very reasonable .",
    "what is the signature of this effect in the simulations ? in order to see this effect we measured the sample to sample fluctuations of @xmath121 .",
    "this is a direct measure for the glassiness of the system . in fig .",
    "5 we depict the sample to sample fluctuation of @xmath121 and observe that for small enough @xmath113 the function becomes flat with decreasing temperature which signals the fact that quantum effects wipe out the glassy behavior . this figure is to be compared with the fig . 2 obtained from the variational approximation .",
    "we also have to notice that the large sample to sample fluctuation of @xmath122 in the low temperature regime also indicates that the error bars on our graphs for @xmath5 are relatively large in the glassy phase .",
    "in fact the uncertainty of our calculation from only 2000 samples in not enough to make a highly precise quantitative description of the behavior of this system .",
    "nevertheless , for a qualitative study of this system at low temperature our simulation gives a clear picture .",
    "similar results were obtained for the case of short ranged correlated potential . in fig .",
    "6 we display the pimc results for the mean square displacement together with the results obtained in i from the analytical calculation for the rs solution .",
    "the analytical solution has been obtain for power correlations with @xmath27 , but from the variational approximation any faster falling correlation should give similar results .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the sample to sample fluctuations of @xmath121 for the short ranged case , as obtained from the qmc simulations to be compared with fig",
    ". 3 obtained the analytical variational calculation .",
    "again we observe the reduction of the glassines of the system with the increase of the quantum effects .    to conclude",
    ", we observe the relatively good agreement between the qmc simulation and the results of the variational calculation .",
    "some of the deviations are of course due to the variational approximation , but they are also due to the fact that in the simulation we averaged only over 2000 realizations .",
    "the results show that the sample to sample fluctuations of the mean square deviation of the particle from the origin are a good measure for the glassiness of the system which decreases with increasing quantum effects ( increase of @xmath123 .",
    "thus the qualitative similarity with the phase diagram of the quantum spin glass in a transverse field is established .",
    "we thank the pittsburgh supercomputer center for support under grant no .",
    "thanks the weizmann institute for support as a michael visiting professor , where part of this work has been done .",
    "for the temperature range where the rs solution is valid , it has been shown in appendix b of i how to obtain the numerical solution of the self consistent equations ( 4.15 ) and ( 4.16 ) of i. when replica symmetry is broken , in the case of long - ranged correlated potential , the equations for self energy matrix are given in eqs .",
