    "the discovery of the @xmath11 higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in july 2012 @xcite has cuased tremendous progress to be made in particle physics and represents a great victory for the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the main tasks of future experiments is to determine the gauge couplings in the sm and test the validity of the gauge principle .",
    "triple gauge boson production at the lhc provides an opportunity for the precision measurement of quartic gauge boson couplings , and it would help us to better understand the electroweak symmety breaking @xcite . in the past years , the theoretical predictions for all this kind of processes at the lhc have been calculated up to the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite , while the predictions up to the qcd + ew nlo for the @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite processes are provided .",
    "since precision measurements will be possible in the lhc run2 or future colliders , the calculations of @xmath15 productions , including the subsequent vector boson decays at the qcd + ew nlo , are desired .",
    "this issue was listed in the les houches 2013 high precision wishlist @xcite , and still exists in the report of les houches 2015 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 production at the lhc provides a window for studying the quartic @xmath16 coupling , and it also serves as a background to the supersymmetric tri - lepton production signature . in view of these reasons , precision calculations for this process are necessary in order to meet the requirements of the experimental measurement .",
    "the nlo qcd correction to @xmath17 without subsequent @xmath1-boson decay was calculated in refs.@xcite and @xcite , where the contributions from the diagrams with internal higgs - boson exchange are neglected .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the nlo qcd + nlo ew corrections to the @xmath18 process including @xmath1-boson leptonic decays in the sm , and find that the nlo ew correction is considerable and can not be ignored , even though it is suppressed by the smallness of the ew coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : calculation ] , we report the calculation details , in section [ sec : num ] we provide the integrated cross sections and the relevant kinematic distributions in the different event selection schemes , and finally , we provide a short summary .",
    "at the leading - order ( lo ) only the partonic channel @xmath20 contributes to triple @xmath1-boson production at the lhc .",
    "we adopt the five - flavor scheme and neglect the masses of @xmath21- , @xmath22- , @xmath23- , @xmath24- and @xmath25-quark throughout our calculations .",
    "the representative tree - level diagrams for the @xmath20 subprocess are shown in fig.[fig : lo ] .",
    "it should be noted that the feynman diagrams involving internal higgs - boson exchange , e.g. , fig.[fig : lo](1 ) , are included in our calculations , even though their contributions are relative small , accounting for about @xmath26 at the lo .    .",
    "]    the nlo qcd calculation for the @xmath27 process was previously performed in ref.@xcite , where the authors ignored the contributions from the diagrams with internal higgs - boson exchange . in order to verify the correctness of our program ,",
    "we have checked the nlo qcd corrected integrated cross section numerically by using both the madgraph5 @xcite package and our own program , with the same input parameters and considerations as those used in ref.@xcite .",
    "the numerical results for the nlo qcd corrected integrated cross sections are listed in table [ tab : cross - check ] .",
    "we find that the results obtained from both packages are highly coincident with those in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the detailed description of the nlo qcd calculation has already been given in a previous paper @xcite , we provide only the calculation setup of the nlo ew corrections in this section .",

    "the feynman diagrams concerned are automatically generated using feynarts-3.7 package @xcite , and the corresponding amplitudes are algebraically simplified by employing the formcalc-7.3 program @xcite . in order to deal with the numerical instabilities which appear in the evaluation of the scalar and tensor one - loop integrals , we use the improved looptools-2.8 package @xcite which can automatically switch to quadruple precision codes when the gram determinant is sufficiently small @xcite .    the nlo ew correction to",
    "the @xmath18 process includes the following four parts : ( 1 ) the ew virtual one - loop correction to @xmath29 ; ( 2 ) the real photon emission correction from @xmath30 ; ( 3 ) the contribution of the collinear photon emission part of the quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) ew counterterm ; ( 4 ) the photon - induced correction consisting of the contributions from @xmath31 ( photon - induced subprocesses ) and the collinear quark emission part of the quark pdf ew counterterm .    to analyze the origin of the nlo ew correction clearly , we separate the nlo ew correction into photonic ( qed ) and genuine weak corrections .",
    "the weak correction comes from the weak virtual one - loop diagrams without virtual photon exchange .",
    "the rest of the nlo ew corrections are called qed corrections .",
    "then , the full nlo ew correction can be expressed as @xmath32    in both the qcd and ew calculations , we isolate the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences by adopting the dimensional regularization scheme in @xmath33 dimensions .",
    "we renormalize the relevant masses and fields in the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "the definitions and expressions for the relevant renormalization constants can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the renormalized electric charge is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the bare electric charge and @xmath36 is the corresponding renormalization constant .",
    "there are three schemes for the renormalization of the fine structure constant :    \\(1 ) the @xmath37-scheme , where @xmath38 is defined in the thomson limit , and the electric charge renormalization constant @xmath36 is written as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the weak mixing angle , and @xmath41 denotes the transverse part of the unrenormalized self - energy at four - momentum squared @xmath42 .",
    "\\(2 ) the @xmath43-scheme , where @xmath19 is evolved from zero four - momentum squared to the @xmath1 pole by the renormalization - group equations .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath44-scheme , in which @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 and the corresponding electric charge renormalization constant is @xmath47 where @xmath44 is the fermi constant , and @xmath48 is the nlo ew correction to the muon decay .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath48 can be written as @xcite @xmath49    for the process without an external photon line at the lo , in both the @xmath43-scheme and the @xmath44-scheme the large light - fermion logarithms resulting from charge renormalization in the ew correction can be cancelled . furthermore , according to the discussions in refs.@xcite and @xcite , it is suggested to use the @xmath44-scheme , then one can obtain some significant universal corrections to the lo contributions connected to the renormalization of the weak mixing angle .    in calculating the real photon emission and the photon - induced partonic processes",
    ", we use the two cutoff phase space slicing ( tcpss ) method @xcite to isolate the soft and collinear ir singularities . the singularities originating from these processes",
    "are partially cancelled by the photonic ir singularities from an exchange of the virtual photon in the loop , and the remaining singularities are absorbed by the related quark pdf ew counterterms",
    ". then we get ir - safe results and compare the integrated cross section results with those obtained by using the dipole subtraction ( ds ) method @xcite .",
    "we find that they are perfectly coincident with each other .",
    "in further calculations , we use the ds method to calculate the integrated cross section in order to get smaller monte carlo errors , and adopt the tcpss method in evaluating the kinematic distributions to avoid the so - called missed binning problem in the ds method @xcite .",
    "we take the cutoffs in the tcpss method as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and set @xmath52 in the ds method @xcite to control the volume of the dipole phase space .",
    "the emission of the photon collinear to the decayed lepton leads to a correction enhancement due to large logarithms , and influences the kinematic distributions and acceptance rate of the leptons .",
    "however , large logarithms from the final - state radiation ( fsr ) could be prevented by defining  dressed \" leptons @xcite , which would treat the collinear lepton - photon system as one quasi - particle .",
    "usually , the final - state electrons are detected automatically as  dressed \" electrons by an electromagnetic calorimeter , while muons are detected at the lhc as  bare \" particles by other detectors , without an automatic combination with the photons .",
    "a similar situation happens with tau leptons . in order to reduce large fsr correction , the observed  bare \" leptons can be reconstructed as  dressed \" leptons via photon recombination @xcite .",
    "thus , in the nlo ew calculation , we neglect the corrections from the real photon radiation off the final charged leptons , and consider the final charged leptons as  dressed \" leptons in discussing their kinematic distributions .",
    "the relevant sm input parameters in our calculation are listed as follows @xcite : @xmath67 the @xmath1-boson decay width of @xmath68 in the fixed width scheme is obtained by using the madspin program with the above input parameters .",
    "we set all the leptons and light quarks , including the bottom quark , to be massless . considering no charged boson exchange in the lo graphs for the @xmath0 production and the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , it is acceptable to take ckm matrix as a unit matrix . for simplicity",
    "we take the renormalization and factorization scales as being equal ( @xmath69 ) in case there is no other statement , and @xmath70 is defined as the central scale .",
    "the ew corrections from the photon - induced partonic processes are convoluted with the photon distribution function .",
    "the nnpdf2.3qed pdfs @xcite are ideal options for this requirement .",
    "the value of the strong coupling constant is quoted as @xmath71 from the pdf set with five active flavors .",
    "the @xmath72 factorization scheme is used throughout the nlo qcd calculation , while the dis factorization scheme is applied in the nlo ew calculation @xcite .      in analogy to the nlo ew correction",
    ", the full nlo qcd correction to the @xmath73 process can be expressed as @xmath74 the nlo qcd and ew relative corrections are given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the weak and qed relative corrections , respectively . in the above definitions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are evaluated by using nlo pdfs , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are lo cross sections calculated using the lo and nlo pdfs , respectively .",
    "the expression @xmath82 in eq.([relative correction ] ) indicates that @xmath82 contains the nlo qcd contributions from both the dynamic matrix element and the pdfs . on the other hand ,",
    "the ew correction is normalized by @xmath81 but not @xmath80 , which guarantees @xmath83 to be free from the qcd correction effects in the nlo pdfs , and exposes the matrix element correction effects in a more transparent way .",
    "the full nlo qcd + ew corrected cross section is obtained by combining the nlo qcd and ew corrections via the following naive product @xcite : @xmath84    the numerical results of the lo , nlo qcd , nlo qcd + ew corrected integrated cross sections and the corresponding relative corrections for the @xmath0 production at the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath85 hadron colliders are listed in table [ tab : cross - sections ] .",
    "the results are compared in the table by using different event selection schemes .",
    "we call the inclusive scheme without any cuts scheme i , and the exclusive scheme with the jet veto condition of @xmath86 scheme ii . from the table",
    ", we can see that the nlo qcd relative correction is sizable , and increases steadily from @xmath8 at the @xmath87 to @xmath88 at the @xmath85 in scheme i. however , it decreases sharply to be no more than @xmath89 when the jet veto cut of @xmath86 is applied .",
    "this means that the real gluon and light - quark emission contributions are significant and account for a large part of the full nlo qcd correction .    on the other hand , although suppressed by the smallness of the ew fine structure constant , the nlo ew correction is surprisingly remarkable in all chosen colliding energies and event selection schemes .",
    "differing from the dramatic reduction in the nlo qcd relative correction by applying a jet veto , the nlo ew relative correction is pretty stable at about @xmath90 .",
    "the qed relative correction @xmath91 is listed in table [ tab : cross - sections ] as well .",
    "we can see that @xmath91 is about @xmath92 for all the colliding energies and event selection schemes considered .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the nlo ew correction mainly comes from the weak correction .    in our calculation , we find that the nlo contribution from the initial photon - induced partonic processes is only about @xmath93 of the full nlo ew correction , i.e. , @xmath94 , therefore the theoretical uncertainty from the photon pdf can be neglected .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the nlo qcd + nlo ew corrections to the @xmath0 production with subsequent @xmath1-boson leptonic decays at the lhc by adopting the improved narrow width approximation , which takes into account off - shell contributions and spin correlations . </S>",
    "<S> integrated cross sections at @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 hadron colliders and various kinematic distributions are presented . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that the jet emission correction accounts for a large part of the total qcd correction , especially in the high energy region . by applying a proper cut to the jet transverse momentum , e.g. , @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , the jet emission correction can be reduced and the cross section is less dependent on the factorization / renormalization scale . </S>",
    "<S> this work reveals that both the nlo qcd and the nlo ew corrections are significant . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the nlo qcd , nlo ew and nlo qcd + ew relative corrections in the inclusive event selection scheme at the @xmath7 lhc can reach @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , which means that neither the nlo qcd nor the nlo ew correction is negligible in precision calculations .    </S>",
