    "coupled harmonic oscillators are the first approximation to a broad class of extended systems not only in different fields of physics but also in chemistry and biology . within the quantum formalism , they are the basis of the description of electromagnetic field interactions in quantum optics and approximate lattice systems in different traps in atomic physics @xcite . moreover , in the last few years there has been impressive progress towards the cooling and back - action evasion measurement of ` macroscopic ' -in terms of number of atoms- harmonic oscillators , allowing the observation of their quantum behavior .",
    "two main class of systems experimentally realized are nanoelectromechanical structures ( nems ) @xcite and different kinds of optomechanical systems @xcite where nano- and micromechanical devices , cavities or suspended mirrors are respectively coupled to single electrons or light . as an example , it has recently been reported the observation of nems extremely near to the ground state of motion with an occupation factor of just 3.8 @xcite .",
    "these experiments would allow to observe coherent quantum superposition states , entanglement and to study decoherence processes in a controllable way on massive solid - state objects .",

    "an important advantage is that these systems admit gaussian state solutions having a well defined @xcite computable @xcite measure of entanglement , the logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "the question of the generation of entanglement has also been addressed considering oscillators whose parameters are modulated in time @xcite . in these studies losses",
    "were generally neglected , while recently the effects of decoherence on a pair of entangled oscillators have been considered in presence of dissipation through baths of infinite oscillators @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to analyze a rather unexplored aspect of this problem that is _ the effect of the diversity _ on the entanglement between coupled harmonic oscillators in different situations .",
    "indeed , instead of considering identical oscillators , we look at the effects of detuning between their frequencies , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the interest about diversity effects on entanglement is both theoretical and related to experimental issues .",
    "we mention , for instance , the effect of diversity of frequencies of two photons entering in a beam splitter .",

    "the main expected consequence is indeed an effective decoupling of the oscillators due to fast rotation of their interaction term and we will show the effects on the robustness of entanglement .    it is clear that the identity of the oscillators in general is a very peculiar and strong assumption not always justified and introducing a symmetry into the system with deep consequences .",

    "coupled oscillators with different frequencies have been also suggested for quantum limited measurements @xcite .",
    "finally , in many experiments coupled oscillators actually model different physical entities ( for instance radiation and a moving mirror in optomechanics ) and a symmetric hamiltonian would describe only a very special case @xcite .",
    "our analysis of entanglement evolution encompasses both diversity between harmonic oscillators and dissipation .",
    "once the oscillators are prepared in some entangled state ( for instance through sudden switch of their coupling ) , we look at its robustness increasing diversity and coupling strength . it is well known that an object whose all degrees of freedom are coupled to an environment will decohere into a thermal state with the same temperature as the heat bath @xcite .",
    "the thermal state , unless temperatures are very low , is separable and highly entropic , so that after thermalization all entanglement shared between the coupled oscillators disappears @xcite . as the dissipating oscillators reach a separable state in a finite time , and not asymptotically ,",

    "we will see how asymptotic entanglement can be preserved in presence of diversity , through a proper choice of the system - bath coupling constants .",
    "another difference in the case of common bath is the lack of the symmetry @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath31 is clearly modified by the transformation @xmath30 . however , once the canonical transformation @xmath32 is introduced , such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 , it is easy to show that the master equation is invariant under the combined action of @xmath32 and the flip of @xmath35 .",

    "all these considerations are true only in the case of separate baths .",
    "once the common bath is taken , because of the action of @xmath32 , the mode coupled to the bath is @xmath28 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in the case of separate baths , results for opposite @xmath35 are equivalent to a change in the sign of the initial squeezing , while this is not the case for a common bath .",
    "the calculation of bipartite entanglement for mixed states is generally an unsolved task .",
    "nevertheless , the criterion of positivity of the partial transposed density matrix of gaussian two - mode states @xmath46 is necessary and sufficient for their separability @xcite .",
    "the amount of entanglement can be measured through the logarithmic negativity , defined as @xmath47 , being @xmath48 the modulus of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "for any two - mode gaussian state , the logarithmic negativity is @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath46 .",
    "because the system is connected to heat baths , the dissipating degree of freedom will ultimately attain the thermal state corresponding to the system hamiltonian .",
    "the properties of entanglement in the thermal state are well studied , whence it is known that only for very low temperatures entanglement is present between the two oscillators .",
    "therefore we focus our attention on the time evolution of the decoherence process itself , namely how fast an initially entangled state decays into a separable one , for separate ( sect .",
    "[ decayseparate ] ) and common ( sect .",

    "we consider as a non - separable initial state the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( [ tms ] ) , with squeezing parameter @xmath42 .",
    "this state has an amount of entanglement proportional to @xmath42 and consists in the orthogonal modes @xmath51 being simultaneously squeezed and stretched , respectively , by an amount @xmath42 .",
    "such a state , for infinite squeezing , gives the maximally entangled state for continuous variables , long known due to the famous paper by einstein , rosen and podolsky @xcite .",
    "the entanglement evolution in presence of separate baths is shown in fig .",
    "[ figplots]a for different parameters choices , showing the effects of increasing the coupling strength and the detuning .",
    "entanglement , in general , decays with an oscillatory behavior with oscillation amplitude depending on the @xmath35 strength @xcite .",
    "we study the last time at which entanglement vanishes , @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ fig0b ] and [ fig0 ] we scan how long it takes for such an entangled state ( with @xmath53 ) to become separable when the oscillators detuning and coupling strength are varied .",
    "indeed , the last time @xmath52 is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for different values of the ratio between frequencies ( @xmath54 ) and coupling between oscillators ( @xmath55 ) .    for this choice of parameters ,",
    "[ fig0b ] shows that entanglement is present for few tens of periods . due to the scaling of temperature , time , and couplings with the frequency of the first oscillator , @xmath1 , it is clear that results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig0b ] and [ fig0 ] are not symmetric by exchange of the oscillators role .",
    "in other words , even if it is physically equivalent to have the first oscillator with half the frequency of the second one or the second half the first one , due to the scaling , these figures are not symmetric with respect to the line @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig0b ] shows two main features : ( i ) an increase of the survival time @xmath52 when @xmath54 is increased ; ( ii ) an increase of @xmath52 with @xmath57 in absence of diversity ( @xmath58 ) , while for @xmath59 this dependence is weakened .",
    "this can also be appreciated in the perspective presented in fig .",
    "both features can be explained in terms of the eigenmodes of the system @xmath60 ( [ eigenmodes ] ) and their eigenfrequencies @xmath61 ( [ eigenfr ] ) .",
    "since the eigenmodes do not interact with each other , they can be regarded as independent channels for decoherence .",
    "the eigenmodes will only interact with near - resonant frequencies in the bath .",
    "in addition , all variances at the thermal states they approach are dependent upon the fraction @xmath62 .    as far as it concerns the feature ( i ) , in absence of coupling ( @xmath63 , implying @xmath64 ) and for @xmath65 , the ` effective temperature ' of the final thermal state reached by the eigenmode @xmath66 will vanish , @xmath67 .",
    "the eigenmodes will therefore reach respectively a thermal state ( @xmath68 ) and a ground state ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "since the presence of entanglement is a competition between the reduced purities of individual oscillators and the total purity @xcite , just by improving the final purity of oscillator @xmath66 its time evolution has an overall higher purity , thus making entanglement higher ( and its survival time longer ) .",
    "this effect is equivalent to reduce the real temperatures of the baths ( while keeping everything else constant ) .",
    "while the decoherence is given by the coupling @xmath70 and is hence not reduced , the reached final state is purer and thus entanglement is seen to survive longer .",
    "as far as ( ii ) is concerned , for @xmath58 the eigenfrequencies of the system are @xmath71 . by increasing @xmath57 up to @xmath72 the eigenfrequency @xmath73 vanishes and",
    "the amount of bath modes which have a similar frequency , given by the spectral density , also vanishes ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "that is , the amount of bath modes with which this degree of freedom interacts tends to zero , and therefore the amount of decoherence suffered .",
    "this effect , however , is partially compensated by the fact that a vanishing @xmath75 would imply that this mode will reach a thermal state of effective infinite temperature .",
    "were it not so , the entanglement would survive asymptotically , as in the case of common bath , where for @xmath58 the mode @xmath75 does not decohere .",
    "we then see that all major effects related to entanglement decay between coupled oscillators in presence of heat baths can be explained in terms of : 1 ) eigenfrequencies ( where they lie within the spectral density of the heat baths ) , and 2 ) effective temperatures reached by the eigenmodes after thermalization .",
    "a minor feature is that the increase of @xmath52 with @xmath35 and @xmath2 is not completely smooth due to entanglement oscillations and this gives rise to the ` arena'-shaped dependence that is clearer in fig .",
    "in general , the dependence of the decoherence time on the oscillation frequency of the system is negligible for optics experiments at ambient temperatures ( @xmath76 ) , but becomes extremely important in presence of the lower frequencies of mechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "notice that we have restricted the coupling within the boundary @xmath77 ( triangle in the lower part of fig .",

    "two features are apparent : in presence of a nonzero coupling @xmath35 ( continuous lines ) entanglement oscillates strongly , and second , in the case of separate baths any initial entanglement vanishes fast , while in the case of common bath it can be made to survive by having identical frequencies.,width=302 ]     ( see text ) as a function of the oscillators coupling and frequency detuning , in the case of separate baths .",

    "this model can be considered a limit case while separate baths would model the opposite one , when baths are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the presence of asymptotic entanglement in this situation has been studied by @xcite , showing that entanglement can survive for sufficiently low temperatures ( or conversely for high enough initial squeezings ) . in the case with different frequencies",
    "paz and roncaglia noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this asymptotic behavior disappears as the detuning is increased , meaning that it is highly dependent on the frequency matching between oscillators and the fact that each oscillator s bath can be regarded as ` perfectly correlated ' to the other one . in physical realizations these two conditions will hardly be met and it is interesting to know the effect of deviations from it . we have then studied the effects of frequency diversity in the case of a common bath , looking again at the robustness of entanglement in terms of the decay time @xmath52 ( fig.[figplots]b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show results equivalent to what represented in fig . [ fig0 ] but for common bath .",

    "when the oscillators frequencies begin to differ , survival diminishes fast to values similar to the uncorrelated baths case .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood from the master equation ( [ me_comm ] ) . the fact that the coupling to the bath is @xmath84 establishes that the mode @xmath28 remains decoupled at all times , thus keeping its coherence and contributing positively to a nonzero entanglement .",
    "if the frequencies are different , that mode gets coupled to @xmath45 which is itself coupled to the bath , and its decoherence is transferred to @xmath28 .",
    "this way , both modes are decohered and end up in a thermal state , with no presence of entanglement . hence the survival time is finite .",
    "because of this , it is worthy to stress the fact that even if the frequency difference is infinitesimal , decoherence will eventually show up , even though it does so in a time inversely proportional to the infitesimum . thus , increasing the difference in frequencies just exacerbates the transfer velocity of decoherence from mode @xmath45 to mode @xmath28 .",

    "it is in fact true that , in the case of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , a correction to the entanglement decay time can only be observed assuming low initial squeezing ( @xmath109 ) . when @xmath70 starts to increase , it is possible to deal with cases where some observable corrections due to non - markovianity emerge also in the low - temperature regime .",
    "in particular , the case of equal frequencies turns out to be the more sensitive . to give an example , in fig .",
    "[ nmars ] we compared the two evolutions for two different values of @xmath42 .",
    "starting from @xmath53 , non - markovian corrections are almost negligible , giving corrections of few percents to the value of @xmath52 found within the markovian approximation . in order to observe a noticeable difference , we must start with a factorized state ( @xmath110 ) . as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ nmars ] , in this case , while memoryless baths are able to support a very small quantity of entanglement , the initial kick given by non - markovian coefficients enhances entanglement generation , its maximum amount is amplified of about one order of magnitude , and also its death time is increased .",
    "it is however worth noting that the absolute value reached is , in any case , very low .    , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the initial squeezings are a ) @xmath53 and b ) @xmath110.,width=264 ]",
    "during last years , a series of papers has investigated entanglement dynamics of coupled harmonic oscillators in contact with thermal environments . nevertheless , a comprehensive analysis around the role played by the diversity of the two oscillators was missing .",
    "we started our discussion with the case of separate baths , which seems to be more physically meaningful .",
    "as one should expect , after a transient , unless the temperature is very low , the initial two - mode squeezed state @xmath114 becomes separable .",
    "studying the decay time , we observed a series of interesting features that we have qualitatively explained .",
    "first of all , by increasing @xmath54 and by keeping unchanged all other parameters , entanglement survival time increases as well",
    ". in the limit of @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath75 tend , respectively , to @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "since the asymptotic thermal state the system is reaching depends itself on the frequencies , the purity of the final state is enhanced together with the coherence time necessary to reach it . on the other hand , near @xmath58 , entanglement survival time",
    "can be raised also by increasing @xmath117 . when @xmath118 , @xmath75 is close to zero . here , we argue that the behavior we observe is the result of two competing effects .",
    "if , on one side , the thermal equilibrium state is less pure because of the presence of a vanishing frequency , on the other side , the number of decohering channels goes to zero , since @xmath75 falls in a poorly populated region of the spectral density , increasing in this way the time necessary to reach the thermal equilibrium .    if the two oscillators share a common bath , it becomes possible the observation of asymptotic entanglement at relevant temperatures .",
    "one of the two eigenmodes of the system can result in fact decoupled from the environment . as a consequence of this decoupling",
    ", the asymptotic density matrix will result as the direct sum of the matrix of pure state and of a thermal state , corresponding to the mode interacting with the bath .",
    "when the two oscillators have identical frequencies and bath couplings , the mode @xmath28 gets decoupled independently of the value of @xmath35 , giving rise to the plateau we observe in figs . [ fig1b ] , [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is important to stress that this regime can be achieved not only when the oscillators are resonant , but also in presence of frequency detuning , through a proper engineering of the system - bath interaction .",
    "conversely , if their bath couplings are different @xmath87 , frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be found so that this special regime is achieved .",
    "we also studied the dynamical evolution of the degree of quantumness of the system by means of the quantity @xmath95 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ vard ] ) .",
    "the negativity of this quantity is a direct evidence of the negativity of the glauber - sudarshan quasi - probability distribution of the state .",
    "the agreement between the behavior of @xmath95 and the entanglement is worth to be investigated , since a tight relation between them is not known .    as for the markovian versus non - markovian debate",
    ", we compared the two behaviors in a wide range of parameters . while in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors investigated what changes when the frequency of the oscillators goes outside from the spectral distribution of the bath in the high temperature regime , we tried to do an extensive analysis for @xmath119 .",
    "our results indicate that non - markovian corrections can be observed , and are important , only for a reduced subset of initial conditions . to see them , we must put a relevant coupling between oscillators and bath , @xmath1 should be close to @xmath2 , and the initial state should be ( almost ) disentangled .",
    "since the master equation has been obtained in the weak - coupling limit , the first of this assumptions seems at least questionable .",
    "if we release only one of them , markovian and non - markovian evolutions are almost identical .",
    "a system - bath model is usually described through the hamiltonian @xmath120 , where @xmath121 refers to the system and @xmath122 to the bath , and where @xmath123 is the term containing the interaction .",
    "generally , the coupling term can be written as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 denote system operators and @xmath126 bath operators .",
