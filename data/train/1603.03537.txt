    "resistivity measurements are employed extensively in the field of strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) . since transport properties",
    "are determined by the electronic dynamics at the fermi level , resistivity is often extremely sensitive to fermi surface changes and electronically - driven phase transitions ; however , since resistivity is a second - rank tensor , transport measurements are generically limited in their ability to identify the _ symmetry _ properties of the underlying order .",
    "in contrast , the elastoresistivity ( a fourth - rank tensor defined as the strain derivative of the resistivity ) can convey additional information about directional anisotropies and broken point group symmetries which might more subtly manifest in the resistivity itself.@xcite furthermore , since electron - lattice coupling in sces is often large , the order parameter characterizing an electronically - driven phase transition in these materials is often strongly tuned by strain and strongly reflected in transport ; the coefficients in the elastoresistivity tensor are then likely to be large , making elastoresistivity very promising from an experimental perspective .",
    "although elastoresistance measurements have been applied to semiconductors,@xcite this physical quantity has only recently been measured in the context of sces;@xcite in both cases , however , measurements have been confined to _ longitudinal _",
    "geometries ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) , and the wider class of _ transverse _",
    "( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( c ) ) measurements ( which are the subject of this paper ) have not been investigated .     or @xmath2 elastoresistivity coefficients of a tetragonal material .",
    "the appropriate orientation of the principal crystal axes with respect to the current @xmath6 and the strains @xmath7 ( horizontal black arrows ) and @xmath8 ( vertical gray arrows ) for the two irreducible components is discussed in sections [ sec : difflong ] and [ sec : transverse ] of the main text .",
    "gray bars represent single crystal samples and yellow regions depict electrical contacts used for the transport measurements ; current paths and schematic voltmeters are also indicated .",
    "the samples are caused to experience an induced anisotropic strain by some external means and the strains @xmath7 and @xmath8 are separately determined . in the configuration shown in panel ( a )",
    ", a standard four - point contact geometry is used to measure the differential longitudinal elastoresistivity ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) . in panel",

    "the relevant elastoresistivity coefficients are determined from the difference of the two longitudinal measurements .",
    "as described in the main text , these configurations have some practical drawbacks ; in particular , one infers a ( potentially small ) resistive anisotropy from the difference of two ( potentially larger ) longitudinal resistivity measurements . in this paper",
    "we describe an alternative _ transverse _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath12 ) measurement that can be performed on one single crystal ( depicted in panel ( c ) ) that yields the same elastoresistivity coefficients by directly determining the resistivity anisotropy from a single measurement . ]    for a tetragonal material , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of the elastoresistivity tensor characterize the material s linear response to the anisotropic strains @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "these two components of the elastoresistivity tensor directly connect to the nematic susceptibility for the same two symmetry channels , @xmath15 and @xmath16.@xcite we have recently shown how these coefficients can be determined from differential longitudinal elastoresistance measurements and have used this technique to investigate a series of materials which exhibit electronic nematic instabilities.@xcite    anisotropic strain can be achieved by gluing crystals to the side surface of a piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate ( pzt ) stack with a strain - transmitting epoxy . in this implementation , the crystals are mechanically coupled to and hence deform with the pzt , which expands ( contracts ) along its poling direction ( perpendicular to its poling direction ) upon application of a positive external voltage .",
    "longitudinal resistances are then measured while the strain is varied and the differential longitudinal elastoresistance determined from the difference of the two measurements . in the original realization of this experiment , two separate transport bars were used in order to separately determine the longitudinal elastoresistivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( a ) ) .",
    "while these measurements unambiguously identified a divergence of the nematic susceptibility in the @xmath2 symmetry channel for the iron - based superconductors,@xcite nevertheless this specific experimental configuration leads to several experimental concerns .",
    "in particular , the technique relies upon equal strain transmission for the two samples used in the differential measurement ( which might be difficult to realize in practice , in part due to geometric factors and in part due to differences in the adhesion of the two samples to the pzt stack ) . expressed in the context of group theory , such nonidealities ( which we describe in greater detail in section [ sec : difflong ] ) admix elastoresistivity coefficients with an @xmath17 character ( i.e. , isotropic in - plane , or symmetric with respect to rotation about the @xmath18-axis ) , potentially affecting the determination of the associated elastoresistivity coefficients in other symmetry channels .    to avoid the possible contamination of isotropic strain that can manifest in a differential longitudinal elastoresistivity measurement , it is preferable to extract the differential elastoresistivity from a measurement performed on just one single crystal sample that is held under conditions of anisotropic strain .",
    "one such method is to use the modified montgomery technique to measure the induced anisotropy in the longitudinal resistivity of a square shape sample ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we recently applied such a technique to measure the differential elastoresistance of several families of iron - based superconductors.@xcite while this technique obviates concerns over strain transmission to the sample , nevertheless it still requires separate measurement of two ( potentially large ) longitudinal resistivities as a function of strain , the ( potentially small ) difference of which yields the desired @xmath1 or @xmath2 components of the elastoresistivity tensor . ideally , one would determine this difference directly .",
    "we note that it is indeed possible to measure the induced resistivity anisotropy ( and hence the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of the elastoresistivity tensor ) from a single measurement .",
    "in particular , we note that a tetragonal material which undergoes an orthorhombic distortion by breaking symmetry about its @xmath19 and @xmath20 mirror planes ( i.e. , undergoes a @xmath2 distortion in which the in - plane square lattice deforms into a parallelogram ) acquires finite off - diagonal terms in the resistivity tensor ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) which are proportional to the amount of orthorhombicity .",
    "hence , one can obtain the same information _ from a single measurement _ of the _ transverse _ elastoresistivity ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the primary advantage of the transverse method is that it directly measures the associated resistive anisotropy from a single measurement of a single sample .",
    "furthermore , by symmetry , the measured quantity can not be affected by isotropic strain in the linear regime .    in this manuscript",
    ", we propose and demonstrate a new method for probing the nematic susceptibility in the @xmath2 channel @xmath16 based on measuring the transverse elastoresistivity @xmath12 .",
    "one common problem that can arise with measurements of a transverse resistivity is @xmath23 contamination in a nominal @xmath21 measurement due to contact misalignment , and so we also provide a practical means for subtracting such contamination . since transverse elastoresistivity measurements have to date neither been discussed nor measured , we provide here a detailed description of the relevant tensor quantities and a suitable technique that enables such a measurement .",
    "we proceed by first describing appropriate coordinate frames and associated transformations of the elastoresistivity tensor , necessary for the subsequent discussion .",
    "we then explain the various configurations for measuring the corresponding elastoresistivity coefficients , along the way characterizing certain forms of experimental error .",
    "we conclude by presenting @xmath4 data acquired via the new method for the representative iron - pnictide bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , which was chosen since it has previously been well - characterized by differential longitudinal measurements@xcite and has a large elastoresistive response .",
    "the temperature dependence of the elastoresistivity coefficients as observed by the transverse method agree with the earlier differential measurements , revealing a nematic instability in the @xmath2 symmetry channel .",
    "similar to our earlier differential longitudinal measurements , anisotropic strain for the transverse elastoresistance measurements was achieved by gluing the sample to the surface of a piezoelectric pzt stack ; however , we note that the proposed technique does not rely on this specific realization , and alternative methods to strain the sample can be readily envisioned .",
    "as a consequence of strains experienced by a material , terms in the resistivity tensor @xmath24 acquire a strain - induced change    @xmath25    the elastoresistivity @xmath26 is a fourth - rank tensor that linearly relates the ( normalized ) strain - induced resistivity change @xmath27 and the strain @xmath28 according to    @xmath29    where we choose to represent the second - rank tensors @xmath27 and @xmath28 as the column vectors    @xmath30    in order to represent @xmath31 as a @xmath32 matrix .",
    "the appropriate normalization scheme is given by@xcite    @xmath33    because of onsager s",
    "relation,@xcite the resistivity tensor is not in general symmetric in the presence of a magnetic field and so we avoid usage of the compactified voigt notation in order to present a generalized description appropriate for finite @xmath34 .",
    "the point group symmetry of the crystal lattice constrains the number of independent nonzero coefficients in the elastoresistivity tensor ; for example , the elastoresistivity tensor for the specific case of the @xmath35 point group ( appropriate for bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 and derived elsewhere@xcite ) is given in appendix [ appendix : tensortransform ] .",
    "in labeling the elastoresistivity coefficients by spatial coordinates , we have implicitly assumed a cartesian system referenced to the crystal itself and defined by its primitive lattice vectors .",
    "we refer to this reference frame as the `` crystal frame '' and denote it by unprimed @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 axes . in order to extract symmetry information about the crystal , one",
    "is generally concerned with measured quantities in the crystal frame .",
    "we consider an experiment in which the crystal experiences a purely normal ( i.e. , shear - free ) homogeneous strain in a given cartesian frame of reference defined by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 basis vectors .",
    "for example , this could be realized with a piezoelectric pzt stack , where the basis vectors are defined by the lateral dimensions of the stack .",
    "we refer to this reference frame as the `` normal strain frame '' , which ( by choice ) shares a mutual @xmath42 axis with the crystal frame but is oriented at an in - plane angle @xmath43 relative to the primitive axes of the crystal frame ( i.e. , @xmath44 , where @xmath43 is positive when the crystal frame is oriented counterclockwise relative to the normal strain frame ) .",
    "the relative angle @xmath43 reflects our freedom to strain the crystal along arbitrary directions relative to the primitive crystal cell .",
    "additionally , when we perform an in - plane resistivity measurement , we have the freedom to direct the current along an arbitrary in - plane direction with respect to the crystal axes .",
    "we define this `` transport frame '' by double - primed cartesian vectors @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ; @xmath45 is the direction in which the current is sourced , @xmath46 is the in - plane direction perpendicular to @xmath45 , and @xmath47 is the out - of - plane direction perpendicular to @xmath45 .",
    "the transport frame shares a mutual @xmath48 axis with the crystal frame but is oriented at an in - plane angle @xmath49 relative to it ( i.e. , @xmath50 , where @xmath49 is positive when the crystal frame is oriented counterclockwise relative to the current frame ) .",
    "the relative orientation of the three coordinate frames is depicted in figure [ fig : coordinates ] .     about their mutual @xmath42 axis , while the crystal and transport frames are related by a relative angle @xmath49 about their mutual @xmath48 axis . ]    when performing an in - plane elastoresistivity measurement , the normalized changes in resistivity @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are measured in the transport frame ( which is rotated relative to the crystal frame by an angle @xmath49 ) , while the strains @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are measured in the normal strain frame ( which is rotated relative to the crystal frame by an angle @xmath58 ) ; they are related by means of appropriately transformed elastoresistivity coefficients according to    @xmath59    where the @xmath60 , @xmath61 are suitable transformation matrices given in appendix [ appendix : tensortransform ] and the subscripts in the elastoresistivity coefficients denote that the strains are measured in the normal strain frame ( primes ) while the normalized changes in resistivity are measured in the transport frame ( double primes ) .",

    "the elastoresistivity tensor takes a particularly simple form when decomposed in terms of its irreducible representations ( as determined by the point group symmetry of the crystal lattice ) .",
    "such a decomposition motivates making specific combinations of elastoresistance measurements in order to isolate particular elastoresistivity coefficients in the same symmetry class . for example , for the @xmath35 point group , the normalized resistivity changes in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 irreducible representations are proportional to the corresponding elastoresistivity coefficients ( @xmath66 and @xmath4 , respectively ) in the same symmetry channel and are related to the nematic susceptibilities @xmath15 and @xmath16 in those irreps.@xcite there are , however , different experimental geometries that can be used to extract these combinations of coefficients .",

    "equivalently , the effects of rotationally invariant strains are subtracted out in taking the @xmath1 or @xmath2 combination , as we originally noted.@xcite however , arbitrary in - plane rotations are not symmetry elements of @xmath35 ( only the discrete @xmath68 rotations about the mutual @xmath69 axis are symmetries of the point group ) , and so rotating the crystal frame by an arbitrary angle @xmath49 relative to the transport frame and/or by an arbitrary angle @xmath43 relative to the strain frame can mix @xmath1 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) quantities ( measured in the crystal frame ) into each other .",
    "for certain high symmetry directions of the current and normal strains relative to the crystal axes , though , one can isolate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coefficients and hence infer the behavior of the corresponding susceptibilities in those symmetry channels .",
    "the high symmetry configuration for @xmath66 ( @xmath70 ) is @xmath62 ( i.e. , the transport , current , and normal strain frames are all coincident ) , while the high symmetry configuration for @xmath4 ( @xmath71 ) is @xmath72 ( i.e. , the crystal frame is oriented at @xmath73 radians relative to the transport and normal strain frames ) ; these arrangements are depicted in figure  [ fig : symmetryconfiga ] and can be confirmed with .",
    "this was precisely the configuration used in our initial measurements of the elastoresistance of iron - based@xcite and heavy fermion@xcite superconductors .",
    "the same information can also be extracted from a modified montgomery geometry.@xcite      there are several sources of systematic errors in the differential longitudinal measurement configuration , all of which merit a brief comment .",
    "the primary reason for doing so in the context of this paper is then to motivate the alternative transverse measurement configuration which does not suffer some of these drawbacks .",
    "here we focus specifically on errors associated with the standard four - contact geometry ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( a ) ) , but a similar analysis could be applied to the modified montgomery technique .    * ( a ) * in order to measure @xmath66 or @xmath4 , crystals should be oriented such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . in practice , misalignment will occur which will affect the measured elastoresistivity coefficients . within the present formalism , we can propagate this error to leading order ; in this section , we quote the main results , referring the reader to appendix  [ appendix : alignmenterrors ] for the full derivation .",

    "expanding these errors to leading order about the high symmetry configurations @xmath62 and @xmath72 , the elastoresistivity coefficients @xmath3 ( in the first configuration ) and @xmath4 ( in the second configuration ) are misestimated by a factor    @xmath81.\\ ] ]    the angular alignment errors systematically induce an underestimate of the true elastoresistivity coefficients and come in at second order in the misalignment ; even if all angles were off by as much as 5@xmath82 ( a typical experimental uncertainty ) , the total error would only be @xmath83 , and so the high symmetry configurations are relatively insensitive to minor angular offsets .",
    "additionally , misalignment with respect to the high symmetry configurations also mixes @xmath1 coefficients into a nominal measurement of the @xmath2 symmetry channel and vice versa .",
    "the amount of mixing from the other symmetry channel is proportional to    @xmath84,\\ ] ]    which again is at second order in the misalignment .",
    "this mixing due to misalignment could be significant if the relative difference in the magnitudes of the elastoresistivity coefficients in the two symmetry channels is large .",
    "for example , for the specific case of the iron - based superconductors in which @xmath16 diverges , measurement of @xmath66 is affected by admixture of the much larger @xmath4 coefficient , whereas measurement of @xmath4 is essentially unaffected by admixture of a small amount of the much smaller @xmath66.@xcite    * ( b ) * + * * the differential longitudinal technique relies on both samples experiencing the same homogeneous strain .",
    "if the samples experience a different strain due to experimental nonidealities ( see next section for a discussion relevant to the specific technique we have employed ) , this will also affect the deduced elastoresistivity coefficients .",
    "relative strain errors are of potentially greater concern than misalignment errors since any strain offset error occurs at first order . strain offsets also erroneously mix in @xmath17-like coefficients and hence contaminate a nominal nematic susceptibility measurement with the effects of isotropic strain ( see discussion in appendix [ appendix : strainmagnitudeerrors]).@xcite comparison of nominal @xmath1 and @xmath2 coefficients can help bound the amount of @xmath17 contamination ( since such rotationally invariant contamination would manifest equally in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 measurements ) .",
    "hence , it is still possible to classify which symmetries are broken at the phase transition ( i.e. , assigning the order parameter to a particular irreducible representation of the space group ) ; however , these concerns motivate development of a technique that does not rely on separate measurements of different samples but which is based instead on measurement of a single sample .",
    "this is the primary motivation for adopting either the modified montgomery technique ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( b ) ) or the transverse elastoresistance technique ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( c ) ) that we introduce in section [ sec : transverse ] .    *",
    "( c ) * + * * in addition to the sources of systematic error discussed above , additional errors can be introduced which are specific to the particular technique that is used to strain the samples . for our experimental realization in which single crystals are glued to the side surface of a pzt stack",
    ", these errors are related to differential thermal contraction and strain homogeneity .",
    "we emphasize , however , that strain homogeneity and differential thermal contraction are not necessarily generic to elastoresistivity measurements ; alternative methodologies may be able to mitigate or circumvent these particular sources of error while potentially incurring others .",
    "differential thermal contraction between the sample and the pzt stack on which it is mounted implies that the sample is strained even when no voltage is applied to the piezoelectric . at high temperatures ,",
    "this is a small effect since the dynamic range over which the sample can be strained exceeds the `` bias '' strain due to such thermal effects.@xcite however , the situation is reversed at cryogenic temperatures . upon cooling to 100 k , the crystal experiences a large , anisotropic strain ( of about @xmath85)@xcite solely from the pzt due to an expansion along its poling direction ; depending on the voltage range that is applied to the pzt stack , this can be much larger than the dynamic strain that the pzt can apply due to an applied voltage at this temperature ( @xmath86 at 150 v),@xcite which means that the strain experienced by the crystal may not be able to be tuned through zero .",
    "so long as the material is still in the regime of linear response , which can be checked , the elastoresistivity coefficients can still be faithfully measured ; however , alternative methodologies@xcite can also be employed which mitigate such effects and more closely yield zero strain conditions .",
    "so far , our analysis has assumed no relaxation of the strain through the thickness of the crystal . in practice",
    ", the strain will relax towards its unstrained edges on a certain length scale determined by the elastic stiffness of the sample and the extent to which the sides of the crystal are `` clamped '' by the epoxy . to mitigate such effects , samples to be measured",
    "must have a thickness that is much smaller than the in - plane dimensions .",
    "concerns about strain relaxation in the narrow in - plane direction relative to the long in - plane direction can be completely allayed by using a modified montgomery technique for crystals with a square shape ( figure  [ fig : difflongvstrans ] ( b)).@xcite strain transmission has been verified for larger crystals with a similar aspect ratio to those used for the present elastoresistivity measurements by gluing strain gauges directly on the top surface of the crystal.@xcite    finally , for crystals with dimensions comparable to the separation distance between two pzt layers , and depending on where the crystal is mounted relative to a pzt layer junction , the strain that the crystal experiences can vary with position on the pzt surface .",
    "the pzt stacks that we have employed have been stacked along their poling direction with an individual layer thickness of @xmath87 @xmath88 m and a separation between layers of @xmath89 @xmath88 m . if a crystal with a width roughly equal to these thicknesses is adhered along the multilayer interface ( as is required in a differential longitudinal elastoresistance measurement ) and inauspiciously placed in the interfacial separation region , the crystal will experience little strain even with a voltage applied to the piezo .",
    "this sort of inhomogeneity can be ameliorated by spreading the strain transmitting epoxy to encompass more area than just the interface region , attention to placement on the pzt substrate , and use of larger crystals .",
    "modified techniques can also be readily envisaged that yield a more homogeneous strain .",

    "the most straightforward manner in which one might encounter longitudinal contamination is due to imperfect contact geometry ( as in figure  [ fig : transversemisalignment ] ) or to nonlinearly directed current paths within the crystal .",
    "while microscopic details to do with the specific mechanism of current non - uniformity would dictate how such a longitudinal contamination would be subtracted out , we instead focus on how to subtract out the longitudinal contamination due to contact misalignment , otherwise assuming a homogeneous material with uniformly directed current paths .",

    "also diminishes the sample size over which the fit is performed and relaxes constraints on the parameters in the fit model , bullseye plots also display a general trend of decreasing rmse as one increases ( decreases ) the low ( high ) end cutoff in the independent variable window ; one therefore expects a general trend of decreasing rmse as one approaches the bottom right region of the contour map .    in the context of the present measurement ,",
    "the expected model is a curie - weiss temperature dependence and the color output of the bullseye plot in figure  [ fig : rmse ] corresponds to the residual difference ( for each temperature window ) between the inverse susceptibility @xmath293 and a linear function of temperature . for each fixed window , we first estimate the temperature - independent parameter @xmath157 by a least rmse minimization procedure between the measured @xmath4 and the curie - weiss form ; with this @xmath157 , we then estimate the best - fit parameters @xmath154 and @xmath49 by minimizing the rmse between the @xmath293 and a linear fit .",
