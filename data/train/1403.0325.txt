    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the cosmic web of filaments and clusters of galaxies is expected to be permeated with the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the igmf plays crucial roles in various subjects of astrophysics ; propagations of ultra - high energy cosmic - rays and @xmath2-rays ( @xcite ) , radio emissions in galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) , substructures during cluster mergers ( @xcite ) , and configurations of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "seed igmfs could be generated in inflation , phase transition , and recombination eras ( @xcite ) , during cosmic reionization ( @xcite ) , and through cosmological shock waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "the seed fields of any origins could be further amplified through compression and turbulence dynamo in the structure formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , leakages of magnetic fields and cosmic rays from galaxies should be taken into consideration ( @xcite ) .",
    "the above diverse processes underline the importance of observational tests for the igmf .",
    "one of a few possible methods to probe cosmic magnetic fields is to utilize faraday rotation in radio polarimetry ( @xcite ) .",
    "a rotation of the polarization angle is proportional to the square of the wavelength , and the proportionality constant , rotation measure ( rm ) , provides an integration of magnetic fields with weights of electron densities .",
    "this conventional method , however , could work only in the case of observing a single polarized radio source .",
    "otherwise , in cases of multiple emitters along the line - of - sight ( los ) , a rotation of the polarization angle draws a complex curve ( @xcite , hereafter bd05 ) , and rm can not be easily estimated .",
    "moreover , rms of a few to several tens @xmath3 are usually associated with radio sources ( @xcite ) and the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "these rms are larger than expected rms through filaments , @xmath4 ( @xcite ) , and can not be easily separated from an observed rm by the conventional method .",
    "therefore , we need to establish alternative methods which allow us to estimate hidden rm components along the los .    as a method to separate multiple sources and rms along the los , a revolutionary technique , called faraday rm synthesis or faraday tomography ,",
    "was first proposed by @xcite and extended by bd05 .",
    "previous works for the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) , the galaxy ( @xcite ) , external galaxies ( @xcite ) , and active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) have demonstrated that the technique is powerful to resolve rm structures along the los .",
    "it would be thus promising to study the igmf in eras of wide - band radio polarimetry including square kilometer array ( ska ) and its pathfinders / precursors such as low frequency array ( lofar ) , giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , and australia ska pathfinder ( askap ) ( see @xcite , a summary of telescopes therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss observational strategies to probe the igmf by means of faraday tomography .",
    "we consider frequency coverages and numbers of channels of future observations .",
    "faraday tomography is in general improved by incorporating decomposition techniques such as rmclean ( @xcite ) and qu - fitting ( @xcite ) . however , decomposition techniques have their own uncertainties ( @xcite ) . therefore , we concentrate on a standard method of faraday tomography without any corrections to see its original potential .",
    "in fact , the decomposition is powerful for our study , which was addressed in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the method of faraday tomography and describe our model .",
    "the results are shown in section 3 , and the discussion and summary follow in section 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we first summarize a basic concept of faraday tomography following a manner described by bd05 .",
    "the readers who have interests in detailed derivations and improvements of algorithm should refer to recent works ( @xcite ) .",
    "a fundamental observable quantity is the complex polarized intensity , @xmath5 , at a given wavelength , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the stokes parameters .",
    "@xmath9 is given by an integration of intensities along the los as ( @xcite ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the faraday dispersion function ( fdf ) which is a complex polarized intensity at a given faraday depth , @xmath12 .",
    "faraday depth is defined as @xmath13 in units of @xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the thermal electron density in @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the los magnetic field strength in @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the los physical distance in pc .    the fdf should be a function of @xmath6 in general ( bd05 ) , but , following @xcite , we assume that all considerable radio sources have similar spectra and neglect wavelength dependence of the fdf .",
    "hence equation ( [ eq1 ] ) has the same form as the fourier transform and the fdf can be formally obtained by the inverse fourier transform : @xmath19 however , this inversion is not practically perfect , because @xmath9 is not defined for negative @xmath20 and the coverage for positive @xmath20 is limited in real observations .",
    "bd05 generalized equation ( [ eq : f ] ) by introducing a window function , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 if @xmath20 is in observable bands , otherwise @xmath23 . observed complex polarized intensity",
    "can then be written as @xmath24 where the tilde indicates observed or reconstructed quantities . from @xmath25 , we can obtain an approximate reconstruction of the fdf as , @xmath26    we define the rotation measure spread function ( rmsf ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the normalization . applying the convolution theorem ,",
    "the approximate fdf , @xmath29 , can be written as , @xmath30 therefore , the reconstruction ( [ eq : convolution ] ) is perfect only if the rmsf reduces to the delta function , @xmath31 , for a ( unphysical ) complete observation , i.e. @xmath32 for all @xmath20 ( eq . [ eq : rmsf ] ) .",
    "in fact , the rmsf has a finite width ( see figure [ f3 ] ) , so that the data sampling is incomplete and the reconstruction is not perfect . equations ( [ eq : rmsf])-([eq : convolution ] ) indicate that the quality of the reconstruction primarily depends on the window function .",
    "that is , a wider coverage in @xmath20 space improves the reconstruction , as expected from the analogy with fourier transform .    in this paper , we follow the above window - function approach considering the observable bands of ska and its pathfinders . for other approaches , where the values of non - observed @xmath9",
    "are estimated by some assumptions on the properties of the sources ( see @xcite ; bd05 ) .      since the sign of @xmath16 in equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "can be changed , @xmath33 is not a monotonic function of @xmath34 in general .",
    "therefore , the fdf , i.e. , the distribution of radio sources in @xmath12 space , does not simply indicate the distribution of radio sources in @xmath34 space . nevertheless , the fdf is enough to probe the igmf , because the igmf can be identified in @xmath12 space as demonstrated in this paper .",
    "we first introduce general behavior of the fdf .",
    "if thermal electrons inducing rms co - exist with cosmic - ray electrons emitting synchrotron polarizations , the fdf has finite thickness in @xmath12 space .",
    "also , an accumulation of emissions and rms within a source results in a thickness , if the sign of @xmath16 changes many times and the accumulation behaves like a random walk process .",
    "such a thickness would be natural for the galaxy and extragalactic radio sources .",
    "in addition , if there are magneto - ionic media in front of radio - emitting region , e.g. , associated media such as clouds , h@xmath35 filaments , and swept igm by jets , the fdf shifts in @xmath12 space .",
    "the shift is also caused by rms of discrete intervening galaxies ( @xcite ) and foreground igmfs in clusters / filaments of galaxies .",
    "we probe the igmf in filaments of galaxies from the shift of the fdf in @xmath12 space .",
    "thus , the shifts caused by other origins are contaminations .",
    "loss containing significant rms of other origins could be avoided as follows . for removing rms of galaxy clusters",
    ", we could exclude sources behind galaxy clusters ( e.g. , coma cluster , @xcite ) .",
    "the detection limit of current x - ray facilities is enough to substantially exclude rms of galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "rms of associated media around sources and rms of intervening galaxies could have a tight correlation with optical absorber systems and/or could show small fractional polarization due to depolarization ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we could discard sources with such contaminations .",
    "note that the rm of the igmf would not affect depolarization , since the igmf is expected to be smooth enough within the beam size of @xmath36arcsecond ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , rms for associated media of distant sources could be small due to a @xmath37 dilution factor .",
    "@xcite estimated the dilution and claimed that sources at @xmath38 should only contribute a standard deviation of rms @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we assume that we can select sources toward which the shifts of the fdf caused by rms of galaxy clusters , the associated media , and intervening galaxies are negligible .",
    "( 75mm,40mm)f1.eps    hereafter , to make our arguments simple , we mainly describe cases for a pure real @xmath40 obtained if the intrinsic polarization angle is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "the result for a complex @xmath40 is discussed in section [ section4 ] .    using selected sources , we consider possible and suitable fdfs to probe the rm due to the igmf .",
    "figure [ f1](a ) shows an example of the fdf .",
    "we consider an observation of a background compact source b ( emissions from a radio galaxy or a quasar ) viewed through the cosmic web a and a foreground diffuse source a ( galactic emissions ) .",
    "the fdf of the cosmic web a has tiny amplitude , since radio emissions from the igm are generally much weaker than the others .",
    "therefore , the rm of the cosmic web a can be probed as the  gap \" between fdfs of the two sources .",
    "we name this observational strategy as  strategy a \" .",
    "the situation arises if all signs of cumulative rms of the two sources and the cosmic web coincide .",
    "otherwise , some of them would overlap each other in @xmath12 space .",
    "the probability that all signs coincide is @xmath41 , which is reasonably high to choose such loss from multiple observations . even in the overlapped case",
    ", there would be still the gap if the rm of the cosmic web is much larger than those of sources .",
    "therefore , the probability that we find the gap is expected to be larger than 25  % .    in this strategy ,",
    "foreground emissions are necessary to be detected .",
    "the intensity of galactic diffuse emission toward high galactic latitudes can be scaled as @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the frequency and @xmath44 is the beam size ; @xcite ) , and is larger toward lower latitudes .",
    "the diffuse emission is thus significant , unless we observe very bright compact sources . in section 3.1",
    ", we will demonstrate that the diffuse emission is significant even if the background emission is 100 - 1000 times brighter .",
    "if the source b is a distant source , the fdf of the source b would be faraday thin ( the thickness is small enough , i.e. a delta function ) .",
    "but we keep considering small thickness for compact sources since the thickness as well as the rmsf are notable ambiguities to probe the igmf , particularly for observations with limited bandwidths .",
    "if the source b is faraday thin , the gap is sharpened and the estimation of the rm due to the igmf is rather improved .",
    "along with strategy a , we can consider an extended strategy to probe the igmf .",
    "that is , we observe two compact sources and obtain two fdfs ( figures [ f1]a and [ f1]b ) .",
    "we then subtract one fdf from the other to obtain the difference ( figure [ f1]c ) .",
    "if the directions of two loss are close enough , fdfs of the source a and the cosmic web a are cancelled out each other in the difference , then the difference reveals the gap between two fdfs in @xmath12 space . and",
    "if the sources b and c are both faraday thin , the gap precisely indicates the rm of the cosmic web b. we name this observational strategy as  strategy b \" .",
    "( 80mm,40mm)f2.eps    figure [ f2 ] shows how much rm could be different between two loss , based on the simulations @xcite .",
    "for example , let us suppose that the rm of the cosmic web b is 7.5 @xmath3 .",
    "if the angular separation between the nearby source b and the distant source c is less than @xmath45 , the rm difference of the foreground source a could be less than 20% ( 1.5 @xmath3 ) of the rm of the cosmic web b. the same level of the rm difference is available for the cosmic web a , if the nearby source b is locate at @xmath46 and the angular separation is less than @xmath47 .",
    "a rm difference of @xmath48 @xmath3 for an angular separation of @xmath45 for the gmf is consistent with the gradient of galactic rm toward high galactic latitudes , a few @xmath3 per degree ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that much smaller - scale structures have been observed toward the galactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider practical cases for strategies a and b. in strategy a , if the source b is located at @xmath38 , rms of associated media would be @xmath36 a few @xmath3 . therefore , if the rm of the cosmic web a exceeds @xmath36 several @xmath3 , it could be predominant on the shift of the fdf of the source . in strategy",
    "b , if the source b is located at @xmath49 , the rm difference of the cosmic web a is @xmath50 @xmath3 for the angular separation of @xmath47 .",
    "the source b could contain rms of @xmath51 @xmath3 for associated media .",
    "thus , if the rm of the cosmic web b exceeds @xmath52 @xmath3 , it could be predominant on the shift of the fdf of the source c. such a value is likely if the los goes through more filaments than the average between the observer and the sources .",
    "moreover , if we can obtain information of optical absorptions and/or depolarization and can select the sources toward which rms of associated media and intervening clouds are insignificant , we could identify a much smaller rm of the cosmic web b.    we expect that there will be a number of ideal sources for strategies a and b in millions of candidates to be found in future observations .",
    "for example , no absorber systems were detected toward about a half of 84,534 quasars so far @xcite and a number of radio sources show large fractional polarization @xcite .",
    "pair sources are still rare in the largest catalog with the average separation @xmath45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "but the separation will decrease by @xmath47 with ska precursors and @xmath53 with the ska , so that the number of the pairs would soon increase dramatically .",
    "supposing that optical observations confirm two independent sources b and c , strategy b could be available even if the sources are in a single beam and are not resolved in space .",
    "but if the faraday depth between two sources is less than the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the rmsf , faraday tomography may miss to reconstruct two fdf peaks for some specific intrinsic polarization angles .",
    "this phenomenon is known as rm ambiguities ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , strategy b for unresolved sources is available if the gap caused by the igmf is sufficiently larger than the fwhm of the rmsf .",
    "such a limitation is practically relaxed if we include low frequency data providing a small fwhm of @xmath54 .",
    "thanks to progresses of low frequency radio observations such as lofar and murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , we would easily access low frequency data and could remove the ambiguity .      instead of observational data , we use the data calculated from fdf models .",
    "we adopt simple fdf models , since the gap appears regardless of detailed profiles of fdfs for sources .",
    "the analyses below are rather independent on the shape of the fdf , because it is to be reconstructed by observations .",
    "a fdf of a diffuse source is modeled with a function based on the hyperbolic tangent , since the function tends to better reproduce the resultant platykurtic profile expected from the galaxy models ( @xcite ) : @xmath55,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the parameter which controls the width of the skirts , and @xmath57 is the position of the back side edge of the fdf in @xmath12 space .",
    "we set @xmath58 for the position of the front side edge , where no generality is lost by this choice since the gap is measured from relative position of the sources in @xmath12 space .",
    "we choose @xmath59 and the thickness of the fdf @xmath60 as representative values .",
    "we normalize fdf intensities of any sources by @xmath61 , since relative amplitude of fdfs is only meaningful while we do not consider observational errors .",
    "a fdf of a compact source such as a quasar and a radio galaxy has been approximated by a gaussian ( @xcite ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the position of the fdf center in @xmath12 space , and @xmath64 determines the thickness of the fdf .",
    "we choose @xmath65 , and the thickness as @xmath66 region of the fdf is @xmath67 as a reachable value for selected sources ( sections 2.2 and 2.5 ) .",
    "such a value is actually expected for some sources toward high galactic latitudes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate compact sources with @xmath68 .",
    "a fdf of the cosmic web is modeled with @xmath69 this means that no emission is considered .",
    "as already mentioned , polarized intensities due likely to synchrotron radiations of cosmic - ray electrons in the igm are generally very small except radio halos and relics in galaxy clusters .",
    "faraday depth of the cosmic web is based on theoretical predictions ( @xcite ) ; the rms value of rm is @xmath0 through a single filament at the local universe , and @xmath70 in integrating filaments up to @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite also found that some of loss going through dense filaments and/or group of galaxies in filaments have rms of a few tens @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we consider rm of the cosmic web , @xmath72 . note that probing the rm of @xmath73 would be fundamentally difficult because of contaminations ( sections [ section2.2 ] and [ section2.3 ] ) .",
    "but we also test the case to see the capability of faraday tomography for such a small gap .",

    "but we could solve the ambiguity , if we carry out an  off - source \" observation and gain the fdf of the galaxy only .",
    "we notice that a real fdf of the galaxy should depend on galactic longitude and latitude as well as properties of turbulent magnetic fields such as the driving scale , the mach number , the plasma @xmath123 , and so on ( @xcite ) .",
    "although considerations of them are beyond the scope of this paper , developing realistic fdfs of the galaxy must be an important subject to make the detection of the gap more reliable .",
    "realistic fdfs of the galaxy based on akahori et al .",
    "( 2013 ) will be presented in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 80mm,40mm)f9.eps    another simplification in this paper was to neglect observational effects .",
    "particularly , it is true that there are significant noise on polarized intensities and some frequencies are probably missing due to radio frequency interferences ( rfis ) .",
    "we demonstrate these effects as follows .    for effects of observational noise",
    ", we include the noise into the observable polarized intensity , @xmath25 , and get the reconstructed fdf .",
    "we consider a random gaussian noise in each @xmath20 domain .",
    "the results with noise amplitudes of 30 , 50 , and 100 % of the polarized intensities for representative cases are shown in top panels of figures [ f9 ] and [ f10 ] .",
    "we see that the noise amplitude of 30 % does not dramatically alter the overall profile of the fdf , and the reconstructed fdf would be useful up to the noise amplitude of @xmath124 .",
    "such a requirement of the noise would limit the sample of radio sources that could be considered .",
    "( 80mm,40mm)f10.eps    as for effects of rfis , we discard the data in frequencies where significant rfis exist , and get the reconstructed fdf .",
    "we refer to the recent assessment report of rfis for the ska candidate sites , x and y. the results for representative cases are shown in bottom panels of figures [ f9 ] and [ f10 ] .",
    "we can see less - peaked profiles for compact sources due to lack of data in low frequencies around @xmath125 mhz and @xmath126 mhz .",
    "such a broadening of the fdf for the compact source would produce uncertainties of a few @xmath3 on the estimation of the gap .",
    "reconstructed fdfs have significant skirts and side lobes originating from the rmsf .",
    "such skirts and side lobes are a major ambiguity to probe the igmf .",
    "the issues related to the rmsf could be , however , improved by using decomposition techniques such as rmclean @xcite and calibrations of the rmsf by phase correction ( bd05 ) and symmetry assumption @xcite .",
    "also , wavelet - based tomography @xcite would allow better representation of localized structures in the data unlike with decompositions with harmonic functions in the fourier transform .",
    "qu - fitting ( @xcite ) and compressive sampling / sensing @xcite would be also promising to probe the gap caused by the igmf .    another important improvement to get better reconstructions of the fdf is even sampling in @xmath20 space .",
    "although we have assumed even sampling in the simulations , observations sample the data evenly in @xmath6 space so far .",
    "such data produce unevenly - sampled data in @xmath20 space , and cause large numerical artifacts in fourier transform . in order to minimize numerical errors on the fourier transform , development of flexible receiver systems which allow us to sample the data evenly in @xmath20 space",
    "would be a key engineering task for future radio astronomy ( e.g. , casper / roach ) .",
    "in order to probe faraday rotation measure ( rm ) of the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) in the cosmic web from observations of rms for extragalactic radio sources , we need to separate contributions of other origins of rms . in this paper , we discussed possible observational strategies to estimate the rm due to the igmf by means of faraday tomography ( faraday rm synthesis ) .",
    "our quantitative discussion indicated that there are two possible strategies - an observation of a compact source behind a diffuse source ( strategy a ) and a comparison between the observation with another observation for a nearby compact source ( strategy b ) .",
    "for the two strategies , we investigated the capability of faraday tomography in present and future wide - band radio polarimetry . for strategy",
    "a , we confirmed that the rm due to the igmf can be seen as the relative faraday depth between the two sources .",
    "a promising polarized intensity of the compact source relative to the diffuse source is @xmath127 . as for strategy",
    "b , we found that the relative faraday depth of the compact sources gives a reasonable estimate of the rm with errors less than a few tens percents for lofar or ska observations , if the rm is larger than @xmath128 .",
    "such an accuracy is expected while the compact sources are @xmath129 times brighter than the diffuse source .",
    "strategy b provides better estimations of the rm , but strategy a is also important to increase the chance of the estimation .",
    "since we have adopted simple models of radio sources , we discussed more realistic cases for specific situations .",
    "we demonstrated that the multiple changes of intrinsic polarization angle within a diffuse source would not make the estimation of the relative faraday depth between the two sources worse .",
    "multiple peaks may become an ambiguity for identifying the gap caused by the igmf , but the ambiguity could be solved with an off - source observation .",
    "we also considered effects of observational noise and radio frequency interferences , and found that these effects can be practically insignificant for the estimation , at least for the moderate levels of noise and rfi considered here .",
    "our simulations and discussions indicate that it is still not easy to explore rm of @xmath73 for the igmf , because of incompleteness of the reconstruction as well as ambiguities due to rms associated with the source and intervening clouds .",
    "these issues would be , however , improved by decomposition techniques as well as theoretical and observational studies of faraday depolarization . with the improvements",
    ", we would finally reach observations of the igmf in filaments of galaxies .",

    "<S> unveiling the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) in filaments of galaxies is a very important and challenging subject in modern astronomy . in order to probe the igmf from rotation measures ( rms ) of extragalactic radio sources , we need to separate rms due to other origins such as the source , intervening galaxies , and our galaxy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss observational strategies for the separation by means of faraday tomography ( faraday rm synthesis ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an observation of a single radio source such as a radio galaxy or a quasar viewed through the galaxy and the cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the observation with another observation of a neighbor source with a small angular separation . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations with simple models of the sources suggest that it would be not easy to detect the rm due to the igmf of order @xmath0 , an expected value for the igmf through a single filament . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to it , we find that the rm of at least @xmath1 could be detected with the ska or its pathfinders / precursors , if we achieve selections of ideal sources . </S>",
    "<S> these results would be improved if we incorporate decomposition techniques such as rmclean and qu - fitting . </S>",
