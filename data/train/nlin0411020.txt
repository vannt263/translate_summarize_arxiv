    "control of the chaotic dynamics of complex nonlinear systems is one of the most important and rapidly developing topics in applied nonlinear science . in particular , the concept of chaos control , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , has attracted a great deal of attention over the last decade . among different methods for controlling chaos that have been suggested by now ,",
    "the so - called non - feedback control is attractive because of its simplicity : no measurements or extra sensors are required .",
    "the idea of this method is to change the complex behavior of a nonlinear stochastic system by applying a properly chosen external force .",
    "it is especially advantageous for ultra - fast processes , e.g. , at the molecular or atomic level , where no possibility to measure the system variables exists .",
    "many of the suggested non - feedback methods employ the external forces acting at the system frequencies  @xcite , including parametric perturbations with the frequency that is in resonance with the main driving force . in particular , changing the phase and frequency of a parameter perturbation in a bistable mechanical device was shown to either decrease or increase the threshold of chaos  @xcite .",
    "similarly , unstable periodic orbits are known to be stabilized by a low - frequency modulation of a system control parameter  @xcite , when the control frequency is much lower than the system frequency .    a possibility to change significantly the system dynamics by applying a high- ( rather than low- ) frequency force",
    "is known for almost a century . as a textbook example",
    ", we mention the familiar stabilization of a reverse pendulum ( known as the kapitza pendulum ) by rapid vertical oscillations of its pivot  @xcite . this discovery triggered the development of vibrational mechanics  @xcite where the general analysis of nonlinear dynamics in the presence of rapidly varying forces is based on the krylov - bogoljubov averaging method  @xcite . in the control theory ,",
    "the high - frequency forces and parameter modulations are usually used for the vibrational control of non - chaotic nonlinear systems  @xcite . however , as was shown for the example of the duffing oscillator  @xcite , chaos suppression can also be achieved by applying a high - frequency parametric force .",
    "later , chaos suppression in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction was demonstrated numerically by adding white noise  @xcite , and the effect of random parametric noise on a periodically driven damped nonlinear oscillator was studied by the melnikov analysis  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the concepts of the nonresonant non - feedback control to the lorenz system and demonstrate analytically , numerically , and also experimentally that the suppression of the chaotic dynamics can be achieved by applying a high - frequency parametric or random parametric force .",
    "the lorenz system , found in 1963 , is known to produce the canonical chaotic attractor in a simple three - dimensional autonomous system  @xcite , and it can be applied to describe many interesting nonlinear systems , ranging from thermal convection  @xcite to lasers dynamics  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present our model and outline the theoretical method and results . by applying the averaging method",
    ", we derive the effective lorenz equations with the renormalized control parameter and obtain the conditions for chaos suppression . in sec .",
    "iii , we demonstrate the suppression of chaos by means of direct numerical simulations and also present the experimental data obtained for an analog electronic circuit .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv concludes the paper .",
    "we consider the familiar lorenz system  @xcite driven by a parametric force . in the dimensionless variables , the nonlinear dynamics",
    "is governed by the equations @xmath0 { \\displaystyle        \\dot{y } = r [ 1 + f(t)]x - y -xz ,         } \\\\*[9pt ] { \\displaystyle        \\dot{z } = xy - bz ,     } \\end{array }     \\label{eq_1}\\ ] ] where the dots stand for the derivatives in time , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the parameters of the lorenz model , and the function @xmath4 describes a parametric force . for definiteness but without restrictions of generality , we select the standard set of the parameter values , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas the parameter @xmath2 is assumed to vary .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that , in the absence of the parametric driving force @xmath4 , the original lorenz equations demonstrate different dynamical regimes on variation of the control parameter @xmath2 , which are associated with the existence and stability of several equilibrium states . in brief , the system dynamics can be characterized by three regimes :    * the @xmath7 regime , for @xmath8 : there exists the only stable fixed point at the origin , @xmath9 ; * the @xmath10 regime , for @xmath11 : the origin becomes unstable , two new fixed points appear , @xmath12 ; * the @xmath13 regime , for @xmath14 : no stable fixed points exist , chaotic dynamics occur with a strange attractor .",
    "we consider the special case of the general model  ( [ eq_1 ] ) , assuming that the characteristic frequency of the parametric force @xmath4 is much larger than the characteristic frequency of the unforced lorenz system , where the frequency ( which is the mean - time derivative of the phase ) of the lorenz system can be defined as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of turns performed in @xmath17 .",
    "first , we consider the case of _ a periodic driving force _ , @xmath18 assuming that the frequency of parametric modulations is large ( @xmath19 ) , we apply an asymptotic analytical method  @xcite based on a separation of different time scales , and derive the effective equations that describe the slowly varying dynamics . to do this",
    ", we decompose every variable into a sum of slowly and rapidly varying parts , i.e. , @xmath20 where the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 describe fast oscillations around the slowly varying envelope functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the rapidly oscillating corrections are assumed to be small in comparison with the slowly varying parts , and their mean values during an oscillation period vanish , i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "substituting the eq .",
    "( [ eq_4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) with the force ( [ eq_3 ] ) , and averaging over the oscillation period , we obtain the following equation , @xmath30 { \\displaystyle        \\dot{y } = rx -y -xz + rk < \\xi \\cos ( \\omega t ) > ,         } \\\\*[9pt ] { \\displaystyle        \\dot{z } = xy - bz ,     } \\end{array }     \\label{eq_5}\\ ] ] where the terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 are neglected because , for large @xmath33 , they are all of the higher orders in @xmath34 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq_5 ] ) and keeping only the terms not smaller than those of the order of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , we find the equations ,  @xmath36 and @xmath37 . regarding the function @xmath38 as constant during the period of the function @xmath4 , we obtain the solution @xmath39 , and thus @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the averaged equations ( [ eq_5 ] ) are @xmath30 { \\displaystyle        \\dot{y } = r_{\\rm eff}x -y -xz ,         } \\\\*[9pt ] { \\displaystyle        \\dot{z } = xy - bz ,     } \\end{array }     \\label{eq_8}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 as a result , the averaged dynamics of the lorenz system in the presence of a rapidly varying parametric force is described by the effective renormalized lorenz equations ( [ eq_8 ] ) with the effective control parameter @xmath42 , so that all dynamical regimes and the route to chaos discussed earlier can be applicable directly to eq .",
    "( [ eq_8 ] ) , assuming the effect of the renormalization .",
    "therefore , in terms of the averaged system , for @xmath43 , i.e. under the condition @xmath44 the fixed point at the origin remains stable and , therefore , in terms of the original lorenz system , the chaotic dynamics should be suppressed .",
    "next , for @xmath45 , i.e. under the condition @xmath46 the lorenz chaos is also suppressed and the stable saddle - focus points appears : @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    relations ( [ eq_9 ] ) and ( [ eq_10 ] ) that follow from the averaged equations , define the conditions for the chaos suppression ; they can be expressed as relations between the amplitude and frequency of the rapidly varying oscillations , @xmath49 @xmath50 the dependencies @xmath51 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq_9 ] ) and ( [ eq_10 ] ) ) and @xmath52 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) and ( [ eq_12 ] ) ) are the key characteristics of the chaos suppression effect that we verify numerically and compare with the experimental data obtained with an analog electronic circuit ( see figs .  4 and 5 below ) .",
    "now we turn to the case of a _ random force _ , and treat the function @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) as random by formally writing @xmath53 , where @xmath54 describes a bandwidth - limited noise with a power spectral density @xmath55 { \\displaystyle      0 , \\,\\;\\ ; { \\rm when } \\ ; |\\omega| < \\omega_1 , |\\omega| > \\omega_2 ,     } \\end{array }     \\label{eq_00}\\ ] ] and the zero mean value , @xmath56 . in order to apply the analytical method discussed above",
    ", the noise @xmath54 is assumed to be composed of high - frequency components only , i.e. @xmath57 , where @xmath58^{-1}\\ ] ] is the characteristic frequency of the bandwidth - limited parametric fluctuations .",
    "again , decomposing the system variables into sums of slow and rapidly varying functions and averaging over the period @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath30 { \\displaystyle        \\dot{y } = rx -y -xz + rk <",
    "\\xi(t ) \\epsilon(t ) > ,         } \\\\*[9pt ] { \\displaystyle        \\dot{z } = xy - bz ,     } \\end{array }     \\label{eq_14}\\ ] ] where the value of @xmath59 is much smaller than the characteristic time scale of the lorenz system oscillations but sufficiently larger than the time scale of fluctuations , i.e. @xmath60 .",
    "then , the equations for the rapid parts can be reduced to the equations , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the key averaged quantity becomes @xmath63 . on the other hand , for the stationary random process @xmath21",
    ", the following expressions are valid , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the power spectral density of @xmath21 and @xmath66 is the frequency response function for the equation @xmath67 . as a result , we obtain the averaged equations in the form ( [ eq_8 ] ) where this time [ cf .",
    "( [ eq_r1 ] ) ] @xmath68 the quantity @xmath69 is related to the intensity of the parametric fluctuations @xmath54 and it is always positive .",
    "since the averaged equations have the same form as the original unforced lorenz equations but with the effective control parameter @xmath42 instead of @xmath2 , there appears the parameter region where the chaotic dynamics is suppressed . in particular , for @xmath70 , i.e. , under the condition @xmath71 the fixed point at the origin remains stable in the presence of rapidly varying fluctuations .",
    "when @xmath45 , i.e. for @xmath72 two new saddle - focus fixed points appear , with the coordinates @xmath73 , @xmath74 .    .",
