    "the utility of motion surveys using data from the nasa _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) . has been described at length in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of its repeated observations of the entire sky , _ wise _ is ideally suited to producing a catalog of motion sources detectable in the wavelength regimes covered by its four bands : w1 ( 3.4 @xmath1 m ) , w2 ( 4.6 @xmath1 m ) , w3 ( 12 @xmath1 m ) , and w4 ( 22 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "most of the repeated sky coverage of _ wise _ is not in the w3 and w4 bands , which became saturated due to cryogen exhaustion partway through _ wise _",
    "s second pass of the sky , but in the w1 and w2 bands , which are largely unaffected by the cryogen loss .",
    "the w1 band probes deeply , enabling it to detect stars to great distances .",
    "the allwise @xmath295% completeness depth of w1 = 17.1 mag at high galactic latitudes ( @xcite ) means that early - l dwarfs can be detected to @xmath3250 pc , early - m dwarfs to @xmath33 kpc , and earlier - type stars to even greater distances . the w2 band is ideally suited for the detection of cooler objects , since these objects emit their peak energies at this band .",
    "in fact , _ wise _ is capable of detecting y - type brown dwarfs down to at least @xmath4 = 250k ( @xcite ) . hence , the repeated coverage at w1 and w2 makes _ wise _ an efficient search tool for moving stars and brown dwarfs of all types in the solar neighborhood .    for most spots on the sky ,",
    "_ wise _ imaging is confined to a span of a few days , with additional coverages possible six months later when that portion of the sky is again visible to the satellite .",
    "( at the ecliptic poles , the coverage is nearly continuous because the satellite sees the poles on every orbit . )",
    "w1 and w2 data from the original mission have a time baseline of six months for the 80% of the sky covered twice and a full year for the remaining 20% that was covered three times .",
    "both the @xcite motion survey and the @xcite motion survey ( the latter hereafter referred to as the `` allwise1 motion survey '' , or just `` allwise1 '' ) used this same underlying data set from the original _ wise _ mission .",
    "the @xcite survey started with source extractions on single exposure images from the _ wise _ all - sky , 3-band cryo , and post - cryo releases .",
    "the individual astrometric measurements were combined by @xcite into per - epoch measurements to identify objects with significant motion over the time baseline .",
    "the entire sky was searched except for small areas near both ecliptic poles totaling only @xmath320 sq .",
    ". a total of 762 motion objects , not cataloged before , were uncovered .    the allwise1 motion survey ,",
    "on the other hand , started with sources detected during allwise processing and tabulated in the allwise source catalog and allwise reject table ( @xcite ) .",
    "these source detections , from coadds comprised of many individual frames , were then measured on the frame stack itself . at the position of each detection ,",
    "a point spread function ( psf ) fit was performed to measure the source position and flux via a @xmath5 minimization procedure .",
    "the measurement model for source position included linear motion terms in ra and dec that could either be set to zero ( the `` stationary fit '' ) or fit fully ( the `` motion fit '' ) .",
    "the stationary fit was performed first , and the full set of photometric parameters was computed .",
    "then the motion fit was performed , using the position from the `` stationary fit '' as its initial position estimate .",
    "the @xmath5 minimization procedure then measured the motion of the object over the frame stack .",
    "these tabulated measures were used to search for objects of significant motion , as described in @xcite .",
    "the allwise1 motion survey covered the full sky and produced 3,525 new motion discoveries along with 16,683 re - discoveries ( see section  [ uncovered_objects ] ) .",
    "another _ wise_-based survey , combining data from the original _ wise _ mission with data from the first sky pass of the neowise 2015 data release ( @xcite ) , uses essentially the same methodology employed by @xcite .",
    "this survey , by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as the `` neowise reactivation motion survey '' , or just `` neowiser '' ) , leverages a longer baseline than the previous _ wise_-based searches  namely , @xmath33.75 years2010.5 . ] as opposed to the 0.5 - 1.0 year baseline available for the allwise1 and @xcite surveys . because the first sky pass contained in the 2015 data release",
    "was interrupted by a nineteen - day spacecraft safing operation , the neowiser motion survey covers @xmath390% of the sky only .",
    "the neowiser survey uncovered 1,006 new motion objects along with 19,542 re - discoveries .    because the allwise source catalog still contains many valid motion sources untapped by the original allwise1 motion survey , our team performed a second motion search of the allwise data , presented here .",
    "this survey is hereafter referred to as the `` allwise2 motion survey '' or just `` allwise2 '' .",
    "the essence of the scientific method is to observe nature , make a testable hypothesis to explain the observations , perform experiments to test the theory , analyze the results , revise the hypothesis if necessary , and repeat . after myriad cycles of this process",
    ", scientific methodology helps us develop general theories while allowing us to build an understanding of our surroundings with increasingly greater detail .",
    "each scientific discipline has its own mechanisms for achieving this .",
    "a chemist , for example , might use earlier observations and tested theory to hypothesize what the chemical reaction between two newly created compounds might be . to test this ,",
    "the chemist need only mix the compounds and observe the result . in this case",
    ", the experiment is a tactile process ; the chemist is an active participant .",
    "astronomy , on the other hand , is generally quite different . unlike chemists , astronomers have their hands figuratively tied behind their backs .",
    "they are unable to force the experiment .",
    "there is no picking up of test tubes to bring chemicals into contact .",
    "the laboratory itself is even far removed  light minutes or light years away .",
    "the astronomer is left merely to _ witness _ , not participate .",
    "nevertheless , the cosmos is continually performing experiments all around us .",
    "the astronomer s challenge is in recognizing these experiments and realizing how they can be used in the scientific method .",
    "the satisfaction resulting from this forced ingenuity is , in fact , one of the joys of astronomical research .",
    "basic observations provide the insight needed to devise new experiments .",
    "it was @xcite who first showed that three bright stars ",
    "arcturus , sirius , and palilicium ( known now as aldebaran )  exhibited their own , small motions across the sky , as shown by the fact that their positions had changed dramatically with respect to other stars since the measurements made by timocharis , aristyllus , hipparchus , and claudius ptolemy 1600 - 1800 years previously .",
    "however , it was not until @xcite concluded that the motion of such objects may indicate proximity to the sun that astronomers realized they had a new tool for distinguishing the nearest stars from the countless points of light in the background .",
    "thereafter , surveys began in earnest to search for proper motion objects whose distances might be measurable through a tool that the earth s yearly orbit about the sun provides us : trigonometric parallax ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "modern astronomy owes its underpinnings to the successes of these early motion surveys  from the establishment of the bottom rungs of the `` distance ladder '' ( e.g. , convergent point analysis of the hyades cluster ; @xcite ) to the discovery of degenerate states of matter ( via the identification of hot but very low luminosity stars now known as white dwarfs ; @xcite ) .    by performing the allwise2 motion survey",
    ", we continue this time - honored tradition .",
    "in allwise2 we identify nearby objects useful as `` test particles '' for various experiments :    * in one experiment , we identify motion stars located within or behind nearby molecular clouds . as these stars move , their flux variations along the line of sight can probe the clumpiness of the cloud material itself since the stars have spectral types appropriate for use as standard candles ( section  [ early_types ] ) .",
    "* in a second experiment , we select spectroscopically verified m dwarfs from our follow - up list to hunt for previously missed young objects in the solar vicinity . in this case , we use positional alignments of our motion sources with detections by x - ray and ultraviolet all - sky surveys to identify candidates with high levels of magnetic activity , which can often be tied to youth ( section  [ young_mdwarfs ] ) .",
    "young m dwarfs sometimes host young , low - mass brown dwarf companions that can be used as proxies for exoplanet atmospheric studies . * in a third experiment , we search for objects having both unusual colors and higher - than - average motions for their brightness to identify old , low - metallicty late - m and l ( sub)dwarfs .",
    "the identification of a large collection of such objects spanning the stellar / substellar break will eventually allow us to measure directly the brown dwarf cooling rates at very old ages ( section  [ subdwarf_analysis ] ) .",
    "* in a fourth experiment , we search for widely separated common - proper motion binaries having vastly different spectral types in order to constrain physical parameters of the system ( section 5 ) .",
    "as one example , we identify a system consisting of a normal m subdwarf and a carbon dwarf .",
    "the metallicity of the carbon dwarf , presumably polluted by a close but unseen white dwarf neighbor , can be measured directly using the metallicity of the m subdwarf companion , the first such system where this is possible ( section  [ carbon_dwarfs ] and section  [ serendipitous_systems ] ) .",
    "* in a fifth experiment , we look for outliers in color - color space to identify unresolved proper motion systems with disparate types . in one example , discussed in fajardo - acosta et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , an examination of the infrared colors led to the discovery of what we believe is a cold and unique white dwarf member in an unresolved system with a late - m dwarf . * in a sixth experiment , discussed in kellogg et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    ", we comb our list of motion candidates for objects detected by _",
    "wise _ but not by surveys at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the goal is to uncover other very cold brown dwarfs , such as the 250k object wisea j085510.74@xmath6071442.5 ( @xcite ) , that might have escaped color selection techniques .",
    "these cold atmospheres provide much needed empirical data points in the temperature regime just hotter than jupiter ( t@xmath7135k ; @xcite ) .      this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our new motion search using allwise and show a number of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams to aid in the characterization of the motion sources . in section 3",
    "we describe our spectroscopic observations and reductions on selected objects . in section 4",
    "we discuss spectral classification and analysis on the resulting spectra , divided into subsections by type : white dwarfs ( section 4.1 ) , stars with types @xmath8k5 ( section 4.2 ) , mid - k through late - m dwarfs ( section 4.3 ) , l dwarfs ( section 4.4 ) , t dwarfs ( section 4.5 ) , and subdwarfs ( section 4.6 ) . in section 5",
    "we discuss the search for common - proper - motion systems , with special emphasis on systems having l or t dwarf members ( section 5.1 ) , systems with white dwarf members ( section 5.2 ) , systems with large magnitude differences ( section 5.3 ) , and systems identified serendipitously ( section 5.4 ) .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "section 5 of @xcite shows that 80% of the objects found by @xcite but missed by the allwise1 motion survey were lost because of the criterion @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the reduced @xmath5 value for the stationary fit and @xmath11 is the reduced @xmath5 value for the motion fit .",
    "this criterion was used by allwise1 under the assumption that the reduced @xmath5 value would be significantly lower for the motion fit relative to the stationary fit if the object were truly moving . for the allwise2 motion survey",
    ", we have used the same criteria used for allwise1  discussed in section 4.1 of @xcite  except that the reduced @xmath5 criterion has been changed to @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the combination of allwise1 and allwise2 drops the @xmath13 check entirely .    an unfortunate consequence of this new criterion , and the reason it was not implemented originally , is the large number of new candidates it produces  another 1,409,845 of them .",
    "to scrutinize these , we created finder charts showing a 2@xmath142-arcmin region around each candidate s allwise coordinates as imaged by _ wise _ ( in the w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 bands ) and by previous large - area surveys : the digitized sky survey 1 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands ) , the digitized sky survey 2 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 bands ) , the two micron all sky survey ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 bands ) , and , when available , the sloan digital sky survey ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands ) . see figure  [ finder_chart ] as an example .",
    "after scrutinzing the first 491,031 charts , sampling different galactic environments covering 35.8% of the sky , we found that only 2.2% of the candidates were valid motion objects .",
    "this accrued knowledge allowed us to create additional criteria to further winnow the remaining candidate list .",
    "objects were removed from further consideration if an object from the usno - b1 catalog ( @xcite ) was found within 1 arcsec of the candidate s allwise position _ or _ if both @xmath26 and @xmath27 fall below 0.8 .",
    "the first criterion was imposed because many spurious candidates were found to be either not moving at all between usno - b1 and _ wise _ or were barely moving objects whose motions were overestimated in allwise .",
    "( the @xmath310-yr time baseline between the usno - b1 proper moved positions and the allwise positions means that this criterion eliminates any legitimate motion objects with @xmath28 arcsec / yr . ) the second criterion was imposed to eliminate false source detections from allwise : @xmath29 and @xmath30 give the number of individual exposures on which the source was detected with the profile - fit measurement in band w1 and w2 , respectively , whereas @xmath31 and @xmath32 give the total number of individual exposures available in bands w1 and w2 .",
    "spurious sources occurring in just a handful of frames are readily tossed out if both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are significantly less than 1 .",
    "running these additional criteria on the original list of 1,409,845 candidates reduces the list to 333,345 objects .",
    "these criteria were then run on the 35.8% of the sky already scrutinized to see how many valid motion objects would be erroneously eliminated . only fifty - four of",
    "the 10,598 confirmed motion objects ( 0.5% of the total ) were rejected by the additional criteria .",
    "these sources are listed in table  [ valid_motions_tossed ] . ] .",
    "of these fifty - four , fifty - one were rejected because they had a usno - b1 source lying within 1 arcsec , but this source is a non - moving background object that nearly coincides with the position of the _ wise _ source . in these cases ,",
    "the usno - b1 criterion has unfortunately eliminated a valid motion object . for the remaining three objects ( wise 1222@xmath65629 , wise 2046 + 3358 , and wise 2245 + 3026)ddmm . ] , both of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 values fall below 0.8 .",
    "all three of these are very bright , heavily saturated sources",
    " w1 magnitudes of 3.9 , @xmath61.8 , and 4.0 mag , respectively  and their low @xmath26 and @xmath27 values are indicative of the fact that very few usable pixels were available for the profile - fit measurement .",
    "the mean coverage per pixel was less than 7 for these objects , so measurements were not possible with @xmath280% frequency .",

    "<S> we use the allwise data release to continue our search for _ wise_-detected motions . in this paper , we publish another 27,846 motion objects , bringing the total number to 48,000 when objects found during our original allwise motion survey are included . </S>",
    "<S> we use this list , along with the lists of confirmed _ wise_-based motion objects from the recent papers by luhman and by schneider et al .  and candidate motion objects from the recent paper by gagn et al .  to search for widely separated , common - proper - motion systems . </S>",
    "<S> we identify 1,039 such candidate systems . </S>",
    "<S> all 48,000 objects are further analyzed using color - color and color - mag plots to provide possible characterizations prior to spectroscopic follow - up . </S>",
    "<S> we present spectra of 172 of these , supplemented with new spectra of 23 comparison objects from the literature , and provide classifications and physical interpretations of interesting sources . </S>",
    "<S> highlights include : ( 1 ) the identification of three g / k dwarfs that can be used as standard candles to study clumpiness and grain size in nearby molecular clouds because these objects are currently moving behind the clouds , ( 2 ) the confirmation / discovery of several m , l , and t dwarfs and one white dwarf whose spectrophotometric distance estimates place them 5 - 20 pc from the sun , ( 3 ) the suggestion that the ` d ' line be used as a diagnostic tool for interpreting and classifying metal - poor late - m and l dwarfs , ( 4 ) the recognition of a triple system including a carbon dwarf and late - m subdwarf , for which model fits of the late - m subdwarf ( giving [ fe / h]@xmath01.0 ) provide a measured metallicity for the carbon star , and ( 5 ) a possible 24-pc - distant k5 dwarf + peculiar red l5 system with an apparent physical separation of 0.1 pc .    </S>",
