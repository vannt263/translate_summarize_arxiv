    "in hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , large galaxies like the milky way and m31 form from the merger and accretion of smaller systems . such models , while successful at large scales , predict at least 1  2 orders of magnitude more low - mass dark subhalos at the present epoch than the observed abundance of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy , the `` missing satellite '' problem , is one of the most serious obstacles for matching cdm theory to observations .",
    "a number of solutions have been proposed to address the problem , at least qualitatively .",
    "star formation in low mass subsystems could be inhibited ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that the observed satellites are in fact embedded in much larger , more massive dark subhalos @xcite , or originally formed in more massive subhalos that were later tidally stripped @xcite , and that we are therefore observationally sampling a less populous region of the initial satellite mass function .",
    "all of these solutions aim to resolve the discrepancy between theory and observation by creating models which predict fewer directly observable satellites",
    ". a complementary observational approach would be to place more stringent constraints on the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function , but attempts to do so are hampered by the low surface brightnesses expected of galaxies in that regime .",
    "the advent of wide - field ccd surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has made it possible to detect stellar structures with extremely low surface brightnesses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the past two years data from sdss have been used to find two new local group members , andromeda ix ( and  ix ; * ? ? ? * ) and ursa major @xcite , satellites of m31 and the milky way , respectively ; at the time of its discovery , each of these two objects was determined to be the least luminous , lowest surface brightness galaxy found up to that point .    since the discovery of and  ix , we have been using sdss photometry of m31 and its surroundings to select fields for deeper observations on other telescopes , in order to search for additional m31 companions . in this letter , we report the discovery , using sdss and followup photometric data , of a new dwarf spheroidal companion to m31 , one which appears comparable in luminosity to and  ix .",
    "keck spectroscopy of stars in the field of this new satellite , and the kinematic and abundance information derived therefrom , are presented in a companion paper @xcite . for this work ,",
    "we have assumed a distance to m31 of 783kpc ( @xmath5 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sdss @xcite is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that has mapped @xmath6 of the sky .",
    "imaging data in the five sdss bandpasses ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are processed through pipelines to measure photometric and astrometric properties @xcite and to select targets for spectroscopic followup .",
    "the sdss scan used in this work was carried out on 5 october 2002 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , processed with the same pipeline as data release 1 @xcite , and spans @xmath8 along the major axis of m31 . for dereddening and conversion from sdss magnitudes to @xmath9 magnitudes , we use @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    by selecting stars in the sdss m31 scan with colors and magnitudes characteristic of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars at the distance of m31",
    ", we discovered and  ix , a new dwarf spheroidal satellite of m31 @xcite . owing to their low metallicity @xcite",
    ", the rgb stars in and  ix  are relatively blue ; limiting our photometric criteria to select _ blue _ rgb stars at the distance of m31 , a large number of additional , less prominent overdensities were revealed .",
    "it is important to note that these stellar overdensities are not directly visible in sdss images ( see , e.g. , fig.[fig : sdss_wht]a ) , and are only detected as enhancements of the spatial density of stars within a specific color - magnitude bin ( fig.[fig : sdss_wht]b ) ; in sdss data , such enhancements may consist of a few stars spread across several square arcminutes .",
    "deeper followup observations are therefore required in order to determine the nature of these overdensities , in particular to ascertain if they represent new m31 satellites .    in the autumn of 2004",
    ", we used the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) and 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma to image targets selected from these sdss stellar overdensities .",
    "we observed at the wht the nights of 14 and 15 september 2004 , using the prime focus imaging camera ( pfip ) with harris @xmath10 filters .",
    "unfortunately , we were only able to obtain short integrations of one of the satellite candidates under suitable observing conditions ( seeing @xmath11 ) .",
    "the wht images were reduced with standard iraf tasks , and daophot ii / allstar @xcite was used to obtain @xmath12 and @xmath13 photometry , which we bootstrap - calibrated with sdss data .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss_wht]c shows the resulting dereddened @xmath14 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , for stars in a circular @xmath15-radius region centered on the location of the satellite candidate . despite significant field contamination , an rgb is visible . subtracting the area - scaled cmd of an outer control region yields the hess diagram in figure [ fig : sdss_wht]d .",
    "the narrowness , shape , and color of the rgb indicate the presence of a spatially distinct , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ) stellar population at roughly the distance of m31 ( the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) appears to be at @xmath17 ) , similar to that of and  ix @xcite .",
    "the additional similarities between the observed candidate and and  ix , with regard to low surface brightness ( i.e. , no obvious unresolved luminous component ) and size ( @xmath18 few arcminutes ) , are further indications that the object is a new dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite of m31 ; we have therefore given it the name andromeda x ( and  x ) .    during our subsequent run at the not ( 6  11 october 2004 ) , we used the mosaic camera ( mosca ) and sdss @xmath19 filters to obtain deeper imaging of this candidate with excellent seeing ( typically @xmath20 ) .",
    "we used the same reduction and analysis tasks to obtain sdss - calibrated @xmath19 photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : notimg ] shows the coaddition of the not @xmath21 imaging data , in which and  x is revealed as an elliptical stellar overdensity ( oriented roughly ne  sw ) at the center .",
    "the superior depth and resolution of the not data are evident in the resulting cmds of the central @xmath15-radius region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : notcmds]a and d ) , in which and  x s narrow , blue rgb clearly stands out .",
    "the background - subtracted dereddened hess diagrams ( figs.[fig : notcmds]c and f ) are overplotted with the dereddened sdss cmd of ngc  2419 , a galactic globular cluster ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 ) , shifted to a distance modulus of 24.24 ( see  [ txt : props ] ) ; given the uncertainties in both and  x s distance and reddening , the agreement between and  x and ngc  2419 is remarkable , even hinting at the possible presence of blue horizontal branch stars in the @xmath23 cmd , and provides further evidence for and  x s low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath24 ) .",
    "cm    -0.5 cm",
    "using background - subtracted photometric data from the not observations , we constructed a spatial density map of probable and  x members in radial bins of @xmath25 , to which we fit two - dimensional @xcite and @xcite profiles .",
    "we then applied the techniques of @xcite to the not @xmath21 images , masking foreground stars and subtracting a fitted sky level , binning the resulting data in circular annuli to measure the central surface brightness and total magnitude in each filter .",
    "no unresolved luminous component was detected in and  x , so we used the method of @xcite to estimate the total surface brightness and luminosity by comparison with sdss observations of the pegasus dirr ; comparison to the luminosity function of the draco dsph @xcite confirms that these estimates are reasonable for a range of stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the undereddened central surface brighnesses derived for and  x in this way are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively ( @xmath32 in @xmath12 ) ; the measured total magnitudes in @xmath21 are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 in @xmath12 ) .",
    "table [ tbl : pars ] lists the derived structural parameters and dereddened @xmath12-band magnitudes for and  ix and and  x.    determining a more precise distance to and  x with the data in hand is problematic , due to the sparseness of and  x s cmd in the region of the trgb .",
    "we closely examined the field - star - subtracted @xmath13-band stellar luminosity functions derived from both wht and not data within the central @xmath15 radius of and  x ; however , even convolution with an edge detection kernel did not yield an unambiguous trgb magnitude , with the measured @xmath37 ranging from approximately @xmath38 to @xmath39 , after correction for a foreground reddening of @xmath40 . assuming a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath41 and a trgb color of @xmath42 ( as for and  ix ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from the calibration of @xcite we obtain the relation @xmath43 , yielding a distance modulus range of @xmath44 to @xmath45 , with uncertainties on the order of @xmath46 mag ( @xmath47 kpc to @xmath48 kpc , @xmath49 to @xmath50 kpc ) . at an m31 distance of 783 kpc , the angular separation of and  x from the center of m31 , @xmath51 ,",
    "gives a projected separation of @xmath52 kpc ; considering the above range of and  x distance estimates puts and  x at @xmath53 kpc to @xmath54 kpc from the center of m31 , well within m31 s estimated virial radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radius at which m31 halo stars have been found @xcite .",
    "thus and  x is in all likelihood a bound satellite of m31 , with a dereddened integrated magnitude of @xmath2 , translating to an absolute magnitude of @xmath55 .",

    "as shown in table [ tbl : pars ] , and  x is comparable in size , surface brightness , and apparent magnitude to and  ix , and , despite the uncertainty in its distance , and  x appears to be somewhat lower in luminosity ( @xmath79 ) . we conclude that and  x is a new extremely low luminosity dsph companion of m31 , a result confirmed by kinematic data @xcite . the earlier discovery of and  ix raised the question of whether such low luminosity galaxies were a rarity in the local group , or if and  ix represented the tip of an iceberg , one of a large population of faint dwarf satellites that have remained undetected owing to their extremely low surface brightnesses and low luminosities . and",
    "x s discovery , in conjunction with the recent discovery of the ursa major dwarf @xcite , strongly suggests that the latter scenario is closer to the truth  that m31 and the milky way may in fact have a large number of low luminosity satellites .    further analysis of sdss data is therefore likely to yield more such dwarfs . to test this scenario ,",
    "we are following up other stellar overdensities in the sdss m31 scan with deeper observations on other telescopes .",
    "intriguingly , in projection and  ix and and  x lie relatively close to each other and to the major axis of m31 , northeast of m31 s center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m31sats ] ) ; as more new m31 satellites are found ( as appears quite likely ) , we will be able to place constraints on the spatial distribution of m31 satellites and their ( an)isotropy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as on the satellite luminosity function .",
