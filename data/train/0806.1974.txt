    "an invariant probability measure @xmath0 ( for a map , or for a group action ) is said to be _ ergodic _ if every invariant measurable set is either of zero or full @xmath0-measure .",

    "the definition of ergodicity can be naturally extended to non necessarily invariant measures @xmath0 which are at least _ quasi - invariant _ , that is , such that @xmath1 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath0 for every element @xmath2 in the acting group .",

    "we say that @xmath0 is _ ergodic _ if for every measurable @xmath4-invariant subset @xmath5 either @xmath6    notice that the definition of ergodicity concerns both the action and the measure . however , for several actions an invariant ( or quasi - invariant ) measure is naturally defined .",
    "for instance , symplectic maps or hamiltonian flows and their restrictions to fixed energy levels have natural invariant measures , and for any @xmath7 diffeomorphism the lebesgue measure is quasi - invariant . in these situations ,",
    "one focuses on the action itself , and the ergodicity is always meant with respect to this natural measure .",
    "ergodicity can be thought of as a property involving some complexity for the orbits of the action coming from the fact that this action is irreducible from a measurable point of view .",
    "the topological counterpart to this notion corresponds to _ minimality _ :    a continuous action of a group @xmath4 on a topological space @xmath3 is said to be _ minimal _ if for every @xmath4-invariant closed subset @xmath5 either @xmath8 .",
    "equivalently , an action is minimal if all of its orbits are dense .",
    "it is natural to ask until what extend the properties of ergodicity and minimality are related . in one direction , it is easy to see that , in general , the former does not imply the latter . indeed , ergodicity concerns the behavior of almost every point , and not of _ all _ the points .",
    "actually , one can easily construct examples of ergodic group actions having global fixed points .",
    "the question in the opposite direction is more interesting :    under what conditions a smooth action of a group on a compact manifold is necessarily lebesgue - ergodic ?",
    "the following widely known conjecture concerns the one - dimensional case of this question .",
    "the main result of this work , namely theorem  [ description ] later on , allows to solve it in the affirmative under some additional assumptions that seem to us interesting and sufficiently mild .",

    "[ conj ]    conjecture  [ conj ] has been answered by the affirmative in many cases by the exponential expansion strategy ( largely going back to d. sullivan ) .",

    "actually , the ergodicity of minimal @xmath25 actions satisfying the latter condition was proved earlier in  @xcite .",
    "all of this serves as a good motivation for the following    a point @xmath26 is said to be _ non - expandable _ if for all @xmath23 one has @xmath27 .",
    "one should immediately point out that the presence of non - expandable points does not contradict the minimality .",
    "for instance , the canonical action of the modular group @xmath28 on @xmath29 is minimal , but the points @xmath30 and @xmath31 are non - expandable ( see section [ ss : psl-2-z ] ) .",

    "as a consequence , the ergodicity for the smooth minimal actions of  @xmath32 on the circle can not be deduced from katok - herman s result discussed in section  [ ss : minimality].[f : g - s - rational ] ] for this ( minimal ) action ( that we recall in section  [ ss : thompson ] ) we prove the following    [ thompson ] the @xmath34-set for the minimal ghys - sergiescu s action of thompson group t consists of a single point , which is an isolated fixed point of an element .",

    "this function would then descend to the quotient @xmath58 , which is the modular surface .",

    "the non - atomic conformal measures supported on the minimal invariant set ( the whole circle or  @xmath59 , respectively ) are ergodic .    as a final remark",
    "let us point out that , quite surprisingly , there exist examples of conformal measures on the circle whose conformal exponent exceeds one ( that is , the dimension of the circle ) . these examples illustrate the restrictions imposed in theorem  [ conformalstar ] :    [ ex : gs ] there exists a ghys - sergiescu s non - minimal @xmath45 action on the circle of the thompson group  @xmath32 such that , for every @xmath85 , there exists a conformal measure of exponent  @xmath65 concentrated on the endpoints of the complementary intervals of the minimal set .",

    "another concept related to the study of group actions is that of random dynamics .",
    "namely , if in addition to an action of a group  @xmath4 on a compact space  @xmath3 is given a measure @xmath87 on @xmath4 , then one can consider the left random walk on  @xmath4 generated by @xmath87 , and the corresponding random process on  @xmath3 .",

    "the images @xmath90 of a given initial point @xmath91 can be then considered as its `` random iterates '' , as one has @xmath92 .",
    "associated to this concept there is the following    a measure  @xmath93 on @xmath3 is _ stationary with respect to @xmath87 _ if it coincides with the average of its images , that is , for every borel @xmath94 , @xmath95    this widely studied notion is in some sense analogous to that of an invariant measure for single maps .",
    "for instance , the existence of a stationary measure may be deduced by the classical krylov - bogolubov procedure of time averaging ; moreover , an analogue of the birkhoff ergodic theorem holds  we recall more details on this in section  [ s : background ] .    if for an action on the circle the first @xmath96-moment-@xmath96-moment , as we are taking the logarithm of the @xmath96-norm , in order to deal with a composition - subadditive number",

    "@xmath97 of the measure  @xmath87 is finite , one can also define a _ random lyapunov exponent _ with respect to an ergodic stationary measure .",
    "if the support @xmath98 does not preserve any measure on the circle , a result of p.  baxendale  @xcite ensures the existence of an ergodic stationary measure whose random lyapunov exponent is negative ( which corresponds to some kind of a local contraction by random compositions ) .    using the negativity of the random lyapunov exponent , and somehow reversing the time of the dynamics , we obtain the following result relating the stationary measures to the lyapunov expansion exponent of individual points .    [ thm : positive ] let @xmath4 be a group of @xmath7 circle diffeomorphisms , and let @xmath87 be a measure on  @xmath4 having finite first word - moment .",

    "then there exists a @xmath87-stationary measure  @xmath93 such that the lyapunov expansion exponent is positive at @xmath93-almost every point .",
    "this result turns out to be interesting for the study of the question of the regularity of the stationary measure that we explain below .",
    "namely , quite often the stationary measure turns out to be unique .",
    "more precisely , the local contraction , coming from the negativity of the random lyapunov exponent of some stationary measure  @xmath93 , enables to prove the uniqueness of the stationary measure in the basin of attraction of  @xmath93 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this provides the uniqueness of the stationary measure in the case where , in addition to the absence of a @xmath98-invariant measure , either the support  @xmath98 generates the whole group  @xmath4 , or the action on the circle of the semigroup generated by  @xmath98 is minimal .",
    "we recall the precise definitions and statements of these results later in section  [ ss : random ] .",
    "now , in the case of uniqueness of the stationary measure , the latter is either absolutely continuous , or singular with respect to the lebesgue measure ( as both the absolutely continuous and the singular parts would be stationary ) .",
    "this dichotomy is at the origin of very interesting problems ; in particular , there is the following conjecture , that we learned from y.  guivarch , v.  kaimanovich , and f.  ledrappier :    [ conj3 ] for any finitely supported measure @xmath87 on a lattice @xmath99 whose support generates  @xmath100 , the corresponding stationary measure on the circle is singular .",

    "in this direction our theorem  [ thm : positive ] provides the following    [ c : sing ] assume that the lyapunov expansion exponent for a finitely generated group  @xmath4 of @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms is equal to zero . then for any measure @xmath87 on  @xmath4 such that the corresponding stationary measure  @xmath93 is unique and non @xmath98-invariant , @xmath93 is singular with respect to the lebesgue one .    in particular , this holds for measures  @xmath87 with finite first word - moment , without @xmath98-common invariant measures , and such that either the support @xmath98 generates  @xmath4 , or the semigroup generated by this support acts minimally on the circle .",

    "it may be checked that with a well chosen sequence of actions , one can ensure that the resulting action of the group @xmath127 is minimal , but it is non - ergodic and even non - conservative : there is a set of positive measure which is disjoint from all of its images by nontrivial elements of  @xmath4 .",
    "although this construction seems to be well known , we did nt find it in the literature , and for the reader s convenience we provide more details at the end of section  [ s : distortion ] .",
    "we point out , however , that there exists a simpler example ( due to d.  sullivan  @xcite ) of a non - ergodic , minimal , smooth group action on the circle without invariant measure .",
    "namely , fixing a cantor set @xmath128 of positive lebesgue measure , for each connected component @xmath129 of @xmath130 one chooses an hyperbolic reflection  @xmath131 with respect to the geodesic joining the endpoints of  @xmath129 .",
    "then the action of the group generated by the @xmath131 s is minimal ( this can be checked using the fact that every orbit intersects all the complementary intervals of @xmath59 , and thus accumulates everywhere on  @xmath59 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is non - ergodic ( and even non - conservative ) , since the set  @xmath59 of positive measure is disjoint from all of its nontrivial images .",
    "let us now consider the case of a subgroup  @xmath132 satisfying the hypotheses of conjecture  [ conj ] .",
    "we first point out that the ergodicity is a nontrivial issue even when  @xmath4 is generated by a single diffeomorphism .",
    "indeed , poincar s theorem implies that every minimal circle homeomorphism is topologically conjugate to an irrational rotation .",
    "however , for `` an essential part '' of the set of minimal diffeomorphisms the conjugating map appears to be singular , and therefore the ergodicity with respect to the lebesgue measure after conjugacy does not imply the ergodicity with respect to the lebesgue measure before it .",
    "nevertheless , the conjecture for this case has been settled independently by a.  katok for @xmath133 diffeomorphisms ( see for instance  @xcite ) and by m.  herman for @xmath134 diffeomorphisms ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , katok s proof uses arguments of control of distortion for the iterations that are based on the existence of decompositions of the circle into arcs which are almost permuted by the dynamics ( and which come from the good rational approximations of the rotation number ) .",
    "if  @xmath4 has no element with irrational rotation number , the result above can not be applied .",
    "however , in this case the dynamics has some hyperbolic behaviour . to show the ergodicity one",
    "then would like to apply the exponential expansion strategy .",
    "this classical procedure consists on expanding very small intervals which concentrate a good proportion of some invariant set , in such a way that the distortion ( see a precise definition in section  [ s : distortion ] ) of the compositions remains controlled .",
    "more precisely , the scheme works as follows .",
    "let @xmath135 be an invariant measurable subset of positive lebesgue measure . by lebesgue s theorem ,",
    "almost every point  @xmath136 is a density ( or lebesgue ) point , that is , @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the @xmath65-neighborhood of @xmath43 .",
    "now take @xmath139 such that the proportion of points of  @xmath56 in @xmath138 is very close to  @xmath82 .",
    "if one can expand this interval keeping a uniform bound for the distortion , then each one of the `` expanded '' intervals also has a proportion of points in  @xmath56 very close to  @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "since their length stay bounded away from zero , after passing to the limit along a sequence @xmath140 what we see is an interval in which the points in  @xmath56 form a subset of full relative measure .",
    "if the action is minimal , this implies that @xmath56 is a subset of full measure in the circle .",
    "the arguments that we have just cited were used by the third author in  @xcite as well as by s.  hurder in  @xcite for establishing their ergodicity results that we mentioned in the introduction : roughly speaking , if the expansion can be done `` sufficiently quickly '' , then minimal actions are necessarily ergodic .    for exceptional minimal sets ,",
    "the zero lebesgue measure conjecture was proven by the third author for the case where for each @xmath63 there exists @xmath141 such that @xmath142 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "later on , s.  hurder showed in  @xcite that the lebesgue measure of the intersection @xmath143 is equal to zero .",
    "also , the conjecture has been proved by cantwell and conlon in  @xcite for the case where the dynamics is  `` markovian '' .",
    "once again , both hypotheses of g.  hector conjecture  [ conj2 ] are essential , and one can construct counter - examples in the case where they are not satisfied ( see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite for the hypothesis concerning smoothness ) .",
    "random dynamical systems have been studied for a long time , and we are certainly unable to recall here all ( and even the main ) achievements of this theory .",
    "we shall then restrict ourselves to those that will be necessary for the exposition .",
    "first , we would like to recall that a random dynamics can be modeled in terms of a single map . indeed , consider the map @xmath144 which is a skew - product over the left shift on @xmath145 . in terms of this map , instead of saying that we consider random compositions of maps",
    ", we can say that we take a random point in @xmath145 , distributed with respect to  @xmath146 , and then we consider the iterations of @xmath118 on the fiber over this point .",
    "a direct computation then shows that a measure @xmath93 is @xmath87-stationary if and only if the measure @xmath147 is @xmath118-invariant .",
    "the latter remark allows to apply to the random dynamics all the arsenal of techniques from ergodic theory   krylov - bogolubov procedure ( implying the existence of stationary measures ) , birkhoff ergodic theorem ( ensuring the convergence of random time averages ) , etc .",
    "in particular , one can define lyapunov exponents for a smooth random dynamics on a compact manifold , provided that the first @xmath96-moment of @xmath87 is finite .",
    "we will not do this in a general situation , and we will restrict ourselves to the case of the dynamics on the circle . in this case , the _ random lyapunov exponent _ corresponding to a point  @xmath11 and to a sequence  @xmath148 is defined as the limit @xmath149 simple arguments show that , for a given measure  @xmath87 on  @xmath4 with finite first @xmath96-moment , and for any @xmath87-stationary ergodic measure  @xmath93 , the limit   is constant ( in particular , it exists ) almost everywhere w.r.t .",
    "the measure @xmath150 . by birkhoff",
    "ergodic theorem , this constant equals @xmath151 and we denote it by  @xmath152 .",
    "now , according to a general principle in one - dimensional dynamics , which has been developed in the work of many authors , for a random dynamics on the circle that does not preserve any measure , `` random compositions contract '' .",
    "in other words , under certain general assumptions ( for instance , the system should be supposed to be non - factorizable ) one can conclude that a long composition , most probably , will map almost all the circle ( except for a small interval ) into a small interval .",
    "equivalently , for any two given points of the circle , most probably their orbits along the same random sequence of compositions will approach each other .",
    "we would like to recall here the following results illustrating this principle . in his seminal work",
    "@xcite , h.  furstenberg proved the contraction statement for projective dynamics in arbitrary dimension ( in particular , on the circle ) . the work of v.a .",
    "antonov  @xcite established the contraction for any minimal and inverse - minimal non - factorizable random dynamics on the circle ( one can also find an exposition of this work in  @xcite ) . in his excellent work ,",
    "baxendale  @xcite studied the sum of the lyapunov exponents for a smooth random dynamics on a compact manifold of any dimension .",
    "more precisely , p.  baxendale proved that for such a dynamics , if the first @xmath96-moment is finite ( so that the random lyapunov exponents are well - defined ) and there is common invariant measure , there exists an ergodic stationary measure such that the sum of its lyapunov exponents ( which can be thought of as the exponential rate of volume changement ) is negative .",
    "in particular , for the circle ( as it is one - dimensional ) , this impies the negativity of the lyapunov exponent , which , in its turn ( due to the distortion control arguments ) implies local contraction by the random dynamics .    together with the results of v.a .",
    "antonov , the above result becomes a powerful tool for studying group dynamics on the circle .",
    "in particular , this was exploited by the authors in  @xcite , where they proved the ( global ) contraction property for a symmetric measure  @xmath87 ( in fact , the same arguments work if the support  @xmath98 generates the acting group as a semigroup ) .",
    "the global contraction property implies the uniqueness of the stationary measure ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if the contraction property holds only locally , then the stationary measure is still unique provided that the system is minimal .",
    "we must point out that the actions of thompson group  @xmath32 and of @xmath153 that we deal with in this article are ( up to some easy modifications ) the only minimal , smooth actions of non - abelian groups on the circle for which we know that @xmath154 .",
    "this motivates the following    [ q : star ] does every ( sufficiently smooth ) minimal action on the circle of a non - abelian finitely generated group satisfy property  ?",
    "both the positive or negative answer to this question would be interesting : the positive one would lead to an interesting general property of minimal actions on the circle , and the negative one would give an example of a `` monster '' , certainly having very strange properties .    according to theorems  [ thompson ] and  [ psl2z ] , for the actions of  @xmath32 and @xmath153 the corresponding lyapunov expansion exponents are zero .",
    "therefore , the following question makes sense :    [ q : l0 ] let @xmath4 be a finitely generated non - abelian group ( perhaps having property  ) of ( sufficiently smooth ) circle diffeomorphisms .",
    "if the action of @xmath4 is minimal and @xmath155 , is it necessarily true that @xmath22  ?",
    "once again , both the positive or negative answer to this question are interesting , the positive one leading to a general property , and the negative one providing us of an interesting and perhaps strange action .    a particular case of question  [ q : l0 ] , closely related to conjecture  [ conj3 ] , is the following one :    [ q : gamma ] is it true that for every non - cocompact lattice @xmath99 , the lyapunov expansion exponent of its action on the circle is zero ?",
    "a positive answer to this question looks very plausible . by joining it to our theorem  [ thm : positive ]",
    ", it would give another proof to the singularity theorem by y.  guivarch and y.  le jan cited in the introduction .",
    "in fact , adapting the arguments of the proof of theorem  [ psl2z ] ( and using some techniques from riemann surfaces theory ) , one can show that , for every lattice as above , its action on the circle satisfies the property  .",
    "moreover , the @xmath34-set turns out to be non - empty and corresponds in some precise sense to the set of cusps in the quotient surface .",
    "the proofs of these facts are , however , rather technical , and we do not give them here since this would overload the paper .    for the study of conformal measures , the results we stated in the introduction lead to many other questions that seem interesting to us .",
    "first , the fact that for a minimal dynamics the only non - atomic conformal measure is the lebesgue one , was proven only under the assumption of property  . in",
    "would be interesting to answer this question in general :    [ q : conformal ] is it true that for any minimal smooth action of a finitely generated group on the circle the only non - atomic conformal measure is the lebesgue one ?    by theorem  [ conformalstar ] , a positive answer to question  [ q : star ] would automatically imply a positive answer to question  [ q : conformal ] , but certainly the latter question can be attacked independently ( and perhaps will be simpler to handle via some other way ) .",
    "analogous questions , as well as several new ones , are interesting in presence of an exceptional minimal set : does every finitely generated action with an exceptional minimal set satisfy property  ?",
    "is it true that for every finitely generated group action ( not necessarily satisfying property  ) with an exceptional minimal set",
    "@xmath59 , there exists at most one non - atomic conformal measure supported on it ?",
    "does such a measure always ( or under the assumption of property  ) exist ?",
    "if yes , does it coincide with the normalized hausdorff measure ( which then will be non - vanishing and finite ) ?",
    "in the case of existence of such a measure , does its conformal exponent coincide with the the hausdorff dimension of the minimal set ?",
    "is it true that , in the general ( _ i.e. _ , minimal dynamics or exceptional minimal set ) situation , a conformal measure with exponent greater than one is atomic ?    to conclude this section , we would like to state a question due to  .",
    "ghys concerning the dichotomy between absolute continuity and singularity for stationary measures . to motivate this question , first notice that , in the examples of singular stationary measure for minimal actions that we have already mentioned ( thompson group  @xmath32 , non - cocompact lattices in  @xmath50 ) , the corresponding groups are generated by maps that are `` far '' from the identity .",
    "moreover , singular stationary measures naturally appear for ( expanding ) actions of fundamental groups of closed genus @xmath156 surfaces .",
    "indeed , to each conformal structure on such a surface corresponds an action of its fundamental group on the circle ( viewed as the boundary of its universal cover , _",
    "i.e. _ the poincar disc ) . through the actions corresponding to different complex structures are topologically conjugate",
    ", the conjugating map is always singular .",
    "thus , among the stationary measures corresponding to different structures ( for the same probability distribution on the group ) , at most one is absolutely continuous .",
    "notice however that , once again , these groups are generated by maps that are `` far '' from the identity . in another direction , a result due to j.  rebelo  @xcite asserts that topological conjugacies between non - solvable groups of circle diffeomorphisms generated by elements _ near the identity _ are absolutely continuous .",
    "thus , the above methods for obtaining a singular stationary measure stop working if we restrict ourselves to such actions .",
    "due to all of this , it is interesting to find out if there are examples of singular stationary measures for actions generated by maps close to the identity :    let @xmath4 be a non - abelian group of @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms without finite orbits and generated as a semigroup by finitely many elements close to rotations ( in the sense of  @xcite ) . if @xmath87 is any measure supported on this system of generators , is it necessarily true that the associated stationary measure on  @xmath157 is equivalent to the lebesgue measure ? is this true under the additional assumption that the set of generators and the distribution  @xmath87 are symmetric with respect to inversion ?",
    "it is interesting to notice that , under some assumptions , for analytic perturbations of the trivial system the equation for the density of the stationary measure admits at least a formal solution as a power series in the parameter .",
    "we begin this section by recalling several lemmas concerning control of distortion which are classical in the context of smooth one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "a more detailed discussion may be found , for instance , in  @xcite , and in many of the references therein .",
    "therefore , we will not enter into the technical details of their proofs here , and we will just briefly describe the ideas .",
    "we begin with a general definition .    given two intervals @xmath158 and a @xmath7 map @xmath159 which is a diffeomorphism onto its image , we define the _ distortion coefficient _ of @xmath118 on  @xmath129 by @xmath160 and its _ distortion norm _ by @xmath161    it is easy to check that the distortion coefficient is subadditive under composition .",
    "moreover , by lagrange theorem , one has @xmath162 where the constant @xmath163 depends only on the @xmath164-norm of  @xmath118 ( indeed , one can take @xmath163 as being the maximum of the absolute value of the derivative of the function @xmath165 ) .",
    "this implies immediately the following    [ p : sum ] let @xmath14 be a subset of @xmath46 which is bounded with respect to the @xmath164-norm . if @xmath129 is an interval on the circle and @xmath166 are finitely many elements chosen from @xmath18 , then @xmath167 where the constant @xmath168 depends only on the set  @xmath18 .    in other words ,",
    "if we compose several `` relatively simple '' maps , then a bound for the sum of the lengths of the successive images of an interval @xmath129 provides a control for the distortion of the whole composition over @xmath129 .",
    "using this fact one can show the following    [ cor : estimates ] under the assumptions of proposition  [ p : sum ] , let us fix a point @xmath169 , and let us denote @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 then the following inequalities hold : @xmath173 @xmath174    notice that the sum in the exponential in   goes up to @xmath175 , while the sum of the lengths in the left hand side expression goes up to  @xmath105 .",
    "using an induction argument , this seemingly innocuous remark appears to be fundamental for establishing the following    [ bound ] under the assumptions of proposition  [ p : sum ] , given a point @xmath176 let us denote @xmath177 .",
    "then for every @xmath178 one has @xmath179    as a consequence , if the sum of the derivatives is not too big , then up to a multiplicative constant one can approximate the length of the image interval in proposition  [ p : sum ] by the length of the initial interval @xmath129 times the derivative of the composition at a given point in @xmath129 .",
    "this simple fact allows us already to prove the conservativity of conformal measures .",
    "let @xmath14 be a finite family of generators of @xmath4 as a semi - group .",
    "suppose that there exists a borel subset @xmath56 of the circle such that @xmath72 , and @xmath180 for every nontrivial element @xmath141 .",
    "this immediately yields @xmath181 for every @xmath182 in @xmath4 , which gives @xmath183 therefore , for @xmath0-almost every point @xmath136 , the sum @xmath184 converges , and since @xmath79 the same holds for the sum @xmath185 .",
    "let us fix one of these points  @xmath186 , also belonging to the minimal set @xmath59 ( we can do this , as the measure  @xmath0 is concentrated on @xmath59 ) , and let @xmath129 be an open neighborhood centered at @xmath186 having length strictly smaller than @xmath187 .",
    "we claim that for every @xmath188 , and every @xmath189 , one has @xmath190 .",
    "indeed , this follows directly from proposition  [ bound ] by writing @xmath2 as a product of generators .",
    "now the above implies that the @xmath0-measure of the set @xmath191 is smaller than or equal to @xmath192 since @xmath0 is non - atomic , if @xmath129 is chosen small enough , then the value of this expression is strictly smaller than  @xmath82 .",
    "if this is the case , the complementary set of  @xmath66 is of positive @xmath0-measure , and hence intersects  @xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath66 is an open @xmath4-invariant set containing @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , @xmath194 is a nonempty closed invariant set , strictly containted in  @xmath59 , and this contradicts the minimality of  @xmath59 .    as we have seen in the introduction , d.  sullivan theorem  [ thm : conservativity ] is no longer true for non finitely generated groups of circle diffeomorphisms acting minimaly . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we provide below the details of the already mentioned example of a non finitely generated abelian group of circle diffeomorphisms whose action is minimal but non - conservative .",
    "the construction works by induction .",
    "fix a dense sequence of points @xmath195 in @xmath157 .",
    "let @xmath196 the euclidean rotation of order  2 , and assume that for an integer @xmath197 a generator @xmath198 of @xmath199 has been already constructed .",
    "let @xmath200 be the @xmath201-fold covering map induced by @xmath198 .",
    "for @xmath202 small enough , the set @xmath203 is formed by @xmath204 disjoint intervals , and the lengths of these intervals tend to zero as @xmath205 goes to zero .",
    "let us enumerate these intervals ( modulo @xmath204 and respecting their cyclic order on @xmath157 ) by @xmath206 , and let us denote by @xmath207 the maximal open interval to the right of @xmath208 contained in the complementary set of the union of the @xmath209 s .",

    "@xmath212 ) , by appropriately lifting from the quotient @xmath213 a diffeomorphism that interchanges @xmath214 and its complementary .    notice that every @xmath211-orbit intersects the interval @xmath215 .",
    "it is not difficult to deduce from this that , if the sequence @xmath205 tends to zero as @xmath105 goes to infinity , then the action of @xmath216 is minimal . to ensure the non - conservativity we choose @xmath205",
    "sufficiently small so that @xmath217 and we define a decreasing sequence of sets @xmath218 , each of which is disjoint from its nontrivial @xmath211-images , by @xmath219 by construction , the intersection @xmath220 is a ( measurable ) set which is disjoint from all of its images under nontrivial elements in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath221 this shows that the action is non - conservative .    to close this section",
    "we would like to point out that , to the best of our knowledge , the only examples of minimal non - ergodic group actions by @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms that there exist in the literature are constructed by prescribing a positive measure set which is disjoint from all of its images ( _ i.e. _ , they are actually non - conservative ) .",
    "this motivates the following    is every minimal and conservative action of a ( non finitely generated ) group by @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms necessarily ergodic ?",
    "notice that the minimal non - ergodic examples using quas construction that we mentioned in the introduction are based on a different idea . however , these actions seem to be non @xmath45 smoothable ( in many cases this follows from our theorem  [ description ] ) .",
    "recall that thompson group  t is the group of circle homeomorphisms which are piecewise linear in such a way that all the break points , as well as their images , are dyadic rational numbers , and which induce a bijection of the set of dyadic rationals ( notice that these properties force the derivatives on the linearity intervals to be integer powers of  @xmath222 ) .    as  .",
    "ghys and v.  sergiescu have cleverly noticed in @xcite , the dynamics of this group is somehow `` generated '' by a single ( non invertible ) map , namely @xmath223 .",
    "indeed , @xmath224 has a ( unique ) fixed point @xmath225 whose preorbit is exactly the set of dyadic rationals , and thompson group  @xmath32 is the set of homeomorphisms obtained by gluing finitely maps of the form @xmath226 at some dyadic rationals ( here , for @xmath227 one can choose any of the corresponding @xmath228 branches ) .",
    "the main argument of the construction in  @xcite consists in replacing @xmath224 by another degree - two smooth monotonous map @xmath229 fixing the point @xmath225 and being sufficiently tangent to the identity at this point .",
    "one can then define the set of `` @xmath229-dyadically rational '' points as the @xmath229-preorbit of  @xmath51 , and one can make correspond , to each element @xmath230 , the map @xmath231_{\\varphi}$ ] which is obtained by gluing ( in a coherent way ) the branches of @xmath232 instead of @xmath226 at the corresponding @xmath229-dyadically rational points .",
    "the issue here is that , since  @xmath229 is tangent to the identity at  @xmath51 , the maps obtained after gluing are smooth ( actually , as smooth as the order of the tangency is ) .",

    "_ starting with @xmath554 we let @xmath555 where the elements @xmath556 ( chosen using lemma  [ l : one - step ] ) satisfy @xmath557 if we perform this procedure @xmath558 times , then for the compositions @xmath559 we obtain @xmath560    for estimating the quotient in the left hand side expression of  , we will write it differently .",
    "namely , letting @xmath561 , one can easily check that @xmath562 in other words , providing a control for the quotient in   corresponding to an expansion at @xmath43 is equivalent to providing a control for the sum of the derivatives for the contraction at @xmath305 .",
    "now , to simplify the notation , we will denote by @xmath563 the composition obtained at each step of the expansion procedure , that is , @xmath564 if we denote @xmath565 , then using   we see that the left hand side expression in   is equal to @xmath566 finally , the bound obtained in the previous lemma provides the desired control of distortion for the compositions on a neighborhood which is expanded up to a macroscopic length .",
    "more precisely , the following holds .",
    "[ p : final ] there exists @xmath288 such that , for every point @xmath43 not belonging to the orbit of @xmath47 , there exists a sequence @xmath567 of neighbourhoods of @xmath43 converging to @xmath43 such that to each @xmath568 one can associate a sequence of elements @xmath569 in @xmath18 satisfying @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "we will check the conclusion of the lemma for @xmath572 . indeed ,",
    "fix @xmath549 and consider the sequence of compositions @xmath573 associated to @xmath43 and @xmath552 provided by the previous lemma . denoting @xmath574 and @xmath575 , for the neighborhood @xmath576 of @xmath43 we have @xmath577 by proposition  [ bound ] , the distortion coefficient of the composition @xmath578 is bounded from above by @xmath579 in a neighborhood of  @xmath305 of radius @xmath580 where @xmath581 now according to  , the conclusion   allows to estimate the sum  : @xmath582 therefore , the chosen @xmath583 is less than or equal to  @xmath584 , which implies the desired estimate for the distortion .",
    "finally , notice that @xmath585 and the last expression tends to zero as @xmath552 goes to infinity .",
    "thus , for the family of neighborhoods @xmath586 obtained by the procedure described above for @xmath587 going to infinity , we indeed see that @xmath567 indeed collapse to  @xmath43 , and this concludes the proof of the proposition .",
    "the latter proposition provides the desired bound for the distortion of the expansion on small neighborhoods of the density point  @xmath588 . by the arguments already mentioned in section  [ ss : minimality ] , this implies the ergodicity of the action , thus finishing the proof of theorem  [ description ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be a finitely generated group of @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms for which property  holds with respect to a prescribed riemannian metric .",
    "given a new riemannian metric on @xmath157 , let us denote by @xmath589 the function which corresponds to the quotient of both metrics . if we denote by @xmath590 ( resp .",
    "@xmath591 ) the derivative of @xmath141 with respect to the original ( resp .",
    "the new ) metric , then one has @xmath592 . by theorem  [ description ] , a point @xmath255 does not belong to the orbit of any non - expandable point with respect to the initial metric if and only if the set @xmath522 is unbounded .",
    "now since the value of @xmath262 is bounded from above and away from zero , this happens if and only if the set @xmath593 is also unbounded .",
    "therefore , every point @xmath43 which is non - expandable for the new metric is in the orbit of some point @xmath186 which is non - expandable for the original one . by property",
    ", there exists @xmath39 and @xmath38 in @xmath100 having @xmath186 as an isolated fixed point by the left and by the right , respectively .",

    "@xmath597 ) , and this shows that property  holds with respect to the new metric .",
    "we would like to close this section with a few comments on the idea of the proof of theorem  [ description ] above .",
    "for this , let us first introduce some terminology .",
    "for @xmath598 a point @xmath11 is said to be @xmath599-_distortion - expandable _ for the action of a finitely generated group  @xmath4 of @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms if for each @xmath600 one can find @xmath550 in @xmath18 such that @xmath601 and @xmath602    the arguments of the proof of proposition [ p : final ] prove more generally that if for some @xmath598 the set of @xmath599-distortion - expandable points has positive lebesgue measure and the action is minimal , then the lebesgue measure of this set equals @xmath82 , and the action is ergodic .",
    "therefore , a positive answer for the following question would also provide a positive answer for the ergodicity conjecture .    [ q : c - expansion ] is it true that , for every finitely generated non abelian group of @xmath45 circle diffeomorphisms whose action is minimal , there exists a constant @xmath309 such that lebesgue - a.e .",
    "point is @xmath599-distortion - expandable  ?      we will use the following fact from basic measure theory :    [ p : measure ] for any two non - atomic measures @xmath603 and @xmath604 on the circle , the limit ( in @xmath605 $ ] ) @xmath606 exists for @xmath607-almost every  @xmath43 .",
    "this limit is nonzero for @xmath603-almost every  @xmath43 and finite for @xmath604-almost every  @xmath43 .",
    "the set @xmath608 ( resp . , @xmath609 ) correspond to the singular part of @xmath604 with respect to @xmath603 ( resp . of @xmath603 with resp . to @xmath604 ) .",
    "the restrictions of the measures @xmath603 and @xmath604 to the set @xmath610 are equivalent , and the density of @xmath603 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath604 on @xmath66 equals  @xmath611 .",
    "let us first consider the case of a minimal case ( as we will see , the very same arguments can be used in the case of an exceptional minimal set ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a conformal measure with some exponent  @xmath65 for an action satisfying the property  , and assume that @xmath0 does not charge the orbit of @xmath47 .",
    "notice that an atom of  @xmath0 can be placed only at a point  @xmath43 with a bounded set of derivatives  @xmath48 .",
    "but we know from the second conclusion of theorem  [ description ] that such a point must belong to the orbit of a non - expandable one .",
    "so , as we assumed that the orbit of @xmath47 is not charged , the measure  @xmath0 is non - atomic .",
    "now , let us take any point @xmath612 and let us analyze the behaviour of the limit  ( [ eq : density ] ) with the help of proposition  [ p : final ] .",
    "this proposition provides us a sequence of neighborhood @xmath613 of the point @xmath43 , as well as expanding compositions @xmath614 , one has @xmath615 .",
    "hence , for every @xmath616 @xmath617 from the definition of @xmath65-conformality it follows that @xmath618 and hence , @xmath619 since the length of the image @xmath620 equals  @xmath583 for every  @xmath377 , the measures @xmath621 are bounded from below independently on  @xmath377 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath622 for some constants @xmath623 .",
    "now , let us consider the three possible cases for the conformal exponent : @xmath624 , @xmath625 , and @xmath86 .",
    "in the first case , we have @xmath626 so , for a subsequence of neighborhoods surrounding  @xmath43 ( recall that the neighborhoods  @xmath613 provided by proposition  [ p : final ] are not of arbitrary size , though they collapse to  @xmath43 ) , the `` density '' limit   is infinite .",
    "but due to proposition  [ p : measure ] , this limit should be finite for lebesgue - almost every point  @xmath43 .",
    "this contradiction shows that this case is impossible .    on the other hand , if @xmath86 , @xmath627 however , according to proposition  [ p : measure ] , the limit should be positive for @xmath0-almost every  @xmath43 .",
    "since by assumption the measure @xmath0 does not charge the set  @xmath81 , this gives a contradiction which makes this case impossible .",
    "the only case which is left is @xmath625 .",
    "but in this case the estimate   implies that the measure @xmath0 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue one , and its density ( due to the fact that @xmath0 is 1-conformal ) is an invariant function .",
    "since the lebesgue measure is ergodic , this density is constant , and hence the measure  @xmath0 is proportional to the lebesgue one , and actually equal to it due to the normalization .",
    "this concludes the proof in the minimal case .",
    "assume now that the group @xmath4 acts with an exceptional minimal set  @xmath59 and satisfies property  .",
    "once again , we see that if a conformal measure does not charge  @xmath81 , then it must be non - atomic .",
    "we still have the same estimates   and   on the derivative and on the quotient of measures , though the neighborhoods are now considered only for points in  @xmath59 . the argument excluding the exponent @xmath86 still works : the density limit @xmath628 of the measure @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "the lebesgue one can not be zero @xmath0-almost everywhere .",
    "similar arguments to the above ones exclude the case  @xmath625 : indeed , if @xmath65 was equal to  @xmath82 , this would imply that the measure  @xmath0 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue one , which is impossible , since the set  @xmath59 has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "finally , the case @xmath624 becomes possible : the density limit of  @xmath0 with respect to the lebesgue measure will be infinite only at the points of  @xmath59",
    ". however , there can be only one conformal exponent  @xmath65 and only one conformal measure  @xmath0 corresponding to this exponent .",
    "indeed , let @xmath629 be two conformal exponents corresponding to conformal measures  @xmath603 and @xmath604 , respectively .",
    "then , by re - applying the same arguments of control of distortion as above , and noticing that the measures @xmath630 of an interval @xmath620 of length  @xmath583 are bounded from below , we deduce from   that @xmath631 for some constants @xmath623 .    if @xmath632 , the inequalities   imply that the density limit   for the measures @xmath630 is zero on a subsequence for every point @xmath633 .",
    "however , this is impossible , since this density limit should be positive for @xmath603-almost every point of @xmath634 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath635 , these conformal measures are equivalent , and the density @xmath636 is an invariant function .",
    "so , once we prove that the measure @xmath603 is ergodic , this will imply that  @xmath637 .",
    "the ergodicity of the measure @xmath603 can be deduced in the same way as in theorem  [ description ] was deduced the ergodicity of the lebesgue measure for minimal case .",
    "namely , if  @xmath638 is a measurable invariant set , then @xmath603-almost every point in  @xmath56 is its @xmath603-density point . by expanding arbitrarily small neighborhoods of such a point , using the fact that ( due to the minimality of the action on  @xmath59 ) one has @xmath634 , and choosing a subsequence among the expanded intervals , at the limit we obtain an interval on which the points of  @xmath56 form a subset of full  @xmath603-measure . due to the minimality",
    ", this implies that  @xmath56 has full @xmath603-measure .",
    "this concludes the proof of the ergodicity , and thus that of theorem  [ conformalstar ] .",
    "let @xmath87 be a measure on  @xmath4 having finite first word - moment and such that there is no measure on the circle which is simultaneously invariant by all the maps in  @xmath98 . by p.  baxendale s theorem ( see section  [ ss : random ] ) , there exists an ergodic stationary measure  @xmath93 such that the corresponding random lyapunov exponent is strictly negative .",
    "we will prove that for @xmath93-almost every point  @xmath43 the lyapunov expansion exponent at  @xmath43 is positive .",
    "more precisely , we will prove that @xmath639 where @xmath640 stands for the lyapunov expansion exponent at @xmath93-almost every point ( due to the ergodicity of the measure  @xmath93 , this exponent is constant @xmath93-almost everywhere ) , and @xmath641 denotes the _ rate of escape _ for the convolutions of @xmath87 : @xmath642 notice that a direct consequence of   is that @xmath643    to prove the estimate  , fix @xmath299 , and consider the skew - product map @xmath644 since @xmath93 is an ergodic stationary measure , the random ergodic theorem ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) asserts that the @xmath118-invariant measure @xmath645 is ergodic .",
    "for each @xmath646 , consider the sets @xmath647 and @xmath648 notice that the measures of both sets @xmath218 and @xmath649 tend to  @xmath82 as @xmath105 tends to infinity ( this follows immediately from the definitions of the random lyapunov exponent and of the rate of escape ) .",
    "clearly , the same holds for the measures of the sets @xmath650 ( as @xmath118 preserves the measure  @xmath651 ) , as well as for the @xmath93-measures of the projections of these sets on the circle .",
    "but a point  @xmath305 belongs to the projection @xmath652 if and only if there exist  @xmath653 such that @xmath654 @xmath655 this implies that for the composition @xmath656 one has @xmath657 as @xmath658 , the set of points @xmath305 belonging to an infinite number of sets @xmath659 is of full @xmath93-measure . hence , @xmath660 and since @xmath299 was arbitrary , @xmath661 which concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "as we already noticed in remark  [ r : limit ] , assuming more restrictive assumptions on the moments , one can prove that the `` exponentially expanding '' compositions can be chosen of any length . to do this , due to borel - cantelli lemma",
    ", it suffices to check that the series @xmath662 converges . and indeed , by establishing some the control for the `` large deviations '' , one can show ( under certain additional assumptions ) that the measures of the sets @xmath218 and @xmath649 tend to  @xmath82 exponentially , which immediately implies this convergence .",
