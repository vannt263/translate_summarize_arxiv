    "of the various measures of entanglement in quantum many - body systems @xcite , geometric entanglement is a measure of the multipartite entanglement contained in a pure state .",
    "more precisely stated , the geometric entanglement ( ge ) quantifies the distance between a given quantum state wavefunction and the closest separable ( unentangled ) state  @xcite .",
    "ge has been shown to serve as an alternative marker to locate critical points for quantum many - body lattice systems undergoing quantum phase transitions .",
    "this was demonstrated explicitly for a number of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems @xcite for which the ge diverges near the critical point with an amplitude proportional to the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory at criticality @xcite .",
    "moreover , for 1d quantum systems at criticality , the leading finite - size correction to the ge per lattice site is universal @xcite , and related to the affleck - ludwig boundary entropy @xcite . for the lipkin - meshkov - glick model ,",
    "a system of mutually interacting spins embedded in a magnetic field for which analytic results can be derived , the global ge of the ground state and the single - copy entanglement behave as the entanglement entropy close to and at criticality  @xcite .",
    "ge thus serves as a useful tool to investigate quantum criticality in quantum many - body lattice systems .",
    "apart from some exceptions  @xcite , almost all work to date exploiting ge to study phase transitions has been restricted to quantum systems in 1d .",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulty to compute ge , because it involves a formidable optimization over all possible separable states .",
    "indeed , the calculation of various entanglement measures has been shown recently to be np - complete @xcite .",
    "this is further compounded by the inherent computational difficulties posed by two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum systems .",
    "nevertheless , significant progress has been made to develop efficient numerical algorithms to simulate 2d quantum many - body lattice systems in the context of tensor network representations  @xcite .",
    "the algorithms have been successfully exploited to compute , for example , the ground - state fidelity per lattice site  @xcite , which has been established as a universal marker to detect quantum phase transitions in many - body lattice systems .",
    "indeed , the ground state fidelity per lattice site is closely related to the ge .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that there should be an efficient way to compute the ge in the context of tensor network algorithms .",
    "this has been achieved for quantum many - body lattice systems with periodic boundary conditions in one spatial dimension in the context of the matrix product state representation  @xcite .",
    "quantum phase transitions in 2d quantum lattice models can be investigated using a number of different physical quantities , including local order parameters , fidelity per lattice site , single - copy entropy and multi - partite entropy measurement , and ge per lattice site .",
    "as is well known , local order parameters are defined relating to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of some symmetry group , which results in degeneracy of ground states .",
    "different degenerate ground states can be distinguished from different values of the local order parameters , and continuous and discontinuous phase transitions can be identified from the continuous and discontinuous behavior of the local order parameters .",
    "although demonstrated to be capable of detecting phase transitions , it is not entirely clear if ge can distinguish different degenerate ground states and identify both continuous and discontinuous quantum phase transitions .    to address this issue , we improve a systematic method @xcite to efficiently compute the ge per lattice site for 2d quantum many - body lattice systems in the context of tensor network algorithms based on an infinite projected entangled pair state ( ipeps ) representation .",
    "this method is used to evaluate the ge per lattice site for a number of distinct models defined on the infinite square lattice .",
    "these models are ( i ) the quantum ising model in a transverse field , ( ii ) the @xmath0-state quantum potts model with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , ( iii ) the spin-@xmath4 antiferromagnetic xxx model in an external magnetic field , ( iv ) the spin-@xmath4 antiferromagnetic xyx model in an external magnetic field , and ( v ) the spin-@xmath5 xxz model . by comparing the behavior of the local order parameters and the ge per site for the different models",
    ", it is seen that ge can detect both continuous and discontinuous quantum phase transitions . however , we observe that the continuity of the ge per site does not necessarily match with the continuity of local order parameters .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the definition of ge is given in section ii .",
    "results using the ge per lattice site as a marker of quantum phase transitions in the various 2d quantum models on the infinite square lattice are given in section iii using the procedure outlined in appendices a and b based on the ipeps representation .",
    "discussion of the results and concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "for a pure quantum state @xmath6 with @xmath7 parties , the ge , as a global measure of the multipartite entanglement , quantifies the deviation from the closest separable state @xmath8 . for a spin system",
    "each party could be a single spin but could also be a block of contiguous spins .",
    "the ge @xmath9 for an @xmath7-partite quantum state @xmath6 is expressed as  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the maximum fidelity between @xmath6 and all possible separable ( unentangled ) and normalized states @xmath8 , with @xmath12 the ge per party @xmath13 is then defined as @xmath14 it corresponds to the maximum fidelity per party @xmath15 , where @xmath16{{\\lambda_{{\\rm max}}}},\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath17 the relation ( [ def ] ) is analogous to the relation between the free energy and the partition function .",
    "note that for unentangled states the ge is zero .    for our purpose , we shall consider a quantum many - body system on an infinite - size square lattice , which undergoes a quantum phase transition at a critical point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in this situation , each lattice site constitutes a party , thus the ge per party is the ge per lattice site , which is well defined in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath18 ) , since the contribution to the fidelity from each party ( site ) is multiplicative . in the infinite size limit we thus denote @xmath19 as the ge per site .",
    "in this section we provide an analysis from the perspective of ge of different 2d quantum spin systems undergoing different types of quantum phase transitions .",
    "the ge per site has previously been applied to ground states of a number of 1d spin chains @xcite and some 2d models  @xcite across primarily continuous phase transitions .",
    "our analysis here extends these previous studies to a wider range of 2d quantum models and with more exotic situations .",
    "previously , the ge of ground states for the quantum ising model in a transverse field and the xyx model on the square lattice have been investigated with trg  @xcite and ipeps  @xcite approaches , both of which show a continuous behavior in the ge corresponding to a continuous phase transition .",
    "our results are based on the application and improvement of an ipeps algorithm for the calculation of the ge of 2d quantum systems @xcite , as detailed in appendices a and b. preliminary results along this direction were also reported in ref .",
    "the size of the truncation dimension @xmath20 controls the underlying accuracy of the ipeps algorithm . for the purposes of this study , which focusses on the general behavior of the ge in the vicinity of quantum critical points , we consider sufficiently large values of @xmath20 , compared to refs .",
    "@xcite , to be confident of the observed behavior .",
    "refinements in the implementation of the basic ipeps algorithm have been discussed recently @xcite .",

    "the parameter @xmath25 measures the strength of the transverse magnetic field , with a phase transition from a ferromagnetic phase with two degenerate ground states to a paramagnetic phase with a single ground state occurring at the critical value @xmath26 .",
    "this model has been widely studied via a number of different techniques .",

    "our results , in line with previous studies  @xcite , demonstrate that ge is able to detect continuous quantum phase transitions and factorized fields for different 2d quantum systems .",
    "continuous phase transitions are marked by a characteristic continuous cusp - like behavior of the ge per site at the critical point .",
    "this behavior is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for the 2d quantum ising model in a transverse field .",

    "it is thus clear that the measure of ge can distinguish between continuous and discontinuous phase transitions in the 2d quantum @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "this overall picture is not so simple , however .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently that quantum phase transitions should be treated with caution , at least with regard to the ground state entanglement spectrum @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we have seen an example where the ge is continuous with non - maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous .",

    "[ fig3](c ) ) .",
    "we have also seen examples where the ge per site shows continuous behavior at discontinuous phase transition points .",

    "[ figxyx](c ) and fig .",
    "[ figxxz_2](d ) ) but the corresponding local staggered magnetizations ( fig .  [ figxyx](b ) and fig .  [ figxxz_2](b ) ) are discontinuous .",
    "we have also considered the single - copy entanglement @xmath133 , in which the system under consideration is divided into two parts , one with @xmath134 lattice sites and the other with the other lattice sites .",
    "it is known that the single - copy entanglement @xmath133 sets a bound for the ge  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath135 , with @xmath136 the largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix @xmath137 for an @xmath134-site subsystem .",
    "it is found that the single - copy entanglements @xmath138 and @xmath139 show the same continuous behavior near the phase transition points for the models considered here , as shown , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ figxxz_1 ] for the spin-@xmath5 xxz model .",
    "it appears then for such systems , for which discontinuous phase transitions occur corresponding to different types of symmetry breaking and the total magnetization is continuous , both multi - partite and bi - partite entanglement measures are continuous .",
    "this situation can be further understood as follows .",
    "first , as already mentioned , due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking , including the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry , different degenerate ground states are detected in the broken symmetry phase by different values of the local order parameter .",
    "however , the ge takes the same value for all degenerate ground states . in terms of entanglement , this can be understood from the ge being a global measure of entanglement , which is the same for all degenerate ground states . from a different perspective",
    ", we can suppose the closest separable state to the ground state and the ground states share some property , i.e. , we suppose the closest separable state of different degenerate ground states breaks the same symmetry of the ground states . and @xmath140 satisfying @xmath141",
    ", the closest separable state of different degenerate groundstate @xmath142 and @xmath143 has the same relationship , i.e. , the two closest separable states to the two states would correspondingly satisfy @xmath144 .",
    "then the fidelity between the groundstate @xmath145 and its closest separable state @xmath142 can be written as @xmath146 , which thus gives the same value for the ge . ]    also from the perspective of symmetry , it could be argued for the spin-@xmath132 xyx model and the spin-@xmath5 xxz model that the discontinuity due to the isometry can not be detected with the ge measure because the hamiltonian / ground state obeys a dual symmetry either side of the phase transition point .",
    "for the spin-@xmath132 xyx model this symmetry is in @xmath86 , with @xmath111 the  self - dual \" point .",
    "is @xmath147 , with @xmath148 in the xyx model , the hamiltonian obeys a duality relation under the transformation @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "] given such a duality of the hamiltonian , both the ground state and its closest separable state are also each dual under this transformation , so the fidelity between the ground state and its closest separable state also obeys the same relation , leading to continuous behavior across the phase transition point .",
    "similarly for the spin-@xmath5 xxz model , the hamiltonian is symmetric at @xmath112 , with @xmath153 breaking the symmetry into easy - plane and easy - axis . in this case",
    "such a duality in the total staggered magnetization of the easy - plane and easy - axis would imply a duality of a local property of the ground state wavefunction , leading to continuity in the ge .",
    "we have seen then three different types of continuous ge across a phase transition point :    \\(i ) ge is continuous with maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous ,    \\(ii ) ge is continuous with maximum value at the transition point but the phase transition is discontinuous , and    \\(iii ) ge is continuous with non - maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous .    for the models under consideration",
    "the second and third types are related to a point of dual symmetry and a fully polarized phase , respectively .",
    "given this refinement in our understanding of ge as a marker of quantum phase transitions , and the development of powerful tensor network algorithms , we can be confident that ge can be used as an alternative route to explore quantum criticality in quantum lattice models .",

    "we then proceed to compute the ge per site , which involves the optimization over all the separable states . for our purpose ,",
    "we define @xmath198",
    ". the optimization amounts to computing the logarithmic derivative of @xmath199 with respect to @xmath200 , which is expressed as @xmath201    the problem therefore reduces to the computation of @xmath202 in the context of the tensor network representation .",
    "first , note that a pictorial representation of the derivative @xmath203 of the four - index tensor @xmath176 with respect to @xmath177 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](ii ) , which is nothing but the five - index tensor @xmath157 .",

    "[ fig2](iv ) . in our scheme ,",
    "we update the real and imaginary parts of @xmath178 separately : @xmath204 here @xmath205 is the step size in the parameter space , which is tuned to be decreasing during the optimization process . in addition , we have normalized the real and imaginary parts of the gradient @xmath202 so that their respective largest entries are unity .",
    "the procedure to update the tensor @xmath179 is the same .",
    "if the fidelity per unit cell converges , then the closest separable state @xmath8 is achieved , thus the geometric entanglement per lattice site for the ground state wavefunction @xmath6 follows .",
    "the above scheme has some basic limitations for the practical calculation of the ge per site .",
