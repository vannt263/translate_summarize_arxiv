    "a prototype problem in the field of nuclear condensed matter physics is to determine and understand the magnetic hyperfine field ( hff ) at any of the elements of the periodic table , incorporated as a substitutional impurity in a simple ferromagnetic host such as bcc fe .",
    "understanding hyperfine fields forms a critical test for our understanding of condensed matter .",
    "moreover , they provide a convenient tool for nuclear physicists to determine nuclear magnetic moments : two features that explain the decades of experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite efforts that have been devoted to this problem .",
    "today , the hyperfine fields of all elements as substitutional impurities in bcc fe are well - understood up to about z=55 @xcite .",
    "for the heavier 5d impurities , sizeable deviations between theory and experiment remain@xcite .",
    "the hyperfine fields of very light impurities at interstitial sites in fe have been calculated as well@xcite .",
    "lanthanide impurities in fe are much less understood , both experimentally and theoretically . as far as experiment",
    "is concerned , it is hard to obtain _ reliable _ values for the lanthanide hyperfine fields ( and also for their electric - field gradients , see below ) .",
    "this problem is illustrated by the rather desperate conclusion of l.  niesen in a still useful review@xcite back in 1976 :  _ ( ... ) if we can not perform experiments that yield unambiguous results , we should better do no experiments at all . _ \" on the theoretical side , no _ ab initio _ studies have been performed yet for lanthanide impurities in fe ( an approach using a model hamiltonian is developed in ref .  ) .",
    "the reason for this lies in a known failure of the widely used local density approximation ( lda ) within density functional theory ( dft ) : lda is not suitable to describe strong electron correlations@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the strongly correlated and mainly _ localized _",
    "4f states in lanthanides are rendered _ itinerant _ by lda .",
    "it can therefore be anticipated that for a lanthanide impurity in bcc fe , lda is incapable to describe correctly the interaction between these localized and strongly correlated 4f electrons and the itinerant 3d states of the host material .",
    "this could be overcome by treating the 4f states as core states , an approach that has been used in the past with some success for lanthanides@xcite . in this way",
    ", however , one forces the f - electrons to behave exactly as in free atoms , which is not entirely correct .",
    "an efficient and popular way to improve on the lda failure without resorting to fully atomic 4f behavior , is to use the lda+u method  @xcite . in lda+u ,",
    "the correlation absent in lda is reintroduced by an on - site coulomb repulsion parameter u , to which an _ a priori _ value has to be assigned .",
    "the lda+u method has been used in the recent past with considerable success ( recent examples are refs .",
    "and many others ) , but it is not yet clear where the boundaries of its range of applicability are . in this work , we will examine how well lda+u performs on a delicate quantity as the hff .",
    "an extra feature for lanthanide impurities in fe that is absent for lighter impurities , is the presence of a large electric - field gradient ( efg ) at the lanthanide nucleus . at a site with cubic point symmetry  such as a substitutional site in bcc fe  the efg tensor must be necessarily zero . due to the strong spin - orbit coupling for these heavy impurities , however ,",
    "the crystalline cubic point symmetry at the lanthanide site is lowered to a tetragonal one .",
    "this allows the existence of a large efg at the nucleus of the impurity .",
    "the same happens for 5d impurities in fe@xcite , but there the efg is 2 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "we have calculated and analyzed this efg for lanthanides , and compare it with the sparse experimental data .",
    "the goals of this work can be summarized as follows . on the physical side , we want to obtain better _ quantitative _ and _ qualitative _ insight in magnetic hyperfine fields and electric - field gradients of lanthanide impurities in fe .",
    "this should allow us to asses better the reliability of the existing experiments , and to derive the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "on the technical side , we want to examine whether the range of applicability of the lda+u method can be extended to problems as delicate and sensitive as magnetic and electric hyperfine interactions of heavy impurities in a transition metal host .",
    "it will be shown that in the course of this analysis unexpected new results and questions show up , such as the influence of the lanthanide 5p electrons ( sec .",
    "[ sec - ldau ] and [ sec - efgldau ] ) and the position of the delocalization - localization transition in this system ( sec .",
    "[ sec - ldau ] and [ sec - pressure ] ) .",

    "the wave functions are expanded in spherical harmonics inside nonoverlapping atomic spheres of radius @xmath1 , and in plane waves in the remaining space of the unit cell ( = the interstitial region ) .",
    "for the fe atoms a @xmath1 value of 2.20 a.u",
    ".  was chosen , while for the lanthanide impurity we used @xmath22.45 a.u .",
    "the maximum @xmath3 for the expansion of the wave function in spherical harmonics inside the spheres was taken to be @xmath4 .",
    "the plane wave expansion of the wave function in the interstitial region was made up to @xmath5  a.u.@xmath6 , and the charge density was fourier expanded up to @xmath7 .",
    "the lattice constant of fe was fixed at the experimental value of 2.87   . in order to reproduce the situation of an isolated impurity in bulk fe",
    ", we used the supercell approach with a @xmath8 supercell where one iron atom was replaced by a lanthanide atom .",
    "the neighboring fe atoms will be displaced by the presence of this impurity , as was documented before for lighter impurities in fe@xcite .",
    "we took this effect into account in an average way by relaxing the nearest neighbors for eu as an impurity ( which is in the middle of the lanthanide series ) , and kept the same relaxation fixed for all other lanthanides .",
    "the eu - fe distance was 2.60   which is an increase of 0.11   with respect to the fe - fe distance and which is almost identical to the distance between 5p impurities and their fe neighbors@xcite .",
    "it was tested for another lanthanide ( er ) that there was only a marginal difference of less than 1  t between the hff obtained with the eu - fe distance and the correct er - fe distance ( 2.58   ) .",
    "a test for an extended supercell of 32 atoms was also performed .",
    "we relaxed the first four nearest neighbors .",
    "the eu - fe distance hardly changed ( 2.63   ) and the fermi contribution to the hyperfine field changed with 5  t. for the sampling of the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the @xmath8 supercell we took 75 special k - points in the irreducible part of the bz , which corresponds to a @xmath9 mesh .",
    "as exchange - correlation functional , the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite was used .",
    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupling was taken into account in all the calculations by a second - variational step scheme@xcite , using a cut - off energy @xmath10  ry .",
    "relativistic local orbitals ( rlo ) for the lanthanide 5p states were added to the basis set , because it is known that for actinides this allows to reduce the basis set size needed for the second variational step@xcite ( = lower @xmath11 ) .",
    "limitations in the implementation prevent to obtain correct efg s and dipolar hff s when rlo s are used .",
    "therefore , whenever such information was needed , the calculations were repeated without rlo s .",
    "this never had a large influence on the obtained values , however .",
    "for the lda+u method , the ` around the mean field ' ( amf ) scheme of czyyk and sawatzky@xcite was used .",
    "the choice of the u and j parameters is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec - ldau ] .",
    "free atoms were simulated by a supercell containing only one lanthanide and vacuum otherwise , leading to a separation of 9.4    between two ` neighboring ' lanthanides . for free ion calculations , this cell was charged .",
    "all the other parameters were chosen exactly the same as in the calculations for lanthanides in fe .",
    "let us first have a look at the experimental data set for the hff ( fig  [ fig1]-a ) .",

    "[ fig1],width=302 ]    only in 4 cases the magnitude of the hff _ and _ its sign are known with high reliability ( the sign of the hff indicates whether the field is parallel ( + ) or antiparallel ( - ) with respect to the magnetization of the fe host lattice ) .",
    "these cases are la ( -47(1 )  t)@xcite , ce ( -41(2 )  t)@xcite and lu ( -73.12(36 )  t)@xcite for which nuclear magnetic resonance on oriented nuclei ( nmr / on ) has been performed , and yb ( -125(8 )  t)@xcite on which time - dependent perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy ( tdpac ) has been applied .",
    "the latter technique has also been used for gd@xcite , albeit on a recoil - implanted sample which is not necessarily clean .",
    "the value of -26(8 )  t obtained in this way agrees well with an in principle reliable mssbauer measurement of -37  t , which is unfortunately not very well documented@xcite .",

    "the line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]-a summarizes the most likely interpretation of this data set .",
    "fig.[fig1]-a can be understood in terms of hund s rules and the model of campbell and brooks .",
    "based on heuristic arguments ( ref .  ) and first principles calculations ( ref .  ) , campbell and brooks showed that the _ interatomic _ exchange interaction between a transition metal 3d spin moment and a lanthanide 5d spin moment is antiferromagnetic ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "-a ) . due to hund",
    "s third rule , the lanthanide 4f orbital moment is antiparallel ( parallel ) to the 4f spin moment in the first ( second ) half of the series . because the orbital contribution to the hff ( which is parallel to the orbital moment ) is dominant for lanthanides , the total hff is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the fe moment  and hence called positive ( negative )  in the first ( second ) half of the series . [ fig2],width=302 ]    the lanthanide 4f moment is localized at the lanthanide site and can not directly interact with its transition metal neighbors , but it has a ferromagnetic _ intra - atomic _ exchange interaction with the lanthanide 5d moment .",
    "the result is a net antiferromagnetic coupling between the lanthanide 4f moment and the transition metal 3d moment ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "according to hund s third rule , the lanthanide orbital moment is antiparallel to the lanthanide spin moment for the 7 lightest lanthanides , and parallel to it for the 7 heaviest lanthanides . the dominant contribution to",
    "the hff is the orbital hff ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - lda ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) ,    , width=302 ]    which is parallel to the orbital moment .",
    "therefore , one expects the total hff to be parallel to the fe magnetization ( and hence positive ) for the light lanthanides , and antiparallel ( negative ) for the heavy ones , as is seen indeed in fig .",
    "[ fig1]-a .      as a first step ,",
    "we calculate the magnetic hff with the common lda",
    ". this will provide us with a data set to which we can later compare the possible improvement by lda+u , and it allows to introduce some peculiarities that will play a role in all later calculations as well .",
    "as is usual with this type of methods , our calculations involve an iterative procedure ( ` self - consistent field ' procedure ) that yields in the end a possible state of the calculated system , which is not necessarily the desired ground state : in the space of possible solutions , this self - consistent field procedure finds a _ local _ minimum , but not necessarily the _ global _ minimum .",
    "the local minimum that is obtained , depends to some degree on the starting configuration that was initially chosen .",
    "this behavior is prominently present for lanthanides in fe .",
    "if the spin moment of the lanthanide initially is put parallel to the fe spin moment , then this parallelism is maintained throughout the iterative procedure ( except for la , ce and pr , where the moment always spontaneously turns to an antiparallel orientation ) .",
    "we call this from now on the ferromagnetic solution . with an initially antiparallel configuration , an antiparallel ( or antiferromagnetic ) solution is obtained . if the lanthanide was given initially no spin moment , then a solution with a spin moment that is much reduced compared to the two preceding solutions was found . in order to decide which of those is the ground state",
    ", one has to look at the total energy of each solution .",
    "the total energy of the case with reduced moment was much higher than the others , and we will not consider it further .",
    "the energy differences between the other two solutions are given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .     - e@xmath12 ) .",
    "if this energy difference is positive , the antiferromagnetic situation has the lowest energy . energy difference for lda are compared with energy differences for lda+u with progressively larger u. the lda result is equivalent to u=0.0 ry .",
    "there are some gaps in the picture , because not for every situation a converged solution could be found . for pm",
    "the calculated energy difference is much larger ( 0.42  ry for u=0.6  ry ) and is out of scale .",
    "[ fig3],width=302 ]    for all lanthanides up to tb , the antiferromagnetic solution has the lower energy . starting with dy ,",
    "the ferromagnetic solution becomes the ground state .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the different contributions to the magnetic hff are given for both types of solutions .",
    "a hff is a magnetic field at the position of the nucleus , and it is built mainly from 3 contributions : the spin dipolar field , the fermi contact field and the orbital field .",
    "the spin dipolar field is generated by the spin moments of the electrons surrounding the nucleus .",
    "for cubic point symmetry , this contribution vanishes .",
    "the fermi contact field@xcite is of dipolar nature as well , but is due to the penetration of s - electrons into the nucleus .",
    "it does not vanish for cubic symmetry , and it is the dominant ( and almost only ) contribution for impurities up to z=55 in fe .",
    "the orbital field stems from the electric charge of the electron that orbits the nucleus , and it vanishes for cubic symmetry . as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows , the dipolar field does not exceed a few tesla , while the fermi contact field lies between -20  t and -40  t. the orbital field is the dominant contribution , and can reach almost @xmath13  t. at first sight , one would expect a zero orbital and dipolar field for a substitutional impurity in fe , as the point symmetry is cubic .",
    "the reason why this is not the case for lanthanides , is purely due to the presence of spin - orbit coupling , which breaks the crystalline cubic point group symmetry .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the orbital moment reflects hund s third rule : the orbital moment is antiparallel ( parallel ) to the spin moment in the first ( second ) half of the lanthanide series . because the orbital field is parallel to the orbital moment , it will for the antiferromagnetic solution be positive in the first half of the series and negative in the second half ( and vice versa for the ferromagnetic solution ) .    according to the lda total energies",
    ", we have to accept the antiferromagnetic solution as the ground state up to tb , and the ferromagnetic solution starting from dy .",
    "this leads to positive hff s for almost all lanthanides ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]-b ) , which is contradiction with the current interpretation of the experimental data set and with the model of campbell and brooks .",
    "we will demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec - ldau ] that this is a new , clear example of a failure of lda , to be added to the list of notorious shortcomings as the general overbinding behavior , the prediction of the wrong crystal structure for fe , and the prediction of metallicity for some strongly correlated insulators as nio and la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 . even if we would select the antiferromagnetic solution throughout ( as the campbell - brooks model suggests ) , then still the quantitative agreement with the experimental hff s is rather poor ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]-b ) .",
    "using and interpreting lda+u calculations brings some complications that are absent for lda .",
    "first , lda+u schemes are not fully _ ab initio _ : they involve an on - site coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath16 and an on - site exchange interaction constant @xmath17 that have to be chosen _ a priori _ for every atom with strong correlations . in our case",
    "we have to choose one @xmath16 and one @xmath17 for the f - states of the lanthanide impurity . in line with the strategy adopted for the relaxation ( sec .",
    "[ sec - compdetails ] ) , we strive for reasonable overall agreement and do not focus on agreement for individual cases too much",
    ". therefore we take the same @xmath16 and @xmath17 for all lanthanides .",
    "looking at other calculations@xcite and experiments@xcite , @xmath18ry is a reasonable choice .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is usually an order of magnitude smaller , and it does not affect the results as much as @xmath16 does . therefore we take @xmath17 as 10% of @xmath16 .",
    "second  complication with lda+u is that due to the introduction of tuneable variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the total energy looses its exact mathematical meaning as a variational quantity .",
    "if lda+u is used , a lower energy for one solution does therefor not necessarily mean that this solution is to be preferred over another one with a higher energy .",
    "this does not mean that these total energies are meaningless : for instance , lda+u has been used successfully to determine the equilibrium volume of materials by energy minimization@xcite .",
    "the current general opinion is that if the electronic structure does not _",
    "qualitatively _ change between two slightly different situations , then the total energies obtained by lda+u for these situations can probably be compared . the criterion to decide whether there is a qualitative difference between two electronic structures or not ,",
    "is provided by the 4f density matrix : in qualitatively similar cases , the occupation of the 14 m - orbitals (= the diagonal elements of the two spin - polarized @xmath19 density matrices ) should be more or less identical . finally  and third ",
    "there are much more local minima in the space of solutions when lda+u is used , and a calculation gets easily trapped in one of them . because the density matrices for two different solutions are necessarily different from each other , the total energy can not be used to determine which solution is the ground state .",
    "this problem is illustrated in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ,    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] shows that the main contribution to the total @xmath20 is due to the single 4f - up electron : @xmath21 .",
    "there is a large contribution of 5.6 + 9.6=15.2 with the opposite sign due to p - electrons .",
    "what is surprising is that this p - contribution does not stem from the valence 6p electrons , but from the entirely filled and strongly bound 5p shell , which lies more than 20  ev below the fermi energy .",
    "intuitively , one would have assumed such a filled and well - bound shell to be entirely spherically symmetric , which would mean @xmath22 . and indeed",

    "a negative @xmath32 corresponds to charge accumulation along the z - axis , a positive @xmath32 to charge accumulation in the xy - plane .",
    "the shape of the 4f orbitals is such that m=0 has its charge mainly along the z - axis ( reflected in a negative @xmath33 ) , while the xy - plane is more and more occupied for larger @xmath34 . apparently the 4f electrons dispel the 5p electrons : if m=0 is occupied , then the 5p electrons are forced away from the z - axis into the xy - plane , resulting in a positive @xmath25 and @xmath24 . as tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] shows , a 4f - up electron distorts the 5p orbitals with either spin : this is an interaction between the electron charges , not between the spins .",

    "the crystallographic surrounding is cubic and the slightly non - zero @xmath37 is due to spin - orbit coupling only , as is the case for lanthanides in fe ( compare with nd in fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this small @xmath32 is a sum of a f - f contribution of + 20 and a p - p contribution of -21 ( the d - d contribution is small : -1 ) .",
    "this can be compared to fig .",
    "[ figd ] for nd with the m=(-3 ,  -2 ,  -1 ) orbitals filled , which leads to a 4f - contribution + 14 and a 5p - contribution of -12 , quite similar values . because of this analogy , we suggest that also for u in uo@xmath14 th p - p contribution for an undistorted oxygen cage is due to the completely filled 6p shell . this interpretation would furthermore imply that as a function of oxygen cage deformation , the 6p - contribution in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "would remain almost constant ( just as the 5f - contribution does ) , and that the strong decrease of the total p - p contribution is due to 7p only .",
    "this makes sense , as this decrease is attributed  @xcite to the tails of the o-2p wave functions , and hence should appear near the fermi energy (= the region of the 7p ) .",
    "it is well known experimentally@xcite that the pure lanthanides exhibit a large variety of structural phase transitions as a function of external pressure . at certain pressures , volume collapses",

    "4f delocalization occurs at 59  gpa when the structure changes to body - centered monoclinic ( bcm ) with a volume collapse of 10.6% and in dy this happens at 73  gpa with a volume collapse of 6% . for nd and sm",
    "no volume collapse has been observed . in these two cases the delocalization of the 4f electrons",
    "was associated with the appearance of low - symmetry structures ( similar with those that appear in pr , gd and dy cases with volume collapse ) .",
    "this is a somewhat ambiguous procedure . for nd two transition pressures",
    "have been proposed : 40  gpa ( corresponding to the transition to an hp3 structure  @xcite ) and 113  gpa ( corresponding to the transition to the @xmath38-u phase  @xcite ) . for sm the delocalization pressure",
    "is proposed to be 37  gpa , when the sm structure changes to hp3 .",
    "for pm we have only a lower limit for the transition pressure , 60  gpa ( until this pressure no low - symmetry structure has been observed@xcite ) .",
    ", width=264 ]    in our calculations for lanthanide impurities we replace an fe atom from an iron lattice by a lanthanide atom .",
    "obviously the lanthanide atom ( which has a much larger volume ) will feel a chemical pressure or effective pressure .",
    "how large will this effective pressure be ?",
    "we concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec - ldau ] that at least ce and pr are delocalized .",
    "hence , the effective pressure  which we assume to be independent on the lanthanide in a first approximation  should be at least 20  gpa ( fig .",
    "[ pressure ] ) .",
    "the hyperfine fields for nd and sm are only very approximately measured ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]-a ) , such that one can not conclude whether they are localized or not . based on isomer shift and efg ( fig .  [ fig8 ] ) , eu is definitely localized , as are all heavier lanthanides .",
    "therefore , two qualitatively different proposals for the effective pressure are possible : about 25  gpa ( everything starting with nd is localized ) or about 40  gpa ( everything below eu is delocalized , except for pm and maybe nd ) . assuming an effective pressure that is not constant ( motivated by the decreasing volume of heavier lanthanides ) does not change this picture ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ pressure ]  these lines qualitatively take the lanthanide contraction into account ) . a more accurate experimental determination of hff and efg for nd , pm and sm in fe would allow to distinguish between both scenarios and would allow to determine the real position of the delocalization - localization transition in this system .",
    "experimental data for nd in fe are also for another reason interesting : if nd in fe would be found to be localized ( itinerant ) and the effective pressure of 40  gpa would known to be correct ( from a sm - measurement for instance ) than the delocalization pressure of 113  gpa ( 35  gpa ) for bulk nd is probably correct . if the effective pressure of 25  gpa would be correct , no such conclusion can be made .    in conclusion for this section , accurate measurement of hff and efg for nd , pm or sm in fe would offer a lot of information .",
    "lda+u calculations for free lanthanide 3@xmath39 ions were already mentioned in figs .",
    "[ figa]-  [ figd ] . a quite complete experimental data set exists for this situation as well , both for the hff ( fig .",

    "[ figd ] , both for divalent and trivalent lanthanides .",
    "[ fig10],width=302 ]    in the experiments , the ions were not really free but were incorporated in a paramagnetic salt , and the effect of crystal fields was removed later in order to find the free ion values . by the same procedure as explained for lanthanides in fe , we extracted lda+u predictions for the hff and @xmath32 for divalent and trivalent lanthanide ions , which are given by dashed and full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , respectively . for lanthanides in fe ,",
    "the positive z - direction was naturally defined by the moments of the ferromagnetic fe host atoms . for free lanthanides ,",
    "the total ( = spin+orbital ) angular momentum @xmath17 determines the positive z - direction .",
    "due to this different choice of axes , there is an _",
    "apparent _ sign change for the heavy lanthanides between fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( in fe ) and fig .",
    "[ fig10]-a ( free ) .",
    "the agreement with experiment is again quite nice .",
    "eu is divalent ( it was trivalent in fe ) , while yb is trivalent ( it was divalent in fe ) .",
    "for sm there is a large deviation , both for the hff and @xmath32 .",
    "but this is no surprise : it is well - known there are low - lying excited states in sm which will mix with the ground state , such that our procedure which is based on hund s rules ground states is expected to fail .",
    "the possibility to consider non - collinear magnetism at every infinitesimal region of space has recently been implemented@xcite in the wien2k code . in principal this can be an important feature even for collinear antiferromagnets as we are dealing with here : it allows the spin moment to turn _ gradually _ from the fe - orientation to the opposite lanthanide - orientation , and this is a better replication of what happens also in nature .",
    "we did not attempt a full study , but calculated hff and efg for tm in fe only .",
    "all technical parameters were chosen exactly the same as in the collinear calculations .",
    "for tm in fe as test example , the total hff changes from -822 t in the collinear lda+u calculation to -838 t in a non - collinear one , while the efg remains exactly the same : -38.1 @xmath40 v / m@xmath41",
    ". such a change of 16  t is not small in absolute value , but is negligible compared to the large values of the hff s in this problem .",
    "therefore we conclude that non - collinear magnetism does nt play an important role for lanthanides in fe .",
    "we have demonstrated that lda leads to a qualitatively wrong behavior for the magnetism of lanthanides in fe . using lda+u , qualitative and quite reasonable quantitative agreement with experiment",
    "is obtained , both for hff and efg .",
    "this shows that the semi _ ab initio _ lda+u method is a useful tool even for such sensitive quantities as hyperfine parameters of strongly correlated impurities in an itinerant magnetic host .",
    "we could come to these conclusions only after applying a careful strategy in order to cope with the lack of a good criterion to determine the true ground state if lda+u is used .",
    "for all lanthanides the 4f spin moment couples antiferromagnetically to the fe 3d moment , in agreement with the model of campbell and brooks .",
    "the orbital hff is by far the dominant contribution to the total hff ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the calculated value of the efg for lanthanides in fe agrees well with the few experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we discovered an unexpectedly strong contribution of the completely filled 5p shell to the dipolar hff and the efg , which can be explained by their common @xmath0 dependence : small deformations of the 5p shell in a region close to the nucleus are strongly emphasized .",
    "a reinterpretation of recent efg calculations@xcite for uranium in uo@xmath14 suggests that the same is true for the 6p shell in actinides .",
    "furthermore , we conclude that yb is divalent in an fe host , while all other lanthanides are trivalent ( including eu , with perhaps an exception for tm ) .",
    "the lightest lanthanides ( at least up to pr ) show delocalized 4f behavior , and we conclude that the delocalization - localization transition that typically happens already at ce is postponed for lanthanides in fe : it falls at least after pr and current experiments do not exclude that it could go up to sm ( although pm is certainly localized ) .",
    "this can be explained by the large effective pressure that is felt by these lanthanide impurities ( either 25 or 40  gpa - fig .",
    "[ pressure ] ) , leading to a larger overlap between the 4f wave functions and the neighboring fe-3d .",
    "the question of a postponed localization transition has never been touched before in the 40 years of experiments on this system .",
    "this illustrates what can be the added value of ab - initio calculations for hyperfine interactions studies .",
    "also in the case of free lanthanide ions , hff and efg can be quantitatively reproduced .",
    "remarkably , eu is divalent in this case and yb is trivalent  just the opposite as for lanthanides in fe .",
    "the effect of fully non - collinear magnetism on this problem was tested to be negligible .",
    "obviously , the numerical agreement of the calculated hyperfine fields with experiment is for these lanthanides still much less satisfactorily then it is for lighter impurities . with the current methods ,",
    "there are only limited possibilities to improve the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the supercell can be extended to e.g.  32 atoms and relaxation of the fe - neighbours can be calculated for every individual element ( this requires the calculation of forces including spin - orbit coupling and lda+u , which is time - consuming and not yet fully implemented in wien2k ) .",
    "but as inevitably a rather arbitrary choice remains to be made for the value of @xmath16 , it is not clear whether these sophistications will really improve the agreement with experiment . and",
    "most likely they will not add anything new to the physical insight . in our opinion , new progress in this topic will have to come from experiment .",
    "many of the experimentally determined hff s and efg s carry still large error bars .",
    "accurate measurements  for instance with the nmr / on method  are desirable ( note that nmr / on has not yet been applied for any of the lanthanides with a large efg and/or hff : such large hyperfine interactions put severe requirements on the equipment ) .",
    "the predicted hff s and efg s from this work should allow to reduce considerably the frequency domain that has to be scanned in an nmr / on experiment , and warrants a more physical and reliable interpretation of the observed resonances .",
    "as most worthwhile experiments , we suggest a more accurate determination of hff and efg for pr to sm : this would allow to examine experimentally the position of the delocalization - localization transition .",
    "once a data set with improved accuracy will be available , it can serve in its turn as a testing ground for future generations of _ ab initio _ many body methods .",
