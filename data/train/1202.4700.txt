    "thin si wafers are attractive for solar cell applications , because they can reduce the material consumption and thereby decrease the cost of solar electricity . however",

    "light is to deposit metallic nanoparticles on the solar cell .",
    "metallic nanoparticles can scatter light into the solar cell by the localized surface plasmon resonance , which is a collective oscillation of the conduction electrons @xcite .",

    ", the localized surface plasmon resonance will scatter the light further into the solar cell , thereby increasing the absorption and efficiency .",

    "the nanocrystals in this work have been made by a chemical synthesis of metallic nanoparticles , using chemical reduction of silver salts by sodium borohydride .",
    "this method has shown to be a simple , economical , and popular method that can be applied in large scales as required for industrial applications@xcite .",
    "the surface plasmon resonance depends on the shape of the nanocrystal surface , size , spatial arrangement , and configuration of the nanocrystals @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to investigate these features in detail . in our previous work we studied the nanocrystals shape depending on defects in the nanocrystals @xcite . in this article , the size distribution of nanocrystals made with different molar ratios of agno@xmath0 to nabh@xmath1 were examined in detail and related to the scattering of light when incorporated into the solar cell device .",
    "the ag nanocrystals were made by a wet chemical reduction synthesis mixing a silver nitrate solution ( agno@xmath0 , 99.9% purity , qualigens fine chemicals ) with a highly reducing solution sodium borohydride ( nabh@xmath1 , 95% purity , merck ) without further purification .",
    "all equipment was thoroughly cleaned by soaking in ethanol and washed with distilled water .",
    "a 0.6 mm agno@xmath0 precursor solution was prepared using deionized h@xmath2o , together with a 1.2 mm aqueous nabh@xmath1 solution . in order to prevent agglomeration ,",

    "the simulation shows that the location of the peak moves to a larger wavelength as the nanocrystal diameter increases .",
    "in addition , the standard deviation increases and a second scattering peak emerges at a smaller wavelength .    these simulations were performed with the assumption of mono - disperse spherical nanocrystals . as shown in the previous section ,",
    "the sizes of the nanocrystals in each sample are log - normally distributed . for every fitted size distribution ,",
    "a corresponding light scattering spectrum was obtained by taking a weighted linear combination of the simulated spectra at various nanocrystal sizes , the weights being the densities of the nanocrystal sizes in the fitted distribution .",

    "the main peak of every such spectrum is less symmetric and has a larger standard deviation than corresponding samples with only mono dispersive nanocrystals .",

    "a mono - disperse spherical nanocrystal with a diameter of 20 nm to the weighted spectrum of sample 45 , one finds that the peaks are located at roughly the same wavelength .",
    "however , the width and shape of the peaks are different , and one can distinguish three additional peaks around the main peak of the weighted spectrum .",
    "this shows that the size distribution of the ag nanocrystals when embedded in a solar cell has a large effect upon the scattering properties of the device .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a similar analysis was carried out for ag nanocrystals in sio@xmath2 , sin , and al@xmath2o@xmath0 matrices ( see figure [ scattering : scatteringlog ] ) .",
    "the same effects as described for ag nanocrystals in an si matrix are shown for the ag nanocrystals embedded in these matrices . however , for these matrices the maximum scattering peaks lie in the range of 400 - 500 nm .",
    "the solar spectrum convertible by crystalline silicon cells lies between 370 and 1100 nm ( 100 nm corresponds to @xmath51.1 ev , which is the band gap of si ) @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to have a broad scattering peak at a wavelength where the si absorbs most of the light .",
    "when the thickness of the si wafer decreases , more of the large wavelength light ( 600 - 1100 nm ) will pass through the solar cell and will not be absorbed .",

    "the figure shows the wavelength with maximum scattering versus the molar ratio for ag nanocrystals embedded in si , sio@xmath2 , sin , and al@xmath2o@xmath0 matrices .",
    "these plots can be used to find the molar ratio needed to make nanocrystals that scatter a particular wavelength maximally .    ,",
    "sin , and al@xmath2o@xmath0 matrix.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    from the solar energy spectrum presented by atwater and polman @xcite it seems useful to have a scattering maximum located at a wavelength of at least 600 nm , for example at 700 nm .",
    "a maximum scattering peak at 700 nm seems possible only if the ag nanocrystal size is 1060 nm , 608 nm , and 352 nm when embedded in a sio@xmath2 , al@xmath2o@xmath0 , and sin matrix , respectively .",
    "these sizes were found by extrapolating the wavelength of maximum scattering versus the molar ratio for ag nanocrystals in figure [ scattering : rvms ] for the three materials .",
    "the surface plasmon resonance depends on the nanocrystal size being smaller than the wavelength of incoming light .",
    "since most of the absorbed light has a wavelength of 400 nm or larger , only nanocrystals with diameter at most 400 nm will yield a surface plasmon resonance effect .",
    "this makes sin the best material for embedding the ag nanocrystals .",
    "it follows that the ag nanocrystals studied in this article are much smaller than what is most suitable for maximum scattering of light with a wavelength of 700 nm .",
    "nevertheless , some additional absorption of low wavelength light is possible to obtain when depositing these ag nanocrystals on a solar cell device .",
    "silver nanocrystals were made by chemical reduction synthesis of silver salts by sodium borohydride .",
    "the nanocrystal size distributions were fitted with log - normal distributions .",
    "the plotted distributions showed that increasing the agno@xmath0/nabh@xmath1 molar ratio resulted in an increased mean nanocrystal size , and a linear relation between the mean nanocrystal size and the agno@xmath0/nabh@xmath1 molar ratio was found . by simulating scattering spectra using mie plot and weighing these by the log - normal size distribution densities ,",
    "scattering spectra were found for each sample . for a sample of ag nanocrystals",
    "whose sizes are log - normally distributed , the scattering peak is less symmetric and broader than for nanocrystals of a fixed size . in order to increase the efficiency of a solar cell device using a thin si wafer , ag nanocrystals embedded in a sin layer with a diameter of 352 nm",
