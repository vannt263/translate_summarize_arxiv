    "the concept of preformed fermion pairs or bosonic degrees of freedom which condense to form a superfluid can be found in many domains of correlated quantum many - body systems .",

    "quantum lattice fluctuations play a crucial role in one dimension . for classical phonons ( i.e. , in the adiabatic limit )",
    ", the peierls instability leads to a @xmath0 periodic lattice deformation , resulting in corresponding charge ordering of electron pairs ( bipolarons ) and the opening of a gap at the fermi level .",
    "in contrast , for the holstein model , one can argue and give numerical evidence @xcite that quantum phonons will close the charge gap but preserve the spin gap , thereby giving rise to a `` bad metal '' state . in the latter ,",
    "electrons bind into pairs and are mostly localised in the @xmath0 charge order pattern .",
    "this results in a very high effective charge - carrier mass or , equivalently , in a very small drude weight .",
    "we refer to this state as `` the peierls state '' , which is to be distinguished from an insulating peierls state with long - range charge order @xcite .",
    "the latter has been studied intensely in holstein - type models with and without spin , see discussion in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the metallic peierls state may be regarded as a more general concept for quasi - one - dimensional systems , applicable to noncommensurate fillings or the normal state ( @xmath1 ) of a peierls insulator @xcite . on the level of bosonization , a metallic state with dominant @xmath0 charge correlations",
    "requires a finite spin gap @xcite . in the anti - adiabatic limit",
    ", the lattice adjusts instantaneously to the electronic motion , and the holstein model maps onto the attractive hubbard model with dominant pairing correlations .",
    "the question addressed in this article is the nature of the crossover from the adiabatic to the anti - adiabatic regime .",
    "the limiting cases of low ( but finite ) and high ( or infinite ) phonon frequency can be described as a luther - emery liquid @xcite , corresponding to a luttinger liquid with a gapless charge mode and a gapped spin mode .",
    "a key result of the present work is that the crossover occurs without a closing of the spin gap , which suggests that the bipolarons existing in the peierls state do not dissociate as a function of phonon frequency but instead constitute the preformed pairs of the superfluid phase .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we introduce the model and explain the key ideas of the continuous - time quantum monte carlo method .",

    ", the problem can be solved very efficiently by means of interaction - expansion continuous - time quantum monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such a formulation is that we do not have to sample the lattice degrees of freedom directly , thereby eliminating the need for a hilbert space cutoff .",
    "the details of the implementation of this algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the ctqmc method has previously been applied to the spinless @xcite and the spinful holstein model @xcite , as well as to a model with nonlocal electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",

    "the one - dimensional , half - filled holstein model  with or without an additional hubbard term to describe electron - electron repulsion  has been studied for many years .",

    "many aspects of the relevant physics can also be captured by a spinless model with filling @xmath26 , including an extended metallic region in the phase diagram @xcite , the renormalization of the phonon mode @xcite , and soliton excitations @xcite .",
    "retardation effects in the half - filled holstein model were discussed , for example , in @xcite , and for the spin - peierls transition in @xcite .    here",
    "we study the effect of phonon frequency in the _ quarter - filled _ holstein model at a fixed electron - phonon coupling strength . for quarter filling and low phonon frequencies , the absence of first - order umklapp scattering ",
    "dominant at half filling  suppresses the peierls instability , and stabilises a state with gapless charge but gapped spin degrees of freedom , as well as a nonzero single - particle excitation gap , and dominant but critical @xmath0 charge correlations ( a luther - emery liquid with interaction parameter @xmath27 ) .",

    "recently , the existence of a correlated singlet state in the holstein - hubbard model away from half filling has been suggested @xcite .",
    "compared to half filling , the critical value for the transition to a peierls insulator is significantly larger at quarter filling @xcite .",
    "this increase may be understood in terms of a devil s staircase , similar to charge - density - wave transitions in extended hubbard models away from half filling @xcite .",

    "the fluctuations resulting from a finite phonon frequency close the charge gap , and render the pairing correlations critical . comparing figures  [ static.fig](a ) and  [ static.fig](b )",
    ", we see that the suppression of the @xmath0 charge correlations is accompanied by an increase of the pairing correlations , especially at large distances .",
    "a possible interpretation is that with increasing phonon frequency , the trapping of bipolarons in the @xmath0 lattice modulation gives way to a `` _ condensation _ '' ( in the usual sense of superfluidity in one dimension ) of those preformed pairs .    ) and",

    "evidence for the existence of bound pairs is provided by the equal - time spin - spin correlation function @xmath56 which we show in figure  [ static.fig](c ) .",
    "for all values of the phonon frequency , the cusps at @xmath57 and @xmath47 are smeared out , thus lending support to an exponential decay of the spin correlations .",
    "the presence of a spin gap will be explicitly confirmed by results for the dynamical spin structure factor below .",
    "finally , we plot in figure  [ static.fig](d ) the momentum distribution function @xmath58 following the above interpretation , we expect a smooth variation of this quantity as a function of wavevector @xmath9 .",
    "in particular we do not expect any nonanalytical behaviour at @xmath59 or @xmath60 . for classical phonons ,",
    "the smooth variation of @xmath61 stems from the nonzero single - particle gap of the peierls state . in the anti - adiabatic limit , where the model maps onto the attractive hubbard model , this behaviour is equally expected since it is known that the ground state is a luther - emery liquid with gapped single - particle excitations @xcite .",
    "since we observe a continuous crossover from low to high frequencies in figure  [ static.fig](d ) , we argue that our data supports the existence of a single - particle gap for all considered values of @xmath62 ; this is confirmed in figure  [ akw.fig ] and discussed in the following subsection .",
    "our analysis of the equal - time correlation functions in this section suggests the existence of a crossover from dominant diagonal ( charge - density - wave ) to dominant off - diagonal ( pairing ) fluctuations as a function of the phonon frequency .",
    "this evolution is confirmed by the results for @xmath50 and @xmath63 shown in figure  [ fig : cdw - pairing ] , where we plot these two correlators at the largest distance @xmath52 for different @xmath25 .",
    "whereas for @xmath40 the charge correlations decay significantly slower than the pairing correlations , see figure  [ fig : cdw - pairing](a ) , dominant pairing correlations can be seen for @xmath54 in figure  [ fig : cdw - pairing](b ) .",
    "the ratio of the exponents obtained from least - square fits is @xmath64 for @xmath40 , and @xmath65 for @xmath54 .      with the help of a stochastic analytical continuation scheme @xcite",

    "for the two values of the phonon frequency considered here ( @xmath83 ) , the dynamical charge structure factor in figures  [ dynamic.fig](c ) and ( d ) shows two features : a high - energy particle - hole continuum reminiscent of the noninteracting problem , and a low - lying excitation band . at @xmath84 , figure  [ dynamic.fig](c ) ,",
    "the dispersion of the latter is extremely flat and within our resolution we can not distinguish the associated charge velocity from zero .",

    "the density and pairing correlators have the form @xcite @xmath98 in addition to an exponential decay of the spin - spin correlations .",
    "the dominant correlations are @xmath0 density correlations for @xmath99 , and pairing correlations for @xmath100 . our numerical results , in particular those shown in figure  [ fig : cdw - pairing ] , are hence best understood in terms of an enhancement of @xmath101 from values smaller than one at small @xmath39 ( leading to dominant charge - density - wave correlations ) to values larger than @xmath102 in the nonadiabatic regime where we observe significantly larger pairing correlations .",
    "a quantitative finite - size scaling of @xmath101 is difficult for several reasons , including the necessity to increase @xmath25 in steps of eight , and the possible importance of logarithmic corrections as a result of retardation effects @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a cubic extrapolation based on @xmath103 gives @xmath104 for @xmath40 and @xmath105 for @xmath54 .",
    "since the spin degrees of freedom always remain gapped , we have interpreted our results in terms of preformed pairs which are essentially localised in the @xmath0 charge - density - wave state realised in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this localisation leads to a metallic state with a small drude weight . upon increasing the phonon frequency , enhanced lattice fluctuations",
    "permit bipolaron motion , thereby providing a kinetic energy gain .",
    "the resulting state is characterised by a significantly larger drude response or , equivalently , an enhanced bipolaron velocity .",
