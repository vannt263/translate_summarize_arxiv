    "a33 is a medium - distant abell cluster of galaxies with very few and sparse information in both the x - ray and the optical bands .",
    "this cluster was claimed to have been detected by the heao1-a1 all sky survey ( johnson et al .",
    "1983 , kowalski et al . 1984 ) with a count rate of @xmath9 counts @xmath10 s@xmath11 in the @xmath12 kev energy band .",
    "its luminosity was estimated , with large uncertainties , to be @xmath13 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "a33 was also observed with the ginga lac detector from december 9 to december 10 , 1988 ( arnaud 1991 ) , but no x - ray emission was found at the optical position of the cluster . from such a non - imaging observation ,",
    "arnaud ( 1991 ) were able to put an upper limit on the luminosity of a33 , @xmath14 erg s@xmath11 , assuming a temperature @xmath15 kev .",
    "the value of the x - ray luminosity derived from ginga data is inconsistent with the one derived from the heao1-a1 observation ( note , however , that a33 lies at the edge of the error box for the position of the heao1 source ) .",
    "the source 1rxsj002709.5 - 192616 in the rosat bright source catalog ( bsc : voges et al . , 1996 ) , at coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 , has been observed for @xmath18 sec with a count rate of @xmath19 cts / s .",
    "this source has @xmath20 net counts in the @xmath21 kev energy band corresponding to a flux @xmath22 erg s@xmath11 @xmath10 ( assuming a nominal conversion factor of @xmath23 erg @xmath10 s@xmath11 cts@xmath11 ) and does not appear to be extended .",
    "this source is unrelated to the cluster and most probably associated with an agn which is only @xmath24 away ( see table 1 , source 1saxj0027.1 - 1926 , and table 2 , source a ) .    in the optical band",
    "there is no detailed information except from that derived from the extensive study of leir & van den bergh ( 1977 ) , who classified a33 as a distance class @xmath25 , richness @xmath26 , bautz - morgan - class - iii cluster . in the abell ( 1958 )",
    "catalog , a33 has @xmath27 galaxies which lie within one abell radius ( @xmath28 arcmin ) and which are not more than 2 mag fainter than the third brightest galaxy .",
    "its photometrically estimated redshift , @xmath29 , was derived by leir & van den bergh ( 1977 ) from the cluster optical diameter and the magnitude of the brightest and tenth - brightest cluster galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we present a new x - ray observation of a33 obtained with beppo - sax .",
    "this observation enables us to derive detailed information on the x - ray source , on its morphology and thermal properties .",
    "the complex appearance of the x - ray emission in the field of a33 prompted us to obtain optical images and spectroscopic information for several objects in the field .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we present the basic information on the beppo - sax observation and data reduction . in section 3",
    "we describe the optical data and in section 4 we discuss the x - ray spectroscopy of the various sources in the a33 field .",
    "we summarize our results for a33 and discuss their implications in section 5 .    throughout the paper @xmath30=50 km",

    "we extracted the spectrum of 1saxj0027.0 - 1928 from a circular region of @xmath33 arcmin radius centered on the x - ray position of table 1 ( see fig.[figure : fig_9 ] ) .",
    "results of the fit are shown in table 5 ( uncertainties on the best fit values are given here at 68.3 @xmath34 confidence level .",
    "note that the spectrum of this source contains @xmath35 source photons ) .",
    "assuming an absorbed power  law non  thermal model , we derived a flux of @xmath36 .",
    "there are two galaxies , a spiral ( c ) at the same @xmath37 of a33 , and an elliptical ( d ) in the region for which we took an optical spectrum .",
    "the identification of the source is not certain at the moment . assuming that the galaxy d at @xmath38 is the x - ray emitter",
    ", its x - ray luminosity would be @xmath39 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "such an x - ray luminosity seems to be sensibly higher than the x - ray luminosity of a `` normal '' galaxy .",
    "the possibility that the x - ray emission is due to a more distant , unidentified object can not be excluded at present .",
    "in this paper we presented the first detailed x - ray observation of the distant abell cluster a33 , obtained with the beppo - sax satellite .",
    "we have closely examined and clarified the complex x - ray emission in the direction of a33 .",
    "the analysis of the x - ray data revealed the presence of three different x - ray sources in the field of a33 .",
    "the x - ray counterpart of the cluster is 1saxj0027.2 - 1930 .",
    "we present a spectroscopic redshift for a33 , applying a @xmath40 correction to the previous photometric estimate . from optical spectra of six cluster galaxies",
    "we measure a redshift @xmath41 and a velocity dispersion along the line of sight @xmath42=472@xmath43 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the dominant x - ray component ( incorrectly linked with a33 in the past ) is associated with a blend of an agn and m star , while the x - ray emission from a33 is @xmath7 times fainter . using the proper x - ray flux and measured redshift , we determine a more realistic cluster luminosity of @xmath44 erg s@xmath11 , one to two orders of magnitude lower than previous attempts .",
    "the mecs spectral resolution also allows us to determine that the intracluster gas temperature is @xmath45 kev .",
    "no useful information on the cluster abundance is given due to the low count rate of the source in the mecs detector .    in the following",
    "we will focus on measured quantities such as the low temperature and low velocity dispersion .",
    "we are dealing here with a moderately rich ( r=1 ) and distant ( d=3 ) abell cluster but with x - ray luminosity and temperature more typical of nearby ( z@xmath46 ) poor clusters .",
    "the temperature of a33 is commensurate with the predictions from its x - ray luminosity from the @xmath47 relation by david et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and arnaud and evrard ( 1999 ) .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the correlation between these two basic and measurable quantities ( edge & stewart 1991 , ebeling 1993 , david et al .",
    "1993 , fabian et al .",
    "1994 , mushotzky & scharf 1997 , markevitch 1998 , arnaud and evrard , 1999 ) . comparing the bolometric luminosity of a33 with the best fit relation , log(l@xmath48)@xmath6(2.88@xmath490.15 ) log(t/6kev )",
    "@xmath50(45.06@xmath490.03 ) obtained by arnaud and evrard ( 1999 ) , analyzing a sample of 24 low - z clusters with accurate temperature measurements and absence of strong cooling flows , we would expect for the a33 a temperature of 3.4 kev , as compared with our deduced value 2.9@xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath47 relation does not seem to evolve much with redshift since z@xmath60.4 ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) .",
    "note however that the asca data that they use show a strong bias at the low - luminosity end of the distribution due to the absence of objects in the lower luminosity range in the asca database .",
    "the present data on a cluster at about 0.2 are thus important to fill in the gap in the @xmath5 relationship found among rich clusters and groups ( see mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) .",
    "the measured velocity dispersion of a33 is also commensurate with the predictions from the @xmath52t@xmath48 relationship .",
    "a large number of authors ( see table 5 in girardi et al . , 1996 , or table 2 in wu , fang and xu , 1998 , for an exhaustive list of papers on the subject ) have attempted to determine the @xmath53 using different cluster samples in order to test the dynamical properties of clusters .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have derived a best fit relation between the velocity dispersion and the x - ray temperature , with more than 30@xmath34 reduced scatter with respect to previous work ( edge and stewart 1991 ; lubin and bahcall 1993 ; bird , mushotzky and metzler , 1995 ; wu , fang and xu 1998 , among others ) .",
    "if we substitute the temperature of 1saxj0027.2 - 1930 in the best fit relation log(@xmath54)@xmath6(2.53@xmath490.04)+(0.61@xmath490.05)log(t ) , derived by girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) a value of 650 km s@xmath11 would be expected for the 1-d velocity dispersion , somewhat higher but within the uncertainties of the measured value from six cluster members of a33 .",
    "if we assume energy equipartition between the galaxies and the gas in the cluster ( @xmath55@xmath61 ) and we use the measured temperature of 2.9 kev from the sax data in the equation @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 , for solar abundance ) , we obtain a velocity dispersion of @xmath58 km / s .",
    "the data for a33 are also consistent with the relation @xmath59 found by lubin & bahcall ( 1993 ) and increase its statistical significance in the low temperature ( @xmath60 kev ) range and at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath61 ) where only a few clusters have measured values of @xmath55 .",
    "this issue will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have also found that the bright source 1saxj0027.1 - 1926 has an extended appearance which is due to the blending of two different sources : an agn at @xmath62 and approximate b magnitude @xmath63 ( derived from the apparent b magnitude as given in the apm scans ) and an m - type star .",
    "the x - ray spectrum does not show any line features , and it is contaminated by the emission of the m star . given the low statistics we did not try to disentangle the two contributions but we consider an upper limit to the agn emission using the @xmath64 for the m star .",
    "the rosat bsc source found at a position consistent with the coordinates of 1saxj0027.1 - 1926 is most probably associated with the agn .",
    "the distance between the foreground agn and the cluster is @xmath65 . at the redshift of the agn",
    ", the observed total flux corresponds to a luminosity @xmath66 erg / s , which can be considered as an upper limit to the agn luminosity .",
    "we also detected a point - like faint source , 1saxj0027.0 - 1928 , for which no x - ray spectroscopic identification was possible .",
    "the @xmath67 kev spectrum of this source can be fitted by both thermal and non - thermal models ( see table 5 ) but we do not elaborate further given the poor statistics .",
