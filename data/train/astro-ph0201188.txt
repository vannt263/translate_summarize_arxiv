    "the pulsar psr b1706 - 44 is one of only seven that are known to emit gamma - rays in the gev energy range @xcite and one of only three that have been detected in the tev range @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the power law spectrum from the compact source at the site of the pulsar was best explained by synchrotron origin , presumably a nebula around the pulsar .",
    "@xcite found that psr b1706 - 44 is surrounded by a compact x - ray nebula of radius @xmath0 pc using _ asca _ data .",
    "this is also true of the other two tev emitters , the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "the tev gamma - rays , which appear to be unpulsed , can be explained as resulting from the inverse compton interaction of the high energy electrons , which produce the x - ray synchrotron emission , with ambient photons @xcite .",
    "the original discovery that the _ cos - b _ gamma - ray source was a pulsar was made by @xcite .",
    "the spin down luminosity is high , @xmath1  ergs , as would be expected .",
    "@xcite published a map made by the most telescope at 843  mhz of the area around the gamma - ray source .",
    "it showed a semicircular arc of emission , which has subsequently been denoted as the supernova remnant ( snr ) g343.1 - 2.3 , with the pulsar seemingly embedded in a small feature at its south eastern extremity .",
    "it was argued that the approximate distance of 3  kpc for the remnant , derived from the surface brightness - diameter relationship ( @xmath2-d ) was compatible with the pulsar s dispersion measure , although the distance indicated by the widely used interstellar electron density model of @xcite would be only 1.8  kpc .",
    "the @xmath2-d relationship was based on the flux density values from single dish observations , as both the vla and the most integrated flux fell short of what would be expected , implying that the broad structure was being resolved @xcite .",
    "if the association of the pulsar and the supernova remnant is real , a transverse velocity of @xmath3  kms@xmath4 is required for the pulsar to have moved from the approximate geometric centre of the snr arc in the characteristic spin down time of 17  kyr .",
    "this is high , but not the highest measured value for a pulsar , nor as high as that implied for some seemingly well - established pulsar - snr associations @xcite .",
    "@xcite imaged the area around the pulsar at 20  cm and 90  cm with the vla and cast doubt on its association with g343.1 - 2.3 .",
    "these arguments were based on the morphology , and the fact that the dispersion measure ( dm ) and @xmath2-d distance were discrepant .",
    "the latter was subsequently countered by a 21  cm hydrogen line absorption measurement of the pulsar by @xcite which gives a distance range of 2.4 to 3.2  kpc .",
    "most recently the region has been imaged in more detail by @xcite at 20 , 6 and 3.6  cm and they concurred with @xcite description of a nebula size of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite also argue against the association .",
    "they report a maximum value of only 27  kms@xmath4 for the magnitude of the transverse velocity of the pulsar calculated from the interstellar scintillation .",
    "however in their later paper @xcite , this estimate was revised up to 100  kms@xmath4 .",
    "the possibility of a direct determination of the proper motion of psr b1706 - 44 has been investigated , but no phase reference sufficiently strong for the current australian vlbi network ( the lba ) could be found .",
    "we have made a number of high sensitivity , low surface brightness images of the remnant to determine its full extent .",
    "furthermore we have used _",
    "archived data to search for a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) to provide evidence for the pulsar interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the australia telescope compact array has been used to re - observe g343.1 - 2.3 , with a nineteen pointing mosaic .",
    "mosaicing was required both to cover the extent of the source and also to assist in the recovery of the flux on the shortest _ uv _ spacings , which were missed in the most and the vla observations .",
    "primary calibration was against pks1934 - 638 which has an integrated flux of 16.4  jy at 1.384  ghz .",
    "the mean observing epoch was september 1998 .",
    "deconvolution used the mosaic version of the standard miriad maximum entropy methods for polarised images ; pmosmem .",
    "the rms noise in the final total intensity image is 0.6  mjy .",
    "figure [ fig : at_i ] shows the total intensity images of the whole remnant ( figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) and of the region around the psr ( figure [ fig : at_i ] b ) .",
    "the pulsar region is overlaid with the polarisation vectors .",
    "the full image is very similar to those from most @xcite , and indeed has very similar resolution ( @xmath6 ) ( the longer baselines , to the 6 km antenna , were not used due to the _ uv _ poor coverage ) .",
    "we have included as a constraint in the deconvolution the observed total flux for the snr , 30 jy , observed with the university of tasmania s 26 m antenna .    when the total flux from single dish measurements is included , the images obtained are in agreement with the other observations , i.e. the extent agrees with the very low frequency images from the vla @xcite and mrt @xcite , and the spectral index has a simple monotonic spectrum of -0.5 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : at_pol ] shows the polarisation angle overlaid on the polarised intensity .",
    "the polarised fraction is typically about 20 percent with a randomly orientated polarisation angle which changes rapidly around the bright ring .",
    "wisps of polarised emission can be seen to extend beyond the originally defined ring , and throughout the region with broadscale emission .",
    "this confirms that the broadscale emission is associated with the synchrotron emission from the snr .",
    "the pulsar is a point source with a flux density of 10  mjy , in line with that found in the scintillation fluctuation observations of @xcite , and is 70 per cent linearly polarised , and 25 per cent circularly polarised .",
    "the mean pulsar position is 17:09:42.71 -44:29:08.1 with an rms of 0.5 arc seconds between epochs , within the errors estimates of @xcite , but is slightly south of the vla observations ; that is -44:29:06.6 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the vla images of @xcite with the image in figure [ fig : at_i ] b ) .",
    "the pulsar lies on a spur of emission which is clearly a continuous feature covering more than @xmath7 .",
    "thus it is extremely unlikely to be a cometary tail from the pulsar .",
    "furthermore the width of the spur , @xmath8 , is too broad to be due to ram pressure of a moving pulsar .",
    "it is intriguing that this is approximately the size that would be expected from a static pulsar wind , derived from the sedov equations with a continuous input of energy , and with the @xmath9 of psr1706 - 44 @xcite . taking the expressions from @xcite ,",
    "the equation of the static shock radius ( @xmath10 ) is ;    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the spin down energy in unit of @xmath13  ergs  s@xmath4 , @xmath14 is the number density , @xmath15 is the age in @xmath16 years and @xmath17 is the distance in kpc . using the standard values",
    "gives @xmath18 using the lower limit on the distance .",
    "the formula for a ram pressure shock driven pwn ( @xmath19 ) is ;    @xmath20    or @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the velocity in units of 150 kms@xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that the radius of the feature seen in the radio band can not be due to the ram pressure shock unless the density is extremely low ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the size expected for a static pwn , with a number density of the order suggested by the analysis of the _ rosat _ data , i.e. 0.09  @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these observations are contaminated by the nearby low mass x - ray binary , lmxb  1705 - 44 , but a best fit of a thermal spectrum to the x - ray emission from the snr gives a distance of 3.1  kpc , and an age of 8.9  kyrs .",
    "these values are derived using the x - ray luminosity to distance model of @xcite .",
    "the local density based on the pulsar age is 0.09  @xmath24 , whilst that from the sedov model age is 0.02  @xmath24 .",
    "we took 48 ksecs of _ hrc _ data and 17 ksecs of _ acis _ data from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory archive and imaged the region around the pulsar .",
    "these observations were made in august and february 2000 , with roll angles 180@xmath25 apart . a similar low surface brightness",
    "extended feature is clearly visible in both the _ hrc _ and the _ acis _ data , as first reported by @xcite .",
    "their _ asca _ observations , complicated by contamination from the bright lmxb  1705 - 44 , saw evidence for a 1433@xmath26 compact nebula in the radial surface brightness .",
    "the feature as seen by _",
    "chandra _ as it is visible in both data sets , can not be due to the space craft dither , nor due to a soft proton flare or any other random and unrelated event .",
    "we have found the peak energy of the pulsar emission to be around 1 kev from the _ acis _ data , and have ` cleaned ' the _ hrc _ data ( smoothed to 0.3@xmath26 ) with the psf for that energy .",
    "clean is a standard deconvolution technique where a small fraction of the psf is subtracted interatively from the image , until a conversion condition is met @xcite .",
    "our convergence criterion was satisfied when the peak emission was more than half the psf width from the pulsar position .",
    "significant emission ( 10 percent of peak ) remained at this point .",
    "it was perfectly feasible to clean this feature iteratively as well , but equally good results were obtained by fitting a gaussian model around the pulsar position .",
    "figure [ fig : chandra ] shows the emission after the cleaning the point source with the psf ; its position is marked with a cross .",
    "this confirms the object seen by @xcite , but finds a two dimensional structure and a smaller extent which can be explained by the degree of contamination in the asca image .",
    "the object has a very compact nebula ( but much greater than the psf ) around the pulsar which is best fitted by a gaussian of about 1.1@xmath27 , and a more tenuous trail pointing nor - north west , and extending about 5@xmath26 back from the pulsar .",
    "the angle of symmetry of this tail is @xmath28 , toward the snr centre .",
    "the brightness of the tenuous nebula is about 10 times greater than that of the point spread function of the _ chandra _ mirrors ; i.e. 1 percent of the pulsar peak , whereas the psf would be 0.1 percent .",
    "the most likely , and most natural , physical model of such a structure is a bow shock , with the more tenuous tail left behind in the wake .    the pulsar to bow shock distance at the closest approach ( @xmath29 ) , at 2.4 kpc , is just 0.05 pc .",
    "if the scintillation velocity limit found by @xcite is correct then the density is required to be greater than 25  @xmath24 , or , if the densities are those found from the _ rosat _ observations @xcite , the velocities are in the range 10002000  kms@xmath4 , greater than that required to move from the centre of the snr to the current position .",
    "more typical densities imply reasonable velocities ( 500 kms@xmath4 implies a density of unity ) .",
    "these are obviously much higher that those seen by the scintillation velocity , but we stress that this is an indirect measurement with a large intrinsic scatter , and only a vlbi observation will settle the question , for which the lba will need to be upgraded .    from the _ hrc _ image we cleaned out 294 counts for the pulsar before the convergence criterion was reached .",
    "the integrated x - ray flux from the compact nebula is 390 counts and the tenuous tail is 120 counts .",
    "we fitted a number of models to the _ acis _ data in sherpa 2.2 .",
    "the best fit to the source spectrum was found with joint fitting of the two sources ; the region around the pulsar as a black body plus a power law portion and the pwn as an independent power law .",
    "these were attenuated with the usual column density absorption .",
    "the fact that the same spectrum could not be fitted to both features confirms that it is not the result of incorrectly removed spacecraft dither .",
    "the model fits for the black body can be used to calculate the diameter of the emission region from the normalisation constant ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "using the hi  distance limits gives the radius of the emitting region as @xmath31@xmath32  km .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray flux gives the range of intrinsic luminosities to be 5.47.1  @xmath33  ergs  s@xmath4 from the black body ( presumably the pulsar ) and 7.69.9  @xmath33  ergs  s@xmath4 from the power law regions ( the pwn ) .",
    "the fits are shown in figure [ fig : x - ray ] .",
    "the reduced chi - squared is 0.6 and a q - statistic of 99% , implying that the errors have been underestimated .",
    "the column densities agree with those from the _ rosat _ observations @xcite .",
    "the fitted model parameters are ;    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "initially the arguments against the association were based on kaspi s criteria @xcite .",
    "these can be summarised in order of ease of observability as ; same position , same distance , same age , velocity reasonable and proper motion correct .",
    "it was felt that the pulsar dm distance and the snr @xmath2-d distance did not match , and the pulsar was at the edge of the snr and had too low a velocity to have travelled from the geometric centre of the snr .",
    "also there was no morphological evidence to imply a velocity direction , and the scintillation velocity was too low .",
    "since then work @xcite has shown that the dm distance was incorrect , and our atca observations have found that the extent of the snr has been underestimated .",
    "the chandra data shows a morphological signature best interpreted as the path of the pulsar .",
    "the proper motion of the pulsar is the remaining question , and work is under way to attempt to answer that .",
    "it is clear from both the low total flux values found by the most and vla maps that there is a smooth broad component to this snr .",
    "the atca observations confirm the extent of the broad emission , and that this is non - thermal in character . taking this smooth component as the true limits of the snr enlarges the extent and moves it southwards .",
    "this places the pulsar psr1706 - 44 within the snr shell , rather than on the rim , thus satisfying kaspi s first criteria .",
    "the x - ray pwn observed by _",
    "chandra _ is consistent with the pulsar travelling from the general direction of the snr centre , with either a very slow velocity ( which would agree with the scintillation results ) or a low local density ( in agreement with the _ rosat _ results ) .    we expect a snr to be associated with psr1706 - 44 because of its youth .",
    "the association with g343.1 - 2.3 was rejected in the past , but we have shown that the grounds for the rejection are not compelling",
    ". the question of the pulsar velocity could be resolved by finding a phase reference for vlbi observation , with either the ska or an upgrade to the current lba .",
    "we will be able to rule out the upper velocity limits with the atca within the next few years but will not be able to measure the lower limits for a few decades .    finally the result stresses the importance of improving the rosat observations of this snr with a mosaic over the whole area of the radio emission using either _ chandra _ or _ xmm_.",
    "during the writing of this paper k.r .",
    "anantharamaiah of the rri passed away .",
    "both of us trained as astronomers there , and wish to acknowledge his friendly encouragement and interest that persuaded us that radio astronomy is a rewarding and exciting field .",
    "the x - ray data for the chandra observations were downloaded from the public access site , the chandra data archive ( cda ) .",
    "this is part of the chandra x - ray observatory science center ( cxc ) which is operated for nasa by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory .",
    "the australia telescope compact array , funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility , is managed by csiro .",
