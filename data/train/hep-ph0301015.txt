    "the unification of the gauge couplings in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories leads one to entertain the possibility that the three gauge groups of the standard model unify into a simple grand unified group .",
    "computations within this framework have shown that the low - energy gauge couplings are not only compatible with supersymmetric unification , but are predicted accurately to within expected slop of a sensible high - scale theory .",
    "any unified theory of the leptons and quarks gives a symmetry reason for their masses once the unified theory is broken and parameters are renormalized to the low scale where we take measurements .",
    "the pressing issue then is to use what we know to posit more complete forms of the high - scale theory in order to make more predictions and identify more tests for consistency .",
    "we have mild clues to the form of the high - scale theory .",
    "first , the unification of gauge couplings works provided the hypercharge of each state is normalized as though it came from @xmath4 breaking .",
    "this makes any simple group which has an @xmath4 subgroup up for primary consideration , such as @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    "second , the existence of neutrino masses gives preference to theories that naturally incorporate the left and right neutrinos into simple representations .",
    "for this reason , we wish to focus on @xmath0 , which is the smallest rank symmetry group that pays full respect to these two clues .",
    "the simplest models of @xmath0 have complete unification of the third family yukawa couplings at the high scale .",
    "this requirement implies the well - known criterion that @xmath2 should be large ( about 50 )  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 is large , the renormalization group evolution of the theory parameters ( gauge couplings and yukawa couplings ) can only be done accurately by two - loop numerical computations .",
    "the numerics are somewhat messy , and so the hope was originally that the issue of yukawa coupling unification could be elucidated by a compensatingly easy form of supersymmetry with few parameters .",
    "for example , one would have like to have seen how it all works for `` minimal supergravity '' , where all the gauginos have the same mass at the high scale and all scalars have the same mass at the high scale .",
    "unfortunately , this simple model fails to simultaneously allow yukawa unification and electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .    the lack of simple analytics to analyze yukawa unification and the failure of a simple model to exemplify it has created a little confusion ( for us , at least ) on whether third family yukawa unification is a reasonable expectation .",
    "the question has been studied by several groups in the past ( for very recent papers , see refs.@xcite ) ; however , we are revisiting it because experimental input data on the strong coupling , the top mass , and the bottom mass has improved dramatically in the past few years , there are some discrepancies in the @xmath6 unification literature  @xcite , and the theoretical palette of supersymmetric models has grown .",
    "we also believe we have an effective way of showing in a semi - model - independent fashion what the requirements , and challenges , are for yukawa unification , and we believe we have identified a general approach to the superpartner spectrum that is worth considering as a solution to the yukawa unification problem .",
    "we illustrate the effectiveness of this approach within anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "when @xmath2 is very high there is an extreme sensitivity of low - energy parameters on the high - scale prediction of yukawa unification .",
    "this might sound vaguely disturbing at first , but in fact it is an opportunity we can exploit to narrow the low - scale options that work . in contrast , extreme ultraviolet sensitivity would be disastrous to progress since it would not matter what shuffling of parameters we do at the low scale , their effects would all be dwarfed by high - scale uncertainties .",
    "we will demonstrate the infrared and ultraviolet sensitivity of the predictions below .",
    "we also hope to demonstrate a somewhat easier method to characterize the success or failure of third family yukawa coupling unification . in the end , we hope we will have demonstrated two important conclusions to the reader : third family yukawa unification is compatible with low - scale supersymmetry , but the low - scale finite corrections to the bottom quark must be smaller than naive expectations would have them be .",
    "this latter point translates into the requirements that large low - scale susy threshold corrections must either cancel to give a moderate or small - sized correction to the @xmath1-quark mass , or they must be greatly suppressed .",
    "when we discuss additional constraints on the low - scale spectrum from experiment , the suppression explanation will look more tenable in our view .    in order to understand how important the low - energy susy corrections are for yukawa unification ,",
    "we first show approximate expression of the gut couplings , which depend on the low - energy susy corrections .",
    "the expressions for the gauge couplings are @xmath7 where the scale @xmath8 should be close to the gut scale @xmath9 gev , defined to be the location where @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a threshold correction at gut scale , and @xmath12 are deviations from the sm gauge couplings at @xmath13 due to susy contributions . the uncertainties in the gauge coupling measurements at the @xmath3 scale are also included in @xmath14 and must be taken into account when considering the predictions for unification .",
    "this is particularly true for the strong coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "the parameterization of yukawa threshold corrections is @xmath16 which keeps track of the deviations from the naive two higgs doublet yukawa couplings at @xmath13 due to susy contributions ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "similar to the gauge coupling parameters @xmath14 , the yukawa unification parameters take into account also the uncertainty of the fermion mass measurements .",
    "this is particularly important for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as their uncertainties are comparable to susy threshold corrections .",
    "note that @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) as defined by eqns .",
    "( [ dr - yukawa])-([yukawa_correction ] ) in the appendix .",

    "we can do a similar exercise for yukawa couplings at a high - scale @xmath8 near @xmath24 to see qualitative features of yukawa unification .",
    "many numerical coefficients are highly sensitive to @xmath2 and we have therefore expanded our results around @xmath23 since we know that is near what @xmath2 needs to be for third family unification to occur .",
    "the yukawa couplings are then given by @xmath25    these expression should not be used in quantitative analysis because @xmath26 corrections to yukawa couplings are not negligible .",
    "but they do demonstrate interesting qualitative features . for gauge couplings",
    ", unification is not terribly sensitive to low energy susy corrections ( i.e. , the coefficients of @xmath27 and @xmath14 are small ) . on the other hand ,",
    "yukawa couplings at the gut scale are very sensitive to the low - energy susy corrections .",
    "an @xmath28 correction at low energies can generate close to a @xmath29 correction at the gut scale .",
    "this extreme ir sensitivity is one source of the variance in conclusions in the literature  @xcite .",
    "for example , course - grained scatter plot methods , which are so useful in other circumstances , lose some of their utility when ir sensitivity is so high .",
    "furthermore , analyses that use only central values of measured fermion masses do not give a full picture of what range of supersymmetry parameter space enables third family yukawa unification , since small deviations in low - scale parameters can mean so much to the high - scale theory viability .",
    "we can make progress in understanding unification of the yukawa couplings prior to positing a specific set of supersymmetric masses , and even prior to agreeing on a supersymmetry breaking framework .",
    "the technique we utilize is to consider the susy corrections @xmath30 as free parameters .",
    "we vary @xmath30 and @xmath2 at @xmath13 , and search for @xmath6 yukawa coupling unification at the gut scale . for this analysis",

    "more to the point : how can we get small @xmath56 with such a large @xmath41 ?",
    "we have made statements in the previous section that when @xmath41 and superpartner masses are below about @xmath33 tev we expect @xmath1 quark mass corrections to be much higher than the @xmath56 required for third family unification . a quick way to see",
    "this is in the contributions to the finite corrections which scales as ^finite_b - + +  if all superpartner masses are about the same , we see that each term contributes about @xmath57   @xcite with the sign depending on the relative sign of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    to reduce the size of this correction to the @xmath56 level one needs to either cancel large individual terms in the formulas for the corrections , or suppress the corrections . in our view",
    ", the appeal of the first option is diminished , but not ruled out , when we contemplate the strong correlation between large susy contributions to @xmath35 and large susy contributions to @xmath60 .    we know from experiment that the decay rate @xmath60 is consistent with the standard model  @xcite , and weak - scale supersymmetry ( masses less than about a tev ) with large @xmath2 supersymmetry generally is wildly in conflict with it .",
    "there are two ways out of this problem : the large individual susy corrections , including @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 loop corrections , could conspire to cancel each other for a small total effect , or these same loop corrections could be so large that they are almost exactly twice the size of the sm amplitude , but opposite in sign so that the overall observable is not altered . this possibility is still allowed by the data , although future measurements of the fb asymmetry of @xmath64 would distinguish the sign of the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the terms in the @xmath60 computation are very similar to the terms in the @xmath35 computation .",
    "they both involve loops of charginos and stops , and loops of gluinos and sbottoms ( if supersymmetric ckm matrix is different than ckm matrix ) , but the coefficients and couplings are different",
    ". a cancellation of supersymmetric effects in one does not by any means imply a cancellation in the other .",
    "therefore , it is perhaps reasonable for a low - scale supersymmetric model with @xmath41 to conspire to give small corrections to either @xmath60 or to @xmath35 , but we view it as unlikely that cancellations occur for both observables .",
    "we are next led to the explanation that @xmath35 is small because all terms contributing to it are suppressed .",
    "it has been pointed out that an approximate @xmath65 symmetry or pq symmetry can systematically suppress both @xmath35 and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "both computations go to zero as supersymmetric parameters carrying @xmath65-symmetry charge ( gaugino masses and @xmath66 terms ) go to zero , and both computations go to zero if terms carrying pq charge ( the @xmath67 term ) go to zero .",
    "the constraints from @xmath60 are very severe at @xmath41 . if all superpartner masses are less than 1 tev it is challenging to envision a superpartner spectrum capable of suppressing individual contributions enough to not require a rather large beneficial cancellation ( conspiracy of amplitude signs ) to occur in the finite @xmath1-quark to allow yukawa unification . and",
    "in addition , we simultaneously need equivalently large contributions to the @xmath60 amplitude to cancel or add with just the right strengths to recover the magnitude of the sm amplitude but with opposite sign .",
    "the problem of making relatively light supersymmetry compatible with yukawa coupling unification was taken up in the excellent study by blaek , derm ' iek and raby ( bdr )  @xcite .",
    "the bdr approach is within a model of unified scalar mass @xmath68 at the high scale for all states in the 16 representation ( squarks , sleptons , sneutrinos ) , split higgs masses within the 10 representation , and unified gaugino masses @xmath69 at the gut scale .",
    "they find that in order for third family yukawa unification to occur the susy parameters must have the following properties :    * @xmath70 for the third generation yukawa couplings to approach unification .",
    "* @xmath71 to suppress , but not to zero , the gluino contributions to @xmath35 and @xmath72 .",
    "* large @xmath73 such that the weak - scale @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 and the positive chargino - stop contributions to @xmath35 cancels , and slightly overcomes , the large negative contributions due to gluino - sbottoms finite and logarithmic corrections .",
    "( note , we are expressing this criteria in our sign convention for @xmath1-quark corrections which is opposite to bdr sign convention : @xmath76 ) .",
    "* @xmath77 so that the large chargino - stop corrections to @xmath60 can be opposite in sign to sm ( and charged higgs ) contributions .",
    "this is necessary to be consistent with the large choice of @xmath73 term above , which when combined with the right sign of @xmath67 gives the chargino - stop loops a sufficiently large canceling contribution to change the sign of the @xmath60 amplitude .",
    "this enables large @xmath2 supersymmetry to be consistent with the @xmath78 measurements despite the susy contributions being much larger than the sm contributions .    the above criteria for third generation yukawa unification may seem tortured to the uninitiated , but we can verify after much technical work in hopes of finding something `` better '' that the bdr solution is the right approach if supersymmetry is relatively light .",
    "it is remarkable how robustly unique of a general solution approach it turns out to be , and we concur with bdr on its interesting phenomenological predictions , such as @xmath79 gev , @xmath80 , etc .",
    "there is one disquieting feature of the bdr solution that one might call `` finetuned cloaking of large @xmath2 effects . ''",
    "it is unsettling to expect that there is a nice conspiracy of large effects coming out just right ( and more or less sm - like ) for @xmath1-quark finite corrections and @xmath60 corrections .",
    "large corrections would not be a cause for any concern whatsoever",
    ". however , large corrections that cancel to yield small @xmath1-quark corrections and add just the right amount to suppress or flip the sign of the @xmath60 amplitude such that we would see no deviation from the sm may be too much to ask of a theory .",
    "there are other , perhaps just as severe , challenges to the bdr solution",
    ". there may be another conspiracy involved in getting @xmath81 to work out properly .",
    "however , as bdr have pointed out , it is generally less severe than @xmath60 considerations , and the required choice of @xmath82 at least goes in the preferred direction for @xmath81 . a more difficult challenge would be to get acceptable dark matter solutions .",
    "when scalar masses are much larger than gaugino masses , the relic abundance of the stable lightest neutralino is typically much too large to be acceptable .",
    "additional tunings of the spectrum and parameters would be required to make this work out properly .",
    "for example , just the right mixture of higgsino and bino components to the lightest neutralino would guarantee any amount of dark matter one wishes , but this requires a somewhat sensitive tuning between @xmath69 and @xmath67 .",
    "annihilations of the lightest neutralino through a heavy higgs pole is another viable option to suppress relic abundance in high @xmath2 theories of this sort  @xcite , but it requires the heavy higgs states to be relatively light in contradistinction to other scalars in the theory .",
    "nevertheless , the large @xmath2 suppression of the pseudoscalar mass with respect to lagrangian parameters is encouraging for this scenario .",
    "we would like to discuss another solution to third generation yukawa unification that involves no finetuned cloaking of the large @xmath2 effects .",
    "as the overall scale of supersymmetry breaking increases , the supersymmetric effects in @xmath60 ( and @xmath81 ) decouple to zero",
    ". however , the finite and logarithmic threshold corrections to the yukawa couplings do not decouple .",
    "logarithmic corrections to @xmath35 and @xmath38 are negative and can be over 10% for squark masses above several tev .",
    "the logarithmic corrections to @xmath36 are negligible ( less than 1% ) .",
    "large negative corrections to @xmath35 go in the wrong direction for yukawa unification , and if they stood alone would invalidate the hypothesis of third generation yukawa unification consistent with reasonable high - scale threshold corrections .",
    "once we realize that there are negative and large irrepressible logarithmic corrections to @xmath35 and @xmath38 it becomes clear that moderately valued finite corrections ( about 10% to 20% ) to @xmath35 from gluino - squark loops must be present .",
    "this is a very reasonable request of the theory since the @xmath35 corrections depend only on ratios of masses and not on the overall scale of supersymmetry breaking : @xmath83 .",
    "this non - decoupling property of the finite @xmath1 quark mass corrections is what allows us to suppress large @xmath2 effects in potentially dangerous observables and yet get large enough finite @xmath1-quark mass corrections to obtain viable third family yukawa unification .",
    "the solution described above is transparently natural in every way except electroweak symmetry breaking might be finetuned because we need large scalar masses .",
    "for example , stop masses above a few tev are needed for this solution to be realized in a way that naturally satisfies large @xmath2 sensitive observables , such as @xmath60 .",
    "we have identified anomaly mediated gaugino masses and @xmath66 terms  @xcite as a theoretical scenario which may naturally realize this approach to third generation yukawa unification .",
    "we utilize several features of this idea to our benefit .",
    "if no singlets are around to transmit supersymmetry breaking , the gaugino masses and @xmath66 terms ( dimension 3 susy breaking terms ) may primarily arise via anomaly mediation and are approximately one - loop suppressed compared to the gravitino mass , and hence the @xmath66 terms are naturally the size of the gaugino masses .",
    "we also remind the readers that although the gaugino mass relations in anomaly mediation do not look like they have any connection to a gut theory , they are in fact perfectly consistent with a gut unified gaugino mass .",
    "the odd splitting of gaugino masses below the gut scale comes from large gauge - mediated threshold corrections from integrating out heavy gut states .",
    "the `` magic '' of anomaly mediation is that these corrections are precisely what is needed to recover the scale - invariant expressions for the gaugino masses at low energy .    on the other hand",
    ", the scalars can naturally get masses of the order the gravitino mass because @xmath84 scalar mass - squareds do not require singlets .",
    "scalar masses may be suppressed somewhat with respect to gravitino mass if the khler potential approaches the no - scale form  @xcite .",
    "we therefore make the general observation that anomaly mediation is most naturally manifest by gauginos much lighter than scalars , although the precise ratio between them depends on a priori incalculable aspects of the theory ( i.e. , the khler potential ) .    to illustrate how yukawa unification works in this scenario we normalize the anomaly mediated gaugino masses to @xmath85 gev .",
    "this is well above the experimental limits .",

    "the compatibility with gauge coupling unification is assured , compatibility with all dangerous chirality - flipping observables is assured , and the lsp is retained as a viable dark matter candidate .",
