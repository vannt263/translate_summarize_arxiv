    "the braid group @xmath3 on a 2-disk @xmath4 was firstly introduced by e.  artin in 1920 s , and fox and neuwirth generalized it to braid groups @xmath0 on arbitrary topological spaces @xmath1 via _ configuration spaces _ , which are defined as follows . for a compact , connected topological space @xmath1 , the _ ordered configuration space @xmath5 _",
    "is the set of @xmath6-tuples of distinct points in @xmath1 , and the orbit space @xmath7 under the action of the symmetric group @xmath8 on @xmath5 permutting coordinates is called the _ unordered configuration space _ on @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10    let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be basepoints for @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively . then the _ pure @xmath6-braid group _ @xmath13 and _ ( full ) @xmath6-braid group @xmath14 _ are defined to be the fundamental groups of the configuration spaces @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we will suppress basepoints and denote these groups by @xmath15 and @xmath0 unless any ambiguity occurs .",
    "however , most of research on braid groups has been focused on braid groups on manifolds , more specifically , on surfaces , until the end of 20th century when ghrist presented a pioneering paper @xcite about braid groups on _ graphs @xmath16 _ which are finite , 1-dimensional simplicial complexes . in 2000 , abrams defined in his ph .",

    "a discrete configuration space has the benefit that it admits a cubical complex structure making the description of paths of points easier .",

    ", kim - ko - park in @xcite and ko - park in @xcite provided geometric criteria for the braid group on a given graph to be right - angled artin , and moreover a new algebraic criterion for the planarity of a graph , and answered some open questions as well .    on the contrary , for a simplicial complex ,",
    "not manifold , of dimension 2 or higher , braid theory is still unexplored .",
    "we will focus on the braid groups on finite , connected simplicial complex @xmath1 of arbitrary dimension , which are generalizations of both graphs and surfaces .",
    "we consider modifications  attaching or removing higher cells , edge contraction or inverses , and so on and how these modifications change the braid groups . indeed , via suitable modifications we may obtain a _",

    "once we have a simple complex @xmath1 , then it can be decomposed by _ cuts _ into much simpler pieces , and eventually into _ elementary _ complexes , where an elementary complex plays the role of a building block and can be thought as either a _ star _ graph or a manifold of dimension at least 2 . for the build - up process , we provide two types of _ combination theorem _ which are generalizations of capping - off and connected sum .",
    "furthermore , the combination theorems ensure that the build - up process preserves some geometry of the given pieces .",
    "in other words , the braid group @xmath0 captures some geometric properties of @xmath1 as observed before .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we define braid groups on complexes and basic notions . in section  3 , we define the modifications and prove theorem  [ thm : simple ] , and in section  4 we define two operations , called _ unwrapping _ and _ connected - sum decomposition _ , and look at the shapes of the elementary complexes .",
    "the effects of the inverses , called _ closure _ and _ connected sum _ , of these two operations on braid groups will be discussed separately in section  5 and section  6 , which they let us know how the build - up process is working . finally , in section 7 , as applications we prove the criteria , theorem  [ thm : emb ] , for the embeddability of given complex @xmath1 into a surface and a plane .",
    "throughout this paper , a _ complex _ denoted by @xmath1 means a finite , connected , simplicial complex of dimension at least 1 .",
    "especially , a complex of dimension 1 is usually denoted by @xmath16 and called a _",
    "graph_. since the braid group on @xmath1 depends only on the homeomorphism type of @xmath1 , we sometimes assume that @xmath1 is _ sufficiently subdivided _ , which can be achieved via the barycentric subdivision twice .",
    "the _ star _",
    "@xmath36 is the union of all open simplices whose closure intersects @xmath37 , and the _ link _ @xmath38 of @xmath37 is the complement of the star @xmath39 of the closure @xmath40 in its closure @xmath41 .",
    "that is , @xmath42 , as usual .",
    "note that both @xmath5 and @xmath7 can be regarded as finite simplicial complexes up to homotopy as follows .",
    "since @xmath1 is a finite simplicial complex , so is the @xmath6-fold product @xmath43 , and after barycentric subdivisions if necessary , the diagonal @xmath44 becomes a simplicial subcomplex of @xmath43 .",
    "hence the further subdivision makes @xmath45 a strong deformation retract of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore if we endow a metric @xmath47 on @xmath1 , we may assume that there exists a constant @xmath48 such that any two points of @xmath49 never approach within @xmath50 of each other with respect to the metric @xmath47 , and the same holds for @xmath7 .    from the definitions of configuration spaces",
    ", we have the following exact sequence . @xmath51 here the group @xmath52 is the symmetric group on the set @xmath12 , usually denoted by @xmath8 , and the map @xmath53 is called the _ induced permutation_. it is easy to see that @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that @xmath53 for @xmath56 on a tripod @xmath27 is surjective for each @xmath57 .",

    "we call @xmath1 _ trivial _ if @xmath1 is either @xmath59 or @xmath60",
    ". then @xmath27 can be thought as the obstruction complex for given complex to be trivial . from now on we assume that @xmath1 is non - trivial .    for any @xmath61 , there is a trichotemy as follows .    1 .",

    "a _ deletion @xmath74 of @xmath37 _ in @xmath1 is defined by the complement @xmath75 of @xmath36 .",
    "the figure  [ fig : intboundarybranch ] shows an example .",
    "the thin lines and dots are in @xmath68 , and the thick lines are in @xmath66 .",
    "note that @xmath68 is a closed subcomplex of @xmath1 , and @xmath1 is a manifold if and only if @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite let @xmath77 be a manifold of dimension at least @xmath78 , not necessarily compact and possibly with boundary .",
    "then the pure and full braid groups are as follows .",
    "@xmath79 where the symmetric group @xmath8 acts on the product @xmath80 by permuting factors .",
    "hence there is no braid theory for manifolds of dimension 3 or higher . on the other hand , for a surface @xmath81 , then there is a fiber bundle structures between the ordered configuration spaces @xmath82 s which can be used to compute and analyze braid groups on @xmath81 .",
    "note that since compact surfaces are completely characterized by a few parameters , so are their braid groups .",
    "indeed , for a given surface @xmath81 , one can extract geometric information from its braid group as follows .",
    "the proof is obvious by the group presentation for @xmath83 , see @xcite , and we omit the proof .",
    "@xcite[thm : surface ] let @xmath81 be a surface .",
    "then the following holds .    1",
    ".   @xmath83 has torsion if and only if @xmath81 is either @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the abelianization @xmath84 has torsion if and only if @xmath81 is nonplanar .    on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath1 is not a manifold , the global topology for a complex @xmath1 can hardly be determined by a few parameters in general , even if @xmath1 is 1-dimensional .",
    "therefore one might not expect that similar results hold for @xmath1 , but surprisingly , the braid group still detects some of the global geometry of the complex @xmath1 when @xmath1 is a graph @xmath16 as follows .",
    "@xcite let @xmath16 be a graph .",
    "then @xmath17 is _ always _ torsion free , and moreover @xmath85 has torsion if and only if @xmath16 is nonplanar .",
    "hence theorem  [ thm : emb ] is the generalization of the two theorems above , and to prove our theorem , we adopt the notion from graph theory which is the mimic of the _ minor _ relation , that is , edge contraction and deletion . note that the minor relations reduce the number of edges and so the result is usually considered as simpler than the original one .",
    "however , they may increase valencies , and the higher valency tends to imply a more complicated situation in the computation of the braid group .",
    "therefore we may think that a complex having lower valencies is simpler .",
    "rigorously speaking , we define a simple complex as follows .    a vertex @xmath69 is said to be _ simple _ if @xmath71 is either connected , a disjoint union of a connected complex and a point , or 0-dimensional .",
    "a complex @xmath1 is said to be _ simple _ if all vertices in @xmath1 are simple .",
    "hence a simple complex is really easy to handle , but is too special and far from the generic ones .",
    "however , we claim that any complex can be transformed into a simple complex by a sequence of certain modifications such as attaching and removing ( higher ) cells , where each step induces an isomorphism between braid groups .    for convenience s sake",
    ", we say that an embedding @xmath86 is a _ braid equivalence _ if it induces an isomorphism @xmath87 for each @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "since @xmath1011 is generated by two braid relations which can be considered as 3- or 4-braids , it is generated by the images of @xmath1012 and @xmath1013 under the maps @xmath1014 for @xmath1015 or @xmath1016 . therefore @xmath1017 is also generated by these images of them under the compositions with @xmath1018 .",
    "let @xmath1019 be _ oriented _ disks , and @xmath1020 be the boundary wedge sum of @xmath1019 s where @xmath1021 . by proposition  [ prop : edgecontraction ]",

    "moreover , even for @xmath35 , the kernel of @xmath1032 is generated by the image of @xmath1030 under the inclusion map @xmath1033 coming from proposition  [ prop : injection ] .",
    "this follows easily from the group presentations for @xmath1034 and @xmath3 .    as before ,",
    "let us consider a local deformation @xmath961 of type @xmath1028 via @xmath189 .",
    "note that @xmath22 can be regarded intuitively as a blowing - up of @xmath1 at @xmath69 , and there are two possibilities for constructing @xmath22 according to the choices of the orientations on @xmath1019 s .",

    ". then @xmath1051 can never be a braid equivalence since their fundamental groups are different .",
