    "sample paths properties of stochastic processes are widely studied since the 1970s ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as foundational works ) .",
    "this field of research is still very active and a non - exhaustive list of authors and recent works includes dalang ( @xcite ) , khoshnevisan ( @xcite,@xcite ) , lawler ( @xcite ) , mountford(@xcite ) , xiao ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , etc . among the variety of measures of regularity , pointwise and local hlder exponents are the most recurrent tools used in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , these two exponents ( and as well the moduli of continuity ) lack of stability under ( pseudo-)differential operators or multiplication by a power function , and therefore do not completely characterize the local regularity of a function or a stochastic process at a given point .",
    "simple examples can illustrate these issues .",
    "consider the deterministic `` chirp '' function @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are positive real numbers . as described in @xcite , this function has a non - trivial regularity at @xmath3 . indeed , its pointwise and local hlder exponents at @xmath3 ( see section 2 for definitions ) are equal to @xmath4 using notations from @xcite , @xmath5 denotes @xmath6 fractional integration of order @xmath7 .",
    "then , the pointwise and hlder exponents of @xmath8 at @xmath3 are known to be equal to @xmath9 similarly , the study of the local regularity of the function @xmath10 leads to @xmath11 hence , in both cases one can observe that the behaviour of local regularity of @xmath12 and @xmath13 can not be completely deduced from pointwise and local hlder exponents of @xmath6 ( it does not correspond to a simple translation of coefficient @xmath7 ) .",
    "this deterministic example can be easily transposed into a stochastic context using multifractional brownian motion , a gaussian process introduced in @xcite and @xcite and applied as probabilistic model in different fields ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this process , denoted @xmath14 is parametrized by a deterministic function @xmath15 and has interesting regularity properties . in the particular case of a so - called regularity function set to @xmath16 and under some conditions on coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the regularity of @xmath14 at @xmath3 almost surely satisfies @xmath19 proving that stochastic processes can also have non - trivial behaviours(see @xcite ) .",
    "these two different examples illustrate the fact that pointwise and local hlder exponents are not sufficient to describe entirely the local regularity of a deterministic function or the sample paths of a stochastic process . in this context , _ 2-microlocal analysis _ is a tool that provides a finer characterization .",
    "in particular , it allows to describe how pointwise and local exponents evolve under the action of ( pseudo-)differential operators and under multiplication by power functions .",
    "if it has been first introduced in a deterministic frame ( pde precisely , see @xcite ) , a stochastic approach has been recently developed in @xcite .",
    "this previous work exhibited a kolmogorov - like criterion which gives an almost surely lower bound for the 2-microlocal frontier of a stochastic process .",
    "it also focused on the regularity of gaussian processes at a fixed point @xmath20 .",
    "thereby , the regularity of a gaussian process @xmath21 at any fixed @xmath3 is almost surely characterized by its incremental variance @xmath22}}^2 $ ] . in particular",
    ", when considering the following wiener integral @xmath23 it implies that the regularity of its sample paths is described by the behaviour of the deterministic function @xmath24 .",
    "given this result , a natural goal is to generalize the statement to any stochastic integral @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a progressive continuous process and @xmath27 is a local continuous martingale .",
    "in fact , we first prove in theorem [ th : mg_vq ] a uniform result on continuous martingales which links up the regularity of the process to the regularity of its quadratic variation . in the specific case of stochastic integrals ,",
    "this 2-microlocal analysis result can be used to derive local behaviour of sample paths from the regularity of the integrand and the integrator .    through these theorems and examples [ ex :",
    "mg1 ] , [ ex : mbm_int ] and [ ex : besq ] , we show that local regularity of martingales and stochastic integrals can vary along sample paths and may not be deterministic .",
    "similar behaviours have already been exhibited in the literature , from the slow points of brownian motion ( @xcite,@xcite ) to more recent work on lvy ( @xcite ) , multifractional ( @xcite ) and markov processes ( @xcite,@xcite ) .    using the 2-microlocal frontier of stochastic integrals",
    ", we finally describe how to obtain regularity results for stochastic differential equations .",
    "in particular , if it is already known that hlder regularity of the coefficients have an impact on the existence and uniqueness of solutions ( e.g. @xcite in the case of spde ) , we establish for sde that it also subtly affects the local behaviour of the solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start by a preliminary section which recalls properties of the classic 2-microlocal frontier in section [ sec : cl_2ml ] .",
    "section [ sec : ps_2ml ] introduces another deterministic tool , the pseudo 2-microlocal frontier , closely related to the previous one .",
    "our main result on the 2-microlocal frontier of continuous martingales is proved in section [ sec:2ml_mg ] .",
    "results concerning stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations are respectively developed in sections [ sec:2ml_int ] and [ sec:2ml_sde ] .",
    "finally , some technical proofs of deterministic and intermediate results are gathered in [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the starting point of _ 2-microlocal analysis _ is the definition of specific functional spaces , called _ 2-microlocal spaces _ and denoted by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a given point . actually ,",

    "hence , in many situations , the study can even be restricted to spaces @xmath28 , where @xmath41 . in this case , as @xmath42 , the previous characterization simply becomes @xmath43    finally , the definition of 2-microlocal spaces when @xmath44}}$ ] is slightly more complex and is given at the end of this section since it is little - used in this article .",
    "the pointwise hlder exponent of a function @xmath6 is characterized as the supremum of the @xmath1 such that @xmath6 belongs to @xmath45 .",
    "likewise , the _ 2-microlocal frontier _ of @xmath6 at @xmath3 is defined as the map @xmath46 such that @xmath47 we note equation [ eq : def_2ml_spaces ] implies that @xmath48 when @xmath49 , and therefore shows the 2-microlocal frontier exists and is well - defined .    it has been proved ( see e.g. @xcite the 2-microlocal frontier @xmath46 satisfies several interesting properties :    *",

    "we note there exist other regularity exponents , like chirp , weak and oscillation exponents introduced in @xcite and @xcite that can be retrieved from the 2-microlocal frontier ( see @xcite for an exhaustive list ) .    as an example , we consider the chirp function @xmath60 introduced previously .",

    "allows to predict the evolution of regularity if a ( pseudo-)differential operator is applied to @xmath6 .",

    "finally , we note that in the case @xmath85 or @xmath86 , our characterization is slightly different from the classical one given in @xcite , but this does not affect results developed in this article since the 2-microlocal frontier is not sensitive to this singularity .",

    "stochastic differential equations ( sde ) are often used as a mathematical representation of natural phenomenons .",
    "local regularity constitutes an interesting indicator to verify how `` correctly '' a model fits observable data . in this section ,",
    "we present a method to obtain the 2-microlocal frontier ( or at least a lower bound for the local regularity ) of sde solutions .    to simplify our statement and the expressions , we focus on homogeneous diffusions which have the following form : @xmath491 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are continuous functions with respective pseudo pointwise hlder exponents @xmath492 and @xmath493 at @xmath68 .",
    "we assume the existence of a solution @xmath21 to this sde . from theorem [ th:2ml_stoch_int_bm ] , there exists an event @xmath208 such that @xmath494 and for all @xmath209 and @xmath108 , the pseudo 2-microlocal frontier of @xmath21 and thus the local regularity is completely characterized .",
    "similarly , we have to distinguish different cases , as illustrated in equations , , and obtained on the pseudo 2-microlocal frontier @xmath495 .    if @xmath496 , theorem [ th:2ml_stoch_int_bm ] directly implies @xmath497    if @xmath498 , but is not locally equal to zero , and @xmath499 , the stochastic integral @xmath500 satisfies @xmath501 furthermore , using theorem [ th : int_pseudo_frontier ] , as @xmath499 and @xmath502 is continuous , we have @xmath503 these two expressions lead to the following @xmath504 and , in particular @xmath505 we can easily check that @xmath506 .",
    "thus , we get the following inequality for the negative part of the pseudo frontier : @xmath507 using the previous inequalities , we obtain : @xmath508 and , in particular @xmath509 therefore , we have @xmath510 , which leads to the following estimation of the pseudo frontier of @xmath21 @xmath511 in particular , we note that when @xmath512 , we get @xmath513    if @xmath498 , but is not locally equal to zero , and @xmath514 , we similarly obtain the following inequality @xmath515 as @xmath516 and using the translation property of the pseudo frontier .",
    "this inequality leads to @xmath517 and in particular @xmath518 therefore , if @xmath519 or @xmath520 , we obtain : @xmath521 which leads to @xmath522 in the case @xmath523 and @xmath524 , the previous inequalities imply that @xmath525 and @xmath526 .    finally , if @xmath527 is locally equal to zero at @xmath151 , we locally obtain a classic differential equation @xmath528 . similarly to previous calculations , we get the following inequality : @xmath529    we notice in the previous results that a self - regulating aspect appears in the regularity of diffusions , since the 2-microlocal frontier at @xmath151 can depend on the value of @xmath530 and @xmath531 .",
    "the behaviour is also illustrated in the two following examples [ ex : besq ] and [ ex : heston ] .",
    "for sake of readability , we have only considered homogeneous diffusions .",
    "but , results could be easily extended to non - homogeneous diffusions @xmath532 in that case , lower bounds obtained would depend on the stochastic hlder exponents of @xmath17 and @xmath18 along the two directions , i.e. @xmath533 and @xmath534 .",
    "more generally , we can see that the previous methodology can be extended to any kind of stochastic differential equation to get , at least , a lower bound for the local regularity of its solution .    to end this section",
    ", we apply theses techniques to obtain the exact regularity in two different examples of sde . in the first one , we characterize the 2-microlocal frontier of the square of @xmath535-dimensional bessel processes , which generalizes the result on @xmath536 described in the preliminaries .",
    "[ ex : besq ] we know that for every @xmath537 and @xmath538 , there exists a unique strong continuous solution to the following equation ( see @xcite ) : @xmath539 which is called the square of @xmath535-dimensional bessel process started at @xmath77 ( @xmath540 ) .",
    "hence , for every @xmath541 and @xmath538 , there exists an event @xmath208 such that @xmath205 and for all @xmath209 and @xmath108 , the 2-microlocal frontier of the @xmath540 @xmath406 is determined in the two following cases .    1 .",
    "if @xmath542 , @xmath543 and in particular @xmath544 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath545 , the pseudo frontier satisfies the equation @xmath546 which has a unique solution , @xmath547 and in particular @xmath548 and @xmath549 .",
    "these equalities are simple consequences of previous results on diffusions . indeed , since @xmath550 when @xmath551 , equations and prove the equalities on the pseudo frontier .",
    "to obtain the classic 2-microlocal frontier , we can apply corollary [ cor : eq_cl_psd ] on the stochastic integral @xmath552 and note that according to definition [ eq : def_2ml_spaces ] , the frontier is not modified when a polynomial ( i.e. @xmath553 ) is added .    as proved in @xcite , if @xmath554 , the set @xmath555 is transient and therefore , almost surely for any @xmath108 , the 2-microlocal frontier is equal to @xmath556 on the contrary , if @xmath557 , we know that @xmath555 is recurrent , and the distinctions between @xmath558 and @xmath559 is necessary .",
    "[ ex : heston ] in the second example , we obtain the 2-microlocal frontier of the heston model .",
    "this model has been introduced in @xcite to describe the price of an asset which has a stochastic volatility and therefore , it consists of two correlated sde .",
    "the interesting point in this model is that the regularity of the asset @xmath560 depends on the value of the volatility @xmath561 , as proved below .    in the heston model , @xmath560 and @xmath561",
    "are solutions of the following system of equations : @xmath562 where @xmath563 and @xmath564 are deterministic positive parameters and @xmath565 is a brownian motion where @xmath566 and @xmath567 may be dependent .",
    "then , there exists an event @xmath208 such that @xmath205 and for all @xmath209 and @xmath108 , 2-microlocal frontiers of @xmath560 and @xmath561 at @xmath151 are given by    1 .   if @xmath568 , @xmath569 2 .   if @xmath570 , @xmath571    we obtain the 2-microlocal frontier of @xmath561 similarly to the previous example .",
    "then , if we consider @xmath560 , as @xmath560 is positive @xmath572 if and only if @xmath573 .",
    "therefore , in this case we obtain the equation @xmath574 which leads to the expected solution .    according to @xcite ,",
    "if the parameters satisfy the inequality @xmath575 , then the process @xmath561 is almost surely positive . therefore , similarly to square of bessel processes , the result is simplified in that case as @xmath576 almost surely never happens .",
    "these two examples show that it is possible to get an exact result , more precise than lower bounds obtained at the beginning of the section , when the expressions of functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are explicit and when we are able to characterize the regularity of compositions @xmath577 and @xmath578 .",
    "another point illustrated by these examples and previous results on diffusions is that the regularity of the solutions of these sde are almost everywhere equal to @xmath579 and change only at exceptional points ( e.g. zeros of besq@xmath580 ) . even if these equations were driven by martingales other than the brownian motion , according to theorems [ th : mg_vq ] and [ th:2ml_stoch_int ] , interesting regularities would still be exceptional .",
    "nevertheless , many natural phenomenons have a regularity different from @xmath581 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and thus can not be represented by these classic diffusions .",
    "therefore , an interesting next step would be to extend our work to stochastic differential equations driven by fractional ( and multifractional ) brownian motion ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in order to exhibit the possibilities it brings in term of regularity .",
    "appendices gather some deterministic and technical results which are used along the article .      propositions and theorems related to pseudo 2-microlocal spaces and frontier",
    "are proved in this appendix .",
    "the first result is an extension of a well - known property on local hlder exponents : values of the local exponent around a point @xmath3 have an influence on the pseudo 2-microlocal frontier of @xmath6 at @xmath3 .",
    "[ lemma : pseudo_2ml_4 ] let @xmath6 be a continuous function and @xmath3 be in @xmath136 . then ,",
    "the pseudo 2-microlocal frontier at @xmath3 satisfies : @xmath582 where @xmath583 is the pseudo local hlder exponent of @xmath6 at @xmath584 .",
    "let @xmath3 be in @xmath136 .",
    "there exists a sequence @xmath585 which converges to @xmath3 and such that @xmath586 according to the definition of the pseudo local hlder exponent , we know that for all @xmath123 , @xmath587 and @xmath221 , @xmath588 we use this equality to prove the upper bound on the pseudo 2-microlocal frontier .    let first note that when @xmath241 , for all @xmath589 , @xmath590 when @xmath591 is small enough . therefore , according to the first equation , for all @xmath221 , @xmath241 and @xmath592 @xmath593 which leads to @xmath594 proving the expected inequality as @xmath595 .",
    "let first note that in the particular case @xmath6 is locally constant at @xmath3 , we easily observe that both classic and pseudo 2-microlocal frontiers are equal to @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we suppose from now that @xmath6 is not locally constant .",
    "we proceed by contradiction : if there exist @xmath123 and @xmath32 such that @xmath600 , then , there exist @xmath34 and @xmath33 such that @xmath601 in particular , for each @xmath602 , there exists @xmath603 such that @xmath604 } } ; \\quad { \\lvertf(u ) - f(v)\\rvert } \\leq c_k { \\lvertu - v\\rvert}^{1+{\\varepsilon}},\\ ] ] proving that @xmath6 is differentiable with null derivatives on the interval @xmath605}}$ ] .",
    "as it is satisfies for every @xmath602 and @xmath6 is continuous at @xmath3 , it must be constant on the interval @xmath606}}$ ] , which is in contradiction with the assumption of @xmath6 not locally constant .",

    "based on this remark , we can adapt the previous reasoning to every @xmath637 , @xmath88 , therefore proving the equality for all @xmath32 .",
    "recall that @xmath143 is defined by @xmath144 if @xmath6 is locally equal to @xmath40 at @xmath3 , @xmath143 is clearly constant in some neighbourhood of @xmath3 , and therefore , both frontiers of @xmath6 and @xmath143 are equal to @xmath89 .",
    "then , let consider the case @xmath638 . without any loss of generality",
    ", we can suppose @xmath639 . since @xmath6 is continuous , there exist @xmath640 such that for all @xmath36 , @xmath641 @xmath143 locally behaves like the function @xmath642 , and thus has the following pseudo frontier @xmath643      we know that the classic 2-microlocal frontier of @xmath143 satisfies @xmath645 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath6 is continuous , @xmath646 and therefore , as @xmath647 , the exponent @xmath648 defined previously is simply equal to @xmath649 .",
