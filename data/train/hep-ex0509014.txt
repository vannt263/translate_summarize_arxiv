    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is allowed in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) and leptoquark models .",
    "lepton flavor violating decays with @xmath7 mesons occur in models with either heavy singlet dirac neutrinos  @xcite , @xmath8parity violation in susy  @xcite or dimension - six effective fermionic operators that induce @xmath9 mixing  @xcite .",
    "experiments at the @xmath10-factories allow searches for such decays with a very high sensitivity .",
    "the best upper limits of @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the 90% confidence level were obtained in the cleo experiment using 13.9 fb@xmath13 of data  @xcite .    in this paper , we report on a search for lfv @xmath0 decays @xmath1 ( @xmath2)with a data sample of 281 fb@xmath3 collected at the @xmath14 resonance and 60 mev below it with the belle detector at the kekb @xmath4 asymmetric - energy collider  @xcite .    the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) , all located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field . an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath15 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "particle identification is very important in this measurement .",
    "particle identification likelihood variables are based on the ratio of the energy deposited in the ecl to the momentum measured in the svd and cdc , the shower shape in the ecl , the particle range in the klm , the hit information from the acc , the measured @xmath16 in the cdc and the particle s time - of - flight from the tof . for lepton identification",
    ", we use a likelihood ratio based on the electron probability @xmath17  @xcite and muon probability @xmath18  @xcite determined by the responses of the appropriate subdetectors .    for monte carlo ( mc ) studies ,",
    "the following programs have been used to generate background events : koralb / tauola  @xcite for @xmath19 , qq  @xcite for @xmath20 and continuum , bhlumi  @xcite for bhabha events , kkmc  @xcite for @xmath21 and aafh  @xcite for two - photon processes .",
    "signal mc is generated by koralb / tauola .",
    "signal @xmath0 decays are two - body and assumed to have a uniform angular distribution in the @xmath0 lepton s rest frame .",
    "the belle detector response is simulated by a geant 3  @xcite based program .",
    "all kinematic variables are calculated in the laboratory frame unless stated otherwise .",
    "in particular , variables calculated in the @xmath4 center - of - mass ( cm ) frame are indicated by the superscript `` cm '' .",
    "we search for @xmath19 events in which one @xmath0 ( signal side ) decays into @xmath22 where @xmath23 is @xmath24 or @xmath25 and @xmath7 decays into @xmath26 , while the other @xmath0 ( tag side ) decays into one charged particle of opposite sign to the lepton with any number of additional photons and neutrinos .",
    "thus , the experimental signature is :    @xmath27 .",
    "all charged tracks and photons are required to be reconstructed within the fiducial volume defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the polar angle with respect to the direction opposite to the @xmath30 beam .",
    "charged tracks should have momentum transverse to the @xmath30 beam @xmath31 gev/@xmath32 and photons should have energies @xmath33 gev .",
    "signal events are isolated with following selections .",
    "we first demand that the four tracks have zero net charge .",
    "the magnitude of the thrust  @xcite is required to be larger than 0.9 to suppress the @xmath34 continuum background .",
    "the event must have a 3 - 1 prong configuration relative to the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis .",
    "the @xmath7 is reconstructed from two oppositely - charged pions that have an invariant mass within 0.482 gev/@xmath35 gev/@xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath26 vertex is required to be displaced from the interaction point ( ip ) in the direction of the pion pair momentum  @xcite . in order to avoid fake @xmath7 candidates from photon conversions ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , the invariant mass reconstructed by assigning the electron mass to the tracks ,",
    "is required to be greater than 0.2 gev/@xmath36 .",
    "we apply the lepton identification requirements to each track except for the two tracks that are part of the @xmath7 candidate on the signal side .",
    "the electron and muon identification criteria are @xmath38 with @xmath39 gev/@xmath32 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 gev/@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "after the event selection described above , most of the remaining background comes from @xmath19 and continuum events including a single @xmath7 meson .    to ensure that the missing particles are neutrinos rather than photons or charged particles that are outside the detector acceptance",
    ", we impose additional requirements on the missing momentum vector , @xmath42 , calculated by subtracting the vector sum of the momenta of all tracks and photons from the sum of the @xmath30 and @xmath43 beam momenta .",
    "we require that the magnitude of @xmath42 be greater than 0.4 gev / c and that it point into the fiducial volume of the detector : @xmath44 , as shown for the @xmath45 mode in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the total visible energy in the cm frame @xmath46 , is defined as the sum of the energies of the @xmath7 candidate , the lepton , the tag - side track ( with pion mass assumed ) and all photon candidates .",
    "we require it to satisfy @xmath47 gev @xmath48 gev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] ( c ) ) .",
    "since neutrinos are emitted only on the tag - side , the direction of @xmath42 should lie within the tag - side of the event .",
    "the cosine of the opening angle between @xmath42 and the tag - side track in the cm system , @xmath49 is therefore required to be greater than 0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cut ] ( d ) ) . to suppress the continuum background , the following requirements on the number of the photon candidates on the signal and tag side",
    "are imposed : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "finally , the correlation between the reconstructed momentum of the @xmath22 system , @xmath52 , and the cosine of the opening angle between the lepton and @xmath7 , @xmath53 is employed to exclude background from generic @xmath19 and continuum : @xmath54 , where @xmath52 is in gev/@xmath32 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pmiss_vs_mmiss2 ] ) . while this condition retains 99% of the signal events ,",
    "99% of the generic @xmath19 and 84% of the @xmath55 continuum background are removed .",
    "the signal detection efficiencies for the @xmath56 and @xmath45 modes are 15.0% and 16.2% after all criteria applied , respectively .",
    "signal candidates are examined in the two - dimensional space of the @xmath57 invariant mass , @xmath58 , and the difference of their energy from the beam energy in the cm system , @xmath59 .",
    "a signal event should have @xmath58 close to the @xmath0-lepton mass and @xmath59 close to 0 .",
    "for both modes , the @xmath58 and @xmath59 resolutions are parameterized from the mc distributions around the peak with bifurcated gaussian shapes to account for initial state radiation . these have widths @xmath60 mev/@xmath32@xmath61 and @xmath62 mev , for the @xmath56 mode and , @xmath63 mev/@xmath32@xmath61 and @xmath64 mev , respectively for the @xmath65 mode , where the `` high / low '' superscript indicates the higher / lower side of the peak .",
    "we blind a region of @xmath66 around the @xmath0 mass in @xmath67 and a region of @xmath68 gev so as not to bias our choice of selection criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows scatter - plots for data and signal mc samples distributed over @xmath69 in the @xmath70 plane .",
    "most of the surviving background events in both modes come from @xmath71 and @xmath72 decays .",
    "the remaining continuum backgrounds in the @xmath65 mode are combinations of a true @xmath7 meson and a fake lepton .",
    "to optimize the sensitivity for the search , we use an elliptically shaped signal region , which has major and minor axes that correspond to @xmath73 in the mc resolution for the @xmath74 plane .",
    "this region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "signal efficiencies for this region after all requirements are 11.8% for @xmath56 and 13.5% for @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "as there are few remaining mc background events in the signal ellipse , we estimate the background contribution using the @xmath75 sideband regions .",
    "this is achieved by extrapolating to the signal region under the assumption that the background distribution is flat in @xmath75 .",
    "we find the expected background in the ellipse to be @xmath76 events for each of the two modes .",
    "we open the blinded region and find no data events for the @xmath56 and @xmath65 modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) . since no statistically significant excess of data over the expected background in the signal region",
    "is observed , we apply a frequentist approach to calculate upper limits for the signal yields  @xcite .",
    "the resulting limits for the signal yields at 90% confidence level , @xmath77 , are 2.23 events in both modes .",
    "the upper limits on the branching fraction before the inclusion of systematic uncertainties are then calculated as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the resulting values are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    the dominant systematic uncertainties on the detection sensitivity : @xmath83 come from @xmath7 reconstruction and tracking efficiencies .",
    "these are 4.5% and 4.0% , respectively , for both modes .",
    "other sources of the systematic uncertainties are : the trigger efficiency ( 0.5% ) , lepton identification ( 2.0% ) , mc statistics ( 0.3% ) , and luminosity ( 1.4% ) . assuming no correlation between them , all these uncertainties are combined in quadrature to give a total of @xmath84 .",
    "upper limits on the branching fractions at the 90% c.l . including these systematic uncertainties are calculated with the pole program without conditioning  @xcite .",
    "the resulting upper limits on the branching fractions are @xmath85",
    "in conclusion , we have searched for the lepton flavor violation decays @xmath86 ( @xmath2 ) using data collected with the belle detector at the kekb @xmath4 asymmetric - energy collider .",
    "we found no signal in either mode .",
    "the following upper limits on the branching fractions were obtained : @xmath5 and @xmath87 at the 90% confidence level and including systematic uncertainties .",
