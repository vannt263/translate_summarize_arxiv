    "the paper focuses on the problem of finding a common solution of a system of equilibrium problems ( csep ) , i.e. , find @xmath0 such that @xmath1 where @xmath2 are bifunctions .",
    "the csep is very general in the sense that it includes , as special cases , many mathematical models as : convex feasibility problems , common fixed point problems , common solutions to variational inequality problems ( csvip ) , common minimizer problems , common saddle point problems , variational inequalities over the intersection of closed convex subsets , common solutions of operator equations , see @xcite and the references therein . in this paper , we introduce two hybrid algorithms for solving cseps , namely :    [ h2015a ] @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the intersection of @xmath5 specially constructed halfspaces ( see , algorithm [ algor1 ] in section [ main ] below ) and its modification    [ h2015b ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 are two specially constructed half - spaces ( see algorithm @xmath8 in section @xmath9 below ) .    when csep consists of a single equilibrium problem ( ep ) for a bifunction @xmath10 , i.e. , find @xmath0 such that @xmath11 then algorithms [ h2015a ] and [ h2015b ] become the following hybrid algorithm .",
    "[ h2015c ] @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the intersection of two half - spaces .",
    "one of the most popular methods for monotone eps is the proximal point method ( ppm ) @xcite in which solution approximations to eps are based on the resolvent @xmath14 @xcite of equilibrium bifunction @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , in 2010 , c. jaiboon and p. kumam @xcite proposed the following hybrid algorithm for an ep @xmath19 they proved that the sequence @xmath20 generated by @xmath21 converges strongly to the projection of @xmath22 onto the solution set @xmath23 of ep .",
    "note that when @xmath15 is monotone then @xmath14 is single - valued , strongly monotone and firmly nonexpansive ( so nonexpansive ) . in 2008 ,",
    "the extragradient method @xcite for variational inequalities was extended to eps in euclidean spaces by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the extended extragradient method consists of solving two programs @xmath24 after that it was further extended to hilbert spaces @xcite . in hilbert spaces ,",
    "the iterative process @xmath25 , in general , is weakly convergent . in 2013 , the authors in @xcite proposed the following hybrid algorithm for pseudomonotone eps ( see algorithm 2 and theorem 4.2 in @xcite with @xmath26 being the identity operator @xmath27 for all @xmath28 ) . @xmath29 and they proved the sequence @xmath20 generated by ( [ vsh2013a ] ) converges strongly to @xmath30 .",
    "we see that in the extended extragradient methods @xcite , two convex optimization programs must be solved at each iterative step .",
    "this seems to be costly if the feasible set @xmath31 has a complex structure and can affect seriously the efficiency of the used method . to avoid solving the second optimization program in the extended extragradient method and to reduce conditions posed on the equilibrium bifunction @xmath15 , in 2014 , the authors in @xcite replaced it by the armijo linesearch technique and a projection on @xmath31 , and introduced the following strongly convergence hybrid algorithm @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , in the iterative algorithm ( [ dhm2014 ] ) we still have to perform the linesearch process for finding the smallest integer number @xmath35 and a projection onto @xmath31 for finding @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that algorithm [ h2015c ] does not use the ppm and the resolvent of the equilibrium bifunction @xmath15 .",
    "contrary to the extended extragradient method and armijo linesearch method , in algorithm [ h2015c ] , only a convex optimization program is solved at each iterative step without the extra - steps .",
    "moreover , the sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 in algorithm [ h2015c ] ( also , in algorithm [ h2015b ] ) are two halfspaces .",
    "thus , the next iterate @xmath39 can be expressed by an explicit formula , for instance , in @xcite while the sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the iterative processes ( [ jk2010 ] ) , ( [ vsh2013a ] ) and ( [ dhm2014 ] ) deal with the feasible set @xmath31 , and so @xmath40 , in general , is not easy to find .",
    "some iterative algorithms for solving cseps can be found in @xcite and the references therein . in this paper , motivated by the results in @xcite for variational inequalities , we propose algorithms [ h2015a ] and [ h2015b ] for finding a common solution of equilibrium problems .",
    "we are emphasized that algorithm [ h2015a ] seems to be difficult to develop numerical methods because in order to find the next iterate @xmath40 we must solve a distance optimization program on the intersection of @xmath5 halfspaces .",
    "it is not easy to implement when the number of subproblems @xmath41 is large .",
    "however , whether it can help in the design and analysis of more practical algorithms remains to be seen . to overcome this complexity",
    ", we use a technical extension in @xcite and introduce algorithm [ h2015b ] as a modification of algorithm @xmath42 . in this algorithm ,",
    "as mentioned above , the next approximation @xmath40 is defined as the projection on the intersection of two halfspaces and it is easily found by an explicit formula in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we recall some definitions and preliminary results used in the paper .",
    "we begin with several concepts of the monotonicity of a bifunction and a operator ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a bifunction @xmath10 is said to be    * strongly monotone on @xmath31 if there exists a constant @xmath43 such that @xmath44 * monotone on @xmath31 if @xmath45 * pseudomonotone on @xmath31 if @xmath46 * lipschitz - type continuous on @xmath31 if there exist two positive constants @xmath47 such that @xmath48    from the definitions above , it is clear that @xmath49    an operator @xmath50 is said to be    * monotone on @xmath31 if @xmath51 , for all @xmath52 ; * pseudomonotone on @xmath31 if @xmath53 for all @xmath52 ; * @xmath54 - lipschitz continuous on @xmath31 if there exists a positive constant @xmath54 such that @xmath55 for all @xmath52 .    for solving csep @xmath56 and ep @xmath57 , we assume that the bifunction @xmath10 satisfies the following conditions :    * @xmath15 is pseudomonotone on @xmath31 and @xmath58 for all @xmath59 ; * @xmath15 is lipschitz - type continuous on @xmath31 ; * @xmath15 is weakly continuous on @xmath31 ; * @xmath60 is convex and subdifferentiable on @xmath31 for each @xmath59 .",
    "it is easy to show that under the assumptions @xmath61 then the solution set @xmath23 of ep ( [ ep ] ) is closed and convex ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the solution set @xmath62 of csep ( [ csep ] ) is also closed and convex . in this paper",
    "we assume that the solution set @xmath63 is nonempty .",
    "the metric projection @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 since @xmath31 is nonempty , closed and convex , @xmath66 exists and is unique .",

    "<S> in this paper , we introduce some new hybrid algorithms for finding a solution of a system of equilibrium problems . in these algorithms , by constructing specially cutting - halfspaces , we avoid using the extra - steps as in the extragradient method and the armijo linesearch method which are inherently costly when the feasible set has a complex structure . the strong convergence of the algorithms is established .    </S>",
