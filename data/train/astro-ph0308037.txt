    "in the simplest structure formation model , the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium ( icm ) are simply governed by shock heating in gravitational infall .",

    "ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1999 ) and lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon ( 2000 ) found that the central entropy of galaxy groups is higher than predicted by self - similar scaling .",
    "these deviations from the self - similar model imply departures from scale - free relations in actual icm evolution .",
    "the general consensus is that some non - gravitational processes must be included in icm evolution .",
    "three ideas are currently discussed in the literature : pre - heating ( or star - formation feedback ) , radiative cooling , and galaxy formation efficiency . for detailed descriptions of the current understanding of these processes in galaxy clusters and groups , see tozzi & norman ( 2001 , tn01 hereafter ) , babul et al .",

    "we can test numerical models of the growth of dark matter halos ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; moore et al .",

    "this , in combination with the limited range of the measured mass profile , makes it impossible to derive a global dark matter model for the ngc  1550 group .",
    "nevertheless , we fit the total mass profile within 200  kpc to obtain an estimate of the concentration parameter . for an nfw profile ,",
    "we obtain best - fit parameters of @xmath78 and @xmath79  kpc ( @xmath31 = 38.7/25 ) .",

    "the corresponding concentration is @xmath1 6.2 , which implies a halo mass of @xmath1 10@xmath82 m@xmath63",
    ". it would be most interesting to compare the theoretical models to more accurate mass profile extending over a larger range of radii to critically test their similarities and differences in low mass systems .",

    "the moore profile fit predicts @xmath83 = 208 - 237 kpc and @xmath85 = 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath86 m@xmath63 , which is smaller than the value expected from the @xmath75 relations of hot clusters .",
    "ngc  1550 exhibits a unique temperature profile and shows similarities to other cool groups with accurate measured profiles . in fig .  10",

    ". similar temperature profile of ngc 4761 ( or hcg 62 ) was also found by mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998 ) and buote ( 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , nine galaxy groups observed with asca also generally show temperature declines at large radii ( from 0.1 - 0.2 ) ( see finoguenov et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , all these temperature profiles have large uncertainties and insufficient angular resolution to directly compare with the precisely measured  and  profiles shown in fig",
    ".  10 .    in summary ,",
    "the current knowledge of 1  kev galaxy groups suggests that at least some of them have a rather common temperature profile with temperatures declining beyond @xmath87 , and the temperature at 0.2 is @xmath88% of the temperature at 0.05 .",
    "however , there also seem to exist a class of 1  kev galaxy groups with very flat temperature profiles including ngc  2300 ( davis et al . 1996 ) and ngc  4325 ( m03 ) .",
    "this may reflect different roles of non - gravitational processes ( including cd heating ) or different formation histories in different groups .",
    "more high - quality temperature profiles from and  are needed to fully understand the origin of temperature structure of cool groups .",
    "hot galaxy clusters show some of the same temperature profile characteristics as seen for ngc  1550 , but with an important difference . based on the analysis of  data , markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ; m98 hereafter ) argued that hot clusters exhibit a universal temperature profile , with the temperature at 0.5 declining to only @xmath89% of the temperature at 0.1 . de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ; dm02 hereafter ) using  data found good agreement with m98 beyond 0.2 and a flat profile from the cooling radius to 0.2 . despite the agreement between dm02 and m98 ,",
    "the behavior of cluster temperature profiles beyond 0.2 remains controversial with cluster showing flat profiles to 0.4 - 0.7 ( e.g. , a2390 , a1795 , a1835 and a2163 ) ( allen , ettori & fabian 2001 ; arnaud et al . 2001 ; pratt , arnaud & aghanim 2001 ; majerowicz , neumann & reiprich 2002 ) .",
    "however , some clusters do show temperature declines at large radii ( e.g. , a1413 , pratt & arnaud 2002 ) .",
    "in summary , recent observations support flat temperature profiles of hot clusters beyond the cooling radius to at least 0.2 , while the behaviour beyond 0.2 is not definitively determined .    despite the uncertainty in cluster temperature profiles are large radii , their behavior at moderate radii contrasts strongly with that of the 1  kev galaxy groups shown in fig .",
    "10 , in which significant temperature declines are found between 0.1 and 0.2 . to quantitatively compare clusters and groups",
    ", we fit the temperature profiles of 1  kev groups at large radii ( beyond 0.07 ) with a polytropic model ( @xmath90@xmath91 ) to measure the slope of the temperature decline . combining all four profiles from fig .  10",
    ", the best - fit is @xmath92 ( @xmath31 = 29.7/11 ) .",
    "if we omit the rather flat temperature profile of ngc 4325 , the results change little : @xmath93 ( @xmath31 = 18.1/8 ) .",
    "while the polytropic index we find for groups is remarkably similar to that found by dm02 for cooling - flow clusters , the temperature declines in groups occur at much smaller radii ",
    "0.07 -0.25 for groups compared to 0.2 - 0.6 as found by dm02 for hot clusters .",
    "if we approximate the gas density profile in this range as @xmath94 @xmath95 with @xmath96 or 2 , expected if the gas density profiles follow a @xmath26-model with @xmath97 or 2/3 and the pressure is given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , then we find @xmath100 = 1.26 - 1.19 ( with an uncertainty of 0.02 .",
    "thus , @xmath100 lies between the isothermal index of 1 and the adiabatic index of 5/3 , in agreement with the value found by m98 , @xmath100 = 1.24@xmath101 for hot clusters , but , again , at larger radii .",
    "the observed difference in the radius at which groups and clusters show the radial temperature decline can be alleviated if the virial radius of cool groups is smaller than that derived from the empirical relation of emn96 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : rvir ] ) .",
    "the birmingham - cfa cluster scaling project reveals that the measured virial radii of clusters and groups are smaller than those expected from self - similar scaling relations , especially for cool groups ( sanderson et al .",
    "2003 ) . for groups like ngc  1550",
    ", their result shows that the true virial radius may be as small as 60% of the value derived using the empirical relation by emn96 .",
    "in fact , if we applies the best - fit moore profile in @xmath144.3 , the derived virial radius of the ngc  1550 group is @xmath1 650 kpc  @xmath1 65% of the value derived using the simple scale relation .",
    "nevertheless , this can not completely explain the observed difference .",
    "the temperature profiles of these @xmath1 1 kev groups at radii larger than 0.05 can be compared to simulations .",
    "most simulations are for hot clusters , while the ones dedicated to cool groups are rather scarce . the observed 1 kev group temperature profiles ( see fig .",
    "10 ) agree with the `` universal temperature profile '' of galaxy clusters from adiabatic simulations ( loken et al .",

    "entropy floor '' simulations ( tn01 ; borgani et al .",
    "2002 ; babul et al .",

    "muanwong et al .",
    "( 2002 ) produced adiabatic , radiative and pre - heating simulations of galaxy groups .",
    "their predicted temperature profiles are too flat between 0.06 and 0.2 , inconsistent with the majority of observations .",
    "dav@xmath11 et al . ( 2002 ) include cooling and star formation , but no substantial non - gravitational heating in their simulations of galaxy groups .",
    "the resulting temperature profile is consistent with the observations .",
    "temperature and entropy profiles to @xmath1 0.5 will be able to put tighter constraint on simulations in the future .",
    "the inner ( 0.05 ) temperature profiles of 1 kev groups ( fig .",
    "10 ) are also similar .",
    "none of simulations describe the temperature profiles in this region well .",
    "this may require high resolution simulations that carefully handle the radiative cooling and a better understanding of the cooling flow physics .",
    "since the temperature peak or plateau of these 1 kev groups lies at relatively small radii ( within 30 - 110 kpc ) , feedback from the cd galaxy should not be ignored .",
    "the high temperature plateau at 30 - 110 kpc in the ngc  1550 group may be caused by heating from the central galaxy .",
    "if we assume an energy input of 0.2 kev / particle from ngc 1550 , over the lifetime of the group an energy input of at least 10@xmath102 ergs is needed .",
    "this is @xmath1 2 orders of magnitude higher than the current radio output of ngc  1550 integrated over 10 gyr .",
    "however , ngc  1550 may have episodic activity related to the cooling flow ( sun et al . 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "galactic winds also can heat the icm / igm significantly . based on the simulations by david , forman & jones ( 1991 ) ,",
    "the galactic wind of ngc  1550 can provide up to an order of magnitude more energy than required .",
    "thus , ngc  1550 may play an important role in shaping the inner temperature profile either during its radio active periods or by its galactic wind .",
    "thus , the temperature `` bump '' seen in other groups also can be produced by the heating of the cd galaxies .",
    "one scenario to explain the entropy excess in the center of galaxy groups is that low - entropy gas in the central region cools , condenses into dense and cold objects , and the high - entropy gas flows in to fill the volume .",
    "voit & bryan ( 2001 ) argued that only gas with entropy larger than 100 - 150 kev cm@xmath10 has a long enough cooling time to survive in cluster / group cores .",
    "however , we do not observe a flat entropy profile in the center of ngc  1550 , which questions the validity of simulations that invoke an entropy - floor , e.g. , tn01 , babul et al .",
    "this is consistent with the recent systematic study by ponman , sanderson & finoguenov ( 2003 ) .",
    "the temperature decline from @xmath1 0.08 makes the entropy profile flatten at large radii , @xmath104 between 20 kpc and 80 kpc , while @xmath105 between 80 kpc and 200 kpc ( fig .",

    "the scaled entropy profiles of these 1 kev groups flatten between @xmath1 0.1 and 0.2 , but with different values spanning almost a factor of three .",
    "all these imply that the entropy profiles of 1 kev groups show larger scattering than those of hotter groups , which reinforces the idea that there is no fixed entropy floor for 1 kev groups .",
    "this reflects larger roles of non - gravitational processes in 1 kev groups than hotter systems and implies varied pre - heating levels .",
    "despite the known large scatter in the l@xmath7 - t relation , ngc  1550 is very x - ray luminous for its x - ray gas temperature .",

    "<S> for its temperature ( 1.37@xmath00.01 kev ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 300 km s@xmath2 ) , the ngc  1550 group is one of the most luminous known galaxy groups ( l@xmath3 = 1.65@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath2 within 200 kpc , or 0.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that within @xmath6 kpc , where the gas cooling time is less than a hubble time , the gas temperature decreases continuously toward the center , implying the existence of a cooling core . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature also declines beyond @xmath1 100 kpc ( or 0.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a remarkable similarity of the temperature profile of ngc  1550 with those of two other 1 kev groups with accurate temperature determination . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature begins to decline at 0.07 - 0.1 , while in hot clusters the decline begins at or beyond 0.2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there are at least some 1 kev groups that have significantly different temperature profiles from those of hot clusters , which may reflect the role of non - gravitational processes in icm / igm evolution . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  1550 has no isentropic core in its entropy profile , in contrast to the predictions of ` entropy - floor ' simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the scaled entropy profiles of three 1 kev groups ( including ngc  1550 ) and three 2 - 3 kev groups . </S>",
    "<S> the scaled entropy profiles of 1 kev groups show much larger scatter than those of hotter systems , which implies varied pre - heating levels . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the mass content of the ngc  1550 group and the abundance profile of heavy elements . </S>"
