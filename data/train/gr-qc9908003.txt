    "one important property of field theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking is that the life - time of energetically meta - stable vacuum states can be very long .",
    "this can lead to the partitioning of the universe into regions of different meta - stable vacuum states .",
    "one of these structures is called cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "such kind of structures represent thin tubes of false vacuum and are expected to be of large linear mass density @xmath5 and can also carry intrinsic angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the cosmic strings affect the spacetime mainly topologically , giving a conical structure to the space region around the cone of the string",
    ". the conical topology may be responsible for several gravitational effects , gravitational lensing @xcite and particle production due to the changing gravitational field during the formation of such object @xcite being some examples .",
    "there is a lot of papers studying quantum processes in a cosmic string spacetime .",
    "of special interest to us are the following : @xcite where pair production in a straight cosmic string spacetime is discussed , @xcite where the response function of detectors in the presence of the cosmic strings is calculated , and @xcite where the spinning cosmic string spacetime is investigated . finally spinning cosmic strings",
    "were studied also by galtsov _",
    "et al . _ and also letelier .",
    "these authors investigated chiral strings generating a chiral conical spacetime @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in two calculations .",
    "first , to analyse the energy momentum distribution of a time dependente spinning cosmic string spacetime .",
    "second , to estimate the particle production due to the changing gravitational field in the situation of gradual loss of angular momentum .",
    "the einsteins gravity equation of general relativity is given by : @xmath7 where the constant @xmath8 is defined to give the correct newtonian limit , resulting in @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 appearing in the latter equation represent the newtonian gravitational constant and light velocity , respectively .    in order to obtain the geometry generated by a rotating cosmic string we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , we choose a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath12 ) in which an infinitely long and thin cosmic string lies along the @xmath13-axis .",
    "we consider a stationary string carrying linear densities of mass @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the mass density is proportional to a two - dimensional delta function ( @xmath15-function ) while the angular momentum density is proportional to the derivatives of @xmath15-functions .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 components of the associated energy momentum tensor will be proportional to @xmath15-function and its derivatives , respectively .",
    "thus , einstein equations leads to the geometry @xmath18 =   \\left (        \\begin{array}{cccc }        c^2 &   0 & 4g{\\cal j}_{\\scriptscriptstyle 0}/c^2   & 0 \\\\        0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\        4g{\\cal j}_{\\scriptscriptstyle 0}/c^2 & 0   &   -\\left(b^2r^2 - 16g^2{\\cal j}_{\\scriptscriptstyle 0}^2/c^6\\right ) & 0 \\\\        0 &            0            &            0         & -1       \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{3}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 from these metric components we can construct the associated line element @xmath20 therefore , as was noticed by deser and jackiw @xcite , the two - parameter @xmath21 metric tensor showed in equation ( [ 3 ] ) represents the general time - independent solution to gravitational einstein equations outside any matter distribution lying in a bounded region on the plane and having cylindrical symmetry . in this work",
    "we will consider only the exterior region of the cosmic string .",
    "thus the @xmath15-functions will be suppressed in our analysis of the energy momentum tensor generating a spacetime configuration due to a cosmic string loosing angular momentum .    in the same way the exact spacetime metric representing the vacuum solution of a static cylindrically symmetric cosmic string is found @xcite to be @xmath22",
    "obviously this metric is a particular case of the former , equation ( [ 5 ] ) , with null density of angular momentum .",
    "thus it arises the questions : how can we go from a spinning cosmic string spacetime to a static one and what is the rate of particle production between these two asymptotic limits ?",
    "first of all , let us assume that the cosmic string is generated in such way that there is spontaneous loss of energy associated with change in its rotation velocity , i.e. , loss of density of angular momentum .",
    "quantitatively such process would correspond to a non - stationary spacetime geometry that could be described by the metric ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath14 replaced by a general function of time @xmath23 : @xmath24^{2 } - dr^{2 } - b^{2}r^{2}d\\varphi^{2}-dz^{2 } \\label{7}\\ ] ] and provided with the asymptotic conditions @xmath25 a specific choice for the density of angular momentum that solves the above relations is given by @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{10}\\ ] ]    in the following section we will look for the kind of matter content that generates such spacetime geometry .",
    "as we can notice , the region between the two asymptotic limits represents a curved spacetime . from einstein equations",
    "we show that the fluid configuration characterizing such geometry is represented by the following energy momentum tensor components @xmath27 =   -\\frac{2g{\\cal j}_{\\scriptscriptstyle 0}}{\\kappa r \\cosh t}\\left (        \\begin{array}{cccc }        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\        0 & \\frac{2gj_{\\scriptscriptstyle 0}}{b^2 r}f(t ) & 1 & 0 \\\\        0 & 1 &   0   & 0 \\\\        0 & 0 &   0   & \\frac{2gj_{\\scriptscriptstyle 0}}{b^2 r}f(t )       \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{energia}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 defined by : @xmath29 let us now analyze the properties of the above characterized fluid .",
    "first of all we define a 4-velocity vector field @xmath30 @xmath31 and the projector tensor @xmath32 @xmath33 in the standard way , we express the energy momentum tensor in terms of its irreducible parts as @xmath34 where we introduced the quantities related with the fluid , i.e. , energy density , isotropic pressure , heat flux and anisotropic pressure , defined respectively as @xmath35 for the case we are analyzing here only isotropic and anisotropic pressure survive , and they result in : @xmath36 and @xmath37 =   -\\frac{p(t , r)}{2 } \\left (        \\begin{array}{cccc }        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\        0 & 1 & \\tilde{\\pi } & 0 \\\\        0 & \\tilde{\\pi } & -2 & 0 \\\\        0 & 0 & 0 & 1       \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{energia}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 from what we have seen , outside the core of the string there is not energy density of matter but only flux of energy , that appears as pressure . from the einstein equations we obtain the relation between the trace of the energy momentum tensor and the curvature of the spacetime ( @xmath39 ) , that results in : @xmath40    = 80ex = 80ex    the geometry of the spacetime is flat in the asymptotic regions corresponding to infinite past and infinite future .",
    "therefore it is worth to analyze the behavior of the curvature in the intermediate region . in the figure [ figure ] we plot the curvature @xmath41 as function of time @xmath42 and radial",
    "coordinate @xmath43 ( distance from the @xmath13 axes of the string ) . for @xmath44",
    "the spacetime is approximately flat for all values of @xmath43 , and for large values of @xmath43 it will still be flat for all values of @xmath42 , as we would expect . as time @xmath42 goes from negative to positive values",
    "the curvature decreases until it reaches a minimum value at @xmath45 . after this point",
    "it begins to increase , becomes positive and reaches a maximum value at @xmath46 .",
    "finally it asymptotically goes to zero .",
    "the two asymptotic spacetimes are flat .",
    "the only difference between them is that for @xmath0 the string is spinning with constant density of angular momentum @xmath47 .    as a general result of this analysis we obtained that the loss of angular momentum by a cosmic string causes a change in the metric properties of the spacetime . but",
    "changes in the gravitational field generate particles @xcite .",
    "thus we have to investigate the creation of particles and radiation by the changing gravitational field during the loss of angular momentum of a initially spinning cosmic string .",
    "we will treat this problem by performing the calculation of the bogoliubov transformation entailed by this process .",
    "from the general geometry ( [ 7 ] ) and the conditions ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , in the two asymptotic regions  the infinite past and infinite future  the spacetime metric structures reduce to : @xmath48 the above metrics represent the structure of the spacetime in the exterior region of a rotating and a non - rotating cosmic string , respectively .    in this section we will analyze the rate of particle production by the changing gravitational field between the two asymptotic spacetimes during the evolution of a cosmic string that looses angular momentum .",
    "a similar idea was used by bernard and duncan @xcite to study a two dimensional robertson - walker model where the conformal scale factor has the same functional form as equation ( [ 10 ] ) . in the two asymptotic limits ,",
    "the spacetime becomes minkowskian , and they obtained the mode solutions of the klein - gordon equation in these two limits . a straightforward calculation of the bogoliubov coefficients between the _ in _ and _ out _ modes gives the rate of particle production during the expansion of the universe .",
    "it is worth to notice that such method was first introduced by l. parker @xcite in order to calculate particle creation by the expansion of the universe .",
    "let us consider a massive minimally coupled hermitian scalar field @xmath49 defined at all points of the spacetime ( [ 7 ] ) .",

    ", we impose an additional vanishing boundary condition at @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the radial coordinate has the domain @xmath58 . for a careful study on how to construct quantum field theory in a spacetime with ctc , see for instance @xcite .",

    "the metric evolves continuously between both asymptotic states .",

    "mendell and hiscock extended parker s work considering a number of different models still using the sudden approximation .",
    "consequently if @xmath106 is the actual time of formation of the string , the production of particles in modes with frequencies that are large compared with @xmath107 are suppressed . in our model",
    ", the process of particle production by loss of angular momentum takes an infinite time , since we have two asymptotically flat spacetimes with curved geometry between both states .",
    "nevertheless some conclusions can be obtained . note that the part of the above expression that comes between braces does not depend on the energy of the produced particle @xmath108 . from this",
    "it is clear that the number of produced particles diverges for low and high energy modes .",
    "this behavior is expected for the low energy modes , but is not for the high ones .",
    "a way to improve our model is to assume a finite time @xmath109 for the loss of the angular momentum to occur , thereby introducing a natural cutoff in the energy of the produced particles , because now the production of modes for which the energy is large compared with @xmath110 will be also suppressed , as in the case of the sudden approximation .",
    "in this paper we discussed the properties of a fluid generating a general spinning cosmic string spacetime with flat limiting cases corresponding to a constant angular momentum in the infinite past and static configuration in the infinite future .",
    "we also analyze the particle production by loss of angular momentum in a spinning cosmic string spacetime . to circumvent the problem of ctcs we assumed a cosmic string with a radius fixed .",
    "moreover , to keep energy and number of particles produced by the process in a finite region of space , following parker s arguments , we impose vanishing boundary conditions on the wall of a cylinder with finite radius @xmath41 .",
    "a possible continuation of this paper is to formulate the energy conservation law , that is , to show if there is a balance between the total energy of the particles created and the energy associated with loss of angular momentum .",
    "this can be done comparing the vacuum stress - tensor of the massive field in the spinning and non - spinning cosmic string spacetimes .",
