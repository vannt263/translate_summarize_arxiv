    "in december 2015 , the both atlas and cms groups have reported the existence of the excess at around 750 gev in the diphoton distribution at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) with the collision energy of 13 tev .",
    "the local significance of this excess is about 3.6@xmath0 at atlas  @xcite with the integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb@xmath1 and about 2.6@xmath0 at cms  @xcite with the integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb@xmath1 .",
    "the detailed properties of the diphoton excess was summarized , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the best fit value of the width of the new resonance is about 45 gev , and the estimated cross section of the diphoton signature is @xmath2 fb at atlas and @xmath3 fb at cms .",
    "if this excess is confirmed by future data , it suggests the existence of a new particle which gives the direct evidence of a new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .    the simplest way to explain",
    "this excess is to consider an extension of the sm by adding extra isospin scalar multiplets such as a singlet , a doublet and/or a triplet .",
    "however , it is difficult to get a sufficient cross section to explain the excess as mentioned in the above in such a simple extension of the sm .",
    "for example , if we consider the cp - conserving two higgs doublet models ( thdms )  @xcite , and take the masses of the additional cp - even @xmath4 and cp - odd @xmath5 higgs bosons to be 750 gev , then the cross section of @xmath6 is typically three order smaller than the required value  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to further introduce additional sources to get an enhancement of the production cross section and/or the branching fraction to the diphoton mode , e.g. , by introducing multi - charged scalar particles  @xcite and vector - like fermions  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the diphoton excess has been discussed in supersymmetric models .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a scenario to _ naturally _ introduce multi - charged particles to get an enhancement of the branching fraction .",
    "namely , we consider a radiative neutrino mass model in which multi - charged particles play a role not only to increase the branching fraction but also to explain the smallness of neutrino masses and the anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment . a dark matter",
    "( dm ) candidate can also successfully be involved as a part of the model .",
    "there are a few papers discussing the diphoton excess within radiative neutrino mass models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we discuss a new three loop neutrino mass model whose structure is similar to the model by krauss , nasri and trodden in 2003  @xcite , because the three loop suppression factor @xmath7 is a suitable amount to reproduce the measured neutrino masses , i.e. , @xmath8 ev , by order 0.1 - 1 couplings and tev scale masses of new particles . in our model ,",
    "an additional isospin real singlet scalar field can explain the diphoton excess , where it is produced from the gluon fusion process through the mixing with the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define our model , and give the lagrangian for the lepton sector and the scalar potential . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the neutrino masses , the phenomenology of dm including the relic abundance and direct search experiments , and new contributions to the muon @xmath9 . the diphoton excess is discussed in sec .",

    "our model is described by the sm gauge symmetry @xmath10 and an additional discrete symmetry @xmath11 which is assumed to be unbroken .",
    "this @xmath11 symmetry is introduced to avoid tree level contributions to neutrino masses and to enclose the three - loop diagram as shown in fig .",
    "because of the @xmath11 symmetry , the stability of the lightest neutral @xmath11 odd particle is guaranteed , and thus it can be a candidate of dm .",
    "the particle contents are shown in table  [ tab:1 ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the sm left - handed lepton doublets and lepton singlets with the flavor of @xmath14 ( @xmath151 - 3 ) .",
    "in addition , we add the @xmath16 flavor of the vector like lepton doublets ( singlets ) @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with the hypercharge @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and the right - handed neutrinos @xmath21 ( @xmath22-@xmath16 ) .",
    "the scalar sector is composed of one isospin doublet field @xmath23 with @xmath24 and two complex ( one real ) isospin singlet scalar fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) .",
    "the doublet and the real singlet scalar fields are parameterized by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of doublet and singlet scalar fields , respectively , and @xmath33 @xmath34 denotes the nambu - goldstone boson which is absorbed into the longitudinal component of the @xmath35 @xmath36 boson .",
