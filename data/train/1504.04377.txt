    "the r - process , or rapid neutron - capture process , of stellar nucleosynthesis is invoked to explain the production of the stable ( and some long - lived radioactive ) neutron - rich nuclides heavier than iron that are observed in stars of various metallicities , as well as in the solar system ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "despite important effort to model potential r - process sites , all the proposed scenarios face serious problems and the site(s ) of the r - process is ( are ) not identified yet . until now",
    ", type - ii supernovae or @xmath5-ray bursts models have failed to provide convincing evidence for a successful r - processing that could significantly contribute to the galactic enrichment in r - material @xcite",
    ". only magneto - rotational supernova explosions with extremely strong pre - collapse magnetic fields and fast rotation seem to provide favourable conditions for r - processing , but such rare events are not expected to be at the origin of the global galactic enrichment in r - process nuclei @xcite .    for this reason , special attention is now being paid to neutron star ( ns ) mergers following the confirmation by hydrodynamic simulations that a significant amount of r - process enriched material , typically about @xmath6 to a few @xmath7@xmath8 , can be ejected @xcite .",
    "recent nucleosynthesis calculations by @xcite show that the combined contribution of both the dynamical ( prompt ) ejecta expelled during binary ns or ns - black hole ( bh ) mergers and the neutrino and viscously driven outflows generated during the post - merger remnant evolution of relic bh - torus systems can lead to the production of r - process elements from mass number @xmath9 up to thorium and uranium .",
    "the corresponding abundance distribution reproduces the solar distribution extremely well and can also account for the elemental distributions observed in low - metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent studies @xcite have reconsidered the galactic or cosmic chemical evolution of r - process elements in different evolutionary contexts .",
    "although they do not converge towards one unique quantitative picture , most of them arrived at the conclusion that double compact star mergers may be the major production sites of r - process elements .    despite the recent success of nucleosynthesis studies for ns mergers , the possibility of r - processing in these events is still affected by a variety of uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the impact of neutrino interactions is not yet studied and understood in detail , the main reason of which is the not yet manageable computational complexity associated with neutrino transport in a generically three - dimensional ( 3d ) , highly asymmetric environment with nearly relativistic fluid velocities and rapid changes in time .",
    "a computationally simple and much more efficient alternative to solving the time - dependent transport equation for neutrino distributions in the six - dimensional phase space is the use of a neutrino leakage scheme , in which the local neutrino net - emission ( i.e. , emission minus absorption ) rate is estimated by a weighted interpolation between the pure emission rate and an optical - depth dependent diffusive loss term ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , neutrino absorption can not be straightforwardly included in a self - consistent manner in a leakage scheme because information about the local neutrino densities is missing in such a treatment .",
    "it was long believed that neutrino interactions could not , at least not drastically , affect the initial neutron richness of the ejecta .",
    "such expectations were based on numerical merger models .",
    "the temperatures of the merging nss in these simulations , and therefore the neutrino production rates , remain low until the nss collide with each other , and they rise in an increasing volume only gradually on a time scale of several milliseconds after the first contact of the two nss @xcite . at this time a significant fraction of the ejecta material is already being expelled with nearly relativistic velocities .",
    "newtonian merger studies suggested that a large part of the ejecta material even from symmetric mergers ( i.e. , for two equal - mass or close to equal - mass nss ) is thrown out by tidal forces in extended spiral arms forming from matter of the outer faces of the merging objects during their final approach and collision @xcite . by the tidal",
    "stretching these arms naturally remain unshocked and thus stay cool .",
    "therefore they reach low densities so quickly that electron and positron captures can not become efficient . moreover",
    ", the ejecta escape to large radii before the neutrino emission of the compact merger remnant becomes sizable and neutrino absorption can affect the electron fraction significantly .",
    "absorption of neutrinos radiated by the massive merger remnant is also diminished because the tidal ejection in newtonian models happens preferentially in the orbital plane ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the neutrinos are predominantly emitted perpendicular to this plane @xcite .",
    "however , the described situation applies well only for newtonian mergers .",
    "the situation is different in the relativistic case .",
    "relativistic simulations of symmetric mergers do not show the development of prominent tidal arms , and the ejection of unshocked matter is therefore not important .",
    "instead , the collision shock that builds up at the interface of the two nss is typically stronger than in newtonian conditions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , leading to potentially higher temperatures and higher , faster rising neutrino luminosities @xcite .",
    "the ejecta are expelled fairly spherically instead of equatorially @xcite and consist of two main components , namely a first one in which very hot material is squeezed out from the collision interface of the two merging bodies , and a second , slightly delayed one that is expelled in waves from a torus - like belt of matter around the high - density core of the merger remnant .",
    "this torus is heated by spiral shocks that are sent out from the aspherical , wobbling , and rotating high - density core and that also lead to outward acceleration of parts of the torus matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent relativistic ns - ns merger simulations that took into account neutrino emission by means of a leakage scheme and absorption by an additional approximate transport treatment based on a moment formalism @xcite , found that neutrino interactions with free nucleons can significantly increase the electron fraction in the dynamical ejecta for cases in which the collapse of the merger remnant to a black hole is delayed or does not happen .",
    "under such conditions nuclei with mass numbers @xmath10 can also be created in the dynamical ejecta in addition to the heavy r - process elements ( @xmath11 ) . weak interaction processes of free nucleons can consequently affect the strength of the r - process and the emerging abundance distribution .    the accurate inclusion of neutrino interactions in hydrodynamical simulations remains a highly complex task .",
    "this motivated us to conduct a simple , parametric study in order to quantify the potential impact of weak interactions on the electron - fraction evolution in merger ejecta and thus to explore the consequences of charged - current neutrino - nucleon reactions for the nucleosynthesis and possible r - processing in these ejecta .",
    "more specifically , we investigate the influence of @xmath0-interactions of electron neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) and electron antineutrinos ( @xmath12 ) with free @xmath13 and @xmath14 and of their inverse reactions , @xmath15 on the @xmath1 distribution and r - process nucleosynthesis at conditions representative of the dynamical ejecta expelled by hydrodynamical forces during ns - ns mergers .",
    "these reactions have been neglected in all previous studies of r - process nucleosynthesis for such ejecta except those of @xcite , where their quantitative effects may depend on the adopted equation of state @xcite .",
    "the role of weak interactions for the electron fraction and the corresponding implications for r - process nucleosynthesis , however , demand further exploration in more detail , in particular also by basic , parametric modeling , because a multitude of uncertainties will prevent rigorous , self - consistent solutions of the full problem in the near future .",
    "such uncertainties are associated with , for example , the extreme complexities of 3d energy - dependent neutrino transport in relativistic environments , with the neutrino opacities of dense , potentially highly magnetized matter , and with neutrino - flavor oscillations at rapidly time - variable , largely aspherical conditions of neutrino emission .",
    "the main objective of our present work is a sensitivity study by the use of a parametric approach .",
    "it is intended to motivate further explorations of neutrino effects in relativistic ns - ns mergers in more detail and breadth . to this end",
    ", we set up a simplified and idealized theoretical framework to test the individual roles of the different weak interaction processes , considering the density and temperature evolution of fluid elements ejected from a prototype hydrodynamical , relativistic ns - ns merger model . for our parameter study",
    "we make assumptions about the neutrino emission properties that are guided by data taken from the literature .",

    "because of its low-@xmath1 distribution , the case neglecting @xmath0-interactions gives rise to an elemental abundance distribution similar to the one obtained in our previous studies @xcite .",

    ", some low-@xmath1 ( @xmath120 ) material can still lead to nucleosynthesis with fission recycling and a significant production of the third r - process peak , but the higher-@xmath1 ( 0.30.4 ) matter can now also contribute to the production of @xmath130 nuclei with a strong second @xmath131 peak .",
    "when ( anti)neutrino captures are included , too , nucleosynthesis with fission recycling does not take place any longer , but the final abundance distribution still resembles the one in the solar system fairly well .",

    "if @xmath121-captures on nucleons are switched on , the material is made of 76% r - process nuclei , and when ( anti)neutrino captures are effective , too , we find that 45% of the ejected matter is made of r - nuclei in case  1 , only 1.9% in case  2 , 67% in case  3 and 40% in case  4 . in the last four cases , a significant part of the material is made of @xmath42-particles ( @xmath136% in cases  1 and 4 , 50% in case  2 , and 17% in case  3 ) , and the remaining part consists of @xmath137 nuclei ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rpro_nu ] ) . despite the rather robust production of a solar - like distribution of r - nuclei , the absolute and relative amounts of r - material vary strongly from case to case , sensitively depending on the neutrino exposure of the ejecta as determined by the assumed properties of the neutrino emission .",

    "the total , mass - averaged nuclear energy - release rate that is available for heating the ejecta per unit of mass , the average temperature of the ejecta , and the average atomic mass number of the ejected abundance yields are plotted as functions of time for our six studied cases in fig .",
    "[ fig_qta ] .",
    "after some 10s and up to nearly one day , the energy release rates of all cases are fairly similar except for the treatment of neutrinos and @xmath0-interactions according to case  2 . in this case , the large electron fractions of the ejecta favor the production of light elements and only a small amount ( @xmath138 ) of the ejecta material consists of r - process nuclei ( fig .  [ fig_rpro_nu ] ) and is therefore subject to fast @xmath0-decays . at late times , typically after one day , an additional source of energy is found from the @xmath42-decay of long - lived heavy nuclei that can only be significantly produced when no @xmath0-interaction of nucleons are included below @xmath21 . despite the considerable differences of the nuclear energy - release rates at early times , the cooling evolution as measured by the mass - averaged temperatures is rather similar in all cases .",
    "the time evolution of the average nuclear mass number of the ejected material clearly shows that only without @xmath0-interactions of free nucleons a significant amount of fissile nuclei can be produced with @xmath139 reaching values up to 170 , which is slightly below the value of about 200 obtained when the @xmath1 distribution of the inner crust of a cold ns is considered as initial state ( see , in particular , * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper we reported the results of a parametric study to investigate how @xmath0-interactions of free nucleons can affect the @xmath1 evolution and mass distribution in ns merger ejecta and the corresponding nucleosynthesis . to this end",
    "we used the temperature - density trajectories of a large set of mass elements representing the @xmath146 of matter ejected in a relativistic merger simulation of a symmetric 1.35@xmath8 - 1.35@xmath8  ns binary with the non - zero temperature dd2 nuclear equation of state . using the total lepton number provided by our ns - ns merger simulation , we assume matter to be in @xmath0 equilibrium at the temperature of the hydrodynamical model and a fiducial density of @xmath147g@xmath19 .",
    "these conditions define the starting points of our post - processing of the composition histories of the considered ejecta elements , for which we take into account electron and positron captures as well as electron neutrino and antineutrino absorption on free neutrons and protons . below a density @xmath22 , where the temperature has decreased to @xmath148k ( or the neutron drip density , if matter below @xmath21 remains cooler than @xmath148k ) the full network calculation is applied instead of nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "our description of weak interactions of free nucleons includes weak magnetism and recoil corrections according to @xcite and @xcite . avoiding the complications of treating neutrino transport , we simply use exemplary data from publications for prescribing the neutrino luminosities and mean energies needed to compute the neutrino absorption rates in our parametric approach ( `` cases  14 '' ) .",
    "this elementary prescription also accounts for the still large uncertainties of the model predictions for the neutrino emission and its directional asymmetries in the generically three - dimensional merger scenario .",
    "our modeling strategy follows the spirit of previous , numerous parametric investigations of nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - driven wind of newly formed neutron stars in supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and of accretion tori around black holes as remnants of compact object mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , we track in detail the charged - current @xmath0-interactions of neutrinos with free nucleons , which determine the evolution of the electron fraction outside of the neutrino - trapping regime , and employ a full set of trajectories that characterizes the conditions in dynamical ejecta from the merging phase of a representative binary neutron star .",
    "these conditions differ from proto - neutron star and accretion - torus winds not only concerning the range of entropies .",
    "the ejecta , especially , possess much faster expansion velocities , which for the bulk of the matter can be 2550% of the speed of light , for some fraction of the ejecta even faster , whereas neutrino - driven proto - neutron star winds have typical velocities of 37% of the speed of light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutrino - driven winds from massive neutron stars as relics of ns mergers may achieve expansion velocities up to 810% of the speed of light @xcite , and the main mass of neutrino - driven outflows from bh - accretion tori can reach 1020% of the speed of light @xcite .",
    "the correspondingly shorter expansion time scales of dynamical merger ejecta can enable a strong r - process even for moderately low @xmath1 .",
    "our calculations confirm recent results of @xcite that solar - like r - process abundances are produced in dynamical ns merger ejecta even when @xmath0-reactions of free nucleons are taken into account and lead to a significant increase of the average electron fraction .",
    "in contrast to previous works , where charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions were ignored , however , also nuclei with mass numbers @xmath10 are ejected in larger amounts .    in detail ,",
    "our results can be summarized by the following points :    * ignoring @xmath0-interactions at densities @xmath149 , we confirm our previous results of @xcite that almost exclusively r - nuclei in the regime @xmath150 are produced , in spite of a moderate increase of the average ejecta @xmath1 associated with the assumption of @xmath0-equilibrium at density @xmath21 instead of our previous use of electron fractions of cold neutron star crust matter .",
    "* positron and electron - neutrino captures , enhanced by weak magnetism corrections ( which increase the absorption cross section of @xmath2 and reduce that of @xmath3 ) and supported by the @xmath42 effect , lead to a shift of the average ejecta @xmath1 towards higher values when matter expands downwards from an initial density of @xmath18g@xmath19 . *",
    "captures of @xmath121 cause a wide spread of the @xmath1 mass distribution , reaching from values of @xmath151 up to 0.40.5 .",
    "this reflects the wide range of thermodynamic conditions of the ejecta at @xmath21 with ejecta trajectories that describe cool as well as hot conditions .",
    "absorption processes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 take over when the temperature of the expanding matter has fallen to low values where @xmath121 absorptions become ineffective .",
    "these ( anti)neutrino captures tend to push @xmath1 towards the asymptotic value @xmath69 for @xmath2-@xmath3 capture equilibrium . the corresponding @xmath1 mass distributions ( at @xmath22 , where the full network calculation was started ) are rather narrow in all cases , with a spread of @xmath1 values of only 0.10.15 .",
    "the mean values of the distributions , however , vary between @xmath160.25 and @xmath160.45 , depending on the relative size of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 luminosities .",
    "the latter are highly uncertain and variable and are sensitive to the binary - parameter dependent merger dynamics , the nuclear equation of state , and the still not well determined directional asymmetries of the neutrino emission .",
    "* in the presence of @xmath0-interactions of free nucleons the temperature also plays an important role for the @xmath1 evolution of the ejecta .",
    "it is another aspect of the hydrodynamical merger models that depends on the system properties and the detailed ejection dynamics ( which differ between different ejecta components ) and can be numerically problematic , because resolution and numerical / artificial viscosity can have an influence on the accuracy of the determination of the thermal conditions .",
    "lower temperatures reduce the effects of @xmath121 captures but increase the importance of the @xmath42 effect ( thus pushing the average @xmath1 closer to 0.5 ) , whereas higher temperatures enhance @xmath121 captures but nevertheless have little influence on the final @xmath1 distribution at @xmath22 , for which the asymptotic value of @xmath2-@xmath3 capture equilibrium is more relevant than the initially fast @xmath121 captures .",
    "* in all investigated model cases , the production of heavy r - process matter with strong second and third abundance peaks and a near - solar distribution in the rare - earth region is a robust outcome .",
    "however , in contrast to previous results where weak interactions of free nucleons were ignored , also considerable amounts of matter are synthesized to @xmath10 nuclei .",
    "the strength of the production of @xmath152100 material is sensitive to the neutrino - emission properties that determine the ( anti)neutrino absorption . in extreme cases where @xmath1 gets close to 0.5",
    ", significant amounts of iron - group nuclei ( @xmath15360 ) can be ejected .",
    "the relative fraction of heavy r - process matter ( from the second peak upward ) in the ejecta therefore varies dramatically between the different investigated cases of neutrino - emission conditions and spans a range from more than 75% down to just 2% .",
    "we emphasize that our parametric approach is highly simplified and ignores important neutrino - transport effects like the exact spectral distribution of the neutrino fluxes , the direction dependence of the neutrino emission and corresponding precise radial dilution function , and the time evolution of the neutrino emission relative to the ejection time of the matter .",
    "nevertheless , our results , in support of those of @xcite and @xcite , have important consequences for the further exploration of the nucleosynthesis connected to compact binary mergers and the discussion of astrophysical implications .",
    "in fact , they demand a major revision of the current picture of r - process production in such events .    in view of our results",
    "it is obvious that a proper treatment of the neutrino physics , in particular of the neutrino irradiation of the ejected material , is essential for making quantitative predictions of the elemental yields and especially of the total mass of r - process material that is thrown out by the dynamical merger ejecta .",
    "approximations like the ones used in our study can be satisfactorily removed only when ultimately detailed , three - dimensional neutrino transport is consistently included in the hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our study suggests that the relative contributions of matter with @xmath152 , @xmath154 and @xmath150 are likely to depend strongly on the binary properties and even the direction of mass ejection , in addition to the equation of state dependence that was found for the electron - fraction distribution in the recent work of @xcite .",
    "different from expectations so far , this means that symmetric or nearly symmetric binary ns mergers could exhibit a significantly different ejecta composition than highly asymmetric ns - ns mergers and ns - bh mergers , in which the ns is disrupted before it can be swallowed by the bh . in the last two cases the lower - mass component develops an extended tidal tail , from which considerable amounts of cold , unshocked matter can be centrifugally ejected before the neutrino luminosities rise high and thus before neutrino exposure of these ejecta plays an important role .",
    "in such a situation the ejecta will not only be expelled highly anisotropically but will also carry a far dominant fraction of the mass in the form of @xmath150 nuclei as predicted in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , in symmetric or nearly symmetric ns mergers the contribution of @xmath155 material will be higher .",
    "if the merger remnant collapses to a bh on a millisecond time scale , neutrino exposure of the ejecta may be avoided , but the broad @xmath1 distribution caused by @xmath121 captures will allow for the production of @xmath133 nuclei with a strong second @xmath131 peak . if the merger remnant remains transiently or permanently stable , neutrino exposure of the dynamically expelled matter becomes important , enabling a higher production of @xmath152 species . for extreme cases of a luminous @xmath2 flux , the ejecta might then even be dominated by iron - group nuclei including radioactive nickel isotopes .",
    "in particular , however , the exact composition and the relative fraction of high - mass and low - mass species could depend on the direction of the mass ejection .",
    "if most of the neutrino flux is emitted to the polar directions due to the rotational deformation of the merger remnant , matter expelled near the equatorial plane will receive less neutrino exposure in addition to its potentially faster escape .",
    "this will allow for more neutron - rich conditions close to the equator whereas polar ejecta may contain more proton - rich contributions .",
    "future , more complete merger models with neutrino transport will have to clarify these possibilities .",
    "since the photon opacity , @xmath156 , of the expanding gaseous ejecta is strongly dependent on the presence of high - opacity , complex ions ( the lanthanides ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the relative contribution of trans - iron elements to the ejecta will have a severe impact on the peak luminosity , @xmath157 , peak time , @xmath158 , and the effective peak temperature , @xmath159 , of the electromagnetic transient that is expected from the radioactively heated , dynamical ejecta cloud (  macronova  or  kilonova  , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the current picture of merger - type and remnant - type dependent redder ( near - infrared ) or bluer emission @xcite and in particular of the envisioned late - time infra - red radiation component from the dynamical ejecta @xcite might require revision or extension in view of our results .    finally , it is evident that the strong impact of neutrinos on the neutron - to - proton ratio and the nuclear composition of the dynamic merger ejecta must move neutrino oscillations into the focus of interest .",
    "it will be necessary to study the effects of collective neutrino oscillations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) with similiar intensity as this subject currently receives in the context of the neutrino emission from newly born neutron stars in supernovae .",
