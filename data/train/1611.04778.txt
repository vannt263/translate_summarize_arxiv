    "the basic effect of the channeling process in a straight crystal is in an anomalously large distance which a charged projectile can penetrate moving along a crystallographic direction ( either planar or axial ) experiencing collective action of the electrostatic field of the crystal atoms @xcite .",
    "the channeling can also occur in a bent crystal provided the bending radius @xmath0 is large enough in comparison with the critical one @xmath1 @xcite .    a particle trapped into the channel oscillates in the transverse direction while propagating along a crystallographic direction .",
    "the channeling oscillations give rise to a specific type of radiation ,  the channeling radiation ( chr ) @xcite .",
    "its intensity depends on the type and the energy of a projectile as well as on the type of a crystal and a crystallographic direction .",
    "the emission of chr by an ultra - relativistic projectile in a straight crystal is well studied ( see , for example , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the motion of a channeling particle in a bent crystal contains two components : the channeling oscillations and circular motion along the bent centerline .",
    "the latter motion gives rise to the synchrotron - type radiation ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total spectrum of radiation formed by an ultra - relativistic projectile in a bent crystal bears the features of both the chr and sr .",
    "various aspects of radiation formed in crystals bent with the constant radius @xmath0 were discussed in refs . @xcite although with various degree of detail and numerical analysis . a quantitative analysis of the emission spectra based on accurate simulation of the channeling process was carried out for silicon and diamond crystals @xcite .",
    "the condition of stable channeling in a bent crystal , @xmath2 , @xcite implies that the bending radius exceeds greatly the ( typical ) curvature radius of the channeling oscillations .",
    "therefore , the sr modifies mainly the soft - photon part of the spectrum .",
    "this part of the spectrum is especially interesting in connection with the concept of a crystalline undulator ( cu ) which implies propagation of ultra - relativistic projectiles along periodically bent crystallographic planes @xcite . by means of cu",
    "it is feasible to produce undulator - like radiation in the hundreds of kev up to the mev photon energy range .",
    "the intensity and characteristic frequencies of the radiation can be varied by changing the type of channeling particles , the beam energy , the crystal type and the parameters of periodic bending ( see recent review @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the range of bending amplitudes , @xmath3 , and period , @xmath4 , within which the operation of cu is feasible for projectiles of the energies @xmath5 gev are : @xmath6  , @xmath7 @xmath8 m . even more exciting ( although much more challenging and distant ) is the possibility of generating a stimulated emission of the free - electron laser ( fel ) type by means of cu @xcite .",
    "this novel source of light can generate , at least in theory , the stimulated emission in the photon energy range @xmath9 kev ( i.e. hard x and gamma range ) which are not achievable in conventional fels .",
    "up to now , several experiments have been ( and planned to be ) carried out to measure the channeling parameters and the radiation emitted by electrons and positrons in periodically bent crystalline structures prepared by several different technologies @xcite .",
    "the recent attempts include experiments with 195855 mev electron beam at the mainz microtron ( mami ) facility @xcite carried out with cus manufactured in aarhus university ( denmark ) using the molecular beam epitaxy technology to produce strained - layer si@xmath10ge@xmath11 superlattices with varying germanium content @xcite .",
    "the cus of this type are planned to be used in the coming experiments at slac with 10 - 35 gev electron and positron facet beam @xcite .",
    "a set of experiments was performed with few gev positrons at cern @xcite with the cu based on synthetic diamond doped with boron @xcite .",
    "other related experiments include investigations of the radiation of sub - gev electrons in a bent silicon crystal @xcite and of the effectiveness of deflection of multi - gev electrons by a thin si crystal @xcite .",
    "the technologies , available currently for preparing periodically bent crystals , do not immediately allow for lowering the values of bending period down to tens of microns range or even smaller keeping , simultaneously , the bending amplitude in the range of several angstroms .",
    "these ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are most favourable to achieve high intensity of radiation in a cu @xcite .",
    "one of the potential options to lower the bending period is related to using crystals heavier than diamond ( @xmath12 ) and silicon ( @xmath13 ) to propagate ultra - relativistic electrons and positrons . in heavier crystals , both",
    "the depth , @xmath14 , of the interplanar potential and its the maximum gradient , @xmath15 , attain larger values , resulting in the enhancement of the critical channeling angle @xmath16 @xcite and reduction of the critical radius @xmath17 @xcite .    from this end , the tungsten crystal ( @xmath18 ) is a good candidate for the study .",
    "this crystal was used in channeling experiments with both heavy @xcite and light @xcite ultra - relativistic projectiles . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the straight tungsten crystals show high structure perfection .",
    "this feature is also of a great importance for successful experimental realization of the cu idea @xcite . in the cited paper",
    "the comparison was carried out of the ( 110 ) planar channels in tungsten vs. silicon . in particular , the critical radius in w(110 ) was estimated as @xmath19 cm which is seven times smaller than that in si(110 ) .",
    "this allows one , at least in theory , to consider periodic bending with @xmath20 @xmath8 m .",
    "indeed , matching the maximum curvature of periodic bending @xmath21 to @xmath22 one estimates @xmath23 @xmath8 m for @xmath24  .",

    "the model of binary collisions was exploited in ref .",

    "three - dimensional simulations of the propagation of ultra - relativistic projectiles through the crystal were performed by using the mbn explorerpackage @xcite .",

    "propagation of an ultra - relativistic projectile of the charge @xmath26 and mass @xmath27 through a crystalline medium can be described in terms of classical relativistic dynamics .",
    "this framework implies integration of the following two coupled equations of motion : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electrostatic potential due to the crystal constituents , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 stand , respectively , for the coordinate , velocity and momentum of the particle at instant @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the relativistic lorentz factor , @xmath34 is the particle s energy , and @xmath35 is the speed of light .    in mbn explorer , the differential equations ( [ methodology : eq.01 ] ) are integrated using the forth - order runge - kutta scheme with variable time step . at each integration step , the potential @xmath36 is calculated as the sum of atomic potentials @xmath37 due to the atoms located inside the sphere of the cut - off radius @xmath38 with the center at the instant location of the projectile .",
    "the value @xmath38 is chosen large enough to ensure negligible contribution to the sum from the distant atoms located at @xmath39 .",
    "the search for such atoms is facilitated by using the linked cell algorithm implemented in mbn explorer@xcite .",
    "the algorithm implies ( i ) a subdivision of the sample into cubic cells of a smaller size , and ( ii ) an assignment of each atom to a certain cell . as a result ,",
    "the total number of computational operations is reduced considerably .    to simulate the motion along a particular crystallographic plane with the miller indices @xmath40 the following algorithm",
    "is used @xcite .    as a first step",

    "the position vectors of the nodes @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) within the simulation box are generated in accordance with the type of the bravais cell of the crystal and using the pre - defined values of the lattice vectors .",
    "mbn explorercontains several build - in options which allow further modification of generated crystalline structures .",
    "the options relevant to modeling linear and bent crystals are as follows @xcite .    * _ rotation _ of the sample around a specified axis .",
    "this option allows one to simulate the crystalline structure oriented along any desired crystallographic direction .",
    "in particular , this option allows one to choose the direction of the @xmath42-axis well away from major crystallographic axes , thus avoiding the axial channeling ( when not desired ) .",
    "* displacement of the nodes in the transverse direction @xmath43 with respect to a specified @xmath42-axis : @xmath46 where @xmath47 . as a result ,",

    "much larger than the crystal thickness @xmath49 ( along the @xmath42 direction ) , the displacement acquires the form : @xmath50 * the nodes determine positions of the atoms in an ideal crystal .",
    "more realistic structure includes the probability of the atoms to be displaced from their equilibrium positions ( the nodes ) due to _ thermal vibrations _ corresponding to the given temperature @xmath51 .",
    "thus , for each atom , the cartesian components of the displacement are selected randomly by means of the normal distribution corresponding to fixed root - mean - square amplitude @xmath52 of thermal vibrations .",

    "the parameter @xmath59 allows one to change the phase - shift of the harmonic bending .",
    "+ in a special case @xmath60 , this options provides simulation of linearly polarized periodically bent crystalline structure which is an important element of a crystalline undulator .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned options , mbn explorerallows one to model periodically bent crystalline structures by generating periodic ( harmonic ) displacement of the nodes , to construct binary structures ( for example , si@xmath10ge@xmath61 superlattices ) by introducing random or regular substitution of atoms in the initial structure with atoms of another type .",
    "also , the simulation box can be cut along specified faces , thus allowing tailoring the generated crystalline sample to achieve the desired form of the sample .",

    "initial transverse coordinates , @xmath63 , and velocities , @xmath64 , are generated randomly accounting for the conditions at the crystal entrance ( i.e. , the crystal orientation , beam emittance and energy distribution of the particles ) .",
    "a particular feature of mbn exploreris in simulating the crystalline environment `` on the fly '' , i.e. in the course of propagating the projectile .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a dynamic simulation box which shifts following the particle ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .    taking into account randomness in sampling the incoming projectiles and in positions of the lattice atoms due to the thermal fluctuations ,",
    "one concludes that each simulated trajectory corresponds to a unique crystalline environment .",
    "thus , all simulated trajectories are statistically independent and can be analyzed further to quantify the channeling process as well as the emitted radiation .",
    "the averaged spectral distribution of the energy emitted within the cone @xmath65 with respect to the incident beam ( i.e. along the @xmath42 axis ) is computed as follows @xmath66 here , @xmath67 stands for the frequency of radiation , @xmath68 is the solid angle corresponding to the emission angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the sum is carried over the simulated trajectories of the total number @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the energy per unit frequency and unit solid angle emitted by the projectile moving along the @xmath73th trajectory .",
    "the resulting spectrum accounts for all mechanisms of the radiation formation : ( a ) channeling radiation ( chr ) due to the channeling segments , ( b ) coherent and incoherent bremsstrahlung ( brs ) due to the over - barrier motion .",
    "in addition to these , the motion along the arc in a bent crystal results in the synchrotron - type radiation .",
    "the numerical procedures implemented in mbn explorerto calculate the distributions @xmath72 @xcite are based on the quasi - classical formalism due to baier and katkov @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this method is that it combines classical description of the motion in an external field with the quantum corrections due to the radiative recoil quantified by the ratio @xmath74 . in the limit @xmath75 one can use the classical description of the radiative process which is adequate to describe the emission spectra by electrons and positrons of the sub - gev energy range ( see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the corrections lead to strong modifications of the radiation spectra of multi - gev projectiles channeling in crystalline undulators @xcite and in bent crystals @xcite .",
    "using the algorithm outlined above , classical trajectories were simulated for @xmath25 mev electrons and positrons incident along the ( 110 ) crystallographic plane in straight and bent tungsten crystals of the thickness @xmath76 @xmath8 m along the incident beam direction . in a bent crystal",
    ", the channeling condition @xcite implies that the centrifugal force @xmath77 is smaller than the maximum interplanar force @xmath78 .",

    "[ figure.01 ] illustrate a variety of features which characterize the motion of a charged projectile in an oriented crystal : the channeling mode , the over - barrier motion , the dechanneling and the rechanneling processes , rare events of hard collisions etc .",
    "the channeling motion is more pronounced and regular for positrons than for electrons .",
    "positively charged projectiles tend to move in between the atomic planes , i.e. in the region with lower volume density of the crystal constituents . as a result , they tend to stay in the channeling mode much longer than negatively charged particles , which move in the vicinity of the atomic chains being attracted by positively charged nuclei . on the other hand , although the electrons have higher rate of the dechanneling ( i.e. , leaving the channeling mode of motion due to the collisions ) , the inverse phenomenon , the re - channeling , is also more frequent for them @xcite .",
    "therefore , as it is seen in the figure , quite often the electron trajectory consists of several channeling segments separated by the intervals of the over - barrier motion . the nearly harmonic pattern of the channeling oscillations for positrons as well as strong anharmonicity in the electron channeling oscillations are well - known phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these effects can be explained qualitatively within the framework of the continuous potential model by comparing the profiles of the interplanar potentials for the two types of projectiles ( nearly harmonic for positrons and extremely non - harmonic for electrons ) .",
    "apart from providing the possibility of illustrative comparison , the simulated trajectories allow one to quantify the channeling process in terms of several parameters and functional dependencies which can be generated on the basis of statistical analysis of the trajectories @xcite .",

    "it is seen that in most cases , the spectral distribution of radiation formed in the crystalline medium approaches from above that in amorphous tungsten .",

    "the only exception from this scenario are the spectral dependencies calculated for the smaller aperture in the straight ( @xmath148 ) and nearly straight ( @xmath206 ) crystals . in these cases ,",

    "hence , for larger values of the bending parameter the intensity of the coherent brs emitted in the forward direction increases .",
    "it is a well - established fact that channeling oscillations of electrons have a strong anharmonic character which is a direct consequence of a strong deviation of the electron interplanar potential from a harmonic shape ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the period of oscillations varies with the amplitude , as it is illustrated by two simulated electron trajectories presented in fig .",

    "indeed , for a positively charged projectile the interplanar potential can be approximated by parabola in most part of the channel thus leading to close resemblance between the channeling motion of positrons and the undulator motion . as a result , for each value of the emission angle @xmath69 the spectral distribution of chr in a straight crystal reveals a set of narrow and equally spaced peaks ( harmonics ) .",
    "the harmonic frequencies , @xmath211 , of chr of positrons can be estimated from @xmath212 here , @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the frequency and the undulator parameter of the channeling oscillations .",

    "[ figure.04 ] .    as the bending curvature increases , the spectral distributions of radiation emitted by positrons become modified following two different scenarios .",
