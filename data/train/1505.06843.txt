    "the skyrme model @xcite is a nonlinear theory of pion fields that has topological soliton solutions .",

    "the conserved topological charge is interpreted as the baryon number @xmath1 , and the minimal energy static solutions for each integer @xmath1 are called skyrmions .",
    "they can be treated as rigid bodies , free to rotate in space and also in isospace ( the three - dimensional space of the pion fields ) . when the rotational motion is quantised , the skyrmions are models for nucleons and nuclei . in particular the @xmath0 skyrmions ,",

    "each skyrmion has three position coordinates and three orientational coordinates , so two - skyrmion dynamics involves twelve coordinates @xcite .",
    "a truncation to ten coordinates has been useful for modelling the deuteron bound state @xcite , but no proper discussion of two - nucleon scattering is possible with this truncation .",
    "an alternative is a classical approach , using the idea that a classically spinning skyrmion is a reasonable model of a nucleon @xcite .",
    "the classical angular velocity of the skyrmion is fixed to match the quantised spin and isospin of the nucleon .",
    "scattering of non - spinning skyrmions was first performed using an axially symmetric ansatz @xcite , the first full - field simulation was reported in @xcite , and multi - charge skyrmionscattering was considered in @xcite .",
    "the scattering of spinning skyrmions representing nucleons was considered by gisiger and paranjape @xcite , and they obtained analytical formulae for the scattering angle for large impact parameters .",
    "there has also been some recent work on multi - charge , purely isospinning skyrmions@xcite .",
    "a systematic , numerical investigation of skyrmion scattering without spin , at moderate and small impact parameters @xcite , confirmed that matter is exchanged between the skyrmions when the skyrmions are close , and also showed that a substantial rotation of the skyrmion s orientation can occur .",
    "here , we numerically investigate the scattering of two classically spinning @xmath0 skyrmions to model proton - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - neutron scattering at various impact parameters , including head - on collisions .",
    "we are particularly interested in the change in the polarisation states of the nucleons when they scatter , and also in finding evidence , using our classical approximation , for the deuteron and for the known two - nucleon resonance states .",

    "nucleons have both spin and isospin half .",
    "a proton is an isospin - up state , and a neutron is an isospin - down state .    due to the spherical symmetry of the hedgehogansatz , @xmath63 .",
    "something similar is true for the @xmath46 toroidal skyrmionwhere @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we shall make use of these properties later .",
    "for an in - depth discussion of skyrmionquantisation we point the reader to @xcite .",
    "for the model to be relevant to nuclear physics it requires calibration .",
    "adkins and nappi @xcite calibrated the quantised @xmath0 skyrmionagainst the masses of the spin @xmath65 nucleons , the spin @xmath66 delta resonances , and the pions , finding @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 and @xmath69 mev ( so @xmath70 ) .",
    "this calibration assumes that rigid rotation is a good approximation , but the surface fields of the delta are rotating close to the speed of light and pion radiation is very strong .",
    "therefore , for the delta , the approximation is not reliable and this calibration is not valid for higher charge skyrmions .",
    "recently , manton and lau calibrated the skyrme model against the states of carbon-12 @xcite and found @xmath71 to be optimal . for the @xmath0 skyrmion",
    "this leads to an energy ( skyrmionmass ) @xmath72 , @xmath73 and an rms matter radius @xmath74 in skyrme units .",
    "the calibration requires @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 .",
    "planck s constant in skyrme units is always @xmath77 so for this calibration @xmath78 .",
    "these are the values we use for our simulations and throughout this paper : @xmath79 the resulting nucleon mass is the static @xmath0 skyrmionenergy @xmath80 plus the spin - energy contribution , @xmath81 , which in physical units is @xmath82 with our calibration @xmath83 mev , about @xmath84 larger than the physical nucleon mass @xmath85 mev .",
    "also the rms matter radius is @xmath86 fm .",
    "the @xmath46 toroidal skyrmion can also be quantised as a rigid body .",
    "the two lowest - energy states are a spin 1 , isospin 0 state representing the deuteron , and a spin 0 , isospin 1 state representing the low - energy resonance known as the diproton / dineutron . with our calibration , and following the quantisation procedure in @xcite , we find the mass for the deuteron to be @xmath87 mev , which is similarly larger than the experimental value of @xmath88 mev .",
    "we also find the rms matter radius to be @xmath89 fm , which is less than half the experimentally found rms radius of the deuteron @xmath90 fm , showing that rigid - body quantisation of the static @xmath46 skyrmiongives a too tightly bound representation of the loosely bound deuteron .",
    "a better representation of the deuteron in the skyrme model was obtained in @xcite . using a yang ",
    "mills instanton ansatz for the skyrme field @xcite , an additional , radial degree of freedom could be included , allowing the two @xmath0 skyrmions to separate . in the deuteron state , this radial degree of freedom oscillates with the zero point motion of a vibrational ground state .",
    "we will see later that modest oscillations of the radial degree of freedom are generated when spinning skyrmions collide classically .",
    "although this calibration is not optimal for the proton , neutron or deuteron , we have found that the processes discussed later are not sensitive to small changes of calibration .",
    "it was discovered by adkins , nappi and witten @xcite that the properly normalised wavefunctions for the proton and neutron in spin - up and spin - down states , along the @xmath91-axis , are @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath4 matrix that controls the @xmath0 skyrmion s orientation and @xmath94 .",
    "it has been proposed that these wavefunctions can be used to identify protons and neutrons as classically spinning skyrmions @xcite .",
    "this is because each wavefunction has maximal magnitude on a great circle in @xmath4 and motion along the great circle is equivalent to a @xmath95 rotation of the skyrmionin space .",
    "the phase of the wavefunction changes by @xmath96 around the circle , so the spin is @xmath65 .",
    "the wavefunctions of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are maximal when the hedgehog skyrmion ( initially in its standard orientation ) is simply rotated about the @xmath91-axis , whereas the wavefunctions of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are maximal when the skyrmion is flipped over , and then rotated about the @xmath91-axis .",
    "a hedgehogskyrmionspinning with angular frequency @xmath101 about the @xmath91-axis is obtained by acting with the isorotation matrix @xmath102 .",
    "this isospinning skyrmionis simultaneously spinning about its white - black axis in space . it has spin and isospin projections @xmath103 , @xmath104 , which are opposite .",
    "an anticlockwise spin , @xmath105 , corresponds to an @xmath98 state and a clockwise spin , @xmath106 , corresponds to a @xmath97 state .",
    "the isorotation matrix @xmath107 flips the skyrmionby @xmath108 about the @xmath109-axis , and rotates it with angular frequency @xmath101 about the @xmath91-axis . such an isospinning skyrmion has @xmath110 and @xmath104 , so the spin and isospin projections are now equal .",
    "an anticlockwise spin , @xmath105 , corresponds to an @xmath100 state and a clockwise spin , @xmath106 , corresponds to a @xmath99 state .",
    "the replacement @xmath111 produces the spin flips @xmath112 and @xmath113 because @xmath114 .",
    "this leads to the identification that a skyrmionspinning anticlockwise about its white - black axis is always a neutron and a skyrmionspinning clockwise about the same axis is always a proton , as shown in figure [ spinning skyrme ] .",
    "this is regardless of the orientation of the axis in space .",
    "to classically model a nucleon whose projected spin has magnitude @xmath65 we require @xmath115 , so @xmath116 as @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we use @xmath119 throughout this paper . with this angular velocity ,",
    "the surface fields of the skyrmionare not rotating close to the speed of light .",
    "there are classical models of the two lowest - energy quantum states of the @xmath46 toroidal skyrmion too . in the deuteron state ,",
    "the torus spins around an axis orthogonal to the symmetry axis of the torus , with spin 1 .",
    "the colour orientation is arbitrary and unchanging in time , as the deuteron has isospin zero . in the dineutron / diproton state",
    "the torus is coloured as in figure [ b2 skyrme ] , and the colours circulate steadily , so that the isospin is 1 .",
    "the black and white regions on the circular edge of the torus are fixed .",
    "the torus is not spatially rotating , as the dineutron / diproton has spin zero .",
    "the torus does not rotate about its symmetry axis in either state .",
    "if it did , the constraint @xmath120 would imply that the state had non - zero spin and non - zero isospin .",
    "we are interested in classically replicating nucleon scattering , namely proton - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - neutron scattering .",
    "to do this we identify protons and neutrons as spinning skyrmions , as discussed above . instead of colliding non - spinning skyrmionsas in some previous work @xcite",
    ", we numerically collide spinning skyrmions .",
    "we initiate a collision by forming two configurations @xmath121 and @xmath122 out of spinning and translated hedgehogskyrmions , @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are two @xmath44 time - dependent rotation matrices and @xmath126 are the locations of the skyrmions .",
    "we choose @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is large compared with the skyrmionradius .",
    "then , using the product ansatz , we create an initial configuration of two skyrmionsboosted towards each other , at velocities @xmath129 , by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the usual lorentz boost factor .",
    "each skyrmionis initially moving parallel to the @xmath109-axis .",
    "@xmath132 is the impact parameter chosen to give the desired orbital angular momentum @xmath133 , where @xmath80 is the skyrmion mass .",
    "we define transverse polarisation to be where the skyrmion s white - black axis is aligned parallel to the @xmath91-axis and linear polarisation to be where the skyrmion s white - black axis is aligned parallel to the @xmath109-axis .",
    "we numerically evolve these initial configurations using the field equations obtained from the skyrme lagrangian density ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "we use a finite difference leap - frog numerical algorithm on a suitably large lattice .",
    "leap - frog was chosen because it is a symplectic integrator .",
    "all of the simulations are presented as videos at http://www.bristoltheory.org/people/david.foster/skyrmevideos/ ; we urge the reader to view these videos .",
    "there are no physical bound states in the @xmath134-proton or @xmath134-neutron systems",
    ". however , a @xmath134-proton low energy resonance is observed in proton - proton collisions and is called the diproton .",
    "it has spin @xmath135 and isospin @xmath136 .",
    "the dineutron is the corresponding @xmath134-neutron resonance .",
    "neutron - neutron scattering is less easy to achieve than proton - proton scattering , but the dineutron resonance is observed as a decay product of the neutron - rich nucleus beryllium-16 , @xmath137be @xcite , where it is energetically favourable for @xmath137be to decay to @xmath138be by simultaneously ejecting two neutrons .",
    "the trajectories of the two detected neutrons trace back to the same point , where they form a state of lifetime @xmath139 s. the @xmath137be and @xmath138be ground states are both @xmath135 , hence the dineutron is a @xmath135 state .",
    "the relative energy of the two neutrons is found to be @xmath140 mev .",
    "so , assuming no other radiation , the neutrons separate with initial speed @xmath141 .",
    "there is no significant electrostatic repulsion between two neutrons , and since we have not included coulomb effects in our skyrme model , our simulations of skyrmion scattering are likely to better model the dineutron rather than the diproton .",

    "it has the quantum numbers @xmath135 and @xmath142 which is consistent with the short - lived dineutron state observed in the decay of @xmath137be .",
    "for both polarisations , the black and white regions alternate around the circular edge of the torus .    the scattering shown in figure",
    "[ j0i1-scattering ] is for a head - on collision of two neutrons . for both polarisations ,",
    "the outgoing skyrmions are moving at right angles to the incoming skyrmions , and they are spinning as neutrons too , because of isospin conservation .",
    "similar right angle scattering was observed for non - spinning skyrmions in @xcite .    in the case of transverse polarisation",
    "the outgoing direction of motion is precisely the direction of the initial polarisation axis .",
    "there is another interesting phenomenon : the polarisation axis , the white - black axis , jumps by @xmath144 degrees during the scattering , from being parallel to the @xmath91-axis to being parallel to the @xmath109-axis .",
    "this is possible because of the way the skyrmions merge and break up , such that each outgoing skyrmion is a combination of half of each incoming skyrmion .    from our numerical simulations we can observe the sense of the polarisation , before and after the collision .",
    "for example , the neutron incoming from the negative @xmath109-direction ( the left ) has its polarisation in the positive @xmath91-direction , and the neutron that is outgoing in the positive @xmath91-direction has its polarisation in the negative @xmath109-direction .",
    "the result can be stated in a more invariant way , both for @xmath134-neutron and @xmath134-proton right angle scattering .",
    "each particle , incoming or outgoing , has a momentum @xmath145 and classical spin @xmath146 .",
    "the two incoming particles and the two outgoing particles all have the same value for the vector @xmath147 , so the scattering is accompanied by spin rotation .    in the case of linear polarisation",
    "the outgoing direction of motion can be any direction at right angles to the @xmath109-axis , and is determined by the precise initial colour orientations .",
    "the scattering shown in figure [ j0i1-scattering ] has been selected to be from the @xmath109-direction to the @xmath91-direction .",
    "again there is a @xmath144 degree jump in the polarisation axis , so that after scattering the neutrons are still linearly polarised .",
    "there is however a flip in the sense of the polarisation . in our example , for both incoming neutrons the polarisation is outwards , but for the outgoing neutrons it is inwards .",
    "helicity , @xmath148 , is therefore the same for incoming and outgoing particles , and this result is more general , holding in the diproton case too .",
    "although the scattering here is classical , the results suggest that quantised @xmath134-neutron and @xmath134-proton scattering depends strongly on polarisations . for skyrmions",
    "transversely polarised in the @xmath91-direction , the outgoing motion breaks the axial symmetry around the @xmath109-axis , because the outgoing particle motion is concentrated in the @xmath91-direction .",
    "also , the outgoing polarisations are completely determined",
    ". it would be interesting to compare these classical simulations with physical proton - proton scattering in which the polarisations of both incoming particles and both outgoing particles were measured .",
    "the deuteron is a stable , two - baryon bound state comprised of a proton and a neutron .",
    "it has been understood as the quantised ground state of the @xmath46 skyrmion with spin @xmath149 and isospin @xmath150 .",
    "here we are interested in classically modelling deuteron formation , so we numerically collide two spinning skyrmions , representing a proton and neutron with transverse polarisation parallel to the @xmath91-axis .",
    "the deuteron total angular momentum projected along the @xmath91-direction has three contributions , the individual spins @xmath151 and @xmath152 of the proton and neutron , which are @xmath153 , and the orbital angular momentum , an integer @xmath154 , combining to give @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "quantum models predict that the @xmath156 state dominates , and the deuteron spin is accounted for by the proton and neutron spins being aligned .",
    "we can replicate the deuteron state by colliding two skyrmionshead - on , where one skyrmionis spinning as a neutron with @xmath157 and the other skyrmionhas the opposite orientation of the white - black axis and is spinning as a proton with @xmath158 .",
    "the impact parameter is zero , so @xmath156 .",
    "the deuteron has slightly lower energy than a proton plus a neutron , so we can not use a simple energetic argument to choose an initial collision speed .",
    "whatever the initial speed , some energy needs to be dissipated in order to truly produce a deuteron .",
    "it is therefore a considerable surprise that our collisions do produce a configuration similar to what is expected for a deuteron in a classical skyrmion model .",
    "there is , however , a problem to be overcome .",
    "if we minimise the energy by choosing initial speed @xmath159 , and the initial relative orientations arbitrary , then averaged over time the skyrmions repel .",
    "this is because the skyrmions are spinning , and most of the time the colours do not match , producing a repulsion . only briefly do the colours match , and the skyrmions attract .",
    "similar behaviour was observed for two spinning baby skyrmions in 2-dimensions @xcite .",

    "they also spin slowly about a coloured axis as they separate  this is inferred from a scattering of skyrmionswith larger initial spin .",

    "this is because skyrmionsin the attractive channel accelerate towards each other and the excess energy quickly breaks the torus up . in the transversely polarised case",
    "the excess energy is less and goes into the vibrational mode .",
    "this shows that polarisation has implications for proton - neutron fusion .",
    "recently an excited proton - neutron state has been discovered @xcite , called the dibaryon .",

    "these have close to spin @xmath66 each , but rapidly lose energy , presumably by pion radiation , although this is hard to see in the simulation .",
    "the spinning skyrmions stop and return to form a spinning @xmath46 skyrmion again .",
    "this replicates the experimental result that two pions are emitted , and a deuteron remains .",
    "the transient production of spin @xmath66 particles matches other theoretical models of the dibaryon resonance involving two deltas with spin @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "our simulation shows that ( in the proton - neutron centre - of - mass frame ) the deltas are emitted transversely to the line of collision , but parallel to the proton and neutron polarisation axes .",
    "each delta is linearly polarised , and because its spin axis is an axis perpendicular to the white - black axis , it is in a superposition of states with different charges .",
    "this superposition is not surprising , because the average charge emerging along the positive or negative @xmath91-axis is half the proton charge .",
    "we have also attempted to produce a @xmath164 , @xmath161 dibaryon state by colliding a proton skyrmionand a neutron skyrmionwith the spin polarisations transverse but opposite , so that the spin angular momenta cancel .",
    "the orbital angular momentum is @xmath171 , which requires the same initial velocities , but an impact parameter @xmath172 .",

    "this is shown dynamically online.,title=\"fig : \" ]    here , the toroidal skyrmionalso appears but is not an excited deuteron , because it forms in the plane normal to the initial orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "in this case , one might anticipate the torus to be spinning about its symmetry axis , but it would then have non - zero isospin , which is not allowed . on closer inspection one observes that the @xmath46 torus is not spinning , but each @xmath0 skyrmioncan be interpreted as a wave propagating along the outer edge , such that the colours do not rotate .",
    "this curious dynamical configuration is not a dibaryon .    in summary ,",
    "dibaryon formation can be observed in classical skyrmion scattering , but only if the initial polarisations of the proton and neutron are transverse and parallel .",
    "in this work we have classically scattered spinning skyrmionsto model nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "the initial spin angular momenta are fixed to be @xmath173 .",
    "interestingly , we have found short - lived states modelling the dineutron / diproton and the dibaryon .",
    "we have also found that in a collision with the quantum numbers of the deuteron , the skyrmions do not scatter , but merge into a spinning and oscillating form of the @xmath46 toroidal skyrmion .",
    "so , even without quantisation , the skyrme model usefully captures important physical features of two - nucleon dynamics .",
    "this is gratifying but a little surprising , especially when it is recalled that our long - lived deuteron state was made from two skyrmionscolliding with a larger kinetic energy than that needed to produce the short - lived dineutron / diproton .",
    "our most valuable observations concern the polarisations .",
    "the classically spinning skyrmions must be polarised along some axis , so we inevitably have complete polarisation information for the nucleons before and after scattering .",
    "such complete information is hard to obtain experimentally , and also difficult to determine in more traditional nucleon - nucleon potential models .",
    "classically we also fix the impact parameter .",
    "several of our simulations lead to right angle scattering of the skyrmions .",
    "experimentally one can not fix the impact parameter , but one can focus on scattering events where there is right angle scattering ( in the centre - of - mass frame ) , and can hope that these are modelled by our collisions . for such events ,",
    "our skyrmion simulations make strong predictions for the polarisations .    we have observed that in a @xmath134-proton or @xmath134-neutron head - on collision , with total angular momentum zero , if the particles are transversely polarised initially then they are transversely polarised finally .",
    "if they are linearly polarised initially they are linearly polarised finally . in both cases",
    "the polarisation axes rotate through a right angle . moreover , there is a fixed plane containing the initial and final momenta and also the polarisations .",
    "the sense of the polarisations is determined by conservation of @xmath147 for each particle in the transverse polarisation case , and conservation of @xmath148 in the linear polarisation case .",
    "it would be very interesting if something similar was observed experimentally .    in our simulations of a proton - neutron collision",
    "leading to the dibaryon , with total spin 3 , we have seen the transient production of two linearly polarised deltas each with spin close to @xmath66 .",
    "we intend to extend our numerical simulations to model nucleon - deuteron and deuteron - deuteron collisions , possibly forming helium-3 , tritium or helium-4 bound states .",
    "the physical spins must be correctly modelled in the initial data , and the results will differ from those obtained with non - spinning skyrmions .",
