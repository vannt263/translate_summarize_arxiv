    "detection of a large number of events is one of the big challenges in microlensing searches .",
    "classical solution to this challenge is observing fields with greatest density of stars such as the galactic bulge ( alcock et al .",
    "1997a ; udalski et al .",
    "1997 ; alard & guibert 1997 ) and the magellanic clouds ( alcock et al .",
    "1997b , 1997c ; ansari et al .",
    "while the use of such crowded fields increases the event rate , it also limits the precision of the photometry due to blending ( di stefano & esin 1995 ; woniak & paczyski 1997 ; han 1997 ; alard 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , with the use of the classical method based on psf photometry one can monitor only stars with resolved images , and thus the number of source stars is limited by crowding .",
    "these problems of the classical method of microlensing experiments can be resolved with the newly developed technique of difference image analysis ( dia , alard 1998 , 1999 ; alard & lupton 1998 ; alcock et al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ; melchior et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "since the dia method detects and measures the variation of source star flux by subtracting an observed image from a convolved and normalized reference image , one can measure light variations even for unresolved stars . by using the dia method",
    ", one can not only improve the photometric precision by removing the effect of blending but also increase the number of detected events by including unresolved stars into monitoring sources .",
    "in addition , the dia method allows one to overcome the restriction of conducting lensing experiments toward only resolved star fields and thus can extend our ability to probe extra - galactic machos ( gould 1995 , 1996 ; han 1996 ; han & gould 1996 ; crotts & tomaney 1996 ; tomaney & crotts 1996 ; ansari et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .    however , the principal problem with the dia method in microlensing experiments is that , by its very nature , it has difficulties in measuring the unamplified flux ( baseline flux , @xmath0 ) of a source star .",
    "this is because the observed light curve of a microlensing event obtained by the dia method , @xmath5 , results from the combination of the true amplification @xmath6 and the baseline flux , i.e.   @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the source star fluxes measured from the image obtained during the progress of the event and the reference image , respectively .",
    "one significant consequence of this problem is that it produces degeneracy in determining the lensing parameters of the event ( see   3 ) like the degeneracy problem for a blended event whose light curve results from the combination of @xmath6 and the blended flux .",
    "therefore , it is often believed that the dia method is not as powerful as the classical method based on the psf photometry in determining the einstein time scale @xmath1 of an event .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that the degeneracy problem in microlensing events detectable from the searches by using the dia method will not be as serious as it is often worried about .",
    "this is because a substantial fraction of events will be high amplification events for which the deviations of the amplification curves constructed with the wrong baseline fluxes from their corresponding best - fit standard amplification curves will be considerable even for a small amount of the fractional baseline flux deviation @xmath2 . with a model luminosity function of source stars and under realistic observational conditions , we find that @xmath3 of detectable galactic bulge events are expected to have high amplifications and their baseline fluxes can be determined with uncertainties @xmath4 .",
    "the standard form of the amplification curve of a gravitational microlensing event is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath10^{1/2 } , \\eqno(2.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the lens - source separation normalized in units of the angular einstein ring radius @xmath12 , and the lensing parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represent the impact parameter for the lens - source encounter , the time of maximum amplification , and the einstein ring radius crossing time ( einstein time scale ) , respectively .",
    "once these lensing parameters are determined from the amplification curve , one can obtain information about the lens because the einstein time scale is related to the physical parameters of the lens by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the einstein ring radius , @xmath18 is lens - source transverse speed , @xmath19 is the mass of the lens , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the separations between the observer , lens , and source star .",
    "however , if the baseline source star flux of an event is misestimated by an amount @xmath23 , the resulting amplification curve @xmath24 ( hereafter ` mis - normalized ' amplification curve ) deviates from the true amplification curve @xmath6 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fractional deviation in the determined baseline flux .",
    "represents the blended light fraction , i.e.   @xmath27 , equation ( 2.3 ) describes the observed amplification curve of a microlensing event affected by blended light of an amount @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the amplification curve of a blended event can be regarded as the mis - normalized amplification curve constructed with the baseline flux deviation @xmath29 .",
    "the only difference is that since the blended light should be positive , i.e.  @xmath30 , while the baseline flux deviation can be either negative or positive , blended amplification curves are always underestimated . ]",
    "if the baseline flux is overestimated ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) , the determined amplification is lower than @xmath6 , and vice versa . note that while there is no upper limit for @xmath32 , it should be greater than @xmath33 ( i.e.  @xmath34 ) .",
    "the shape of a microlensing event amplification curve is characterized by its height ( peak amplification ) and the width ( event duration ) , which are parameterized by the impact parameter and the einstein time scale , respectively . since both the height and width of the amplification curve",
    "are changed due to the wrong estimation of the baseline flux , the lensing parameters determined from the mis - normalized amplification curve will differ from the true values .",
    "first , the change in the peak amplification makes the determined impact parameter change into @xmath35^{1/2};\\qquad a_{p}= { a_{p,0}+f\\over 1+f } , \\eqno(2.4)\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the peak amplifications of the true and the mis - normalized amplification curves .",
    "in addition , due to the change in the event duration , the determined einstein time scale differs from the value @xmath15 by @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the maximum allowed impact parameter ( threshold impact parameter ) for a source star to be detected by having a peak amplification higher than a certain threshold minimum value @xmath40 . with the right choice of the baseline flux ,",
    "the required minimum peak amplification and the corresponding maximum impact parameter are @xmath41 and @xmath42 . however , since the detectability will be determined from the mis - normalized amplification curve , the actually applied threshold amplification and the corresponding impact parameter will differ from @xmath43 and @xmath44 by @xmath45 and @xmath46^{1/2 } \\eqno(2.7)\\ ] ] ( han 1999 ) .    in the upper panels of figure 1 , we present four example mis - normalized amplification curves @xmath24 ( solid curves ) which are expected when the baseline flux of the source star for a microlensing event with @xmath47 is determined with the fractional deviations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . by using equations ( 2.4 )  ( 2.7 ) , we compute the lensing parameters of the standard amplification curves which best fit the individual mis - normalized amplification curves , and the resulting amplification curves @xmath50 are presented by dotted lines . in the lower panels , to better show the difference between each pair of curves @xmath24 and @xmath50 , we also present the fractional deviations of the amplification curves @xmath24 from their corresponding best - fit standard amplification curves , i.e.   @xmath51 . from the figure , one finds the following trends .",
    "first , for the same amount of @xmath52 , the fractional deviation @xmath53 is larger when the baseline flux is underestimated ( i.e.  @xmath54 ) compared to the deviation when the baseline flux is overestimated ( i.e.  @xmath30 ) .",
    "second , although the difference between the two amplification curves @xmath24 and @xmath50 becomes bigger as the deviation @xmath2 increases , the mis - normalized amplification curves , in general , are well fit by standard amplification curves with different lensing parameters .",
    "in previous section , we showed that since the amplification curve of a general microlensing event obtained based on wrong estimation of the baseline flux is well fit by a standard amplification curve with different lensing parameters , making it difficult to determine @xmath0 from the shape of the observed light curves . in this section , however , we show that for high amplification events the deviations of the mis - normalized amplification curves from their best - fit standard curves are considerable even for a small fractional deviation @xmath2 , and thus one can determine the baseline fluxes with small uncertainties .    to demonstrate this , in the upper panels of figure 2 , we present the mis - normalized amplification curves constructed with the same fractional baseline flux deviations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the cases in figure 1 , and the corresponding best - fit standard amplification curves for a _ higher",
    "_ amplification event with an impact parameter of @xmath55 . in the lower panels ,",
    "we also present the fractional differences @xmath53 . from the comparison of the fractional differences",
    "@xmath53 in figure 1 and 2 , one finds that the deviations of the mis - normalized amplification curves from their corresponding standard amplification curves are siginificantly larger for the higher amplification event .    to quantify how better one can determine the baseline flux with increasing event amplifications , we determine the uncertainty ranges of @xmath0 for microlensing events with various impact parameters @xmath13 under realistic observational conditions . to do this , for a given event with @xmath13 we first produce a series of mis - normalized amplification curves which are constructed with varying values of @xmath32 . in the next step",
    ", we obtain the best - fit standard amplification curves corresponding to the individual mis - normalized amplification curves by using the relations in equations ( 2.4 )  ( 2.7 ) .",
    "we then statistically compare each pair of the amplification curves @xmath24 and @xmath50 by computing @xmath56 , which are determined by @xmath57 ^ 2 .",
    "\\eqno(3.1)\\ ] ] for the computation of @xmath56 , we assume that the events are observed @xmath58 times during @xmath59 . the photometric uncertainty @xmath60 depends on the observational strategy , instrument , and source star brightness .",
    "therefore , we determine the photometric uncertainty by computing the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath61 ) under the assumption that events are observed with a mean exposure time of @xmath62 by using a 1-m telescope equipped with a detector that can detect 12 photons / s for a @xmath63 star . the detailed description about the signal - to - noise computation is described in   4 .",
    "once the values of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath32 are computed , the uncertainty of @xmath0 is determined at @xmath64 ( i.e.  @xmath65 ) level .",
    "we then repeat the same procedures for events with various values of @xmath13 ( and thus the peak amplifications ) .    in the upper of figure 3",
    ", we present the resulting values of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath66 for example events with the source star brightness @xmath67 and various impact parameters of @xmath68 , 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.22 . in the lower panel ,",
    "we also present the uncertainty range of @xmath2 ( shaded region ) . from the figure ,",
    "one finds the following trends .",
    "first , the uncertainty significantly decreases as the impact parameter decreases , implying that the baseline fluxes for high amplification events can be determined with small uncertainties .",
    "second , if the impact parameter becomes bigger than a certain critical value ( @xmath69 ) , the value of @xmath56 becomes less than 1 , implying that the @xmath0 can not be determined from the shape of the obtained light curve .",
    "for our example events with @xmath67 , this corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "note that the uncertainty range @xmath2 in the lower panel is determined only for impact parameters yielding @xmath71 .",
    "third , the upper limit of the uncertainty range is always bigger than the lower limit .    knowing that @xmath0 can be determined only for high amplification events , we define _ the critical impact parameter _ @xmath69 as the maximum allowed impact parameter below which the baseline flux of the event can be determined with uncertainty less than @xmath72 ( i.e.  @xmath73 and @xmath4 . then @xmath69(@xmath0 )",
    "represents the average probability that the baseline flux of an event with a source star brightness @xmath0 can be determinded with an uncertainty less than 50% .",
    "we compute the critical impact parameters for events expected to be detected towards thd galactic bulge , and they are presented in the upper panel of figure 4 as a function of the source star brightness in @xmath74 band . from the figure , one finds that as the source star becomes fainter , the value of @xmath69 decreases .",
    "this is because for a faint source event , the photometric uncertainty @xmath60 is large . therefore , to be distinguished from standard amplification curves with a statistical confidence level higher than the required level ( i.e. @xmath73 ) , the event should be highly amplified .",
    "in previous section , we showed that the baseline fluxes of high amplification events can be determined with precision . in this section",
    ", we determine the fraction of high amplification events for which one can determine @xmath0 with small uncertainties among the total microlensing events detectable by using the dia method .    under the assumption that image subtraction is perfectly conducted ,",
    "the signal measured from the subtracted image by using the dia technique is proportional to the variation of the source star flux , i.e.  @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "the noise of the source star flux measurements comes from both the lensed source star and blended stars , i.e.  @xmath76 , where @xmath28 is the background flux from blended stars in the effective seeing disk ( i.e.  the undistinguishable separation between images ) with a size ( i.e.  diameter ) @xmath77",
    ". then the signal - to - noise ratio of an event whose light variation is detected by using the dia method is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the mean background flux . for a high amplification event ( @xmath80 ) with a bright source star ( @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio becomes photon limited , i.e.   @xmath82 .",
    "by contrast , for a low amplification event with a faint source star ( @xmath83 ) , the noise from the background flux becomes important .",

    ". the value of @xmath90 is obtained by numerically solving equation ( 4.1 ) with respect to the amplification for a given threshold signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath85 .    in the upper panel of figure 4 ,",
    "we present the maximum impact parameter @xmath92 as a function of the source brightenss for stars in the galactic bulge . for the computation of @xmath84",
    ", we assume the same observational conditions described in   3 .",
    "the adopted threshold signal - to - noise ratio of the macho experiment is @xmath93 ( alcock 1999a , 1999b ) . in our computation , however , a higher value of @xmath94 is adopted to account for the additional noise from the sky brightness and the residual flux due to imperfect image subtraction .",
    "the average background flux is obtained by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the crowding limit of the galactic bulge field and the luminosity function of stars in the field normalized to the area of @xmath98 .",
    "we adopt the luminosity function of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) constructed from the observations of bulge stars by using the _ hubble space telescope _ and the adopted crowding limit is @xmath99 mag .",
    "we assume that an event is detectable if signal - to - noise ratios are higher than @xmath85 during @xmath100 of the source star flux variation measurements . from the figure",
    ", one finds that the detection probabilities ( i.e.  @xmath92 ) of events with source stars faint than the crowding limit , and thus unresolvable , are not negligible up to @xmath101 mag below @xmath96 implying that a substantial fraction of events detectable by using the dia method will be faint source star events ( jeong , park , & han 1999 ) .    with the determined values of @xmath92 as a function of source star brightness , we then construct the effective source star luminosity function by @xmath102 we also construct the luminosity function of source stars for high amplification events with measurable baseline fluxes by @xmath103 once the two luminosity functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are constructed , the fraction of high amplification events out of the total number of detactable events is computed by @xmath106 we find that for @xmath107 of events detectable from the microlensing searches by using the dia method will have high amplification events for which the baseline fluxes can be determined with uncertainties @xmath4 .",
