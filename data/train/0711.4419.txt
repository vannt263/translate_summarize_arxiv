    "recently the ( co)homological properties of the spaces @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) of ( framed ) long knots in @xmath2 are widely studied ; the classical case ( @xmath3 ) by r. budney @xcite , budney and f. cohen @xcite ; the case @xmath4 by d. sinha @xcite , v. turchin @xcite , p. salvatore @xcite , p. lambrechts , turchin and i. voli @xcite , and others .",
    "their approaches in some senses make use of the _ little disks operad _ and its action on @xmath1 , which induces on @xmath5 the _ browder operation _ , a structure of a _ poisson algebra_. this poisson structure has not been well understood , and studied in @xcite , and so on .",
    "there is another geometric approach to @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) .",
    "a. cattaneo , p. cotta - ramusino and r. longoni @xcite constructed a cochain map from certain graph complex to the de rham complex of @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) via perturbative expansion of chern - simons theory , which generalizes the integral expression of the vassiliev invariants for knots in @xmath8 due to r. bott , c. taubes @xcite and independently to t. kohno @xcite .",
    "moreover they proved that the induced map on cohomology is injective on the trivalent graph cocycles .",
    "the injectivity was proved by evaluating the cohomology classes over the cycles obtained from _",
    "chord diagrams_.    almost nothing has been known about the cohomology classes coming from non - trivalent graphs ( in the case of ordinary knots , there is a result of longoni @xcite ; see below ) .",
    "one reason is that we do not know the corresponding homology cycles .    in this paper",
    "we combine the de rham theory for @xmath0 with the action of little disks operad , and obtain the first example of a non - trivalent graph cocycle which realizes a non - zero cohomology class of @xmath0 .    [",
    "main ] suppose @xmath4 is odd",
    ". then the graph cohomology group @xmath9 consisting of trivalent graphs with exactly one four - valent vertex is isomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "its generator @xmath11 gives a non - trivial element @xmath12 via the configuration space integral .",
    "theorem [ main ] is an analogous result to those of @xcite , but the proof is more geometric .",
    "we prove the non - triviality of @xmath13 by evaluating it on a cycle produced by the action of little disks operad on the space @xmath1 , defined in @xcite .",
    "thus we immediately obtain the following .    [ browder_nonzero ] when @xmath4 is odd , the browder operation induced by the operad action on @xmath1 in the sense of @xcite is non - trivial .",
    "the cohomology classes of @xmath0 obtained from trivalent graphs can be seen as `` higher dimensional analogues '' of the finite type invariants for knots in @xmath8 .",
    "but the cohomology class obtained in theorem [ main ] is not such a one .",
    "it would be an interesting problem to which ` invariant ' for knots ( or 3-manifolds ) our class corresponds .",

    "longoni found a non - trivalent graph cocycle ( different from ours ) when @xmath4 is even , and made a non - zero element of @xmath15 from the cocycle .",
    "the proof is also similar to ours , that is , the evaluation of the cocycle on the dual cycle .",
    "but the construction of the cycle naturally differs from ours , since there is no operad action on @xmath14 .",
    "longoni s cycle is `` secondarily '' defined by using 4-term relations , while we use an operad action .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section we recall the action of little disks operad on the space of framed knots , following @xcite , and",
    "construct a cycle on which our cocycle will be evaluated .",
    "the third section is devoted to reviewing the configuration space integral .",
    "the readers familiar with @xcite may skip this section , except for  [ non_trivalent ] . in the last section",

    "its limit is the product of the linking numbers of @xmath271 and @xmath272 ( @xmath41 ) , thus equal to one .",

    "the author has not computed @xmath283 , @xmath289 .",
    "but turchin s computation @xcite of certain spectral sequence related to @xmath224 suggests that @xmath283 might be zero for @xmath289 .",
    "in fact @xmath290 and the euler characteristic of the complex @xmath291 is zero , so @xmath292 .",
    "thus there would be no contradiction even if @xmath293 .",
    "of course it is not difficult to compute @xmath283 , @xmath289 , though it would be exhausting .",

    "recall @xmath295 from  [ action ] .",
    "the following theorem proves our main result .",
    "we name the nine graphs in figure [ cocycle ] @xmath297 respectively ; @xmath298 first we remark the following fact @xcite ; the configuration space integral construction explained in  [ botttaubes ] can be proceeded as long as the volume form of @xmath66 is symmetric , that is , @xmath299 for the antipodal map @xmath300 ( we are assuming @xmath18 is odd ) .",
    "when @xmath301 , the cohomology classes of @xmath0 obtained via the configuration space integrals do not depend on the choice of such symmetric volume forms .",
    "so below we use the symmetric volume form whose support is localized in the ( sufficiently small ) neighborhood of @xmath302 .",
    "let @xmath303 ( @xmath41 ) be the ` sizes ' of resolutions of the self - intersections @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) of the immersion @xmath39 representing @xmath37 ( see   [ cycles ] , [ action ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath304 , @xmath41 ( @xmath49 appears in the description of the resolution , see  [ cycles ] ) .",
    "we will compute the limit @xmath305 of the pairing @xmath296 . the homology class",
    "@xmath306 $ ] is independent of the values @xmath49 , and so is the pairing .",
    "but in the limit , as we will prove later , all the graphs @xmath241 except for @xmath268 do not contribute to @xmath296 ( lemmas [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] ) , and @xmath307 is not zero ( lemmas [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] ) .      as in the computation in ",
    "[ ex_evaluation ] , only the integration over @xmath254 \\setminus c_{\\varepsilon}$ ] contributes to the above pairing in the limit .",
    "so the graphs @xmath241 with less than four interval vertices never contribute to the pairing in the limit @xmath305 .",
    "the graphs @xmath311 and @xmath312 have four vertices on the special line .",
    "so the corresponding points @xmath313 is in @xmath314 \\setminus c_{\\varepsilon}$ ] if and only if @xmath315 , @xmath257 .",
    "then in the case of @xmath311 , the integrand @xmath316 is zero since we take the immersion @xmath39 so that @xmath317 with @xmath318 can not be near @xmath319 , the support of our volume form . in the case of @xmath312 , the integrand @xmath320 also vanishes by similar reason .      the points @xmath322 \\setminus c_{\\varepsilon}$ ] corresponding to interval vertices should be as in the above lemma .",
    "so the integrand @xmath323 vanishes unless the point @xmath324 corresponding to the free vertex @xmath325 is ` near @xmath326 , ' since otherwise the images of @xmath327 , @xmath328 , can not be in the support of @xmath329 simultaneously .",
    "now we look at two maps @xmath327 , @xmath330 . in the limit @xmath331 , the points @xmath332 and @xmath333 are very near ( @xmath334 and the interval @xmath335 have been introduced in remark [ linkingnumber ] ) , and the free point @xmath324 has to be far from them .",
    "so the image of the map @xmath336 is near the diagonal set @xmath337 .",
    "more precisely , for any open neighborhood @xmath338 of @xmath339 , there exists @xmath340 such that the image of @xmath341 is contained in @xmath338 for any @xmath342 .",
    "thus on @xmath314 \\setminus c_{\\varepsilon}$ ] the integrand @xmath343 can be written as @xmath344 for the gauss map @xmath345 and some @xmath346 such that @xmath347 .",
    "hence the integrand is @xmath348 and its integration converges to zero as @xmath331 .",
    "first we prove @xmath350 ; the integrand @xmath320 is not zero only if @xmath351 \\setminus c$ ] is such that @xmath352 is near @xmath353 and @xmath354 is near @xmath355 .",
    "but then no other @xmath356 can be near @xmath357 .",
    "the integrand @xmath361 does not vanish only if the @xmath362 is such that @xmath352 is near @xmath353 , @xmath363 are near @xmath355 , @xmath354 is near @xmath357 and @xmath364 is near @xmath365 .",
    "integration with respect to @xmath366 and @xmath367 is the linking number , and hence equals to one ( remark [ linkingnumber ] ) .",
    "so it remains to compute the integration with respect to @xmath368 and @xmath369 .",
    "we reformulate the situation around @xmath370 as follows ( see figure [ m ] ) ;    * a point @xmath371 ( corresponding to @xmath372 ) is on @xmath373 ( this sphere corresponds to @xmath374 introduced in  [ ex_evaluation ] ) , * two points @xmath375 $ ] ( corresponding to @xmath376 ) are on the @xmath377-axis ( corresponding to the interval @xmath378 ) , and * the frame @xmath379\\in so(n-1)$ ] ( @xmath79\\in \\sigma s^{n-3}$ ] ) acts on @xmath2 , fixing the @xmath138-axis .      if we define @xmath380)\\ ] ] by @xmath381,p_1 , ( p_4 , p_3 ) ) & : = ( \\varphi_{13},\\varphi_{14 } ) ( e[s , u]p_i ) _ { i=1,3,4 } \\\\   & = \\left ( e[s , u ] \\frac{p_1 -p_3}{{\\lvert { p_1 -p_3 } \\rvert}},\\ , e[s , u ] \\frac{p_1 -p_4}{{\\lvert { p_1 -p_4 } \\rvert } } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then our aim is to compute the integral @xmath382 } f^ * ( vol_{(s^{n-1})^2})\\ ] ] where @xmath383 is a top form of @xmath384 ( remember the support of @xmath329 is localized in the neighborhood of @xmath319 ) .    the map @xmath385 has its image in @xmath386 where @xmath138 is the @xmath18-th coordinate of @xmath387 .",
    "in fact , as we will prove in lemma [ 6 ] , the map @xmath385 is two - fold covering on @xmath388 branched on the diagonal @xmath389 , thus the image of @xmath385 covers the half of the support of @xmath390 twice .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath391 with @xmath392 , the map @xmath393 defined by the commutative diagram @xmath394 ^ -{f_*}_-{\\cong } \\ar[rr]^-{g}_-{\\cong } & & t_q n \\ar[ld]^-{\\cong}_-{f _ * } \\\\     & t_{f(p)}(s^{n-1})^2 &   } \\ ] ] is an isomorphism of oriented tangent spaces for suitable orientations of @xmath185 and @xmath384 .",
    "thus the limit of the above integral is @xmath395 .",
    "we denote by @xmath399 the @xmath18-th coordinate of @xmath400 .",
    "we will show that for any @xmath401 ( then @xmath402 ) , we can find @xmath403,p_i ) $ ] so that @xmath404,p_i ) = ( v_3 , v_4 ) $ ] , that is , @xmath405\\frac{p_1 -p_i}{{\\lvert { p_1 -p_i } \\rvert}}=v_i , \\quad i=3,4.\\ ] ] consider the 2-plane @xmath406 spanned by two vectors @xmath407 .",
    "then the intersection @xmath408 is a one - dimensional linear subspace of @xmath409 .",

    "so the frame @xmath413 should transpose @xmath377-axis to @xmath411 .",
    "there are two such frames , namely , @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath414 $ ] for some @xmath79\\in \\sigma s^{n-3}$ ] .",
