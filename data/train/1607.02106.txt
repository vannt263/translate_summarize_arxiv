    "this framework applies to any topological group @xmath4 admitting a _ maximal metric _ , i.e. a compatible right - invariant metric @xmath5 such that , for any other compatible right - invariant metric @xmath6 , the identity map @xmath7 is lipschitz for large distances . up to quasi - isometry ,",
    "such a metric may equivalently be given as the _ word metric _ with respect to a suitable , namely _ relatively ( ob ) _ , generating set for @xmath4 .",
    "provided such a metric exists , it gives @xmath4 a canonical quasi - isometry type , and many of the standard tools of geometric group theory can be adapted to its study .",

    "we show that the group of all lifts to any cover also admits a maximal metric , hence well defined quasi - isometry type , and give conditions on when the group of lifts to the universal cover is quasi - isometric to the product @xmath18 .",

    "in essence , theorem [ section thm ] shows that the large - scale geometry of the fundamental group of a manifold is reflected in the large scale geometry of the group of @xmath24equivariant homeomorphisms of its universal cover .",
    "we illustrate this with several examples .",
    "the main tool in the proof of theorem [ section thm ] is a very general result on existence of bornologous sections for quotients of topological groups .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is a topological group generated by two commuting subgroups @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is coarsely embedded , and the quotient map @xmath27 admits a bornologous section @xmath28 . then @xmath29 is coarsely equivalent to @xmath4 via the map @xmath30    as a consequence , this gives a generalization of , and in fact a new proof of , a theorem of gersten @xcite .",

    "section [ group actions sec ] discusses the dynamics of group actions from the perspective of large scale geometry . while it remains an open problem to find any example of a finitely generated , torsion - free group that does not embed into @xmath1  for any fixed manifold @xmath0 of dimension at least two  restricting to _ quasi - isometric embeddings _ makes the problem significantly more tractable .",
    "thus , we propose the study of quasi - isometric embeddings as new approach to the  @xmath31 zimmer program \" .",
    "as evidence that this approach should be fruitful , we prove the following .",
    "there exists a torsion - free , compactly generated group @xmath4 and manifold @xmath0 , such that @xmath4 embeds continuously in @xmath3 , but @xmath4 does not admit any continuous , quasi - isometric isomorphic embedding in @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of this theorem uses _ rotation sets _ as a way to link the dynamics of group actions with the geometry of the group .",
    "although the group @xmath4 constructed in the proof is not very complicated , it does contain a copy of @xmath32 .",
    "it would be very interesting to see a discrete example in its place .",
    "as is well - known , every topological group @xmath4 has a natural right - invariant uniform structure , which by a characterization of a. weil is that induced by the family of all continuous right - invariant _ carts _ @xmath5 on @xmath4 , i.e. , metrics except that we may have @xmath33 for @xmath34 . in the same way",
    ", we may equip @xmath4 with a canonical right - invariant coarse structure . here a _ coarse space _ ( in the sense of @xcite ) is a set @xmath35 equipped with a family @xmath36 of subsets @xmath37 ( called _ coarse entourages _ ) that is closed under finite unions , taking subsets , inverses , concatenation as given by @xmath38 , and so that the diagonal @xmath39 belongs to @xmath36 .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is an cart on @xmath35 , the associated coarse structure @xmath40 is that generated by the basic entourages @xmath41 for @xmath42 . thus , if @xmath4 is any topological group , we may define its _ right - invariant coarse structure _ @xmath43 by @xmath44 where the intersection ranges over all continuous right - invariant carts @xmath5 on @xmath4 .    associated with the coarse structure @xmath43 is the ideal of coarsely bounded subsets .",
    "namely , a subset @xmath45 is said to be _ relatively ( ob ) in @xmath4 _ if @xmath46 for all continuous right - invariant carts @xmath5 on @xmath4 . in the case that @xmath4 is _ polish _ , i.e. , separable and completely metrisable , this is equivalent to the following definition .",

",
    "ob \" here stands for _ orbites bornes _ , referring to the fact that for any continuous isometric action of @xmath4 on a metric space , the orbit of any point under a relatively ( ob ) subset of @xmath4 has finite diameter .    for a polish group @xmath4 ,",
    "having a relatively ( ob ) identity neighbourhood @xmath47 is equivalent to the condition that the coarse structure @xmath43 is given by a single compatible right - invariant metric @xmath5 , in the sense that @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", we say that the metric @xmath5 is _",
    "coarsely proper_. moreover , a compatible right - invariant metric @xmath5 is coarsely proper exactly when the @xmath5-bounded subsets coincide with the relatively ( ob ) sets in @xmath4 . if furthermore @xmath4 is _",
    "( ob ) generated _ , that is generated by a relatively ( ob ) subset @xmath45 , we may define the corresponding right - invariant word metric @xmath53 on @xmath4 by @xmath54 in this case , @xmath4 admits a compatible right - invariant metric @xmath5 that is _ quasi - isometric _ to the word metric @xmath53 , i.e. , so that @xmath55 for some constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "such a metric @xmath5 is said to be _ maximal _ and is , up to quasi - isometry , independent of the choice of @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , @xmath23 can always be taken to be an identity neighbourhood in @xmath4 .",
    "in contradistinction to the case of locally compact groups , many large polish groups happen to have _ property ( ob ) _ , i.e. , are relatively ( ob ) in themselves .",
    "this simply means that they have finite diameter with respect to every compatible right - invariant metric and therefore are quasi - isometric to a point .",
    "this can be seen as a metric generalization of compactness , as , within the class of locally compact second countable groups , this simply characterizes compactness .",
    "once this maximal metric , quasi - isometric to the word metrics @xmath58 of all relatively ( ob ) identity neighbourhoods , is identified , the usual language and toolset of geometric group theory can be applied almost ad verbum , though occasionally additional care is required .",
    "for example , a map @xmath59 between polish groups is _ bornologous _ if , for every coarse entourage @xmath60 on @xmath4 , the subsets @xmath61 give a coarse entourage for @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are coarsely proper metrics on @xmath4 and @xmath26 , this simply means that , for every @xmath42 , there is @xmath64 so that @xmath65    we should note that , in the present paper , we have chosen to work with the right - invariant coarse structure @xmath66 , as opposed to the left - invariant coarse structure @xmath67 defined analogously .",
    "this is due to the fact that the most natural metrics on homeomorphism groups are right - invariant .",
    "( these are the maximal displacement metrics , @xmath68 , defined in the next section . )",
    "moreover , this choice causes little conflict with the framework of @xcite , since the inversion map @xmath69 is an isomorphism of the two coarse structures .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove the following theorem , which is our starting point for the study of the large scale geometry of homeomorphism groups .",
    "[ homeo ob ] let @xmath0 be a compact manifold",
    ". then @xmath1 has the local property ( ob ) , hence a well defined quasi - isometry type .",
    "before we begin the proof , we recall some basic facts on the topology of @xmath3 . if @xmath0 is any compact metrisable space , the _ compact - open topology _ on @xmath1 is given by the subbasic open sets @xmath70 where @xmath71 is compact and @xmath72 open .",
    "this topology is complete and separable , making @xmath3 a polish group .",
    "more generally , if @xmath35 is a locally compact metrizable space and @xmath73 its alexandrov compactification , we can identify @xmath74 with the pointwise stabilizer of the point at infinity @xmath75 inside of @xmath76 .",
    "being a closed subgroup , @xmath74 is itself a polish group in the induced topology , which is that given by subbasic open sets @xmath77 where @xmath78 is closed and @xmath79 open and at least one of @xmath80 and @xmath81 is compact . as shown by r. arens @xcite , when @xmath35 is locally connected , e.g. , a manifold , this agrees with the compact - open topology on @xmath74 .",
    "all other transformation groups encountered here will be given the respective induced topologies .",
    "if @xmath5 is a compatible metric on a compact metrizable space @xmath0 , the compact - open topology on @xmath3 is induced by the right - invariant metric @xmath82 observe that , if instead @xmath5 is a compatible metric on a locally compact metrisable space @xmath35 , the corresponding formula will not , in general , define a metric on @xmath74 , as distances could be infinite .",
    "it will often be useful to work with geodesic metrics and their associated lifts .",
    "let us first recall that , by a result of r. h. bing @xcite , every compact topological manifold @xmath0 admits a compatible geodesic metric , so we lose no generality working with these .",
    "moreover , for every such geodesic metric on @xmath0 and cover @xmath83 , there is a unique compatible geodesic metric @xmath84 on @xmath85 so that the covering map @xmath86 is a local isometry .",
    "see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "this metric @xmath84 will be call the _ geodesic lift _ of @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath83 is the universal cover of a compact manifold @xmath0 and @xmath5 is a compatible geodesic metric on @xmath0 with geodesic lift @xmath84 , then the action @xmath87 by deck transformations preserves the metric @xmath84 . as",
