    "it is natural to expect that the discrepancy comes from the fact that the anticanonical divisor on @xmath16 is no longer nef for @xmath37 .",

    "however , we have observed that @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath42 of the indecomposible summands of @xmath32 .",

    "this includes a framework for homological mirror symmetry for cases where the anticanonical divisor is not ample , nor even nef .    indeed , in @xcite , the authors demonstrated that any ( straight line ) run of the toric mori program degenerates the mirror so that critical points can be arranged into successive annuli .",

    "this condition is also often called weak fano , usually with the additional assumption that the singularities are canonical .",

    "this allows us to view the mirror to any @xmath46 as a landau - ginzburg model coming from a neighborhood of some collection of critical points in the mirror to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore we propose that , like the homological mirror to @xmath16 , the homological mirror of any projective toric dm stack @xmath46 can be realized as a regeneration of the degenerated landau - ginzburg mirror of @xmath66 ( in the sense of @xcite ) .    with this picture in mind",

    "fang , liu , treumann , and zaslow proved a very similar statement via different means in @xcite . a natural question to ask ,",
    "given the results of @xcite and @xcite , is : for a non - nef fano projective toric dm stack @xmath46 , how does one naturally determine the subcategory of the fukaya - seidal category of the hori - vafa mirror which corresponds to the derived category of @xmath46 ?",
    "this paper proposes that following the toric mori program through mirror symmetry gives the answer .    in the case of picard",
