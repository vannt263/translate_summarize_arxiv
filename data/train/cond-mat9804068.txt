    "<S> we report an anomalous doublet structure and low - energy satellite in the magneto - photoluminescence spectra of a two - dimensional electron system . </S>",
    "<S> the doublet structure moves to higher energy with increasing magnetic field and is most prominent at odd filling factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower - energy satellite peak tunes to _ lower _ energy for _ increasing _ magnetic fields between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these features occur at energies below the fundamental band of recombination originating from the lowest landau level and display striking magnetic field and temperature dependence that indicates a many - body origin . </S>",
    "<S> drawing on a recent theoretical description of hawrylak and potemski , we show that distinct mechanisms are responsible for each feature .    over the last decade </S>",
    "<S> a substantial body of work has focused on the investigation of the photoluminescence spectra originating from the recombination of a two - dimensional electron system with a valence - band hole in the quantum hall regime . in conjunction with transport measurements , </S>",
    "<S> much of this work has concentrated on examining the nature of the incompressible ground states that arise at integral and fractional filling.@xcite more recently , optical techniques have proven sensitive to excited states of the 2deg inaccessible to transport . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two groups have recently reported on new low - energy structure in the magneto - photoluminescence in gaas structures occurring at energies below the fundamental recombination from the lowest landau level ( lll).@xcite while clearly indicative of many - body effects , these new experimental results have led to differing proposals for the mechanisms responsible for the various spectral anomalies and a consensus has yet to be reached . </S>",
    "<S> these features have alternatively been attributed to a perturbative many - body shake - up process@xcite and to a non - perturbative final state resonance of the 2deg.@xcite it is the purpose of this paper to present the results of a comprehensive experimental study of the polarization , magnetic field and temperature dependence of these optical anomalies and elucidate the distinct mechanisms responsible for each .    </S>",
    "<S> we report on the observation of unusual low - energy structure in the magneto - photoluminescence spectra for filling factors @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify and analyze two distinct features : ( i ) a doublet structure in the fundamental recombination from the lowest landau level develops at odd integral filling factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 , ( ii ) a significantly smaller satellite peak which red shifts for increasing magnetic field between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is observed at approximately 2mev below the doublet structure . while these features are separated by rather small energy differences and occur roughly in the same regime of magnetic field , we shall show that the data conclusively point to distinct mechanisms for each process .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional electron system under investigation is a single - side @xmath5-modulation doped al@xmath6ga@xmath7as - gaas 250@xmath8 single quantum well ( sqw ) . </S>",
    "<S> samples from three different wafers have been studied with similar behavior seen in all samples . </S>",
    "<S> all three samples are of extremely high quality : electronic densities n@xmath9 range from @xmath10 and mobilities @xmath11 range from @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were excited at 740 nm with the output of a tunable ti : sapphire laser . </S>",
    "<S> the laser was stabilized and the incident power density was kept below @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that all measurements were made in the linear regime by collecting data with incident power densities at @xmath14 with no change in the observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> excitation delivery and signal collection were accomplished via an optical fiber system that resides in he@xmath15 refrigerator mounted in a 13 t magnet . </S>",
    "<S> base temperature of our configuration is 500mk . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were made in the transmission geometry and polarization analysis is done _ in situ _ with a circular polarizer placed immediately following the sample but prior to the collection fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the signal is dispersed in a 0.64 m monochromator and detected with a liquid nitrogen - cooled charged - coupled - device ( ccd ) camera with 0.2mev resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 displays the low temperature magneto - photoluminescence spectra in the left - circular ( @xmath16 ) polarization in the field range of 0 t to 4 t for a sample with n@xmath9=@xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the use of polarization analysis is crucial since the high quality of these samples results in narrow line - widths in which spin - splittings are resolved above 1.5 t . detecting in the @xmath16 polarization guarantees that the fundamental recombination from the lll occurs between a @xmath19 electron level and a @xmath20 hole level . </S>",
    "<S> the application of a quantizing magnetic field causes the zero field spectrum to split into the landau fan structure . </S>",
    "<S> the gross behavior of these spectra and its relationship to the quantum hall effect have been studied extensively.@xcite we focus our discussion on the low energy structure between @xmath0 and @xmath3 appearing below the main peak labeled ll@xmath21 in figure 2 . within the context of a non - interacting model , ll@xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> is associated with the ground - state recombination of an electron and hole , each sitting on the lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows an individual spectra taken at @xmath1 and t=0.53k in which two distinct low - energy features are visible below the fundamental ground - state recombination ll@xmath21 . our analysis will focus on the origin of these two optical anomalies , labeled oa@xmath21 and oa@xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin our discussion with the lowest energy feature , labeled oa@xmath22 , which we attribute to the process of shake - up in a magnetic field . in a shake - up process a recombining electron - hole pair perturbs the electron gas causing another electron to be excited across the cyclotron gap from the lowest landau level to the first landau level . </S>",
    "<S> energy conservation requires that the emitted photon s energy be lower than the fundamental recombination by @xmath23 @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> shake - up in a magnetic field has been studied experimentally with similar behavior reported in ingaas - inp quantum wells@xcite , and most recently , in gaas structures.@xcite the theory of shake - up has also been extensively investigated.@xcite most theoretical approaches have assumed a significant amount of disorder in which electron - electron interactions can be treated perturbatively and only cyclotron gaps are considered . </S>",
    "<S> zeeman gaps , which are typically unresolved in such systems , are ignored , and consequentially the shake - up process is independent of the spin configuration of the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure 3 , oa@xmath22 moves to lower energy for increasing magnetic fields with a slope approximately equal to -1.65mev / t , corresponding to an inter - landau level excitation in gaas.@xcite we note that the absolute separation between oa@xmath22 and ll@xmath21 is actually greater than @xmath24 : at @xmath1 the recombinations are separated by @xmath23 6mev while @xmath24 at this field is approximately 4mev . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior has been observed previously in the ingaas - inp system@xcite and attributed to the fact that for non - zero wave - vectors the excitation energy of the n=1 magneto - plasmon mode actually exceeds @xmath24.@xcite for comparison , we have drawn in figure 3 a line through oa@xmath22 that corresponds to an excitation dispersing with a slope equal to the ideal ( non - interacting ) landau level separation in gaas of 1.65mev / t . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence is quite good . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of oa@xmath22 is also quite small ; its peak intensity is only @xmath25 of the peak intensity seen in ll@xmath21 , and between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , oa@xmath22 shows very little intensity variation . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the observed intensity in oa@xmath22 and its complete lack of significant variation over this field range clearly identify it as a perturbative shake - up process .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to oa@xmath21 , the largest and most striking feature in figure 2 . at @xmath1 oa@xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> contains nearly 50 percent of the spectral weight seen in the fundamental recombination band , ll@xmath21 . the intensity of oa@xmath21 exhibits complicated magnetic field dependence which is clearly seen in figure 4 . at @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> there is no indication of the oa@xmath21 but at @xmath0 it is clearly developed . </S>",
    "<S> this change happens quite dramatically ; the feature appears with a change of magnetic field of only 0.1 t . </S>",
    "<S> the feature does nt disappear at @xmath26 but rather its intensity is suppressed relative to @xmath0 and it _ blueshifts _ towards ll@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> oa@xmath21 rapidly gains spectral weight at @xmath1 , again in a very narrow regime of magnetic field of approximately 0.1 t . for higher magnetic fields the feature </S>",
    "<S> is greatly suppressed and largely gone at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is summarized in figure 3 where the magnetic field dependence of all recombinations is displayed . </S>",
    "<S> oa@xmath21 does not move to lower energy for increasing field as one would expect from a simple shake - up process : it shows very little dispersion except for blueshifts seen at @xmath26 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of this novel structure is also quite telling and is displayed in figure 5 . </S>",
    "<S> oa@xmath21 , which appears as broad shoulder to the ll@xmath21 recombination at t=4.2k , does nt change significantly down to temperatures of 2k . </S>",
    "<S> the most dramatic changes occur between 1.5k and 0.53k . </S>",
    "<S> this energy scale of 1k @xmath23 0.08mev is much smaller than any cyclotron gap and indicates the importance of many - body and/or spin effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the most striking aspects of oa@xmath21 are its huge intensity at odd filling factor @xmath1 and the complex dependence of its intensity and energy position on magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the strong resonance seen at odd filling suggests that the spin of the electron system plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> our understanding of this doublet structure follows the recently developed model of hawrylak _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite which has been used to explain a similar behavior seen in the data of gravier and co - workers.@xcite this model has the advantage that it is applicable in the limit of low disorder in which both zeeman and cyclotron gaps are resolved and electron - electron interactions are expected to be of prime importance . </S>",
    "<S> the recombination of a conduction - band electron and valence - band hole leaves a hole in the final state of the electron system . in the non - interacting limit </S>",
    "<S> this hole represents a well - defined quasiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this hole left behind in the final state of the 2deg lies well below the fermi level and constitutes a highly excited state . </S>",
    "<S> if this hole is degenerate with other elementary excitations of the electron gas and electron - electron interactions are strong , the spectral function of the fully interacting hole may not be perturbatively related to the hole in the non - interacting system . </S>",
    "<S> this is the fundamental finding of hawrylak s work : the doublet structure observed in luminescence at odd filling factors is due to the non - quasiparticle behavior of the 2deg hole spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> the two peaks observed in luminescence are shown to be due to a resonant many - body interaction of the hole in the electron gas with a continuum of spin - wave excitations . </S>",
    "<S> thus spin plays a crucial role in the physics of this model ; the splitting of the spectral function only occurs at odd fillings where a continuum of low - lying spin waves is resonant and the spin of the hole can be compensated for by a spin - flip excitation . </S>",
    "<S> hawrylak has deemed this situation an `` anderson - fano '' resonance in which the hole strongly interacting with the continuum of low - lying spin waves is mapped onto the classic solid - state physics problem of a localized state interacting with an unbound continuum .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that such theoretical considerations describe qualitatively our experimental observations of the doublet ll@xmath21 and oa@xmath21 , and clearly distinguish it from the perturbative shake - up process oa@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the hole spectral function has been calculated numerically@xcite and the lower energy peak of the doublet is found to contain 60 percent of the spectral weight of the fundamental recombination band at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this splitting into a resonant doublet structure is consistent with the experimentally observed behavior . </S>",
    "<S> additionally this theory accounts well for the observed blueshifts and intensity reductions seen in oa@xmath21 at even filling @xmath26 and @xmath3 where the spectral function is expected to collapse to a single peak in the absence of low - lying intra - landau level spin wave excitations . </S>",
    "<S> both experiment and theory point to the important role played by the spin magnetization of 2deg for final state interactions .    in summary , we have presented a systematic experimental study of the low energy structure of the photoluminescence spectra from a low disorder 2deg at integral filling @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our findings identify two distinct features occurring below the fundamental band of recombination from the lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy satellite is consistent with a perturbative shake - up process in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the fundamental recombination line at odd filling factors is shown to be related to a non - perturbative splitting of the final state spectral function of the 2deg . </S>"
