    "for instance , @xcite decomposed the disc of the milky way into mono - abundance populations ( in the [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plane ) , but any evolutionary interpretation must rely on a relation between abundances and age .",
    "simulations by @xcite showed that mono - abundance and mono - age populations are roughly equivalent .",
    "this equivalence still must be tested from an observational point of view , even though it has often been demonstrated that the large majority of @xmath0-rich stars are indeed older than 89 gyr ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a major difficulty arises from the fact that stellar ages must be indirectly inferred , contrary to stellar masses and radii , that can be measured for stars in binary systems , or using interferometry .",

    "these oscillation modes are regularly spaced in frequency , and can be described by two global asteroseismic parameters , @xmath3and @xmath4 . scaling relations connect these two seismic parameters to stellar mass , radius and effective temperature ( see section [ sec : kepler ] for a description of these scaling relations ) .",
    "it is either possible to directly use scaling relations to determine stellar masses @xcite , or to combine seismic information with theoretical isochrones to help lift some of the degeneracies we mentioned earlier ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the goal of this paper is to study the relation between age and chemical abundance for a sample of red giant stars that have been observed both by _ kepler _ ( and thus have seismic parameters measured ) and by apogee ( @xmath5and chemical abundances are obtained from high - resolution near - infrared spectra ) . to derive ages",
    ", we use a simple technique that provides an upper limit on stellar ages , in a robust manner that minimizes as much as possible the effects of model - dependence that are characteristic of grid - based modelling .",
    "we first determine a minimum mass for each star using the seismic scaling relations , then translate that minimum mass into a maximum age , which is insensitive to the evolutionary stage of each star .",

    "this offset is manifest in the left panel of figure [ fig : hr ] , which presents a comparison of seismic log(@xmath10 ) and dr10 @xmath5for a sample of apokasc metal - poor stars ( @xmath19 [ m / h ] @xmath20 ) along a set of corresponding parsec v1.1 isochrones @xcite that have [ m / h ] @xmath21 and ages from 1.5 to 12 gyr .",

    "the data span a range of metallicity from -0.5 to -0.3 . while the models are for a metallicity of -0.4 and are shown for ages from 1.5 to 12 gyr .",
    "there is a systematic offset between data and theoretical isochrones for dr10 that is greatly reduced for dr12.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    systematic offsets in effective temperature may arise both from the data and the models .",
    "for instance , it is known that temperatures derived from spectroscopy can be up to a few 100 k lower than temperatures computed from colours @xcite .",
    "temperatures derived using the infrared flux method for a sample of stars overlapping with the apokasc sample by @xcite as part of the saga survey ( strmgren survey for asteroseismology and galactic archaeology ) are 90 @xmath23 k higher than the dr10 @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that dr12 @xmath5measurements are closer to the isochrones is reassuring , but the isochrone temperatures themselves could be affected by systematic uncertainties . indeed , the temperature on the red giant branch ( rgb ) in stellar models depends on many factors , including the treatment of convection , the atmospheric boundary conditions , the low - temperature opacities , and the equation of state ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , convection is typically modelled within the framework of the mixing - length theory . in this theory ,",
    "convection is described by a single number , the mixing length parameter , @xmath24 , which is used to compute the typical distance an eddy can travel before losing its identity . in standard sets of isochrones , including the parsec ones , @xmath24 is fixed at a single value for all stellar models , and is calibrated such that the solar models reproduce observed properties of the sun .",
    "however , the temperature on the rgb is highly sensitive to @xmath24 , and both 3d stellar atmosphere calculations @xcite and calibrations on observations @xcite show that @xmath24 varies with temperature , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "small changes in @xmath24 could easily shift the temperature of the rgb by a few .",
    "finally , @xmath5is also affected by chemical abundances : on the rgb , @xmath5decreases for a lower fraction of helium and for a higher fraction in @xmath0-elements , in particular mg and si @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "matching model isochrones of the rgb to data is highly non - trivial .    after exploring these issues",
    ", we decided against using standard grid - based modelling techniques to compute ages , as we remained concerned that they may yield spurious ages because of the @xmath5offsets .",
    "instead , we adopt a simple approach that does not rely on precise comparisons with isochrones , which should be quite robust against @xmath5calibration issues .",
    "it simply consists in obtaining masses from the standard seismic scaling relations , then translating these masses into ages using simple relations between stellar mass , metallicity and total lifetime , i.e. , maximum age .",
    "our aim is to provide strong and reliable constraints on the maximum age of each star .",
    "this approach also relies on the idea that masses and main - sequence lifetimes are more robustly understood than rgb temperatures .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , a change of @xmath24 from 1.94 to 1.64 , which would change @xmath5by several 100s k , only increases the stellar lifetime by 1% .",
    "the standard seismic scaling relations , equations 1 and 2 , can be combined to derive the mass of a star as : @xmath25 we adopt @xmath26 k , @xmath27hz , @xmath28hz . the solar values @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ones used to build the apokasc catalogue and were obtained by @xcite with the oct method .",
    "we derive the mass uncertainty from the uncertainties on @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 , which have average values of 3.1% , 2.4% and 1.9% , respectively ; this leads to an average mass uncertainty of 0.19 m@xmath31(or 14% ) . the uncertainties on @xmath3and @xmath4are the main contributors to the error budget compared to uncertainties on @xmath5because of the higher exponent for these quantities in equation [ eq : mass ] .",
    "temperature uncertainties are negligible here , except in the case of systematic offsets as discussed in the previous section .",
    "an increase of @xmath5by 100 k for all stars ( see figure [ fig : hr ] ) would increase the masses by up to 0.1 m@xmath31 .",
    "as we would like to provide an upper limit on stellar ages , we use the `` minimum mass '' of each star , defined as the 1@xmath32 lower limit on the mass , which translates into a `` maximum age '' , defined as the corresponding 1@xmath32 upper limit on the age .",
    "figure [ fig : mcumul ] displays the cumulative distribution of these minimum masses for stars in different bins of [ @xmath0/m ] . as expected , the distribution is skewed to higher masses for stars with lower [ @xmath0/m]compared to @xmath0-rich stars , indicating that @xmath0-poor stars are on average younger than @xmath0-old stars .",
    "there are , however , a few @xmath0-rich stars ( [ @xmath0/m]@xmath1 ) with relatively high masses . as discussed in the next section , a minimum mass of 1.2 m@xmath31corresponds to a maximum age of @xmath33 7.5 gyr .",
    "figure [ fig : mcumul ] implies that amongst the 241 stars with [ @xmath0/m]@xmath1 there are 14 stars younger than at least 7.5 gyr .",
    "we define the minimum mass as the lower bound of the 68% confidence interval for each star . a minimum mass of 1.2 m@xmath31translates into a maximum age of 7.5 gyr , whatever the metallicity . out of 241 stars with ,",
    "14 are younger than 7.5 gyr.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    these seemingly remarkable stars constitute a small fraction of the overall sample and have mass uncertainties that are significant . therefore , we must check whether their low estimates for the maximum age do not simply constitute the tail of the error distribution , with the true population of @xmath0-rich stars being all old .",
    "to that aim , we select 241 mock giant stars from a set of parsec isochrones without mass loss on the rgb ( in order to maximize stellar mass at a given age ) , with metallicities from @xmath34 to 0.1 , and ages uniformly distributed between 9 and 12.5 gyr , which would be ages typically expected for @xmath0-rich stars . we add errors to the masses by drawing randomly from the observed distribution of relative mass uncertainties ( @xmath35m / m ) , and compute the number of stars in that mock sample that would be wrongly identified as massive and young .",
    "we draw 1000 different such samples of 241 stars .",
    "we find that each sample contains on average @xmath36 stars with wrongly inferred minimum masses above 1.2 m@xmath31 . only in 2% of cases",
    "does the sample contain between 6 and 8 spurious young stars , and never more than 8 .",
    "this result demonstrates that finding 14 young stars among 241 is inconsistent with a distribution of uniformly old stars given the observed mass uncertainties",
    ". only a small fraction of these 14 stars could plausibly be erroneous inferences of massive stars .",

    "the two mass determinations agree well .",
    "the stars identified as massive and young ( minimum mass @xmath39 m@xmath31 ) using scaling relations also have a high mass according to grid - based models.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the scaling relations directly is not the only way to derive masses for the apokasc sample .",
    "the apokasc catalogue contains values of masses and their associated uncertainties obtained from grid - based modelling .",
    "grid - based modelling uses the seismic parameters combined with temperature and metallicity , and compares them to a grid of stellar models to derive the likelihood , or the posterior probability , of masses and ages . in the apokasc catalogue ,",
    "six different pipelines have been used to compute masses @xcite ; their outputs have been combined as described in @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : comp_grid ] presents a comparison of the mass derived from grid - based modelling as a function of the mass obtained using only the scaling relation . except for low - mass stars ,",
    "the two mass determinations agree well .",
    "the small systematic bias is due to the use of dr12 @xmath5 in the scaling relations versus dr10 for the grid - based masses .",
    "compared to dr10 , effective temperatures are on average higher by 50 k in dr12 , and can be up to 150 k higher .",
    "this offset produces slightly increased masses for dr12-based determinations : the slight systematic bias seen in figure [ fig : comp_grid ] disappears if dr10 @xmath5values are used to derive masses from the scaling relations .",
    "the red dots on this figure represent the @xmath0-rich stars ; those with a minimum mass greater than 1.2 m@xmath31according to scaling relations ( the red stars ) would also be classified that way from grid - based modelling . for these stars ,",
    "the two mass determinations are in excellent agreement .",
    "an often - cited advantage of grid - based modelling is that the returned masses as a function of temperature , metallicity , and seismic parameters are consistent with stellar evolutionary models . by using only the scaling relation , all combinations of temperatures , radii , and masses are in principle possible .",
    "this means that the uncertainty on mass is reduced with grid - based modelling @xcite , although @xcite show that the difference between techniques is less strong for red giants compared to main - sequence or sub - giants stars .",
    "we verify this conclusion here : the average uncertainty on mass is 11.6% with grid - based modelling , and 13.9% using scaling relations .",
    "since we find no major systematic offset between the two mass determination techniques , for simplicity we choose to use the mass derived directly from the scaling relations , and its larger associated error bars .",

    "these ages vary , because they do not correspond to the initially same star : a star with a mass of 1.2 m@xmath31at the tip of the rgb actually started its evolution more massive , and is hence younger than a star with a similar mass at the base of the rgb .",
    "for the three models with @xmath42 tested here , the highest possible ages for a 1.2 m@xmath31star are found on the rgb ( but not at the tip of the rgb ) , and are of about @xmath33 7 gyr , except for @xmath0-enriched stars that could be 1 gyr younger .    in the following , for a given mass and metallicity , we adopt as the maximum age the age on the agb based on parsec models without mass loss . this is a less realistic model for stellar evolution compared to models including mass loss , but provides a more robust upper limit on ages ( as seen in figure [ fig : stages ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : age_mass ] demonstrates how this maximum age depends on mass and metallicity .",
    "the series of dots correspond to parsec isochrones for a range of metallicities representative of the apokasc sample , while the solid lines are the basti maximal ages for two extreme metallicities ( @xmath44 and @xmath50 , roughly corresponding to the minimum and maximum values shown for parsec ) .",

    "the dashed , dotted , and dash - dotted lines correspond to various basti models including mass loss that yield smaller ages than the standard case without mass loss .",
    "because the age  mass relation becomes extremely steep for low masses , age determinations are difficult for these stars : a small error on mass or metallicity creates large variations in age .",

    ", we determine a maximum age based on each star s minimum mass and metallicity by using the parsec isochrones with no mass loss ( the dots in figure [ fig : age_mass ] ) . instead of using the actual metallicity of each star , we use bins of 0.2 dex in metallicity as shown in figure [ fig : age_mass ] . in neighbouring bins ,",
    "the change of age at a fixed mass is of the order of a few 100 myr at most , thus potential small errors on the apogee metallicities have little influences on our results .",
    "the @xmath0-enriched models produce consistently younger ages , so that by not considering such models , we provide a conservative upper limit on ages .      ) for stars with a mass of 1.2 m@xmath31and metallicities from -0.5 to 0.3 ( representative of the range of metallicities for the young @xmath0-rich stars in our sample ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to helium fractions for which @xmath52 ( these are values of @xmath46 lower than what is usually found ) , while the diamonds represent the values adopted for the parsec isochrones ( @xmath53),scaledwidth=50.0% ]    despite our efforts to arrive at an upper age limit that is robust against model uncertainties , there remains an additional uncertainty due to the unknown helium content of the stars .",
    "direct measurements of the abundance in helium are limited to stars with @xmath5greater than 8000 k for which strong helium lines are present @xcite .",
    "the mass fraction in helium , @xmath46 , is , however , a critical parameter for stellar models because it has a strong influence on stellar ages . for a fixed stellar mass and metallicity ,",
    "stars enriched in helium have a shorter lifetime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stellar evolution models usually assume that @xmath46 varies as a function of @xmath43 following a simple linear relation : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the primordial helium fraction ( @xmath56 is adopted by @xcite ) , and @xmath57 is calibrated to reproduce the sun s helium abundance . from combinations of observations and theory , @xmath57 is usually found to be between 1 and 2.5 @xcite , while values up to 10 are sometimes proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in any case",
    ", it is unclear if @xmath46=f(@xmath43 ) should be a simple linear relation , or could have more complex behaviours .",
    "for instance , @xcite argue for an increased y for @xmath0-rich stars in the bulge .",
    "to study the effect of a varying helium fraction on our stellar ages , we use the simple fitting formula provided by @xcite to express stellar mass as a function of metallicity , initial helium abundance , and age upon reaching the rgb : @xmath58 -0.276\\   \\mathrm{log } \\left ( \\frac{t}{10 \\mathrm{gyr}}\\right ) \\\\ -0.937 ( y-0.27)\\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : helium ] shows the age upon reaching the rgb as a function of @xmath46 for stars with a mass of 1.2 m@xmath31and metallicities from -0.5 to 0.3 , representative of the range of [ m / h ] for the young @xmath0-rich stars in our sample .",
    "this figure highlights the strong impact the @xmath46 could have on age .",
    "however , for stars of 1.2 m@xmath31 , ages greater than 8 gyr are only possible for stars with super - solar metallicities and unusually low helium fractions .",
    "these stars would correspond to @xmath59 , disfavoured by most studies . for stars with sub - solar metallicities , even a helium fraction as low as",
    "the primordial value still produces ages lower than 7 gyr .",
    "finally , for stars with a mass of 1.4 m@xmath31(not shown in the figure ) and a sub - solar metallicity , ages are always lower than 4 gyr , even with a primordial helium fraction .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we thus have additional evidence for correctly inferred high masses for some of the @xmath0-rich stars in our sample .",
    "the next critical step is the translation of mass to age .",
    "we have shown that our maximal ages are quite robust versus changes of stellar evolution model ( see figure [ fig : stages ] ) , or versus changes in the helium content of the stars ( figure [ fig : helium ] ) .",
    "a remaining issue is the question whether a significant fraction of the apparently young , @xmath0-rich stars are massive because they accreted mass from a binary companion or are the result from a stellar merger . in this case , their current mass would not reflect their evolutionary state and their age .",
    "such over - massive red giants in binary systems have for instance been discovered in the open cluster ngc  6819 @xcite .",
    "stars that accrete mass from a companion or that result from a merger appear as blue stragglers when they are on the main sequence .",
    "they are easily detected in globular clusters , where they appear bluer than the main sequence turn - off .",
    "evolved blue stragglers are more challenging to identify , they are slightly bluer than normal stars on the rgb , and 0.2 to 1 magnitude brighter on the horizontal branch ( hb ) @xcite .",
    "what matters for our study is the fraction of @xmath0-rich stars that could be evolved blue stragglers .    a hubble space telescope study of the populations of blue stragglers , hb and rgb stars in globular clusters by @xcite shows that the fraction of blue stragglers relative to hb and rgb stars varies from 5 to 15% .",
    "the relative abundance of evolved blue stragglers compared to `` normal '' blue stragglers is about 1 to 10 @xcite .",
    "this means that the fraction of evolved blue stragglers to giant stars is of the order of 0.5 to 1.5% .",
    "for the 241 @xmath0-rich stars in our apokasc sample , we could then expect 14 evolved blue stragglers ( using the frequency of blue stragglers observed in globular clusters ) .",
    "another useful estimate is provided by the _",
    "study by @xcite of 115 red giants in the three open clusters , ngc 6791 , ngc 6811 , and ngc 6819 . amongst these 115 rgb stars",
    "( in very similar environments to our @xmath0-rich stars ) , they find two over - massive stars , that they argue are evolved blue stragglers .",
    "if we extrapolate this to our apokasc sample , we could expect about twice as many , i.e. four in total , evolved blue stragglers .",
    "we have limited the contamination of our sample by such stars as we have removed all stars with anomalous surface rotation as identified by @xcite .",
    "in addition , none of the 14 stars display any peculiar behavior in their _ kepler _ light curve ; following @xcite and ceillier et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , we were unable to determine any signature of surface rotation on these stars from the _ kepler _ data up to 100 days period .",
    "@xcite have also used the scatter in radial velocity between successive apogee observations of a given star to eliminate binaries ( assuming that binaries are found at @xmath60 km  s@xmath61 ) .",
    "all our @xmath0-rich young stars have a @xmath62 below 0.2 km  s@xmath61from multiple apogee observations , which further reduces their probability of being binary stars .",
    "this does not exclude the presence of a few evolved blue stragglers in our sample , but these stars should be too rare to explain the nature of our 14 over - massive stars .        finally , another line of evidence supporting the young nature of some of our stars is their location in the h ",
    "r diagram ( see figure [ fig : hr_rich ] ) . because of @xmath5uncertainties , it is difficult to assess the age of stars on the rgb or agb through comparisons with isochrones . for clump stars , however , there is a dependence of log(@xmath10 ) on age . at fixed metallicity ,",
    "young ( massive ) clump stars have a higher log ( @xmath10 ) than older stars ( as seen from the @xmath0-enhanced basti isochrones plotted in figure [ fig : hr_rich_isochrones ] ) . amongst @xmath0-rich stars , those that we identified as young",
    "indeed have a significantly higher log ( @xmath10 ) compared to the  normal  old @xmath0-rich stars , with an offset roughly consistent with ages below 3 gyr . in this figure ,",
    "the @xmath0-rich young star that appears to be a clump star but has a low log ( @xmath10 ) of 2.3 is actually not yet in the clump : it is the star whose period spacing suggests it might be in the subflash phase .",
    "a careful analysis , exploring many potential modelling systematics , has brought us to infer that the apokasc sample contains at least 14 stars that are both enriched in @xmath0-elements and younger than 6 gyr .",
    "our approach is as conservative as possible , so that there might be more young @xmath0-rich stars in the sample , which we have not identified . the ages could be slightly higher if the standard seismic scaling relations would have to be revised , or if the stars s helium content is very low .",
    "none of these options can make the 14 stars older than 89 gyr , which is the age commonly found for @xmath0-rich stars in the milky way ( see for instance the recent results by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such young @xmath0-rich stars are similarly found by anders et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and @xcite in the corot - apogee ( corogee ) sample , with ages determined from grid - based modelling using asteroseismic information .",
    "as described in more detail in @xcite , a few young @xmath0-rich stars are also actually present in the samples described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , using very different age determination techniques , and @xmath0-element abundances from high - resolution optical spectra .",
    "altogether , the combination of evidence from different studies confirms the existence of this population of stars . in corogee",
    ", @xcite find comparatively more @xmath0-rich young stars at small galactocentric radii compared to corot fields in the outer disc .",
    "this result can not be tested with apokasc , where all stars are at a nearly constant galactocentric radius ( see figure [ fig : spatial_dist ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , any radial trend would be difficult to explain if such stars were just an artefact in the data .",
    "this combination of high [ @xmath0/m]and young ages is not predicted by standard chemical evolution models of the galaxy . in the models presented in @xcite ( their figure 2 ) , stars with",
    "[ o / fe]=0.2 are older than 7 gyr , whatever their birth location .",
    "stars with slightly smaller [ o / fe ] can be younger at the condition that they are born in the very outer disk , but they would then have metallicities below @xmath63 , which is lower than what we find .",
    "@xcite suggest that such stars could be born at the end of the bar and then migrate to the solar radius , but it is still unclear if this scenario is a valid one .",
    "one expectation in such a scenario would be that the @xmath0-rich young stars have smaller guiding radii than the rest of the population .",
    "figure [ fig : spatial_dist ] displays the radial velocity and guiding radius distribution for the apokasc sample . the @xmath0-rich and @xmath0-poor stars have clearly different orbital properties , with an average guiding radius of 6.5 kpc for the @xmath0-rich stars versus 7.9 kpc for the @xmath0-poor stars , and average radial velocities of @xmath64 km  s@xmath61versus @xmath65 km  s@xmath61 , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath0-rich young stars do not possess distinct orbital properties compared to the rest of the @xmath0-rich population , with an average guiding radius of 6.7 kpc and an average radial velocity of @xmath66 km  s@xmath61 .",
    "thus , we can not confirm a different birth location for the @xmath0-rich young stars compared to the other @xmath0-rich stars .",
    "more detailed determination of their orbital properties , and comparisons with new galactic chemical evolution models , as well as combined studies with the corogee sample , might shed light on their possible origin .",
    "what appears clear is that , if they are truly young , they can not have formed at the solar radius , and they thus form a sample of stars having experienced radial migration , although from an unknown location . while @xmath0-enrichment correlates quite well with age for the general population , [ @xmath0/m]cannot be used blindly as a proxy for age on a star - by - star basis .",
