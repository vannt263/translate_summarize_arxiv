    "the importance of a resonance can be appreciated remenbering that the standard msw solution to the solar neutrino problem requires values for the mixing angle in vacuum @xmath0 and for the squared mass difference @xmath1 such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 ev@xmath4 @xcite which imply a resonance in the neutrino trajectory inside the sun when the approximately exponentially decreasing standard solar matter distribution is assumed @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called nonadiabatic solution to the solar neutrino problem and the role of the resonance is evident in such situation once that it is well known that the adiabaticity parameter @xcite presents its smallest values in a resonance region , which imply that neutrino transitions are less adiabatic in that region .",

    "it is clear from this figure that the criterion of defining a resonance by means of localizing the maximal mixing angle in matter , which can be safely used in two neutrino conventional msw effect , leads to some ambiguity in the context of three neutrino oscillations and therefore has to be abandoned .    instead",

    "note also that such maximum are not anymore related with values of @xmath119 for flavor coefficients @xmath120 in the way it happened in the conventional msw phenomenon .",

    "a stationary phase is given by the smallest difference of any two diagonal elements of the relevant evolution matrix when one of these elements is time dependent .",
    "as an example , we quote solar neutrinos where the matter density considerably varies along the neutrino trajectory from the center of the sun , where neutrinos are created , to the solar surface .",
    "although in two neutrino oscillations this criterion can be safely used , it does not work anymore in the presently analysed three neutrino msw effect .",

    "transformations on the evolution matrix ( [ eq.6 ] ) it is possible to conciliate resonances and stationary phases .",
    "this is because resonances are invariant under similarity transformations , while stationary phases do not .",
    "therefore the matrix @xmath126 presents a stationary phase for the minimum of @xmath127 coinciding with the minimum of the squared mass difference @xmath128 , and it can be used to calculate the level crossing probability @xcite around the lower resonance . to obtain the correct stationary phase to analyse the higher resonance , we rotate the evolution matrix given in eq .",
