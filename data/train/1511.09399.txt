    "we also use other further developed properties connecting farey fractions with kloosterman sums which have been applied to some useful asymptotics in @xcite , hall @xcite , and in hall and tenenbaum @xcite . with these tools in hand",

    "we will deduce that the joint distribution @xmath36 is piecewise linear for @xmath37 , that is , @xmath38 from a probabilistic point of view , our questions of interest deal with the set @xmath39 , whose average gap size is @xmath40 , for large @xmath6 . in the one dimensional case and a given @xmath41 , what is the probability that a randomly selected gap will be greater than @xmath41 times the average gap ?",

    "we answer the two questions posed above by giving the cumulative distribution function for the @xmath5-dimensional and 2-dimensional case .",
    "one would expect that in the @xmath28-dimensional case the events are not independent .",
    "this is made evident by the fact that @xmath44 is not the product of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( by theorem [ dgapthm1 ] and ) .",

    "the third section of the paper is devoted to some lemmas that allow us to write a sum over farey fractions in a given region as an integral that is easier to handle .",
    "the main ingredients of these lemmas are kloosterman sums . in the third section",
    "we write @xmath45 as a suitable sum for which we can apply the lemmas from the third section . after some other miscellaneous work we complete the proof of theorem [ dgapthm1 ] .",

    "for example , @xmath54 also , in this case the permutation @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56    [ lemma1 ] for an irrational @xmath1 , the lengths of three gaps ( @xmath47,@xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) generated by the sequence @xmath57 may be computed as follows : let us arrange the farey fractions @xmath58 in order on the interval @xmath3 $ ] and choose consecutive fractions @xmath59 and @xmath60 so that @xmath61 then , the three gaps that can appear have lengths @xmath62 and the function @xmath55 , which is a permutation of the set @xmath63 so that the sequence @xmath64 is in increasing order , satisfies : @xmath65    [ numbers ] this lemma gives a simple formula for the number of gaps of each size .",
    "the number of @xmath47 gaps of each size is number of integers in the intervals on the right hand side of the recurrence relation for @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the numbers of @xmath47 gaps , @xmath48 gaps and @xmath49 gaps are , respectively , @xmath67 this is in agreement with the fact that the total number of gaps is @xmath6 and the total length of these gaps are @xmath5 since @xmath68 this last equality is equivalent to the determinant property of farey fractions : @xmath69 indeed , this property may be viewed as a corollary of lemma [ lemma1 ]    in @xcite obryant developed a detailed account of permutations that order fractional parts . here",
    "we have used an independent and simple idea to describe this permutations @xmath66 .",
    "let us define a shifting operation that will associate each gap in the sequence with the two gaps that have @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) as an end point or with the sum of these two gaps .",
    "let the @xmath47 gap be the first gap , that is , the one with @xmath4 as a left end point , and let the @xmath48 gap be the last gap , that is , the gap with @xmath5 as a right end point .",
    "suppose that when the points @xmath11 for @xmath70 are arranged in order , @xmath71 and @xmath72 appear consecutively so that the interval @xmath73 $ ] is a gap .",
    "if either @xmath74 or @xmath75 are @xmath4 then the gap is already the @xmath47 gap or the @xmath48 gap .",
    "if neither @xmath74 nor @xmath75 is @xmath4 , the gap @xmath73 $ ] has the same length as the interval @xmath76 $ ] ( if @xmath77 , we consider this interval as wrapping around through @xmath4 ) .",
    "this interval is also a gap except in exactly one case : the case when the point @xmath78 lies in the gap @xmath73 $ ] . in this case",
    "the gap @xmath79 $ ] is associated with the two smaller gaps @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "this proves that when an arbitrary starting gap is chosen , the shifting process will divide the starting gap into two smaller gaps at most once and that these smaller gaps will have the same size as the @xmath47 gap or the @xmath48 gap since this is where the shifting process terminates .",
    "we now know that the size of the @xmath47 gap is @xmath82 and the size of the @xmath48 gap is @xmath83 we need to show that the minimum and maximum are attained at @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are as in the statement of the lemma .",
    "suppose there is another @xmath88 with @xmath89 and write @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath91 since @xmath59 is the greatest farey fraction less than @xmath1 , we have @xmath92 in the case @xmath93 , we have the trivial inequality @xmath94 from which deduce that , since @xmath59 is the greatest farey fraction less than @xmath1 , @xmath95 which contradicts . in the case",
    "@xmath96 , we have the similar inequality @xmath97 from which we deduce that @xmath98 which also contradicts .",
    "this proves that the minimum is attained when @xmath84 .",
    "the fact that the maximum is attained at @xmath85 follows by symmetry since @xmath99 now suppose that @xmath100 is a point of @xmath7 . if @xmath101 , then the @xmath47 gap , which is the interval @xmath102\\text{,}\\ ] ] can be shifted to the interval @xmath103\\text{,}\\ ] ] so that @xmath104 in this case . in the case",
    "@xmath105 , the gap between @xmath66 and @xmath106 is a @xmath48 gap , so @xmath107 in this case .",
    "finally , when @xmath108 , the gap is a @xmath49 gap and so @xmath109 .",
    "we will transform our integral into a sum of integrals over farey arcs in a certain region .",
    "the resulting sum depends only on the denominators of the farey fractions .",
    "this fact is crucial and explains the heuristic reason why the limit approaches the same distribution function in any interval .",
    "we present a general result for any short interval by borrowing lemma 8 from @xcite .",
    "we have normalized the function and region by a factor of @xmath6 .",

    "we will handle the contribution of the three gaps of each type @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 separately by partitioning the interval @xmath29 $ ] into farey arcs with denominators strictly less than @xmath6 .",

    "if a new integration variable @xmath122 defined by @xmath123 is introduced , the integral becomes @xmath124 to compute the total contribution of the @xmath47 gaps to the function @xmath125 we need to sum this expression over consecutive pairs of farey fractions in the interval @xmath29 $ ] as @xmath126 by lemma [ lemma2 ] , this sum converges to the integrals @xmath127 which further equals @xmath128 and this is the contribution of the @xmath47 gaps to the function @xmath125 .",

    "becomes @xmath133 where the numerators @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the farey fractions have conveniently canceled out .",
    "if @xmath136 , this last integral has the evaluation @xmath137 while if @xmath138 , the substitution @xmath139 shows that the integral has the same evaluation with @xmath86 and @xmath87 switched : @xmath140 thus , the total contribution of the @xmath49 gaps in the interval @xmath141 $ ] is @xmath142 by lemma [ lemma2 ] , the first of these sums approaches the integrals @xmath143 and the second sum approaches the same set of integrals after the change of variable @xmath144 is made .",
    "now , these integrals can also be evaluated with the dilogarithm , and the result is the expression    @xmath145    for the contribution of the first sum to the function @xmath125 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 is the twice the sum of and . since @xmath146 it is now straightforward to calculate @xmath147 and verify that it is differentiable everywhere , that is , the following integral representation is valid : @xmath148 where @xmath149",

    "two key properties were used : the fact that the number of gaps of each of the three sizes is a simple function of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , and the fact that all of the numerators of the farey fraction canceled out of the final calculations .",
    "the exact same phenomenon happens in the general case for the function @xmath118 .",
