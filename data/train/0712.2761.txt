    "however , the appearance of the singularities in the quark fluctuations and specific heat comes from the thermodynamic relations which connect the pressure derivatives with different charge susceptibilities .",
    "thus , divergent properties of charge susceptibilities and the specific heat in the presence of spinodal instabilities are quite general , being independent on the specific formulation of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "this is also the case for the fluctuation critical exponents at the spinodals and their relation to the critical properties at tcp and cep that should be valid for all qcd like chiral models under mean field approximation .",
    "it is a further challenge to verify the influence of the quantum and thermal fluctuations on the critical medium properties in the presence of spinodal phase separation .",
