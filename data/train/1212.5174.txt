    "the fundamental understanding of the drastic slowing down of a super - cooled liquid s dynamics and the eventual formation of a glass remains an open question after decades of research .",
    "one of the challenges is finding and understanding the universal features of glassy systems related to the dramatic increase of the relaxation time @xmath4 ( or viscosity @xmath11 ) as the liquid is cooled .",
    "this challenge is complicated by the observation that several dynamic regimes exist .",
    "the dynamic regimes are usually identified by examining the temperature dependence of the relaxation time @xmath4 or the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 as a function of temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the validity of different theories , and the range at which these theories are applicable , are often tested through the fitting of @xmath4 to the predictions of the theories .",
    "the mode - coupling theory of gtze and collaborators @xcite in its original form predicted that upon supercooling the relaxation time diverges as a power law at the so - called mode - coupling temperature @xmath0 , @xmath13 . while it was quickly recognized that a true power - law divergence is absent , for many liquids",
    "there is a temperature range where a power law fits the temperature dependence of the relaxation time very well over about three decades of the change of the relaxation time @xcite . for lower temperatures and longer relaxation times deviations from the power - law divergence",
    "are found in both experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "these deviations are usually interpreted as the signature of a new relaxation mechanism involving activated dynamics @xcite .",
    "several interesting observations have been made about liquids dynamics within the temperature range where mode - coupling like power law fits work well .",
    "this temperature range , which we will call hereafter the mode - coupling regime , is well accessible to simulational studies @xcite .",
    "we note that many phenomena occurring in this temperature range have been interpreted using the so - called potential energy landscape @xcite .",
    "thus , this temperature region is also referred to as the landscape influenced regime @xcite . at present , the significance of the fact that the simulational results can be interpreted or rationalized in terms of two rather different theoretical scenarios is unclear .",
    "one observation is the emergence of dynamic heterogeneities upon approaching the mode - coupling temperature , and this feature has been extensively studied in simulations @xcite .",
    "briefly , there are subsets of particles that move either much faster or much slower than would be expected on the basis of a gaussian distribution of particles displacements . moreover , these subsets form clusters and the average size of these cluster increases upon supercooling .",
    "extensive work has been done to determine quantitatively the characteristic size of dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "one way to approach this problem is to analyze the so - called four - point structure factor @xcite , which is the structure factor calculated using the initial positions of the particles that have moved less than a certain distance during a specified time period ( as discussed later , the distance is typically a fraction of the particle diameter and the time is often the relaxation time ) .",
    "an analysis of this structure factor results in a dynamic correlation length @xmath14 , which we will refer to as the four - point dynamic correlation length .",
    "the length @xmath14 is found to increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "thus , the increase of the dynamic correlation length correlates with the increase in the relaxation time .",
    "it was found @xcite , that large systems need to be simulated for many relaxation times for an accurate determination of @xmath14 .",
    "the large computational effort required to perform such studies resulted in that the size of dynamic heterogeneities was mostly examined above the mode - coupling temperature .",
    "another interesting observation is the violation of the stokes - einstein relation @xcite . for a liquid in its stable thermodynamic state",
    "it is generally found that the stokes - einstein relation holds and thus the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the relaxation time , @xmath6 .",
    "for strongly supercooled liquids this relationship breaks down and is often replaced by the so - called fractional stokes - einstein relation , @xmath7 with @xmath15 .",
    "the stokes - einstein relation violation is often rationalized in terms of the emergence of dynamic heterogeneities @xcite .",
    "recent simulations also suggest that there is some sort of dynamical crossover between the onset of supercooling and the mode - coupling temperature .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported interesting changes in the dependence of the relaxation time on system size for a variety of systems , including a binary harmonic - sphere mixture , at temperatures around and above @xmath0 .",
    "they argued that these changes can be rationalized within the theoretical framework of the random first order theory ( which is usually assumed to include the mode - coupling theory ) @xcite .",
    "the latter approach allows for the competition between mode - coupling and activated dynamics .",
    "et al . _  argued that these dynamics are impacted by the finite system size in different ways and this results in the change in the finite size effects in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "the results of the finite size effects study were foreshadowed by an earlier dynamic correlation length study of the same binary harmonic - sphere mixture .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite froze a set of particles randomly selected out of an equilibrium configuration to form a stationary wall , and examined the dynamics of the particles that were still allowed to move as a function of the distance @xmath16 perpendicular to the wall . by analyzing the @xmath16 dependence of the relaxation time",
    ", they extracted a dynamic correlation length @xmath17 . if we need to distinguish @xmath17 from other dynamic lengths we will refer to it as the point - to - set dynamic correlation length .",
    "_   found that this length initially increased , but then decreased around @xmath0 .",
    "initially it was believed that the decrease of @xmath17 indicated a decrease in the characteristic size of dynamic heterogeneities . however , by using a direct method to calculate a dynamic length scale @xmath14 , which , as discussed above , is associated with the size of dynamic heterogeneities , we showed that dynamic heterogeneities continue to grow below @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we observed , however , that there is a change in the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath14 within the mode - coupling regime . upon supercooling @xmath9 , but a crossover to @xmath10 was found at a temperature slightly above @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we provide some details of calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and we thoroughly examine the arguments for the change in the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath14 .",
    "the latter crossover remained hidden in previous simulations of a hard - sphere liquid @xcite due to the somewhat narrower range of @xmath4 and @xmath14 accessible in those simulations .",
    "however , the crossover becomes apparent after examining the relationship between the relaxation time and the characteristic size and strength of dynamic heterogeneities combined with the analysis of the stokes - einstein relation violation .",

    "while this identification is relatively straightforward , we found that there is some freedom and therefore some ambiguity regarding the identification of the mode - coupling temperature .",

    "the overlap function and the self - intermediate scattering function encode similar information about the dynamics of our system .",

    "in addition , as discussed in the next section , we quantify dynamic heterogeneities in terms of correlations of the microscopic overlap function pertaining to individual particles . for these reasons , we define the relaxation time in terms of the overlap function . specifically , the @xmath3-relaxation time @xmath4 is the time at which the overlap function decays to @xmath63 , @xmath64 .    shown in fig .",
