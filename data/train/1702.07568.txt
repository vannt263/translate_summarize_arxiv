    "topological insulators ( tis ) are systems which are insulators in the bulk , but their conducting properties are associated with surface ( in 3-dimensional case ) electronic states emerging in the gap  @xcite .",
    "the unique electric and magnetic properties of tis are related mainly to robustness of the energy spectrum of surface electronic states to any perturbation which does not break the time inversion symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this means that nonmagnetic impurities or defects do not open energy gap in the dirac spectrum of the surface electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of magnetic field or a nonzero magnetization at the surface can be crucial as they break the symmetry protection mechanism of the topological insulator  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the magnetization oriented perpendicularly to the surface of a ti opens an energy gap  @xcite , whereas the gap is absent in the case of in - plane magnetization .",
    "this behavior gives a chance to control the parameters of electron energy spectrum by variation of the magnetization orientation , that can be done , for instance , by applying a weak external magnetic field .",
    "another important property of surface electrons described by the dirac hamiltonian is the total transparency of any potential barrier for electrons incident on the barrier  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the klein effect . however , formation of an energy gap in the dirac spectrum significantly changes the situation .",
    "this is because electrons can propagate only _ via _ continuous energy spectrum , and are reflected from the gap .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility of using a structure with a local magnetization region on top of a ti to control transport of surface electrons .",
    "it is important that electron transport in a ti means transport of charge and spin since the electron states are spin - polarized along the direction of electron motion .",
    "it should be noted that structures of this type attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite due to the possibility of an effective control of magnetization in the magnetic layer by the electric current in ti .",
    "it is related to the current - generated spin torque reversing the magnetic moments in the layer .",
    "especially important is the spin - orbit component of the torque @xcite which is due to the current - induced spin polarization of electrons under spin - orbit interaction in the ti .",
    "the other interesting types of a hybrid structure , which includes superconducting and magnetic layers on top of the topological insulator , have been also considered @xcite . in this case , one appear the majorana excitations , which can be manipulated by the magnetization direction @xcite , or a possibility of controlling the phase shift in the josephson current by the in - plane magnetic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we mostly concentrate on charge and spin transmission through the magnetized region assuming that the electric current is weak enough , so that the magnetic moments in the ribbon can be viewed as frozen .",
    "we consider the model with perpendicular magnetization . in this case",
    "the magnetization opens a gap in the electronic spectrum of ti , which creates an effective barrier for the motion of spin - polarized elecrons in ti .",
    "thus , by controlling the magnetization orientation one can change the resistance of the structure @xcite .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator and a narrow thin - film magnetic ribbon on top of its surface .",
    "magnetization in the ribbon is assumed to be perpendicular to the surface of ti , as shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "hamiltonian which describes electrons at the surface of ti can be written in the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the spin pauli matrices , while @xmath2 leads to the energy gap that is determined by the @xmath3-component of magnetization @xmath4 .",

    "is perpendicular to the surface of ti.,width=321 ]    without any magnetic film at the surface , @xmath7 , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) describes massless two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac electrons at the surface of ti .",
    "the energy spectrum of such electrons has two branches , @xmath8 .",
    "the main properties of 3d tis are related to the fact that the low - energy electron excitations are described by massless dirac electrons , and the spectrum is protected by the time - reversal symmetry of the system , so that any perturbation which does not break this symmetry can not open an energy gap in the dirac spectrum @xcite . as we can see from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , dirac electrons are spin - polarized along the wavevector @xmath9 , so the electric charge transmitted by dirac electron is accompanied by the transmission of spin oriented in the direction of electron motion .",
    "one can check that any potential barrier can not stop the motion of massless dirac electrons ( klein paradox @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetization perpendicular to the ti surface can open the energy gap since the magnetization breaks the time - reversal invariance . as a result ,",
    "electrons in ti can be effectively scattered and reflected from the barrier .",
    "we assume that the magnetic region of length @xmath10 is along the @xmath11-axis as shown in fig",
    "correspondingly , we can assume @xmath12 in the following form : @xmath13 the schrdinger equation , @xmath14 , for the spinor components @xmath15,@xmath16 of the wavefunction @xmath17 can be presented as @xmath18 since we assumed the gap in the form given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , these equations can be solved separately in the regions i , ii and iii ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "let us consider first the motion of electrons along the axis @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath19 in equations ( 3 ) . by solving these equations in the regions i ( @xmath20 ) , ii ( @xmath21 ) and iii ( @xmath22 ) we find ( similar formulae are presented by yokoyama @xcite for a different choice of the hamiltonian describing bi@xmath23se@xmath24 ti ) @xmath25",

    "the transmitted ( outgoing ) electron ( 6 ) is spin polarized along the axis @xmath11 .    matching the solutions ( 4)-(6 ) at the interfaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40",

    "these oscillations are due to the interference of transmitted and reflected waves in the magnetized region .",
    "if @xmath47 is not very close to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is integer ) , then we obtain @xmath50 but at the points @xmath51 we get @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath33 , for @xmath36 and small enough @xmath53 we also obtain full transparency of the magnetic barrier , @xmath54 .",
    "it should be also mentioned that when @xmath50 , the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) do not vanish , which indicates that an electron coming from the region i can partially penetrate into the region ii , but it does not go through the outer interface @xmath38 . in the case of large electron energy , @xmath55 , we find from eq .",

    "5 . like the electrical conductance",
    ", the thermoelectric coefficient @xmath110 reveals some oscillations with increasing magnetic region length @xmath10 . as we see",
    ", the dependence of @xmath110 on @xmath10 is very similar to the dependence of conductance @xmath111 because in both cases the main effect is mostly related to the dependence of transmission coefficion on the length @xmath10 .",
    "the standard model of @xmath112 topological insulator uses the following hamiltonian ( without magnetization term ) @xmath113 which differs from the dirac model in eq .",
    ". however , by using unitary transformation @xmath114 the dirac hamiltonian @xmath115 transforms into ( 20 ) .",
    "it means just a different choice of the phase in basis functions in `` different '' models .",
    "the corresponding transformation of pauli matrices is @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the dirac model with magnetization ( 1 ) describes the bi@xmath23te@xmath24 ti with magnetization along the same axis @xmath3 .",
    "the spin polarization of electrons along the direction of motion ( helicity ) in the dirac model corresponds to the polarization perpendicular to the direction of electron motion in bi@xmath23te@xmath24 ti .",
    "this allows us to use all the results of calculation of transmission of electrons through the magnetized region in bi@xmath23te@xmath24 with the standard dirac model ( 1 ) .",
    "the problem of spin torque needs special consideration , which is not in the scope of this paper , and we restrict ourselves by briefly discussing the main points . the total spin transfer torque ( stt ) acting on the moments in the magnetized regions can be calculated as a difference of incoming and outgoing spin currents . since the spin currents in incoming and reflected waves",
    "have the same sign , and there is a relation between reflection @xmath119 and transmission @xmath120 probability , @xmath121 , one can find the following expression for stt @xmath122 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of bi@xmath23te@xmath24 ti the spin polarization of current is along @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the stt component of torque is also along @xmath123 leading to current - induced deviation of magnetic moments from perpendicular .",
    "the maximum of stt is for @xmath124 ( full reflection ) , whereas at a full transparency , @xmath125 , stt is zero .",
    "another component of the torque , namely , the spin - orbit torque ( sot ) is nonzero due to the spin - polarized electrons in ti .",
    "indeed , the nonequilibrium current along axis @xmath11 is associated with the prevailing number of electrons with spin in @xmath123 direction , which results in a nonequilibrium magnetization @xmath126 of the electron gas . in its turn",
    ", it leads to the generation of sot acting at the magnetic moments as @xmath127 , i.e. along @xmath11 .",
    "we calculated the conductance and thermoelectric coefficient of a topological - insulator - based structure consisting of a ti and a thin magnetic ribbon on its surface .",
    "in fact , these parameters characterize transport properties of the region ii since transport in the regions i and iii is purely ballistic .    it should be noted that we did not take into account the possibility of scattering from impurities in the region ii .",
    "in contrast to the transport through regions i and iii , transport in the region ii depends on the presence of potential scatterers , which appears due to the gap .",
    "however , we can neglect this effect as we consider narrow magnetic ribbon , i.e. , when @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the mean free path of electrons in the region @xmath21 .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze the problem of spin transmission through the region under the magnetic ribbon in the dirac model of ti .",
    "generally , the electron spin is not conserved when an electron traverses the magnetic region , contrary to the electric charge which has to be conserved . as we see from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , spin of an electron changes its orientation when it passes through the interface @xmath37 , whereas reflected electrons have spin orientation opposite to the spin of incoming electrons .",
    "thus , the flux of electrons reflected from the interface @xmath37 is associated with the spin current @xmath130 ( spin along @xmath11 ) in the same direction as the spin flux of incoming electrons .",
    "this indicates that the spin current in region i is enhanced with increasing reflection coefficient @xmath131 . in the limit of @xmath132",
    "we get the net spin current generator in the absence of charge current . in turn",
    ", the spin current in the region iii flows in the same direction as the particle ( electron ) flux , which is proportional to the transmission coefficient @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , the spin current passing through the structure is not conserved , due to the spin torque exerted on magnetic moments in the region ii .",
    "the maximum spin torque corresponds to the limit of @xmath134 , i.e. , to the limit of total reflection of electrons .",
