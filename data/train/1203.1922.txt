    "the lower effective temperatures of m stars ( or red dwarfs)which comprise about three - quarters of the stellar population  render the detection of orbiting , close - in , earth - like exoplanets amenable to both the transit and radial velocity techniques @xcite .",
    "the immense interest in hunting for exoplanets around these stars stems from the fact that the habitable zone is located at @xmath00.1 au , rather than @xmath1 au , away from these stars @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the close proximity is that the exoplanets are expected to be tidally locked ( or spin synchronized ) , meaning that they possess permanent dayside and nightside hemispheres .",
    "this expectation has led to theoretical concerns that the atmospheres may undergo collapse , because if heat is not redistributed efficiently from the dayside to the nightside it may lead to the dominant chemical species condensing out on the nightside ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for example , @xcite constructed three - dimensional , general circulation models tailored to the study of gliese 581d and elucidated scenarios for atmospheric stability .",
    "generally , the discovery of close - in super earths ( e.g. , @xcite ) has inspired a number of theoretical studies of their possible atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which either focus on specific case studies or explore a limited range of parameter space .",
    "specifically , we consider an exoplanet possessing a solid surface which is enveloped by a shallow atmosphere .",
    "whether the surface is made of rock , ice , etc , is unimportant , insofar as it provides a solid , lower boundary for the atmosphere .",
    "the atmosphere is assumed to be shallow enough that it may be characterized by advective and radiative time scales which are constant over its entire depth . when the atmosphere is predominantly radiative , heat is thermally re - emitted before it is able to be advected to the permanent nightside .",
    "the nightside becomes arbitrarily cold , .",
    "] thus leading to the condensation of its constituents from the gas to the liquid or solid phases .",
    "when this situation occurs , the atmosphere is unlikely to survive for a duration comparable to the stellar age and we term the atmosphere to have  collapsed \" .",
    "this situation is distinct from the phenomenon of atmospheric escape ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which concerns the ( often slow ) vertical flow of material out of the gravitational potential of the exoplanet .",
    "when the atmosphere is predominantly advective , the efficient redistribution of heat to the nightside provides a necessary but insufficient condition for the nightside atmosphere to exist in its gaseous form  whether it does depends on the thermodynamics of phase changes of the chemical species being considered , which provides the sufficient condition .",
    "if the atmosphere remains in the gas phase , then we term it to be  stable \" .",
    "in other words , an atmosphere which is sufficiently advective _ and _ warm will survive for a long time .    in the present paper ,",
    "the main question we are addressing is : _ what is the simplest model one can construct to broadly understand the stability of super earth atmospheres ? _ to this end , we introduce an analytical framework which allows for an efficient , broad exploration of parameter space , while keeping the number of free parameters involved to a minimum .",
    "the key outcome of our study is the construction of a stability diagram , which allows one to judge if a super earth atmosphere is likely to survive for a duration comparable to the age of its host star . in  [ sect : method ] , we describe our methodology . in  [ sect : stability ] , we present the basic stability diagram as well as variations of it applied to gj 436b and gj 1214b . in  [ sect : discussion ] , we discuss the caveats associated with our model , the implications of our results and also apply our stability diagrams to the _ kepler _ dataset of exoplanets and exoplanetary candidates , as well as 55 cancri e and corot-7b .",
    "to efficiently explore a wide range of parameter space , we construct a 7-parameter model with the following inputs :    1 .   the spatial separation between the exoplanet and its host star ( @xmath2 ) ; 2 .   the radius of the exoplanet ( @xmath3 ) ; 3 .   the bulk mass density of the exoplanet ( @xmath4 ) ; 4 .   the pressure level associated with the infrared photosphere ( @xmath5 ) ; 5 .   the mean molecular weight of atmospheric atoms / molecules ( @xmath6 ) ; 6 .   the number of degrees of freedom of the atmospheric gas ( @xmath7 ) ; 7 .",
    "the bond albedo of the exoplanetary atmosphere ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "if the atmospheric pressure exceeds the saturation pressure , then the molecule ( or atom ) will condense out of the gas phase and into the liquid / solid phase .",
    "the dependence of @xmath49 on the temperature @xmath50 is governed by the clausius - clapeyron equation ( e.g. , ",
    "2.6 of @xcite ) , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the characteristic condensation temperature . depending on whether one is describing the gas - liquid or gas - solid phase change",

    "the top panel of figure [ fig : condensation ] shows the corresponding ( and approximate ) phase diagrams , which include the triple points associated with each species .    our use of the saturation pressure curves is valid as long as one is not above the temperature @xmath59 and the pressure @xmath60 associated with the critical point . in this regime ,",
    "the atmosphere exists as a supercritical fluid where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist .",

    "generally , it becomes less difficult to condense out a given chemical species as the pressure increases .",
    "we assume a thin atmosphere with a bond albedo @xmath8 , such that a fraction @xmath70 of the stellar flux reaches the surface , which resides at a pressure @xmath71 .",
    "the starlight is absorbed and re - emitted in the infrared at a photospheric pressure @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath73 such that we may apply a shallow water model to represent the entire atmosphere between @xmath5 and @xmath71 . the atmosphere is also thin in the sense that the radiative time scale @xmath36 is assumed to be approximately constant throughout , at least near the substellar point .",
    "we regard @xmath5 as a free parameter which characterizes the thickness of the atmosphere .    while we model our atmospheres as consisting purely of molecular hydrogen or nitrogen in our stability diagrams ,",
    "the assumption is that they also contain minor amounts of other chemical species which absorb strongly in the infrared but constitute an insignificant fraction of the total mass of the atmosphere .",
    "this enables us to define a  mean gas \" with a mean molecular weight and to compute quantities such as @xmath74 .",
    "we further assume that these trace constituents are scarce enough that their partial pressures are miniscule , such that they always remain in the gas phase . in this case ,",
    "atmospheric stability is dictated by the main constituent ( i.e. , h@xmath45 or n@xmath45 ) existing in the gaseous regime of the phase diagram .",
    "the typical collisional time between the major and minor constituents of the atmosphere is assumed to be the shortest time scale in the system , such that the atmosphere may be modeled as a single fluid .",
    "we neglect any effects associated with clouds or hazes ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we utilize the linear , analytical , steady - state , two - dimensional version of the shallow water model of @xcite to model the photosphere of a super earth .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "the shallow water system has traditionally been used to model both the terrestrial atmosphere and ocean @xcite , but has been generalized by @xcite to include radiative forcing and drag within the context of spin - synchronized exoplanets .",
    "( see also @xcite and references therein . )",
    "several adjustments are required to mimic the variation of various atmospheric quantities with the strength of stellar irradiation .",
    "firstly , we need to relate the mean shallow water height @xmath75 to a characteristic height in the atmosphere , which we identify as the pressure scale height , @xmath76 secondly , we set the thermal forcing term @xmath77 ( which has physical units of cm s@xmath32 ) to be @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the characteristic time scale used to non - dimensionalize the forcing and @xmath80 , and also adopt a zonal wave number of 0.5 .",
    "in other words , the dimensionless forcing is set to be unity .",
    "the third ingredient is the radiative time scale @xcite , which is the ratio of the thermal energy content per unit area ( @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the column mass in hydrostatic equilibrium ) to the flux @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath83 which enters into the momentum equations via a radiative drag term ( @xmath84 ) .    the fourth  and most uncertain  ingredient is the hydrodynamic drag time scale , which we set to be the rotational / orbital period , @xmath85 on earth , the source of hydrodynamic drag originates from the boundary layer @xcite , which is the transition region from a  no slip \" to a  free slip \" condition between the atmosphere and the terrestrial surface . in the held - suarez benchmark test for earth ,",
    "the time scale for rayleigh drag is set to be one earth day @xcite .",
    "our simple assumption for @xmath86 is plausible and commensurate with the fact that the true source of drag in super earth atmospheres remains to be identified .",

    "shown also are the curves for different values of the mean molecular weight @xmath6 . ]    to assess the efficiency of heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside hemisphere of a tidally - locked super earth , one needs to compare the radiative to the advective time scale @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown using three - dimensional simulations of atmospheric circulation  albeit in the context of hot jupiters  that a reasonable approach to computing the advective time scale is to evaluate @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the zonal wind speed .",
    "while we do not expect the shallow water model of @xcite to reproduce all of the trends obtained from the three - dimensional simulations , we do expect @xmath94 to generally increase with @xmath23 when hydrodynamic drag is insignificant .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : trends ] confirms this expectation for @xmath95 au , a basic trend which is supported by the results obtained from three - dimensional simulations of atmospheric circulation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at @xmath96 au",
    ", the hydrodynamic drag condition we have imposed to mimic the effects of the boundary layer sets in and reverses the trend .",
    "we have checked that if @xmath86 is kept constant ( and at a large value ) , then @xmath94 increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : trends ] , which shows the maximum zonal wind speed normalized by the sound speed , illustrates the effects of hydrodynamic drag more succinctly .",
    "the model also predicts that @xmath94 decreases when the mean molecular weight increases , because a larger value of @xmath6 corresponds to stronger radiative forcing ( i.e. , shorter @xmath36 ) .",
    "such a trend with @xmath6 is consistent with the simulated results of @xcite , who  by examining models for gj 1214b with @xmath97 and 17found that a higher value of @xmath6 leads to a higher ratio of dayside to nightside photospheric flux , implying that heat redistribution becomes less efficient as @xmath6 increases .",
    "we have checked that the qualitative trends in our stability diagrams are similar whether we adopt @xmath98 or as a constant , arbitrary value , although the quantitative results do differ .",
    "three - dimensional numerical solutions of the ( more general ) hydrodynamic primitive equations ( e.g. , @xcite ) predict @xmath992 km s@xmath32 zonal flows , which are mildly supersonic , to be present in hypothetical super earth atmospheres tailored to the study of gj 1214b @xcite .",
    "our estimates for the maximum zonal wind speed are broadly consistent with these calculations .",

    "we assume that the rocky cores of our model super earths do not efficiently conduct enough heat from the irradiated dayside hemisphere to the cold nightside hemisphere to prevent atmospheric collapse .",

    "demanding that the radiative cooling time is less than the thermal conduction time yields the condition @xmath115 the condition in equation ( [ eq : cond ] ) implies that as long as the rocky surfaces of close - in super earths are heated to @xmath116 k , thermal conductivity will not operate rapidly enough to heat the cold nightside hemisphere .",
    "the possibility of significant geothermal heating from the core is not considered in our models and remains a topic for future investigation .",
    "since the atmosphere is predominantly forced by stellar irradiation , the main effect is the competition between advection and radiative cooling .",

    "we have made the assumption that if convective instability is triggered , it leads to the redistribution of heat primarily in the vertical and meridional directions ( and not in the zonal direction ) , which is corroborated by three - dimensional simulations of atmospheric circulation for tidally - locked , earth - like exoplanets @xcite .",

    "inferences about the atmospheric composition of gj 1214b remain controversial @xcite , including the possibility that a reduced value of the radius  which may obtain from an updated estimate of the distance to gj 1214 via improved parallex measurements  is consistent with an atmosphere - less exoplanet .",

    "therefore , an attempt to construct a formation model for super earth atmospheres  which are probably secondary ( i.e. , due to outgassing ) and unlikely to reflect the elemental compositions of the primordial nebulae from which they formed  remains an unconstrained exercise in some instances ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from this perspective , our analytical framework may be regarded as a survival  rather than formation  model , similar to what has been constructed for planetesimal disks @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that when advection is inefficient , the nightside of a tidally - locked super earth becomes arbitrarily cold . in reality",

    "specifically , it is possible for a trickle of heat to maintain an atmosphere if it is hydrogen - dominated even in cases where @xmath117 is unfulfilled .",
    "thus , the @xmath117 curve on the stability diagram should be viewed not as a sharp boundary , but a smooth transition . in general ,",
    "chemical species with very low condensation temperatures probably do not require @xmath117 as a necessary condition for atmospheric stability .",
    "the gaseous state of these chemical species , with low condensation temperatures , may also be maintained by internal heat , which we do not consider .",
    "several other caveats provide motivation for future work .",
    "we have only considered atmospheres consisting of a single chemical species , but this approximation should not be too severe in situations where the given gas ( e.g. , h@xmath45 , n@xmath45 ) is the dominant constituent .",
    "more refined calculations may consider cocktails of greenhouse gases .",
    "another assumption we have made is that our model , rocky exoplanets are not covered by oceans .",
    "oceanic and atmospheric dynamics couple in a non - trivial manner , over a broad range of time scales , with consequences for the heat redistribution between the day- and nightside hemispheres , and are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "our hope is that our simple framework will motivate future work on a broad range of atmospheric constituents and not just earth- or even solar system - centric ones .",
    "more refined trains of thought include the consideration of feedback mechanisms such as the water ice - albedo feedback , which has been shown to operate weakly on tidally - locked exoplanets with earth - like stellar irradiation and atmospheric conditions @xcite .    finally , we compare the present study to previous studies utilizing three - dimensional simulations of atmospheric circulation . for example , the rocky , co@xmath45-dominated super earth model considered by @xcite has @xmath200@xmath201 s , but they do not report their computed zonal wind speeds and thus we are unable to determine @xmath202 . however , we can infer from their figure 1 that even though their model , in 1:1 tidal resonance , appears to have @xmath203 , the nightside temperatures are about 280290 k. these temperatures lie above the condensation temperature of co@xmath45 at 20 bar , which is about 240 k , and thus atmospheric collapse does not occur .",
    "@xcite do not provide the value of @xmath74 used ; if we use @xmath204 erg k@xmath32 g@xmath32 , then we obtain @xmath200 s for their runs with @xmath205 bar . since @xmath206 m s@xmath32 , we have @xmath207@xmath208 s ( @xmath209 ) for their runs with @xmath210 and 13000 km , implying that these model atmospheres are mostly advective , which is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "our basic stability diagram ( figure [ fig : stability1 ] ) demonstrates that there is a maximum exoplanetary radius @xmath184 above which the ( thin ) atmospheres of super earths are unstable . in the left panel of figure [ fig : mstars ]",
    ", we show @xmath184 as a function of @xmath2 across the spectral types m0 to m9 .",
    "the less intensive irradiation from the cooler m stars leads to more lethargic radiative cooling in the atmospheres of their super earths , which increases @xmath184 across all values of @xmath2 .",
    "however , this effect is offset by the center of the habitable zone moving inwards , towards the star , for later spectral types .",
    "the collective result is that @xmath184 is insensitive to the spectral type .",
    "rather , it is somewhat sensitive to the mean molecular weight ( @xmath6 ) and the infrared photospheric pressure ( @xmath5 ) , as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : mstars ] .",
    "atmospheres with lower photospheric pressures and higher mean molecular weights have lower values of @xmath184 , implying that the condition for stability is more stringent . for earth - like atmospheres ( @xmath173 ) and @xmath211 m s@xmath20 , the photospheres of super earths with @xmath21210@xmath213 need to be located at @xmath214 bar for stability .      as a final demonstration of the power of our stability diagram",

    "we include all exoplanets and exoplanet candidates with @xmath215 .",
    "we construct two diagrams for g ( 5200 k @xmath216 k ) and k ( 3700 k @xmath217 k ) stars using the average values of the stellar parameters for each sub - sample .",
    "we adopt @xmath218 gyr for illustration , noting that this only affects the conditions on circularization and spin synchronization . in the absence of empirical constraints",
    ", we adopt solar system - centric values for various parameters ( @xmath219 g @xmath170 , @xmath220 ) , but note that our estimates are insensitive to these assumptions .",
    "a key , unknown parameter is the infrared photospheric pressure . in figure",
    "[ fig : kepler ] , we set @xmath221 bar . with @xmath222 bar ,",
    "almost all of the 1135 _ kepler _ exoplanets and exoplanetary candidates orbiting g stars have stable atmospheres if the atmospheres are dominated by molecular hydrogen ( @xmath37 ) , whereas about 44% of them have stable atmospheres if they are earth - like in composition ( @xmath173 ) . for @xmath223 bar ,",
    "these percentages become about 88% and 1% , respectively .",
    "we include in the stability diagram for g stars the measured @xmath3 and @xmath2 values for 55 cancri e ( @xmath224 , @xmath225 au ; @xcite ) and corot-7b ( @xmath226 , @xmath227 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also highlight the exoplanets kepler-10b ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 au ; @xcite ) and kepler-10c ( @xmath230 , @xmath231 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "it remains possible that 55 cancri e , corot-7b and kepler-10b may maintain minimal atmospheres  which do not extend beyond the day - night terminators and are dynamically dominated by vertical , rather than horizontal , flows ",
    "established through vapour saturation equilibrium with their continuously eroded rocky surfaces @xcite .    for the k stars ( 613 exoplanets and exoplanet candidates ) ,",
    "we obtain similar numbers : for @xmath223 bar , we get 97% ( @xmath37 ) and 4% ( @xmath173 ) ; for @xmath222 bar , we get 100% ( @xmath37 ) and 70% ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "curiously , the exoplanet candidates and exoplanets residing within the habitable zones of both the _ kepler _ g and k stars are likely to possess stable atmospheres , unlike the situation with m stars .    if these exoplanetary atmospheres are earth - like ( @xmath222 bar , @xmath232 ) , then about half of them are expected to be stable .",
    "the continued expansion of the _ kepler _ dataset and the eventual , inexorable pursuit of follow - up observations to further characterize these exoplanets will allow our predictions to be tested .",
    "for example , the photospheric infrared emission from atmosphere - less super earths is likely to be emanated directly from their rocky surfaces , such that the dayside to nightside flux contrast will appear marked ; these exoplanets will also exhibit flat transmission spectra .",
    "the scrutiny of atmosphere - less super earths may provide a survey of their surface compositions @xcite .",
