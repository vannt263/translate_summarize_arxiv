    "shortly after the seminal paper by schrdinger in 1935 @xcite , `` schrdinger cat '' became a pictorial way to refer to a prototypical family of genuinely non - classical states _",
    "i.e. _ , quantum states without a classical counterpart . while the introduction of such states found its original motivation in the analysis of the celebrated cat _",
    "gedankenexperiment _ in quantum measurement theory @xcite , the quantum - mechanical weirdness of schrdinger cat states has since then been widely appreciated in various contexts . the latter range from quantum non - locality @xcite , to non - classical states of light and matter @xcite , and to the emergence of classicality from the quantum world @xcite . in particular , cat states arising from the superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states of a quantum degree of freedom",
    "play a prominent role in the debate on macroscopic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "more recently , the rapid development in the field of quantum information science @xcite has prompted the consideration of various classes of non - classical states from the point of view of the quantum resources that they may involve @xcite .",
    "for instance , cat - like superpositions of bosonic coherent states have been shown to provide robust encodings against amplitude damping @xcite , to carry the potential for improving the sensitivity of weak - force detection @xcite , as well as to exhibit generalized entanglement properties @xcite .",
    "while applications of non - classical states within quantum information processing are still emerging , their association with the field of high precision measurements has a long history .",
    "a leading motivation stems from the need for understanding the ultimate resolution limitations for repeated position measurements in experimental and observational gravitation @xcite . without a careful preparation of the initial state , quantum mechanics",
    "sets a limit based on the assignment of equal uncertainties to position and momentum , resulting in the so - called _ standard quantum limit _",
    "( sql ) @xcite .",
    "attempts to beat the sql have stimulated the development of a theory for quantum non - demolition measurements @xcite , and several experimental proposals aimed at improving the sensitivity of resonant detectors of gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "efforts have primarily focused on a harmonic oscillator @xcite , resulting in the possibility of overcoming the sql using non - classical squeezed states .",
    "the case of a free test mass did not receive much attention until yuen proposed a novel class of so - called _ contractive states _",
    "analogous to the bosonic two - photon coherent states @xcite and capable , in principle , of narrowing the position variance below the sql bound .",
    "while yuen s proposal initiated a controversial debate @xcite , the demand for schemes able to beat the sql for free masses has meanwhile increased due to the amazing improvements in the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometric detectors @xcite . in principle , even a modest gain in the sensitivity obtainable by exploiting non - classical states would imply a relatively large increase in the fiducial volume for gravitational wave detection @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , contractive states as proposed by yuen are difficult to produce in practice ; the only concrete proposal that has appeared so far in the literature was regarding their generation for atomic states @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit schrdinger cat states from the motivating perspective of the sql of a free mass , and show how in addition to their already known properties they are also capable of manifesting contractive features .",
    "the content is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we summarize the basic notions about the contractivity property as introduced by yuen . in section iii",
    "we investigate the behavior of the position variance for a paradigmatic class of schrdinger cat states , evidencing its dependence upon various parameters , and then outlining possible directions for generalization of this result .",
    "section iv is devoted to discussing some implications of the existence of contractive schrdinger cat states , and preliminarily assessing the prospects for demonstrating contractive cat behavior .",
    "additional remarks are presented in the conclusions .",
    "consider a quantum particle of mass @xmath0 freely evolving in one dimension .",
    "if @xmath1 are the position and momentum observables , the equation of motion for @xmath2 in the heisenberg picture is given by @xmath3 let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the variances of the corresponding operators _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the average position and momentum values , respectively . according to eq .",
    "( [ heis ] ) , the position variance after a time @xmath12 can be related to the initial uncertainties @xmath13 and @xmath14 by @xmath15 expressing the fact that the initial position variance increases under free evolution .",
    "the sql for position measurements coincides with the minimum value attainable by @xmath16 in ( [ grow ] ) when @xmath12 is regarded as the time interval between two successive , identical position measurements @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on a heuristic application of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , whereby @xmath17 is interpreted as the uncertainty due to the finite resolution of the first measurement , and @xmath18 represents the momentum disturbance caused by the measurement ( see , however , @xcite for a substantially more refined treatment ) . because @xmath19 , eq . ( [ grow ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath20 which , upon minimization with respect to @xmath21 , implies @xmath22 accordingly , the outcome of the second position measurement can not be predicted with uncertainty smaller than the sql value , @xmath23 .",
    "yuen pointed out a major flaw in the above derivation , as by adding in quadrature the initial position variance and the one propagated in time from the initial momentum variance as in eq .",
    "( [ grow ] ) it is implicitly assumed that position and momentum are initially uncorrelated . while this is correct , for instance , in the common case where the mass starts in a minimum - uncertainty state",
    ", it is necessary in general to relax this assumption , by replacing ( [ grow ] ) with the full expression : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the anti - commutator operation .",
    "thus , the position variance is directly sensitive to the initial _ correlation coefficient _ @xmath26 , with @xmath27 upon explicitly using the canonical commutation rules for @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "yuen also proposed an explicit class of quantum states , the so - called _ twisted coherent states _",
    ", where a _ negative _ correlation term @xmath29 is realized @xcite . as a consequence of the parabolic dependence of @xmath30 upon @xmath12 implied by ( [ parabola ] ) , the initial position variance then narrows , attaining a minimum at an optimal time @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the variance remains below its initial value @xmath21 for the finite time interval @xmath32 , opening the possibility to evade the sql for appropriate values of the parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that the essence of yuen s proposal relies on allowing _ complex _ gaussian states . in one dimension , for instance , consider a wave function of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 . by writing @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the normalization condition leads to @xmath37 ( up to an irrelevant phase factor ) . because for such a state @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , the corresponding correlation coefficient becomes @xmath41 where the parameter @xmath42 can be , in principle , arbitrarily large .",
    "note that the value @xmath43 corresponds to the standard gaussian state , while @xmath44 implies a negative correlation term responsible for the desired non - monotonic behavior of @xmath16 .",
    "following yuen s notation , the prototype wave function ( [ complex ] ) can be generalized to the following family of states : @xmath45 where now @xmath46 , @xmath47 are real numbers , and the parameters @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are related to the initial position and momentum variances and correlation as follows : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 note that @xmath53 ( compare eq .",
    "( [ complex ] ) ) , and the position variance evolves explicitly in time as : @xmath54    motivated by the comparison with the sql , a natural strategy is to optimize the _ relative _ variance obtained upon normalizing @xmath55 by the spreading expected at time @xmath12 for a state evolving at the sql as given in ( [ sqlval ] ) _ i.e. _ , to minimize the quantity @xmath56 by differentiating @xmath57 , we get a minimum relative variance at a time @xmath58 this criterion coincides , for large values of @xmath59 , with the direct optimization of the absolute variance ( [ yuen ] ) originally adopted in @xcite : @xmath60 thanks to the fact that the ratio @xmath61 quickly approaches unity with increasing @xmath59 . the relative criterion ( [ relative ] ) , however , has the advantage of allowing for a continuous comparison with the sql value at a generic instant of time @xmath12 . from equations ( [ yuen ] ) and",
    "( [ optimal ] ) , the minimum relative variance is therefore @xmath62 which quantifies the advantage in the use of a yuen contractive state with respect to one with zero ( or positive ) correlations . as a function of @xmath59 , the ratio in ( [ yratio ] ) is monotonically decreasing in the contractivity region @xmath44 , a unit value corresponding to a classical state with @xmath43 .",
    "while arbitrarily small values can be attained asymptotically , a significant gain already appears for relatively small @xmath59 parameters ; for instance @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "as mentioned , yuen s proposal sparked a lively debate on the meaning and conceptual consistency of the sql for a free mass @xcite , and the discussion still continues @xcite .",
    "while various issues have been substantially elucidated , from an operational perspective limited effort has been devoted to address possible ways for preparing yuen states in the laboratory . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only steps in this direction have been taken by storey and co - workers @xcite , who proposed a position measurement scheme for atoms entering a strongly detuned standing light wave in a cavity , and by vitali _",
    "_ @xcite in the context of stochastic cooling of macroscopic mirrors .",
    "ultimately , one obstacle encountered in designing realizable preparation schemes for yuen states is related to the difficulty of dealing with a complex @xmath65 .",
    "thus , although very interesting in principle , this class of states seems not very palatable to experimentalists , motivating the search for alternative families of contractive states .",
    "following yuen s original suggestion , position - contractive states for a free mass are defined by the property @xmath66 because of the equation of motion ( [ parabola ] ) , @xmath16 increases monotonically with time whenever @xmath67 .",
    "equivalently , in terms of the relative variance @xmath68 , one may verify that if @xmath67 , the inequality @xmath69 for all @xmath12 is also enforced as a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , and vice versa .",
    "in particular , the condition ( [ deriv ] ) is never satisfied by a preparation in a classical gaussian state .",
    "however , yuen s class is not the only family of non - classical gaussian states one may _ a priori _ consider .",
    "another notable class capable , as we shall describe now , of fulfilling ( [ deriv ] ) is provided by _ macroscopically distinguishable _ gaussian states _",
    "i.e. _ , schrdinger cat states in the position variable .",
    "let us consider , to begin with , a two - component schrdinger cat state , namely a coherent superposition of two one - dimensional gaussian wave packets with inverse variance parameter @xmath70 , localized around two positions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and having relative amplitudes @xmath74 : @xmath75+k_{- }   \\exp[-\\alpha(x+x_{0})^{2}]\\right\\ } \\ : .",

    "after straightforward calculations we obtain the initial average values of position , momentum , and their product as follows : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 thus , the correlation coefficient for a mass initially prepared in the state ( [ cat ] ) is : @xmath82 according to ( [ sigmaxp ] ) , two contractivity regions fulfilling ( [ deriv ] ) are then possible in principle : @xmath83    this illustrates a different route for generating a non - zero correlation coefficient compared to yuen states . in the latter case ,",
    "regardless of whether @xmath84 or not , a non - zero correlation @xmath85 arises due to the asymmetric contribution from @xmath86 and @xmath87 , enforcing @xmath88 . for schrdinger cat states of the form ( [ cat ] )",
    ", it is instead the initial anti - correlation between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , that induces contractivity for appropriate @xmath92 and @xmath93 . from a less formal viewpoint , in the case of the yuen states the presence of an imaginary part in the quadratic coefficient @xmath65 effectively correlates the position and momentum observables . for cat states as in ( [ cat ] ) , the correlation is obtained through the _",
    "delocalized spatial structure _ , which can enforce non - zero average values for both @xmath2 and @xmath90 as in ( [ xav])-([pav ] ) .    in order to evaluate the position variance at time @xmath12 based on ( [ parabola ] ) ,",
    "it is necessary to further calculate the second moments @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( see also the appendix ) . for convenience",
    ", we set @xmath96 henceforth , and introduce an adimensional time parameter as @xmath97 it is worth noting that while the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 separately affect the expectations @xmath100 , @xmath101 , the correlation coefficient ( and hence contractivity ) depends only upon their ratio , which we denote by @xmath102 .",
    "we can also assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath103 . by letting @xmath104 , @xmath105 , with @xmath106 and @xmath107 determining the initial relative phase between the two gaussian components , we finally reach the rewritten forms : @xmath108 @xmath109   \\ : .",

    "note that , regardless of possible contractive features , the rate of spreading of @xmath120 may be slower than in the gaussian case due to the interference term contained in @xmath117 . by normalizing @xmath120 to the reference value dictated by the sql , @xmath121 , we obtain : @xmath122 where @xmath123 _ etc_. by minimizing @xmath124 with respect to @xmath114 , an optimal time equal to @xmath125 is found , which is independent of the linear coefficient @xmath126 .",
    "the corresponding minimum value attained by @xmath127 is @xmath128 which can be further optimized with respect to the remaining parameters .",

    "( [ fig5 ] ) , a similar plot depicts the dependences upon @xmath141 and @xmath149 .",
    "the above analysis shows that contractive quantum states , in the original yuen s spirit , can be engineered through an appropriate choice of parameters in the class of cat states described by ( [ cat ] ) .",

    "is it worth noting that not only @xmath203 for @xmath204 , but also the region where values lower than one are achieved appreciably widens for three - component contractive cat states .",
    "for an additional comparison between contractive and non - contractive behavior , it is also instructive to directly examine the time dependence of the absolute variance for representative two- , three - component cat states , and for a gaussian wave - packet with the same width parameter @xmath99 .",
    "the results are shown in figure([fig7 ] ) for maximally contractive cat states .",
    "the monotonic increase of the variance for the gaussian case , @xmath205 is clearly visible . the sql behavior of eq .",
    "( [ sqlval ] ) , which translates into @xmath206 , is reached at time @xmath207 in the non - contractive gaussian case of ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "the contractivity intervals for two- and three - component cat states are determined by the appropriate intersections of the variance curves @xmath127 , @xmath190 with the sql - line .",
    "viewed in this way , the advantage of contractive states also manifests itself in the ability to preserve variances comparable to the initial gaussian value at later times .",
    "in addition , the stronger contractivity of a three - component cat state is evidenced by the higher initial slope , implying both a deeper excursion below the sql value and a longer contractivity interval .",
    "to summarize , the larger set of parameters available in more complex classes of schrdinger cat states is capable of supporting stronger and better contractive properties .",
    "while further investigation is needed to precisely characterize all the possible configurations , the fact that states with increased complexity may allow for a richer `` self - interference '' pattern ( and hereby enhanced contractivity ) is likely to occur beyond the specific case examined here .",
    "in particular , this is also somewhat reminiscent of the recent findings in @xcite , where cat states such as `` compass - like '' superpositions of four gaussians are able to probe sub - planck structures in the phase space .",
    "the existence of contractive cat states immediately evokes , as in yuen s original proposal , the potential for breaching the sql of a free mass .",
    "however , a full assessment of such a potential requires a proper formulation of both the sql itself and of various measurement - theoretical concepts such as quantum precision , resolution , and uncertainty .",
    "while addressing these issues goes beyond the scope of the present work , as far as the implications for the sql are concerned we limit ourselves to a few preparatory remarks .    as emphasized by ozawa @xcite , because the sql applies to _ repeated _ quantum measurements , one essential ingredient is the ability to perform a measurement using a _ single _ measuring apparatus , the reading of which provides accurate information about the position of the free mass and simultaneously prepares it for the next position measurement , leaving it in a contractive state .",
    "a class of measurement schemes well suited for this task is offered by so - called _ gordon - louisell ( gl ) position measurements _ @xcite .",
    "the latter are naturally described within the general formalism of quantum operations @xcite .",
    "let @xmath208 be a real parameter , to be interpreted as the possible outcome of a position readout for a one - dimensional system , and let @xmath209 denote the complete set of position eigenstates .",

    "the distinctive feature of gl position measurement is that , according to ( [ glop ] ) , the posterior state @xmath217 of the system is determined by @xmath218 _ regardless of the prior state",
    "_ @xmath212 , the latter determining the outcome probabilities according to ( [ gleff ] ) . because gl measurements are described by completely - positive quantum maps , every gl measurement is physically realizable in principle @xcite .",
    "gl contractive position measurements were originally invoked by yuen @xcite .",
    "given contractive states of the form ( [ yuenstate ] ) , the relevant family @xmath219 may be constructed by fixing the parameters @xmath220 , and by identifying @xmath221 , for all real @xmath211 .",
    "if we now look , for instance , at two - component cat states as in ( [ cat ] ) , then a contractive state satisfying that @xmath222 can be found except for the ( zero - measure ) set @xmath223 .",
    "let @xmath224 a positive number .",
    "then one may define a family @xmath225 as follows : @xmath226 for fixed @xmath227 , the two corresponding states in ( [ beta ] ) have the same degree of contractivity thanks to the relationship ( [ invar ] ) . by choosing @xmath228 and adjusting @xmath229 in such a way that @xmath230 , contractivity",
    "can then be brought close to optimality .",
    "establishing whether a family of contractive cat states such as ( [ beta ] ) actually supports a well - defined gl position measurement , and whether the latter may succeed in breaking the sql , are interesting problems _ per se _ , which would call for an analysis along the lines of @xcite .",

    "such a constructive problem was solved by ozawa @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the proposed measurement model explicitly requires the initialization of the meter in a contractive state , and contractivity is subsequently transferred to the mass via a controlled interaction . in this context ,",
    "cat states might then turn advantageous if preparation procedures simpler than the ones generating yuen states could be exploited to appropriately initialize the meter .",
    "independently of the sql motivation , the possibility of experimentally demonstrating and characterizing contractive behavior for a free massive particle is both interesting as a fundamental quantum property , and for its possible implications in high - precision _ single _ quantum measurements .",
    "while being certainly challenging with present capabilities , accomplishing this goal could largely benefit from the extensive efforts which are under way to realize schrdinger cat states in diverse physical systems .",
    "starting from the pioneering proposals by yurke and stoler @xcite for the generation of optical cat states , and related following proposals @xcite , such efforts have led to the successful creation and manipulation of macroscopically distinguishable photon states in the cavity qed setting @xcite , and have culminated in the generation of a mesoscopic schrdinger cat for a trapped be ion @xcite .",
    "also , the creation of macroscopically distinguishable states has been recently reported for superconducting circuits @xcite , and proposals for entanglement of trapped electrons have been recently formulated @xcite .",
    "interesting proposals exist for generating schrdinger cat states of mechanical systems via controlled entanglement with microscopic degrees of freedom , including electron pairs in cooper boxes @xcite , single photons in beam - splitter configurations @xcite , as well as radiation - pressure controlled mirrors @xcite . finally , recent advances in ultracold atom physics open new perspectives for the possibility of creating schrdinger cat states with ultracold atomic ensembles or gaseous bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "devices based on trapped ions or cold atoms seem especially promising for demonstrating and exploiting contractivity properties . in this case , if one of the strategies mentioned above actually succeeds for engineering a contractive schrdinger cat state , trapping potentials could be switched off and the mass ( ion or atomic cloud ) be released to free evolution for a given time interval . the position variance could then be inferred from the spatial pattern of the fluorescent light emitted under the action of a light probe beam , and by repeating the experiment for different times of flight the relevant time dependence could be reconstructed .",
    "besides demonstration , contractivity might find useful applications in high - precision atomic physics experiments .",
    "for instance , one possibility worth exploring in principle is trying to improve the accuracy of atomic - fountain clocks through proper refocusing of the atomic cloud on the fluorescence detection area , as this could translate into a decrease of the absolute uncertainty on the atomic populations @xcite . a general observation which may be relevant in this context is that , because the behavior of the position variance would be unchanged for a mass subject to a linear potential , contractive states for a free mass would still exhibit contractivity under a _ uniform gravitational field _ ( see also @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "thus , contractivity could in principle be exploited both in the vertical and horizontal directions .    in spite of these promising avenues ,",
    "a potentially serious concern arises from the fact that schrdinger cat states may be especially fragile against the decoherence effects caused by the coupling to their surrounding environment , a feature which is regarded as crucial to understanding the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite . under the assumption that the environment may be schematized as a harmonic bosonic bath ,",
    "exact analyses are possible by adapting the results available for the quantum brownian motion model @xcite , or by directly resorting to results already obtained for a free damped quantum particle @xcite .",
    "however , it is also worth stressing that the decoherence behavior may be quite sensitive to various details of the system - environment coupling as well as environment properties , and there is hope that on one hand estimates based on general models might be in some cases overly pessimistic @xcite , and on the other hand decoherence effects might be effectively counteracted . in particular ,",
    "stabilization procedure for cat states could be in principle designed based on the basis of both active - control schemes for the system @xcite and symmetrization schemes for the environment @xcite .",
    "we have shown that schrdinger cat states provide a new class of states able to support contractive features in the sense originally proposed by yuen in @xcite .",
    "yuen contractive states lead in principle to an unlimited gain with respect to the sql for a free particle but , apart from a proposal in the atomic physics context @xcite , it is not clear how to prepare such states in practice .",
    "contractive schrdinger cat states , on the other hand , may enable one to capitalize on the intense effort which is ongoing to generate schrdinger cat states with various quantum devices , ranging from trapped ions and atoms to superconducting circuits .",
    "viewed from a broader perspective , our results enforce the conclusions reached in @xcite , where the use of non - classical states and quantum resources of relevance for quantum information processing is also anticipated to improve our capabilities to gather information in high precision measurements . for schrdinger cat states in particular ,",
    "the identification of contractivity features provides independent additional support to the idea that highly delocalized states may develop enhanced quantum sensitivity as recently suggested by zurek @xcite .",
    "while several questions remain to be addressed in more depth , the present analysis thus points to a novel significance and potentially useful applications of schrdinger cat states in the context of quantum - limited measurements .",

    "for completeness , we report the evaluation of the position variance in the schrdinger representation . for two - component schrdinger cat states ,",
    "the starting point is the wave function @xmath232 +            k_- \\exp[-(x+x_{0})^{2}/2\\delta_0 ^ 2]\\right\\ } \\:,\\ ] ] where the normalization constant ( also given in eq .",
