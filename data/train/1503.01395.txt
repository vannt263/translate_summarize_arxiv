    "spin based transport phenomena in graphene is a flourishing area of research due to the expected long spin relaxation lengths resulting from the small spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of carbon atoms and the high carriers mobility . due to these exceptional properties ,",
    "the great potential of graphene for the study of new fundamental phenomena and for applications in nanoelectronics are now extended to the study of spin dependent phenomena with possible applications on spintronics.@xcite in this way the two - dimensional material , with unusual electronic properties , became a model system in which the big challenge is to control and manipulate both , the charge and the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "concerning the spin properties , the actual value of the spin relaxation rate of graphene carriers is still a controversial issue : while the spin relaxation times were initially thought to be very long,@xcite different experiments@xcite suggest that they are much shorter than the theoretical predictions .",
    "this apparent controversy has recently been challenged by the way experiments have been interpreted.@xcite    whatever the source of the spin relaxation mechanism , an important issue for spintronics applications is the ability to control it.@xcite sources of spin relaxation in graphene are usually attributed to magnetic defects ( vacancies@xcite or adatoms@xcite ) , to the presence of extrinsic ( adatom induced ) soc@xcite ripples@xcite or , more recently , to a combined effect of spin - orbit and pseudo - spin physics@xcite .",
    "adatoms , in particular , provide a possible course to engineer spin based effects . the nature of the soc , however , might be different for different adatoms .",
    "very light atoms , like h , which are adsorbed on top of a single c atom and have a small intrinsic atomic soc , introduce soc to the graphene carriers by distorting the otherwise flat graphene sheet@xcite .",
    "this is due to the @xmath1 like structure adopted by the hybridized c atom that induces a local coupling between the carbons @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals . in that case , the effect of the atomic soc of the c atoms changes ( locally ) from being a second order effect to a first order one with the corresponding increase of the effective spin - flip processes in the graphene carriers .",
    "a characteristic of this mechanism is that the resulting soc is proportional to the local lattice distortion.@xcite on the other hand , more heavy atoms can introduce spin effects by processes that involve their own intrinsic soc , i.e. where the spin - flip occurs in the adatoms orbitals and not on the c atoms . in the general case both mechanisms are present .",
    "the fluorine atom on graphene is adsorbed in a top position .",
    "it bounds covalently to the c atom below it ( we will refer to it as the c@xmath4 atom ) , therefore introducing a local distortion in the graphene lattice .",
    "however , owing to its strong electro - negativity , there is a charge transfer from the graphene sheet to the f adatom@xcite .",
    "this charge transfer to the f adatom can be controlled by changing the carriers concentration of graphene .",
    "associated to this , there is a @xmath1-@xmath5 like crossover of the hybridization of the c@xmath4 atom @xcite . since this crossover causes a strong reduction of the lattice distortion , one would expect , as suggested by the scenario described in ref .",
    "[ ] , that the induced soc associated with it will also decrease , thus providing a controllable way to reduce the spin relaxation .    here we show , using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , that , contrary to this expectation , the soc in dilute fluorinated graphene is strongly enhanced by electron doping .",
    "this is due to the fact that the main contribution to the soc comes from the intrinsic soc of the f adatom@xcite and not from the c atoms as the lattice distortion mechanism requires .",
    "this result is validated by a simple tight - binding model , constructed using the wannier functions parameter obtained from the ab initio calculations , which accounts both qualitatively and quantitatively for this effect .",
    "the rest of the work is organized as follows : dft results for the band structure and the projected density of states ( pdos ) for different geometries are presented in sec .",

    "the dft calculations were performed with the quantum espresso package @xcite employing density functional theory and the perdew - burke - ernzerhoff ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional.@xcite an ultra soft description of the ion - electron interaction was used @xcite together with a plane - wave basis set for the electronic wave functions and the charge density , with energy cutoffs of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ry , respectively .",
    "the electronic brillouin zone integration was sampled with an uniform k - point mesh ( @xmath8 ) and a gaussian smearing of @xmath9 ry .",
    "the two - dimensional behavior of graphene was simulated by adding a vacuum region of @xmath10    above it .",
    "all the structures were relaxed using a criteria of forces and stresses on atoms of @xmath9ev /    and @xmath11gpa , respectively .",
    "the convergence tolerance of energy was set to @xmath12 ha ( @xmath13 ha = @xmath14 ev ) . to correct for the dipole moment generated in the cell and to improve convergence with respect to the periodic cell size , monopole and dipole corrections were considered.@xcite",
    "this is particularly important in the doped cases .",
    "doping of the unit cell ( added / removed electrons ) where compensated by an uniformly distributed background charge .",
    "let us first analyze the band structure of fluorinated graphene in the absence of additional doping ( neutral case ) . since we are interested in describing the soc introduced by a single impurity ( corresponding to a diluted fluorinated graphene sample ) , for our dft calculations we use super cells as large as posible ( limited by the computational resources ) .",
    "the use of large super cells is also important in the case of f to avoid long range coulomb interactions among impurities as f adatoms acquire some charge when absorbed on graphene@xcite .",

    "the path in the reciprocal space is labeled using the standard notation for the hexagonal brillouin zone of the supercell lattice .",
    "though negligible on this scale , each band is split in two due to the soc  this is analyzed in detail in the next section . since one would naively expect to observe graphene s dirac cone at the @xmath19 point , it is instructive to mention why that is not the case : our dft supercell contains a single f atom and consequently all impurities in our periodic system are on the same graphene sublattice .",
    "this breaks off the sublattice symmetry and opens a gap in the graphene spectrum.@xcite such gap is proportional to the impurity concentration and hence to the supercell size .",
    "while this effect should not have any relevance for the calculation of local parameters for a large enough supercell , it is important to keep it in mind for a proper interpretation of the results ",
    "the breaking of the sublattice symmetry can be eliminated from the calculations , at the price of increasing the f concentration or increasing the supercell size , by including two f atoms on the supercell , one on each sublattice .    to analyze the character of the bands , it is useful to look at the weight of the corresponding states on the atomic orbitals of each type of atom . that is , to look at the projected density of states ( pdos ) .",

    ", the perturbation potential induced by the adatom @xmath29 , assumed to be local , has the right symmetry as to mix the two non - equivalent graphene s dirac cones .",
    "namely , the fourier transform of the periodic adatom potential contains non - zero components @xmath30 with @xmath31 connecting the two cones .",
    "such admixture leads to a partial decoupling of the graphene @xmath32 band from the adatoms .",
    "this closes the gap induced by the sublattice symmetry break and restores a single dirac cone .",

    "this decoupling , that occurs for a particular geometry , and though rather artificial , will help us to separate different contributions to the so splitting of the bands .",
    "we now turn our attention to the splitting of the bands induced by the soc and , in particular , to the effect of doping on such splitting .",
    "the main contribution to the so splitting in this system arises from the atomic soc of the c and the f atoms .",
    "the contribution from the c atoms is known to be a second order effect in flat graphene own to the reflexion symmetry of the graphene s plane : symmetry prohibit a direct coupling between the @xmath2 and p@xmath34 orbitals of adjacent c atoms  recall that atomic soc mixes @xmath35 orbitals on the same lattice site .",
    "this symmetry is locally broken in the presence of an adatom that sits on top a c atom due to the lattice distortion it introduces .",
    "this was shown@xcite to enhance the soc by breaking the above mentioned selection rule .",
    "the resulting soc is proportional to the distortion of the lattice .",
    "the latter depends , in the case of f adatoms , on the doping level of the graphene sheet due to the charge transfer from the graphene to the f adatom@xcite .",
    "hence , one expects a strong dependence of the c contribution to the so splitting upon doping .",
    "namely , since doping with electrons ( holes ) reduces ( enhances ) the @xmath1 character of the local hybridization of the c@xmath4 atom , we expect this contribution to the so splitting to decrease ( increase ) .",
    "the other source of soc is the adatom itself .",
    "contrary to the case of h , the soc in the f atom is not negligible and must be accounted for .",
    "how this contribution changes with doping , if it does , is however not obvious _ a priori_.    the dft results for the so splitting of three bands for the case of the @xmath36 supercell ( indicated as @xmath37 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in fig .",

    "we must then conclude that the main contribution to the observed splitting is not the atomic so of the c atoms but the one coming from the f adatoms.@xcite to verify this , we repeated our calculation but without including the soc on the f  this is done by using a scalar relativistic pseudo - potential for the f atom as implemented in the quantum espresso code@xcite ) .",

[ ] . however , the origin of its strong dependence on doping is not at all clear . to better understand the underlying microscopic mechanism we now construct a single particle tight - binding model that includes the most relevant orbitals , and later on the atomic soc of f.",
    "namely , we consider a small cluster consisting of one f and four c atoms ( see fig . [ scheme ] ) embedded in graphene .",

    "such comparison , together with the values obtained for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath52 is shown in table [ tabla2 ] .",
    "our results show that , within this model , the main effect of doping on the f s orbitals is to shift their energy up as more electrons are added to the supercell and to slightly change the hybridization parameter @xmath52 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this energy shifting is to be expected from a naive mean field argument as doping induces a charging of the f adatom.@xcite we would like to point out that while with this very simple model one can not expect to fit the value of @xmath86 , the calculated hopping term ( @xmath85 ) is quite reasonable and follow the overall trend with doping  except for the extreme hole doping case .",
    "it is worth noticing that while there is an overall shift of all energies with doping , the important magnitude is their relative shift , which is by far larger in the f atom .",
    "this is the reason for the change of the soc as we discuss below .",

    "the charge transfer from the graphene to the f orbitals has an important effect on the final spin - flip coupling of the graphene carriers .",

    "<S> we analyze the origin of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in fluorinated graphene using density functional theory ( dft ) and a tight - binding model for the relevant orbitals . as it turns out , the dominant source of soc is the atomic spin - orbit of fluorine adatoms and not the impurity induced soc based on the distortion of the graphene plane as in hydrogenated graphene . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , our dft calculations show that soc is strongly affected by both the type and concentrations of the graphene s carriers , being enhanced by electron doping and reduced by hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is due to the charge transfer to the fluorine adatom and the consequent change in the fluorine - carbon bonding . our simple tight - binding model , that includes the soc of the @xmath0 orbitals of f and effective parameters based on maximally localized wannier functions , is able to account for the effect . </S>",
    "<S> the strong enhancement of the soc induced by graphene doping opens the possibility to tune the spin relaxation in this material . </S>"
