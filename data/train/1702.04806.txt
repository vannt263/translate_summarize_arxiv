    "tsallis q - statistical mechanics yielded variegated applications in the last 25 years @xcite .",
    "this statistics is of great importance for astrophysics , in what respects to self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown to be useful in diverse scientific fields .",
    "it has to its credit several thousands of papers and authors @xcite .",
    "investigating its structural characteristics should be important for astronomy , physics , meurology , biology , economic sciences , etc . @xcite .",
    "also , its success reconfirms the notion that a lot of physics has origins of an exclusive statistical nature , not mechanical one .",
    "paradigmatic example is found in its application to high energy physics , where the q - statistics seems to describe well the transverse momentum distributions of different hadrons @xcite . in this work",
    "we use standard mathematical tools described in @xcite to investigate interesting properties of the tsallis statistics of n harmonic oscillators .",
    "the central point is the fact that the integrals used to evaluate the partition function @xmath0 and the mean energy @xmath1 diverge for specific q - values .",
    "these divergences can be overcome as described in @xcite    a basic result to be obtained here is that the number of oscillators , @xmath2 , is strongly limited by the dimensionality @xmath3 and the tsallis parameter q. for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. , the conventional theory , @xmath2 must be finite and bounded . via analytical extension in @xmath3 , we show below that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and n finite and bounded .",
    "thus , systems are bound and self - gravitating @xcite .",
    "finally , we will study the theory s poles by recourse to dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "we find at the poles , that i ) the specific heat @xmath8 is temperature dependent ( classically ! ) , and , ii ) again , gravitational effects .",
    "divergences constitute an important theme of theoretical physics",
    ". the study and elimination of these divergences may be one of the most relevant tasks of theoretical endeavor .",
    "the typical example is the ( thus far failed , alas ) attempt to quantify the gravitational field .",
    "examples of divergences - elimination can be found in references @xcite .",
    "we use here an quite simplified version ( see @xcite ) , of the methodology of @xcite with regards to tsallis statistics @xcite , focusing on its applicability to self - gravitation @xcite .",
    "divergence s removal will be seen to yield quite interesting insights .",
    "these emerge using mathematics well known for the last 40 years ago .",
    "their development allowed m. veltman and g. thooft to be awarded with the nobel prize of physics in 1999 .",
    "comfortable acquaintance with these mathematics is not a prerequisite to follow this paper .",
    "however , one must accept that their physical significance is not now to kin doubt .",
    "in fact , one just needs i ) analytical extensions and ii ) dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "we will here analyze the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in connection with three zones of possible arguments of the @xmath9-function thay appears in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these arguments of the @xmath9-function rule the @xmath0 - @xmath1 behavior , that in turn produces three distinct zones , for a given spatial dimension @xmath3 , tsallis index @xmath10 and number of particles @xmath11 .",
    "the zone s specifics are : + @xmath12 + @xmath13 + @xmath14 + normal behavior is found in zone ( 1 ) .",
    "gravitational effects are encountered in zone ( 2 ) . in zone",
    "( 3 ) we find both normal behavior and also gravitational effects",
    ".    * remark than in instance ( 3 ) we are performing a regularization of the corresponding theory , not a renormalization . *",
    "it has to be noted , from the beginning , that we use in this contribution normal ( linear in the probability ) expectation values .",
    "we do not appeal to the weighted ones , customarily attached to tsallis - related papers @xcite . in this case one",
    "restricts oneself to the interval @xmath15 $ ] , and , consequently , the so - called tsallis cut - off problem @xcite is avoided .    for the q - partition function one has @xmath16^{\\frac { 1}{q-1}}\\otimes\\ ] ] @xmath17 or @xmath18^{\\frac { 1}{q-1}}p^{2\\nu n-1}dp.\\ ] ] we have integrated over the angles and taken @xmath19 .",

    "we briefly recapitulate at this point results previously obtained in ref . @xcite . some related work by livadiotis , mccomas , and obregon ,",
    "should be mentioned @xcite .",
    "we analyze first the gamma functions involved in evaluating @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for the zone @xmath31 $ ] . starting from ( [ eq2.1 ] )",
    "we get , for a positive gamma - argument @xmath32 in analogous fashion we have from ( [ eq2.2 ] ) @xmath33 we are confronted then with two conditions that strictly limit the particle - number @xmath2 , that is , @xmath34 there is a maximum allowable @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 and one can not exceed 332 particles .",
    "our original presentation begins here .",
    "we study first negative gamma arguments in ( [ eq1.4 ] ) .",
    "they will demand analytical extension / dimensional regularization of the integrals ( 1.4 ) and ( 1.8 ) . accordingly ,    @xmath37    together with @xmath38 utilize now @xmath39 to encounter    @xmath40    the above is true if @xmath41 so that @xmath42 where @xmath43 , or equivalently    @xmath44    we note that , from ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , ( [ eq3.2 ] ) , and ( [ eq3.4 ] ) we find ( 1 ) @xmath5 , ( 2 ) @xmath6 , ( 3 ) @xmath7 , which entails bound states , on account of ( 2 ) and self - gravitation according to ( 3 ) @xcite .",
