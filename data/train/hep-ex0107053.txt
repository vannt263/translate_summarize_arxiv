    "an understanding of the structure of the proton in terms of partons , i.e. quarks and gluons which follow qcd dynamics , was established to a large extent in lepton - proton , in particular electron - proton , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . at the hera @xmath23 collider with an electron - proton centre - of - mass energy of @xmath24=320  gev , effects of the electroweak sector",
    "can also be tested in dis in the region where the squared four momentum transfer @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath29 and @xmath22 boson masses ) .",
    "in addition , signals of new physics beyond the standard model may be expected to arise at the highest @xmath2 where the proton structure is probed at smallest distances .    deep inelastic scattering , fig .  [ fig1 ] , depends on three variables , @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark and @xmath33 is the inelasticity of the interaction .",
    "the variables are related via @xmath34 .",
    "the electron - proton neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) cross sections can each be expressed in terms of three proton structure functions .",
    "for neutral current interactions mediated by a @xmath35 or @xmath29  boson , the proton structure function @xmath9 dominates the cross section and is proportional to the sum of the quark momentum distributions weighted by the quark charge squared .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath10 is directly sensitive to the gluon momentum distribution .",
    "the structure function @xmath36 is related to valence quarks only .",
    "these three proton structure functions have been measured at hera and confronted with the standard model predictions . the gluon momentum distribution and the strong coupling @xmath12 determined in a qcd analysis of the hera inclusive data have been cross checked in more exclusive channels such as charm and jet production via boson gluon fusion .",
    "the propagator mass @xmath28 has been determined from the @xmath2 dependence of the cc interactions and can be compared with direct @xmath28 mass measurements in @xmath37 and @xmath38 interactions .",
    "thus , measurements at hera provide tests of both components of the theory , the electroweak sector and the evolution of the parton densities as predicted by perturbative qcd .",
    "the first @xmath16 measurements@xcite in @xmath23 interactions at hera , based on a luminosity of 0.025 pb@xmath39 collected in 1992 , revealed at low @xmath6 a pronounced rise of @xmath16 with decreasing @xmath6 which generated a new interest in qcd in dis . since then the collected luminosity has been increased by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the h1 and zeus detectors have been continuously improved . in 1995/1996 new detector components",
    "were installed by h1 : the backward calorimeter spacal , the backward drift chamber bdc and the backward silicon tracker bst . in 1995",
    "the zeus collaboration installed a beam pipe calorimeter ( bpc ) and in 1997 a beam pipe tracker ( bpt ) was added , covering very small angles of the scattered electron .",
    "these improvements and the increase in luminosity made it possible to extend the measured region@xcite to very low @xmath40  gev@xmath5 , covering the transition region from dis to real photoproduction ( @xmath41 ) , as well as very high @xmath42  gev@xmath5 .",

    "the full error band includes in addition the uncertainties connected with the fit ansatz ( `` model uncertainty '' ) . the dglap analysis of the data leads to a gluon distribution which rises dramatically at small @xmath6 with increasing @xmath2 .",
