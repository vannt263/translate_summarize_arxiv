    "one of the goals of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) is to obtain spectra for @xmath610@xmath8 quasars , in addition to the @xmath9 galaxies which comprise the bulk of the spectroscopic targets . from astrometrically calibrated drift - scanned imaging data ( gunn et  al .",

    "2002 ) .",
    "the first data release of the sdss ( dr1 ; 2003 ) includes fluxed , wavelength - calibrated spectra of @xmath617,000 quasars ( schneider et  al .",
    "this enormous sample includes some quasars with unusual properties .",
    "one example is sdss j095253.83 + 011421.9 ( hereafter sdss j0952 + 0114 ) , whose spectrum shows both broad and narrow metal - line emission but only narrow ly@xmath3  emission ( fig .",
    "[ f_spec ] ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate possible explanations for the missing broad ly@xmath3  in sdss j0952 + 0114 , namely : dust in the broad - line gas (  [ dust ] ) , anisotropic ly@xmath3  emission (  [ rad ] ) , broad - line gas with unusual physical properties such that ly@xmath3  is intrinsically weak (  [ par ] ) , an unusual spectrum incident on the broad - line region (  [ ir ] ) , or an absorption effect wherein nv  and ly@xmath3  absorption remove the red and blue wings of broad ly@xmath3 , respectively (  [ abs ] ) .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ con ] .",
    "relevant instrumental and observational details of the sdss can be found in ( 2003 ) .",
    "here we simply summarize the results on sdss j0952 + 0114 , which was targeted for spectroscopy as a @xmath11 quasar candidate .",
    "it was undetected in the first survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) , and with a magnitude of @xmath12 ( schneider et  al .",
    "2003 ) it is radio - quiet , with radio - loudness parameter @xmath13 ( ivezi ' c et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained twice using the sdss spectrographs , on modified julian dates 51608 and 51908 , in very similar seeing conditions .",
    "the latest spectrophotometrically calibrated versions of these spectra15% flux difference due to spectrophotometric calibration errors ( abazajian et  al .",
    "2004 ) . ] differ in that the continuum of the earlier spectrum is significantly bluer ( see below ) . for our analysis , we coadded the latest versions of the two sdss spectra of sdss j0952 + 0114 , weighting by the inverse variance at each pixel ( fig .",
    "[ f_spec ] ) .",
    "we adopted a systemic redshift of @xmath14 from an initial fit to the narrow components of ly@xmath3 , nv , and ciii ] .",
    "this redshift is statistically identical to the @xmath15 given in ( 2003 ) .",
    "we fit a power law from 1348  to 2257  rest frame , excluding broad emission line wavelength regions listed in table 2 of vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , hereafter v01 .",
    "we found a best - fit power - law spectral index ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath17 .",
    "this uncertainty is conservative in the sense that it assumes that the different exponents for power - law fits to the individual sdss spectra ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ) are caused entirely by spectrophotometric errors , when in fact they could be caused entirely by variability . between ly@xmath3  and nv  there is a window @xmath61350kms@xmath2  wide where the observed spectrum matches this power - law continuum fit ( see fig .",
    "[ f_split ] ) , which indicates that the ly@xmath3  and nv  emission lines are not significantly blended .",
    "we normalized the spectrum by our power - law fit to the continuum before analyzing the emission and absorption lines in detail ( see  [ fit ] ) .",
    "figure[f_spec ] shows that sdss j0952 + 0114  has a narrow emission - line component ( seen in ly@xmath3 , civ , and other metal lines ) plus an asymmetric , broad emission - line component seen in nv , civ  and ciii ]  but not in ly@xmath3 .",
    "emission lines in individual quasars have similar but not necessarily identical profiles .",
    "just how much of an outlier sdss j0952 + 0114  is in the distribution of relative linewidths would require a detailed study of the sdss quasar sample beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in any case , no other similarly extreme spectrum exists among the @xmath63600 quasars in the sdss data release two for which ly@xmath3  falls within the spectral coverage of the sdss spectrographs ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "if the gas responsible for the broad components of the emission lines contains dust , and has a sufficient optical depth to ly@xmath3  at all velocities , the broad - component ly@xmath3  photons could be destroyed by the dust before escaping .",
    "( ly@xmath3  is a resonance line  a strong , permitted transition from the ground state of an ion  and thus has a small mean free path for absorption or scattering . )",
    "this effect can not be ruled out , but it appears unlikely for several reasons .",
    "most dust can not survive long in typical high - density , high - ionization blr conditions ( laor & draine 1993 ) and would be more likely to be found in the narrow - component gas , given the trend for narrower lines to arise farther from the central engine ( peterson & wandel 2000 )",
    ". there may be rare cases of objects with transient dust in their blr , since dust destruction is not instantaneous .",
    "however , nv@xmath211238,1242  and civ@xmath211548,1550  are also resonance lines that should be affected by dust . that is , dust by itself can not make the civ / ly@xmath3  or nv / ly@xmath3  ratios arbitrarily large ( at least not without reducing all the lines equivalent widths far below their observed values ) .",
    "narrow - line agns with weak ly@xmath3  attributed to resonant scattering and destruction by dust , rather than just to ly@xmath3  absorption , have @xmath22civ / ly@xmath3@xmath231.4 ( dey , spinrad , & dickinson 1995 ; de breuck et  al .",
    "2001 ; dawson et  al .",
    "this is much smaller than the civ / ly@xmath3@xmath1@xmath24 measured for the blueshifted broad - component gas in sdss j0952 + 0114 , at @xmath25kms@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , while dust could contribute to the weakness of the broad ly@xmath3  in sdss j0952 + 0114 , it is not likely to be the dominant effect .",
    "if the broad - component gas contains a hydrogen ionization front , the ly@xmath3  will be emitted only from the illuminated face of the cloud ( with source function @xmath26 ) , while civ  can be emitted more isotropically .",
    "for example , with @xmath27@xmath28 , log@xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the ratio of ionizing photon to total hydrogen densities ) , and densities @xmath31@xmath5 , civ  is nearly isotropic and will have a rest - frame equivalent width approximately equal to that observed in sdss j0952 + 0114  ( see  2.6 and fig",
    ". 7 of 1997a ) .",
    "given such conditions , it may be possible to construct kinematic blr models such that from some viewing directions the ly@xmath3  profile is dramatically narrower than the civ  profile .",
    "a full study of this possibility would require coupling photoionization studies incorporating anisotropic emission with specific geometric and kinematical models of the blr .",
    "however , after consideration of numerous toy models , we do not believe that the spectrum of sdss j0952 + 0114  can be reproduced by recourse solely to anisotropic emission .",
    "the most anisotropic toy model is one where the blr is a wind flowing off an optically thick accretion disk at a 45  angle with velocity @xmath32 and is viewed at that same angle above the disk . because of the anisotropy of ly@xmath3 , the part of the wind nearest to us ( azimuthal angle @xmath33 ) does not emit ly@xmath3  along our sightline , only isotropic civ  ( blueshifted by velocity @xmath32 ) .",
    "the part of the wind farthest from us ( @xmath34 ) emits ly@xmath3  as well as civ  along our sightline , with zero projected velocity and only turbulent broadening , since our sightline is normal to the outflow direction there . summed over all @xmath35 , this model produces blueshifted civ  emission which is broader than ly@xmath3 .",
    "however , it can not produce the red wing of the civ  emission line , which is redshifted relative to ly@xmath3 . nor can it produce ly@xmath3  narrow enough to match the observations : the maximum observed civ  emission velocity ( @xmath69000kms@xmath2 ) corresponds to @xmath32 in this model , and at a line of sight velocity of @xmath36 the ly@xmath3  emission is down from its peak strength by only a factor of @xmath37 , compared to a factor of @xmath38 in the observed spectrum .",
    "similarly , a central obscuring disk embedded in an outflowing , ionization - stratified blr can produce a blue wing of civ  without strong ly@xmath3  ( fig .",
    "26 of 1990 )  essentially by making the emission anisotropic after the fact  but it can not produce a broad red wing of civ  without ly@xmath3 , nor can it explain linewidth differences as large as seen in sdss j0952 + 0114 . thus , anisotropic ly@xmath3  emission alone is unlikely to explain the unusual spectrum of sdss j0952 + 0114 .",
    "( 1997a ) have used the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland et  al . 1998 ) to compile plots of predicted quasar blr emission - line rest - frame equivalent widths ( rews ) as functions of the column density , incident ionizing spectrum , and metal abundance of the emitting gas clouds .",
    "we used these plots to investigate whether significant nv , civ , and ciii ]   emission without accompanying ly@xmath3  emission is expected to occur anywhere in the range of parameter space occupied by typical quasar blrs .",
    "we were unable to find any regions of parameter space which simultaneously met the observed constraints on the total rew@xmath39 , rew@xmath40 and the line ratio civ / ly@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with detailed modelling of the quasar q  0207@xmath41398 by ( 1996 ) .",
    "q  0207@xmath41398 has a very broad emission component with civ / ly@xmath3@xmath42 ( baldwin et  al .",
    ". the cloudy simulations of ( 1996 ) and our own cloudy simulations show that a civ / ly@xmath3  ratio of @xmath42 is the maximum which can be produced over a wide range of @xmath43 for metallicities between half and five times solar .",
    "thus , the measured civ / ly@xmath3@xmath44 in the broad emission component of sdss j0952 + 0114  can not be explained in the same manner as the civ / ly@xmath3@xmath42 of q  0207@xmath41398 .",
    "dust destruction of ly@xmath3  will not substantially increase the maximum civ / ly@xmath3  ratio because the maximum ratio only occurs for optically thin clouds in which hydrogen is fully ionized and ly@xmath3  photons are not resonantly trapped .",
    "ly@xmath3  photons are therefore more likely to escape from such clouds than to be destroyed by dust .",
    "however , the above results come from photoionization simulations which extend only to densities @xmath45 @xmath5 and column densities @xmath46 @xmath28 , and different behavior may be seen when both parameters are an order of magnitude or more larger .",
    "ly@xmath3/h@xmath47  ratios @xmath6100 times lower than the typical observed value of @xmath610 ( ferland 1999 ) can be produced in photoionization simulations of accretion disks reaching @xmath48 @xmath28 and @xmath49 @xmath5 ( rokaki , boisson , & collin - souffrin 1992 ) .",
    "ly@xmath3  photons are trapped by resonant scattering at such high column densities , and as the density increases above @xmath50 @xmath5 the ly@xmath3  rew steadily decreases due to increasing collisional deexcitation of the @xmath51 level of and bound - free absorption by neutral metals or in an @xmath52 level ( see  3.3 of & collin - souffrin 1990 or fig . 5 of 1999 ) .",
    "evidence for emission from gas at such high densities has previously been found by ( 1996 ) in the broad - line radio galaxy arp 102b , which shows broad , double - peaked emission line components in h@xmath47  and civ  but only single - peaked emission in ly@xmath3  ( their fig .",
    "3 ) .    to test the viability of high-@xmath53 , high-@xmath43 models for sdss j0952 + 0114 , we ran photoionization simulations with cloudy ( using its standard incident agn spectrum ) for densities up to @xmath54@xmath5 and column densities up to @xmath55@xmath28 over a wide range of ionization parameters .",
    "the highest civ / ly@xmath3  ratio we found for optically thick clouds with ionization fronts ( @xmath56@xmath28 ) was civ / ly@xmath3@xmath66 , for @xmath49@xmath5 and @xmath57 .",
    "( increasing the column density above the optically thick limit does not affect civ / ly@xmath3 , though it may affect ratios of low - ionization line strengths relative to ly@xmath3 . ) however , even with 100% covering of the ionizing source by the blr , the rew@xmath39 for such models is only 0.93.8 .",
    "this is at least an order of magnitude lower than the broad component rew@xmath39=42  observed in sdss j0952 + 0114 .",
    "slightly higher civ / ly@xmath3  ratios ( @xmath68 ) can be reached in clouds with column densities an order of magnitude below the optically thick limit , but the rew discrepancies are even worse in such cases .",
    "the ` best fit ' modelled and observed numbers could be reconciled only if the continuum flux in sdss j0952 + 0114  was suppressed by at least an order of magnitude , but there is no evidence that is the case .",
    "we conclude that high densities alone can not simultaneously explain the abnormal civ / ly@xmath3  line ratio and the normal civ  and ly@xmath3  rews in sdss j0952 + 0114 .",
    "the civ / ly@xmath3  ratio in the broad - line gas in sdss j0952 + 0114  is a factor of 2.5@xmath580.8 higher than in our ` best fit ' photoionization model ( @xmath49@xmath5 , @xmath59@xmath28 and @xmath57 ) , and the civ  rew is at least an order of magnitude higher .",
    "( 1999 ) discusses the spectrum of an ionized cloud as a function of additional physical parameters besides those considered in ( 1997a ) .",
    "unusual values of such additional parameters might help explain the observations .",
    "inspection of the various plots in ( 1999 ) shows that the _ only _ parameter which might substantially affect the observables civ / ly@xmath3  and rew@xmath39 is the assumed long - wavelength cutoff wavelength of the incident power - law ( his fig .",
    "3 ) . extending this cutoff from its arbitrary default value of 0.912   to @xmath60200  would increase civ / ly@xmath3  by a factor of two or more , and rew@xmath39 by a factor of five or more .",
    "the greater infrared flux increases the temperature of the gas through free - free heating without increasing its ionization . for a sufficiently long cutoff wavelength ( @xmath60200 ) , the flux from purely collisionally excited coolant lines like civ , nv  and ovi  increases more than the flux from recombination lines like ly@xmath3  ( though ly@xmath3  can be collisionally excited as well , of course ) .",
    "the sed required by this scenario is consistent with the observed range of quasar seds ( elvis et  al .",
    "the putative far - ir power - law can not extend to radio wavelengths , however , since sdss j0952 + 0114  is radio - quiet .",
    "the emission - line rews of sdss j0952 + 0114  are mostly consistent with this scenario . compared to the composite sdss quasar spectrum of ( 2001 )",
    ", sdss j0952 + 0114  has a total ly@xmath3  rew a factor of three smaller than average and a total civ  rew a factor of three higher .",
    "however , the rew of the broad ciii ]   emission is quite high , and such emission can not arise in high density gas since the upper state of that transition is collisionally deexcited at densities @xmath61 @xmath5 ( conversely , ciii@xmath62977  is a strong coolant at high densities but is not observed to be unusually strong here ) .",
    "moreover , broad ciii ]  emission should be accompanied by broad ly@xmath3  emission with at least ly@xmath3/ciii]=5 , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "we can think of two explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "the first is a decrease in the blr gas density at the ionization front where the ciii ]   emissivity is highest , which would maximize the observed ratio of ciii]/ly@xmath3 .",
    "coupled with high densities in the blr up to the ionization front and an incident power - law extending well into the far - ir , this scenario might simultaneously explain the unusually large broad - line civ / ly@xmath3  ratio , the low ly@xmath3  rew , and the observed broad ciii ] .",
    "however , it still predicts much stronger ciii977  emission than observed , and a model which invokes such a specific and ad hoc combination of parameters can not be considered robust , even for a uniquely unusual quasar from a sample of @xmath63600 .",
    "the second possible explanation for the lack of broad ly@xmath3  accompanying the observed broad ciii ]  is that the broad ly@xmath3  exists but is hidden by absorption , a possibility we consider in detail in the next section .",
    "sdss j0952 + 0114  may have a ly@xmath3  profile which merely _ appears _ narrow due to moderately broad , blueshifted absorption from ly@xmath3  ( in the blue wing of the ly@xmath3  emission line ) and from nv  ( in the red wing of the ly@xmath3  emission line ) .",
    "such absorption could originate in the host galaxy or in an outflow related to the quasar . to investigate this possibility , we modelled the emission and absorption lines seen in sdss j0952 + 0114 .",
    "a single gaussian was used to represent the profile of each absorption line and of most emission lines .",
    "some emission lines required more than one gaussian : two were used for ciii ] , and three for ly@xmath3 , nv , siiv  and civ  ( three components are often used to model quasar emission lines ; see , e.g. , 1994 ) .",
    "strong emission lines from table 2 of v01 were included in the fit , along with a broad gaussian near 1600  ( to fit feii  multiplets there ) and another near 1280  ( presumably due to feii  multiplet uv9 ) .",

    "the narrow absorption in the spectrum is shown in detail in figure [ f_split ] and is discussed in detail in appendix [ app ] .      to study the unabsorbed line profiles , we `` repaired '' the spectrum by reversing the sign of the amplitude of our single - gaussian fits to the absorption lines and adding those gaussians to the observed spectrum .",
    "the `` repaired '' spectrum is therefore our best estimate of the spectrum as it would have been seen without narrow absorption .",
    "figure [ f_repair]a plots the ly@xmath3 , civ  and nv  regions of the raw spectrum of sdss j0952 + 0114   as a function of outflow velocity relative to their laboratory wavelengths ( table 2 of v01 ) at @xmath0 . the same plot using the `` repaired '' spectrum is shown in figure [ f_repair]b . _ even after removing the effects of narrow , associated absorption , _",

    "we reconstructed ovi  as two doublets , each with 75% of the total civ  flux , then multiplied the reconstructed spectrum at those wavelengths by 0.75 to match the surrounding continuum and thus account for ly@xmath3  forest absorption .",
    "we reconstructed nv  as two doublets , each wth 45% of the total civ  flux , and broad ly@xmath3  as a single line with flux equal to that of civ .",
    "we then divided the observed spectrum by this assumed intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the result is an estimate of the total absorption profile required to explain the observed line profiles of ly@xmath3 , nv  and ovi  as a function of velocity .",

    "broad absorption line troughs have never been seen to unambiguously cover only the blr and not the continuum source , which is understandable since the blr is thought to surround the much smaller continuum source .",

    "the arguments for smooth absorption are that the red wing of nv  matches the red wing of civ , ly@xmath3  may recover to the civ  profile in its far blue wing , and the lack of broad ] and broad ly@xmath3  which should accompany broad nv   and broad ciii ] , respectively , is difficult to explain except via absorption .",
    "we have discussed the unusual spectrum of sdss j0952 + 0114 , which exhibits broad metal - line emission but only narrow ly@xmath3  emission .",
    "we argue that this unusual spectrum can not be _ solely _ due to dust extinction in the blr , to anisotropic emission of ly@xmath3 , or to unusual physical conditions in the blr .",
    "most but not all of the spectrum s properties are explainable as emission from a blr of predominantly high density gas ( @xmath70 @xmath5 ) , which suppresses ly@xmath3 , illuminated by an incident power - law continuum extending to @xmath60200 , which increases the collisionally excited metal - line emission . however , the blr in sdss j0952 + 0114  can not consist exclusively of high density gas because the observed broad ciii ]  emission would be collisionally deexcited at densities higher than @xmath71 @xmath5 .",
    "although it is not entirely satisfactory , the most plausible explanation we have found for the apparent lack of broad ly@xmath3  is that it is due to smooth absorption by nv  in the red wing of ly@xmath3  and by ly@xmath3  in the blue wing of ly@xmath3 .",
    "such absorption must be in addition to the complex , narrow intrinsic absorption system seen , would have to almost exactly cancel the intrinsic broad emission ( which might mean that it is the first known example of a broad absorption line trough which covers the blr but not the continuum source ) , and must be present in ovi , nv  and ly@xmath3  but not in siiv  or in civ , which is quite unusual . in any case , it seems that some _ combination _ of unusual parameters is required to explain sdss j0952 + 0114 , which helps explain why its spectrum is one of a kind .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of sdss j0952 + 0114  should consist of a typical power - law plus absorption if the postulated highly - ionized , smooth absorption is real . on the other hand , if its line ratios are largely intrinsic and the trends of civ / ly@xmath3  with other observables found by ( 1999 )",
    "can be extrapolated over an order of magnitude to apply to sdss j0952 + 0114 , it should have a very soft x - ray spectrum , a very broad h@xmath47 line , weak optical feii  emission , and strong [ oiii ]  emission .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest all these trends may derive from a small eddington parameter ( the accretion rate relative to the eddington rate ) . while sdss j0952 + 0114  may not provide direct insight on the typical quasar blr if it is indeed a high - density blr illuminated by an unusual sed , it does help delineate the range of physical parameter space which blrs occupy and which must therefore be incorporated into blr models .",
    "for example , quasar broad - line civ / ly@xmath3   ratios may be strongly affected by free - free heating of the blr , but as ( 1999 ) point out , very little work has been done to investigate the effects of free - free heating on quasar spectra , despite the fact that it can have a greater effect on the observed spectrum than the incident x - ray continuum .",
    "the most useful future observation of sdss j0952 + 0114  would probably be flux - calibrated spectroscopy at higher resolution to better determine the true profiles of the emission lines , and thus the presence or absence of smooth absorption , by reducing the confusing effects of the many narrow absorption lines present ( and also to enable physical modeling of the narrow , associated absorbers ) .",
    "it would also be valuable to obtain an x - ray hardness ratio measurement and near - ir spectroscopy of mgii , h@xmath72 and h@xmath47 . and if sdss j0952 + 0114  has a blr exposed to a power - law continuum extending from x - ray wavelengths to @xmath60200 , or @xmath60800  observed , scuba or _",
    "photometry at those wavelengths could search for that continuum directly ( with the caveat that there is good evidence that the continuum illuminating the blr in quasars can be different from the continuum seen along our lines of sight to individual quasars ; , ferland , & baldwin 1997b ) .",

    "we identify five associated ( and two intervening ) narrow absorption systems in sdss j0952 + 0114   and denote them a through e in order of increasing outflow velocity . a higher - resolution spectrum with a high signal - to - noise ratio",
    "is needed to study these absorbers in detail and eliminate the numerous ambiguities due to blending .",
    "the absorption around the ovi  emission line is particularly complex , and suffers from ly@xmath3  forest contamination as well .",
    "the strongest associated absorption system ( a ) includes rare , excited , metastable oi * , cii * and siii * lines ( though the putative siii*@xmath621533 seems anomalously weak ) and is blueshifted by @xmath73770@xmath58100kms@xmath2  from the systemic redshift , neglecting the global uncertainty in the latter .",
    "system b at @xmath741310@xmath5810kms@xmath2  ( which also includes cii * absorption ) exhibits line - locking with system a ( scargle 1973 ; braun & milgrom 1989 ) , since the velocity difference @xmath75kms@xmath2   is consistent with the velocity separation of the civ  doublet ( 497kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "there is also ly@xmath3  absorption at @xmath76kms@xmath2",
    ". there may be civ  absorption at @xmath77kms@xmath2 , possibly accompanied by ly@xmath3  ( the putative civ@xmath621548 is blended with siii*@xmath621533 from system a , and the putative ly@xmath3   with siiii@xmath621206.5 absorption from system b ) .",
    "finally , there is ly@xmath47 , ly@xmath3 , nv  and possibly ovi  absorption at @xmath78kms@xmath2 .    one complication with modelling the absorption systems is that at least some of them exhibit full covering of the continuum source but only partial covering of the emission - line region , a common feature in intrinsic absorption systems ( e.g. , 1997 ) . at the wavelength of the blended ly@xmath47  absorption from systems",
    "a and b ( @xmath79 ; see table [ t_abs ] ) , the residual flux over 2 - 3 resolution elements is consistent with zero ( measuring 2.6@xmath585.6% of the normalized intrinsic spectrum ) , and similarly at ly@xmath72 .",
    "however , the residual flux in ly@xmath3  at the same redshift measures much more than 2.6% of the estimated intrinsic spectrum at that wavelength .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained if the absorption covers the continuum source but not the ly@xmath3  emission - line region .",
    "these different covering factors do not greatly affect the fitting but might affect the interpretation of absorption doublet line ratios near emission lines .",
    "the physical conditions in the various absorbers may be quite different .",
    "we derive an approximate @xmath80 value for each absorber by finding the @xmath80 value which produces a voigt absorption profile whose fwhm equals the resolution - corrected fwhm of our fit to the system s ly@xmath3  absorption ( see , e.g. , fig . 14 of 2003 ) .",
    "system a has log(@xmath80)@xmath618.7 @xmath28 , absorption from many low - ionization species ( sufficiently strong to suggest solar metallicity ) , relatively weak ovi  and nv  absorption , and excited - state absorption indicating densities of at least @xmath81 @xmath5 .",
    "it may also contain dust : if the tentative 2026   absorption is real and is identified as znii  instead of mgi , there may be accompanying znii@xmath622062 , but there is no sign of crii@xmath622056 or crii@xmath622066 . if confirmed by a better spectrum , this would indicate that crii  is depleted onto dust in the absorber .",
    "system b is detected in a range of ionization states from cii  to ovi , but there is no unambiguous evidence for excited - state absorption in it .",
    "system c is unambiguously detected only in ly@xmath3 , probably due to a low column density .",
    "systems d and e appear more highly ionized on average , with possible detections of ovi  and civ  in the former and nv  in the latter .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 quasar sdss j095253.83 + 011421.9 exhibits broad metal - line emission ( civ  fwhm@xmath19000 kms@xmath2 ) , but broad ly@xmath3  emission is not present . instead , only a narrow ly@xmath3  line is observed ( fwhm@xmath11140 kms@xmath2 ) . the large civ / ly@xmath3  ratio in the broad - line region ( blr ) emission from this object can be matched most closely by a blr dominated by gas at very high densities ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , which suppresses the ly@xmath3  emission , and illuminated by an incident power - law extending to @xmath6200 , which yields increased emission from purely collisionally excited coolant lines ( such as civ , nv  and ovi ) but not from recombination lines like ly@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . however , the strong ciii  emission predicted by this model is not observed , and the observed broad ciii ]  emission must come from a lower - density blr component and should be accompanied by broad ly@xmath3   emission which is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> the least unlikely explanation for this spectrum seems to be that any intrinsic broad ly@xmath3  emission is removed by smooth nv  absorption in the red wing of the ly@xmath3  emission line and by smooth ly@xmath3  absorption in the blue wing of the ly@xmath3  emission line . </S>",
    "<S> this postulated smooth absorption would be in addition to the strong , associated , narrow absorption seen in numerous ions . </S>",
    "<S> smooth absorption in ly@xmath3 , nv  and ovi   but not in civ  would be unusual , but not impossible , although it is suspicious that the postulated absorption must almost exactly cancel the postulated intrinsic broad emission . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the spectrum of sdss j0952 + 0114  appears unique ( among @xmath13600 sdss spectra of quasars at @xmath7 ) because of some _ combination _ of unusual parameters , and we discuss possible observations to determine the combination of circumstances responsible for the spectrum . </S>"
