    "this paper extends an earlier calculation by @xcite of the amplitude equation governing faraday waves in the weakly nonlinear regime . in order to make the problem analytically tractable",
    ", they neglected without rigorous justification viscous terms in the boundary conditions at the free fluid surface that had a nonlinear dependence on either the surface displacement away from planarity , or on the surface velocity .",
    "even though the resulting amplitude equation led to the prediction of stationary patterns that are generally in agreement with experiments conducted in the regime of weak viscous dissipation ( @xcite ) , the unsystematic nature of the truncation makes it difficult to asses the range of validity of the theory .",
    "in particular , the so - called stripe pattern ( a pattern comprised of a single standing wave ) which is generically observed when viscous dissipation is not small , could not be obtained in their analysis for any range of parameters .",
    "we extend below this earlier work , and present a systematic weakly nonlinear theory of faraday waves .",
    "our results on pattern selection agree with those of @xcite and ( 1997 ) in the limit of small viscous dissipation , and with recent experimental work otherwise .",
    "parametrically driven surface waves ( also known as faraday waves ) can be excited on the free surface of a fluid layer that is periodically vibrated in the direction normal to the surface at rest when the amplitude of the driving acceleration is large enough to overcome the dissipative effect of fluid viscosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "of special concern to us is the issue of pattern selection in a layer of lateral dimension much larger than the excited wavelength ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review on pattern formation ) . in the case of faraday waves",
    ", it is now known that different wave patterns can be excited depending on the fluid properties and the driving amplitude or frequency . at high viscous dissipation ( a fluid of large viscosity and/or a low driving frequency ) ,",
    "the observed wave pattern above threshold consists of parallel stripes ( @xcite and @xcite ) . for lower dissipation",
    ", patterns of square symmetry ( combinations of two perpendicular plane waves ) are observed in the capillary regime ( large frequencies ) ( @xcite ) . at lower frequencies ( the mixed gravity - capillary regime ) , higher symmetry patterns",
    "have been observed by @xcite ( hexagonal ) and @xcite ( hexagonal , eight- and ten - fold ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a weakly nonlinear analysis of faraday waves that predicts stationary wave patterns with these symmetries .",
    "the derivation of an amplitude equation is a classical method to describe excited states beyond linear instability . just above threshold ,",
    "the evolution of the system is assumed to be described in terms of the complex amplitude @xmath4 of the most unstable mode according to linear theory .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath4 is often of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the linear growth rate , and @xmath7 is real .",
    "the low order nonlinear term provides saturation .",
    "there exist cases , however , in which spatial isotropy permits waves to be excited in any direction , and the nonlinear interaction term in the equation above contains terms of the form @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 the slowly varying amplitudes of two degenerate unstable modes . if the coupling coefficients @xmath11 are known , the resulting wave pattern can be predicted from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp_intro ] ) , as has been illustrated by @xcite for faraday waves .",
    "the derivation of amplitude equations for surface waves is greatly simplified in the case of an ideal ( inviscid ) fluid . since the bulk flow is irrotational",
    ", there exists a hamiltonian formulation in which the canonically conjugate variables are the surface displacement and the velocity potential at the free surface ( @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "early analyses of faraday waves were based on the hamiltonian description of the inviscid limit , and treated viscous or dissipative effects as a perturbation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation usually starts from the set of ideal fluid equations ( @xcite ) , written in terms of the surface velocity potential @xmath12 .",
    "the linear or zero - th order solution @xmath13 is a sum over waves of frequency @xmath14 and wavevector @xmath15 , with @xmath14 and @xmath16 related by the ideal fluid dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ideal_dispersion ] ) below ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a slow time scale , with @xmath19 the dimensionless distance away from threshold .",
    "an expansion of the ideal fluid equations to third order in @xmath20 yields the equation for @xmath21 ( @xcite ) @xmath22 with @xmath23 the amplitude of the driving acceleration , and @xmath24 _ real _ functions of the angle between the @xmath25-th and @xmath26-th wavevectors .",
    "since the coefficients of the cubic terms are imaginary , these terms do not contribute to wave saturation .",
    "this can be seen , for example , by computing @xmath27 and observing that all cubic terms cancel .",
    "this is also a manifestation of a general symmetry principle in hamiltonian ( or reversible ) systems that prohibits _ real _ coefficients of cubic nonlinear terms in standing wave amplitude equations ( @xcite ) .    in the limit of low viscous dissipation ,",
    "hamilton s equations have been supplemented with a dissipation function ( @xcite ) , which is computed under the assumption that the dominant contribution to viscous dissipation arises from the irrotational velocity field in the bulk , and not from friction at the container walls or dissipation near the free surface ( where vorticity is produced ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the rate of energy loss is given by ( @xcite ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the shear viscosity , and the integral extends over the bulk fluid .",
    "the velocity potential @xmath12 is now expanded in powers of @xmath20 , and viscous contributions computed order by order in @xmath20 .",
    "this procedure leads to imaginary components in the coefficients of the cubic terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : milner ] ) , and therefore to wave saturation . the precise functional form of the coefficients obtained by this method is still somewhat controversial ( @xcite ) .",
    "we next address the effect of the rotational component of the flow .",
    "the dimensionless group involving the ratio of viscous to inertial effects is the damping parameter @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the critical wavenumber in the inviscid limit , and @xmath32 its angular frequency ( @xmath0 is inversely proportional to the reynolds number of the flow ) . @xcite",
    "considered an expansion of the governing equations and boundary conditions in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "they showed that in the weak dissipation limit , the dominant terms in the boundary conditions are @xmath33 , with a first correction at @xmath34 . at _ linear _ order in the surface displacement or surface velocity , terms of @xmath33 are purely irrotational , while the rotational flow component contributes at @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , linear stability analysis of faraday waves by @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : equations ] ) shows that the dimensionless value of the driving amplitude at threshold equals @xmath0 , with a first correction term that is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the dominant contribution arises solely from the irrotational flow component , with contributions from the rotational component coming at @xmath34 .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the lowest order contribution from both irrotational and rotational components is @xmath33 at the nonlinear level in the surface variables .",
    "hence rotational flow can not be neglected in a nonlinear theory , even in the limit of small dissipation .",
    "for example , the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface does include one such term proportional to @xmath0 that arises from the component normal to the surface of the rotational part of the velocity field .",
    "this term was retained both in the analysis of @xcite and in our analysis below , but not in previous approaches based on a dissipation function .",
    "another qualitative feature of importance to pattern selection in faraday waves is triad resonant interactions . since the standing wave amplitude equation must be invariant under @xmath36 , .",
    "subharmonic response implies that @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the position of the surface .",
    "because of this invariance , the amplitude equation for @xmath39 must also be invariant under a sign change in @xmath39 ] triad resonance can not contribute directly to quadratic order in @xmath39 , but it does contribute significantly to the coefficients of the cubic order term via the coupling of the zero - th order unstable wave and first order stable waves .",
    "this resonance was already encountered by @xcite as a divergence of the cubic coefficient in the standing wave amplitude equation at a particular angle .",
    "later , @xcite suggested that triad resonance would be important at low viscous dissipation , range in which linearly stable modes are only weakly damped .",
    "@xcite calculated such a contribution explicitly , and showed that it is important in determining the symmetry of the selected pattern in the region of small @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , they predicted a sequence of quasi - periodic patterns in the region in which the resonant angle approaches zero .",
    "we extend in this paper the analysis of @xcite that was based on a quasi - potential approximation to the governing equations . by separating the rotational flow within a small vortical layer near the free surface from the potential flow in the bulk",
    ", they derived a standing wave amplitude equation valid in the limit of small viscous dissipation .",
    "the calculation , however , relied on an uncontrolled approximation concerning nonlinear viscous terms and , as a consequence , its region of validity is difficult to asses .",
    "we describe below a systematic expansion of the navier - stokes equation and boundary conditions that overcomes this difficulty and that leads to an amplitude equation not restricted to small viscous dissipation .",
    "we start by deriving an exact , although implicit , relation for the threshold of instability , which is then used in the nonlinear analysis .",
    "this result extends earlier numerical work by @xcite , and agrees with a recent low viscosity approximation to the governing equations by @xcite .",
    "we then use a multiple scale expansion to derive a standing wave equation which is of gradient form .",
    "minimization of the associated lyapunov function leads to the prediction of stationary patterns of different symmetries as a function of the fluid parameters and frequency of the driving acceleration .",
    "our predictions are in good agreement with experiments conducted in large aspect ratio cells .",
    "we consider a semi - infinite fluid layer , unbounded in the @xmath41 direction , extending to @xmath42 , and with a planar free surface at @xmath43 when at rest .",
    "the fluid is assumed incompressible and newtonian . under periodic vibration of the layer in the direction normal to the surface at rest , the equation governing fluid motion ( in the co - moving reference frame ) is @xmath44 with @xmath45 the velocity field , @xmath46 the pressure , @xmath47 and @xmath48 the density and kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively , and @xmath49 the effective gravity . instead of @xmath50 as in @xcite to avoid , as discussed in that reference , the complication related to the parity under time reversal of the driving acceleration . ] the base state is a quiescent fluid with a pressure distribution @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) ) and two recent sets of experiments that addressed pattern selection in the large aspect ratio limit by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the only input parameters in our calculations are the fluid properties ( density , surface tension and viscosity ) , and the frequency of the driving acceleration .",
    "all these parameters are known fairly precisely in the experimental work , thus allowing a quantitative comparison between theory and experiments .",
    "pattern selection in the low viscosity range has been recently studied by @xcite .",
    "they have developed a cell of exceptionally large aspect ratio , and of depth that is much larger than the wavelength .",

    "a possible explanation for the larger discrepancy between the experiments and the calculations of @xcite involves the fact that they only used the term linear in @xmath0 in the calculation of the threshold for instability ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : threshold_ld ] ) ) . omitting the first correction ( of order @xmath35 ) yields a similar percentage error in the threshold value ( for @xmath0 in the range 0.01  0.03 as is appropriate for this experiment ) .",
    "another set of recent experiments involving fluids of different viscosity has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "although the depth of the fluid layer ( 0.3  cm ) is smaller than the wavelength of the waves ( 13  cm ) , the comparison is still illuminating .",
    "figure [ fig : expt ] shows the symmetry of the predicted patterns as a function of the viscosity of the fluid and of the driving frequency ( with @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) , and the experimentally observed patterns .",
    "they find a stripe pattern at high viscosity , a hexagonal pattern at low viscosity and frequency , and a square pattern at low viscosity and high frequency .",
    "two significant discrepancies concern the experimental observation of a hexagonal pattern at @xmath263 and low frequency , and also at @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "it is possible that the shallowness of the fluid layer can account for these differences , especially in view of the fact that , as noted above , the experiments by @xcite did probe this latter region in a deep fluid layer , and their results do agree with our predictions .    finally , the fact that portions of the boundaries separating regions of different symmetry appear almost as straight lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] is due to the log - log scale used .",
    "in addition , the transition line delimiting the region of stripe patterns is almost independent of frequency only because of the limited frequency range probed in the experiments and displayed in the figure . on the other hand ,",
    "the line separating regions of square and hexagonal patterns is almost independent of viscosity because it depends mainly on whether the waves are capillarity or gravity dominated , fact that is largely dependent on the driving frequency and not on viscosity .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented a nonlinear theory for faraday waves in viscous fluids with no assumptions or approximations other than those inherent to the multi - scale expansion .",
    "a set of standing wave amplitude equations has been obtained that is of gradient form .",
    "minimization of the associated lyapunov function leads to determination of the preferred pattern near threshold .",
    "the predicted patterns are in excellent agreement with recent experiments in large aspect ratio systems involving a range of fluid viscosities and driving frequencies . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : lya ] , the transition from square to stripe patterns remains in the capillary wave limit of @xmath231 ( high frequency limit in the experiments ) .",
    "however , the figure for @xmath251 indicates that stripe patterns are always preferred in the pure - gravity - wave limit ( low frequency limit in the experiments ) .",
    "furthermore , all the high symmetry patterns ( with @xmath266 ) are observed in the vicinity of @xmath252 , point at which the triad resonant angle approaches zero , and for low damping where the resonance is more pronounced .",
