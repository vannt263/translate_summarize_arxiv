    "for decades , the hydrogen ly@xmath0  forest absorption observed in the spectra of background quasars has been a crucial probe of the @xmath1 universe . since the realization in the mid-1990s that residual neutral hydrogen in the photoionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) is a non - linear tracer of the overall matter density distribution in the large - scale cosmic web ( the  fluctuating gunn - peterson  paradigm * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ly@xmath0  forest has enabled statistical studies of large - scale structure ( lss ) at high redshifts .    the ly@xmath0  forest in each quasar spectrum is a one - dimensional probe of the foreground igm , although a small number of close - pairs exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the area density of available quasars increase with limiting magnitude , and at faint magnitudes it becomes possible to study the 3d correlations of the ly@xmath0  forest across different lines - of - sight : the boss ly@xmath0  forest survey @xcite has observed @xmath3 quasars with an average area density of @xmath4 , enabling measurement of the large - scale two - point ly@xmath0  forest correlation function in 3d @xcite and subsequently the detection of the @xmath5 baryon acoustic oscillation scale @xcite , which is useful as a cosmological distance measure .    beyond clustering studies , it is also possible to directly interpolate separate ly@xmath0  forest sightlines to create a 3d map of the hydrogen absorption .",
    "this ` ly@xmath0  forest tomography ' was conceptually first proposed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the first pilot observations were not conducted until recently @xcite . in this article we will give a brief overview of this exciting new technique in terms of feasibility and initial pilot observations , as well as discuss future prospects .",
    "in simplest terms , ly@xmath0  forest tomography simply interpolates between a set of ly@xmath0  forest spectra to create a map of the foreground igm absorption .",
    "therefore the typical transverse separation , @xmath6 , of the background sources must match the spatial scale of the desired map , @xmath7 . at @xmath8 , the typical transverse separation of the boss ly@xmath0  forest sightlines",
    "is @xmath9 which is larger than most scales of interest , although there are efforts to create tomographic maps with boss @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 is reduced by including fainter background sources , but the quasar luminosity function is relatively shallow @xcite and even at @xmath10 , the typical sightline separation probed by quasars is @xmath11 .",
    "however , at @xmath12 , star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) begin to dominate the overall uv luminosity function @xcite , allowing very dense grids to sample the foreground forest : at @xmath13 $ ] the sightline separations are @xmath14\\,\\hmpc$ ] , respectively .",
    "the question now turns to the requirements in terms of spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in the data .",
    "if high - resolution ( @xmath15 , s / n@xmath16 per pixel ) spectra are needed , then ly@xmath0  tomography will be a limited ` novelty ' technique even with 30 m class telescopes , due to the extreme exposure times ( @xmath17hr ) needed to obtain such data with @xmath18 sources .",
    "conversely , relatively noisy ( s / n of a few ) moderate - resolution spectra ( @xmath19 ) are already achievable with existing 8 - 10 m telescopes .    in @xcite",
    ", we studied this issue using both simulations and analytic calculations . in terms of spectral resolution",
    ", the desired reconstruction scale , @xmath20 , must be resolved along the line - of - sight ( los ) , therefore one needs merely @xmath21^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "as for the necessary s / n , the requirements depend on @xmath20 as well as the desired map fidelity . since there will always be reconstruction errors on scales approaching the skewer separation , @xmath6 , due to the finite transverse sampling ( ` aliasing ' ) , the individual spectra do not need to oversample the absorption along the los . in simulated reconstructions using noisy mock data",
    ", we found that @xmath22 per @xmath23 at a survey limit of @xmath24 is sufficient to give tomographic maps that look similar to the ` true ' simulated field on scales of @xmath25 .",
    "this is achievable with existing telescopes : e.g. with the vlt - vimos spectrograph @xcite such data would require 6hr exposure times per pointing .",
    "the requirements do increase if we desire greater spatial resolutions : ly@xmath0  forest tomography resolving @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath27kpc physical at @xmath28 ) would require @xmath29 background galaxies , which are accessible only with future 30m - class telescopes .",
    "in march 2014 , we obtained moderate - resolution ( @xmath30 ) spectra of 24 sfgs at redshifts @xmath31 , down to limiting magnitudes of @xmath32 , using the lris spectrograph on the keck i telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "these sfgs were all within a @xmath33 area of the cosmos field @xcite , resulting in an effective area density of @xmath34 or a nominal transverse separation of @xmath35 .",
    "the data was taken with @xmath36hr exposure times resulting in @xmath37 per pixel .",
    "it may seem aggressive to use such noisy data , but our tomographic reconstruction uses a wiener filtering algorithm @xcite that incorporates noise - weighting .",
    "another concern is the possible contamination by intrinsic sfg absorption lines , but studies of composite sfg spectra @xcite have revealed a relative lack of strong intrinsic absorption lines in the relevant @xmath38 restframe region once the foreground ly@xmath0  forest fluctuations are averaged out by stacking .",
    "moreover , uv spectroscopic observations of a small number of low-@xmath39 sfgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the ly@xmath0  forest is negligible , have revealed a relatively flat ` continuum ' , with only 2 - 3 strong absorbers that are straightforward to mask .",
    "this is supported by the high - resolution spectrum of the the lensed sfg cb158 , which allowed voigt - profile analysis of the absorbers in its ly@xmath0  forest region @xcite .",
    "forest tomographic map obtained from the foreground absorption in 24 background sfg spectra , split into 3 different redshift segments for clarity .",
    "the color scale represents the relative ly@xmath0  absorption , such that lower values correspond to higher densities .",
    "excerpted from @xcite . ]    in figure  1 we show the resulting 3d tomographic ly@xmath0  forest reconstruction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spanning @xmath40 with a spatial resolution of @xmath25 . the elongated map geometry is because bad weather limited us to a small transverse area , whereas each sightline probes a long pathlength @xmath41 along the los .    despite the narrow geometry",
    ", one sees large coherent structures spanning @xmath42 across the entire transverse dimension .",
    "these structures are contributed by multiple sightlines and are therefore unlikely to be due to random noise fluctuations nor intrinsic absorption ( since the background sfg redshifts are not aligned ) .",
    "simulated reconstructions on mock data with the exact same spatial sampling and s / n distribution yield a good recovery of lss features on scales of a few mpc , although there are distortions on smaller scales .",
    "we also compared the map with a small number of coeval galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts ( primarily from zcosmos , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that the galaxies live preferentially in lower - flux regions ( i.e. overdensities ) , although this correlation is weakened somewhat by redshift errors on the coeval galaxies and tomographic reconstruction errors .",
    "our pilot observations have established the feasibility of ly@xmath0  forest tomography , and motivates the cosmos lyman - alpha mapping and tomography observations ( clamato ) survey , which aims to obtain @xmath43 sfg spectra within @xmath44 of the cosmos field , aimed at creating a tomographic reconstruction of the ly@xmath0  forest absorption at @xmath45 over a comoving volume equivalent to @xmath46 .",
    "this survey will require @xmath47 nights of large - telescope time , and will have various science applications : * ( i ) * the large - scale morphology and topology of the cosmic web has never been studied at @xmath48 , and the tomographic map will allow us to study this on scales of @xmath49 . *",
    "( ii ) * using ly@xmath0  forest absorption as a proxy for the underlying density field , we will be able to study the properties of @xmath50 coeval galaxies as a function of their large - scale environment , yielding unique insights into this crucial era in galaxy formation and evolution . *",
    "( iii ) * within the volume covered by the map , we expect to find @xmath51 progenitors of massive @xmath52 galaxy clusters . at @xmath53 ,",
    "these protoclusters are expected to manifest themselves as overdensities of a few on spanning @xmath54 ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which should be easily detectable with ly@xmath0  forest tomography .",
    "finally , * ( iv ) * the data will allow us to probe 3d small - scale ly@xmath0  forest clustering on scales of @xmath55 , complementary to the larger scales probed by the boss survey @xcite .",
    "these measurements will be valuable in arriving at a comprehensive model of the ly@xmath0  forest absorption .",
    "clamato survey , compared with the true 3d absorption field ( left ) .",
    "both fields have an effective smoothing of @xmath56 .",
    "the simulated survey data clearly recovers the lss in the volume .",
