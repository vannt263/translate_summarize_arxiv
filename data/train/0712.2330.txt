    "we consider the nature of the minimizers for a class of 1d free - energy functionals that model the continuum limit of microscopic systems with competing interactions on different length scales .",
    "an example is a spin system on a lattice with a nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction and a long range antiferromagnetic power law type interaction . in @xcite",
    "we considered the ground states of such systems in one - dimension and in @xcite we also investigated higher dimensional models with dipolar type interactions . in both cases we obtained periodic ground states whose period ( which could be infinite ) depended on both the strength of the short range interaction and the nature of the long range interaction .",
    "the technique used in those papers , reflection positivity , could not be extended to positive temperatures , for which only approximate methods and computer simulations are available now @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that these reflection positivity methods are directly applicable to the ginzburg - landau type free - energy functionals used to describe the continuum versions of such microscopic systems @xcite .",
    "these include finite temperature effects , at least at a mean field level , via an inclusion of a local entropy term in the effective continuum description of the system .",
    "these free - energies functionals have been used extensively in both the physical and mathematical literatures as models for a great variety of systems , including micromagnets @xcite , diblock copolymers @xcite , anisotropic electron gases @xcite , polyelectrolytes @xcite , charge - density waves in layered transition metals @xcite and superconducting films @xcite .",
    "many of these systems are characterized by low temperature phases displaying spontaneous formation of periodic mesoscopic patterns , such as stripes or bubbles .",
    "it is , therefore , important to show that these free energy functionals have periodic minimizers .",
    "this has been proved rigorously in some cases @xcite and argued for heuristically in others @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use reflection positivity methods to prove the periodicity of minimizers for a certain class of such 1d free - energy functionals .",
    "these include cases that were not treated before , e.g. , those with long - range power law type interactions .",
    "as noted before , reflection positivity methods have been succesfully applied to find periodic ground states for a class of microscopic 1d and 2d lattice spin models but has not , as far as we know , been used before for continuum systems .",
    "we begin in section [ two ] by presenting the class of models under consideration and our results .",
    "these are proved in section [ three ] . in section",
    "[ four ] we give an example of the transition from a state of finite periodicity to a uniform ( infinite periodicity ) state , as a parameter is varied .",

    "the long range positive definite kac potential , with @xmath298 , will lead to a strictly convex @xmath295 .",
    "this means that the global phase segregation , due to the short range interaction , is destroyed by the long range positive definite kac potential in the limit @xmath299 .",
    "the interpretation given in @xcite was that there is no phase separation on the scale @xmath300 , but non trivial structures may appear on an intermediate scale @xmath301 . in this sense",
    "the system for finite , but small , @xmath302 is expected to be a sort of froth , with structures invisible on large scales , but observable on intermediate scales ( and these structures may form periodic patterns , as discussed in the introduction ) . while the scale @xmath303 is unknown in general , our results on microscopic models show that , at least in 1d lattice models , the correct scale to look at , at zero temperature , is @xmath304 , see @xcite and the discussion in section viii of @xcite .    the problem of understanding these mesoscopic structures can be related to the minimization problem studied in this paper , thanks to a result by gates and penrose @xcite , who proved that the free energy @xmath295 can also be obtained from a minimization of a free energy functional similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) , but without a gradient term .",
    "such functional has the interpretation of large deviation functional for observing a mesoscopic density @xcite .",
    "as already noted , the absence of a gradient term in this functional means that its minimizers ( the `` typical mesoscopic configurations '' ) will oscillate on a scale small compared to @xmath300 , e.g. , the @xmath304 found in @xcite .",
