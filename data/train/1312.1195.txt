    "the wlc model has been applied to different kinds of biopolymers like dnas and microtubules , and has successfully explained various experimentally observed behaviors of long polymer chains , such as the force - extension relation ( e.g. , marko _ _ et al.__@xcite ) that is frequently measured in single - molecule experiments ( e.g. , smith _ _ et al.__@xcite ) , the moments of the end - to - end distance distribution for a free chain ( e.g. , schurr _ _ et al.__@xcite ) , to name some of them .",

    "now we consider when an external force field that corresponds to a potential @xmath24 is applied .",
    "examples of such force fields include the case when the system is stretched by a single force at one end with the other end fixed or when it is immersed in a constant plug flow with one end fixed . in the single force stretching case , the potential energy can be written as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the magnitude of the force and @xmath27 is the displacement of the free end relative to the fixed end in the force direction .",
    "when we put the potential @xmath28 into the wlc model , the energy now reads :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the component of the unit tangent vector of the curve @xmath0 in the force direction .",
    "previous studies of such a system primarily focused on the relations between the average end - to - end distance or extension @xmath27 as a function of the force applied@xcite .",

    "the final analytical expression of @xmath31 also depends on the boundary conditions we choose . in our case , since the spectrins form the wall of the tube of axons , without further experimental observations , it is natural to assume that the spectrins bind to actin rings with a right angle .",

    "here we demonstrate how we can apply the results to experimental observations and obtain the information of local configurations of the axonal cytoskeleton .",
    "the example we are interested in here is the recent observation of the 1-dimensional periodic structure in the axonal cytoskeleton @xcite . in such a structure ,",
    "the axonal cytoskeleton resembles a hose tube periodically supported by rings that are formed by actins .",
    "adjacent rings are connected by bundles of spectrin tetramers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : axon ] ( a ) ) .",
    "however , little is known about the dynamics of the spectrins in such a network and how the interactions between spectrins and other components of the cell ( such as the membrane ) affect the elastic properties of the cytoskeleton .",
    "here we focus on how the spectrins between two adjacent actin rings fluctuate relative to each other .",
    "two simple but different assumptions are considered .",
    "one assumption is that the spectrins in the same period fluctuate in sync ( fig .",
    "[ fig : axon](b ) ) .",
    "mathematically this means that for any two spectrins between the same pair of actin rings , we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 where the subscripts @xmath77 and @xmath78 differentiate the two spectrins in the same period .",
    "the physical consequence of this assumption is that now we can consider the spectrins in one spatial period as a bundle , which behaves like a single chain with a new effective bending rigidity @xmath79 .",
    "since they bend in the same way , the bending energy of the bundle will be @xmath80 times that of a single spectrin , where @xmath80 is the total number of spectrins in the bundle .",
    "thus we have @xmath81 and hence an effective persistence length for the bundle @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the bending rigidity and persistence length of one single spectrin tetramer respectively .",
    "the other assumption is that even though the ends on each side of the spectrins are held relatively fixed to each other , they can fluctuate independently in between ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : axon](b ) ) . in this case , the entropy increases linearly with the number of spectrins .",
    "thus with an increasing number of spectrins , the stronger entropic effect implies a shorter effective persistence length .",
    "later we will show that the experimental observations support the first assumption .",
    "in both cases , we assume that the spectrins have the same contour length @xmath63 . to make a quantitative comparison with the experiment",
    ", we further assume that the spectrins have a fixed connection with the actins with a right angle , and the forces acting on the spectrins can be effectively considered as from the actin rings at the ends and the average direction of the forces are perpendicular to the rings .",
    "we also assume that the planes of the actins are parallel to each other , which implies that the spacing between adjacent rings represents the end - to - end distance of the spectrins in the force direction .",
    "the experimental measurements@xcite suggest that the average end - to - end distance projected to the force direction is about @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "this is close to the contour length of the spectrin tetramer ( @xmath87 @xmath86 ) @xcite , and we expect that our calculation in the strong - stretching limit should apply",
    ". some of the assumptions may not seem obvious without further experimental data .",
    "our point here is to demonstrate how the analytical results can be applied to both the single molecule and cytoskeleton levels to infer the dynamics of the components in the cytoskeletal network",
    ". the limitations of those assumptions will be discussed in the next section .",
    "using the experimentally measured average spacing @xmath85 @xmath86 as @xmath74 and the variance of the spacing @xmath88 @xmath89 as @xmath70 , a relationship between the contour length @xmath63 and the effective persistence length @xmath72 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment-1 ] ( b ) using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noforce-1 ] ) .",
    "this curve represents a constraint that is put on the possible values of @xmath63 and @xmath72 by experimental measurements .",
    "it shows that if we use a contour length of spectrins around @xmath90 @xmath86 , then the experimental measurements predict an effective persistence length of the axon cytoskeleton much larger than the persistence length of single spectrin that is only around @xmath91",
    " @xmath92 @xmath86 .",
    "thus experimental observations support the first assumption that the spectrins fluctuate in - sync in one spatial period .",
    "the reason of this dynamics is unknown and probably has its root in the interaction between spectrins and other components in the cell , such as the membrane or the microtubules . to further check",
    "if this in - sync - fluctuation assumption is consistent with experiments , we use the contour length @xmath63 and the persistence length @xmath64 for single spectrins from literatures@xcite and the measured average extension@xcite @xmath93 @xmath86 to predict the variance @xmath65 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noforce-1 ] ) ( table [ table1 ] ) . to get the effective persistence length @xmath72",
    ", we make a rather rough estimation of @xmath94 as an approximated total number of spectrins between two adjacent actin rings .",
    "experiments suggest that @xmath80 is the order of @xmath91 , and since we are only checking the consistency here , slightly varying the value of @xmath80 will not affect the results shown in table [ table1 ] qualitatively .",

    "we assume @xmath94 as the approximated total number of spectrins in one spatial period and use @xmath93 @xmath86 for the average extension@xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference in the predicted fluctuations @xmath65 in table [ table1 ] is probably due to different experiment or simulation setups .",
    "but more importantly , table [ table1 ] shows that the experimentally observed variance ( @xmath95 @xmath86)@xmath96 falls between the fluctuations predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noforce-1 ] ) , implying the consistency between the experiments and our model assumptions .",
    "we can also reproduce the variance of @xmath97(@xmath95 @xmath86)@xmath96 with parameters very similar to those in literatures ( for example , using @xmath98 @xmath86 , @xmath99 @xmath86 , @xmath94 , and @xmath93 @xmath86 , we get @xmath100 @xmath86)@xmath96 according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noforce-1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , without introducing further complexity or more subtle mechanism , we demonstrate that combining the relations between extensions and fluctuations at both the single molecule and cytoskeleton levels help us understand more about the dynamics of spectrins in the axonal cytoskeleton .",
    "although we can not rule out other possibilities , here we use the theoretical results to provide a possible simple explanation to the experimentally observed longitudinal fluctuations in the axonal cytoskeleton .",
    "several topics deserve further discussions here .",
    "first of all , when we apply our analytical results to the specific experiments of axonal cytoskeletons , the details of the interactions between the cytoskeleton and other components of the axon are ignored .",
    "however , the conclusion that the assumption of in - sync fluctuations of the spectrin tetramers , as one of possible configurations , is self - consistent may imply that the averaged effect of those interactions at leading order is to keep the spectrins fluctuates in sync .",
    "here we consider that the experimentally measured fluctuations is purely caused by the thermal fluctuations of the spectrins .",
    "but in reality , the fluctuations observed should include contributions from all aspects , and only set an upper bound for the thermal fluctuations of spectrins . in this paper",
    ", we used a largely simplified setup to demonstrate the idea of how the macroscopic elastic properties of a coarse - grained chain put constraints on its local dynamics and obtained a self - consistent result .",
    "a more subtle modeling will definitely be useful with future experimental support .",
    "it should be noted again that we can not rule out other possibilities solely using the theory , but the conclusion here may provide some hints of what to look for in future investigations .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the system we studied corresponds to an isotensional ensemble ( or gibbs ensemble ) .",
    "its counter part is the isometric ensemble ( or helmholtz ensemble ) , in which the end - to - end distance is fixed a constant and the force fluctuates .",
    "the equivalence of these two ensembles are discussed in previous studies@xcite , especially in the thermodynamic limit . in a biological system , such as the axon cytoskeleton",
    ", one would expect both the end - to - end distances and the forces fluctuate . at current stage",
    ", the differences between the two ensembles for systems with finite length will not alter our conclusion here .",
    "but a realization of the isometric ensemble and more precise experimental measurements will determine the more appropriate boundary conditions _ in vivo_.    here we studied the relations between the extensions and fluctuations when a slender object is stretched at the end .",
    "it will be intriguing to understand such relations in a more general setup .",
    "examples include the case when the system is influenced by external flows or electric fields .",
    "experimental , numerical , and analytical studies have been performed in this direction ( e.g. , perkins _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , smith _ _ et al.__@xcite , manca _ _ et al.__@xcite , and yang _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "stretching polymers using external fields is also an crucial technique in manipulating single molecules @xcite . in future studies",
    ", we will focus on how our approaches presented here can help understand the dynamics of biopolymer networks influenced by external fields .    as a goal for longer terms",
    ", we would like to know how the local structures and dynamics are related to the specific functions of certain biological systems .",
    "for example , for the axonal cytoskeleton , similar structures have been noticed in different situations , such as the skeleton of snakes or the structure of hoses . as an analogy to those structures , in neuron cells",
    ", the periodic actin rings may provide support against the bending or transverse compression of the axons .",
    "but it deserves further investigations to understand how the axon benefits from the specific structure of the actin - spectrin network .",
    "if the actin - spectrin network helps stabilize the membrane , then we can ask whether the spacing between and the radius of the ring ( or the ratio between these two ) observed experimentally correspond to an optimal solution of a certain underlying mechanism , such as the buckling instability . from a physicist s perspective , if similar cytoskeletal structure exists in other organisms , it will be more intriguing to see weather the ratio between the ring s spacing and radius is universal across different organisms .",
    "if the answer is yes , then it is natural to ask what mechanism dictates this ratio .    finally ,",
    "although we specifically apply our results to the axonal cytoskeleton , our derivations are based on a slightly more general setup .",
    "we expect that our results may facilitate the study of other biological or physical structures where the composited system can be coarse - grained as a single smooth curve . on the other hand , in this paper we treat the fluctuations as purely thermal .",
    "but it is known that , in a living cell , the dynamical process is rather active with energy input ( e.g. , from atp ) and dissipation ( e.g. , kim _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "so _ in vivo _ , the configurational fluctuations may be affected by the energy input rate , such as the atp concentration .",
    "however , the same approach applied in this paper may also be used in such an active system .",
    "given the observed fluctuations and the elastic properties of the components , the details of the active process may be revealed ( e.g. , kim _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "to conclude , we investigated the interplay between the macroscopic properties of a composited system , the elasticity of its components and their local dynamics .",
    "we focus on slender systems that can be coarse - grained as linear curves . a generic model for such systems",
    "was introduced based on the fundamental theorem of curves .",
    "this model provides an alternative view of the well - known wlc model from a mathematical perspective and supports the applications of the wlc model at different scales , ranging from single molecules to complex networks .",
    "then we applied the wlc model to both axonal cytoskeletons and individual spectrins , one component of the axonal cytoskeletons .",
    "different from previous studies that primarily focus on the relations between forces and polymer conformations , we utilized the relations between the fluctuations and average extensions to understand the experiments where the force was not measured .",
    "combining such relations on both the spectrin and the cytoskeleton levels suggest a simple but self - consistent local dynamics of spectrins , in which all the spectrins in one spatial period in the axonal cytoskeleton fluctuate in - sync .",
    "although the validity of this dynamics requires further experimental and theoretical investigations , we used it as one example that shows how we can apply the wlc model or relevant models at different scales of slender systems and extract information from the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental observations .",
