    "the reddening of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) by dust grains is one of the largest uncertainties that limit the current precision of the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reddening laws along lines of sight to sne ia are generally measured through the total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the extinction in @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands , respectively . from the analyses of numerous samples of sne ia ,",
    "many studies suggest that , to minimize the residual on the hubble diagram , @xmath13 toward sne ia must be in a range of @xmath0 1.02.0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is considerably lower than the range @xmath0 2.25.5 measured in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "the origin of such unusually low @xmath13 thus has been an important issue to be resolved for the applicability of sne ia as the cosmic standard candles .",
    "the multi - band observations of individual sne ia also seem to commonly show the values as low as @xmath14 ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) , although there is one study suggesting that weakly reddened sne ia have the values similar to the average @xmath15 in the mw @xcite .",
    "for these nearby sne ia , not only @xmath13 but also the extinction curves , namely the wavelength - dependence of extinction , can be obtained from optical to near - infrared photometries and spectra .",
    "the derived extinction curves are much steeper than the mw average extinction curve and are nicely fitted with the one - parameter formula given in @xcite by taking @xmath16 1.02.0 .",
    "such non - standard extinction laws indicate that the properties of interstellar dust in host galaxies of sne ia are different from those in the mw or that other environmental effects associated with sne ia affect the apparent shapes of extinction curves .",
    "one of the possible processes that have been suggested as provoking the steep extinction curves is the multiple scattering by dust grains surrounding sne ia ; it has been shown that multiple scattering of photons in a circumstellar dust shell with a visual optical depth of @xmath17 can substantially steepen the extinction curve ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also nagao , maeda , & nozawa , 2016 ) .",
    "however , if there exist such a moderately optically thick dust shell , we also expect thermal emission from the circumstellar dust that is heated by the sn radiation ( so - called infrared light echo ) .",
    "@xcite observed three nearby sne ia with _",
    "herschel _ but did not detect any far - infrared emission .",
    "@xcite also reported the non - detection with _ spitzer _ at 3.6 @xmath6 m and 4.5 @xmath6 m for several sne ia and placed the mass limit of @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 on the amount of the circumstellar dust .",
    "furthermore , by comparing an infrared light echo model and near - infrared observations of sne ia samples , @xcite put the upper limits of @xmath21 on the @xmath12-band optical depths of circumstellar dust shells .",
    "these works point out that there would not be massive dust shells around sne ia so that the multiple scattering by local dust might not be a valid explanation of the unusual extinction laws .",
    "recently , type ia sn 2014j was discovered in the starburst galaxy m82 at a distance of @xmath22 3.5 mpc @xcite , which is the nearest among sne ia reported in the last thirty years . this sn is highly reddened and thus offer the best opportunity to study the extinction property on its sightline .",
    "the extensive observations have revealed that the extinction curve derived for sn 2014j is highly steep with a very low value of @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from a simultaneous fit to the extinction and polarization data , @xcite claim that both interstellar and circumstellar dust are responsible for the anomalous extinction property toward sn 2014j .",
    "however , the time invariability of the color @xcite and polarization @xcite indicates that its peculiar extinction is mainly of interstellar - dust origin .",
    "this seems to be also supported by non - detection of infrared excess , which otherwise would be caused by the circumstellar dust shell around sn 2014j @xcite .",
    "these studies above provide an increasing number of evidence that the unusual extinction curves toward sne ia are likely to be originated by interstellar dust in their host galaxies .",
    "hence , the extinction curves measured for sne ia can be powerful tools for probing the properties of interstellar dust in external galaxies . in general , a low @xmath13 is interpreted as corresponding to a smaller average radius of dust than that in the mw .",
    "@xcite searched for a physical model of relevant dust grains via the fitting to the measured color - excess curve of sn 2014j and found that their size distribution is biased to small radii relative to that in the mw .",
    "however , it has not been systematically investigated how small the interstellar dust should be , to produce the steep extinction curves appeared for sne ia . as stated above , the extinction laws toward sne ia",
    "are well described by the extinction curves derived from the empirical formula by @xcite ( which we , hereafter , refer to as the ccm curves ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we aim to comprehensively understand what composition and size distribution of interstellar dust can reproduce the ccm curves with exceptionally low values of @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , the procedure of the fitting calculations and the model of dust used for deriving the extinction curves are described .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in section [ sec : results ] and discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , our main conclusions are remarked . throughout this",
    "paper , dust grains are assumed to be spherical .",
    "the main aim of this study is to explore how a variety of the ccm curves described by different @xmath13 can translate to the properties of interstellar dust . in order to do this",
    ", we perform the calculations of fitting to the ccm curves by applying a simple dust model",
    ". however , we do not try to fit the whole shape of the ccm curve by finely spacing wavelengths from 0.125 @xmath6 m to 3.5 @xmath6 m under consideration .",
    "indeed , the continuous ccm curves have been derived by interpolating the data of extinction obtained from ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra and optical to near - infrared photometries @xcite .",
    "given that the extinction curves are usually extracted on the basis of photometric observations , it is practical to consider the extinction at the specific wavelengths where the observational data are available .",
    "in this study , we take , as the reference wavelengths , the effective wavelengths of widely - used optical to near - infrared photometric filters and wide - band uv photometric filters onboard representative satellites such as _ habble space telescope ( hst ) _ , _ galex _ , and _",
    "swift_. table 1 presents the reference wavelengths @xmath25 adopted in this study . at these wavelengths , we calculate the extinction values @xmath26 normalized to that in @xmath11 band for different @xmath13 by means of the ccm formula and use them as the data of extinction curves to be fitted .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from this motivation , we do the fitting calculations for the data sets that do not include the wavelengths ( @xmath27 3.05.2 @xmath6m@xmath28 ) around the 2175   bump ( but still include the two far - uv wavelengths at @xmath27 6.5 and 8.0 @xmath6m@xmath28 ) . for purposes of illustration ,",
    "we here focus on the dust models with power - law size distributions . as been done before , we evaluate the goodness of fitting with equation ( [ eq : dispers2 ] ) , for which @xmath29 with the five data around the uv bump being excluded .    table [ tab : nouv ] presents the best - fit parameters obtained from the fitting calculations that do not take account of the data around the uv bump for some dust models considered in this study .",
    "the corresponding extinction curves are shown in figure [ fig : nonuv](a ) and [ fig : nonuv](b ) for @xmath30 and 1.5 , respectively .",
    "we can see that , when we assume @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( referred to as model 1nb ) , the best - fit combinations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , even if the uv - bump data are not considered , are chosen so that the resulting extinction curves have a prominent 2175   bump like those from model 1 , which do not neglect the uv - bump data .",
    "this seems that the data near 2175   may be insignificant in extracting the properties of dust from the measured extinction curves .",
    "however , this is not true ; when we parameterize all of the five quantities ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath34 ) relevant to the power - law size distribution ( referred to as model 5nb ) , the best - fit models yield a much weaker 2175   bump for both @xmath30 and 1.5 . in particular ,",
    "the result without the uv - bump data for @xmath30 prefers a highly silicate - dominated dust composition ( @xmath39 , compared to the nominal range of @xmath40 0.40.6 ) , indicating that the data around the 2175   bump are essential for determining the mass fraction of graphite .",
    "in addition , if we do not include the data at uv wavelengths shorter than 0.3 @xmath6 m , distinct extinction curves appear even in the case of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( referred to as model 1nu for which @xmath41 without the seven data in uv regions ) . as seen from figure [",
    "fig : nonuv ] , the extinction curves from model 1nu for @xmath42 2.0 and 1.5 well reproduce the extinction data at @xmath43 3.0 @xmath6m@xmath28 .",
    "however , at @xmath44 @xmath6m@xmath28 , these extinction curves do not resemble to their corresponding ones from model 1 ; the uv extinction curve for @xmath42 2.0 shows a less prominent 2175   bump because of a smaller abundance of graphite ( @xmath45 ) , whereas the best fit for @xmath42 1.5 requires a very high abundance of graphite ( @xmath46 ) , resulting in an extremely conspicuous uv bump .",
    "these analyses clearly demonstrate that , despite using the same extinction data at optical to near - infrared wavelengths , the different results come out depending on whether the uv extinction data are taken into account or not .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the extinction data at uv wavelengths are crucial for reliablely assessing the composition and size distribution of interstellar dust from the measured extinction curves .",
    "we have investigated the properties of interstellar dust responsible for the peculiar extinction laws with @xmath0 1.02.0 measured toward type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "we perform the fitting calculations to the measured extinction curves , for which we adopt the extinction values at the reference wavelengths derived with the empirical one - parameter formula by @xcite . as a dust model for calculating the extinction curves",
    ", we consider a two - component model composed of graphite and silicate with power - law and lognormal size distributions .",
    "we first confirm that our dust model can reproduce the extinction curves with @xmath47 that is taken to be a typical value in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "then , we find that even the simplest dust model with the power index of @xmath31 can account for the entire shapes of steep extinction curves described by @xmath30 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 with appropriate combinations of the maximum cut - off radius @xmath33 and mass ratio of graphite to silicate @xmath34 . in particular , @xmath33 is found to be an important quantity to describe the variety of extinction curves , and decreases from @xmath220.24 @xmath6 m for @xmath47 down to @xmath220.06 @xmath6 m for @xmath48 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath34 takes a relatively narrow range of @xmath220.40.6 , indicating the mass ratio of graphite to silicate is not changed dramatically for different @xmath49 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the lognormal grain size distribution can also work well in reproducing the ccm curves with @xmath42 1.03.1 by taking the very small characteristic radius @xmath50 and relatively large standard deviation @xmath51 of the distribution .",
    "furthermore , from the comparison of the average grain radii between the best - fit power - law and lognormal size distributions , we suggest that the average radius is not a proper quantity as representing the properties of dust that explains the extinction curves . finally , we point out that the extinction data at a limited range of wavelengths , such as a single value of @xmath13 , do not allow us to uniquely determine the properties of dust , and that the extinction data over a wide range of wavelengths including the uv data are essential for constraining the composition and size distribution of interstellar dust .",
    "our main conclusion is that , in order to explain the steep extinction curves suggested for sne ia , the size distribution of interstellar dust in their host galaxies is biased to small sizes , compared to that in the mw . since sne",
    "ia are known to happen in any types of galaxies , this implies that large grains ( @xmath52 @xmath53 0.1 @xmath6 m ) are lacking in galaxies other than the mw .",
    "why are the sizes of interstellar dust so small in external galaxies ?",
    "this may presuppose that the evolution history of the mw is somehow different from the other galaxies so that the interstellar dust in the mw has the exceptional properties .",
    "there is also a possibility that the measured extinction curves do not reflect pure extinction but are distorted by other effects such as contamination of scattered lights at shorter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite showed that small silicate grains and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are needed for producing a low @xmath13 through multiple scattering .",
    "hence , this possibility may require that the host galaxies of sne ia contain abundant small silicate grains and pahs .",
    "another possibility is that something is amiss in the process of extracting the extinction curves from the observations of sne ia . given that sne ia are ideal objects to measure the extinction curves in external galaxies , these subjects should be addressed from both observational and theoretical points of view .",
    "we thank the anonymous referees for their careful reading and useful comments , which highly improved the paper .",
    "i also thank takashi kozasa for kindly providing me with the computational resources to do the fitting calculations in this study .",
