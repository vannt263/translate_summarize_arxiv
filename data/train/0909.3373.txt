    "the formulation are presented in appendix .",
    "in this paper we studied the twist of various swcnts and of mwcnts made of monochiral carbon layers , in which the interlayer distance is taken to be about 0.34 nm .",
    "the twisting angle @xmath22 is the angle between the initial position of the outer wall and its deformed position , after an imposed rotation angle at the free end , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] .",
    "we next consider the surface change during the twisting .",
    "we observed that periodic buckling waves appear on the tube surface when a tube is largely twisted .",
    "the change of the helical shape of the cnt surface depends on the tube radius .",
    "[ fig : twist ] . shows the different shapes of three twisted chiral cnts prior to fracture .",
    "we can see that the buckling period is longer for big tubes than for the small one .",
    "furthermore , we find that the length of each buckling period depends on the twisting angle and the tube radius . in our simulation ,",
    "the time step between each imposed deformation is taken to be long enough ( 10000 step / degree ) for letting the tubes have enough time to adapt to the new deformation at one end .",
    "we note that , if we apply the deformation with a higher rate ( e.g. some degrees per _ ps _ ) , the fracture would occur earlier and the buckling shape of the surface could be different .",
    "considering that the surface twisting can significantly change the electronic properties of the tube @xcite , we present in fig . [",
    "fig : cross ] different shapes of the cross section of a tube twisted to several twist angles .",
    "it can be seen that the section remains circular when the deformation is relatively small .",
    "however , it deforms to an ellipse when the deformation becomes important . then , with increasing twisting angle , this ellipse section rotates around the tube axis with an angular momentum following the direction of deformation applied to the tube end .",
    "how much twist deformation can a cnt sustain ? to answer this question , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fracture ] , we show the fracture of a twisted swcnt .",

    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : utr ] the ultimate value of the twist ratio ( utr ) for 9 swcnts of a same length but with different radii and chiralities .",
    "it can be seen that the utr of the small tubes is clearly higher than that of the big ones .",
    "we can also see that the utr of the zigzag tubes decreases faster than that of the armchair tubes with increasing tube radius .",
    "we can conclude that a big tube can resist better to twist than a small one .    to show further effect of the tube geometry",
    ", we define the deformation energy of the tube as the change of the total potential energy of the cnt .",
    "it is an important factor coupled to the tube s elastic constant .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : ener ] the torsion energy as a function of the twist ratio .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ener ] ( a ) that the deformation energy of a big tube increases faster than that of a small one , while the ultimate value of the deformation energy for a big tube is lower than that for a small one . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ener ] ( b ) .",
    "we use the tubes of similar radii and lengths to show that the deformation energy is almost independent of the tube chirality .",
    "the increase ratio of deformation energy of the zigzag tube is slightly higher than that of the chiral and the armchair ones .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the average axial bond strength of a zigzag swcnt is slightly higher than that of other tubes with similar sizes but differing chiralities @xcite .",
    "we study also the twist of multi - walled cnts ( mwcnts ) , as demonstratiod in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwcnt ] .",
    "it shows from two positions of observation how an armchair mwcnt breaks under twist .",
    "we can see the appearance of buckling waves in both the inner and outer layers when the tube is deformed , while the fracture occurs first at the outer layer after the appearance of defects on its surface .",
    "we show the ultimate twist ratio of mwcnts in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the utr decreases with the number of carbon layers .",
    "the deformation energy of a zigzag mwcnt is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwcnt2 ] ( a ) .",
    "we can see that the energy per atom of the outer layer during the deformation is much higher than that of the inner layer .",
    "this can explain why the tubes are always broken from the outer layer when they are largely twisted .",
    "we can also see that the the van der waals interaction does not play a very important role in the total deformation energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwcnt2 ] ( b ) .",
    "we can see the corresponding image of the failure of the twisted tube .",
    "in summary , the twist of cnts has been simulated by using the md method based on the airebo potential .",
    "surface transition from zigzag or armchair to chiral type and periodic buckling waves were observed in our simulations .",
    "we also observed the creation of defects and the fracture on the tube surface .",
    "the cross section of swcnts is found to become an elliptic and rotates around the tube center axis when the deformation is large enough .",
    "we calculated the ultimate value of the twist ratio and the deformation energy for several types of cnts with different geometries .",
    "we find that the small tubes can be twisted more than the big ones .",
