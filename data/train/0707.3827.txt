    "bulk silicon is an indirect band - gap material emitting in the infrared region .",
    "radiative lifetimes of excited carrier are very long , causing a predominant de - excitation via fast non - radiative recombinations .",
    "moreover , silicon has a significant free carrier absorption and auger recombination rates which makes the use of this material in optoelectronic applications very problematic .    during the last decade ,",
    "several breakthroughs have increased the hopes of using nanostructured silicon as an optical active material.@xcite the basic idea has been to take advantage of the reduced dimensionality of the nanocrystalline phase ( 1 - 5 nm in size ) where quantum confinement , band folding and surface effects play a crucial role.@xcite indeed , it has been found that si nanocrystals band - gap increases with decreasing size with a luminescence external efficiency in excess of 23%.@xcite moreover , optical gain has been already demonstrated in a large variety of experimental conditions.@xcite nevertheless , si nanocrystals ( si - nc ) still have a memory of the indirect band gap of the bulk phase and this is evidenced by the clearly observed structures related to momentum - conserving phonons.@xcite this drawback can be circumvented by introducing an isoelectronic impurities .",
    "@xcite indeed , in a series of recent very interesting papers , fujii and collaborators @xcite have proved the possibility of a detailed control of the si - nc photoluminescence by the simultaneous doping with _ n_- and _ p_- type impurities .",
    "in particular , they have showed that a ( b and p ) codoped si - nc always has an higher photoluminescence intensity than that of both a single ( b or p ) doped and of an undoped nanocrystal . besides , under resonant excitation condition , the codoped samples did not exhibit structures related to momentum - conserving phonons suggesting that , in this case , the quasi - direct optical transitions are predominant.@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , investigations of impurities in silicon nanostructures are very few when compared to the large number of papers reporting calculations for pure , undoped systems ; moreover , most of them are based on semi - empirical approaches .",
    "an handful number of first - principles studies has been devoted to quantum confinement effects in single - doped si - nc.@xcite these works have basically shown that i ) the si - nc ionization energy is virtually size independent , ii ) the impurity formation energy is greater for smaller nanocrystals and iii ) impurity segregation strongly affects the conductance properties of nanostructures.@xcite    we have recently started a systematic study of the electronic and optical properties of codoped si - nc .",
    "our first results @xcite show that codoped si - nc undergo a minor structural distortion around the impurities and that the formation energies are always smaller than those of the corresponding single - doped cases .",
    "moreover , we have found that codoping reduces the band - gap with respect to the undoped nanocrystals , showing the possibility of an impurity based engineering of the si - nc optical properties.@xcite    we report here a comprehensive theoretical study of the structural , electronic and optical properties of b and p simultaneously doped si nanocrystals using _ ab initio _ density functional theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ comp ] is focused on the description of the theoretical and computational methods , section [ res ] is dedicated to the discussion of our results .",
    "the results will be presented and discussed in the following order : i ) structural properties ( subsection [ geometri ] ) , ii ) formation energies ( subsection [ forme ] ) and iii ) electronic ( subsection [ elpr ] ) and iv ) optical properties ( subsection [ opti ] ) for all the considered si nanocrystals . concerning the optical properties we discuss both absorption and emission spectra obtained within a single - particle approach ( [ abs ] ) and , in one case , with many - body methods considering self - energy corrections and the bethe - salpeter scheme ( [ lum ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our results .",
    "our results are obtained within a plane - wave pseudopotential dft scheme , using the quantum - espresso package @xcite .",
    "the impurity states are calculated in an approximately spherical si - nc , built by considering all the bulk si atoms contained in a sphere ( centered on a si ion ) with a diameter ranging from 1.1 nm ( si@xmath0h@xmath1 ) to 1.79 nm ( si@xmath2h@xmath3 ) .",
    "the surface dangling bonds are saturated with hydrogens . following the work of fujii et al .",
    "@xcite , we have located the b and p impurities in substitutional positions just below the nanocrystal surface .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this arrangement represents the most stable configuration , as confirmed by theoretical and experimental works.@xcite full relaxation with respect to the atomic positions has been allowed for both doped and undoped systems .",
    "all the dft calculations are performed within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using vanderbilt ultrasoft @xcite pseudopotentials for the determination of both the structural and electronic properties ( see sec .",
    "[ geometri ] , sec .",
    "[ forme ] and sec .",
    "[ elpr ] ) whereas norm - conserving pseudopotential within the local density approximation ( lda ) at the relaxed geometry have been used to evaluate the optical properties ( see sec .",
    "[ opti ] ) .",
    "this choice is due to the fact that although vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials allow the treatment of several hundreds of atoms per unit cell in the atomic relaxation process , the removal of the norm - conservation condition is a well known problem for the calculation of the optical transition matrix elements @xcite .",
    "each nanocrystal has been placed in a large supercell in order to prevent interactions between the periodic replicas ( about 6  of vacuum separates neighbor nanocrystals ) .",
    "structural , electronic and optical properties , as well as the impurity formation energies , are investigated as a function of the size and for several impurity positions within the si - nc .",
    "starting from the si@xmath4h@xmath5 nanocrystal,@xcite the formation energy of the neutral b or / and p impurities can be defined as the energy needed to insert one b or / and one p atom within the nanocrystal after removing one / two si atoms ( transferred to the chemical reservoir , assumed to be bulk si)@xcite + @xmath6 where e is the total energy of the system , @xmath7 the total energy per atom of bulk si and @xmath8 the total energy per atom of the impurity ( we consider the total energy per atom in the tetragonal b@xmath9 crystal for b , as in ref . and the orthorhombic black phosphorus for p , as in ref . ) .",
    "the integers @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be set to either @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 is the choice when a b impurity is present in the nanocrystal ( @xmath12 otherwise ) and @xmath15 for a p impurity ( @xmath12 otherwise ) . with this prescription , eq.[deltahf ]",
    "can be used for both the single doping and the codoping case .",
    "the calculations of the optical properties have been done both in the ground and in the first excited states , where the excited state corresponds to the electronic configuration in which the highest occupied single - particle state ( homo ) contains a hole , while the lowest unoccupied single - particle state ( lumo ) contains the corresponding electron.@xcite it is worth pointing out that an undoped and relaxed si - nc have t@xmath16 symmetry ; in the presence of doping , this high symmetry is generally lost due to the presence of the impurity atoms . moreover , because of the significant differences in the charge density of the ground and excited states , the actual atomic relaxations in the two cases are different .",
    "the nanocrystal optical response is evaluated for both the ground and the excited state relaxed geometries computing the imaginary part of the dielectric function ( @xmath17 ) through the fermi golden rule .",
    "the emission spectra have been calculated using the excited state atomic positions and the ground state electronic configuration ( more details can be found in section [ lum ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that although @xmath17 should only be used for calculating the nanocrystal absorption coefficient , it can also be used for getting a first approximation to the emission spectra simply because the emission can be viewed as the time reversal of the absorption.@xcite in other words , once the relaxed atomic positions corresponding to to an hole in the homo and an electron in the lumo have been found , these atomic positions are used for the calculation of @xmath17 whose main features are also those of the emission spectra .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the photoluminescence spectra can be derived using the well known van roosbroeck and shockley @xcite relation which , again , involves @xmath17 .",
    "however , such a calculation requires the knowledge of the electron and hole populations , at the working temperature , in the lumo and homo states respectively .",
    "the populations , in turn , depends on the actual dynamics in the excitation and emission processes , including the non radiative electron hole recombinations . in this work",
    "we have not considered any particular dynamics so that our emission spectra contains only the informations related to both the transition energies and the oscillator strengths .    .[tablesi87 ] bond lengths ( in  ) around the impurity sites for the undoped , single doped and codoped si@xmath18h@xmath19 nanocrystal ( diameter 1.50 nm ) .",
    "b and p impurities have been substitutionally located at subsurface positions ( see fig . [ si85bp ] ) .",
    "si@xmath20 and si@xmath21 refer to two surface and two inner si atoms around this site respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the differences between full many - body calculations and single - particle results are of 0.55 ev and 0.41 ev for absorption and emission energy gaps respectively , and of 0.14 ev between the two stokes shifts .",
    "it is interesting to note that the homo - lumo transition in the emission spectrum at 2.20 ev is almost dark while an important excitonic peak is evident at about 2.75 ev ( see fig .",
    "[ si33abs - ems ] ) , again red - shifted with respect to the first absorption peak . as expected , what comes out is the importance of fully taking into account the many - body aspect of the problem in order to overcome the limits of the single - particle approach .",
    "the structural , electronic and optical properties of si nanocrystals codoped with b and p impurities have been studied also going beyond the single - particle approach .",
    "we have considered si - nc of different size and with the impurities located at different distances .",
    "we show that codoping is always energetically favored with respect to simple b- or p - doping and that the two impurities tend to occupy nearest neighbor sites near the surface rather than other positions inside the nanocrystal itself .",
    "our results demonstrate that the codoped nanocrystals present valence and conduction band - edge states which are localized on the two impurities respectively and band - gaps always lower in energy with respect to that of undoped si nanocrystals . besides , the electronic properties show a dependence on both nanocrystal size and impurity - impurity distance .",
    "the impurity located band - edge states originate absorption thresholds in the visible region which are shifted lower in energy with respect to the undoped case .",
    "moreover , the emission spectra show a stokes shift with respect to the absorption which is due to the structural relaxation after the creation of the electron - hole pair .",
    "our results make evident the presence of electronic quasi - direct optical transitions between donor and acceptor states that can help to understand the experimental outcomes and makes it possible to engineer the absorption and emission properties of si nanocrystals .",
