    "quantum hall fluids occur at low temperature in clean two - dimensional electron systems exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite different phases are characterized by the number @xmath0 that tells the ratio of the number of electrons to the number of single - particle states in a highly degenerate landau level ( the number of flux quanta piercing the sample ) . near certain fractional filling factors",
    "@xmath0 , the interactions between electrons induce an energy gap and lead to a ground state with topological order manifest in exotic quasiparticles and non - fermi liquid edge modes.@xcite    straight from the outset , numerical simulations have been an indispensable guide in development of the theory.@xcite while majority of the numerics are exact diagonalization studies only viable with small electron numbers , variational monte carlo@xcite and density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) have also been applied to larger systems .",
    "for example , accurate wave functions incorporating the complex non - perturbative effects of electron interactions have been theoretically devised and later backed up by the high overlap with exact numerical results for small systems . due to such developements , reason behind the energy gap of simplest of the many fractions",
    "is now well understood within the framework of composite - fermion theory that allows for explicit construction of the many - body wave function and calculation of topological quantum numbers.@xcite however , in going beoynd the composite - fermion theory to more complex phases , the monte carlo method is crippled since a trustworthy trial wave function for the phases we would be interested to know more about is not known .",
    "in addition , owing to the strong correlations , the dft is inaccurate at , for example , the paradigm fractional quantum hall state at filling fraction @xmath1 where the vortices supposed to form a bound state with the electrons localize at fixed positions instead.@xcite consequently , the exact diagonalization is frequently the only viable alternative , leaving the large electron numbers beyond the reach of direct calculations , though the density matrix renormalization group method has brought some progress making a bit larger systems computationally feasible.@xcite    during the past 10 years , reduced density matrix functional theory has been revived and applied successfully in the chemical physics community.@xcite the method is known to handle e.g. molecular dissociation limits better than standard dft,@xcite and it has recently been applied to homogeneous electron gas.@xcite in this manuscript , we aim to probe the potential of the one - body reduced density - matrix functional theory ( 1-rdmft ) in a fractional quantum hall system , specifically a parabolically confined quantum dot in the spin - frozen strong magnetic field regime .",
    "in contrast to many molecular and atomic systems where the dominant occupation numbers are typically close to one , this is a highly demanding application for any numerical method as fractional quantum hall states have long - range quantum entanglement with all the occupation numbers small for example near 1/3 in the @xmath1 state .",
    "the performance of various functionals in predicting ground states , energies , and observables attainable by the reduced density matrix is compared for small system to the exact diagonalization and hartree - fock with and without the brillouin - wigner perturbation theory . for larger systems with tens of particles ,",
    "the comparison is done utilizing the accurate laughlin wave function@xcite for filling fraction @xmath1 state and monte carlo methods .",
    "energies are produced quite well in all systems at the strong - correlation regime @xmath2 .",
    "even the bulk densities appear reasonably good and reproduce the predicted edge stripe phase.@xcite however , we are still dealing with an approximate method that has its limitations .",
    "detailed properties of the edge of the electron droplet , such as the edge tunneling exponent,@xcite are not produced correctly by the present functionals .",
    "for this reason , we also perform a small comparison with the heavier two - body reduced density matrix functional theory@xcite ( 2-rdmft ) ( see the closely related work in ref .  ) . including the exact electron interaction by the two - body reduced density - matrix functional appears to facilitate a more accurate description of the edge , however with a computational cost in large systems beyond the reach of present day computers .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the idea of reduced density matrix functional methods . in section  [ model ] , we describe the model system and derive an exact formula for the energy contribution due to one - body operators present in our hamiltonian such that only the interaction energy remains to be solved .",
    "section [ rdmft ] and b present the details of our 1-rdmft and 2-rdmft implementations , respectively .",
    "the 1-rdmft results are divided according to the small or large size of the system into section [ res1 ] and b , followed by the 2-rdmft calculation in section [ res3 ] .",
    "conclusions and future prospects are found in section [ summary ] .",
    "the 1-rdmft is based on the gilbert s theorem , which guarantees that the ground - state expectation value of any observable is a unique functional of the 1-rdm @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite it follows that the ground state energy can be written as @xmath4=\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{2d } } \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r'}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r ' } ) ( t(\\mathbf{r})+u(\\mathbf{r}))\\gamma(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'})+v_{\\rm ee}[\\gamma]\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the standard operators for the kinetic energy and an external potential while the functional for the interaction energy @xmath7 $ ] is unknown .",
    "it is simple to show that this functional yields the exact ground state energy for the exact 1-rdm @xmath8 if @xmath9 is replaced by half the coulomb energy of the exact pair - density @xmath10 the 2-rdmft minimizes the resulting exact functional @xmath11 subject to a subset of complete @xmath12-representability conditions , known as the 2-representability conditions , and other possible constraints due to additional symmetries ( see sec .",
    "[ 2rdm ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the crux of the 1-rdmft is to approximate the pair - density by a functional of the 1-rdm.@xcite the customary way to do the approximation , which we will also employ in this paper , is to replace the pair - density above by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density at @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the natural orbitals ( eigenvectors of @xmath3 ) , and @xmath17 is a function solely of the natural occupation numbers @xmath18 $ ] ( eigenvalues of @xmath3 ) . the functional for the interaction energy in eq .",

    "[ rdmft ] . in analogy with the density functional theory ,",
    "the first term is referred to as the hartree term while the latter is the exchange - correlation term .",
    "however , compared to the dft , 1-rdmft has a couple of advantages .",
    "firstly , the method obtains not only the density but the whole 1-rdm so that the ground - state expectation value of any one - body observable can be readily computed .",
    "thus , for example kinetic and interaction energies can be readily separated and green s functions calculated . secondly , although both methods are in principle exact for an exact functional , due to the variable @xmath3 ( vs. @xmath20 ) , it is easier to develop a good 1-rdm functional than a good density functional .",
    "this is the reason why the dft does not work in the strongly correlated regime where the proper treatment of electronic correlations is important .",
    "however , there are fresh ideas of how to treat strongly correlated electrons with dft",
    "the quantum hall droplet is modeled by the two - dimensional effective - mass hamiltonian @xmath21 +   \\sum_{i < j } \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon r_{ij}}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the number of electrons , @xmath22 is the planar vector potential of the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath23 perpendicular to the sample plane , and the energy scale of the external confinement potential @xmath24 is typically a few mevs .",
    "the material parameters are the effective mass of the electrons @xmath25 and the dielectric constant of the gaas semiconductor medium @xmath26 .",
    "coulomb interactions tend to spontaneously polarize the electron spins in an effect known as quantum hall ferromagnetism .",
    "for this reason , the relatively weak zeeman term has been omitted and the electrons are assumed spin - polarized . from here on , we use oscillator units so that the energies are expressed in units of @xmath27 and lengths in units of @xmath28 where @xmath29 with cyclotron frequency @xmath30 .    for @xmath31 ,",
    "the energy states are written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are given by @xmath35 we take on interest in developing a computational method for the fractional quantum hall states at the strong magnetic field regime , so we may assume that @xmath36 . then @xmath37 is close to unity , such that the term in parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) becomes small and values of quantum number @xmath38 other than 0 become irrelevant to the low energy physics .",
    "this is the landau level projection to the band with @xmath39 .",
    "it should not be difficult to generalize the 1-rdmft method to include spin and several landau levels and study the region @xmath40 as well , however , for simplicity we stick to the spin - polarized lowest landau level @xmath41 in this study .",
    "note that in our two dimensional model , @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ wff ] ) is the one and only angular momentum quantum number .",
    "we can write the contribution to the total energy due to terms other than the coulomb interaction for a system of @xmath12 electrons in the lowest landau level @xmath39 in terms of the total angular momentum ( quantum number ) @xmath43 exactly as @xmath44=n+\\left(1-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_c}{2}\\right)m\\ .\\ ] ]    as the total angular momentum operator @xmath45 commutes with the total coulomb interaction energy operator @xmath9 , to solve the landau level projected spectrum , the remaining task is to find the common eigenstates of the landau level projected @xmath9 and @xmath45 .    for @xmath12 and @xmath43 small enough ,",
    "these are solved exactly with the configuration interaction method ( exact diagonalization ) since the number of possible single - particle states is finite .",
    "we may go to a bit larger @xmath12 and @xmath43 by taking interest in only the ground state and finding it by the lanczos algorithm ( cf . refs . )",
    ". however , the exponential growth of the many - body basis limits the particle number to around 10 depending on @xmath43 , and some kind of an approximate calculation method becomes necessary .",
    "the kohn - sham dft is still a good method for the weakly correlated regime@xcite but for larger @xmath43 the natural occupations tend far from 1 and the dft no longer gives us good results .",
    "absence of a reliable trial wave function for generic @xmath43 makes the implementation of variational monte carlo rather uncertain.@xcite in this paper we are going to see , if the reduced density matrix functional theory can make itself useful .",
    "the expectation is that it will work better than dft at least when the eigenvalues of the density matrix are small meaning @xmath2 .",
    "with several landau levels , this would correspond to the situation where the highest occupied landau level has low filling fraction .",
    "due to the exact formula for the one - body operators energy contribution ( eq .",
    "( [ tu ] ) ) , the energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ frho ] ) simplifies to @xmath46=n+\\left(1-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_c}{2}\\right)m+v_{\\rm ee}[\\gamma]\\ , \\ ] ] with the constraints that the particle number and the total angular momentum are @xmath12 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the natural orbitals for energy state @xmath47 in the lowest landau level are directly the single - particle energy states since the angular momentum conservation yields a diagonal density matrix in this basis @xmath48 where @xmath49 and its adjoint annihilate and create a particle with quantum numbers @xmath39 and @xmath42 ( see eq .",
    "( [ wff ] ) ) . as @xmath50 particles",
    "have at least a total angular momentum @xmath51 , the maximum single - particle angular momentum becomes @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the minimization of the interaction energy reduces to the constrained minimization of a function whose variables are @xmath53 occupation numbers @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the interaction matrix elements of the lowest landau level orbitals computed in ref . , and the constraints are explicitly written as @xmath56 to optimize the occupation numbers , we first express them in terms of variables @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "the minimization of @xmath9 with the above two remaining constraints is then performed with the interior point or nelder - mead algorithm of mathematica.@xcite    a vast number of functions @xmath59 have been proposed in the literature in treatment of simple atoms and molecules , and it is not immediately clear , which of them would work well in the current system .",
    "table  [ functions ] summarizes those used in this work for small systems to find out the optimal ones . for large systems",
    ", we only use the density - matrix power functional @xmath60 ( p-@xmath61).@xcite each form of the off - diagonal @xmath62 corresponds to two different functions , first of which has diagonal @xmath63 while the second has @xmath64",
    ". since the natural orbitals are orthonormal , integration of the approximate pair - density in eq .",
    "( [ apd ] ) over the coordinates yields the proper normalization @xmath65 for @xmath63 . the form @xmath66 , on the other hand , is justified as it cancels the self - interaction terms @xmath67 arising from the hartree term .",
    "a few words about different forms of the off - diagonal terms are in order ( see last column in table  [ functions ] ) .",
    "the form @xmath68 for @xmath17 was first introduced by mller , who found @xmath69 ( mu ) to be the optimal value.@xcite goedecker and umrigar ( gu ) used the modification to the diagonal that removes the self - interaction terms.@xcite much similar to the density - matrix power functional , we generalize these to mu-@xmath61 and gu-@xmath61 where the square root is replaced by an arbitrary power , presumably lying between half and one .",
    "alternatively , it is often physically motivated to reduce the overcorrelation of mu by switching the sign of the off - diagonal terms between weakly occupied natural orbitals @xmath70 ( bbc1 ) or additionally banishing the square root for pairs of strongly occupied orbitals @xmath71 ( bbc2 ) .",
    "@xcite for simplicity , we define the strongly and weakly occupied orbitals directly from the hartree - fock solution where the occupations are 0 or 1 .",
    "@xmath72    finally , we would like to point out an issue with the physicality of the obtained solution , which is generally more of a problem in the higher order rdm methods .",
    "specifically , coleman has shown that necessary and sufficient condition for the 1-rdm to be @xmath12-representable , meaning that there exists @xmath47 in the hilbert space of the system such that @xmath73 , is that its eigenvalues are between 0 and 1 and their sum is @xmath12.@xcite however , if we additionally demand a symmetry , it may be that the obtained solution is not representable in the symmetry restricted part of the hilbert space . to be explicit ,",
    "if in our model we demand total angular momentum of a two electron system to be 2 , the symmetry restricted hilbert space of states with @xmath74 , and 2 consists only of one state with occupations @xmath75 while 1-rdm method could give us unphysical occupations @xmath76 both having the same particle number and angular momentum ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "while this could be avoided by imposing additional constraints , we refrain from doing it as that would be exponentially unfeasible for larger systems . additionally , it is plausible that the unphysical solutions have less weight when the size of the physical hilbert space increases .      in analogy with the 1-rdmft ,",
    "we now minimize a functional of the 2-rdm @xmath78 the marked difference is that we now have an exact functional for the interaction energy @xmath79 however , with the cost of large number of additional parameters to optimize with similarly large number of additional constraints .",
    "furthermore , the set of constraints to be listed below form a relatively stringent set of necessary conditions that only in special cases is sufficient for the obtained solution to be exactly @xmath12-representable , meaning a physical @xmath47 to exist such that eq .",
    "( [ gijkl ] ) holds .",
    "the minimization of the functional ( [ 2fun ] ) is performed by forming an augmented lagrangian function and minimizing it following the algorithm in ref .  .",

    "we first introduce the subset of applied @xmath12-representability conditions , and after that , impose the further constraints due to the fixed total angular momentum , @xmath43-representability .",

    "since @xmath86 , it follows that @xmath87 for @xmath88 we obtain the 2-positivity condition for the 2-rdm @xmath89 by a different choice of @xmath90 , positivity conditions of the exact same form can be derived for the two other representations of the 2-rdm @xmath91 while the representations @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are all equivalent as they are related by the fermionic anticommutation rules , the positivity conditions are inequivalent and must be taken into account simultaneously .",
    "we use the antisymmetric basis @xmath95 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 matrices since @xmath96 and @xmath97 . furthermore following ref .  ,",
    "since all the three matrices are real and symmetric under @xmath98 , the positive - definite condition can be accounted for simply by writing the matrices as square of symmetric matrices @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( meaning @xmath102 etc . ) and optimizing the upper diagonal of matrices @xmath103 , @xmath71 , and @xmath5 . the linear relations linking @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath92 and @xmath94 become the relevant constraint equations @xmath104 + where the 1-rdm @xmath105 may be obtained through @xmath106      since @xmath107 , we can form one independent nontrivial equation involving 2-rdm ( equivalent to the contracted schrdinger equation in ref . )",
    "@xmath108    the trace of this is already fixed by eqs .",
    "( [ ntr ] ) and ( [ rdmrel ] ) @xmath109 since in our system the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath110 are always non - negative , the maximum angular momentum for a pair of electrons to have is @xmath111 where the subtracted term is the minimum angular momentum of @xmath112 electrons . additionally , some of the matrix elements of the 2-rdm are zero because states with different total angular momentum are orthogonal .",
    "the independent constraints due to these considerations read @xmath113 while eq .",
    "( [ qg ] ) communicates them to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "though we can just drop the corresponding terms from our equations , we still need to take into account the ensuing constraints on the actual variables @xmath103,@xmath71 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the calculation of the natural orbital occupations is relatively simple using the monte carlo technique . unlike in the previous monte carlo study in ref . , we know from the start the natural orbitals that diagonalize the density matrix , and thus we only need to calculate the occupations .",
    "starting from the definition ( [ exact1rdm ] ) , the orthogonality of the natural orbitals , and the expansion of 1-rdm using the natural orbitals @xmath114 the occupations are integrated as @xmath115 this is further reformulated as @xmath116 which can be symmetrized and rewritten in monte carlo expectation value as @xmath117 where the summation is over the coordinates @xmath118 . the first strategy for monte carlo evaluation of",
    "the occupation is to sample these coordinates from @xmath119 and to integrate over @xmath120 on a grid.@xcite    for a better option in our case , we first rewrite @xmath121 and then do a monte carlo integration also over @xmath120 as @xmath122 where @xmath118 is again sampled from @xmath119 and @xmath120 from @xmath123 .",
    "this option can be made more stable by noting that the natural orbitals have rotation symmetry and @xmath124 depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath125 and not on the angle @xmath126 .",
    "now , the radial integral over @xmath125 can be done using monte carlo integration and the angular integral by averaging over a uniform grid @xmath127 as @xmath128 notice that @xmath125 is generated separately for each @xmath129 .",
    "in the following , we will first compare the performance of various 1-rdm functionals in calculating the interaction energies in different @xmath130 sectors in exactly solvable small quantum hall droplets .",
    "this analysis is deepened by analyzing the occupation numbers obtained for the ground states .",
    "once we have established that we have a decent functional , we proceed to test its performance in larger systems .",
    "since no exact results are available for larger systems at the strongly correlated regime @xmath2 , we employ the next best gripping handle , which is the laughlin s variational wave function for filling fraction @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we compare the energies and occupations obtained with density - matrix power functionals ( p-@xmath61 ) to the results extracted from the laughlin s wave function with monte carlo techniques . from the occupation numbers we calculate the edge green s function @xmath131 , which gives information about the topological order of different quantum hall phases .",
    "it is interesting to see if the newly applied methods ( 1-rdmft and 2-rdmft ) reproduce the correct decay properties of @xmath131 .",
    "the energy states of the quantum dot may be written as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the @xmath38th eigenvalue of the total interaction energy in sector @xmath134 , whose dependence on the physical parameters is scaling by a factor @xmath135 .",
    "because of the second term , it follows that all possible ground states for @xmath12 particles are found at the intersections of the @xmath43-@xmath9-curve and its convex lower envelope .",

    "the exact diagonalization ( ci ) ground states , detected by the convex envelope , are marked by circles .",
    "while both hf and bw predict the correct ground states , the perturbation theory leads to a significant improvement to the hf energy .",
    "the 2nd order perturbation theory is very accurate and close to the ci result for @xmath136 , and it is roughly half - way between hf and ci energy for @xmath137 .",
    "physically the cusp structure seen in the results follows from the energetic advantage of a configuration , in which the 4 electrons are located at vertices of a square .",

    "the difference between subsequent magic angular momentum states is the number of vortices found at the center of the system . as magnetic field",
    "is increased , vortices that carry quantized angular momentum , and in a sense quantized magnetic flux , emerge at the center . as the particle number is taken very large , the number of cusps increases while all cusps no longer correspond to a ground - state at certain system parameters . instead , a few of them are more special than others forming the incompressible vacuum state of certain fractional quantum hall phase as the remaining cusps are related to the quasiparticle / vortex excitations that are eventually responsible for the finite extension of the quantum hall plateaus .",

    "the choice of parameters @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 for mu-@xmath61 , p-@xmath61 , and gu-@xmath61 is an educated guess , whereas the effect of the parameter @xmath61 becomes apparent in the next section ( basically , it tunes the strength of electron correlations ) .",
    "typical to 1-rdmft calculations in general , the energies are below the ci result .",
    "the dashed lines systematically lie below the solid lines of the same tone , due to the self - energy cancellation present in the latter .",
    "basic mu and gu functionals clearly overestimate the correlation energy and behave even qualitatively wrong as they fall too fast with increasing @xmath43 . for the rest of the functionals , @xmath9 seems to decline at about the correct rate as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "however , a nice cusp structure is only seen with the bbc1s and bbc2s functionals , which inherit the cusps from the hf state used in the selection of the strongly and weakly occupied orbitals .",
    "overall the energetically best of these 1-rdm functionals ( p-0.7 , gu-0.65 , bbc1s , and bbc2s ) perform better than the 2nd order perturbation theory when @xmath137 , although only bbc2s produces the correct ground state structure .",

    ", the performance of different functionals seems to be rather insensitive to the particle number . for six electrons ,",
    "the cusps should occur at @xmath138 or @xmath142 corresponding to a hexagonal configuration or a pentagonal configuration with one electron at the center .",
    "all the cusps are not correctly reproduced with any 1-rdm functional , though bbc2s result follows the cusp structure quite well at @xmath143 .",
    "the quantum hall droplet model has the property that an increase in @xmath43 increases the area of the droplet and also the electronic correlations quantified in reduction of the occupation numbers of the natural landau level orbitals .",
    "the average occupation number of the relevant orbitals is close to the corresponding macroscopic quantum hall filling fraction @xmath0 and becomes exact as @xmath12 is taken to infinity .",
    "for example , the @xmath144 state occurs at the minimum angular momentum @xmath145 where the first @xmath12 orbitals have occupation 1 .",
    "second example is the laughlin s wave function@xcite for filling fraction @xmath1 @xmath146 it has angular momentum @xmath147 and @xmath148 nonempty orbitals such that on average the fraction @xmath149 is filled .",
    "the laughlin state has about 0.98 overlap with the exact ground state for 4 and 6 electrons , and it is the lowest angular momentum zero - energy state of the short - range model interaction@xcite @xmath150 note , however that while for four electrons the highly correlated laughlin state occurs at @xmath151 near the center of the @xmath43-window in the @xmath43-@xmath9-curves , the corresponding angular momentum for six electrons is @xmath152 , and it is the highest @xmath43 included in the corresponding figures .",

    "the inclination towards pinning is due to the self - energy cancellation , since without the cancellation non - pinned occupations lead to negative self - energy contribution lowering the total energy ( @xmath154 for @xmath155 ) .",

    "gu-@xmath61 with @xmath159 and mu-@xmath61 with @xmath160 could also work well , however , since the diagonal part of the p-@xmath61 functional is somewhat a compromise between these two , we employ the p-@xmath61 functional in the remainder of the manuscript .",
    "the results of the previous section suggest that the density matrix power functional ( p-@xmath61 ) could be a good functional in quantum hall systems , and thus we apply it to large systems for a few parameters @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , we concentrate on the @xmath1 state , whereby close to exact nonperturbative results can be computed with the laughlin s variational wave function ( eq .  ( [ lawf ] ) ) using monte carlo .",
    "it is natural to limit the number of natural orbitals to that of the laughlin wave function @xmath148 although the realistic coulomb ground state would actually extend , weakly though , to a few more orbitals .",

    "[ moc ] . as seen in the exact result ( first row in fig .

    "the latter has slightly longer oscillation wavelength compared to the p-@xmath61 results while the amplitude of oscillations suggests that the optimal value of @xmath61 is somewhere between 0.675 and 0.7 .",

    "except for the curve corresponding to p-0.75 , which oscillates heavily , the p-@xmath61 curves follow closely the theoretical dashed black line until @xmath180 , after which they sheer off the course to yield an exponent 1 .",
    "this is due to the incorrect weights of the occupation numbers near the edge of the system and investigated further in the next subsection where we apply 2-rdmft to a smaller system .",
    "the interaction energies are shown in table [ tabe ] .",
    "the exactness of the laughlin trial wave function s energy ( mc ) up to 0.1% for @xmath161 is expected to carry on to the larger electron numbers .",

    "while knowledge of the ground state energy may be useful when comparing different methods , only energy differences are physically meaningful . in the rdm methods",
    ", we can calculate the energy differences between lowest energy states of different @xmath134 sectors such as addition energy ( change in @xmath12 ) as well as quasiparticle and some edge excitations ( @xmath43 changes ) .",
    "if the excited state becomes the ground state for some parameters , the gilbert s theorem guarantees the existence of a 1-rdm functional minimized by the exact 1-rdm but even if this is not the case , a good functional might still exist .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "some of the cusps in @xmath43-@xmath9-curves correspond to the quasiparticle excitations of stable quantum hall phases .",
    "next , we consider such a quasihole excitation above the @xmath1 state .",
    "the quasihole is a charged vortex carrying fractional charge @xmath182 and obeying anyonic statistics.@xcite to obtain interaction part of the quasihole excitation energy at @xmath1 , we need to calculate the difference @xmath183 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath184 follows from the laughlin s quasihole wave function , which is also used to compute an estimate for @xmath185 with monte carlo .",
    "due to the fact that laughlin s wave function is more accurate than the quasihole wave function , variational principle implies that the monte carlo estimate to the ( negative ) contribution to the excitation energy is likely an upper bound to the exact result .",
    "nevertheless , for 8 particles the difference to exact ci result is less than 0.2% so we expect the estimates to be quite accurate .",
    "the quasihole wave function reads @xmath186 where @xmath187 .",
    "the interaction contribution to the excitation energy is shown in table [ tabe3 ] .",
    "the power functionals appear to overestimate the energy gap by 10 to 20 percent compared to the trial wave function though the results seem to get more accurate with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "this preliminary result indicates that the method could prove useful in assessing the stability of different models for quantum hall phases characterized by certain angular momentum and spin .",
    "additionally , 1-rdm method offers a simple framework to include the higher landau levels , however , instead of the bare eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , one must then optimize the eigenvectors also .",
    "in this final part , we apply the exact 2-rdm functional ( eq .  ( [ exa ] ) ) to a three electron droplet in the 1/3 state again with the maximum single - particle angular momentum set to @xmath188 .",
    "we will see that the resulting 2-rdm , though not strictly physical , is close to the exact solution and yields better results than our 1-rdm functionals .",
    "compared to the 1-rdm calculations seen above , the computational cost of the problem in the 2-rdm optimization is considerably larger and scales at higher order @xmath189 ( versus @xmath190 ) with the number of single - particle orbitals @xmath191 .",
    "the 1/3 laughlin state for 3 electrons has angular momentum @xmath192 and requires only 7 single - particle states .",
    "however , the number of optimization variables in @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are 276 , 378 , and 1225 , respectively , and the constraint equations ( [ ntr],[qg],[mc1],[mc2 ] ) together lead to 2798 constraints each facilitated by a lagrange multiplier . in practice , this means that this method takes more time than exact diagonalization in any system that could be solved in a reasonable time .",
    "however , owing to the exponential scaling of the exact diagonalization problem , the situation could change in future with development of faster computers and more efficient semi - definite programming and optimization algorithms .     with the first coordinate placed at the density maximum of the negative y - axis @xmath193 for ( a ) exact diagonalization , ( b ) 2-rdmft , and ( c ) 1-rdmft with p-0.675 .",

    "the 2-rdmft result has a similar cusp while the p-0.675 result , which turns smoothly to a lower slope decay , does not have one .",
    "we verified that this is due to the difference in the weights of the last three occupation numbers corresponding to the edge of the system .",
    "since the hf solution would have exponent @xmath179 , the correct decay property of the green s function follows from the off - diagonal terms of the interaction operator .",
    "the 1-rdmft that only uses the diagonal @xmath197 and @xmath198 terms of the interaction matrix can not yield the correct behavior unless we have a very good density matrix functional .",
    "recall that the backbone of the 1-rdmft was the approximation of the pair - density .",
    "figure [ pdds ] shows the pair - correlation functions corresponding again to exact diagonalization , 2-rdmft , and p-0.675 , where the latter is reconstructed from the 1-rdm using eq .",
    "( [ apd ] ) .",
    "although the 1-rdm reconstructed pair - correlation function is reasonable vanishing at the position of the fixed electron , only the 2-rdmft is able to produce the two - peak structure of the exact result with reduced density along the @xmath199-axis .",
    "granted that the interaction energy functional in the 2-rdmft is exact , the results still do not coincide with the exact diagonalization results because the 3-representability conditions that ensure the physicality in this 3-electron system can not be taken into account without invoking the generalization of 2-rdmft to include higher order rdms .",
    "figure  [ gammaob](a ) shows the exact non - zero matrix elements of the 2-rdm @xmath200 in the antisymmetric basis @xmath95 and ( b ) calculated with the 2-rdmft .",
    "the largest discrepancy between the results is the vanishing of the matrix elements involving states @xmath201 or @xmath202 for the exact result , while for example @xmath203 in the 2-rdmft result . the matrix elements should vanish , as they are related to the fictitious many - body basis states that have double occupancy of orbital 4 or 2 ( @xmath204 , the total angular momentum ) . consequently , the absolute values of the matrix elements also differ",
    ". however , the computed pair - correlation function and edge green s function suggest that many of the physical quantities are not significantly affected by the absence of exact @xmath12-representability , and that the lack of computer power might be the only real stumbling stone in the way of the 2-rdmft .",
    "in summary , we have applied the one - body reduced density - matrix functional theory to small and large quantum hall droplets at the spin - polarized strong magnetic field regime . the density - matrix power functional seems to work reasonably well at the strongly correlated @xmath2 regime where the occupation numbers of the natural orbitals are small .",
    "the newly applied method yields previously inaccessible valuable information with large particle numbers about the energetics and quantities that derive from the one - body reduced density matrix .",
    "the density - matrix power functional yields reasonable bulk densities with the power parameter in the range 0.65 - 0.7 .",
    "however , the detailed properties of the edge are not produced accurately with this functional .",
    "moreover , it is not known if a good functional for a specific quantum hall state would work universally at different filling fractions .",
    "nevertheless , the computationally expensive 2-body reduced density matrix method seems to facilitate the properties of the edge , though this should be verified with a larger electron number in future .",
    "prospects of the 1-rdmft in quantum hall systems include generalizations to spin and multiple landau levels .",
    "studies with systems without edge ( sphere ) and non - trivial topology ( torus ) are also encouraged while new state of the art energy functionals are of course very welcome .",
