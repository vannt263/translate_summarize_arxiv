    "superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) are the most employed superconductive electronic circuits in practical applications.@xcite with the discovery of high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) also high - temperature squids have been developed.@xcite this class of devices , although less sensitive than the most competitive low - temperature squids , have been used in several applications , where portability and/or positioning as much as high working temperatures are needed",
    ". moreover , the demonstration of an unconventional symmetry of the order parameter in _ ybacuo _ ( ybco),@xcite opened new horizons for using the so - called pi - squids in superconductive electronics .",
    "indeed , @xmath3-squids@xcite can be used to self - frustrate quantum bit circuits or to feed rsfq ( rapid single flux quantum ) devices.@xcite    as a consequence , a full knowledge of properties of hts squids is at great importance . in particular",
    ", the aspects limiting their utilization in applications have to be explored .",
    "we can consider two effects limiting performance of hts zero - or @xmath3-squids ( zero indicates the conventional squid where no phase shift has been established along the superconducting loop ) : asymmetries in the junction properties and anomalous electrical behavior induced by an arbitrary phase shift in one of the two junctions forming the interferometer .",
    "asymmetries in conventional low - temperature devices have been first examined by tesche and clarke.@xcite in their paper a complete study of the performance in terms of noise characteristics has been carried out .",
    "the interest on asymmetric squids grew up again after the discovery of hts .",
    "indeed , the parameter spread in hts squids is often so large that significant asymmetries arise .",
    "hence , it is particularly hard to fabricate two identical hts josephson junctions , even though they are very close to each other on the chip .",
    "performance of asymmetric squids have been analyzed by testa and co - workers.@xcite from their papers it is evident that higher magnetic sensitivities are achieved when asymmetric squids are used .",
    "the asymmetry combined with a damping resistance leads to a flux to voltage transfer coefficient several times larger than the one typical for symmetric devices , together with a lower magnetic flux noise .",
    "the large ratio of the flux to voltage transfer coefficient allows a direct coupling to an external preamplifier without the need of an impedance matching flux transformer or additional positive feedback circuitry .",
    "this simplifies the read - out electronics , as required in multi - channel systems for low - noise measurements .",
    "however , the final performance of a dc - squid is influenced by the presence of undesired anomalies occurring on the current - voltage ( iv ) characteristics , namely fiske or resonant steps.@xcite such structures originate for the non - linear interaction between the resonant cavity , represented by the superconducting loop , and an rf current component - the ac josephson current in the junctions .",
    "this system may be treated with the equivalent electrical resonant circuit , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "a deep investigation of the properties of resonances in asymmetric squids , also including different phase shift in the squid loop , is mandatory and can be very useful for people involved in squid design .",
    "self - resonances occurring in superconducting interferometers are considered to be phenomena reducing performance of high - sensitive squids . indeed , zappe and landman@xcite first investigated experimentally resonances in low - q josephson interferometers .",
    "the analysis was taken again by tuckerman and magerlein,@xcite who presented a theoretical and experimental investigation of resonances in symmetric devices . successively , faris and walsamakis@xcite showed characteristic of resonances in asymmetric two - junction interferometers , introducing an important distinction between current- and voltage - controlled cases . based on their analysis , camerlingo",
    "et al.@xcite reported an experimental work showing the effect of the loop capacitance on resonant voltages in asymmetric interferometers .",
    "recently , the nature of resonances in squids in which a significant flux is coupled to the josephson junctions , called spatially distributed junctions ( sdj ) dc - squid , has been analyzed by chesca.@xcite he showed that useful information about the order parameter symmetry can be provided by studying directly the magnetic field dependences of both the dc josephson critical current and self - induced resonant modes of dc - squids made of non - conventional superconductors .",
    "the further analysis of voltage states in current - voltage characteristics of symmetric dc @xmath3-squids , in which the junctions are equal and not - distributed circuital elements , has been done by chesca and co - workers.@xcite moreover , d - wave induced zero - field resonances in dc @xmath3-squids have also been observed.@xcite    in our work we present a full investigation of resonances in asymmetric squids , also in the presence of asymmetries in the junction phases .",

    "ii we outline the model hamiltonian , and we derive equations for asymmetric dc - squids . in sec iii",
    "we present the method and assumptions which have been made . sec .",
    "iv we present our results considering special cases and their relevance to the other theoretical works . finally in sec .",
    "v we discuss the relevance obtained results to the experimental situations .",
    "we start with defining an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device ( asquid ) which consists of two josephson junctions ( see fig . [ theoretical - model ] ) .",
    "each of them has a critical current @xmath4 and a parallel capacitance @xmath5 .",
    "we assume also that single junction contains a parallel linear resistance @xmath6 and interferometer is fed by an external source @xmath7 , but the details of the equivalent circuit will be specified later .",
    "the self - inductances of the junctions in asquid are equal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we do not consider mutual inductances between the junctions .",
    "hamiltonian of the asquid contains three parts@xcite:@xmath10 first term on the right side of eq .",

    "the last equation can be transformed to the phase representation using the josephson relation @xmath14:@xmath15 where @xmath16 is a phase difference across the @xmath13th junction .",
    "the second term is the josephson energy : @xmath17 where @xmath18 . to complete the set of equations for",
    "the interferometer one should take into account that loop current @xmath19 can contribute to the flux .",

    "introduce the following parameters @xmath28 where dimensionless anisotropy quantities @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath29 describe the relative deviations of the model parameters from the corresponding average values @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can vary the values of the anisotropy parameters within the range @xmath33 , where zero leads to the isotropic model and value one completely rules out presence of one junction from the interferometer . since @xmath34",
    "we conclude that a difference between inductances does not influence the dynamics of the model .",
    "after renormalization to dimensionless quantities @xmath35 we finally obtain two coupled non - linear second - order differential equations describing an asquid :    @xmath36    until now we have not considered dissipation effects and specific geometry of the circuit .",
    "first , we have to decide , what modes of operation we think about : current controlled ( cc ) or voltage controlled ( vc ) ?",
    "this is a crucial point simply because a choice we make is going to affect our system . for the vc case where squid is excited by a voltage source @xmath37",
    "we have to add terms proportional to @xmath38 to the equations .",
    "the difference caused by various excitation sources affects frequencies of the oscillating modes of the system . in this paper",
    "we assume that squid is current excited by a constant current source ( see fig .",
    "[ theoretical - model ] ) .",
    "this foundation leads to an additional term @xmath39 in both equations .",
    "origin of the last parameter is clear when we consider the equivalent loop of a real interferometer@xcite where the center of the inductance is fed by a gate current source @xmath40 . using notation from tuckerman s paper and the above information we can derive exact form of @xmath39:@xmath41 where @xmath7 is a circulating current .",
    "considering dissipation due to a quasi - particle current we add parallel resistances @xmath6 .",

    "( [ second symmetry ] ) .",
    "we see that values @xmath44 and @xmath45 lead to the opposite sign of the current which means its opposite direction .",

    "the resonances in squids are investigated theoretically with several asymmetries : josephson current @xmath0 , dissipation @xmath2 and capacitance @xmath1 . in real devices",
    "it is impossible to have an ideal interferometer free of imperfections . in practice various deviations of the interferometer parameters from average values",
    "can occur together and mutually conceal each other . at this stage",
    "we have to separate discussion related to low- and high-@xmath134 squids . in the former case , experimentally , we are able to control asymmetry of dissipative parameter @xmath2 adding a parallel resistor to the junction but it is difficult to change the josephson current independently from the capacitance . to produce the asymmetry of the josephson current in the interferometer we can change the area of the junction @xmath135 or thickness of the barrier @xmath136 . parallel - plate capacitor with area @xmath135 of the plates and space @xmath136 between them has the capacitance equal @xmath137 for @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the relative dielectric constant of the interlayer dielectric and @xmath140 is the vacuum electric constant . on the other hand the critical current can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the critical current density .",
    "these two simple relations imply that varying area @xmath143 of the junction in the interferometer we change both capacitance and critical current proportionally @xmath144 at the same time . when no further resistor is added to the junctions",
    "not only capacitance and josephson current are related . from ambegeokar - baratoff@xcite formula",
    "we know that the product @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the resistance in normal state , has an invariant value which depends only on the material in fixed temperature .",
    "thus changing the value of the josephson current we alter the resistance of the junction . recapitulating these rather simple considerations",
    "we can introduce asymmetry in the josephson current changing the area of the junction ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "setting parallel resistor we can control value of the resistance and vary dissipative parameter independently from the current asymmetry .",
    "we can also imagine junctions with different thicknesses of the barrier but technologically this case is difficult to achieve thus we do not consider it . in experiments with asquid",
    "both technically reached asymmetric cases do not differ very much because of the capacitance anisotropy . as we see from fig .",
    "[ aniverochiall ] the biggest impact on the maximum value of the resonant current has the anisotropy of the capacitance .",
    "even small changes of @xmath1 can decrease excess current almost to zero .",
    "the situation changes completely when high-@xmath134 squids are considered .",
    "on one hand , the probability to find junction parameter asymmetries is particularly high , because high-@xmath134 junctions are intrinsically affected by defects , as for instance faceting and/or oxygen vacancies inside the barrier .",
    "moreover , up to now , the charge transport process is not completely understood , although various hypothesis have been proposed,@xcite and other recent experiments are still in progress.@xcite in particular , the simple rule @xmath148 valid for low-@xmath134 squids does not apply in the case of high-@xmath134 interferometers typically used in applications , based on the symmetric bicrystal c - axis @xmath149 $ ] devices , and changing one single parameter is now possible . in such interferometers , @xmath145 is proportional to the critical current density @xmath150 at low values and stays roughly constant at high-@xmath150 values.@xcite moreover , hts junctions are intrinsically shunted and squids are fabricated with no additional shunt resistor . as a consequence , the way to fabricate hts squids with symmetric junctions is probably to reduce junctions widths , limiting the effect of the interface defects . in all other cases",
    ", asymmetries will be very probable and our analysis could be relevant to understand the presence of resonance steps .",
    "different approach is necessary in the case of asymmetric @xmath149 $ ] or @xmath151 $ ] hts bicrystal junctions , where the relation @xmath145 seems to be similar to the one of low-@xmath134 systems@xcite and the necessity to account for effects of a non - conventional symmetry of the order parameter forces to include also the phase asymmetries in studying dynamical states in hts interferometers . finally ,",
    "also the inclusion of the second harmonic term in the josephson current in order to account for experimental results@xcite is mandatory .",
    "this will be the argument of a separate paper , and the possibility to deal with one single asymmetric parameter is now eventual .",
    "moreover , a non conventional symmetry of the order parameter forces to include also phase asymmetries in studying dynamic states in high-@xmath134 interferometers . in this frame",
    "the calculations derived in the present paper allow to investigate squid dynamics in both low- and high-@xmath134 asymmetric devices .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed theoretical study of the resonances in the asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device .",
    "analytical approach revealed the nature of the resonances in the presence of several asymmetries : josephson current @xmath0 , capacitances @xmath1 and dissipation @xmath2 .",
    "also we were able to derive magnetic field dependence of the excess current in presence of the magnetic field and phase shift .",
    "our calculations imply that deviations of the capacitances from the average value in squid have profound impact on physics of the system .",

    "<S> theory of self induced resonances in asymmetric two - junction interferometer device is presented . in real devices it is impossible to have an ideal interferometer free of imperfections . thus , we extended previous theoretical approaches introducing a model which contains several asymmetries : josephson current @xmath0 , capacitances @xmath1 and dissipation @xmath2 presented in an equivalent circuit </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , non conventional symmetry of the order parameter in high temperature superconducting quantum interference devices forced us to include phase asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the model has been extended to the case of @xmath3-shift interferometers , where a phase shift is present in one of the junctions . </S>"
