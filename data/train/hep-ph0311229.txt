    "the belle collaboration has recently announced@xcite the discovery of a resonance , @xmath0 , in the @xmath9 subsystem of the process    @xmath10    at a mass of @xmath11 mev and with a width    @xmath12    this state , which has been confirmed by the cdf collaboration@xcite , has attracted some attention because of its unusual properties .",
    "specifically , the state appears to be too heavy to be a 1d charmonium state and too light to be 2p charmonium or a @xmath13 hybrid .",
    "@xcite for a detailed assessment of possible charmonium assignments and decay modes .",
    "alternatively , the proximity of the state to @xmath14 threshold strongly suggests that the @xmath15 may be a weakly bound @xmath16 resonance@xcite , sometimes called a mesonic ` molecule ' or a ` deuson'@xcite .",
    "this is an old idea which has been applied to a variety of mesons with unusual characteristics such as the @xmath17@xcite , @xmath18@xcite , @xmath19@xcite , @xmath20@xcite , @xmath21 , and @xmath22@xcite .    in this note",
    "i assume that the @xmath0 is indeed a @xmath16 resonance and present a detailed analysis of its expected properties based on a simple model of quark interactions .",
    "this model incorporates the nonrelativistic quark model with additional dynamics due to pion exchange .",
    "the idea is to capture the predictive power of a microscopic formalism of short range quark dynamics along with the important long range dynamics mediated by pion exchange processes .",
    "versions of this idea have been applied to baryon - baryon interactions since the 1980s@xcite , where , of course , pion exchange is of fundamental importance ; another variant has recently enjoyed some vogue in baryon physics@xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that the putative @xmath16 bound state is in a relative s - wave since this is typically where inter - hadron forces are strongest . in this case",
    "pion - mediated interactions ( see below ) favour the isoscalar channel , which in turn implies a @xmath23 state .",
    "i will therefore henceforth refer to the bound state interpretation of the @xmath0 as the @xmath24 .",
    "the remainder of this paper focusses on the properties of this state .",
    "although pion exchange forces dominate the structure of the @xmath25 ( in analogy to the deuteron ) , short range quark dynamics are present and assist in binding the @xmath26 via mixing to hidden charm vector-@xmath27 states",
    ". indeed , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are very nearly degenerate with @xmath16 and one must expect some admixture of these states  an effect which will be strongly enhanced by the near - zero energy denominator .",
    "such mixing is also important in driving possible decay modes of the @xmath25 and is therefore central to determining its properties .",
    "finally , the binding energy of the @xmath25 is comparable to mass differences in the available charge channels and one can expect strong isospin violating effects in this resonance .",
    "this heretofore unexplored dynamics is thoroughly examined in the following .",
    "detailed predictions of binding energies and branching fractions are presented along with possible experimental tests of @xmath25 structure .",
    "long range pion exchange effects are expected to dominate the physics of a weakly bound state such as the @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed above , short range quark interactions can give rise to important mixing effects .",
    "we therefore consider a model which appends pion exchange dynamics to the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "the model is used to extract effective interactions for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath29 scattering .",
    "these interactions are then employed in a nonrelativistic coupled channel schrdinger equation to extract bound state properties ( one expects the nonrelativistic formalism to be accurate for weakly bound states of relatively massive components as is the case with the @xmath25 ) .",
    "the quark model employed here assumes nonrelativistic quark dynamics mediated by an instantaneous confining interaction and a short range spin - dependent interaction motivated by one gluon exchange .",
    "the colour structure is taken to be the quadratic form of perturbation theory .",
    "this is an important assumption for multiquark dynamics which has received support from recent lattice computations for both confinement@xcite and multiquark interactions@xcite .",
    "the final form of the interaction is thus taken to be    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a colour gell - mann matrix , @xmath32 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath33 is the string tension , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the interacting quark or antiquark masses , and @xmath36 is a range parameter in a regulated spin - spin hyperfine interaction .",
    "the parameters used were @xmath37 , @xmath38 gev@xmath39 , @xmath40 gev , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 gev for up , strange , and charm quark masses respectively .",
    "relevant meson masses obtained from this model are @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 gev , and @xmath47 gev , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "meson - meson interactions are obtained by computing the born order scattering amplitude for a given process@xcite . because of the colour factors in eq .",
    "[ vij ] this amplitude necessarily involves an exchange of quarks between the interacting mesons .",
    "thus the leading order @xmath16 interaction couples @xmath16 with hidden charm states such as @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this amplitude may be unitarized by extracting an effective potential and iterating it in a schrdinger equation@xcite .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to a variety of processes such as @xmath48 scattering@xcite and @xmath27 reactions relevant to rhic physics@xcite .",
    "it has even proven surprisingly useful for relativistic ( and chiral ) reactions such as @xmath49 scattering@xcite .    the s - wave born order scattering amplitude for @xmath50 scattering is shown in fig .",
    "[ tc ] . here",
    "@xmath14 refers to the isoscalar positive charge parity state @xmath51 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is dominated by the confinement interaction of eq .",
    "[ vij ] ( this is in contrast to light meson scattering which is dominated by the hyperfine interaction ) .",
    "an effective potential is extracted by equating the scattering amplitude to that obtained for point - like mesons interacting via an arbitrary s - wave potential .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize this potential as a sum of gaussians :    @xmath52    the fit to the quark level amplitude is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tc ] ( left panel ) and the resulting potential is shown in fig . [ tc ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the distinctive `` mermaid potential '' seen here is due to destructive interference between diagrams in the quark level amplitude .",
    "thus details of the potential are sensitive to the assumed microscopic interaction , however , its general shape and strength are quite robust@xcite .",
    "( left ) s - wave scattering amplitude for @xmath53 .",
    "( right ) effective potential for @xmath53 , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   ( left ) s - wave scattering amplitude for @xmath53 .",
    "( right ) effective potential for @xmath53 , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the derived parameters of eq .",
    "[ vq ] were @xmath54 gev , @xmath55 gev@xmath56 and @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 gev@xmath56 .",
    "these parameters were obtained for the confinement portion of the `` prior '' form of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the `` post '' form yields @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev@xmath56 , @xmath61 gev , and @xmath62 gev@xmath56 .",
    "post and prior forms of a scattering amplitude refer to different schemes for constructing the time evolution operator which exist in the scattering of composite systems . in principle",
    "these give rise to the same scattering amplitude , but approximations and inaccurate wavefunctions can cause slight differences as indicated in the figure . we employ the average potential indicated by the solid line of fig . [ tc ] ( right ) in the following .",
    "finally , the isovector @xmath16- @xmath4 effective potential is identical to its isoscalar analogue .",
    "the mermaid form of the effective potential implies that quark exchange effects can cause binding in the coupled @xmath16 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 systems ; however , direct computations indicate that the potential depth is not sufficient to form a resonance .",
    "we therefore turn to an examination of pion exchange induced dynamics in the @xmath16 system .",
    "i choose to follow the method of trnqvist@xcite in constructing an effective pion - induced interaction .",
    "this is based on a microscopic quark - pion interaction familiar from nuclear physics :    @xmath63    here @xmath64 mev is the pion decay constant , @xmath65 is an su(2 ) flavour generator , and @xmath66 is a coupling to be determined .",
    "the effective potential is derived by projecting the quark level interactions onto hadronic states in the nonrelativistic limit . in the case of pseudoscalar - vector states",
    "one obtains@xcite    @xmath67 \\label{vpi}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath68    @xmath69    and @xmath70 the matrix elements refer to s- and d - wave components of the pseudoscalar - vector state in analogy with the deuteron . the strength of the interaction has been fixed by comparing to the @xmath71 coupling constant via the relationship @xmath72 .",
    "this allows a prediction of the @xmath73 decay width which is in good agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 is typically the pion mass , however , one can incorporate recoil effects in the potential by setting @xmath75 .",
    "the results presented here are insensitive to the value of @xmath74 and i take @xmath76 mev in the following . finally , the coupling @xmath77 is a spin - flavour matrix element which takes on the following values : @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 ; @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 ; @xmath84 for @xmath82 , @xmath80 ; and @xmath85 for @xmath79 , @xmath83 .",
    "thus the isoscalar positive charge parity channel is the most likely to form bound states and subsequent discussion focusses on it .",
    "the potential of eq .",
    "[ t ] is an illegal quantum mechanical operator and must be regulated , typically with a dipole form factor .",
    "the regulator scale , @xmath86 may be fixed by comparison with nuclear physics ; for example @xmath87 interactions yield preferred values for @xmath86 in the range 0.8 gev to 1.5 gev depending on model details .",
    "alternatively , reproducing the deuteron binding energy requires @xmath88 gev .",
    "trnqvist has employed an intermediate value of @xmath89 gev which is appropriate for @xmath90 mesons and this is taken as the canonical cutoff in the following .    integrating the coupled s / d wave system for the @xmath91 @xmath92 system yields a bound state of mass 10562 mev , in agreement with ref .",
    "similarly a @xmath93 @xmath92 bound state of mass 10545 mev arises from this formalism .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath90 mesons are sufficiently light that the @xmath16 system does not bind with canonical parameters .",
    "however , the combined pion and quark induced effective interactions are sufficient to cause binding .",
    "the properties of this bound state are explored in the next section .",
    "the proceeding considerations indicate that the isoscalar positive charge conjugation sector is the most likely to bind in the @xmath16 system .",
    "furthermore the small branching fraction of the @xmath25 to @xmath95 implies a small isovector @xmath4 component in the @xmath26 wavefunction .",
    "thus a good initial study is provided by the coupled channel @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath3 system . utilizing the potentials of eqs .",
    "[ vq ] and [ vpi ] and meson masses of @xmath46 gev , @xmath98 gev , @xmath99 gev , and @xmath100 gev yields a single bound state of mass 3.872 gev without adjusting any parameters , in remarkable agreement with the mass of the @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath25 wavefunction is plotted in fig .",
    "[ wf ] ( left panel ) ; one sees typical deuteron - like wavefunctions with strong d - wave and @xmath3 components .",
    "all three components are required to achieve binding for this state .",
    "although encouraging , this result must not be taken too seriously because the binding energy is comparable to the difference in energies of the various relevant charge channels . thus isospin",
    "breaking effects are expected to be important and must be incorporated in the formalism .",
    "this is achieved by including isovector channels and allowing for differing thresholds .",
    "restricting attention to nearby vector meson - @xmath27 states and neglecting the coupling to charmonium states to charmonium states is negligible because the wavefunction squared at the origin scales as @xmath101 thereby suppressing quark annihilation transitions .",
    "annihilation is further suppressed because the @xmath25 should be dominated by s - wave quark pairs and possible charmonium states are all orbital excitations . ]",
    "yields six possible channels :    @xmath102    @xmath4 at 3.8679 gev    @xmath103 at 3.8712 gev    @xmath104 at 3.8712 gev    @xmath105 at 3.8793 gev    @xmath106 at 3.8793 gev    @xmath3 at 3.8795 gev .",
    "one sees an immediate problem : the threshold for @xmath4 is too low to allow a resonance at @xmath107 gev .",
    "however , the mass of the @xmath108 is rather poorly defined due to its large width and",
    "some leeway in fixing threshold for this channel is permissible .",
    "i therefore adopt the simple prescription of setting the @xmath108 mass equal to that of the @xmath109 at @xmath110 gev .",
    "varying this prescription made negligible changes to the following results .",
    "the quark level coupling of @xmath111 states to s - wave @xmath108- or @xmath109-@xmath27 states is small and is neglected . the final step is to form effective interactions from appropriate combinations of isospin basis interactions .",
    "for example the @xmath112 interaction is given by eq .",
    "[ vpi ] with @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting numerical six channel problem must be studied with some care because the binding energies are small relative to the natural scales of the system .",
    "it is of interest to study the properties of possible bound states as a function of their binding energy .",
    "this has been achieved by allowing the regulator scale to vary between 1.2 and 2.3 gev .",
    "binding is seen to occur for @xmath86 larger than approximately 1.45 gev .",
    "wavefunction coefficients ( defined as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a channel index ) are shown as a function of binding energy in fig .",
    "[ wf ] ( right panel ) .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath2 component dominates the wavefunction , especially near threshold .",
    "however , the @xmath115 component rises rapidly in strength with isospin symmetry being recovered at surprisingly small binding energies ( on the order of 30 mev ) .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath3 component peaks at roughly 17% at @xmath116 mev . the contribution of the @xmath4 wavefunction remains small , peaking at less than 1% very close to threshold .",
    "( left ) three channel isoscalar wavefunction components .",
    "( right ) component strength vs. binding energy.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   ( left ) three channel isoscalar wavefunction components .",
    "( right ) component strength vs. binding energy.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    it is possible to estimate decay rates in a simple fashion once an explicit wavefunction is known .",
    "this is because the small binding energy of the @xmath25 implies that its constituent particles are nearly on - shell and therefore @xmath26 decay amplitudes are well approximated by constituent decay amplitudes .",
    "thus , for example , the @xmath9 decay mode arises predominantly from the @xmath4 wavefunction component .",
    "the channel strengths of fig .",
    "[ wf ] therefore allow simple estimates of a variety of branching fractions based on the widths of the @xmath73 , @xmath109 , and @xmath108 ( decays of the @xmath90 and @xmath27 mesons are neglected here but can be computed easily ) . the results for a variety of modes are presented in table i as a function of the binding energy .",
    "the broadest particle in the @xmath25 system is the @xmath108 with a width of 150 mev and it is the @xmath4 component which has the largest branching fraction , even though it is strongly suppressed in the wavefunction .",
    "the next strongest mode is provided by the @xmath117 decay of the @xmath109 which is enhanced relative to other modes due to strong mixing with @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , only a very rough upper limit on the total width of the @xmath118 exists@xcite so estimates of the @xmath119 and @xmath120 decay widths are essentially useless .",
    "the figures in the table have been obtained by assuming that @xmath121 kev and @xmath122 kev ; both of these estimates are anchored in @xmath123 decays and should be reliable .",
    "notice that the @xmath124 mode is closed .",
    "all other possible decay modes of the @xmath25 are relatively small , although the @xmath125 mode may be of interest if it is detectable .",
    ".some decay modes of the @xmath24 ( kev ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "i have argued that the @xmath0 is a @xmath126 @xmath16 hadronic resonance with important admixtures of @xmath4 and @xmath3 states , dubbed the @xmath25 .",
    "this assertion is supported by detailed computations in a microscopic model which incorporates pion and quark exchange interactions .",
    "the model has been heavily tested on nuclear physics and meson - meson scattering data and can be regarded as reasonably reliable .",
    "the @xmath91 @xmath25 is the only @xmath16 state which binds ; no other @xmath127 or charge modes exist in this model .",
    "furthermore , no @xmath128 molecules are expected .",
    "it is likely , however , that a rich @xmath129 , @xmath92 and @xmath130 spectrum exists .",
    "thus the discovery of the @xmath0 may be the entree into a new regime of hadronic physics which will offer important insight into the workings of strong qcd and should help clarify many open issues in light quark spectroscopy .",
    "indeed , the experimental and theoretical analysis of heavy molecules is simplified because of their hidden flavour components .",
    "it is clear that further experimental studies of the @xmath0 are of great importance .",
    "for example , determining its spin and parity are of immediate concern . the fact that the @xmath15 is polarized in @xmath131",
    "will help greatly in this . furthermore , detecting a @xmath132 decay mode would immediately eliminate the @xmath25 interpretation of the @xmath15 .",
    "it is also important to gather enough events to reconstruct the invariant mass of various subsystems such as @xmath133 in @xmath9 ( which should peak at the @xmath108 mass ) .",
    "perhaps a more interesting test would be the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath117 subsystem in the @xmath134 decay mode , which should have all of its events near the edge of phase space due to the narrow width of the virtual @xmath109 .",
    "it is therefore encouraging that the @xmath135 decay mode is roughly 1/2 the strength of the @xmath136 mode .",
    "although some events will be lost due to the decreased efficiency in detecting neutral pions , this deficit should be made up by the new data being collected at belle and babar .",
    "lastly , determining branching fractions , especially those arising from different wavefunction components such as @xmath119 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , would help greatly in pinning down the internal structure of the @xmath15 and provide an intriguing glimpse into a new realm of hadronic physics .",
