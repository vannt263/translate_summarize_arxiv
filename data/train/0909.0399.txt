    "systematic deep photometric observations of the surroundings of the andromeda galaxy have revolutionized our knowledge of its satellite system . before 2004 , 12 dwarf galaxies were known to be m31 companions , including only 6 dwarf spheroidal galaxies , while 12 new dwarf galaxies have been discovered to inhabit this region of the local group sky over the last five years . a dedicated scan of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , targeting a region within @xmath4 of m31 s major axis , unveiled the presence of andromeda  ix and  x @xcite . in parallel , a contiguous mapping of the region within @xmath5 of andromeda , performed with the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope , revealed the picture of a strikingly substructured inner stellar halo @xcite , and led to the discovery of andromeda  xvii @xcite .    mapping the outer regions of m31 s",
    "halo was the goal of an extension to this survey .",
    "performed with the megaprime / megacam @xmath6 camera on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , it mapped a quarter of the m31 stellar halo , out to @xmath7 @xcite . confirming the clumpy nature of andromeda s stellar halo , the survey has also revealed the presence of numerous other dwarf galaxies : andromeda  xi , xii , xiii , xv , xvi , xviii , xix and  xx @xcite . at about the same time",
    ", andromeda  xiv was discovered serendipitously by @xcite , just outside of the edge of the megacam survey .",
    "our understanding of these systems remains sparse , mainly due to the distance at which they reside , translating into difficult photometric observations that can not easily reach much deeper than the horizontal branch at the distance of m31 .",
    "spectroscopic observations are also limited to the handful of bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars that can be targeted in each system .",
    "although progress is expected along these lines in the coming years , much can already be said of the generic properties of these new objects from the current survey data alone .",
    "their absolute magnitude ranges from a very faint @xmath8 for and  xii and and  xx @xcite to a surprisingly bright @xmath9 for and  xviii @xcite , patently showing the incompleteness of the m31 satellite luminosity function at the faint end , in regions that have so far only been surveyed with photographic plates .",
    "given their relative faintness and significant sizes , these new systems are usually assumed to be dwarf spheroidal galaxies , in other words dwarf galaxies that are devoid of any significant amount of gas .",
    "this is currently consistent with the analysis of hi surveys but the upper limits on their hi content remains relatively high ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it can not be entirely ruled out that some of these galaxies still contain non - negligeable amounts of gas .",
    "building upon the previous megacam survey , we have initiated the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ) , a large program using the cfht megacam imager to map the entire stellar halo of m31 and m33 out to distances of @xmath11 and @xmath5 respectively . here",
    ", we report on the discovery of two new dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the andromeda and triangulum galaxies based on the first year of pandas data .",
    "these systems , dubbed andromeda  xxi and  xxii are sparse but unmistakable overdensities of stars that are also aligned along a rgb at the distance of m31 .",
    "section  2 of this paper briefly summarizes the pandas data while section  3 presents the new systems and details their properties .",
    "section  4 briefly discusses the new discoveries and section  5 concludes the paper .    throughout this paper , the distance moduli of m31 and m33",
    "are assumed to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively @xcite .",
    "pandas builds upon our previous cfht / megacam surveys of m31 whose results are presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use a similar observational set - up and refer the reader to these papers for a description of the observing strategy , data reduction and data quality .",
    "maps showing early results and the complete survey area to date can be found in @xcite and led to the discovery of and  xxi and and  xxii .",
    "the survey consists of contiguous exposures , performed with the @xmath16 deg@xmath17 megaprime / megacam camera mounted on the cfht .",
    "the camera is a mosaic of 36 @xmath18 ccds with a pixel size of 0.187arsec .",
    "small gaps within the survey lead to a scientifically useable field - of - view of @xmath19 for each of the current 250pointings of the survey .",
    "each field has been observed for 1350s in each of the megacam @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters , split into @xmath22s dithered subexposures .",
    "good seeing ( @xmath23 ) ensures that the photometry reaches @xmath24 and @xmath25 with a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 and guarantees that the star / galaxy separation only degrades at magnitudes fainter than @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "data were preprocessed ( de - biased , flat - fielded and fringe corrected ) by the elixir system at cfht that also determines the photometric zero point of the observations , and then processed using a version of the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) photometry pipeline @xcite , adapted to cfht / megacam observations .",
    "the pipeline registers and stacks the images , and also generates catalogues with object morphological classification before creating band - merged @xmath20 , @xmath21 products .    in the following ,",
    "dereddened magnitudes ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) have been determined from the @xcite @xmath30 extinction maps , using the following correction coefficients : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , listed in their table  6 .",
    "two new dwarf galaxies were directly identified on matched - filter surface density maps of rgb candidate stars selected to have colors consistent with the average ( generally ) metal - poor locus of m31 dwarf spheroidals .",
    "satellites in the very sparsely populated outer halo regions correspond to stellar overdensities that are striking enough for them to be easily spotted , even down to magnitudes of @xmath33 .",
    "this was the case for and  xii @xcite and and  xx @xcite and also here with andromeda  xxii .",
    "an automated search is certainly warranted to better quantify the detection limits of the survey in uncovering new dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this initial discovery paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "map of dwarf galaxies located in the surroundings of m31 and m33 .",
    "m31 is located at the center of the coordinate system and known satellites are represented by empty circles .",
    "the two new discoveries , and  xxi and and  xxii , are represented by filled circles . the current extent of the pandas survey",
    "is shown as dotted squares , with each square representing a single @xmath34 megacam field .",
    "the ellipse represents the extent of m31 s hi disk .",
    "constellation boundaries , taken from @xcite , are shown as thin lines . ]",
    "the locations of the two new satellites are shown on the map of the pandas survey ( figure  [ map ] ) . as with many previous detections ,",
    "these two systems are noticeably close to the edge of the survey , suggesting that the survey limit of @xmath35 in projected distance from m31 does not represent the true extent of andromeda s satellite system ( see also figure  2 of @xcite ) . in the spirit of previous conventions ,",
    "we dub these two satellites andromeda  xxi and andromeda  xxii ( and  xxi and and  xxii ; see the discussion below , in appendix  [ naming_conventions ] ) .",
    "both systems appear as overdensities of stars on the sky , as is visible in the left panels of figures  [ map_andxxi ] and  [ map_andxxii ] .",
    "these stars are also aligned along a rgb that would be at , or close to , the distance of m31 or m33 .",
    "the cmds within 2 half - light radii of the dwarfs ( determined in   [ strparam ] below ) are shown in the middle panels of these figures and , when compared to the cmd of reference fields chosen in an annulus covering the same area at a distance of @xmath36 from the dwarfs centers ( right panels ) , indeed reveal an alignment of stars that follow the typical shape of a rgb . isolating these stars enhances the contrast of the overdensity of stars on the sky ( large symbols in the left panels ) .    and",
    "xxi is typical of the relatively bright dwarf galaxies that we have found before ( such as and  xv or and  xvi ) .",
    "the overdensity of stars in the cmd region @xmath37 and @xmath38 corresponds to its horizontal branch but the degrading star / galaxy separation at these magnitudes , as well as the rapidly dropping completeness , makes it difficult to extract any accurate information from this region of the cmd . with only @xmath39stars visible along its rgb , and",

    "<S> we present the discovery of two new dwarf galaxies , andromeda  xxi and andromeda  xxii , located in the surroundings of the andromeda and triangulum galaxies ( m31 and m33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these discoveries stem from the first year data of the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ) , a photometric survey of the m31/m33 group conducted with the megaprime / megacam wide - field camera mounted on the canada - france - hawaii telescope . </S>",
    "<S> both satellites appear as spatial overdensities of stars which , when plotted in a color - magnitude diagram , follow metal - poor , @xmath0 , red giant branches at the distance of m31/m33 . andromeda  xxi is a moderately bright dwarf galaxy ( @xmath1 ) , albeit with low surface brightness , emphasizing again that many relatively luminous m31 satellites still remain to be discovered . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a large satellite , with a half - light radius close to @xmath2 , making it the fourth largest local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy after the recently discovered andromeda  xix , andromeda  ii and sagittarius around the milky way , and supports the trend that m31 satellites are larger than their milky way counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> andromeda  xxii is much fainter ( @xmath3 ) and lies a lot closer in projection to m33 than it does to m31 ( 42 vs. 224 ) , suggesting that it could be the first triangulum satellite to be discovered . </S>",
    "<S> although this is a very exciting possibility in the context of a past interaction of m33 with m31 and the fate of its satellite system , a confirmation will have to await a good distance estimate to confirm its physical proximity to m33 . </S>",
    "<S> along with the dwarf galaxies found in previous surveys of the m31 surroundings , these two new satellites bring the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region to 20 . </S>"
