    "collective synchronization is an ubiquitous phenomenon that pervades nature at every scale , and underlies essential processes of life ; it is a central process observed in a spectacular range of systems , such as pendulum clocks  @xcite , pedestrians on a bridge locking their gait  @xcite , josephson junctions  @xcite , the beating of the heart  @xcite , circadian clocks in the brain  @xcite , chemical oscillations  @xcite , metabolic oscillations in yeast  @xcite , life cycles of phytoplankton  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "synchronized oscillations have received particular attention in neuroscience because they are prominent in the cortex of the awake brain during attention and are believed to be involved in higher level processes , such as sensory binding , awareness , memory storage and replay , and even consciousness  @xcite . from the clinical point of view , abnormal synchronization seems to play a crucial role in neural disorders such as parkinson , epilepsy and essential tremor  @xcite .    about a decade ago",
    ", a peculiar state was theoretically revealed  @xcite , where a population of identical coupled oscillators can split up into two parts where one part synchronizes and the other oscillates incoherently .",
    "this so - called chimera state is counter - intuitive as it appears even when the oscillators are identical , but , since its discover , this state has become a relevant subject of investigation for experimental and theoretical scientists active in different fields ranging from laser dynamics to chemical oscillators , from mechanical pendula to ( computational ) neuroscience . in particular chimera states have been shown to emerge in various numerical / theoretical studies  @xcite and in various experimental settings , including mechanical  @xcite , ( electro-)chemical  @xcite lasing systems  @xcite and bold fmri signals detection during resting state activity  @xcite , among others .",
    "therefore chimera states are an ubiquitous phenomenon in nature much like synchronization itself and may often have been overlooked or dismissed in previous studies .",
    "a categorization of different behaviors shown by incoherent oscillators in chimera states has seen the emergence of almost regular macroscopic dynamics which are either stationary , periodic ( so - called breathing chimera ) or even quasi - periodic  @xcite .",
    "only recently , spatio - temporally chaotic chimeras have been numerically identified in coupled oscillators on ring networks  @xcite and in globally connected populations of pulse - coupled oscillators  @xcite . however , a detailed characterization of the dynamical properties of these states have been reported only for the former case , more specifically , for rings of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators : in this case chimeras are transient , and _ weakly chaotic _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the life - times of these states diverge exponentially with the system size , while their dynamics becomes regular in the thermodynamic limit .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "it has been shown that a simple model of coupled oscillators with inertia ( rotators ) can reproduce dynamical behaviours found experimentally for two coupled populations of mechanical pendula .",
    "starting from these results , the present paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the collective states emerging in such model of symmetrically coupled rotators , for different inertia values and sizes . for small inertia values breathing and quasiperiodic chimeras",
    "coexist with the synchronized state , while two chaotic solutions emerge for sufficiently large inertia : the chaotic chimera , characterized by a synchronized and a chaotic population , and a state where both populations are chaotic , but with two distinct macroscopic attractors .",
    "while the last chimeras are stationary states , the former ones are characterized by a finite life - time , whose duration diverges as a power - law with the system size and the inertia . on one hand",
    "the chaotic population exhibits clear intermittent behavior between a laminar and a turbulent phase ; in particular , in the turbulent regime , the lyapunov analysis reveals that the stability properties of chaotic chimeras can be ascribed to the universality class of globally coupled systems  @xcite . on the other hand , in the two chaotic population states ,",
    "the most part of neurons belong to an unique cluster and the chaotic evolution is driven only by the oscillators out of the cluster .",
    "moreover , a numerical extension of the zero - inertia solution has been performed , starting from a stationary chimera state , characterized by a synchronized and a partially synchronized population , where both order parameters are constant . due to the introduction of the inertia ,",
    "the order parameter of the partially synchronized population is no longer constant but it oscillates periodically about the zero - inertia limit value .",
    "therefore , in presence of inertia , stationary chimeras are any longer observed ; only breathing and quasiperiodic chimeras emerge .",
    "in particular in sec . ii we will introduce the model , the order parameters employed to characterize the level of coherence in the system , and we will describe our simulation protocols as well as the linearized system . in sec .",
    "iii we will analyze the different stationary states emerging in the system for different inertia values and different initial conditions . in sec . iv we will report the stability properties of the intermittent chaotic chimera emerging at sufficiently large inertia value . in sec .",
    "v the microscopic dynamics of the two chaotic population state is deeply investigated . finally , the reported results are briefly summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "the finite size scaling of the maximal lyapunov exponent is reported in appendix a , while in the appendix b the linear stability of the synchronized state is presented .",
    "we consider a network of two symmetrically coupled populations of @xmath0 rotators , each characterized by a phase @xmath1 and a frequency @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the population .",
    "the phase @xmath1 of the @xmath4-th oscillator in population @xmath5 evolves according to the differential equation @xmath6 where the oscillators are assumed to be identical with inertia @xmath7 , natural frequency @xmath8 and a fixed phase lag @xmath9 .",
    "the self- ( cross- ) coupling among oscillators belonging to the same population ( to different populations ) is defined as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , with @xmath12 without loss of generality .",
    "we follow previous studies on chimera states  @xcite and impose an imbalance between intra- and inter - population interactions quantified by @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , uniform coupling is achieved when @xmath15 , whereas the populations are disconnected for @xmath16 . in the following analysis @xmath17",
    "will be kept equal to 0.2 .",
    "we consider only two types of initial conditions : uniform ( ucs ) or with broken symmetry ( bscs ) . in the former case",
    "both populations are initialized with random values ; in the last case the populations are initialized differently : one population is initialized in a fully synchronized state and it has a set of identical initial values for both phases and frequencies ( namely , @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , while the phases and frequencies of the second population can be initialized either with random values or with equispaced values taken from the intervals @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the bscs can lead to the emergence of intermittent chaotic chimeras ( iccs ) , a broken symmetry state where one population is fully synchronized and the other behaves chaotically .",
    "in particular this state exhibits turbulent phases interrupted by laminar regimes . on the other hand",
    "the ucs can lead to the emergence of chaotic two populations states ( c2p ) , broken symmetry states where both populations display chaotic behavior taking place on different attractors .",
    "the collective evolution of each population will be characterized in terms of the macroscopic fields @xmath22 the modulus @xmath23 is an order parameter for the synchronization transition being one ( @xmath24 ) for synchronous ( asynchronous ) states .",
    "in general we will perform sequences of simulations by varying adiabatically the inertia value @xmath7 with two different protocols .",
    "namely , for the first protocol , the series of simulations is initialized from zero - inertia solutions corresponding to stationary chimera states for two coupled population of kuramoto oscillators @xcite . starting from these initial conditions ,",
    "the solutions are continued to a finite inertia value by employing eq .",

    "moreover , the occurrence of intermittent laminar and turbulent phases , observable for iccs , renders the characterization of the chaoticity of the system in terms of the asymptotic maximal le extremely difficult .",
