    "the driven - diffusive lattice gas models are of current interest in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite . depending on the nature of the drive",
    ", these driven - dissipative systems can attain steady - states that are far from equilibrium . the simplest driven - diffusive lattice gas model that incorporates inter - particle interactions",
    "is the katz - lebowitz - spohn model @xcite ( from now onwards referred to as * kls * ) .",
    "some of the particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic @xcite are closely related to some special limits of the kls model in one dimension .",
    "therefore , in order to compare and contrast the spatio - temporal organizations and the flow properties of the kls model with those in the particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic , we calculate here those properties of the kls model which are important from the perspective of vehicular traffic .    over the last decade",
    "extensive investigations of vehicular traffic have been made using the so - called particle - hopping models which represent each vehicle by a particle @xcite .",
    "all these traffic models are defined on discrete lattices each site of which , in the spirit of the lattice gas models , represents a cell that can accommodate at most one particle at a time . in almost all the standard particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic",
    "the only non - vanishing inter - particle interaction is the mutual hard - core repulsion which is usually implemented through the condition of exclusion principle : no two particles are allowed to occupy the same lattice site simultaneously .",
    "therefore , a comparison of our results on the kls model with the corresponding results for the particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic will show the effects of inter - particle interactions other than mere hard - core repulsion .    the * flux * ( per lane ) is defined to be the number of particles ( per lane ) crossing a detector site per unit time . in the context of vehicular traffic @xcite , the most important quantity of interest is the so - called _ fundamental relation _ which depicts the dependence of the flux on the density of the vehicles .",
    "the number of empty sites in between a pair of particles is usually taken as a measure of the corresponding distance - headway * dh*.    in this paper we theoretically calculate the dh distributions and the flux in the steady - states of the kls model , separately for attractive and repulsive inter - particle interactions , within the framework of a _ cluster mean - field theory _ ( * mft * ) @xcite which has been very successful also in the theoretical treatment of the particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic @xcite .",
    "we also indicate the level of the accuracy of our cluster - mft results by comparing these with the corresponding numerical data obtained from our computer simulations of the kls model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section ii we define the kls model and some related particle - hopping models which are relevant for our discussion in the subsequent sections .",
    "we summarize in section iii the methods of the cluster mft we use for our theoretical calculations as well as those of computer simulation . in sections iv , v and vi , we present our theoretical results for the one - dimensional kls model ( both with attractive and repulsive interactions ) in the @xmath2-cluster , @xmath3-cluster and @xmath4-cluster approximations , respectively , together with the corresponding numerical data from our computer simulations .",
    "we present our results for the two - dimensional kls model in section vii .",
    "we compare and contrast the results for the kls model with the corresponding results for the particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic in section viii before summarizing the main results in the concluding section ix .",
    "suppose the variable @xmath5 describes the state of occupation of the site @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) on a discrete lattice ; @xmath5 is allowed to take one of the only two values , namely , @xmath8 if the site @xmath6 is occupied by a particle and @xmath9 if it is empty ( or , equivalently , occupied by a  hole \" ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system , in the absence of any external driving field , is given by @xmath10 where the summation on the right hand side is to be carried out over all the nearest - neighbor pairs and @xmath11 takes into account the corresponding inter - particle interactions .",
    "the kls model can be recast in the language commonly used in the theory of magnetism by using classical ising spin variables @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the particles and holes , respectively , and the corresponding hamiltonian , in the absence of the external drive , is given by @xmath15 the _ attractive _ and _ repulsive _ inter - particle interactions , captured by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , in the hamiltonian ( [ eq-1 ] ) correspond to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in the form ( [ eq-2 ] ) of the hamiltonian .",

    "the dynamical cluster mft has been used successfully in the analytical treatments of several non - equilibrium models including , for example , surface - reaction models @xcite and particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic @xcite . however , in all the traffic models there is no inter - particle interaction except , of course , the hard - core repulsion . moreover , unlike the traffic models , the particles in the kls model can also move against the drive .    in this paper",
    "we extend the approach in appropriate manner to calculate the flux @xmath56 as a function of @xmath25 in the kls model for arbitrary @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we define a @xmath0-cluster ( @xmath60 ) to be a collection of @xmath0 sites each of which is the nearest - neighbor of at least another site belonging to the same cluster . for simplicity of notation ,",
    "let us consider @xmath43 .",
    "we denote the probability of finding an @xmath0-cluster in the state @xmath61 at time @xmath18 by the symbol @xmath62 .",

    ". however , the the master equation governing the time evolution of the @xmath4-cluster probabilities @xmath69 involve @xmath72-cluster probabilities , and so on . a few concrete examples of such exact master equations for @xmath0-cluster probabilities are given in the appendix a. in the spirit of the cluster - mean - field approach , we truncate this hierarchy of exact master equations by expressing , albeit approximately , all the @xmath63-cluster probabilities in terms of the @xmath0-cluster probabilities .    according to the definition of dh , the probability for a dh of @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 we evaluate the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq - dh1 ] ) in the @xmath3-cluster and @xmath4-cluster approximations .      in our computer simulations , we begin with initial conditions where the particles are arranged randomly on a lattice of linear size @xmath20 ( i.e. , the system is a linear chain of size @xmath20 in @xmath43 and square lattice of size @xmath29 in @xmath53 ) .",
    "the system is then allowed to evolve , following the kawasaki exchange algorithm with the metropolis probabilities min@xmath75 $ ] mentioned above , for time steps of the order of @xmath76 , so as to allow it to reach its steady - state and , then , for further @xmath77 steps during which the time - averaged flux is measured . finally , for the same set of values of the parameters , this process is repeated for @xmath78 different initial configurations to compute the configuration - averaged flux .",
    "since we did not observe any significant difference between the results for @xmath79 and @xmath80 in @xmath43 and between those for @xmath81 and @xmath82 in @xmath44 all the data presented in this paper were generated using @xmath79 in @xmath43 and @xmath83 in @xmath44 .",
    "it has been realized for some time @xcite that the smallest cluster one must consider in a dynamical cluster mft depends on the nature of the dynamics .",
    "since the kawasaki dynamics conserves the number of particles , in principle , the smallest cluster must consist of at least one _ pair _ of sites .",
    "however , it is also known that for the @xmath50 limit of the kls model , which is exactly identical with the tasep ( with @xmath52 ) , the single - site mft gives the exact result .",
    "therefore , in this short section we not only establish explicitly the limitations of the @xmath2-cluster mft at weak @xmath40 but also demonstrate how the accuracy of the @xmath2-cluster mft increases with increasing @xmath40 in the kls model in @xmath43 .",
    "the net flux is obtained from @xmath84 where the forward flux ( i.e. , flux in the direction of @xmath36 ) is given by @xmath85 while the reverse flux ( i.e. , the flux against @xmath36 ) is given by @xmath86    in the @xmath2-cluster approximation the @xmath4-cluster probabilities @xmath87 are approximated by the products of corresponding @xmath2-cluster probabilities .",

    "thus , fig.[fig-1 ] establishes the existence of strong correlations which are neglected by the @xmath2-cluster mft .",
    "in the @xmath3-cluster approximation , we approximate the @xmath4-cluster probabilities , appearing in the exact master equation for the 2-cluster probabilities , by a product of @xmath3-cluster probabilities , i.e. , @xmath104 or , more precisely , @xmath105 next , we parametrize the @xmath3-cluster probabilities as follows : + @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 this parametrization enables us to satisfy the three constraints @xcite namely , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",

    "finally , in the @xmath3-cluster mft , the forward flux and the reverse flux are given by @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively ; the net flux is obtained from @xmath84 .    in the next few subsections",
    "we compare the predictions of this @xmath3-cluster mft with the corresponding numerical data obtained from our extensive computer simulations of the kls model .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that at an infinitely high temperature the expressions ( [ eq-20 ] ) and ( [ eq-21 ] ) for @xmath128 and @xmath129 become identical and , therefore , the net flux vanishes ; hign temperature not only washes away the effects of @xmath11 , as it is known to do even in equilibrium , but also the effects of @xmath40 making particle movement in both directions equally probable .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the flux as a function of the particle density @xmath25 , at a fixed non - zero finite temperature @xmath30 , for five different values of @xmath40 ; the agreement between the theoretical prediction and computer simulation is very good for both attractive ( fig.2a ) as well as repulsive ( fig.2b ) interactions .",
    "the @xmath93 curves are the analogues of the fundamental relations for the traffic models .",
    "the shape of the curve @xmath93 in the kls model with _ attractive _ ( @xmath16 ) is qualitatively similar to those observed in the particle - hopping models of vehicular traffic . in sharp contrast",
    ", we find a qualitatively different shape of the curve @xmath93 in the kls model with _ repulsive _ interactions ( @xmath17 ) ; there is a minimum , rather than maximum , at @xmath130 provided the strength of @xmath11 is comparable to that of @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , for the same @xmath30 and @xmath40 , the flux is higher in the case of _ repulsive _ inter - particle interactions than that in the case of _ attractive _ inter - particle interactions . nevertheless , because of the particle - hole symmetry , the curves in both the figures [ fig-2](a ) and ( b ) are symmetric about @xmath130 irrespective of the sign of the inter - particle interactions .     with the density @xmath25 of the particles in the _ steady - state _ of the one - dimensional kls model with ( a ) attractive interaction @xmath94 and ( b ) repulsive interaction @xmath95 , both at @xmath96",

    "also note that in both the figures [ fig-2](a ) and ( b ) @xmath131 as @xmath50 . this is a consequence of the fact that , as stated before , the kls model reduces to the asep , with @xmath52 , in the limit @xmath50 ( in both the cases of attractive and repulsive inter - particle interactions ) as long as @xmath11 and @xmath30 remain finite .",
    "in fact , in all the figures [ fig-1](a ) , ( b ) and [ fig-2](a ) , ( b ) , the full curve @xmath132 is given by exact expression @xmath133 .",
