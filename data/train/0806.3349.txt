    "it was shown that an exciton can be formed under a strong long - ranged particle - hole interaction@xcite .",
    "exciton can also be formed in a single - layer graphene through the mechanism of magnetic catalysis of dynamical mass generation as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this work showed that the magnetic catalysis can induce exciton condensation even for weak particle - hole coupling @xcite .",

    "self - consistent exciton gap equations are derived in the framework of hartree - fock approximation and it is shown that a critical strength of the coulomb interaction exists for the formation of excitons .",
    "the critical strength depends on the amount of voltage difference between the layers and on the inter - layer hopping parameter .",
    "the voltage difference drives a gap in the energy spectrum of the graphene bilayer @xcite and combined to a strong coulomb interaction leads to an exciton instability .",

    "indeed quasiparticle in 2d systems can acquire mass through dynamical interaction between electrons and holes leading to an increase of the energy gap @xcite .",
    "we address the question : can a kekule distortion affect the dynamical mass generation mechanism in such a way that the resulting energy gap favors the formation of excitons ? we show that in the specific case of an homogeneous kekule distortion and at the one - loop approximation the dynamical mass generation is unaffected by the lattice distortion .",
    "we show that the gap in the energy spectrum is a sum of two independent contributions : one induced by the homogeneous kekule distortion and one induced by dynamical mass generation .",
