    "it has long been speculated that qubits based on individual electron spins in si quantum dots ( qds ) have considerable potential for quantum information processing .",

    "physical implementations of esr on individual bound electronic spins have proven to be successful in gaas - based qds transport experiments @xcite , where the essential role of the spin ( pauli ) blockade and the nuclear spin bath in that systems were established .",
    "however , spin detection via electronic transport in gate defined si qds has remained challenging .    here , we report the detection of microwave driven electron spin resonance transport of individual electrons in a silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) based dqd .",
    "the lifting of the blockade via esr is detectable only in a narrow region where zeeman split spin states of different valley content anticross where the zeeman splitting @xmath3 equals the valley splitting of @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the anticrossing is due to spin - orbit coupling in the heterostructure , in the presence of interface roughness , that mixes spin and valley states ( similar mixing mechanism was first established in the electron spin relaxation in a small single si quantum dot@xcite ) .",
    "the gap at anticrossing of @xmath5 is a measure of this spin - valley mixing and also provides a means to access higher valley states via esr .",
    "analysis of the esr spectrum provides a lower - bound estimation of an inhomogeneous decoherence time , @xmath6 , which is much longer than that in gaas @xcite ; it also compares well to the direct measurement of @xmath2 for a si qubit encoded by singlet - triplet states @xcite .",
    "the nature of the experimental blockade regime , and its dependence on the applied magnetic field and interdot energy detuning is discussed .",
    "since the observed blockade region @xmath7 includes detunings larger than the valley splitting we can conclude that a spin - valley blockade takes place , related to the impossibility for an inelastic ( via phonons ) electron tunneling to happen .",
    "this blockade survives even in the presence of a non - ideal interface .",

    "the line width of the esr peak would be determined by the nuclear field fluctuation , assuming that this mechanism dominates . the narrowest esr line below the saturation we observed is around @xmath68 , giving an estimated nuclear hf field ( in @xmath69-direction ) in a single dot @xmath70 .",
    "this value gives a lower bound for the inhomogeneously broadened spin dephasing time ( assuming a singlet - triplet qubit ) @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the reduced planck constant ) , which is significantly longer than that measured in gaas dqd system ( @xmath73 ) via free induction decay @xcite .",

    "the anticrossing position ( corresponding to an energy difference of @xmath80 ) is determined to be independent of the interdot detuning @xmath81 ( e.g. , in the range of @xmath82 the anticrossing frequency does not shift at different detunings within an error bar of @xmath83 ) .",
    "the size of the anticrossing gap can be readily obtained from the f - b diagram to be about @xmath84 .",
    "similar esr anticrossing features were observed for a different biasing triangle than that mentioned on fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c , ( see supplementary note 3 ) .",
    "since the experiment involves two coupled quantum dots , at first sight , one would relate the anticrossing feature with the level crossing of , e.g. , the @xmath48 and @xmath42 states at finite magnetic field , if a spin - orbit interaction would dominate the anticrossing @xcite .",
    "however , the independence on detuning rules out this possibility , as such crossing would be a strong function of detuning @xcite .",
    "therefore , to explain the anticrossing one should only include the states with the same charge configuration .",
    "because the independency on detuning of the anticrossing , we will identify it as due to anticrossing of singlet and triplet @xmath16 states of _ different _ valley content .",

    "since the source - drain voltage is large , @xmath106 , all @xmath16 states are loaded , and the esr resonance transport takes place for the different groups of transitions .",
    "the mixing mechanism of different spin - valley states is due to the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the presence of non - ideal @xmath50 interface @xcite ; here it can be parameterized by only two dipole matrix elements @xmath107 where @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) is the dresselhaus ( rashba ) soc parameter ( also , valley splitting may be different in the right / left dot ) , @xmath110 is the transverse effective mass for conduction electrons , and , e.g. , @xmath111 is the wave function of an electron confined in the right dot @xcite .",
    "we note that for an ideally flat interface the above matrix elements ( m.e . )",
    "are exactly zero . however , in the presence of disorder / roughness the valley envelop functions of both valleys are perturbed @xcite , providing non - zero dipole matrix elements ; the latter just parameterize the presence of a kind of roughness , i.e. a non - flat interface , atomic steps , or defects .",
    "the splitting at anticrossing is directly observable via esr , and ( for @xmath112 ) is given by @xmath113 providing a dipole m.e . , @xmath114 , of the order of @xmath115 for the measured gap ( see supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "we note that the same matrix elements were recently shown to be responsible for spin - valley mixing and fast ( phonon ) relaxation of spin states at the so - called `` hot spot '' in a single @xmath50 qd @xcite ( see also recent calculations of such m.e .",
    "that confirm their order of magnitude value , by modeling the interface roughness with single atomic steps at the qd interface @xcite ) .",
    "the description of the esr and the spin blockade , in general , are more involved since @xmath16 states of various valley content are loaded , starting from a @xmath41 state . for a fixed external magnetic field",
    "there are several transitions in resonance with the ac oscillating magnetic field , fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b . for the direction of the magnetic field chosen in the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) the ac hamiltonian is : @xmath116 \\otimes { \\rm i}^{\\rm v_i v_j}$ ] , and couples triplet states within each valley subspace ( both the ac and nuclear hf interaction do not mix different valley subspaces ) .",
    "therefore , the ac coupling between each pair of resonant eigenstates will be dependent on the projection of these states to the corresponding triplets , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , making some of the transitions suppressed .",
    "the contribution to the esr signal of the valley subspaces @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath37 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b ) is similar to that in a gaas dqd @xcite while in a regime where nuclear hf mixing is suppressed . even in the absence of ( random )",
    "nuclear hf field mixing of @xmath119-@xmath120 states , the spin - valley mixing mechanism allows a finite esr signal to be observed .",
    "e.g. , for the spin - blocked state @xmath121 , a resonant esr transition to the upper state is possible , since it is a coherent mixture of the states @xmath122 and @xmath99 at the anticrossing spot i ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b ) .",
    "thus , the esr leakage current will increase at anticrossing due to relative increase of a singlet ( or triplet , see below ) state , that can tunnel inelastically to a @xmath17 state . since the size of the splitting of @xmath0 is equivalent to an `` effective magnetic field '' of @xmath123 ,",
    "this explains qualitatively that the observed esr signal is as strong as for gaas dqds , even though the nuclear hf field in si is two orders of magnitude smaller than in gaas . out of anticrossing the esr signal decreases as well as",
    "the @xmath119-@xmath120 mixing ; numerically , e.g. , for the lowest hybridized state @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b ) a ten times smaller admixing of non - blocked states ( @xmath99 , @xmath125 in this case ) corresponds to zeeman detuning @xmath126 , explaining a `` bright esr range '' of @xmath127 ) , comparable to the experimentally observed range , fig .  [ fig:5]a .",
    "another mechanism of esr signal suppression ( especially of the sloped esr line ) is due to the finite exchange energy splitting .",
    "a finite exchange splitting , @xmath128 , lifts the singlet - triplet degeneracy for each group of valley states , far from the anticrossing region , and forms eigenstates ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b ) , where some of them will be blocked . for a coherent tunneling of @xmath129",
    "the estimated exchange splitting is in the range of @xmath130 , so it is much larger than the nuclear hf energy in si , @xmath131 .",
    "( even though we do not measure @xmath89 directly , a situation when @xmath132 is unlikely , since in this case the esr suppression out of anticrossing can not be explained , see supplementary note 3 ) .",
    "thus , the standard mechanism of a @xmath119-@xmath120 mixing via the hf field will be energetically suppressed far from anticrossing for the @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] valley states , and so its corresponding contribution to the observed esr signal .    since in the esr transport experiment",
    "upper valley states are loaded , one need to consider one more mechanism of esr signal suppression .",
    "we assume that within the @xmath87 $ ] valley subspace , the polarized state @xmath133 is spin - valley blocked ( see the discussion of spin - valley blockade below ) .",
    "since out of anticrossing it is equally coupled via @xmath134 to two degenerate states @xmath135 , fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b , this creates a coherent superposition of these states , in which the singlet part , @xmath136 , is canceled , while the triplet @xmath137 is spin - valley blocked .",
    "further hf coupling of @xmath138 to the unblocked singlet @xmath139 , is suppressed by the finite exchange splitting @xmath89 ( fig .",

    "the above arguments complete the explanation of suppression of the esr signal out of anticrossing , observed experimentally ( fig .",

    "[ fig:5]c we plotted the energy difference for each pair of states , with an intensity given by the absolute value of the ac coupling which qualitatively reconstructs the anticrossing picture observed experimentally . despite the many different transitions which give rise to multiple esr lines / crossings , the ac coupling filters out many of them ( still involving all three anticrossing spots , scf .",

    "the discovery of the anomalous anticrossing demonstrates the possibility to characterize and manipulate spin - valley states using esr , for individual qubits . in a long run , with a better understanding of the device physics of silicon quantum dots , one can choose , design , and operate qubits in regimes which are better suited for robust quantum computation ( examples could include making valley splitting large enough across devices or improving surface interfaces ) .",
    "our results improve the outlook of si mos qds as a platform for high - coherence spin qubits , in the now leading microelectronics material .",
    "the sample used in this experiment was fabricated on undoped commercial @xmath176 wafer with a @xmath177 thermal @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "first , the ohmic contacts were made by phosphorous ion - implantation followed by a high temperature annealing .",
    "then , the confinement gates as well as the co - planar strip ( cps ) loop were defined by electron beam lithography . before putting on the global accumulation gate ( cr / au ) , a @xmath179 @xmath180 , which serves as an insulating layer between confinement gates and accumulation gates ,",
    "was grown by atomic layer deposition .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a for the cross section layout of the dqd device .",
    "we use aluminum as the material for cps loop and obtain a few @xmath181 loop resistance to maximize the transmission of microwave signal .",
    "the device is mounted on the cold - finger of a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of @xmath182 .",
    "an in - plane magnetic field is created via a superconducting magnet ; possible trapping of a residual magnetic flux may cause an overall shift of the magnetic field read - off by a few mt .",
    "the electron temperature is about @xmath183 .",
    "a semirigid cable delivers the microwave , which is generated by hp / agilent signal generator 8673b , to the coplanar loop .",
