    "rising expenditures and constraints on health care budgets have prompted the development of a variety of methods for the analyses of hospital charge and length of stay ( los ) as discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . identifying the important determinants of charge and los",
    "is a critical step in optimizing the allocation of healthcare resources .",
    "however , it is always challenging to find regression models that can efficiently resolve the potential endogenous issues caused by the complicated causal relationship among charge , los and many other factors .",
    "in fact , total charge is naturally increasing as the increasing of los because more healthcare resources would be consumed during a longer stay . on the other hand , los",
    "might also be influenced by the accumulation of total charge over time because charge reflects the potential economic incentives to both of patient s and doctor s discharge decision .",
    "finally , factors , like patient s diagnosis , severity of illness , insurance status and so on , could affect the interaction between the charge accumulation and discharge decision ( or los ) .",
    "one efficient solution to endogenous issues is to model the charge , discharge decision ( or los ) and the interaction between them `` internally '' so that a parametric joint distribution of the charge and los can be derived explicitly from the model .",
    "all external factors come into affecting charge and los only through those parameters involved in the joint distribution .    following this direction , @xcite and @xcite estimated a model in which both of the charge and los were included endogenously .",
    "however , neither of them attempted to derive a general expression of the joint density of charge and los . instead , they relied on a few special classes of parametric density functions . as a consequence , @xcite and @xcite",
    "can not test the goodness of fitting of their model to the joint density of charge and los , meanwhile they have to face the technical challenge of how to select viable instrument variables .    in this paper , we shall extend the model introduced in @xcite and @xcite in the direction that we will derive an explicit expression of the joint probability density of charge and los . with the joint density function",
    ", we can use the full maximum likelihood method ( fml ) to estimate the parameters in contrast to introduce instrument variables as did in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of fml is that the resulting estimators are asymptotically unbiased , efficient ( endogeneity resolved ) and the asymptotic distribution of estimators is known to be normal .    in section 2 , we re -",
    "introduce the model discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and derive the marginal and joint distributions of charge and los associated with this model . since the model in consideration is a continuous - time random growth process with a markovian radom stopping time",
    ", we will call it rgmrst model in short . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out the regression analysis based on the rgmrst model and use fml to do estimation with respect to the charge and los data sampled from sparcs 2013 .",
    "consider the continuous - time version of the rgmrst model .",
    "a continuous time rgmrst process is defined as    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is decision variable representing patient s discharge decision , whether or not to stay in hospital for longer time at each time point @xmath2 , it takes value 1 if patients decide to stay and 0 otherwise .",
    "@xmath3 is a non - negative process characterizing the potential increment of charge per unit time provided that patient decides to stay .",
    "two natural constraints for the decision variable @xmath4 are as following :    \\1 .",
    "( continuity property ) @xmath4 is right continuous with respect to time @xmath2 ; and    \\2 .",
    "( non - increasing property )    @xmath5    the non - increasing property means once if a patient ( represented as state @xmath6 ) decides to leave hospital at time @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , he / she could never choose to come back at later time @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . based on the non - increasing property and continuity property , time in rgmrst process can be naturally interpreted as the length of a patient staying in hospital .",
    "consequently , the random time @xmath10 is exactly the length of stay associated with patient @xmath6 and the random variable @xmath11 represents the total charge at discharge day .",
    "one important advantage of the continuous time rgmrst process is that both of the marginal and joint distributions induced by @xmath11 , @xmath12 can be solved for explicitly . in the next section ,",
    "we focus on the explicit expression of these distributions .",
    "we need the following two important conditional expectations for the derivation of the distributions in interest :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is defined to be the potential growth process of charge .",
    "in addition , denote @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the probability density with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    under the following two properties that we require the functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the initial probability density function associated with @xmath22 ) to satisfy ,    [ property 1 ] @xmath19 , @xmath23 , and @xmath21 satisfy that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath21 is a well - defined probability density function .    [ property 3 ] the directional derivative for the function @xmath23 in the direction @xmath26 is non - positive for all @xmath27 .",
    "we could prove our main result , theorem [ existence and uniqueness ] .",
    "[ existence and uniqueness ] given functions @xmath19 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 and suppose all of them are @xmath28 functions .",
    "then there exists a rgmrst process @xmath29 satisfying equation [ unique eq ] if and only if @xmath19 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 satisfy property [ property 1 ] and [ property 3 ] .",
    "moreover , the process @xmath29 satisfying equation [ unique eq ] is unique in the sense that any two processes satisfying equation [ unique eq ] would induce the same time - dependent density function @xmath15 and the same joint distribution of charge and los .",
    "theorem [ existence and uniqueness ] follows from the following two lemmas :    [ lemma5 ] given a rgmrst process @xmath30 as in definition [ defn1 ] with the initial density @xmath21 .",
    "suppose the corresponding @xmath19 and @xmath23 functions as defined in equation [ unique eq ] satisfy the requirement in theorem [ existence and uniqueness ] , then the process @xmath31 is equivalent to the following rgmrst process defined on the probability space @xmath32\\times [ 0,\\infty),\\mathcal{b},dm\\times p\\left(.,0\\right)dm\\right)$ ]    @xmath33    in the sense that both rgmrst processes have the same time - dependent density function @xmath15 and the same joint distribution of charge and los .",
    "moreover , the @xmath19 and @xmath23 functions involved in above constructions satisfy    @xmath34    whenever @xmath23 is differentiable .",
    "where @xmath35 , viewed as a family of functions in variable @xmath2 , solves the initial value problems    @xmath36    and @xmath37 is defined as the inverse to @xmath38 such that @xmath39    [ lemma6 ] given a probability density function @xmath21 and functions @xmath40 such that property [ property 3 ] holds for @xmath19 and @xmath23 , then there exist rgmrst process @xmath41 which can be constructed in the same way as in equation [ q1_tilde construction ] and the process @xmath41 has the time - dependent charge density @xmath42    moreover , the joint distribution of final charge at discharge day @xmath43 and the los @xmath12 can be given as follows :    @xmath44    where the function @xmath38 is constructed from @xmath19 in the same way as in lemma [ lemma6 ] and @xmath45    proof for the two lemmas is in appendix a. based on the two lemmas , we can simply sketch the proof for theorem [ existence and uniqueness ] :    necessity of property [ property 1 ] and [ property 3 ] .",
    "property [ property 1 ] just says @xmath21 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are well - defined probability density and/or conditional expectations of some non - negative random variables .",
    "therefore , for an arbitrary rgmrst process @xmath48 , property [ property 1 ] always hold .",
    "lemma [ lemma5 ] implies property [ property 3 ] .",
    "sufficiency of property [ property 1 ] and [ property 3 ] is directly given by lemma [ lemma6 ] .",
    "lemma [ lemma5 ] give us a way to characterize a rgmrst process through specifying the conditional probability of @xmath49 on the deterministic version of the potential growth process .",
    "lemma [ lemma6 ] provides an explicit description ( eq .",
    "[ joint density 2nd expression ] ) of the joint distribution of final charge @xmath43 and the los @xmath12 .",
    "notice that equation [ joint density 2nd expression ] can be used to construct the likelihood function and fit real charge and los data .",
    "one big advantage of rgmrst process is its flexibility in the sense that all probability measure over @xmath50 absolutely continuous with respect to the standard lebesgue measure are in the closure of the set of all joint distributions of charge and los derived from some rgmrst process .",
    "in fact , we have the following    [ theorem flexibility ] fix @xmath19 with @xmath51 , then for every probability density function @xmath52 over @xmath50 , there always exist a @xmath23 function , an initial density function @xmath21 and a rgmrst process associated with the triple @xmath53 as constructed in lemma [ lemma5 ] such that the derived joint density of charge and los is given by @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , such a pair of @xmath54 is uniquely determined by the pair of @xmath55 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theorem flexibility ] is given in appendix [ proof for theorem flex ] .",
    "theorem [ theorem flexibility ] is powerful in the sense that using rgmrst process , not only an arbitrary joint density of charge and los can be approached , but the approaching can be realized only by choosing decision process @xmath23 and initial charge distribution @xmath21 properly while the potential increment process @xmath19 is fixed in prior .",
    "this result facilitates us to adopt the following view to interpret the treatment dynamics represented by rgmrst processes .",
    "a rgmrst process characterized as a triple @xmath53 is driven by three forces , the initial charge characterized by @xmath21 , the potential growing force characterized by @xmath19 and the stopping force characterized by the probability of deciding to stay @xmath23 . among them , the potential growing process are determined by the prevalent medical knowledge and techniques , routines and regulations that hospital system adopted .",
    "thus , the potential growing process should be `` stable '' in the sense that @xmath19 should have simple and fixed functional form which is invariant with respect to different patient groups ( e.g. different gender , age , drgs , location , wealthiness ) .",
    "in contrast , the initial charge and process of decision of staying are more likely to be affected by various covariates corresponding to individual patient and/or doctor ( e.g. patient s gender , age , race , drgs and doctor s gender , experience ) .",
    "consequently , the initial charge and decision process should be less `` stable '' in the sense that there should nt be any other restriction on the functional form for @xmath21 and @xmath23 than the two properties stated in section [ sec 2.2 ] to guarantee their well - definedness .",
    "our estimation is based on the full maximum likelihood method ( fml ) .",
    "therefore we need to define a likelihood function . to fully use the dynamic information provided by the underlying rgmrst process , we use the joint density function of charge and los to construct the likelihood function .",
    "formally , the logarithm of the likelihood function is given as below :      where @xmath57 denotes the joint density of charge and los .",
    "the equality holds by lemma [ lemma6 ] . from equality [ likelihood function ] , to specify the likelihood function , it suffices to choose a specific form for the triple @xmath53 . using the interpretation stated in the end of last section , the functional form of @xmath19 only reflects",
    "some fundamental properties of the entire medical system , which is stable in the long run and can be chosen with a simple form invariant with respect to different groups of inpatient . in the current setting",
    ", we choose              to avoid the subtlety of the requirement in property [ property 3 ] on the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath23 , we assume @xmath63 and @xmath64 are non - positive for all points in @xmath65 . under this restriction , property [ property 3 ] is always satisfied for arbitrary @xmath25 . in practice , we apply the following general form for @xmath23 .      where @xmath67 for each @xmath68 and satisfies @xmath69 ; @xmath70 is the standard normal distribution ; @xmath71 is the distribution function for some coxian phase type distribution which is of the following general form      where @xmath73 is a @xmath74 transition matrix characterizing the coxian phase type process with @xmath75 transient stages .",
    "@xmath76 is a @xmath75 dimensional vector with the first entry being @xmath77 and all other entries being 0 .",
    "@xmath78 is the @xmath75 dimensional vector with all entries being @xmath77 .",
    "a @xmath23 function as shown above is just a convex combination of the product of survival functions of phase type distribution and log - normal distribution .",
    "it is easy to check that such @xmath23 function is smooth , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 strictly negative and has range @xmath79 .",
    "[ theorem validation ] given a @xmath23 function of the form in [ q1_tilde form ] , @xmath19 of the form in [ q_tilde form ] and @xmath21 of the form in [ initial density ] , the joint density function of charge and los can be expressed as :      moreover , the marginal distribution for los is close to a coxian phase type distribution with difference controlled by @xmath81 ( constant @xmath82 depends on the phase type components @xmath83 s and log - normal components @xmath84 s ) ; the marginal density function of total charge has its right tail asymptotically equivalent to a log - normal density function as @xmath85 .",
    "theorem [ theorem validation ] implies that the form of @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 chosen as above can capture the major qualitative properties of inpatient data .",
    "therefore we could carry out parametric regression analysis on this basis .",
    "similarly to @xcite , @xcite , we choose a set of regressors to capture the heterogeneity of samples .",
    "regressors are involved in the likelihood function through the logarithm link function as used in @xcite .      where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are regressors chosen for charge and los respectively , @xmath89 s are the coefficients to be estimated .",
    "@xmath90 is a pair of random variable following the joint distribution given by equation [ joint density for estimation ] .",
    "notice that when regressors are involved in the above manner , parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 become redundant : we can set them to be constant at 1 .",
    "[ identification ] under the above link function , for each patient group identified by a fixed profile of covariates @xmath93 , the underlying rgmrst process of this patient group can be uniquely identified under the assumption that the functions @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 associated with the unique rgmrst process have the form given in equations [ initial density ] , [ q_tilde form ] and [ q1_tilde form ] respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be expressed as follows :          proposition [ identification ] gives us a way to recover the underlying rgmrst process from the estimated joint distribution of charge and los , therefore link the hidden patient s treatment dynamics together with the observable charge and los data .    combining the link function in equation [ link charge ] and [ link los ] , the joint density function given in [ joint density for estimation ] and the log - likelihood function in [ likelihood function ]",
    ", we obtain the log - likelihood function for the specific setting          where the four families of parameters to be solved are the weight vectors @xmath100 , the regression coefficients @xmath101 and parameter vectors for the log - normal components @xmath102 , and the parameter vectors for the phase type components @xmath103 where each @xmath104 is a @xmath105 dimensional vector which determines the transition matrix @xmath106 in the following way :              in this section , we apply the rgmrst process to fit real inpatient data and perform the regression analysis .",
    "we use inpatient data from new york state s statewide planning and research cooperative system 2013 ( sparcs 2013 ) .",
    "sparcs is a system initially created to collect information on discharges from hospitals within new york state .",
    "sparcs currently collects patient level detail on patient characteristics , diagnoses and treatments , services , and charges for each hospital inpatient stay and outpatient visit ; and each ambulatory surgery and outpatient services visit to a hospital extension clinic and diagnostic and treatment center licensed to provide ambulatory surgery services . in 2013 ,",
    "the sparcs contains nearly 2.5 million inpatient discharges from 218 facilities and 58 counties in new york state .",
    "patient demographics in the sparcs include age group at admission , gender , race , source of payment and zip code .",
    "patient clinical characteristics include type of admission , diagnosis codes ( mdc code , drg code , ccs diagnosis code etc . ) and treatment procedures undergone ( ccs procedure code ) . in this article ,",
    "our aim is at illustrating the methodology proposed in previous sections , so we intend to choose covariates as simple as possible .",
    "moreover , we are most interested in the effect of diagnosis - related covariates on charge and los , therefore the covariates we choose for estimation are mdc code , severity of illness code and risk of mortality .    intuitively , patients who have more severe illness condition and higher risk of mortality tend to stay in hospital for longer time and get charged more money .",
    "sparcs 2013 verified this intuition .",
    "patients with the most severe conditions ( apr severity of illness code = 4 ) have an extremely long mean los ( almost 17 days ) and the highest mean charge ( $ 210806 ) . similarly to the severity of illness , patients with highest risk to die has the longest mean los ( almost 15 days ) and highest mean charge ( $ 200746 ) .          due to the huge data size and limited computation power ,",
    "our estimation is based on a subset with size 5000 of sparcs 2013 obtained through uniform random sampling .",
    "descriptive statistics of the samples are summarized in tables [ table : 3.1 ] , ( sample _ is used to indicate the statistics computed for samples ) . through direct comparison of statistics computed for samples and for the entire database , we find that our samples copy the statistical properties of the entire database quite well .",
    "after preliminary goodness - of - fit analyses , the rgmrst model we finally choose for regression has only one summand appearing in the definition equation [ q1_tilde form ] of the @xmath23 function and the corresponding dimension of phase - type transition matrix is 1 as well .",
    "that means only three parameters are needed to characterize the underlying rgmrst process , two for the log - normal component ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) and one for the phase - type component ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "later , we will call this model rgmrst ( 1:1 ) with the first `` 1 '' representing the number of summand in equation [ q1_tilde form ] and the second `` 1 '' denoting the dimension of the corresponding phase - type component .",
    "the fitting result for both of the marginal and joint densities of charge and los are plotted in figure [ fig : marginal ] and [ fig : joint ] , where the estimated value of @xmath110 equals to @xmath111 .",
    "the fitting statistics and their p - values ( ks , chi - square ) are marked on the header of the corresponding plots .",
    "plot 1 is the joint density of log - charge and los derived from rgmrst ( 1:1 ) .",
    "plot 2 is the empirical joint density obtained from gaussian kernel density estimation ( kde ) with kernel width 0.15 for log - charge and 1 for los .",
    "plot 3 is obtained from subtracting plot 1 from plot 2 .",
    "plot 4 is the kde density versus the rgmrst ( 1:1 ) density evaluated at all 5000 samples .    in comparison",
    ", we also plot a log - normal fitting to the marginal charge distribution and a coxian phase - type fitting ( @xcite ) to the marginal los distribution in figure [ fig : marginal ] ( plot 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the phase - type distribution used here has a 4-dimensional transition matrix , which generates the besting fitting in out preliminary goodness - of - fit analyses according to the bic criteria .",
    "comparing the plot 4 and 6 in figure [ fig : marginal ] , it is easy to see that the marginal los fitting of a 4-phase coxian phase - type distribution ( with seven parameters used ) is not better than the fitting generated by a rgmrst process with only one phase - type and log - normal component ( with only three parameters used ) .",
    "moreover , only based on phase - type distribution , we can not generate fitting to charge , nor fitting to the joint of charge and los .",
    "therefore , we can conclude the rgmrst model could provide a more efficient method to fit the empirical charge and los data than its competitor , phase - type model .",
    "corresponding to rgmrst ( 1:1 ) , the estimated values of regression coefficients and the associated p - values are reported in table [ table : set1 reg coef sparcs ] .",
    "due to the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators , p - values in table [ table : set1 reg coef sparcs ] are computed from the corresponding fisher information ( @xcite ) of the log - likelihood function [ likelihood for estimation ] .",
    "finally , by [ a3 ] and [ a7 ] the the definition of joint probability density function , it can be easily verified that the joint density function of total charge and los can be expressed as claimed in equation [ joint density 2nd expression ] .",
    "the directional derivative of @xmath23 in the direction given by @xmath19 is always non - negative , which guarantees the process @xmath129 constructed in lemma [ lemma5 ] is a well defined rgmrst process .    for condition 1 and 2",
    ", we have to adopt similar trick as in the proof of lemma [ lemma6 ] .",
    "indeed , we need to compute @xmath130 and @xmath131 and show that the limit of their sum ( as @xmath132 ) has exactly the same form as expressed in equation [ time dependent density 2 ] .                  where @xmath143 is the conditional probability inuced by @xmath144 given @xmath145 and @xmath146 is the conditional probability induced by the increment @xmath147 given @xmath145 .",
