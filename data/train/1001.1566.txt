    "the mojave ( monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ) program @xcite has been monitoring a statistically complete , radio flux limited sample @xcite of 135 radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) for more than a decade .",
    "this monitoring program provides the parsec - scale morphology of agn jets evolving with time . after _",
    "s launch in june 2008 , we have the opportunity to investigate the relation between the parsec - scale radio - jet properties and the gamma - ray emission .",
    "first results of the correlation between gamma and radio properties have been presented in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray emission is thought to be generated close to the super massive black holes hosted in agn .",
    "moreover , with the simultaneous multiwavelength observations of agn , we are able to investigate the relation between parsec - scale jets and broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agn .",
    "to understand the high - energy behavior of the mojave sample , we are performing _ swift _ fill - in observations since 2007 on all the objects in the sample .",
    "our aim is to study the sed of the radio - selected agn sample from radio to gamma - ray , search for correlations , and to picture the physical mechanisms behind . in this paper , we selected six radio - bright agn which are faint or quiet in the preliminary lat first - year catalog , and which were not detected by egret . studying those sources could help us to understand the connection between radio and gamma - ray emissions , and the reason which makes those bright radio sources to be faint in gamma - rays . here",
    "we present and discuss the preliminary results obtained by the broadband study of the six sources .",

    "science tools version v9r10 and instrumental response functions ( irfs ) version ` p6_v3_diffuse ` . for the broadband",
    "sed , we included archival values from nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "here we present preliminary broadband sed of the six sources from radio to gamma - ray energies ( figure [ fig : sed2 ] to [ fig : sed4 ] ) .",
    "the lat spectral data presented here are obtained from the first 11-month dataset .",
    "we do not include the lat spectrum of 3c 309.1 because it is not included in the preliminary _ fermi _ lat year - one source list ( abdo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "there are two categories of sed models , with an interpretation of the high - energy part as being caused by compton upscattering by leptons @xcite or by hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "the lower energy part ( corresponding to the synchrotron radiation ) is originated by leptons . for gamma - faint sources , we are interested in investigating the relation between the synchrotron peak and the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) peak , and the extrapolation from the rising part before the ssc peak ( x - ray ) to the gamma - ray range . in this aspect ,",
    "sed fitting is needed , and will be included in a near future . here",
    "we discuss our preliminary sed results .",
    "most of the sources appear to have a comparable value of the synchrotron peak and the ssc peak .",
    "the spectra of nrao 140 , pks0403@xmath013 , pksb0422@xmath1004 , and pks0823 + 033 ( figure [ fig : sed2 ] to [ fig : sed6 ] ) are flat to inverted in flux density , and the latter two are steeper .",
    "the slopes of the radio spectra are milder for 3c309.1 and 3c380 ( figure [ fig : sed1 ] and [ fig : sed4 ] ) .",
    "if we extrapolate the sed from x - ray to gamma - rays , we see that the ssc peak seems lower than the synchrotron peak in pksb0422 + 004 and 3c309.1 ( figure [ fig : sed5 ] and [ fig : sed1 ] ) . for pks0823@xmath1033 , although the ssc peak appears slightly lower than the synchrotron peak by extrapolating from the x - ray spectrum , the gamma - ray flux increases at higher energies .",
    "this source is not in the tev catalog , and we need further analysis on the hardness of the gamma - ray spectrum in order to confirm this spectral rise in higher energies . for nrao140 ( figure [ fig : sed2 ] ) , pks0403@xmath013 ( figure [ fig : sed3 ] ) , and 3c380 ( figure [ fig : sed4 ] ) , the ssc peak is comparable with the synchrotron peak . for gamma - bright blazars ,",
    "the ssc peak in their sed tend to be a bit higher than the synchrotron peak ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to this , we see a trend that the ssc peak is comparable or lower than the synchrotron peak in the sed of these gamma - faint blazars , which are among the radio - brightest blazars in the sky",
    ". however , we need additional data to study the correlation between both peaks , as well as a detailed model of the physical process to reproduce the observed sed .",
    "we are compiling a broadband sed catalog for the 135 sources in the mojave sample .",
    "once collected , detailed analysis of the emission processes involved in the sed will be performed , and the deduced properties will be compared with the radio properties determined by the mojave and by single - dish observing programs . among the radio - bright sample ,",
    "the gamma - faint sources are especially interesting for that they provide us a chance to probe the link between radio and gamma - rays , and to find out the key which affects the emission process . for further investigation",
    ", the broadband sed modelling will be performed in the future , in order to understand the nature of blazars .",
