    "characterizations revealing the nature of pairing mechanism of the @xmath6k perovskite superconductor @xmath1 @xcite are at odds .",
    "the nuclear spin- lattice relaxation rate displays the typical behaviour of isotropic @xmath7-wave superconductivity with a coherence peak below the transition temperature @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , the specific heat @xcite and resistivity @xcite measurements imply a moderately coupled superconductor @xcite , which is well supported by the tunneling experiments @xcite as well as theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the penetration depth measurements however distinctly show a non @xmath7-wave bcs feature at low temperature @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian based model calculations , suggest @xmath1 to be a @xmath9- wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "a two band model also have been proposed @xcite to reconcile the controversies in the experiments .",
    "hall coefficient and thermoelectric power data @xcite show that the carriers are essentially electrons .",
    "however , it was also suggested that the holes in @xmath3 @xmath4 states could be responsible for the transport properties , in analogy with the holes in the @xmath10 @xmath11 states of perovskite oxide superconductors @xcite .",
    "the constant scattering approximation also shows that the thermoelectric power is hole - like above @xmath12k @xcite .",
    "in fact the multi- band model provides a consistent interpretation of the temperature dependence of the normal resistivity , hall constant and that of the thermoelectric power @xcite .",
    "the disparity in the experiments may arise due to the exactness in terms of stoichiometry .",
    "compositions namely @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 are reported @xcite , when subjected to different synthesizing routes ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the variation then suggests that the physical properties are intimately related to the temperature which can be thought to control the materials composition and/or configuration making it sensitive to the chemical nature of the compound as well as the specific method used for crystal growth . for example , two different phases- the @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been synthesized by changing the sintering temperature @xcite with @xmath17 phase being superconducting while the @xmath16 phase remain non - superconducting .",
    "the major difference between these two phases is in the exact @xmath0 content in the material . for high @xmath0 content ,",
    "the scanning experiments reveal the excess in terms of granules @xcite .",
    "the change from grain boundary to core pinning by these intra - granular nano - particles near the superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 suggests that the arrangement of pinning sites in @xmath1 is quite unique @xcite .",
    "however , the physical properties unveiled by the system is essentially a bulk property , not pertaining to any interfaces or micro - structures . nevertheless , the @xmath8 is sensitive to the @xmath0 content which decreases with decreasing @xmath18 , in @xmath19 and disappears for materials where @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the changes in the normal metal state properties of @xmath19 with respect to decreasing @xmath18 are what emphasized in the present work .",
    "the @xmath0 in the octahedral interstitial site of @xmath19 has two major roles to play .",
    "the spatially extended @xmath0 @xmath11 orbitals strongly hybridize with the @xmath3 @xmath4 , thus de - localizing the electronic states .",
    "delocalization leads to an overall reduction in its itinerant character , rendering a definite non - magnetic state .",
    "further , the presence of @xmath0 expands the unit cell dimensions which favors soft @xmath3- derived phonon modes @xcite .",
    "a recent @xmath0- isotope study @xcite and @xmath21 substitutions at @xmath0 sites @xcite show that in addition to the dominant @xmath3 modes @xcite , certain @xmath0 modes are also important in the materials pairing mechanism .    according to the microscopic theory of superconductivity , the occurrence of vacancies may influence @xmath22 either through a modification in the value of the density of states at fermi energy @xmath23 or through modifying the electron - phonon coupling parameter , or both .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling parameter is proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the transition metal and @xmath26 is the average squared moment of the phonon spectrum .",
    "one expects that vacancies in the @xmath0 sub - lattice of @xmath19 can have adverse effects on its lattice , electronic and other related properties .",
    "it is shown in a previous report that the @xmath23 decreases , rather abruptly , as an increasing function of vacancies @xcite .",
    "the decrease may be attributed to the disorder smearing of the electronic bands , in particular to those which constitute the van - hove singularity - like feature just below the fermi energy .",
    "however , it is possible that , if not at at the fermi energy , at least the upper valence band would get enriched in states due to breaking of the @xmath0-@xmath3 bonds .",
    "this may happen because some of the @xmath3 @xmath4 states , which were lowered in energy due to strong hybridization , would be transfered back to the higher energies in proportion to the exact concentration of vacancies in the @xmath0 sub - lattice .",
    "the redistribution can adversely affect the electronic structure related properties such as magnetism .",
    "earlier , it was conjectured that since the hypothetical @xmath27 shows a definite ferromagnetic ground state , the disappearance of superconductivity for @xmath20 alloys would be intimately related to the pair - breaking effects @xcite .",
    "this , however , is inconsistent with the experiments which detect no long - range magnetic ordering in @xmath19 alloys @xcite .",
    "first- principles density functional based calculations are carried out to study the changes in the equation of state parameters , viz the equilibrium lattice constant , bulk modulus and its pressure derivative as a function of @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "the changes in the electronic structure of the disordered @xmath19 as a function of @xmath18 are described by means of total and sub - lattice resolved partial density of states , calculated at their respective equilibrium lattice constants . on the other hand",
    "the propensity of magnetism in @xmath19 with respect to @xmath18 is studied by means of the fixed spin moment method .",
    "the fit of the magnetic energy with magnetization to the ginzburg- landau functional , and the variation of the ginzburg- landau coefficients as a function of @xmath18 suggests that @xmath0 deficiencies can enhance incipient magnetic properties .",
    "this is consistent with the self consistent calculations which find a significant charge redistribution owing to the transfer of certain @xmath3 @xmath4 states , from the intermediate energies to that close to the fermi energy .",
    "the ground state properties are calculated using the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method @xcite formulated in the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) ( ref.@xcite and references therein ) with chemical disorder accounted by means of coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite . for better refinements in the alloy energetics ,",
    "the asa is corrected by the use of both the muffin - tin correction for the madelung energy @xcite and the multi - pole moment correction to the madelung potential and energy @xcite .",
    "these corrections bring significant improvement in the accuracy by taking into consideration the non - spherical part of the polarization effects @xcite .",
    "the partial waves in the kkr - asa calculations are expanded up to @xmath28 inside the atomic spheres .",
    "the multi - pole moments of the electron density have been determined up to @xmath29 and then used for the multi - pole moment correction to the madelung energy .",
    "the exchange - correlation effects are taken into consideration via the local density approximation ( lda ) with perdew and wang parametrization @xcite .",
    "the core states have been recalculated after each iteration .",
    "the calculations are partially scalar relativistic in the sense that although the wave functions are non - relativistic , first order perturbation corrections to the energy eigenvalues due to the darwin and the mass - velocity terms are included .",
    "further , screening constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 were incorporated in the calculations , following the prescription of ruban and skriver @xcite .",

    "the atomic sphere radii of @xmath33 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 were kept as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 of the wigner - seitz radius , respectively .",
    "the vacancies in the @xmath0 sub - lattice are modeled with the help of empty spheres , and their radius is kept equal to that of @xmath0 itself .",
    "the overlap volume of the atomic spheres was less than @xmath37% , which is legitimate within the accuracy of the approximation @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath2-points for determining the total energies were kept in excess- @xmath38 @xmath2-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone . the convergence in charge density",
    "was achieved so that the root - mean square of moments of the occupied partial density of states becomes smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "numerical calculations of magnetic energy @xmath40 for @xmath19 are carried out at their self - consistently determined equilibrium lattice constants using the fixed spin moment method @xcite . in the fixed - spin moment method",
    "the total energy is obtained for given magnetization @xmath25 , i.e. , by fixing the numbers of electrons with up and down spins . in this case , the fermi energies in the up and down spin bands are not equal to each other because the equilibrium condition would not be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath25 . at the equilibrium @xmath25 two fermi energies will coincide with each other . the total magnetic energy becomes minimum or maximum at this value of @xmath25 .",
    "the estimation of the equilibrium lattice constant is a critical check to the various approximations involved in the method .",
    "the kkr - asa - cpa method estimates the lattice constant of @xmath1 to be @xmath41 @xmath42 , which is @xmath43% less than the experimental value @xcite .",
    "however , the value is consistent with an earlier full - potential based method @xcite .",
    "this shows that with the muffin - tin correction @xcite the energetics of the material is described more accurately , almost at par with the full - potential counterparts . in the neutral spheres approximation",

    ", one may use the third order birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite .",
    "the variation of these equation of state parameters as a function of @xmath18 are shown in fig.[mgcxni3-eos ] .",

    "the experiments find the rate of decrease as @xmath49 @xmath42/@xmath50%@xmath0 , while the present calculations find it to be @xmath51 @xmath42/@xmath50%@xmath0 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath47 could be attributed to the fact that upon creation of vacancies the material becomes some what hollow , making it vulnerable to high compressibility .",
    "the change in @xmath48 as a function of @xmath18 shows a minimum in the range of @xmath52 .",
    "the change in the slope of @xmath48 empirically suggests a change in the nature of chemical bonding as well as the lattice properties . in the debye approximation for isotropic materials , which assumes a uniform dependence of the lattice frequencies with volume",
    ", one may express the average phonon frequency in terms of @xmath48 proportional to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the average phonon frequency and @xmath55 is the equilibrium volume of the unit cell .",
    "note that @xmath55 decreases with decrease in @xmath18 , while @xmath48 decreases and then increases .",
    "such a behaviour indicates that the properties associated with the lattice could be different for @xmath56 and for @xmath57 alloys .      upon creation of vacancies in the @xmath0 sub - lattice , some of the @xmath0 @xmath11- @xmath3 @xmath4 bonds break and and it can be expected that the @xmath4 states may redistribute in the higher energy spectrum constituting the valence band . a possible way to examine",
    "this is to investigate the alloy density of states as a function of @xmath18 in @xmath19 , which is shown in fig.[mgcxni3-dos ] .",
    "the present kkr - asa - cpa calculations find @xmath23 for @xmath1 to be @xmath58 state / ry - atom ( or @xmath59 states / ev - cell ) .",
    "the present value is in reasonable agreement with the previously reported values .",
    "for example , szajek reports the value as @xmath60 states / ry - cell @xcite , mazin and singh report as @xmath61 states / ry - cell @xcite , shim @xmath62 @xmath63 as @xmath64 states / ry - cell @xcite , rosner @xmath62 @xmath63 as @xmath65 states / ry - cell @xcite .",
    "dugdale and jarlborg @xcite report @xmath23 to be @xmath66 and @xmath67 states / ev - cell for two different band - structure methods with exchange - correlation effects considered in the lda and using the experimental lattice constant .",
    "these results show that @xmath23 is indeed sensitive to the type of the electronic structure method employed and also to the numerical values of the parameters like that of the wigner - seitz radii and others .",
    "note that these differences are significant as they control the proximity to magnetism in the stoner model , as emphasized by singh and mazin @xcite .    as an decreasing function of @xmath18 , a rigid band description to account for the movement of @xmath68 fails for @xmath19 .",
    "the peak characteristic of the @xmath3 @xmath4 bands which lie just below the fermi energy , however , shows an insensitive change in its position on the energy scale .",
    "similar feature has also been reported by rosner @xmath62 @xmath63 @xcite for alkali metal substitutions at the @xmath33 site in @xmath1 . however , in @xmath19 , due to disorder broadening of the bands , the @xmath23 is found to decreases .",
    "the change in the total and sub - lattice resolved partial density of states at the fermi energy is shown in fig.[mgcxni3-nef ] .",
    "the initial change in @xmath23 as @xmath18 decreases from @xmath69 to @xmath70 is gradual , however displays a rapid change when @xmath0 is reduced further .",
    "such a decrease in @xmath23 do not correspond to a rigid band picture .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 @xmath11 contribution to @xmath68 decreases monotonically at the rate of @xmath71 states / ry - atom per @xmath50% of @xmath0 . while @xmath3 @xmath4 contribution remains more or less unaffected for the range of alloys in @xmath72 .",
    "an earlier calculation based on cpa in the lmto formalism finds a drastic linear decrease in @xmath23 as a decreasing function of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the authors report @xmath23 to be @xmath73 states / ev - cell ( @xmath74@xmath75 states / ry - atom ) at @xmath18= @xmath76 which decreases quietly linearly to @xmath77 states / ev - cell ( @xmath74@xmath78 states / ry - atom ) at @xmath18= @xmath79 .",
    "the present calculations , however , observe a slightly different trend in the change of @xmath23 with decreasing @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath23 at @xmath18=@xmath80 is calculated as @xmath81 states / ry - atom and that at @xmath18=@xmath79 to be as @xmath82 states / ry - atom .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to the assumption of a particular lattice constant ( experimental value ) in the previous tb - lmto - cpa calculations @xcite .    as a prelude to understanding the overall shift in the bands as a function of @xmath18 in @xmath19",
    ", one may look at the shift in the potential parameters , in particular the bottom of the band @xmath83 and the center of the band @xmath84 .",
    "the center of the @xmath3 @xmath4 band , @xmath85 shifts approximately by @xmath86 mry from @xmath87 to @xmath70 in @xmath19 .",
    "note that here @xmath88 represents the movement of the corresponding potential parameter towards ( away ) the fermi energy .",
    "this is a clear revelation of the fact that the upper valence band becomes enriched with states , as @xmath18 is decreased in @xmath19 .",
    "note that due to hybridization with the @xmath0 @xmath11 states , some of the @xmath3 @xmath4 states in @xmath1 are lowered in energy . upon creation of vacancies , a few of the @xmath89 bonds break , and result in charge redistribution .",
    "we also observe that the @xmath90 shifts away from the fermi energy by @xmath91 ry from @xmath87 to @xmath70 .",
    "in fact the @xmath92 octahedra is a covalently built complex to which the strong electro - positive @xmath33 is thought to have donated its outermost valence electrons .",
    "the crystal geometry suggests six @xmath3 atoms as the first nearest neighbors to @xmath0 with a bond length of @xmath93 @xmath42 , and eight @xmath33 atoms as its second nearest neighbors with a bond distance of @xmath94 @xmath42 in the unit cell .",
    "the @xmath33-@xmath3 bond length is @xmath95 @xmath42 , and as such for @xmath33 s the first coordination shell comprises of twelve @xmath3 atoms . for @xmath3 s",
    "the second nearest coordination shell carries four @xmath33 atoms .",
    "hence , the charge redistribution arising due to the breaking of the @xmath96-@xmath9 bonds are consistent with the fact that a larger fraction of the charge is transfered back to the @xmath33 sub - lattice , in comparison with that of the @xmath3 sub - lattice .    the shift in the @xmath85 towards the fermi energy indicates an accumulation of @xmath3 @xmath9 states in the upper valence band which then opens up two possibilities for the disappearance of superconductivity- ( i ) the transfer of the states from low energy to higher energy states , would increase the itinerant nature of electrons , thus enhancing the possibility of spin - fluctuations , and ( ii ) if the @xmath3 @xmath4 holes are responsible for superconducting pairing mechanism , then these states would be annihilated .",
    "to proceed further , one may require to decompose the density of the states along various high symmetry points and / ore directions of the cubic brillouin zone .",
    "a convenient quantity to describe the @xmath2-resolved density of states of substitutionally disordered systems is the bloch spectral function @xmath97 , which is the number of states per energy ( @xmath98 ) and wavelength . in the case of pure metals",
    "the function is simply a sum of delta functions either as function of @xmath98 at a constant wave vector @xmath2 , or as a function of the wave - vector @xmath2 for constant value of the energy . for constant @xmath99 , where @xmath68 is the fermi energy the positions of the peaks in @xmath2-space",
    "define the fermi surface of the metal ( see refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath2-space representation is a good description of the electronic structure of the alloy although strictly speaking there is periodicity only on the average . in alloys ,",
    "the bloch spectral functions have their peaks lowered and broadened due to disorder .",
    "thus , a fermi surface for the alloy is still defined through the positions of the peaks but these peaks have a finite width .",
    "the states at the @xmath5 point of the brillouin zone are shown in fig.[cx - bsf - g ] .",
    "the states corresponding to @xmath100 ry are primarily composed of @xmath33 @xmath101 states .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath11-@xmath3 @xmath4 hybrids form a complex in the energy range -@xmath102 , where @xmath68 is taken as zero of the energy scale . as a function of vacancy concentration , it is clear from fig.[cx - bsf - g ] that a rigid - band picture is violated .",
    "states are redistributed at this high symmetry point , with a few of the @xmath3 @xmath4 states lifted to higher energies , particularly in the range @xmath103 .",
    "the peak corresponding to @xmath104 ry has in it a component of @xmath33 @xmath101 - @xmath3 @xmath4 hybrid , which as a function of @xmath18 lowers in energy .",
    "the sharp structure just below the fermi energy is characteristic of @xmath3 @xmath4 , which is less sensitive to the vacancy concentration .",
    "what follows from fig.[cx - bsf - g ] is that the effects of vacancies are restricted to the energy range @xmath105 , with a significant redistribution of states , leading to an enhanced @xmath3 @xmath4 character at @xmath68 .",
    "there is a slight increase in the density of states at @xmath68 , which is far from any rigid - band interpretation .",
    "a flat band running close to the @xmath25 point of the brillouin zone has been mapped as a singularity in the dos of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it has been emphasized that this singularity could induce magnetic instability upon @xmath106 holes when introduced @xcite .",
    "fig.[cx - bsf - m ] shows the changes in the bloch spectral function for @xmath19 alloys at the @xmath25 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "the states near the fermi energy are primarily @xmath3 @xmath4 in character and do not show any significant change with increase in vacancies .",
    "the major effect of disorder is contained in two energy region , concentrated at @xmath104 and @xmath107 ry , respectively .",
    "these states result from a strong hybridization effect of @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath0 @xmath11 bands . upon the creation of vacancies",
    ", the states concentrated around @xmath104 ry are raised in energy .",
    "the peak at @xmath108 ry lowers in height , and the states are transfered to @xmath107 ry .",
    "the fermi energy is almost pinned at the foot of the sharp singularity , thus maintaining the overall characteristic property of the alloy as a function of @xmath18 in @xmath19 alloys .",
    "the peak that evolves towards the bottom of the valence band is that of the @xmath33 @xmath101 band , which moves slightly towards lower energy .",
    "we note that in asa formalism , the height of the spectral peak at a particular energy do not exactly refer to the states it holds , since the relevant matrix elements are ignored .",
    "however , a comparison may still be useful , since the approximations involved in the calculations are the same .",
    "figure [ cx - bsf - r ] shows the redistribution of the states at the @xmath109 point of the brillouin zone in @xmath19 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "the states residing deep in energy are due to the @xmath33 @xmath101 states , which move down as a function of increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the major effects take place where @xmath0 @xmath11 bands are positioned , i.e. , at around @xmath110 ry and @xmath111 ry .",
    "the states in the energy range @xmath112 are strictly @xmath3 @xmath4 in character which is least affected .",
    "the importance of the @xmath113 point lies in the hole states it accommodates , which is characterized by a peak just above the fermi energy . as charge redistributes , with the upper valence band becoming more @xmath3 @xmath4 in character",
    "the hole states are however not annihilated . instead , the height of the peak decreases , showing a greater dispersion of the bands",
    "however , as for other high symmetry points , one can see the distortion in those specific regions where @xmath0 @xmath11 states dominate .    in all cases",
    ", one finds that vacancies do not mimic a rigid band scenario .",
    "some of the low lying @xmath3 @xmath4 states , due to hybridization with @xmath0 @xmath11 states , are restored back to the higher energies when the bonds break . charge transfer to the @xmath33 sub - lattice",
    "is seen to occur via movement of the @xmath33 @xmath101 peaks to lower energies as well as an increase in the height of the peaks .",
    "as the charge redistributes , the nature of the bonding could be adversely affected .",
    "the covalent character of @xmath19 then may decrease as an decreasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "incipient magnetism , due to delocalization of the @xmath3 @xmath4 states owing to the strong hybridization with the @xmath0 @xmath11 are probable in @xmath1 . following the stoner criteria",
    ", it has been anticipated that spin fluctuations may co - exist with superconductivity in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this however had been later confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "self consistent calculations , down to @xmath114 in @xmath19 , do not find any magnetic solution .",
    "both spin polarized and spin unpolarized shows degeneracy in their total energies . to understand the change in the incipient magnetic properties , as a function of @xmath18 in @xmath19 alloys , one",
    "may then adopt the fixed - spin - moment method @xcite by which the the energy difference between a magnetic state with magnetic moment @xmath25 and the paramagnetic state , @xmath40 ( = @xmath115 ) , for given values of @xmath25 can be calculated .",
    "the calculated @xmath40 is then fitted to the ginzburg- landau equation of form @xmath116 .",
    "the calculated results of @xmath40 are shown in fig.[cx - fsmdeltaem ] .",
    "the numbers shown in the figure denote the @xmath0 concentration .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the curve of @xmath40 is rather flat near @xmath117 and the flatness increases as @xmath18 decreases .",
    "the curve is fit to the form of a power series of @xmath118 up to the term for @xmath119 , for the polynomial as mentioned above .",
    "the variation of the coefficients , @xmath120 in units of @xmath121 , @xmath122 in @xmath123 , and @xmath124 in @xmath125 as a function of @xmath18 , calculated at the respective equilibrium lattice constants are shown in fig.[cx - coeffgl ] .",
    "the propensity of magnetism can be inferred from the sign of the coefficient which is quadratic in @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath120 is the measure of the curvature and is positive definite when the total energy minimum is at @xmath117 .",
    "this refers to the paramagnetic case .",
    "when @xmath120 becomes negative , it infers that there exists a minimum in the @xmath126 curve other than @xmath117 which then points to a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the higher order coefficients @xmath122 and @xmath124 are also significant and control the variation .",
    "in fact , @xmath122 determines whether for a system there exists a metastable state or not .",
    "consider a case where @xmath120 is small and positive while @xmath122 is relatively large and negative .",
    "in such a case , the calculations extended to large values of @xmath25 would tend to show a metastable state away from the total energy minimum .",
    "often , calculations for large values of @xmath25 , implying large applied external fields , can lead to ambiguous results .",
    "hence , it is more accurate to carry out calculations for smaller values of @xmath25 and use the above mentioned polynomial function up to the minimum order , where the curve fits with sufficient accuracy .",
    "[ cx - coeffgl ] shows that for @xmath127 , from the @xmath0 rich side , the alloys tend to enhance their latent magnetic properties .",
    "one may also note that @xmath122 tends to become large and negative .",
    "this however is complimented by an opposite variation in the coefficient @xmath124 .",
    "hence , in the renormalized approach to include corrections due to spin - fluctuations as like given in ref.(@xcite ) , they would tend to cancel out , in proportion , preserving the trend in the variation of @xmath120 .",
    "thus , it becomes more or less conclusive within the approach that the incipient magnetic properties associated with @xmath0 non - stoichiometry in @xmath19 would increase as a function of vacancies in the @xmath0 sub - lattice . if one considers the proximity of @xmath128 as an indication of spin - fluctuations , then the calculations within the approximation clearly show that effects of spin - fluctuations would be dominant in deciding the incipient magnetic properties of @xmath19 as a function of decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the movement of the center of the @xmath3 @xmath4 bands towards fermi energy , as well as a very little change in the @xmath23 as a function of decreasing @xmath18 , determined in the self - consistent calculations .",
    "since magnetism is controlled by @xmath23 , one may calculate the average density of states over the two spin bands in the fixed - spin moment method .",
    "the variation of this quantity as a function of @xmath25 , for @xmath18 in @xmath19 alloys is shown in fig.[cx - avdos ] .",
    "note that lattice relaxation could be important @xcite and particularly when @xmath18 increases in @xmath19 .",
    "however , the results that are discussed are strictly for a case where one may find a rigid underlying lattice , and also that the vacancies spread in the alloy is random .",
    "thus , in general , it follows that as @xmath18 decreases in @xmath19 , the propensity of magnetism increases .",
    "however , since @xmath23 decreases , the stoner criteria is less fulfilled , making the material paramagnetic definite according to the itinerant models of magnetism .",
    "the change in the equation of state parameters , density of states and magnetic properties of @xmath19 are studied by means of the kkr - asa - cpa method .",
    "both lattice constant and bulk modulus decrease with decreasing @xmath18 , while the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus , which is proportional to the average phonon frequency of the material in the debye approximation , is found to show an anomaly at about @xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath23 decreases , however not as expected by a rigid band model .",
    "the bloch spectral density evaluated at the @xmath5 point shows creation of new states below @xmath68 while for other high symmetry points they are shifted on the energy scale .",
    "the change in the coefficient @xmath120 in the ginzburg - landau equation for magnetic phase transition towards lower values suggests that incipient magnetic properties may be enhanced as a decreasing function of @xmath18 in @xmath19 alloys .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that due to bond breaking , some of the low lying @xmath3 @xmath4 states are transfered to higher energies , increasing the itinerancy of the material .",
