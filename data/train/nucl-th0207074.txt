    "experiments with nuclear collisions at ultrarelativistic energies are performed with the aim of studying strongly interacting matter under high temperature and density .",
    "such conditions are created very early in the collision .",
    "hadrons at low transverse momentum form the bulk of the particles produced in these collisions .",
    "they are produced at the end of the hot and dense partonic phase , but they subsequently scatter in the confined hadronic phase prior to decoupling from the collision system ( `` freeze - out '' ) . in general , the collective evolution of the hot and dense matter leaves a distinct imprint on the phase space distribution of the fireball at freeze - out .",
    "for example , pressure gradients generated in the early stage of the collision and indicative of the equation of state result in collective transverse , radial and elliptic flow which shape important features of hadronic one- and two - particle spectra .",
    "however , to disentangle such information from features generated during freeze - out a refined understanding of the decoupling process is needed .",
    "this is the condition which has to be satisfied locally for decoupling to take place .",
    "freeze - out is often modeled as a sudden breakup of the fireball on a fixed three - dimensional hypersurface @xcite , specified e.g. by a critical freeze - out temperature or density .",
    "this implements in a very simplified way the physical picture that the hadronic scattering rate drops with particle phase space density and determines freeze - out .",
    "however , the current difficulties in interpreting the hbt spectra measured at rhic @xcite motivate to go beyond a sharp three - dimensional implementation of freeze - out .",
    "moreover , the recently observed increase in average pion phase space density from sps ( @xmath2 ) to rhic ( @xmath3 )  @xcite indicates that  in contrast to an earlier suggestion  @xcite  additional factors beyond the particle phase space density must be taken into account .",
    "this prompts us in the present work to discuss quantitatively how hadrochemical composition  @xcite , local temperature and collective velocity gradients  @xcite , and particle momentum influence the decoupling of particles from the collision region .",
    "since hadrochemistry does , and freeze - out temperature or velocity gradients may change in going from sps to rhic energies , this study also addresses the possible dependence of hadronic freeze - out on bombarding energy .    clearly ,",
    "in the general case , particles decouple from the fireball gradually @xcite , as it is naturally implemented e.g. in cascade generator simulations .",
    "the question arises to what extent this generic behavior can be described by the limiting case of a sharp three - dimensional freeze - out . to discuss this question ,",
    "we first introduce in section [ sec2 ] the so - called escape probability which characterizes the probability of a particle to decouple from the system . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we demonstrate on simple examples how the escape probability is related to the expansion strength and the scattering rate .",
    "this illustrates the old suggestion @xcite , that freeze - out happens when the dilution rate becomes comparable or larger than the scattering rate .",
    "moreover , the scattering rate depends on densities of individual species and the corresponding cross - sections @xcite . for pions , e.g. , scattering on nucleons",
    "is much more important than scattering on other pions due to the larger cross - section of the former . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we discuss the impact of the hadrochemical composition on the scattering rates and freeze - out at sps and rhic .",
    "this also allows to address the observed change in freeze - out phase space density  @xcite .",
    "finally , we turn to the dependence of the scattering rate and escape probability on temperature . in doing so , we find that @xmath4 of the particles are emitted at temperatures below @xmath5 mev .",
    "we discuss this result , together with other findings of our calculations in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the following discussion of the freeze - out process @xcite is based on the particle escape probability @xmath6 defined as @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the distribution function of a given particle species and @xmath9 denotes the distribution of that fraction of particles which have decoupled from the system prior to time @xmath10 and will not rescatter in the future . for a particle with momentum @xmath11 at space - time point @xmath12 ,",
    "the probability to escape the medium without future interaction is @xcite @xmath13 here , the scattering rate @xmath14 denotes the inverse of the mean time between collisions for a particle at position @xmath15 with momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the _ opacity integral _ in determines the average number of collisions of the particle after time @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for a particle which tries to escape the medium at time @xmath10 with velocity @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ e : escprob ] ) determines the probability that the particle succeeds to do so .",
    "the limiting case of a sharp freeze - out along the three - dimensional proper time hypersurface given by @xmath17 @xcite can be characterized by an abrupt change of the particle escape probability ( [ e : escprob ] ) from zero to one @xmath18 freeze - out along more general three - dimensional hypersurfaces @xcite can be defined by requiring this kind of threshold behavior of the escape probability along those hypersurfaces .",
    "it corresponds to a scattering rate which changes abruptly from a large value to zero along the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "hypersurfaces of the type are characterized by a criterion which tests _ only the medium _ , but does not depend on the particle momentum and particle properties . in the general case of continuous freeze - out , the situation is different since freeze - out does depend on particle momentum and properties . to characterize the four - volume from which particles decouple ,",
    "one requires @xcite @xmath19 this specifies the region in which the amount of escaped particles of momentum @xmath20 is growing .",
    "note that this general condition also characterizes the freeze - out hypersurface in case of the sharp freeze - out according to eq .  .",
    "condition ( [ e : ufc ] ) assumes , however , that there is no additional particle production , i.e. , @xmath21 . in the presence of such particle production ,",
    "one generalizes to @xmath22 .",
    "in general , the evaluation of the criterion is complicated . in the discussion",
    ", we shall consider a related , much simpler condition which gives some access to the structure of a four - dimensional freeze - out region on the basis of the escape probability .",
    "it has been argued a long time ago @xcite that freeze - out happens when the dilution rate becomes larger than the collision rate . here",
    ", we demonstrate how the collision rate and the expansion strength determine the escape probability .    to this end , we consider the simplified case of a particle of vanishing transverse momentum in the center of the fireball .",
    "such a particle does not propagate through layers of different density but  due to expansion  finds itself in a medium of decreasing density .",
    "this simplification allows to illustrate the effect of dynamical properties of the collision region on freeze - out without being sensitive to further complications of the general case such as finite - size effects which depend on the production point and velocity of the test particle .",
    "we start the discussion of the escape probability by considering a simple power - law ansatz for the scattering rate @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the scattering rate at the time @xmath25 .",
    "below , we detail soon the assumptions on which ( [ rtau ] ) is based and how the exponent @xmath26 characterizes the expansion strength of the system . to set the stage , however , we consider first the opacity integral of ( [ rtau ] ) , @xmath27 this illustrates the typical interplay of scattering and expansion : a given escape probability can be obtained for different values of the scattering rate , with a higher scattering rate @xmath24 compensated by a stronger expansion ( larger @xmath26 ) .",
    "we further illustrate this point with two analytically accessible models for the fireball expansion .",
    "both are based on a factorized ansatz for the scattering rate in terms of the ( averaged ) cross - section @xmath28 for scattering in the medium , and the average velocity @xmath29 relative to other particles , @xmath30 while the time dependence of @xmath31 does not factorize in the general case , one may hope to capture the dominant features of a realistic dynamical evolution by retaining the time dependence of the density , only .    for the first model , we choose a power - law fall - off of the density @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the density at the time @xmath25 . from this",
    ", the expression can be recovered .",
    "this time - dependence of the density may not be realised during the whole evolution of the fireball ; we assume it just in the final stage of the collision .",
    "therefore , the time @xmath10 is now _ defined _ by the dilution rate @xmath34 @xmath35 even though we are interested in the situation along the longitudinal symmetry axis of the fireball , the time @xmath10 agrees with the `` usual '' longitudinal proper time @xmath36 only if the density evolves according to from the very beginning of the collision ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "otherwise it corresponds to a different starting point @xmath38 of the time scale _ and _ @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 has to be a free parameter , and is not necessarily equal to the longitudinal proper time measured from the moment of the first approach of the colliding nuclei . ]",
    "@xmath39 this is analogous to the hubble time in cosmology which is defined as the inverse of the expansion velocity gradient .",
    "we insert this dynamical information in the usual parametrization of the expansion four - velocity @xmath40 in accord with relation , the space - time rapidity is defined as @xmath41 \\ , ,    \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath42 are the standard radial coordinates used in the plane transverse to the beam .",
    "the transverse rapidity @xmath43 will be assumed to grow _ linearly _ with the radial coordinate . if the particle number is conserved , which is a good assumption at the end of the hadronic phase , the dilution rate is related to the divergence of the velocity field @xcite @xmath44 if we assume that @xmath45 , then eq .   links the four - velocity field with the ansatz .",
    "this specifies the time dependence of the transverse rapidity    [ casea ] @xmath46    in the vicinity of @xmath47 , the choice @xmath48 leads to quasi - inertial flow which corresponds to an asymptotic solution of the fireball hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath49 and @xmath50 stand for radially decelerating and accelerating flow profiles , respectively .",
    "this illustrates the phenomenological consequences of a specific choice of the exponent @xmath26 .",

    "it is to a good approximation equal to the transverse velocity gradient .",
    "this substantiates the statement made above : a higher scattering rate can be compensated by a stronger transverse flow and still lead to the same escape probability .",
    "we note that it is not the average flow velocity , but the local flow _ gradient _ which determines the local density decrease and thus enters . in appendix [ a1 ] we relate this result to the freeze - out criterion requiring the scattering rate to be smaller than the dilution rate @xcite .    for a second simple dynamical model of the fireball evolution",
    ", we turn to recent hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "these indicate that the transverse expansion at the freeze - out stage may be better described by the ansatz    [ caseb ] @xmath53    rather than by the expressions and used above . in this case",
    ", the variable @xmath10 is still given by the relation , but corresponds now to the inverse longitudinal gradient of the expansion velocity @xmath54 the ansatz implies a different time - dependence of the density . from eq .",
    ", one finds for the density at the center of the fireball @xmath55 where @xmath33 is again the density at the time @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding opacity integral reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the incomplete @xmath58-function @xcite @xmath59 relation is less transparent than but it shows the same qualitative feature : stronger scattering can be compensated by transverse expansion and lead to the same escape probability .",
    "in the previous section , we studied the effect of expansion on freeze - out .",
    "we derived expressions for the opacity integral which depend on the scattering rate at a fixed time @xmath25 .",
    "here we calculate this scattering rate and we study how it depends on hadrochemistry and temperature . in particular , we determine the scattering rate corresponding to the hadronic final states at sps and rhic .",
    "the scattering rate for a test pion of momentum @xmath11 due to interactions with particles of type @xmath60 and momentum @xmath61 can be written as @xcite @xmath62 here , @xmath63 denotes the total cross - section for collinear collision , @xmath64 and the cms energy @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that the distribution of scattering partners @xmath66 is given by the equilibrium form . in this way we neglect the modification of the distribution function due to decoupling of some particles .",

    "this is known to provide a good description of the hadronic final state at sps and rhic @xcite .",
    "the total scattering rate is obtained by integrating the expression ( [ e : pirest ] ) over momentum @xmath61 and summing over all species @xmath60 @xmath72    all pion scattering rates are computed in the rest frame of the hadron gas .",
    "we include pions , ( anti)nucleons , kaons , rhos , and ( anti)deltas as scattering partners .",
    "the total cross section of pion - baryon scatterings is parameterized as @xcite @xmath73 this is the usual breit  wigner resonance formula where @xmath74 is the resonance mass and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the total and the partial width for the given decay channel , respectively .",

    "the square of clebsch  gordan coefficient @xmath78 assures that the appropriate fraction of the resonance state is picked in coupling of the isospin states of the two scattering partners .",
    "particle properties are taken from @xcite except for higher excitations with large uncertainties which are taken from @xcite .",
    "for scattering on both strange and non - strange mesons , the formula is used again and a 5  mb momentum - independent contribution is added to account for elastic processes . the cross - section with baryons",
    "is taken to saturate at 30  mb for @xmath79 above 3  gev/@xmath80 .",
    "this , however , has a negligible effect on the calculation since high momentum particles are suppressed in the thermal distribution .    to fix the hadrochemical composition of scattering partners at sps and rhic , an estimate of the chemical potentials entering ( [ e : therm ] )",
    "is needed .",

    ".chemical potentials in units of mev used in the calculation for sps at @xmath2.[t : spsmus ] [ cols=\"^,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the same procedure is repeated for rhic at @xmath95 .",
    "results are summarized in table  [ t : rhicmus ] .",
    "the yields at mid - rapidity for pions , ( anti)protons , and kaons were taken from @xcite .",
    "unlike at sps , the feed - down to ( anti)proton yields from weak decays was not corrected for in the used data .",
    "we performed a simple correction by assuming that the yields of @xmath96 s and @xmath97 s are given by the same temperature and their chemical potentials equal to that of the protons .",
    "the preliminary data on pion phase - space density presented recently by star show small statistical error bars only @xcite , and lie close to the upper bound of the large systematic errors quoted earlier @xcite .",
    "our analysis accounts for this not fully clarified experimental situation by associating to the central value of the most recent data @xcite the large ( asymmetric ) systematic errors of @xcite . to avoid a bias in relating sps and rhic energies",
    ", we compare the upper bound of the chemical potential for rhic in table [ t : rhicmus ] ( which corresponds to the central value in @xcite ) to the upper bound listed in table  [ t : spsmus ] for sps .",
    "we thus underestimate the difference between rhic and sps .",
    "figure  [ f : contribs ] shows the corresponding scattering rates for @xmath98 100  mev .",
    "the smaller contribution of nucleons at rhic is largely compensated by antinucleons . despite the increased pion phase - space density at rhic , the pionic contribution does not dominate the total scattering rate because of the small pion - pion cross section .",
    "scattering on pions is of comparable importance to scattering on nucleons and antinucleons : both particle species lead to a momentum averaged scattering rate of @xmath99 .",
    "we observe that the increase of pion phase - space density at rhic when compared to sps @xcite has no significant impact on the scattering rate .",
    "the earlier suggestion that the pion phase - space density at the freeze - out should be a universal quantity @xcite did not account for the contribution of other particle species to the pion scattering rate .",
    "figure  [ f : comp ] summarizes our results for the various sets of freeze - out temperature and chemical potentials which limit the range of values consistent with data from sps and rhic . although particle densities are approximately the same for all temperatures , the scattering rate increases significantly with temperature .",
    "on the other hand we see a generic decrease of the scattering rate with the pion momentum .",
    "this behavior is mainly dictated by phase - space available for the collisions , but also depends on the cross - section as a function of @xmath100 .",
    "we discuss this behavior in more detail in appendix [ a2 ] .    in the lowest panel of fig  [ f : comp ]",
    "we compare the extreme results for sps and rhic .",
    "if the scattering rate in one of the systems was clearly larger than in the other one , this would indicate a stronger transverse expansion in that system , as follows from section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we see that the present data do not allow to make any conclusion on this subject just by using the scattering rate .",
    "in this paper , we have have calculated the scattering rates of pions which are characteristic for the late hadronic phase of the collisions at sps and rhic .",
    "we also illustrated for simple examples how these scattering rates determine the escape probability , and how the escape probability is affected by velocity gradients .",
    "moreover , we found that the temperature dependence of the scattering rate allows to constrain the range of temperatures at which pion emission is significant . to estimate this temperature range , we combined the scattering rates of section [ sec4 ] with the expressions for the opacity integral and . here",
    ", we discuss what is needed to overcome the limitation of our approach and what our results imply for freeze - out in the realistic case .    to go beyond the calculations presented here will require a refined dynamical model which follows the full space - time evolution of the fireball .",
    "most likely , this will involve numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , one may hope to extend in this way the expressions for the opacity integral in section [ sec3 ] to the case of particles with finite momentum . for a realistic scenario ,",
    "we envisage the following additional effects :    1 .",
    "[ i1 ] in a transversely expanding fireball , particles with @xmath101 are produced from parts of the system that co - move transversely .",
    "their momentum relative to the medium @xmath102 is thus smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "the corresponding scattering rate @xmath104 is thus higher than the naively expected value at @xmath103 .",
    "hence , this effect _ lowers _ the escape probability .",
    "[ i2 ] a particle with finite @xmath103 can escape the fireball region in a finite time .",
    "thus , the corresponding opacity integral   receives a contribution from a finite time only , in contrast to the infinite time which is accumulated by a test particle with @xmath105 in our simplified calculation .",
    "this effect leads to a lower value of the opacity integral and _ enhances _ the escape probability .    also , the evaluation of the general freeze - out criterion is complicated and requires a complete knowledge of the space - time evolution of the fireball . to gain some understanding of the freeze - out process from the models studied here , however , it is instructive to turn to a simpler condition .",
    "let us define freeze - out for particles at position @xmath15 with momentum @xmath11 to occur if the corresponding escape probability @xmath106 increases above a certain threshold value .",
    "doing this , we actually specify a three - dimensional hypersurface on which a given fraction @xmath107 of all particles is already decoupled .",
    "however , in contrast to previous freeze - out criteria @xcite , this condition does not only depend on the medium , but also on the particle momentum .",
    "moreover , we can access some properties of the whole four - dimensional freeze - out region by varying the threshold value for @xmath108 . in this way",
    ", the above model calculations give some insight into freeze - out criteria which are more general than the cooper - frye type .",
    "to put in numbers : a realistic estimate of the transverse flow gradient @xmath109 and the bjorken freeze - out time @xmath110 is taken from @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath109 is also in agreement with hydrodynamic simulations @xcite . in order to achieve the escape probability of at least 1/3",
    ", the opacity integral must be smaller than @xmath111 .",
    "then , eq .   leads to a scattering rate of less than @xmath112 while eq .",
    "puts the upper limit for the scattering rate to @xmath113 . at a temperature of 120  mev",
    ", such a low value of the scattering rate is possibly reached at rhic for @xmath114 and at sps at @xmath115 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] .",
    "if we increase the required escape probability to 1/2 , the scattering rate must be smaller 0.11 or 0.16 , according to eqs . and , respectively . for particles with @xmath116 ,",
    "the temperature has to drop to 100  mev if @xmath108 should reach 1/2 .",
    "particles with @xmath117 must wait even longer .",
    "on the other hand , if we put the required value of @xmath108 to 0.1 , eq",
    ".   leads to an upper bound of @xmath118 for the scattering rate . in the case of @xmath119 and high @xmath94 s at rhic pions with @xmath120",
    "fulfill this condition ; in the less extreme cases , the 10% escape probability is reached by almost all pions .",
    "this illustrates that particles decouple from the fireball gradually .",
    "it indicates that @xmath121 10% of the pions are decoupled at @xmath119 , but approximately half of them will escape at local temperatures below 100  mev .",
    "thus , a large fraction of the particles decouples at rather low temperatures .",
    "we note that a temperature of 120  mev was assumed as a freeze - out temperature in a recent work @xcite where a pion mean free path @xmath122 was suggested as the universal freeze - out criterion .",
    "this work neglects the temperature dependence of the escape probability and its dependence on the momentum of the particle .",
    "also , it does not consider the possible cancellation between stronger scattering and stronger transverse expansion . in our approach ,",
    "a thermal distribution of @xmath119 at rhic results in a pion mean free path of only 1.7  fm , only slightly larger than @xcite .",
    "however , only 10 % of all particles are decoupled at this temperature . at lower temperatures , where the fraction of decoupled particles reaches 50% , we find a significantly larger average pion mean free path of at least 35  fm .",
    "let us further comment on the significance of the momentum dependence of the scattering rate .",
    "as discussed earlier , at certain @xmath103 the particle has a momentum with respect to the surrounding medium @xmath123 , and thus the @xmath103-dependence of the scattering rate can be flatter than what is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] .",
    "we expect , however , that the monotonic increase of the escape probability with @xmath103 will be robust against refinements of our calculation .",
    "this suggests that in contrast to the idealization of a sharp freeze - out along a three - dimensional hypersurface , particle escape is ordered in momentum with high-@xmath103 particles freezing - out earlier and thus originating from a smaller fireball .",
    "this effect could lead to a stronger transverse mass dependence of hbt radii @xcite than what is found in current model studies based on a cooper - frye freeze - out condition .",
    "these latter models ( see e.g. the _ blast - wave model _ discussed in @xcite ) have difficulties in reproducing the observed strong @xmath124-dependence of hbt radii at rhic . in what concerns the mechanism proposed here",
    ", one may envisage compensating effects : for example , if the transverse flow gradient is stronger at later times , then this will reduce the homogeneity regions measured by hbt radii at later times .",
    "such a scenario seems unlikely since it implies acceleration of the collective expansion at a time when particles slowly cease to interact .",
    "however , to substantiate this expectation , a model which fully implements the fireball dynamics is needed . in our opinion , this warrants further investigations .",
    "in particular , hydrodynamical simulations should be revisited , which are typically based on sharp 3-dimensional freeze - out and thus miss any contribution from freeze - out along finite four - volumes .",
    "we thank j.g .",
    "cramer , u.  heinz , j.  pit , and k.  redlich for fruitful discussions .",
    "here , we give further details on the relation between the dilution rate and the scattering rate . we start from the opacity integral and we express the exponent @xmath26 in terms of the dilution rate @xmath34 via eq .  .",
    "this leads to @xmath125 this can be directly compared to the statement @xcite that freeze - out happens when the dilution rate is at least as big as the scattering rate . for the scenario of continuous freeze - out considered here ,",
    "a reasonable escape probability is reached when the opacity integral is of order one or smaller . in the model of eqs .   and",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath126",
    "i.e. , there is a factor @xmath127 in addition to the standard criterion @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "the details of the relation between the scattering rate and the dilution rate at the freeze - out will depend on the particular time evolution of @xmath31 and @xmath90 , but the feature that larger @xmath31 can be compensated by larger @xmath34 is generic .",
    "in this appendix we derive a general expression for the scattering rate .",
    "this allows us to investigate its dependences on temperature and the test particle momentum .    following eq .",
    "we write the scattering for some particle species of mass @xmath129 . assuming a boltzmann distribution of the scattering partners and suppressing the position dependence ,",
    "@xmath130 if we change the integration variables to the center of mass energy @xmath100 and the energy of the scattering partner @xmath131 , and perform the @xmath131-integration , this integral leads to @xmath132 this scattering rate can be expressed as a convolution of the cross - section with the _ `` distribution of two - particle approaches '' _",
    "@xmath133 @xmath134 by comparing with , we obtain @xmath135 in the arguments of the exponential functions of , the momentum of the test particle and the temperature are inversely related . thus if one ignores the @xmath136 pre - factor , increasing @xmath69 has the same effect as decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "this offers an explanation why @xmath137 increases with raising the temperature but decreases when the momentum becomes larger .",
    "there is no collision dynamics going into the calculation of @xmath138 ; it represents merely the phase - space populated with thermally distributed scattering partners .",
    "however , the temperature and momentum dependence of the scattering rate is not given solely by the distribution of two - particle approaches , but also reflects details of the convolution of @xmath133 with the scattering cross section @xmath139 .",
    "this can be seen e.g.  by comparing our results with those obtained in @xcite . in that paper",
    ", the authors used a simple prescription @xmath140 which leads to a qualitatively different dependence of the scattering rate on the test particle momentum .",
    "we verified that this is a consequence of neglecting the width of the resonance . by only assuming the lowest resonance states in a given channel and narrowing the resonance shape",
