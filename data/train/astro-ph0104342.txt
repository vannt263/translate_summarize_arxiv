    "mcg6 - 30 - 15  is a bright nearby ( @xmath1 ) seyfert 1 galaxy , and has thus been observed by various x - ray telescopes over the last 20 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies culminated in the first detection of a relativistically broadened iron k@xmath0 line @xcite .",
    "the shape of the line is consistent with being emitted from fluorescing , optically thick material which is orbiting very close to a black hole @xcite , and is difficult to explain by other processes @xcite .",
    "subsequent deep _ asca _ observations have found evidence for broad fe  k@xmath0  lines in other seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite , illustrating that these features may be common in type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . due to the proximity of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ,",
    "its fe  k@xmath0  line has been studied many times at high signal - to - noise and has been shown to be variable , both in strength and in shape @xcite .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter br01 ) reported results from observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15  and another seyfert 1 galaxy mrk  766 using the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on _ xmm - newton_. these authors claim that features in the soft x - ray band that were traditionally interpreted in lower - resolution data as photoelectric absorption edges could actually be relativistically broadened k@xmath0 lines of o  viii , n  vii and c  vi .",
    "however , a non - simultaneous observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15  by the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) on _ chandra _ ( which has higher spectral resolution than the rgs ) does not confirm the above interpretation @xcite .",
    "these authors find that the spectral features in the soft x - rays are well fit by a dusty warm absorber model .",
    "regardless of which interpretation is correct , the idea of other relativistic emission lines in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies is intriguing , and is worth further investigation .",
    "this can be done by employing ionized reflection models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to predict the reflection spectrum from an ionized disc .",
    "these models can not be fit to grating data as there is no fe  k@xmath0  line or easily determined continuum to `` anchor '' the model .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we pursue a complementary approach , and fit the hard x - ray spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15  from _ asca _ , thereby taking advantage of the well - defined fe  k@xmath0  line and continuum to fix the parameters of the model . although the model is fit only to the high energy data it will have specific predictions for the strength of the soft x - ray spectral features , which may be useful in the interpretation of the grating data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sect .",
    "[ sect : fits ] , we describe the ionized disc model that is used and present our fits to the _ asca _ data of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "then we discuss the strength of the predicted low - energy features and other consequences of our model in sect .",
    "[ sect : disc ] . finally , conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "[ sect : concl ] .",
    "long observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15  were obtained by _ asca _ in 1994 ( 200  ks ) , 1997 ( 200  ks ) and 1999 ( 400  ks ) .",
    "a description of the data reduction can be found in the paper by @xcite for the 1994 data and in the paper by @xcite for the 1997 data .",
    "analogous procedures were used in the reduction of the unpublished 1999 data , except for the inclusion of a new cti file ( ` sisph2pi_130201.fits ` ) to deal with recent calibration problems in the sis detectors .",
    "fits were performed using the time - averaged data from all four detectors between 3 and 10  kev .",
    "since the _ asca _ detectors had yet to suffer much damage , and the calibration is now well established , the experimental fitting was done using the 1994 data .",
    "the model that best fit this dataset was then used on the 1997 and 1999 dataset to check the robustness of the model and to investigate variations in the parameters .",
    "the ionized reflection models were computed with the code described by @xcite .",
    "these simulations compute the reflection spectrum as well as the temperature , ionization and density structure of the top five thomson depths of an accretion disc that is irradiated by a power - law continuum of x - rays . as shown by @xcite , the features in the reflection spectrum",
    "depend on the system parameters ( such as black hole mass , accretion rate and radius along the disc ) , on the value of the irradiating flux and photon index of the incident spectrum ( @xmath2 ) , and the incidence angle of the radiation ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the reflection spectra that were fit to the _ asca _ data of mcg6 - 30 - 15  were computed assuming a black hole mass of 10@xmath4  m@xmath5 , an accretion rate of 0.01 times the eddington rate ( so the disc was radiation pressure dominated ) , and that the reflection was occurring at 4 schwarszchild radii from the black hole .",
    "these values are appropriate for a typical seyfert  1 galaxy like mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the choice of irradiating flux and incidence angle should ideally be determined by a specific model for how an accretion disc is illuminated .",
    "we have chosen an illuminating flux to disc flux ratio of 10 ( as might be appropriate for irradiation by magnetic flares , e.g. , @xcite ) , and an incidence angle of @xmath6 degrees to the normal ( so that @xmath7 , a crude approximation to isotropic illumination ) was assumed .    with these parameters fixed , two sets of reflection spectra",
    "were calculated with @xmath2 varied between 1.5 and 2.15 : one with solar abundance of fe ( as given by @xcite ) and the other with twice solar fe abundance .",
    "each set was weighted by the reflection fraction @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and then added to the illuminating power - law .",
    "finally , both 2-dimensional grids were converted into a xspec ` atable ' file for use in fitting the data .",
    "relativistic blurring appropriate for a schwarszchild metric and assuming a disc emissivity law ( i.e. , emissivity @xmath10 ; @xcite ) was applied to the spectra during fitting .",
    "the xspec command ` extend ' was used to increase the energy range of the response matrices because this convolution requires evaluating the model at energies outside the 310  kevrange . galactic absorption",
    "was also included in the fit and fixed at the value of @xmath11  @xmath12 , but will have a negligible affect at energies greater than 3  kev .",
    "xspec  v.11.0.1z1 @xcite was used for fitting , and the uncertainties in the model parameters are the 1-@xmath13 errorbars for one interesting parameter .",
    "the results of the spectral fitting are shown in table  [ table : fits1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we find that neutral reflection from a large region of the disc can account for the second fe  k@xmath0  line component .",
    "however , this result is not unique , as ionized reflection from a smaller , more central region of the disc can also fit the data .",
    "if the second fe  k@xmath0  line component results from another illumination event then it is not necessary for the @xmath2 of the two events to be the same , and the observed photon - index is a weighted sum of the two .",
    "models of this type were constructed using two hydrostatic ionized disc models , and the results are also shown in table  [ table : fits2 ] .",
    "a decent fit to the 1994 data was found with the inner reflector subject to a @xmath14 power - law and the outer to a softer @xmath15 power - law , although a very low value of the inclination angle was found in this case suggesting further reflection components are necessary .",
    "these results emphasize that it is very difficult to fit the 1994 hard x - ray spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15  with a simple ionized disc model .",
    "at least two different reflection components are needed to adequately fit the fe  k@xmath0  line profile which suggests a very complicated illumination geometry .",
    "however , multiple fe  k@xmath0  line components are a natural consequence of the magnetic flare model , and could provide the explanation to the perplexing variability of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "in contrast , a very acceptable fit to the same data was obtained using just one reflection component from a predominantly neutral disc which suggests a very simple illumination geometry .",
    "unfortunately , current data can not distinguish between the two cases , but our calculations show that measurements of soft x - ray disc emission features could lead to constraints on the ionization state of the accretion disc surface .",
    "the main results of this paper are :    * the 1994 , 1997 and 1999 _ asca _ observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15  can be fit with a relativistic ionized disc model which has twice solar fe abundance .",
    "however , a diskline component must be included to fully account for the shape of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "* alternatively , the 1994 data can be well fit by a single reflection component from a weakly ionized ( @xmath16 ) constant density disc with twice solar fe abundance . in this case",
    ", one cold fe  k@xmath0  line at 6.4  kev  can completely describe the observed line .",
    "* both reflection models predict that the ew of the o viii k@xmath0 line is @xmath17  ev .",
    "this can be made larger by increasing the o abundance , but o  vii lines will eventually become prominent .",
    "the ionized disc models also predict that fe  xvii & fe  xviii l@xmath0 lines will be found along with the o  viii line . *",
    "these results cast doubt on the claims of relativistic lines found in the soft x - rays by br01 because broad fe l lines are not seen in their spectra , and ews@xmath18  ev are required for the o viii and c vi lines .",
    "however , mcg6 - 30 - 15  was in an unusually low state when observed by br01 , so we can not strictly rule out their result .",
    "* emission from multiple regions on the disc was needed to adequately fit the fe  k@xmath0  line profile with the ionized disc models .",
    "the data are unable to distinguish between secondary reflection from a flared disc , or from other independent illumination / reflection events .",
