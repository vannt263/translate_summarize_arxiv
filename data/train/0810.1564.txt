    "superconductivity which arises from the pairing of electrons in time reversed states is well understood as a weak coupling `` fermi surface '' instability  a consequence of arbitrarily weak effective attractive interactions.@xcite in this paper we explore a new type of superconducting state , a `` pair density wave '' ( pdw ) , which is a distinct state of matter , and which does not occur under generic circumstances in the weak coupling limit ",
    "it requires interactions in excess of a critical strength .",
    "the pdw spontaneously breaks the global gauge symmetry , in precisely the same way as a conventional superconductor does .",
    "thus , the order parameter is a charge 2@xmath6 complex scalar field , @xmath2 .",
    "however , it also spontaneously breaks some of the translational and point group symmetries of the host crystal , in the same way as a conventional charge - density wave ( cdw ) . in a pdw , for fixed @xmath7 ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath8 is a periodic function of the center of mass coordinate , @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the electron creation operator at position @xmath11 with spin polarization @xmath12 .",
    "we will focus on the case in which translational symmetry is broken only in one direction , _",
    "i.e. _ a unidirectional pdw or equivalently a `` striped superconductor . ''",
    "accompanying the pdw there is , as we will show below , induced cdw order with half the period of the pdw .",
    "however , the pdw differs from a state of coexisting superconducting and cdw order@xcite , which has also been previously called a `` pair - density wave''.@xcite unlike the pair - density - wave state of ref .",
    "[ ] , the average value of the superconducting order parameter vanishes for the pdw state we discuss here .",
    "this is a defining symmetry property of this state .",
    "the pdw is more closely analogous to the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state fflo which arises , under appropriate circumstances , when the electron gas is partially polarized by an applied magnetic field .",
    "however , explicit time - reversal symmetry breaking is an essential ingredient of the fflo state , and is responsible for lifting the degeneracy ( `` nesting '' ) between time - reversed pairs of quasiparticle states . in the absence of quenched disorder , the pdw state preserves time - reversal symmetry.@xcite    in general , there is no necessary relation between spin - density wave ( sdw ) and pdw order  whatever relation there is derives from common microscopic physics rather than from general symmetry conditions .",
    "however , the two orders can be linked if one postulates a larger , emergent so(5 ) symmetry@xcite which unifies the superconducting and sdw orders . in this context ,",
    "an early speculation@xcite concerning the existence of a unidirectional so(5 ) spiral density wave state is particularly interesting.@xcite such a state would consist of interleaving sdw and superconducting spirals , both with the same period .",
    "the fact that this state is a spiral implies that the phase of @xmath13 varies as a function of position , and hence that there are equilibrium currents .",
    "thus , the so(5 ) spiral , though similar to a state of coexisting pdw and collinear sdw order , is not the same .",
    "we have not found any microscopic model that supports a spiral - pdw phase - whether coexisting with sdw order , or not .",
    "however , it is an interesting state and deserves further study.@xcite many features of the superconducting state depend only on the existence of a charge @xmath14 order parameter .",
    "this includes zero resistance , the meissner effect , flux quantization and , in 3d , the existence of a finite critical current .",
    "therefore , these properties are expected in a pdw ( in the absence of quenched disorder ) .    however , other properties are very different . for instance , in an s - wave superconductor , there is a full gap in the quasiparticle spectrum . for a d - wave superconductor , there are typically nodal points on the fermi surface which support gapless quasiparticle excitations , but the density of states still vanishes at the fermi energy , even in the presence of coexisting cdw or most forms of sdw order@xcite . in contrast , in a pdw portions of the fermi surface are typically ungapped , which as in the case of many cdws , results in the reconstruction , but incomplete gapping of the underlying fermi surface@xcite . in a conventional superconductor ,",
    "the anisotropy of the superconducting coherence length is determined by the anisotropy of the single - electron effective mass ; in a pdw , depending on the precise character of the translation symmetry breaking , the anisotropy of the superconducting state can be parametrically larger than the normal state resistivity anisotropy .",
    "perhaps the most significant new feature of a pdw superconductor is its anomalous sensitivity to ( non - magnetic ) quenched disorder , in stark comparison to a conventional superconductor .",
    "specifically , although the disorder potential does not couple directly to the superconducting order parameter , it produces random variations in the magnitude _ and sign _ of the local superfluid density .",
    "hence quenched disorder can readily drive a pdw into a superconducting xy glass phase .",
    "( a similar effect was recently predicted @xcite in a d - wave superconductor near the critical point of the superconductor to metal transition . )",
    "table [ tab : phases ] characterizes the pdw , cdw , and uniform superconducting ( sc ) phases by their order parameters and their sensitivity to quenched disorder . here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the uniform sc and pdw ( modulated sc ) order parameters ( where @xmath17 is the ordering wavevector ) , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the two relevant cdw order parameters . by definition ,",
    "the pure pdw phase has non - zero @xmath16 and a vanishing @xmath15 .",
    "it is thus different from a phase of coexisting sc and cdw  order , which has a non - zero @xmath15 _ and _ @xmath20 ( as well as a subsidiary @xmath21 order ) .",

    "considerable indirect evidence in favor of the existence of pdw order in this material has recently been gathered and compiled in ref .",
    "the putative pdw order has the same period as the unidirectional ( spin - stripe ) sdw order which is known , from neutron scattering studies , to exist in this materialtranquada95,kivelson03 .",
    "strong evidence that a striped sc can be induced in underdoped la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 by the application of a transverse magnetic field , which is also known to induce spin stripe order , has also recently been presented in ref .",
    "the behavior of la@xmath3ba@xmath26cuo@xmath27 is very striking , and rather complex .",
    "we will not elaborate upon it here ( see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "however , there are two qualitative features of the data on which we would like to focus : 1 ) with the onset of stripe spin order at 42 k,@xcite there is a large ( in magnitude ) and strongly temperature dependent enhancement of the anisotropy of the resistivity and other properties , such that below 42 k the in - plane charge dynamics resembles those of a superconductor , while in the c - direction the system remains poorly metallic .",
    "the most extreme illustration of this occurs in the temperature range @xmath28 , in which the in - plane direction resistivity is immeasurably small , while the c - axis resistivity is in the 1 - 10 m@xmath29 range , so the resistivity anisotropy ratio is consistent with infinity .",
    "2 ) despite the fact that many clear signatures of superconductivity onset at temperatures in excess of 40 k , and that angle resolved photoemission has inferred a `` gap '' @xcite of order 20 mev , the fully superconducting state ( _ i.e. _ the meissner effect and zero resistance in all directions ) only occurs below a critical temperature of 4 k. it is very difficult to imagine a scenario in which a strong conventional superconducting order develops locally on such high scales , but fully orders only at such low temperatures in a system that is three dimensional , non - granular in structure , and not subjected to an external magnetic field .",
    "we will see that both these qualitative features of the problem are natural consequences of the assumed existence of a pdw .",
    "indeed , analogous features have long been known to be a feature of the spin ordering in the same family of materials@xcite .",
    "specifically , unidirectional spin - stripe order is observed to occur under a number of circumstances in the 214 family of cuprate superconductors . however , when it occurs : 1 ) although the in - plane correlation length can be very long , in the range @xmath30 , the inter plane correlation length is never more than a few  , a degree of anisotropy that can not be reasonably explained simply@xcite on the basis of the anisotropy in the magnitude of the exchange couplings .",
    "2 ) despite the presence of long correlation lengths , true long - range spin - stripe order has never been reported .",
    "it will be made clear , below , that interlayer decoupling due to the geometry of the stripe order , and the rounding of the ordering transitions by quenched disorder can be understood as arising from closely analogous considerations applied to incommensurate sdw and pdw order@xcite .",
    "if @xmath31 , the system forms a striped superconducting ( or pdw ) state.,width=226 ]    at first , the notion that a pdw   phase could be stable sounds absurd . intuitively , the superconducting state can be thought of as the condensed state of charge 2e bosons .",
    "however , in the absence of magnetic fields , the ground - state of a bosonic fluid is always node - less , independent of the strength of the interactions , and therefore can not support a state in which the superconducting order parameter changes sign .",
    "thus , for a pdw   state to arise , microscopic physics at scales less than or of order the pair - size , @xmath32 , must be essential .",
    "this physics reflects an essential difference between superfluids of paired fermions and preformed bosonsspivakkivelson .",
    "our goal in this section is to shed some light on the mechanism by which strongly interacting electrons can form a superconducting ground - state with alternating signs of the order parameter .",
    "we will consider the case of a unidirectional ( striped ) superconductor , but the same considerations apply to more general forms of pdw order .",
    "we will not discuss the origin of the pairing which leads to superconductivity .",
    "likewise , we will not focus on the mechanism of translation symmetry breaking by the density wave , as that is similar to the physics of cdw and sdw formation .",
    "our focus is on the _ sign alternation _ of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in much of this discussion , we will adopt the model shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ stripedsc ] , in which we have alternating stripes of superconductor and correlated insulator .",
    "the system looks like an array of extended superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions , and we will primarily be concerned with computing the josephson coupling across the insulating barriers . if the effective josephson coupling is positive , then a uniform phase ( normal ) superconducting state is favored , but if the coupling is negative ( favoring a @xmath23 junction ) , then a striped superconducting phase is found .",
    "so long as time reversal symmetry is neither spontaneously nor explicitly broken , the josephson coupling , @xmath33 between two superconductors must be real .",
    "if it is positive , as is the usual case ( for reasons that will be expanded upon in later subsections ) , the energy is minimized by the state in which the phase difference across the junction is 0 ; if it is negative , a phase difference of @xmath23 is preferred , leading to a `` @xmath23 junction . ''",
    "@xmath34 junctions have been shown , both theoretically and experimentally , to occur for two distinct reasons : they can be a consequence of strong correlation effectsspivakkivelson , otherpitheories , pijunctionsexperiments or magnetic ordering@xcite in the junction region between two superconductors , or due to the internal structure (  _ e.g. _ d - wave symmetry ) of the superconductors , themselvesvanharlingen , kirtley .    in the present paper",
    ", we will build on the first set of ideas . until now",
    ", @xmath35 junctions have been confined to systems in which the josephson tunneling is dominated by a single impurity site or quantum dot .",
    "it is non - trivial to extend this mechanism to the situation in which there is an extended barrier in which @xmath33 is proportional to the cross - sectional `` area '' of the junction@xcite . indeed , as we shall see below , under most circumstances , even in the case in which the josephson tunneling through an isolated impurity would produce a negative @xmath33 , for a barrier consisting of an extended area of identical impurities , @xmath33 will typically be positive .",
    "one thing that we achieve below is to obtain a proof that there are circumstances in which @xmath33 of such an extended barrier is negative , and to elucidate the conditions under which this occurs .    in the context of the cuprates",
    ", there have been several studies looking for a striped superconducting state in the @xmath36 or hubbard models .",
    "on the one hand , dmrg calculations by white and scalapino@xcite have consistently failed to find evidence in support of any sort of spontaneously occurring @xmath23 junctions . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of variational monte carlo calculations have concluded that the striped superconductor is either the ground - state of such a model@xcite , under appropriate circumstances , or at least close in energy to the true ground statepoilblanc08a , poilblanc08b .",
    "these variational calculations are certainly encouraging , in the sense that they suggest that there is no large energetic reason to rule out the existence of spontaneously occurring pdw order in strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "however , since no such state has yet been observed in dmrg or other `` unbiased '' studies of these models , we believe the mechanism of formation of these states , and indeed whether they occur at all in physically reasonable microscopic models , remain unsolved problems .",

    "this is _ not _ the physics we have in mind .",
    "however , since it is simple and well understood , we start with a highly artificial model in which d - wave symmetry gives rise to a striped superconductor .",
    "we consider the case of a d - wave superconductor in a square lattice , with a strong crystal field coupling which locks the lobes of the pair wave - function along the crystallographically defined x and y directions , as shown in fig .",

    "we imagine we have made a striped array in which the crystallographic axis rotates by @xmath40 between neighboring strips",
    ". since rotation by @xmath41 is a symmetry , every third strip is identical .",
    "however , the d - wave order parameter changes sign under this rotation .",
    "consequently , the ground - state is a striped superconductor in which the period of the superconducting order parameter is twice the period of the lattice structure .",
    "this is a very contrived example , in which the origin of the pdw does not require any strong coupling effects - it is derived from the internal structure of the pair - wave function .",
    "for the point of principle , _",
    "i.e. _ to establish the viability of a pdw as a phase of matter , this analysis is useful .",
    "however , for practical applications , a less contrived mechanism is needed .",
    "to start with , we consider a system consisting of three strips - a `` left '' superconductor described by a mean - field hamiltonian with gap function @xmath42 ( not to be confused with the order parameter of eq .  ) and quasiparticle energy @xmath43^{2}+|\\delta _ { l}(\\vec{k})|^{2}}$ ] , a `` right '' superconductor which is also described by a mean - field hamiltonian with the index @xmath44 replaced by @xmath45 , and between them a strongly correlated insulating `` barrier '' region . here @xmath46 is either a 1d vector ( if this is a line junction ) or a 2d vector if this is a planar junction . note that we have assumed",

    "the three decoupled subsystems are thus described by the hamiltonian @xmath48where , in the discussion below , we will consider several different examples for the insulating barrier .",

    "in the case of the ltt structure of la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 , the fact that the stripes in neighboring planes run at right angles to each other insures that ( in the absence of disorder ) , the josephson coupling between neighboring planes vanishes . strictly speaking",

    "however , at the very least , it means that the 3d superconducting state is enormously more anisotropic than would be expected on the basis of the bare electronic anisotropy . moreover , as long as superconducting coherence in a given plane is limited due to quenched disorder , if these higher order couplings are weak enough , they can be essentially ignored .    _ striped superconductors in strongly correlated models : _ while we have established , as a point of principle , that well defined models exist that support a pdw phase , it still makes sense to make predictions that can be tested in `` numerical experiments '' on @xmath36 and hubbard models .",

    "the sharp drop in the resistivity at the spin - ordering temperature , @xmath279k , is probably not a true phase transition , either , but rather marks the sudden onset of significant intermediate scale superconducting coherence .",
    "however , we suspect that local pairing correlations persist to higher temperatures ; as long as the spin order is strongly fluctuating at @xmath280 , we imagine that phase coherence between neighboring superconducting stripes is prevented , while for @xmath281 , antiphase superconducting correlations extend over multiple stripes .",

    ".    that having been said , it is striking how much the observed spectrum in la@xmath265ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 resembles the mean - field spectrum found under the assumption that there is large amplitude pdw ( striped ) order coexisting with small amplitude uniform superconducting order .",
    "the pdw has a large gap along the anti - nodal [ ( @xmath23,0 ) or ( 0,@xmath23 ) ] direction , and a fermi pocket in the nodal [ ( @xmath23,@xmath23 ) ] direction , whose spectral weight is considerable only along an open `` fermi arc '' region which nearly coincides with the bare fermi surface . if , in addition , there is a uniform d - wave component to the order parameter , this completes the gapping of the fermi surface . a spectrum that resembles",
    "the measured arpes spectrum in la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 can be obtained@xcite under the assumption that the pdw has a gap magnitude @xmath283mev , and uniform gap magnitude @xmath284mev .",
    "the arpes spectrum is always measured at temperatures well above the bulk superconducting @xmath285 , so to the extent that this identification is correct , what is being observed is a pseudo - gap . moreover , as mentioned above , the gap structure persists to temperatures above @xmath286 , although at the higher temperatures , the gap in the nodal regions decreases appreciably .",
    "much more detailed analysis of the energy , momentum , and temperature dependence of the arpes spectrum will be necessary to test this interpretation .",
    "_ relevance to other cuprates : _ we have summarized the evidence for a state with the symmetries of a pdw state ( or the glassy version of it ) in @xmath287 doped la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 .",
    "there is also evidence for dynamical layer decoupling effects in la@xmath288nd@xmath289sr@xmath4cuo@xmath27@xcite , and also in la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 in a magnetic field.lake,basov08 ( for the possible relevance of these ideas to certain heavy fermion and organic superconductors see [ ] . )    the quasiparticle spectrum of a pdw state has striking qualitative resemblance to the spectra seen in arpes in other cuprates , especially bscco 2212 and 2201 .",
    "this possibly sheds new light on the issue of the `` nodal - anti nodal dichotomy '' : according to this interpretation , both the nodal and the anti - nodal gaps are superconducting gaps , the first being uniform and the other modulated .",
    "there are two distinct types of order ( `` two gaps '' ) , but they are both superconducting , and so they can smoothly evolve into one another .",
    "perhaps , as the temperature is decreased , the pdw gradually decreases and the uniform order parameter increases , while their sum ( which is determined by relatively high energy microscopic physics ) remains approximately constant .",
    "( note that an early study@xcite of modulated structures seen in stm@xcite concluded that they could be understood in terms of just such a two - superconducting - gap state . )    more generally , one of the most remarkable features of the pseudo - gap phenomena is the existence of effects of superconducting fluctuations , detectable@xcite for instance in the nernst signal , over a surprisingly broad range of temperatures and doping concentrations . at a broad - brush level@xcite , these phenomena are a consequence of a phase stiffness scale that is small compared to the pairing scale . however , it is generally difficult to understand the existence of such a broad fluctuational regime on the basis of any sensible microscopic considerations .",
    "the glassy nature of the ordering phenomena in a pdw may hold the key to this central paradox of htc phenomenology , as it gives rise to an intrinsically broad regime in which superconducting correlations extend over large , but not infinite distances .",
