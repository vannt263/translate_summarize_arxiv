    "while supermassive black hole ( smbh ) growth and galaxy formation were once assumed to proceed independently of one another , a new picture is emerging in which common triggering and/or feedback mechanisms drive the formation and evolution of both smbhs and their hosts . to determine which processes ( e.g. , secular evolution or major galaxy mergers ) are primarily responsible for moving a galaxy onto the present - day m-@xmath6 relation , however , we first require a complete census of luminous agn activity .",
    "in x - rays , the typical agn outshines even the most actively star - forming galaxy , and as such , deep x - ray surveys provide the most reliable means of agn selection . however , while x - rays penetrate low to moderate columns of obscuring dust and gas , 2 - 10 kev x - ray surveys miss a significant fraction of moderately obscured agn ( @xmath7% at @xmath8  @xmath9 ) and nearly all compton - thick agn ( @xmath10  @xmath9 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the obscured and compton - thick agn missed in deep x - ray surveys therefore serve not only as important probes of smbh / galaxy co - evolution , but likely constitute a significant fraction of the total agn population at all luminosities .    to identify obscured agn",
    "not recovered by x - ray surveys , studies have turned to the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "not only does the mir emission from agn - heated dust trace the reprocessed radiation absorbed in other wavebands , but it is itself relatively insensitive to intervening obscuration .",
    "mir selection therefore identifies many heavily obscured agn , nearly half of which are missed in deep x - ray surveys @xcite . while many mir - based selection criteria are therefore designed to specifically target heavily obscured agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the irac color - color cuts most commonly used for agn selection were defined by @xcite and @xcite using shallow irac data to which additional flux cuts at 8  , 24  or r - band served to reject all but the brightest sources ( @xmath15  mjy , @xcite ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18jy , @xcite ; @xmath19  mjy , @xcite ) . while these initial color cuts therefore effectively select luminous agn in samples containing only agn and bright , low - redshift star - forming galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "this technique , however , depends on both the irac photometry and the often - underestimated photometric errors , adding a degree of complexity not present in simple color - color cuts .",
    "our understanding of the mir source population has increased substantially in recent years , thanks in part to the _ spitzer _  irs spectra now available for large samples of both local and high redshift sources , and in part to the availability of deep irac data in multi - wavelength survey fields .",
    "it is therefore time to revisit the irac selection of agn and redefine the selection criteria for use in deep survey fields .",
    "to do so , we focus on the 2  deg@xmath21 cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ?",

    "unlike the deeper great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields , the combined size and depth of cosmos provides large samples of both luminous agn and normal irac - detected star - forming galaxies out to @xmath22 .",

    "the premise behind irac agn selection is illustrated in figure 1 , where we plot composite agn@xmath25starburst seds constructed using the qso1 and m82 templates of @xcite .",
    "the seds of normal star - forming galaxies display a prominent dip between the 1.6  stellar bump and the long - wavelength emission from star - formation heated dust ( @xmath26  k ) .",
    "dust near an agn s central engine , however , can reach a sublimation temperature of @xmath27  k and thus radiate into the near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "if the agn is sufficiently luminous compared to its host galaxy , the superposition of black body emission from the agn - heated dust will fill in the dip in the galaxy s sed and produce a red , power - law like thermal continuum across the irac bands . as shown in figure 1 , while the uv - optical seds of obscured and unobscured agn bear little resemblance to one another , this characteristic mir spectral shape should remain so long as the obscuring medium is optically thin at nir - mir wavelengths .",
    "the optical thickness of the obscuring medium at nir - mir wavelengths depends on the structure of the torus .",
    "a smooth and geometrically thick torus will obscure even the mir emission from type 2 agn , leading to a large offset in mir luminosity between type 1 and type 2 agn @xcite .",
    "while no studies have observed the degree of mir anisotropy predicted by smooth torus models , type 2 agn do appear to be @xmath28 fainter in the mir than type 1 agn when the radio continuum luminosity is used to constrain the agn s intrinsic luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , no offset in mir luminosity is observed when the agn luminosity is instead normalized by the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity and when the agn s contribution to the mir emission is isolated either spatially or spectrally @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the radio - based comparison may be biased , at least in part , by the contribution from beamed synchrotron emission in type 1 agn @xcite .",

    "irac power - law selection therefore depends not only on the irac flux densities used for color - color selection , but also on the irac errors typically derived using sextractor .",

    "furthermore , the cataloged measurement errors do not account for the irac calibration uncertainty , which is at best 3% and is at worst 10% when the sub - pixel response and the array - location - dependent changes in pixel solid angle and spectral response are not taken into account @xcite .",
    "the sextractor errors can therefore be as low as @xmath81 = 0.1% for our irac sample , with the brightest irac sources exhibiting the most underestimated errors .",
    "using such highly underestimated errors , it becomes nearly impossible to obtain a statistically acceptable fit to a given sed , even when the sed appears to closely match the photometry .",
    "as an example , consider the 25 _ xmm _  sources that lie in the immediate vicinity ( within @xmath82  dex ) of the @xmath83 power - law locus .",
    "using the flux densities and errors from the official cosmos irac catalog , the power - law criterion is met by only 30% of the fainter half of the sample and by none of the brighter half of the sample .",

    "as shown in figure 5 , however , these red , power - law dominated agn occupy a well - defined region of @xcite irac color space .",

    "for the assumed column density distribution , the recovered x - ray type 2 fraction is overestimated by only 4% at at @xmath119 , the approximate redshift of the bluest _ xmm _  sources in figure 7 . however , at @xmath120 , the typical redshift of the reddest _ xmm _  sources , the observed type 2 fraction is likely to be overestimated by @xmath287 .",
    "this overestimation of the x - ray type 2 fraction at high redshift contributes to the apparent discrepancies between x - ray and optically - classified agn ( see  5 and  6 ) ."
