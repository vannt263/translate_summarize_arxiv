    "the fly s eye @xcite and agasa @xcite experiments confirmed the existence of a break in the energy spectrum of high energy cosmic rays at @xmath7 , for which evidence existed with weaker statistics in the data of previous experiments ( haverah park , yakutsk , sugar , see e.g. @xcite for a review )",
    ". fly s eye data also strengthen the evidence for a change in primary composition from predominantly heavy nuclei below the break to predominantly light nuclei above the break .",
    "these features strongly suggest , when coupled with the lack of anisotropy that would be expected for cosmic - rays ( crs ) of galactic origin , that below @xmath8 the crs are mostly heavy ions of galactic origin , and that an extra - galactic component of protons dominates above @xmath9 .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the fact that the cr energy spectrum is consistent with a cosmological distribution of sources of protons , with injection spectrum @xmath10 typically expected for fermi acceleration @xcite . in particular , there is evidence for the existence of a greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) `` cutoff '' , i.e. for the suppression of cr flux above @xmath11 expected due to interaction of protons with the microwave background radiation @xcite .    the evidence for gzk suppression is strengthened by recent agasa data @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 , the cr spectrum reported by the fly s eye and the agasa experiments @xcite is compared with the flux expected for a homogeneous cosmological distribution of sources , each generating a power law differential spectrum of high energy protons @xmath10 ( for the model calculation we have used a flat universe with zero cosmological constant , @xmath12 , and time independent energy generation rate per comoving unit volume @xmath13 ; the spectrum is insensitive to the cosmological parameters and to source evolution , since most of the cosmic rays arrive from distances @xmath14gpc @xcite ) .",
    "the deficit in the number of events detected above @xmath15 , compared to a power - law extrapolation of the flux at lower energy , is consistent with that expected due to a cosmological gzk suppression . however , with current data the `` cutoff '' is detected with only @xmath16 significance @xcite .",
    "the number of events detected above @xmath17ev is consistent with that expected based on the cosmological model presented in fig .",
    "1 ( there is an apparent `` gap '' between the highest and second highest energy events detected by the fly s eye @xcite . however , assuming that the cosmological model is valid , the probability that such an apparent `` gap '' would be observed is @xmath18 @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of @xmath3ev events does pose challenges to most models of cr production .",
    "the high energies rule out most of the acceleration mechanisms so far discussed @xcite , and since the distance traveled by such particles must be smaller than @xmath19 @xcite due to their interaction with the micro - wave background , their arrival directions are inconsistent with the position of astrophysical objects , e.g. jets of powerful radio galaxies @xcite , that are likely to produce high energy particles @xcite .    cosmological @xmath20-ray bursts ( grbs )",
    "are likely sources of high - energy crs , which may account for the cr flux above @xmath21ev as well as for the @xmath3ev events @xcite .",
    "this model recently gained support form grb afterglow observations @xcite .",
    "other models for the production of ultra - high energy crs were suggested , where the highest energy events are produced by the decay of super - massive elementary particles related to grand unified theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent review ) .",
    "sources of such particles may be topological defects , left over from a phase transition associated with the symmetry breaking of the grand unified theory @xcite . while no firm prediction exists of the cr flux in these theories ,",
    "a generic feature of the super - massive particle decay scenarios is that the injection spectrum is much harder than expected for fermi acceleration .",
    "therefore , this scenario can account only for the flux of @xmath3ev particles , and can not simultaneously explain the origin of @xmath21@xmath17ev crs .",
    "it has recently been suggested that annihilation of high energy , @xmath0ev , neutrinos on big bang relic neutrinos of @xmath1ev mass , clustered in the galactic halo or in a nearby galaxy cluster halo , may generate high energy nucleons and photons which may account for the detected flux of @xmath3ev cosmic - rays @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath22ev neutrino flux was argued plausible based on the argument that the mechanism producing the observed high energy , @xmath6ev , particles , most likely protons , also produces charged pions of comparable energy , which subsequently decay to produce neutrinos .",
    "it was suggested that the generation spectrum extends well beyond @xmath17ev , and that while nucleons produced by a distant source , e.g. a powerful radio galaxy , lose their energy interacting with the micro - wave background , high - energy neutrinos propagate without energy losses and may annihilate on relic neutrinos , producing @xmath3ev nucleons and photons at small distances that would allow them to propagate to earth . in sec .",
    "2 we derive the energy density of high energy neutrinos required to account for the observed rate of @xmath3ev air showers .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in sec .",
    "hot big bang cosmology predicts the existence of a neutrino background , similar to the photon micro - wave background .",
    "the energy distribution of neutrinos ( of mass @xmath23 below 1mev , the decoupling temperature ) is predicted to be a fermi - dirac distribution with temperature smaller than that of the photon background , @xmath24k , by a factor @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding number density of neutrinos is @xmath26 , with a similar density of anti - neutrinos ( we assumed a single helicity state ; the presence of two helicity states would increase the density by at most a factor 2 , and will not change the conclusions derived below ) .",
    "neutrino mass smaller than @xmath27ev is consistent with big bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are several indications that neutrinos are indeed massive .",
    "the simplest explanation for the discrepancy between observed and predicted solar neutrino fluxes ( see @xcite for a review ) involves @xmath28 oscillations driven by neutrino mass difference , and the common explanation to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly involves @xmath29 oscillations .",
    "while the mass difference implied for @xmath28 oscillations is much smaller than @xmath30 , the common explanation to the atmospheric anomaly is oscillation to @xmath31 with mass @xmath32ev @xcite .    high energy neutrinos may interact with the background neutrinos and annihilate , producing @xmath2-bosons which immediately decay , with @xmath33 probability for hadronic decay . with standard weak interaction ,",
    "the annihilation cross section is strongly peaked at the resonant neutrino energy @xmath34 , and the energy - averaged cross section , defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the square of the center of momentum energy , is @xmath37 cm @xcite .",
    "the relative energy width of the resonance peak ( fwhm ) is @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath2 decay produces on average 2.7 nucleons and anti - nucleons , and 30 high energy photons through @xmath39 decay . a single nucleon carries , on average , a fraction @xmath40 of the @xmath2 energy @xcite , and a single photon carries , on average , energy lower by a factor of @xmath41 compared to the nucleon energy @xcite . for a neutrino mass @xmath42ev for the background neutrinos , the highest energy nucleons produced by the decay of @xmath2-bosons created from annihilation of resonant ( @xmath43 ) high energy neutrinos and background neutrinos have energy @xmath44ev , and could in principle account for the observed highest energy cr events .",
    "let us first consider the rate of high energy showers due to annihilation of high energy neutrinos with a homogeneous neutrino background .",
    "the rate per unit volume of @xmath2 production is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number density of background neutrinos ( or anti - neutrinos ) and @xmath47 is the number density per unit energy of high energy neutrinos .",
    "we note here that , as suggested by oscillation evidence , neutrino flavor eigenstates may be different than their mass eigenstates , and since neutrinos produced by astrophysical sources are expected to be electron and muon neutrinos from pion decay , the @xmath2 production rate is smaller than given by ( [ nz ] ) by a factor @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the flavor eigenstate and @xmath50 is the massive neutrino eigenstate .",
    "if , as suggested by present data , the massive , @xmath51ev , neutrino is mainly mixed with @xmath31 , then the annihilation rate of @xmath52 expected to be produced by astrophysical sources will be smaller than given in ( [ nz ] ) .",
    "however , since we are interested in obtaining a lower limit to the density of high energy neutrinos required to produce @xmath53 high enough to account for the observed flux of crs above @xmath17 , we conservatively assume that @xmath48 is of order unity for the high energy neutrinos .",
    "the integral in ( [ nz ] ) is dominated by the contribution from @xmath54 .",
    "we may therefore replace the derivative @xmath47 in the integrand with its value at @xmath55 . for @xmath56ev",
    "the background neutrinos are nonrelativistic , and the square of the center of momentum energy is @xmath57 .",
    "changing the integration variable @xmath58 to @xmath36 , we find @xmath59 _ { \\epsilon=\\epsilon^r}. \\label{nza}\\ ] ] the high - energy protons and photons produced by @xmath2 decay lose energy as they propagate through the microwave background .",
    "this limits the distance out to which @xmath2 decays contribute to the observed rate of air showers above @xmath17ev to @xmath60mpc .",
    "the flux per solid angle of high energy cosmic - rays producing showers above @xmath17ev , and originating in @xmath2 decays , is therefore @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the average number of protons and photons above @xmath17ev produced by the decay of a @xmath2-boson of energy @xmath43 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ nza],[jcr ] ) we may derive the number density @xmath63_{\\epsilon=\\epsilon^r}$ ] of high energy neutrinos in the energy range @xmath64 around @xmath55 , required to produce a given cr flux @xmath65 , @xmath66_{\\epsilon=\\epsilon^r}= { 4\\pi j_{cr}\\over c n_b\\bar\\sigma r_{cr } n_{cr}(m_\\nu)}. \\label{n}\\ ] ] the total energy density associated with high energy neutrinos is expected to be larger by a factor @xmath67 than the energy @xmath68 associated with neutrinos in the energy range @xmath69 , since one does not expect the neutrino energy distribution to be strongly peaked at @xmath43 . if the high energy neutrino flux is indeed produced by the sources of @xmath6ev crs",
    ", then one expects the neutrino distribution to be approximately given by @xmath70 @xcite , for which the energy density in neutrinos of energy @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the energy density of @xmath6ev neutrinos required to produce the observed rate of showers above @xmath17ev , @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , is @xmath74^{-1}\\,{\\rm erg / cm}^3 . \\label{e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75 depends only weakly on @xmath23 , since @xmath76ev independent of the value of @xmath23 . for @xmath56ev ,",
    "the resonant energy is @xmath77ev , and the average energy of the nucleons produced in the @xmath2 decay is @xmath78ev .",
    "since the average number of nucleons produce in the decay is 2.7 , we have @xmath76ev for @xmath56ev . for higher",
    "@xmath23 the resonant energy decreases , and only a small fraction of the resulting nucleons have energy above @xmath17ev . for @xmath79ev , @xmath80ev and since ( on average ) only @xmath81 of the nucleons carry @xmath82 the @xmath2 energy @xcite , we have @xmath83ev for @xmath79ev . for @xmath84ev ,",
    "the resonant energy is @xmath85ev , so that the average energy of the photons produced in the decay is @xmath86ev , and the photons also contribute to @xmath65 .",
    "since the average number of photons produced in the decay is 30 , we have @xmath76ev for @xmath84ev .",
    "the energy density @xmath75 , required for @xmath2 decays to contribute significantly to the observed rate of @xmath87ev air - showers , may be reduced if the local density of background neutrinos is higher than the average density @xmath46 , due to clustering . for @xmath56ev ,",
    "the background neutrinos are non - relativistic at present , and are expected to cluster in the gravitational potential wells of galaxies and clusters .",
    "let us first consider clustering in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the density of neutrinos in the galactic halo depends on the details of the halo formation .",
    "however , pauli s exclusion principle allows to put an upper limit to the number density @xmath88 of neutrinos clustered in the galactic halo .",
    "this limit is approximately given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the maximum momentum of bound neutrinos and @xmath91 is the galactic rotation speed .",
    "a limit lower by a factor of 2 is obtained by requiring the neutrino phase space density , approximately given by @xmath92 , to be smaller than the maximum phase space density of the uniform background , @xmath93 .",
    "this requirement follows from the assumption that neutrino clustering results from gravitational collapse of the uniform neutrino background . in this process",
    ", the phase space density is conserved along particle trajectories , and therefore the maximum phase space density can not increase @xcite . the neutrino density in the halo is therefore constrained by @xmath94 using eqs .",
    "( [ nza ] ) and ( [ jcr ] ) , replacing @xmath46 with @xmath88 and @xmath95 with the halo radius @xmath96 , we find that the ratio of the flux of @xmath3 nucleons and photons due to @xmath2 production by annihilation with neutrinos clustered in the galactic halo to the flux due to annihilation on the uniform background is @xmath97 thus , for @xmath56ev , the rate of @xmath3ev showers due to annihilation on neutrinos clustered in the galactic halo is two orders of magnitude smaller than that due to annihilation on the uniform neutrino background .",
    "the contribution of galactic halo neutrino annihilation increases with @xmath23 , and for @xmath98ev may be larger than the contribution due to annihilation on the uniform background by a factor @xmath41 .",
    "finally , let us consider the contribution to @xmath65 due to annihilation on background neutrinos clustered in a nearby galaxy cluster .",
    "the rate of @xmath2 production in the cluster is @xmath99_{\\epsilon=\\epsilon^r } , \\label{nz}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the cluster mass , and @xmath101 is the fraction of cluster mass contributed by ( background ) neutrinos .",
    "the cluster mass is given by its velocity dispersion @xmath102 and radius @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the ratio of high energy shower rate due to annihilation in the cluster , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the cluster distance , to that due to annihilation on the uniform background , @xmath107 , is @xmath108 clearly , the contribution to high energy showers from neutrino annihilation in a nearby galaxy cluster is much smaller that the contribution from annihilation on the uniform background .",
    "we note here that in deriving eq .",
    "( [ nz ] ) we have assumed that the neutrinos are non - degenerate , so that the fraction @xmath101 is not limited by pauli s principle .",
    "this is not valid for small @xmath23 .",
    "the cluster density at radius @xmath103 is @xmath109 , implying a neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) density @xmath110 this density is lower than the upper limit imposed by eq .",
    "( [ ng ] ) for @xmath111 where we have used @xmath112 . for @xmath113ev the neutrino density is limited by the exclusion principle , and the neutrino fraction of cluster mass is proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "thus , although for low @xmath23 , @xmath84ev , photons produced in the @xmath2 decay may contribute to the particle flux above @xmath17ev , the decrease in @xmath101 implies that the ratio @xmath115 is increasing with @xmath23 for @xmath113ev .",
    "we have shown that the energy density of high energy neutrinos required to generate the observed flux of @xmath3 crs by producing high energy nucleons and photons via the decay of @xmath2-bosons resulting from the annihilation of the high energy neutrinos on a uniform neutrino background is @xmath116 , independent of neutrino mass @xmath23 for @xmath117 ( cf .",
    "[ e ] ; the required energy density is higher for @xmath118ev , and for @xmath119ev the @xmath2 decay products are not energetic enough to account for the observed @xmath120ev crs ) .",
    "the @xmath3 cr flux produced by annihilation on background neutrinos clustered in a nearby galaxy cluster is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that due to annihilation on the uniform background , independent of the value of @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "( [ ec ] ) ) . for @xmath56ev , the cr flux resulting from annihilation on neutrinos clustered in the halo of our galaxy is smaller by at least a factor @xmath121 than that due to annihilation on the uniform background ( cf .",
    "( [ eg ] ) ) .",
    "the relative contribution of galactic halo neutrino annihilation increases with increasing @xmath23 , and may become comparable to the uniform neutrino background contribution for @xmath122ev . for @xmath79ev , annihilation on galactic halo neutrinos may dominate , giving a cr flux higher by a factor",
    "@xmath41 compared to the flux due to annihilation on the uniform background . in this case , the lower limit to the energy density of high energy neutrinos required to produce the observed flux of @xmath3ev crs is lowered by a factor of @xmath41 to @xmath123 .    for @xmath56ev ,",
    "the energy density in high energy neutrinos , @xmath116 , required to account for the observed flux of @xmath3ev crs is @xmath5 orders of magnitude higher than the energy density in observed @xmath6ev cosmic - rays , @xmath124 ( see fig .",
    "it is important to note here that although the life time of high energy neutrinos is longer than that of high energy protons , since @xmath21ev protons suffer energy loss due to pair production on the microwave background while neutrinos lose energy only due to redshift , the life time of a @xmath21ev proton , @xmath125yr , is comparable to the hubble time , @xmath126yr , and therefore to the neutrino life time",
    ". therefore , the average ( over time and volume ) energy generation rate of high energy neutrinos required to produce the neutrino energy density necessary to account for the @xmath3ev events is at least @xmath5 orders of magnitude higher than the generation rate @xmath127 of @xmath6ev protons required to account for the observed @xmath6ev cr flux @xcite . this implies that in order for neutrino annihilation to contribute significantly to the detected flux of @xmath3ev cosmic - rays , the existence of a new class of high - energy neutrino sources , likely unrelated to the sources of @xmath6ev cosmic - rays , must be invoked .",
