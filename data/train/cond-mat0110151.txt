    "perhaps the simplest systems which display the slow cooperative relaxation characteristic of glasses are the facilitated kinetic ising models , first introduced in @xcite , in which glassiness is not a consequence of either disorder or frustration in the interactions , but of the presence of kinetic constraints in the dynamics of the system .",
    "depending on the nature of the constraints these models may behave as strong @xcite or fragile @xcite glasses , display stretched exponential relaxation @xcite , fragile - to - strong transitions @xcite , etc .",
    "kinetically constrained systems are interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , they are usually free of disorder or frustration , and the interactions imposed by the constraints are short - ranged .",
    "second , their equilibrium static properties are trivial , so that their glassiness is a purely dynamical effect , in contrast to mean - field models @xcite where statics and dynamics are closely related @xcite .",
    "third , their low temperature behaviour is dominated by activated processes , which , although highly relevant for supercooled liquids near the glass transition , are not taken into account by mode - coupling theory @xcite or in mean - field @xcite .",
    "finally , the simplicity of these models may allow for exact solutions or at least a thorough analytical description of their behaviour , which can help to understand dynamically arrested systems in general .",
    "the rationale behind the kinetically constrained approach was most clearly given in @xcite : it should be possible to describe the dynamics of a strongly interacting system which displays glassy behaviour in terms of hierarchies of degrees of freedom , from fast to slow , independent of the presence of disorder or even frustration ; these hierarchies would be weakly interacting in the energetic sense , but their dynamics should be constrained , the faster modes constraining the slower ones .",
    "systems with explicit kinetic constraints , like the spin facilitated models or the constrained lattice gases @xcite , represent one side of this picture , but concrete examples in which this full scenario is realized are much harder to find .",
    "the purpose of this paper to address this issue by describing a simple class of models of interacting spins with ` normal ' dynamics which have a dual description in terms of free excitations whose dynamics is subject to effective kinetic constraints .",
    "they are thus an explicit realization of the constrained dynamics scenario of @xcite .",
    "consider the following model : a system of ising spins @xmath0 on a triangular lattice , where each spin interacts in triplets with its nearest - neighbours lying at the vertices of a downward - pointing triangles @xcite @xmath1 this system belongs to a class of models of ising spins interacting with its neighbours through plaquette interactions , such that the spins and bonds live in isomorphic lattices and there is one bond per spin .",
    "the simplest example is the one - dimensional ising model ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in two dimensions , in addition to model ( [ h3 ] ) , there is the plaquette model on the square lattice @xcite @xmath2 which is a special case of baxter s eight vertex model @xcite .",
    "these models can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "four spins interacting in the corners of downward pointing tetrahedra of an fcc lattice would be a generalization of ( [ h3 ] ) , while eight spin interactions in the vertices of cubes of a simple cubic lattice that of ( [ h4 ] ) .",
    "the sign of the couplings is irrelevant for large systems , and even disordered @xmath3 can be absorbed by a rescaling of the spins . in what follows",
    "@xmath4 is assumed .    below i",
    "will mainly focus on the triangular model of eq .",
    "( [ h3 ] ) , but it will be instructive to compare with the 1d ising model and the square plaquette model ( [ h4 ] ) .",
    "the common feature of the class of models of the previous section is that they all have , for appropriate boundary conditions , a one - to - one mapping between spin and bond ( or ` defect ' ) configurations . for the ising model on the line this happens if one boundary is fixed , say , @xmath5 , and the other free . in this case",
    "the spin to bond mapping and its inverse simply reads @xmath6 similarly , for the square plaquette model there is a @xmath7@xmath7 mapping if the spins on one boundary row and column are fixed , say , @xmath8 , and the other boundary is left free @xmath9 notice that , while the bonds are defined locally in terms of its surrounding spins , the inverse mapping is nonlocal . in order to derive it i made implicit use of the effect that introducing an excitation has in the ground state configuration @xmath10 , i.e. , how the spin configuration has to be rearranged to avoid any further defects .    for the more interesting case of the triangular plaquette model",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the spin - to - bond mapping is again straightforward @xmath11 where the indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 run along the unit vectors of the triangular lattice @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the inverse map can be obtained from the following observation @xcite .",
    "a ground state of the system can be constructed row by row : the state of one row of spins determines the following one .",
    "a row configuration can be specified by a dipolynomial ( i.e. , a generalization of a polynomial with terms with both positive and negative powers of the argument ) @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the spins on the row , and @xmath18 runs from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the horizontal length of the system .",
    "the following row @xmath22 is then given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the operator which propagates rows , and the coefficients in @xmath25 are taken modulo 2 .",
    "suppose a defect is created at position @xmath26 in a ground state of all spins up .",
    "the row just below the defect has a spin down at @xmath26 and its dipolynomial is @xmath27 .",
    "then the @xmath28th row below it will be given by @xmath29 , which means that the propagation of the original spin down produces other down spins at the positions for which the combinatorial numbers @xmath30 mod  2 are nonzero , a structure known as a pascal triangle ( pt ) , see fig .  1 .",
    "the spin configuration due to a configuration of defects is obtained by the superposition mod  2 of the pts that each individual defect generates and the ground state on which the excitation has been produced .",
    "= 2.5 in    if the system is of linear length a power of two and has periodic boundary conditions in at least one direction then there is a unique ground state given by all spins up , and the spin - bond mapping is 11 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dipolynomial @xmath31 has to be taken modulo @xmath32 ( spins @xmath33 and @xmath34 are identified ) , and , since @xmath35 , the propagation described above stops at the @xmath21th row . for this case eq.([b3 ] ) can be inverted : the spin at site @xmath36 is given by the superposition of the pts of all the defects @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40    equation ( [ s3 ] ) is analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "an important difference is that , while for the 1d ising and square plaquette models a spin in the bulk is the product of @xmath41 defects , for the triangular model it is given the product of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the fractal dimension of the pt .",
    "similar considerations apply to the higher dimensional models .",
    "consider now the symmetries of @xmath44 .",
    "suppose a whole row of spins is inverted .",
    "none of the bonds below that row is affected since pairs of spins on the row interact with spins in the next one . to leave the bonds immediately above unchanged",
    "it is necessary to invert every other spin in the preceding row .",
    "as one goes up the situation becomes more complicated , but eventually it can be seen that if one inverts two pts of spins , as shown in fig .  2",
    ", @xmath44 remains invariant . the choice of the initial row of flipped spins and the column from which the pts stem is arbitrary , as is the orientation of the transformation , which can be in the three symmetry directions of the problem .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath45 transformations .",
    "however , a bit of algebra with binomial coefficients shows that there are at most @xmath46 independent symmetry operations .",
    "first , by combining transformations in two of the symmetry directions , say @xmath47 and @xmath48 , gives a transformation in the third direction , @xmath49 .",
    "second , only the choice of row is free , since the central column can be shifted by superposition of transformations in different rows .",
    "the number of symmetries has to be the same as the number of ground state configurations . by looking at the cycles of the operator @xmath50",
    "@xcite it can be shown that in general there are at most @xmath51 ground states .",
    "for the special case of periodic boundary conditions of length a power of two , for which the ground state is unique , it is not difficult to prove that any transformation like that of fig .",
    "2 ` wraps ' around on itself and becomes trivial . in that case",
    "@xmath44 has no exact symmetries .",
    "once again , the symmetries of @xmath44 are a complicated analogue of the ones in the 1d ising model , which simply has the global inversion symmetry , and the square plaquette model , where @xmath52 is left invariant by the inversion of any row or column . in both these cases they are exact symmetries only for periodic or free boundary conditions .",
    "with the information of the two previous sections it becomes easy to calculate the static properties of the models .",
    "if for each case the boundary conditions are chosen such that the spin - defect mapping is one to one , the bonds are noninteracting and the partition function is simply that of a system of @xmath53 free ising excitations , @xmath54 .",
    "now , for both the 1d ising model and the square plaquette model , we know from exact diagonalization of their transfer matrices @xcite that for arbitrary boundary conditions the partition function per site in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath55 in the case of the triangular model , for linear size @xmath56 with periodic boundary conditions , the row - to - row transfer matrix has a single nonzero eigenvalue equal to @xmath57 . for arbitrary boundary conditions",
    "it can be checked by numerical diagonalization that the largest eigenvalue is still @xmath57 , so that in the thermodynamic limit the partition function per site is given by ( [ kappa ] ) irrespective of the boundaries .",
    "probably this can be proved using the exact methods of @xcite .",
    "similar evidence suggests that for the higher dimensional models eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) holds too .",
    "the expectation value of bonds is @xmath58 and the equilibrium energy density is , up to constants , just the concentration @xmath59 of defects @xmath60\\ ] ] using eqs .",
    "( [ b1])([b3 ] ) all spin correlation functions can be calculated . since in all models",
    "a spin in the bulk is the product @xmath61 bonds ( the precise power depending on the model ) , in the limit of @xmath62 , one obtains @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , i.e. , all models are disordered at any finite temperature .",
    "arbitrary correlation functions are computed in a similar manner @xmath65",
    "^{{\\cal n}_{i \\cdots j}}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the number of bonds which enter in the definition of the product of spins @xmath67 .",
    "only operators for which @xmath66 is finite in the thermodynamic limit have non - vanishing expectation values .",
    "as usual the 1d ising model is the simplest , the product of two spins @xmath68 corresponds to the product of all the bonds in between , giving the usual exponential decay of correlations with separation . in the square plaquette model",
    "all two and three point spin correlations vanish .",
    "the first nontrivial correlations are for quartets of spins in the vertices of rectangles , which corresponds to the product of all enclosed bonds .    in the case of the triangular plaquette model the simplest non - vanishing correlations are for",
    "triplets of spins located at the vertices of downward pointing equilateral triangles of side @xmath69 , which is given by the product of all the enclosed defects which also belong to the corresponding pt , @xmath70^{3^k}\\ ] ] notice the exact scaling relation @xmath71^{l^{d_f}}$ ] .",
    "the fact that most of the correlation functions are zero is a consequence of the multiple symmetries of these models and that there is no symmetry breaking in the thermodynamics : only spin products which are invariant under _ all _ the symmetry operations can have nonzero correlations .",
    "while the statics of the class of models being discussed here is trivial their dynamics is not . under a single spin - flip dynamics like glauber or metropolis all of these models , except ,",
    "of course , the 1d ising , become dynamically arrested due to the appearance of energy barriers to the relaxation .    consider the case of the triangular model .",
    "a single - spin flip corresponds to flipping the three bond variables around it , see fig.3a .",
    "this means that an isolated defect is locally stable since any change in the spins around it creates a new pair of defects and thus increases the energy .",
    "moreover , only pairs of defects at a distance @xmath72 can be relaxed by means of local spin moves , and the energy barrier is @xmath73 ( where we have set @xmath74 ) , see fig .  3b .",
    "as the system relaxes it has to cross barriers which grow as the logarithm of the size of equilibrating regions .",
    "= 3.5 in    from the observation that barriers grow logarithmically it is straightforward to estimate the equilibration time .",
    "the rate of relaxation of an excitation of linear size @xmath75 is given by the arrhenius formula @xmath76 .",
    "thus , after time @xmath77 the average linear distance between defects is @xmath78 .",
    "the equilibrium value of this distance at low @xmath79 is @xmath80 , and hence the equilibration time is @xmath81 this supra - arrhenius form is known as bssler equation @xcite and corresponds to fragile behaviour in the classification of angell @xcite .",
    "the absence of any finite temperature singularity is consistent with the fact that model has no finite - temperature phase transition .",
    "the existence of a hierarchy of energy barriers implies that the dynamics takes places in stages corresponding to the relaxation of a typical lengthscale at each stage .",
    "this is clearly seen in the decay of the concentration of defects after a quench from @xmath82 to a low temperature , fig .",
    "after an initial @xmath79-independent exponential relaxation corresponding to the ( barrierless ) removal of pairs of neighbouring defects , the concentration displays `` plateaus '' , which are more pronounced the lower the temperature .",
    "these plateaus are the result of the system becoming trapped in locally stable configurations , and correspond to the different stages of the dynamics .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of the triangular plaquette model is almost identical to that of the asymmetrically constrained ising chain ( or east model ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the typical distance between defects ( and its the whole distribution ) at each stage of the dynamics can be computed approximately using the independent interval method of ref .",
    "4b shows that the agreement between theory and simulations is reasonably good @xcite .",
    "this means that in terms of the defect variables , the dynamics if effectively constrained as in the east model .",
    "the existence of a dual description in terms of interacting spins with standard dynamics and in terms of free defects subject to effective kinetic constraints makes this model an explicit realization of the constrained dynamics scenario @xcite .",
    "= 6.0 in    the dynamics of the square plaquette model is somewhat simpler , although still activated .",
    "since a pair of neighbouring defects can diffuse freely , isolated excitations only face barriers of constant size .",
    "its glassy dynamics is strong , like the fredrickson - andersen model @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the defects is effectively given by the constrained lattice models of covalent networks of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the generalization to three dimensions of the triangular model is that of spins on an fcc lattice interacting with 4spin interactions between nearest ",
    "neighbours on the corners of downward pointing tetrahedra .",
    "the energy barrier to the relaxation of excitations at a distance @xmath69 is in this case @xmath83 . in this model",
    "there are zero energy moves when two defects are next to each other , but , in contrast to the square model , these are not diffusive since every pair belongs only to one plaquette .",
    "the relaxation time is of the bssler form , @xmath84 , and the behaviour is again fragile .",
    "4c shows the decay of the concentration of defects after a quench to low temperatures .",
    "notice that the length of the plateaus is now of two units of rescaled time @xmath85 .",
    "the symmetry considerations of the previous sections also apply to the dynamics .",
    "since the evolution operator has the same symmetries as the hamiltonian , dynamical expectation values of non - symmetric operators will vanish if the initial configuration is taken from a distribution which is also invariant , irrespective of whether the system is in equilibrium or not , as in the out of equilibrium regime after a quench from an initial infinite temperature state .",
    "this can be illustrated with the triangular model .",
    "5a and 5b show that all two  point spin correlations functions vanish at all times after the quench , while the invariant combination of triplets of spins in downward triangles of length a power of two has a nontrivial behaviour in time .",
    "5b also shows how the stages of the dynamics correspond to the relaxation of regions of size @xmath69 .",
