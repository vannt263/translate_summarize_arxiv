    "so far the most sophisticated study of dynamical tides in giant planets is that by ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) ( see also goodman & lackner 2009 ; ogilvie 2009,2013 ) , who focused on the tidal forcing of inertial waves ( short - wavelength disturbances restored primarily by coriolis force ) in the convective envelope of a rotating planet [ see ivanov & papaloizou ( 2007 ) and papaloizou & ivanov ( 2010 ) for highly eccentric orbits , and wu ( 2005 ) for a different approach ] .",

    "recent works have focused on mechanisms of dissipation in the planet s fluid envelope , but it is not clear whether they are adequate to satisfy the constraints from the solar system gas giants and the formation of close - in exoplanetary systems via high-@xmath3 migration .    in this paper , we have studied the possibility of tidal dissipation in the solid cores of giant planets .",
    "we have presented a general framework by which the effects of tidal dissipation on the spin and orbital evolution of planetary systems can be computed .",
    "this requires only one input - the imaginary part of the complex tidal love number , @xmath155 $ ] , as a function of the forcing frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we discussed the simplest model of tidal response in solids - the maxwell viscoelastic model , which is characterized by a transition frequency @xmath156 , above which the solid responds elastically , below - viscously . using the maxwell model for the rocky / icy core , and including the effect of a non - dissipative fluid envelope , we have demonstrated that with a modest - sized rocky core and reasonable ( but uncertain ) physical core parameters , tidal dissipation in the core can account for the jupiter - io tidal-@xmath23 constraint ( remus et al .",
    "2012 ) and at the same time allows exoplanetary hot jupiters to form via tidal circularization in the high-@xmath3 migration scenario .",
    "by contrast , in the often - used weak friction theory of equilibrium tide , when the tidal lag is calibrated with the jupiter - io constraint , hot jupiters would not be able to go through high-@xmath3 migration within the lifetime of their host stars .",
    "we have also examined the consequence of tidal heating in the rocky cores of giant planets .",
    "such heating can lead to modest radius inflation of the planets , particularly when the planets are in the high - eccentricity phase ( @xmath2 ) during their high-@xmath3 migration .    as an interesting by - product of our study",
    ", we have shown that when @xmath157 exhibits nontrivial dependence on @xmath1 ( as opposed to the linear dependence in the weak friction theory ) , there may exist multiple spin frequencies at which the torque on the planet vanishes ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we emphasize that there remain large uncertainties in the physical properties of solid cores inside giant planets , including the size , density , composition , viscosity and elastic shear modulus .",
    "these uncertainties make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusion about the importance of core dissipation .",
    "nevertheless , our study in this paper suggests that within the range of uncertainties , viscoelastic dissipation in the core is a possible mechanism of tidal dissipation in giant planets and has several desirable features when confronting the current observational constraints .",
    "thus , core dissipation should be kept in mind as observations in the coming years provide more data on tidal dissipations in giant planets .",
    "in the weak friction theory , the tidal love number @xmath158 is a linear function of the tidal frequency @xmath1 , and thus spin equilibrium ( @xmath136 ) occurs at a unique value of @xmath40 , termed the pseudosynchronous frequency , for a given orbital eccentricity @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath159 depends on @xmath1 in a more general way , as in the case of viscoelastic tidal models of giant planets , it is possible that multiple solutions for the equilibrium spin frequency @xmath160 exist at a given @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for the existence of multiple pseudo - synchronized spins can be understood in simple algebraic terms . for clarity here we demonstrate how multiple roots arise naturally even at low eccentricities .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ torque ] ) , which we rewrite here to make the dependence on spin frequency explicit : @xmath161 ^ 2 \\mathrm{im}[{\\tilde k}_2(n\\omega - m\\omega_s)].\\ ] ] for very low eccentricities @xmath162 , the hansen coefficients @xmath163 are negligible for all except the following combinations of @xmath164 : @xmath165 , @xmath166,@xmath167 , and @xmath168 .",
    "we can then rewrite @xmath169 as @xmath170,\\ ] ] with @xmath171 and @xmath172 real constants . plugging in for @xmath117",
    "using the maxwell model ( eq .  [ eq : k2maxwell ] ) ( neglecting fluid envelope for simplicity ) , we have : @xmath173 where @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 are constants .",
    "thus , when solving for @xmath40 from @xmath177 , it is obvious that upon finding the least common denominator , we end up solving a cubic equation for @xmath40 .",
    "the above discussion can be generalized to higher eccentricities : the pseudosynchronized spin @xmath160 is determined by solving equations of increasingly higher ( always odd ) degree in @xmath40 .",
    "the top panel of figure a2 shows the two terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ toytz ] ) , as well as their sum , for the viscoelastic model 4 of figure a1 at an eccentricity of @xmath178 .",
    "this demonstrates the way in which multiple solutions for @xmath179 arise .",
    "furthermore , we see that two ( out of three ) of the solutions are resonant in nature : that is , they occur , roughly , at multiples of @xmath180 , where @xmath41 is the orbital frequency . this can be understood by considering that the viscoelastic response ( figure a1 ) is quite sharply peaked and localized .",
    "each term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ toytz ] ) vanishes when @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively . due to the sharply peaked nature of the viscoelastic response , to which @xmath169 is proportional",
    ", the sum of the two terms then shows resonant crossings at both of these values .",
    "this generalizes easily to the case of arbitrary eccentricity , where each @xmath164 harmonic of the sum for @xmath169 ( eq .",
    "a1 ) vanishes when @xmath183 .",
    "the number and location of the resonant crossings then depends on the relative importance of each of the harmonics ; the strongest crossing is expected to occur @xmath184 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure a2 ( bottom ) and figure a3 .",
    "thus , the nonlinearity of the function @xmath185 $ ] of the viscoelastic maxwell model is responsible for the existence of multiple pseudosynchronized spins .",
    "as shown in figure a2 ( bottom panel ) , there will not be multiple solutions if the viscoelastic response is not localized enough , compared with the mean motion frequency @xmath41 ( that is , the width of the resonant transition @xmath186 ) , and all important harmonics of @xmath169 are solidly on the viscous ( linear ) side of the maxwell curve . on the other hand , there may exist multiple solutions when @xmath187 and the relevant tidal forcing frequencies lie on the elastic side of the maxwell curve .    finally , we note that all the resonant zero crossings of @xmath169 are stable ( negative slope ) , while the non - resonant crossings are necessarily unstable ( positive slope ) .",
    "the innermost and outermost crossings are always resonant .",
    "this phenomenon is analogous to that discussed by makarov & efroimsky ( 2013 ) , who used a different model for viscoelastic dissipation in solid bodies to analyze the pseudosynchronization of telluric planets .",
    "they demonstrated the presence of multiple equilibrium spin solutions , and showed that only the resonant solutions are stable equilibria , thus concluding that the telluric planets possess no true ( non - resonant ) pseudosynchronous state .",
    "the implications of our finding may be of practical interest when it becomes possible to measure the spin of exoplanets on eccentric orbits .",
    "we may then look for evidence of the existence of multiple stable spin equilibria in rocky planets or gas giants with rocky cores .",
