    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) have been recognized as a new generation of ubiquitous computing systems to support a broad range of applications , including monitoring , health care and tracking environmental pollution levels .",
    "minimizing the total energy consumption in both circuit components and rf signal transmission is a crucial challenge in designing a wsn .",
    "central to this study is to find energy - efficient modulation and coding schemes in the physical layer of a wsn to prolong the sensor lifetime @xcite . for this purpose , energy - efficient modulation /",
    "coding schemes should be simple enough to be implemented by state - of - the - art low - power technology , but still robust enough to provide the desired service .",
    "furthermore , since sensor devices frequently switch from sleep mode to active mode , modulation and coding circuits should have fast start - up times @xcite along with the capability of transmitting packets during a pre - assigned time slot before new sensed packets arrive .",
    "in addition , a wsn needs a powerful channel coding scheme ( when the distance between nodes exceeds a certain threshold level ) to protect transmitted data against the unpredictable and harsh nature of channels .",
    "we refer to these low - complexity and low - energy consumption approaches in wsns providing proper link reliability as _ green modulation / coding _ ( gmc ) schemes .",
    "there have been several recent works on the energy efficiency of various modulation/ coding schemes in wsns ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite compare the power efficiency of ppm and fsk in a wsn over fading channels with path - loss without considering the effect of channel coding .",
    "reference @xcite investigates the energy efficiency of bch and convolutional codes with fsk for the optimal packet length in a point - to - point wsn .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that bch codes can improve energy efficiency compared to the convolutional code for the optimal fixed packet size .",
    "@xcite investigate the energy efficiency of uncoded fsk modulation in a wsn , where multiple senders transmit their data to a central node in a frequency - division multiple access ( fdma ) fashion .",
    "reference @xcite presents the hardware implementation of the forward error correction ( fec ) encoder in ieee 802.15.4 wsns , which employs parallel processing to achieve a low processing latency and energy consumption .",
    "most of the pioneering work on energy - efficient modulation / coding , including research in @xcite , has focused only on minimizing the energy consumption of transmitting one bit , ignoring the effect of bandwidth and transmission time duration . in a practical wsn however , it is shown that minimizing the total energy consumption depends strongly on the active mode duration and the channel bandwidth .",
    "references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite address this issue in a point - to - point wsn , where a sensor node transmits an equal amount of data per time unit to a designated sink node . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that uncoded mqam is more energy - efficient than uncoded mfsk for short - range applications , while using convolutional coded mfsk over awgn is desirable for longer distances .",
    "this line of work is further extended in @xcite by evaluating the energy consumption per information bit of a wsn for reed solomon ( rs ) codes and various modulation schemes over awgn channels with path - loss . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the authors do not consider the effect of multi - path fading .",
    "more recently , the attention of researchers has been drawn to deploying rateless codes ( e.g. , luby transform ( lt ) code @xcite ) in wsns due to the significant advantages of these codes in erasure channels .",
    "for instance in @xcite , the authors present a scheme for cooperative error control coding using rateless and low - density generator - matrix ( ldgm ) codes in a multiple relay wsn .",
    "however , investigating the energy efficiency of rateless codes in wsns with low - energy modulations over realistic fading channel models has received little attention . to the best of our knowledge , there is no existing analysis on the energy efficiency of rateless coded modulation that considers the effect of channel bandwidth and active mode duration on the total energy consumption in a proactive wsn .",
    "this paper addresses this issue and presents the first in - depth analysis of the energy efficiency of lt codes with fsk , known as green modulation as described in @xcite .",
    "the present analysis is based on a realistic model in proactive wsns operating over a rayleigh fading channel with path - loss .",
    "in addition , we obtain the probability mass function of the lt code rate and the corresponding coding gain , and study their effects on the energy efficiency of the wsn .",
    "this study uses the classical bch and convolutional codes ( as reference codes ) , utilized in ieee standards , for comparative evaluation .",
    "numerical results , supported by some experimental setup on the computation energy , show that the optimized lt coded fsk scheme is the most energy - efficient scheme for distance @xmath0 greater than the threshold level @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , although the optimized uncoded fsk outperforms coded schemes for @xmath2 , the energy gap between lt coded and uncoded fsk is negligible for @xmath2 compared to the other coded schemes .",
    "this result comes from the simplicity and flexibility of the lt codes , and suggests that lt codes are beneficial in practical low - power wsns with dynamic position sensor nodes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ system_model ] , the proactive system model over a realistic wireless channel is described .",
    "the energy consumption of both circuits and signal transmission of uncoded mfsk modulation is analyzed in section [ uncoded_mfsk ] .",
    "design of lt codes and the energy efficiency of the lt coded mfsk are presented in section [ analysis_ch4 ] .",
    "section [ simulation_ch5 ] provides some numerical evaluations using some classical channel codes as well as realistic models to confirm our analysis .",
    "also , some design guidelines for using lt codes in practical wsn applications are presented .",
    "finally in section [ conclusion_ch6 ] , an overview of the results and conclusions are presented .",
    "for convenience , we provide a list of key mathematical symbols used in this paper in table i. for simplicity of notation , we use the superscripts ` bc ' , ` cc ' and ` lt ' for bch , convolutional and lt codes , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for energy , power and time parameters , respectively .",
    "also , we use the subscript `` @xmath6 '' to distinguish coding parameters from the uncoded ones .",
    "[ table234 ]    .list of notations [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : coded_uncoded ] shows the total energy consumption versus distance @xmath0 for the optimized bch , convolutional and lt coded mfsk schemes , compared to the optimized uncoded mfsk for @xmath7 .",
    "the optimization is done over @xmath8 and the parameters of coding scheme .",
    "simulation results show that for @xmath0 less than the threshold level @xmath9 m , the total energy consumption of optimized uncoded mfsk is less than that of the coded mfsk schemes .",
    "however , the energy gap between lt coded and uncoded mfsk is negligible compared to the other coded schemes as expected . for @xmath10 , the lt coded mfsk scheme is more energy - efficient than uncoded and other coded mfsk schemes .",
    "also , it is observed that the energy gap between lt and convolutional coded mfsk increases when the distance @xmath0 grows .",
    "this result comes from the high coding gain capability of lt codes which confirms our analysis in section [ analysis_ch4 ] .",
    "the threshold level @xmath1 ( for lt code ) or @xmath11 ( for bch and convolutional codes ) are obtained when the total energy consumptions of coded and uncoded systems become equal .",
    "for instance , using @xmath12 , and the equality between ( [ energy_totfsk ] ) and ( [ energy_totalcodedfsk ] ) for uncoded and convolutional coded mfsk , we have @xmath13^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}},\\ ] ] where @xmath14\\\\ & \\times&\\dfrac{\\mathcal{l}_1 m_l}{\\log_2 m}\\dfrac{n n_0}{\\omega},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath15 @xmath16    it should be noted that the above threshold level imposes a constraint on the design of the physical layer of some wireless sensor networking applications , in particular dynamic wsns . to obtain more insight into this issue , let",
    "assume that the location of the sensor node is changed every @xmath17 time unit , where @xmath18 is the channel coherence time .",
    "for the moment , let us assume that the sensor node aims to choose either a _ fixed - rate coded _ or an uncoded mfsk based on the distance between sensor and sink nodes . according to the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : coded_uncoded ] , it is revealed that using fixed - rate channel coding is not energy efficient for short distance transmission ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) , while for @xmath20 , convolutional coded mfsk is more energy - efficient than other schemes . for this configuration , the sensor node must have the capability of an adaptive coding scheme for each distance @xmath0 .",
    "however , as discussed previously , the lt codes can adjust their rates for each channel condition and have ( with a good approximation ) minimum energy consumption for every distance @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that lt codes can surpass the above distance constraint for wsn applications with dynamic position sensor nodes over rayleigh fading channels .",
    "this characteristic of lt codes results in reducing the complexity of the network design as well . of interest is the strong benefits of using lt coded mfsk compared with the coded modulation schemes in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical fixed - rate codes used in @xcite , the lt codes can vary their block lengths to adapt to any channel condition in each distance @xmath0 . unlike @xcite and @xcite , where the authors consider fixed - rate codes over an awgn channel model",
    ", we considered a rayleigh fading channel which is a general model in practical wsns .",
    "the simplicity and flexibility advantages of lt codes with an mfsk scheme make them the preferable choice for wireless sensor networks , in particular for wsns with dynamic position sensor nodes .",
    "* remark 1 : * as discussed previously , the proposed lt coded scheme benefits in adjusting the coding parameters in each channel realization or equivalently each distance @xmath0 to minimize the total energy consumption .",
    "as we will show shortly , this comes from a variable transmission time process which adaptively controls the power consumption of the proposed scheme . to address this issue , we plot the active mode duration of the optimized lt coded modulation versus @xmath0 compared to those of the optimized uncoded and other coded modulation schemes in fig . [ fig : active ] . for this purpose , we use @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the active mode duration of uncoded scheme .",
    "simulation results show that the optimum constellation size @xmath8 that minimizes the total energy consumption for the aforementioned schemes and for every value of distance @xmath0 is @xmath23 .",
    "it is revealed from fig .",
    "[ fig : active ] that the optimized uncoded and convolutional coded mfsk display fixed values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for every value of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we can see that for @xmath26 m and @xmath27 m , @xmath28 is less than @xmath29 and @xmath25 , respectively . using ( [ total_energy1 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : coded_uncoded ] , and noting that the total energy consumption of a certain scheme is proportional to the transmission time , it is concluded that the scheme with a lower transmission time is not necessarily more energy efficient than that of the scheme with greater @xmath24 .    * remark 2 : * to make a fair comparison between uncoded and coded schemes , one would expect to assume a constant active mode duration for all the communication schemes . according to @xmath21 with @xmath22 , this",
    "is achieved by adjusting the modulation order @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the assumption of the same transmission times for all the schemes is not a realistic assumption in feasible wsns where `` autonomous '' sensor devices are powered by limited - lifetime batteries .",
    "more precisely , under the assumption of the same @xmath24 ( or @xmath30 ) , the wireless sensor network needs an extra hardware to adjust the constellation size @xmath8 ( in each distance @xmath0 ) , which imposes more cost , complexity and power consumption in the network . while , our scheme with variable transmission times surpasses the above adaptive modulation constraint using the fact that the optimum constellation size @xmath8 which minimizes the total energy consumption ( in each distance @xmath0 ) is @xmath23",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the energy efficiency of lt coded mfsk in a proactive wsn over rayleigh fading channels with path - loss .",
    "it was shown that the energy efficiency of lt codes is similar to that of uncoded mfsk scheme for @xmath31 , while for @xmath32 , lt coded mfsk outperforms other uncoded and coded schemes , from the energy efficiency point of view .",
    "this result follows from the flexibility of the lt code to adjust its rate and the corresponding lt coding gain to suit instantaneous channel conditions for any transmission distance @xmath0 .",
    "this rate flexibility offers strong benefits in using lt codes in practical wsns with dynamic distance and position sensors . in such systems and for every value of distance @xmath0",
    ", lt codes can adjust their rates to achieve a certain ber with low energy consumption .",
    "the importance of our scheme is that it avoids some of the problems inherent in adaptive coding or incremental redundancy ( ir ) systems ( channel feedback , large buffers , or multiple decodings ) , as well as the coding design challenge for fixed - rate codes used in wsns with dynamic position sensor nodes .",
    "the simplicity and flexibility advantages of lt codes make the lt code with mfsk modulation can be considered as a _ green modulation / coding _ ( gmc ) scheme in dynamic wsns .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown the significant benefit of rateless codes ( with focus on the optimized lt codes ) for sensor networks over the more traditional fixed - rate codes .",
    "our future research involves selecting the best rate - adaptive code among lt , raptor , punctured ldpc , and punctured turbo codes ; in particular , we are interested to study the performance of the raptor code which has a linear - time encoding versus the non - linear cost of the lt code . for this study ,",
    "a particularly nice feature of the lt code is to rapidly optimize the code using a modified exit chart strategy introduced in @xcite .",
    "the proof of the remark is straightforward using the notation of @xcite and the bipartite graph concepts in graph theory .",
    "obviously , the output - node degree distribution @xmath33 induces a distribution on the input nodes in the bipartite graph .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic case of @xmath34 , we have the input - node degree distribution defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the probability that an input node has a degree @xmath37 . in this case , the average degree of the input and output nodes are computed as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . thus , the number of edges exiting the input nodes of the bipartite graph , in the asymptotic case of @xmath34 , is @xmath40 , which must be equal to @xmath41 , the number of edges entering the output nodes in the graph . as a results ,",
    "the asymptotic lt code rate is obtained as @xmath42 , which is a deterministic value for given @xmath33 and @xmath43 .",
