    "similar to the relevant role of the q-@xmath8 potential for meson properties , the three - quark ( 3q ) potential @xcite is directly responsible to the structure and properties of baryons . in spite of the importance of the 3q potential in the hadron physics",
    ", there were only a few preliminary lattice - qcd studies for the 3q potential done in 80 s @xcite .",
    "the 3q ground - state potential @xmath0 can be measured in a gauge - invariant manner using the 3q wilson loop @xmath11 as shown in fig.1 , @xmath12 similar to the derivation of the q-@xmath13 potential from the wilson loop . in principle , @xmath0 can be obtained in the large @xmath14 limit , however , the practical lattice - qcd calculation of @xmath15 becomes severe for large @xmath14 , because @xmath15 decreases exponentially with @xmath14 .",
    "physically , the true ground state of the 3q system is expected to consist of three flux tubes , and the 3q state expressed by the three strings generally includes many excited - state components such as flux - tube vibrational modes .",
    "therefore , for the accurate measurement of the 3q ground - state potential @xmath0 , the ground - state enhancement or the excitation - component reduction by the smearing technique @xcite is practically indispensable .",
    "( this smearing was not applied in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in this paper , we study the 3q ground - state potential @xmath0 using the ground - state enhancement by the gauge - covariant smearing technique for the link - variable in the su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd with the standard action with @xmath16=5.7 ( @xmath17 0.19fm ) and @xmath18 24 at the quenched level @xcite .",
    "we consider 16 patterns of the 3q configuration where the three quarks are put on @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 in @xmath22 with @xmath23 in the lattice unit .",
    "the junction point @xmath24 , which does not affect @xmath0 , is set at the origin @xmath25 in @xmath22 .",
    "the smearing technique is actually successful for accurate measurements of the q-@xmath8 potential in the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the standard smearing for link - variables is performed by the iterative replacement of the spatial link - variable @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) by the obscured link - variable @xmath28 @xcite which maximizes @xmath29 \\right\\ } , \\quad u_{-\\mu}(s ) \\equiv u_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}(s-\\hat \\mu ) ,   \\ ] ] with a real smearing parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31-th smeared link - variable @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33    as an important feature , this smearing procedure keeps the gauge covariance of the smeared link - variable @xmath32 properly .",
    "in fact , the gauge - transformation property of @xmath32 is just the same as that of the original link - variable @xmath34 , and therefore the gauge invariance of @xmath35 is ensured whenever @xmath36 is gauge invariant .",
    "since the smeared link - variable @xmath32 includes a spatial extension , the `` line '' expressed with @xmath32 physically corresponds to a `` flux tube '' with a spatial extension .",
    "therefore , if a suitable smearing is done , the `` line '' of the smeared link - variable is expected to be close to the ground - state flux tube . here , the overlap between the ground - state operator and the 3q - state operator at @xmath37 in the 3q wilson loop @xmath11 is estimated by @xmath38.\\ ] ] to get the ground - state - dominant 3q system , we investigate the ground - state overlap @xmath39 for the 3q wilson loop composed of the smeared link - variable @xmath32 in the lattice qcd , and we adopt the smearing with @xmath40 and the iteration number @xmath41 , which largely enhances @xmath39 for all of the 3q configurations in consideration as shown in fig.2 .",
    "in this section , we consider the potential form of @xmath0 based on qcd . in the short - distance limit , the perturbative qcd is applicable and the coulomb - type potential appears as the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) result . in the long - distance limit at the quenched level , the flux - tube picture would be applicable from the argument of the strong - coupling qcd @xcite , and hence a linear - type confinement potential is expected to appear .",
    "actually , the q-@xmath42 potential @xmath43 is well reproduced by the coulomb - plus - linear potential in the lattice qcd .",
    "then , we conjecture that the 3q ground - state potential @xmath0 is also expressed by a sum of the short - distance oge result and the long - distance flux - tube result as @xmath44 where @xmath7 denotes the minimal length of the total flux tubes linking the three quarks .",
    "next , we consider the diquark limit , where the 3q system becomes equivalent to a q-@xmath42 system , which leads to a physical requirement on the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath43 . here , the constant term is to be considered carefully , because there appears a divergence from the coulomb term in @xmath0 as @xmath45 in the continuum diquark limit . in the lattice regularization ,",
    "this ultraviolet divergence is regularized to be a finite constant with the lattice spacing @xmath46 as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a dimensionless constant satisfying @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we get the diquark - limit requirement on the lattice , @xmath51",
    "we measure the 3q ground - state potential @xmath0 from 210 gauge configurations in the su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd using the smearing technique , and compare the lattice data with the theoretical form of eq.(5 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the best fit coefficients in @xmath0 and @xmath43 in eq.(5 ) .",
    "table 2 shows the comparison between the lattice qcd data @xmath52 and the fitting function @xmath53 in eq.(5 ) with the three coefficients listed in table 1 .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the three - quark ground - state potential @xmath0 is well described by eq.(5 ) with accuracy better than a few % . from table 1 , we find a universal feature of the string tension , @xmath54 , as well as the oge result for the coulomb coefficient , @xmath55 .",
    "all the diquark - limit requirements in eq.(6 ) are satisfied for @xmath56 .",
    "another fitting with the @xmath57-type flux - tube ansatz @xcite seems rather worse , because of unacceptably large @xmath58 .",
    "however , as an approximation , @xmath0 seems described by a simple sum of an effective two - body q - q potential with a reduced string tension as @xmath59 .",
    "this reduction factor can be naturally understood as a geometrical factor rather than the color factor , since the ratio between @xmath7 and the perimeter length @xmath60 satisfies @xmath61 , which leads to @xmath62 with @xmath63 .    .",
