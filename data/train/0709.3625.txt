    "in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , the quasi - free charge carriers of a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) condense in equidistant and numerously degenerated landau levels @xcite .",
    "variations of the electrostatic potential locally shift the degeneracy and , therefore , cause the formation of landau bands .",
    "the bending of the landau dispersion at the edge of a 2des is discussed thoroughly in the literature @xcite as it is the key for the understanding of the quantum hall effect @xcite . if the lateral extension of a 2des is limited electrostatically or by the physical edge of the underlying ( lithographically defined ) structure , the landau bands rise on a length scale which substantially exceeds the magnetic length . however",
    ", if the confining barrier is fabricated by means of epitaxy , namely , by the technique of cleaved - edge overgrowth @xcite , the realization of a sharp edge potential becomes possible .",
    "the corresponding edge channels are then located at distances on the order of the magnetic length @xcite .    in this paper , we report on the magnetotunneling spectroscopy between two quantum hall systems which are separated by an atomically precise potential barrier within a gaas / algaas heterostructure",
    ". the width of the barrier amounts to  , i.e.  it falls always below the magnetic length . in the vicinity of the barrier , a complex landau band structure exists which can be described in the case of weak coupling as a superposition of the mirror - inverted dispersions of both subsystems .",
    "the degeneracy at the crossings is lifted by small landau band gaps @xcite .",
    "the tunneling current through the structure becomes maximum when the fermi level coincides with one of these anticrossings @xcite .",
    "the conductance is additionally determined by random tunneling centers in the barrier which are responsible for quantum interferences between opposite edge channels @xcite .",

    "[ fig : intro]a , a former experiment by kang .  is based on modulation - doped electron films @xcite .",
    "a fixed electron density implies that a certain landau band gap coincides with the fermi level only for a small range of the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , a sample design with a gate electrode allows to investigate a particular band gap at different magnetic fields provided that the fermi level is adjusted in a suitable way . in order to probe the same anticrossing for different barrier widths ,",
    "it is , therefore , not necessary to prepare several samples as the effective shape of the barrier ( in units of the magnetic length  @xmath0 and the cyclotron energy  @xmath1 ) can simply be varied by the magnetic field .",
    "carrying out measurements for different electron densities with the same sample is also indispensable if quantum interferences are investigated which depend on the random configuration of tunneling centers within the barrier .",
    "another effect can be observed just with a single sample , namely , the small magnetic shift of the landau band gaps on the scale of the cyclotron energy which would otherwise be perturbed by the unavoidable fluctuations between successive growth processes .",
    "all effects discussed in this paper depend basically on the shape of the landau band structure at the tunneling barrier ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]b ) . for weakly coupled electron systems , ho has calculated the energy dispersion by using an approximation approach @xcite . though the result reflects the actual dispersion very well ,",
    "the gap positions differ noticeably from the findings of a complete quantum mechanical calculation if a fine energy resolution is relevant as for our experiment @xcite . instead of combining the dispersions of both subsystems , takagaki and ploog",
    "have developed a tight - binding model which is not only applicable for weakly , but also for strongly coupled electron systems @xcite .",
    "the tunneling barrier is thereby represented by a reduced hopping amplitude between two simulation grid lines . since the effective shape of the barrier is not explicitly considered in this model ,",
    "the latter is inappropriate to make accurate predictions on the gap position in dependence of the magnetic field .",
    "the landau dispersion which is necessary for the interpretation of the obtained experimental data has been calculated exactly by solving the single - electron schrdinger equation . since the potential term in the hamiltonian is given by a superposition of the parabolic magnetic confinement potential and the piecewise constant conduction band offset of the intrinsic semiconductor heterostructure , the problem is generally closely related to the linear quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "the analytic solution becomes possible with an ansatz for the wave function which is composed of parabolic cylinder functions . for calculating the energy eigenstates ,",
    "we have developed a dedicated algorithm which numerically solves the continuity conditions at the heterojunctions .",
    "it is generally applicable to all systems which consist of up to three regions of constant potential .",
    "hence , this method yields the landau dispersion for systems with either a rectangular barrier ( biased or not ) or a potential well ( quantum wire ) @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : the sample structure and the corresponding landau dispersion are introduced in the next two sections .",
    "the subject of sec .",
    "[ sec : tun ] consists of two different tunneling models which are the basis for the understanding of the landau oscillations and simultaneously occurring conductance fluctuations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] we discuss a method for determining the electron density from magnetotunneling measurements .",

    "[ sec : ll - osci ] where the focus lies on the magnetic shift of the anticrossings .",
    "section  [ sec : ab ] deals with aharonov - bohm oscillations at the first conductance peak on the scale of the filling factor .",
    "conductance fluctuations which appear at low magnetic fields are finally discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluct_low ] .",
    "for a quantitative investigation of the energy dispersion in dependence of the magnetic field , it is necessary to have both a well - defined tunneling barrier and electron systems of variable density .",
    "the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) allows the fabrication of gaas / algaas interfaces with a roughness which is as low as one monolayer . for low - dimensional quantum systems like ours ,",
    "one commonly needs a sharp potential modulation not just in one , but in two directions of space . for this purpose ,",
    "pfeiffer .  have developed the cleaved - edge overgrowth ( ceo ) method which allows to grow subsequently two layer sequences at right angles to another @xcite . with this technique ,",
    "the sample structure of fig .  [ fig : intro]a can be realized .",
    "it contains two laterally adjacent electron systems which reside in the layers of the first growth step and are induced by means of a gate electrode which is fabricated during the second mbe step .",
    "the source and drain contacts of the heterostructure consist of gaas layers which are silicon - doped to 217@xmath2 with thicknesses of 500 and 1100@xmath3 nm , respectively .",
    "the quantum region is composed of a @xmath4 thick @xmath5 barrier and two embedding layers of intrinsic gaas ( each 2 m ) .",
    "after the first growth step , the wafer is discharged from the mbe machine and chemically polished to a thickness of 80 to @xmath6 by means of a bromine methanol solution .",
    "the wafer is then cleaved into small pieces which are scratched at a certain position and transferred into the growth chamber again . immediately after breaking the samples _ in - situ _ , the freshly exposed cleavage planes are overgrown with @xmath7 of @xmath8 .",
    "the barrier region is followed by a @xmath9 thick layer of @xmath10-gaas with an electron density of 218@xmath2 .",
    "it acts as the gate electrode . by etching a mesa ,",
    "the buried source contact is exposed .",
    "the samples are divided into stripes where each piece contains a @xmath11 long section of the cleavage plane .",
    "ohmic contacts on the @xmath10-layers are realized with indium droplets .",
    "these are deposited by a soldering iron and subsequently alloyed into the crystal at about 360@xmath12c .",
    "if the active region of a ceo sample is accessed via @xmath10-layers of the ( 001 ) growth step , the occurrence of bulk leakage currents is generally possible @xcite . in the case of our structure ,",
    "the leakage current flows apart from the coupled electron systems through the 4 m thick intrinsic region . in the ( 001 ) cross - section of the heterostructure , the induced 2dess account only for about 1/100,000 of the total area . in order to prevent that conductance oscillations in the quantum region can not be measured against the background of the bulk leakage current",
    ", the aluminum content in the tunneling barrier has to be sufficiently high .",
    "thus the sample design of fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]a allows only landau band gaps which are considerably smaller than the cyclotron energy . since for such a dispersion the number of opposite edge states with significant overlap is small in comparison to the low - barrier case which is exemplarily shown in fig .  [ fig : intro]b , this coupling regime is denoted here as weak  independently from the absolute tunneling resistance .",
    "the quality of the indium contacts and of the tunneling barrier is revealed by the two - point i - v - curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : curves]a : both pairs of junctions on the source and drain contact layers show a perfect ohmic behavior .",
    "the ratio of their reciprocal resistance coincides with the thickness ratio of the underlying @xmath10-contact layers . according to the @xmath13-@xmath14 curve d@xmath15s , which represents the leakage current between source and drain for a vanishing gate voltage , the bulk resistance amounts at least @xmath16 for applied voltages below  @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , magnetotransport measurements can be carried out with ac voltages which are small enough so that the bulk resistance always exceeds the resistance of the induced electron systems .",
    "the magnetotransport properties of the quantum region have been investigated by means of lock - in technique . the corresponding circuit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]a . in spite of the four - point contact geometry ,",
    "the active region is effectively accessible only via two leads , namely , the extended @xmath10-layers of the first growth step .",
    "this fact prevents a direct determination of the charge carrier density by standard methods like shubnikov - de haas or ( quantum ) hall measurements .",
    "the coupled electron systems have been studied by applying an ac voltage of @xmath18 via a high - impedance resistor @xmath19 .",
    "this setup ensures a practically constant current of @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : curves]b in dependence of the magnetic field bear some resemblance to the shubnikov - de haas effect . in the following ,",
    "the prominent long - period resistance oscillations are called _ landau oscillations _ as they originate from the periodic coincidence of the fermi level with the landau band gaps .",
    "other magnetotransport features are two different types of conductance fluctuations which appear respectively at low field strengths ( @xmath24 ) and in the range of the rightmost resistance minimum ( in fig .",

    "it is necessary to know the landau band structure at the tunneling barrier quantitatively .",
    "provided that the electrostatic potential of a two - dimensional hall system is constant , the energy levels of the charge carriers are given by the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "close to potential variations , the degeneracy of the landau levels is lifted so that they form dispersive bands .",
    "the particular landau bands increase monotonically for electrons approaching the confinement potential of a 2des @xcite . in the vicinity of a tunneling barrier",
    ", the landau dispersion shows an oscillating structure which is calculated in the following . with regard to the conduction band shape of the gaas / algaas / gaas heterostructure ,",
    "the treatment is restricted to electron systems which are unidirectionally modulated by three regions of constant potential .",
    "the uniform potential within each region makes a representation of the energy eigenfunctions by parabolic cylinder functions possible .",
    "besides , the constraint concerning the number of heterojunctions keeps the equation system which results from the continuity conditions solvable . for a system with a single potential discontinuity",
    ", one has to determine only the energy eigenvalue which can be done by means of a standard solution method .",
    "a sample structure with two heterojunctions already requires a dedicated solution algorithm for the simultaneous calculation of both the energy eigenvalue and a characteristic mixing parameter . for the analytic and numerical details we refer to refs .",

    "the schrdinger equation which describes the whole quantum region is solved in the scope of the effective mass approximation .",
    "for the gaas layers and the algaas barrier , we use the same effective mass @xmath26 .",
    "the aluminum content @xmath27 of the potential barrier corresponds to a conduction band offset of @xmath28 with respect to gaas @xcite . as the barrier height is a multiple of the cyclotron energy @xmath29 , the probability density for electrons at typical magnetic fields is very low inside the algaas material .",
    "consequently , the assumption of a constant effective mass throughout the whole structure is a rather good approximation . for strongly coupled electron systems , however ,",
    "the difference concerning both the cyclotron energy and the cyclotron radius becomes absolutely relevant  @xcite .",
    "if the conduction band offset is assumed to vary just along the @xmath30-axis , i.e.  in the direction of the first growth step , the schrdinger equation for a single electron subjected to a magnetic field reads @xmath31 for electrons propagating parallel to the tunneling barrier and perpendicular to @xmath32 , it is appropriate to use the landau gauge @xmath33 .",

    ", the variable  @xmath45 stands for the center of the skipping orbits of electrons propagating along a barrier .",
    "therefore , the parameter  @xmath45 is commonly called guiding center . while dispersion relations are generally plotted against the wavenumber  @xmath38 , the close connection between the guiding center and the actual location of the electron often gives reasons to use @xmath44 as the abscissa in plots of the landau band structure .",
    "this enables a direct comparison between the dispersion and the potential landscape even when @xmath45 substantially differs from the actual electron position .",

    "the term  @xmath46 may be neglected in eq .",

    "the formation of the landau oscillations is illustrated in figs .",

    "when the fermi level  @xmath84 increases and exceeds an integer value , two additional edge channels emerge at all sample edges as well as parallel to the tunneling barrier .",
    "however , if the fermi level increases further and enters one of the landau band gaps , two edge states disappear again at each anticrossing while the corresponding channels still exist at the other edges of the coupled quantum hall systems . from this reason and due to the fact that the chirality of the system suppresses backscattering into the contacts ,",
    "the electrons in the remaining parts of the edge channels are supposed to tunnel immediately through the endings of the barrier @xcite . if the fermi level lies between the @xmath76-th and @xmath85-th landau band ( @xmath36 , 1 , 2 ,  @xmath37 ) and if the system is spin - degenerate , this effect gives rise to a conductance of @xmath86 .",

    "we have presented a gaas / algaas heterostructure which contains two laterally adjacent , field - induced quantum hall systems which are separated by a thin , epitaxially grown barrier . the structure includes a gate electrode in order to allow a detailed analysis of the landau band structure at the line junction for different magnetic fields . for the interpretation of the experimental data ,",
    "the landau dispersion has been calculated exactly for non - interacting electrons residing in a 2des with a rectangular potential wall .",
    "the conductance traces in dependence of the magnetic field are dominated by so - called landau oscillations which occur due to the periodic coincidence of the fermi level with the landau band gaps .",
    "an observed enhancement of the conductance which exceeds the predictions according to the landauer - bttiker formalism is a consequence of macroscopic defects .",
    "the latter divide the long and narrow quantum region into multiple independent sections which are connected in parallel by the extended @xmath10-contact layers .",
    "our theory predicts for weakly coupled electron systems a magnetic shift of the anticrossings on the scale of the cyclotron energy of about @xmath257 .",
    "the experiment confirms this effect semiquantitatively by a displacement of the conductance peaks on the scale of the filling factor for an increasing fermi level .",
    "the conductance peak which corresponds to the gap between the first two landau bands is cropped and distorted by short- and long - period conductance fluctuations .",
    "the short - period feature is a result of the ab interference between counterpropagating edge channels along the barrier .",
    "the interference is made possible by tunneling centers which exist accidentally within the algaas barrier . for determining the distance of the involved tunneling centers from the fourier spectrum of the conductance traces ,",
    "it is necessary to know the distance of the interfering edge channels . by using the result of a band structure calculation",
    ", we obtain an average distance of the point contacts of about  2 m .",
    "the observed ab oscillations basically fulfill two coherence conditions which describe the influence of the electron temperature and the internal bias voltage , respectively .",
    "the bias results from gate leakage currents which lead to an offset between the two coupled electron systems .",
    "long - period conductance fluctuations at the first conductance peak are a consequence of the disorder potential which distorts the edge channel positions in an irregular way for a varying magnetic field .",
    "in addition to the interference effects at the cropped conductance peak , we observe conductance fluctuations which emerge at small magnetic fields and disappear at the onset of the regular landau oscillations . they occur in the regime of strong localization which is a consequence of an imperfect barrier .",
    "the latter represents a multiple slit interferometer which essentially reduces the number of transversal modes in the whole system .",
    "the phase coherence length determined from the conductance fluctuations , @xmath258 , is of the same order as @xmath246 which follows from the distance of the tunneling centers involved for the ab oscillations .",
