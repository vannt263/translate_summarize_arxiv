    "effect of substitution non magnetic impurity on a swcnt are investigated by many peoples @xcite .",
    "we found that by doping boron and nitrogen the semiconductor gap , @xmath0 , of a zigzag swcnt could be control@xcite .",
    "it is shown that vacancy could lead to electron spin polarization , hence a magnetic swcnt@xcite . but",
    "role of doping finite magnetic impurity concentration on a zigzag swcnt is not challenged .",
    "our motivation is to investigate possibility of a ferromagnetic semiconductor swcnt in comparison to the dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii model and treatment formalism of a magnetic impurity doped zigzag swcnt is introduced . in sec .",
    "iii three cases are considered : in the first case just impurity concentration is changed while impurity spin magnitude , exchange coupling and temperature are fixed .",
    "we found for the weak exchange coupling , @xmath1 , by increasing impurity concentration the semiconductor gap , @xmath2 , in the spin up density of states is closed hence a semiconductor to metal phase transition is happened . in the second case just exchange coupling is varied and other parameters are fixed , we found by increasing exchange coupling , j , the semiconducting gap , @xmath2 , of spin up electrons in their density of states is increased . in the last case",
    "just magnitude of spin , @xmath3 , is changed . in this case we found by increasing @xmath3 the semiconducting gap , @xmath2 , in the spin up density of states is increased .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian as a general random tight - binding model@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the a or b sites inside of the graphene bravais lattice unit cell , where each bravais lattice site is includes two nonequivalent sites that are indicated by a and b , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath9 on bravais lattice site @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath12 are the hopping integrals between the @xmath13 orbitals of sites @xmath10 and @xmath14 with spin @xmath9 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the chemical potential , @xmath17 is the random on - site energy where it takes @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 for host sites and @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 for impurity sites .",
    "@xmath22 is random exchange coupling between @xmath13 electrons and impurity spins where it takes @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 for host sites and @xmath1 with probability @xmath21 for impurity sites .",
    "@xmath23 is the impurity spin operator and @xmath24 is the electron spin operator . where @xmath25 is pauli matrix vector and @xmath26 is the coulomb interaction between electrons with opposite spin .",
    "the matrix form of eq.[eq : hamiltonian ] is , @xmath27 where the two - component field operator , @xmath28 , is given by @xmath29 @xmath30 is the random on - site energy matrix operator , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the hopping matrix in the spinor space defined by , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a @xmath35 unitary matrix .",
    "the electron s equation of motion corresponding to eq.[eq : hamiltonian ] in the mean field approximation where the operator @xmath36 is replaced by it s thermal averaged , @xmath37 , is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the random green function matrix defined by , @xmath40 here after spin flip is neglected , hence eq.[eq : fourtwosite green function ] is reduced to the two following separated equations for spin up and down electrons , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a @xmath43 random green function matrix for spin @xmath9 defined by , @xmath44 @xmath45 is hoping integral matrix for spin @xmath9 which is given by , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is random on site potential matrix for spin @xmath9 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 for spin up and -1 for spin down electrons .",
    "eq.[eq : twoequation of motion ] , could be rewritten in terms of the perfect green function matrix @xmath50 as , @xmath51 where @xmath50 is given by    @xmath52    with @xmath53 is the band structure for perfect system . in our calculations",
    "the hopping randomness are neglected also we allowed hopping to the nearest neighbors and neglected others , so @xmath54 where @xmath55 is clean system nearest neighbour hopping integral . hence @xmath56 and",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are three vectors that connect an a ( b ) site to it s nearest neighbors b(a ) sites .    the dyson equation for the averaged green function , @xmath60",
    ", corresponding to eq.[eq : expanding interms of random onsite potential ] is @xmath61 where the self energy @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 the fourier transform of @xmath60 in eq.[eq : dyson equation ] is given by , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the self energy fourier transform .",
    "since eqs.[eq : exact average green function ] , [ eq : dyson equation ] and [ eq : expanding interms of random onsite potential ] could not be solved exactly , we solve these equations in the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) . in the cpa multiple scattering",
    "is neglected and all sites are replaces by effective sites except one which is denoted by _ impurity _",

    "to investigate magnetic impurity effects on @xmath78 and @xmath79 zigzag swcnts , several cases are considered : first to obtain impurity concentration effects , average magnetization , @xmath80 , is calculated in terms of temperature at fixed @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , fig.[figure : fig1 ] illustrate average magnetization in terms of temperature for different impurity concentrations @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "also in this case at a fixed temperature , @xmath87 , spin up and spin down electrons density of states are compared for concentrations @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "figs.[figure : fig2 ] and [ figure : fig3 ] illustrate a semiconductor to metallic phase transition in the spin up electrons density of states due to increasing impurity concentration for the weak exchange coupling @xmath81 .    in the case of weak exchange coupling we found by increasing impurity concentration the semiconducting energy gap , @xmath2 , between valance band and conduction band is decreased and a semiconductor to metallic phase transition is occurred . while for strong coupling the spin up density of states is a semiconductor and for spin down is a metal .",
    "second , at a fixed impurity concentration , @xmath85 , for variable exchange coupling , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , average magnetization is calculated in terms of temperature .",
    "fig.[figure : fig4 ] shows effect of exchange coupling on average magnetization .",
    "we found for strong impurity couplings , the spin up electrons density of states remain a semiconductor with a small gap , @xmath2 , between valance and conduction bands , value of this gap is increased for higher exchange couplings , while the spin down electrons density of states is continues ( it has a metallic behavior ) .",
    "fig.[figure : fig5 ] and [ figure : fig6 ] illustrate our result for spin up and down electrons density of states for variable exchange coupling , @xmath1 , and fixed other parameter at @xmath85 , @xmath91 , @xmath83 , @xmath82 .",
    "third , to observe effects of impurity spin magnitude on our system we fixed , impurity concentration at , @xmath85 , exchange coupling at @xmath88 , on - site energy at @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "magnetization is calculated in terms of temperature for different impurity spin magnitudes @xmath92 , @xmath91 and @xmath93 .",
    "fig.[figure : fig7 ] show average magnetization in terms of temperature for different spins @xmath92 , @xmath91 and @xmath93 .",
    "we found by increasing impurity spin value , average magnetization is increased but the spin up electrons density of states has a gap , @xmath2 , which is groves by increasing impurity spin magnitude .",
    "figs.[figure : fig8 ] and [ figure : fig9 ] illustrate density of states for spin up and spin down electrons in this case .",
    "we have investigated possibility of making a ferromagnetic semiconductor zigzag swcnt , by doping magnetic impurities such as fe , co , ni , mn . the doped @xmath79 and @xmath78 zigzag swcnts are treated in the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) . to find out role of impurity on our systems three cases",
