    "indeed , the link between these two types of quantifiers , topological and metric entropy , is in terms of the choice of invariant measure .    given this classical and deeply rooted link between chaos and information theory , perhaps it is surprising that only recently we have finally realized that the link can be exploited , since chaotic oscillators can be controlled to transmit messages , @xcite .",
    "however , such exploitation of chaotic oscillators awaited the ( now obvious ) realization that chaos is controllable ; following the seminal  ogy \" paper @xcite at the beginning of this decade , there has literally been an explosion of various approaches and wide applications of the concept .",

    "however , there were practical obstacles : 1 ) experimentally observed chaotic dynamical systems are typically nonhyperbolic @xcite and therefore markov generating partitions are difficult to specify @xcite , 2 ) even small channel noise could cause bit - errors . for example , in the case of a two - symbol dynamics representation , a point * x * near the symbol partition , which bears the message bit , say a * 0 * , may be kicked across the partition by external noise , and therefore an the error - bit , a * 1 * , is inadvertently transmitted .",
    "one of us has recently co - authored a technique to solve both of these problems @xcite .",
    "avoiding neighborhoods of the generating partition , and _ all pre - iterates _ of the partition , yields an invariant cantor - like unstable chaotic saddle , which we showed , is robust to reasonably high noise amplitudes .",
