    "x - ray observations of nearby galaxies have shown that their x - ray emission comes from different classes of sources : x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , hot interstellar medium in addition to possible background active galactic nuclei ( agns ; see e.g. fabbiano 1989 for a review ) . some of the point - like sources appear to radiate well in excess of the eddington limit for a @xmath6 object , with inferred luminosities in the range @xmath7 . these objects are often referred to as ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) or intermediate - luminosity x - ray objects ( ixos ) , inasmuch their luminosity is in between those of `` normal '' x - ray binaries and agns .",
    "up to now about 90 ulxs have been detected in more than 50 galaxies ( see colbert & ptak 2002 for a recent catalog ) .",
    "ulxs seem to be preferentially located in the outskirts of the host galaxy , although some are found in the central regions ( e.g. ixo 95 in ngc 6949 ) .",
    "as pointed out by colbert & ptak , starburst galaxies contain a comparatively large number of ulxs , but spirals seem not to be favoured hosts with respect to ellipticals . in a very recent paper , moreover , evidence was found for a ulx associated with a globular cluster in ngc 4565 ( wu et al .",
    "ulxs are often variable sources and their x - ray spectrum may be quite soft ( e.g. makishima et al . 2000 ) . no certain optical counterpart has been found for these sources yet , implying an extreme x - ray  to - optical flux ratio .",
    "very recently pakull & mironi ( 2002 ) reported the presence of emission nebulae at the position of some ulxs and suggested that they could actually be related to the episode which led to the ulx formation .",
    "thus far no generally accepted model has been presented to explain the huge energy output of ulxs .",
    "assuming that the eddington limit is not exceeded and emission is isotropic implies that ulxs are powered by accretion onto a @xmath8 black hole .",
    "present evolutionary scenarios do not preclude such a possibility and the fact that these are rare sources may be compatible with the mean number of ulx per galaxy being only 1 - 2 ( colbert & ptak 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively ulxs may be interpreted as conventional black hole binaries ( @xmath9 ) with modest beaming coming from a collimated x - ray emission ( @xmath10 , king et al .",
    "2001 ) or to a relativistically beamed emission . in this picture the galactic analogues of ulxs",
    "should be the microquasars , such as grs 1915 + 105 and gro 1655 - 40 .",
    "this paper presents a multi - wavelength study of a new ulx , wga , found in ngc  4244 .",
    "this source is one of the 16 peculiar _",
    "pspc sources selected for their extremely high x - ray - to - optical flux ratio ( cagnoni et al .",
    "wga is a bright ( @xmath11 ) wgacat ( white , giommi & angelini 1994 ) source with blank fields , i.e. no optical counterparts on the palomar observatory sky survey to o=21.5 . the extreme ratio that follows is incompatible with all major and common classes of extragalactic sources , including normal quasars , agns , normal galaxies and nearby clusters of galaxies ( maccacaro et al .",
    "possibilities for the nature of these ` blanks ' ( cagnoni et al .",
    "2002 ) include : ( a ) quasar-2s , i.e. high luminosity , high redshift heavily obscured quasars , the bright analogs of seyfert  2s ; ( b ) low mass seyfert-2s , agns powered by a low - mass obscured black hole ( i.e. obscured narrow line sy  1 ) ; ( c ) agns with no big blue bump , e.g. low radiative efficiency flows ; ( d ) isolated neutron stars ( e.g. treves et al . 2000 ) ; ( e ) @xmath12-ray burst x - ray afterglows or fast variable/ transient sources ; ( f ) failed clusters , in which a large overdensity of matter has collapsed but has not formed galaxies ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) ; ( g ) high redshift clusters of galaxies and , most relevant to this paper , ( h ) ulxs in nearby galaxies .    using x - ray archival data ( _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ ) and the information obtained from optical and ir follow - ups , we present strong evidence that wga is indeed a ulx in ngc  4244 , a b=-18.4 ( olling 1996 ) edge - on spiral galaxy ( hubble type scd ) at a distance of @xmath13  mpc ( fry et al .",

    "( 2002 ) ; we summarize here the main findings . during the 9  ks pspc observation ( 600179n00 ) a total of 135 net photons were collected between 0.07 and 2.4 kev .",
    "we extracted a spectrum and fitted it with both an absorbed power - law and an absorbed blackbody model . despite the scanty statistics and the large error bars both fits agree on the extreme softness of wga emission ( @xmath15 for the power - law and @xmath16 ev for the blackbody models respectively ) and on the presence of absorption a factor of 10 - 30 in excess of the galactic value in this direction ( @xmath17 @xmath1 ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath1 for the power - law and blackbody models , respectively ) .",
    "the source absorbed flux in the @xmath21 kev band is @xmath22 , which corresponds to an absorbed luminosity of @xmath23 erg  s@xmath4 and to an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath24 erg  s@xmath4 for both the power - law and black body models at ngc  4244 distance .",

    "wga is 6  kpc off ngc  4244 center and is detected as a point - like source on acis - s s2 front illuminated chip with a total of 1948 counts between 0.3 and 10 kev with peak position at @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we reprocessed _",
    "archival data using the cxc analysis package ciao 2.2.1 ( elvis et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and caldb 2.9 .",
    "the source position determination was improved by using the new geometry parameter file added to caldb 2.9 and by removing the pixel randomization of @xmath31 pixels introduced by the standard _",
    "chandra _ pipeline processing ( e.g. garcia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we corrected the data for bad pixels and checked for high particle background times during the observation . the observation is not affected by any significant background flare .",
    "wga average count rate during this observation is @xmath32 photons s@xmath4 between 0.3 and 10 kev for a total of 1948 counts in the @xmath33  ks of net exposure . in a conservative test to confirm whether any background flare might affect our results ,",
    "we have excluded the time intervals with background count rate a factor 1.2 larger or smaller than the mean value during the observation , as suggested by ciao 2.2.1 science threads ( http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/acisbackground/ ) .",
    "this would bring to an useful exposure time of 42  ks and to 1653 net photons ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) for wga .",

    "errors represent here 1@xmath37 confidence . ] .",
    "we extracted a spectrum for the source using a circle with radius @xmath38 ( 35 pixels ) and a local background in an annular region with radii of 20@xmath27 and 50@xmath27 ( 40 and 100 pixels ) respectively from which a circle of 15@xmath27 centered on a nearby source was excluded .",
    "we binned the spectrum to have a minimum of 30 counts per bin and fitted it with sherpa between 0.3 and 10.0 kev with an absorbed power - law model and an absorbed disk blackbody .",
    "both models proved to be a poor representation of the data and the results are unchanged when the acis quantum efficiency degradation is taken into account .",
    "we tried with more complex models , such as an absorbed power - law @xmath14 disk blackbody , an absorbed power - law @xmath14 a raymond - smith thermal plasma and an absorbed broken power - law and they are all acceptable . the spectrum and the residuals to an absorbed power - law model are reported in figure  [ fig1 ] and the results of all the fits are reported in table  1 .",
    "we also report in table  1 the 0.5 - 10 kev absorbed fluxes and the 0.5 - 10 kev absorbed and unabsorbed luminosities of the source .",
    "it is clear from table  1 that : ( i ) wga spectrum is extremely soft ( @xmath39 ) ; ( ii ) simple models give an unacceptable fit to the data ; ( iii ) all but the broken power - law model predict a high column density ( @xmath40 @xmath1 ) in wga direction ; ( iv ) wga unabsorbed 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity is @xmath41 erg s@xmath4 ( for all but the broken power - law model , which could mimic the absorption with a flatter low energy slope and for the disk blackbody model , which is the statisticcally worst model ) .",
    "we extracted lightcurves for the source and background between 0.3 and 10 kev using the same circular and annular regions used for the spectral analysis .",
    "the background subtracted lightcurve of wga binned over 5000  s is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] and the source displays a factor 1.5 variability .",
    "a fit with a constant model gives a @xmath42% probability for constant emission , indicating that wga is variable on timescales @xmath43 5000  s. we have confirmed the variability by an independent method using a bayesian - block analysis to the unbinned data which has recently been developed for the _ chandra _ multi - wavelength project ( j. drake , private communication ; kim et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we obtained deep ir imaging in the k - band ( to @xmath44 ) with nsfcam at nasa / irtf on january 2000 and deep r - band imaging ( to @xmath45 ) with mosaic at kpno 4 m in february 2001 .",
    "we performed standard imaging reduction using iraf version 2.11.3 and calculated accurate astrometric solutions for the data using the digital sky survey .",
    "the _ chandra _ error box ( 0.67@xmath27 at 95% confidence level for @xmath46 net photons at @xmath47 off - axis , kim et al . in preparation ) contains only one object ( at @xmath48 from _ chandra _ central position ) , which appears stellar on the r image ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "wga counterpart lies in the optical extent of ngc  4244 , at @xmath49 kpc from the galaxy center , and it is thus likely to be associated to the galaxy ( we exclude a possible agn in the background in   [ sec_discussion ] ) .",
    "since the night was not photometric we obtained an estimate of the source magnitude rescaling from the usno catalog sources in the 17.020.0 r - magnitude range falling on the ccd .",
    "the estimated r - band magnitude is @xmath50 , while the source is not visible in the k - band image down to k@xmath51 .",
    "the x - ray over r - band flux ratio , defined as in hornschemeir et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , is @xmath52 .",
    "we searched for radio counterparts from the first and the nvss surveys but none were found within @xmath53 of the _ chandra _ position , setting an upper limit of @xmath54 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the properties of wga indicate that it is an ulx in ngc  4244 .",
    "the source absorbed flux in the 0.52.0 kev band derived from _",
    "chandra _ data ( @xmath55 ) is consistent within the errors with that measured with _",
    "rosat _ ( @xmath56 ) , so the source appears not to have significantly varied between the two observations ( @xmath57 yrs ) .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of wga at ngc  4244 distance is @xmath58 for the absorbed power law model note however , that the 50  ks _ chandra _ observation provides evidence for variability on a much shorter timescale ( @xmath59 s ) .",
    "we also found that the spectral shape did not change from the _ rosat _ observation and , although no simple emission model gives a satisfactory fit , the x - ray continuum appears to be very soft and can be roughly described by a very steep absorbed power - law with @xmath60 but not with thermal emission .",
    "a complex spectral shape was also found for the stacked spectra obtained from the ulxs in the antennea galaxies by zezas et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ( see their figure  2 ) : the spectrum presented here for wga suggests that the complexity might not be the effect of the superposition of different types of ulx spectra , but it is intrinsic to each source .    using the x - ray flux at 1 kev from the absorbed power - law fit , the r - band magnitude and the upper limit at 1.4 ghz we computed wga broad band spectral indices according to the formula @xmath61 we used the canonical 1  kev , v - band ( 5500  ) and 5  ghz points , by extrapolating the r - band flux density to the v - band and the 1.4 ghz flux density to 5 ghz assuming a flat spectral shape , and we obtain @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "such values place wga out of the region occupied by agns in the @xmath65@xmath66 plane ( e.g. caccianiga et al .",
    "1999 ) since not even the most extreme bl lac objects can reach such values ( e.g. costamante & ghisellini 2002 ) .",
    "taking absorption into account would make the situation even more extreme ( e.g. an absorbing column of @xmath67 @xmath1 with galactic dust to gas ratio would enhance the x - ray flux by a factor of @xmath68 and the optical flux of a factor @xmath49 ) .",
    "we can thus exclude the possibility of wga being a background agn .",
    "we can also exclude the possibility of wga being a supernova remnant for the short timescale variability displayed in the _ chandra _ observation and by the lack of a significant fading in the 9 years between the _ rosat _ and the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "even if the best fit model for wga , a convex absorbed broken power - law , is usually used to describe the synchrotron peak observed in beamed sources such as blazars , the sharp change in the power - law shape of wga ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) is difficult to reconcile with the smoothly curving blazar synchrotron peak ( e.g. @xmath71 , @xmath72 measured for mrk  421 by guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "wga luminosity falls at the lower end of the ulx range .",
    "some emission models implies @xmath73 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in particular , the absorbed power - law plus raymond - smith model , and the absorbed broken power - law models , which have the lowest @xmath74 , give a luminosity of only few @xmath75 .",
    "this would make wga an ordinary x - ray binary in ngc  4244 . however , optically thin bremsstrahlung emission is typical of extended sources , like clusters of galaxies , and we found no evidence for a diffuse nature of this source in _ chandra _ data and the broken power - law model does not have a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the relatively low luminosity of wga may still suggest that this source is an x - ray binary with a @xmath76 black hole , of the cyg x-1 type .",
    "the x - ray spectrum however strongly argues against this possibility , being much softer of those of galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "bhcs spectra in the high state are thermal and soft , but peak around a few kev and extend up to @xmath68 kev .",
    "the extreme softness of the x - ray spectrum makes this source rather peculiar among the ulxs .",
    "in fact , while very soft spectra have been already detected from other ulxs with _ rosat _ , successive observations over a wider energy range showed a harder component .",
    "an example of this behaviour is ms 0317.7@xmath776647 which has been first associated with an isolated neutron star by stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) on the basis of its soft , thermal spectrum .",
    "the source was later identified with a ulx by makishima et al .",
    "( 2000 ) when _ asca _ data convincingly showed a hard tail ( @xmath78 ) , possibly associated with a multicolor disk blackbody . before the advent of _ chandra _ the ulxs seen by _ rosat _ and _ asca _ were consistent with emission from a multicolor disk blackbody ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) ; _ chandra _ is now discovering a new class of steep ulx ( e.g. out of the 30 ulx of zezas et al .",
    "2002b , 9 have a steep spectrum ) .",
    "wga is the source for which the best _ chandra _ spectrum is available so far . in the study of the antennae galaxies zezas et al .",
    "( 2002a ) find steeper spectra for the least luminous ulx : wga seem to fit in this picture , interpreted with the possible presence of undetected diffuse hot interstellar medium in the proximity of the source .",
    "alternatively one could consider that the indication of a luminosity dependent spectral shape is due to different accretion properties .",
    "the steep ulxs could be the `` galactic '' analog of narrow line seyfert galaxies ( a steep version of the seyfert galaxies ) which are thought to be powered by a lower mass black hole accreting at a higher rate compared to `` normal '' seyferts .",
    "follow - up optical observations allowed us to discover a possible counterpart of wga at @xmath48 from _ chandra _ position .",
    "the association is based only on the positional coincidence .",
    "error box is quite small ( 95% confidence radius @xmath79 , kim et al . in preparation ) and the background field is not very crowded ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , so the possibility of a chance alignment appears unlikely , albeit it can not be ruled out on the basis of present data .",
    "the optical counterpart has @xmath80 ; if this source is a star in ngc  4244 , it has to be a red star or its bolometric correction would imply a luminosity not compatible with even the most luminous stars known .",
    "the most likely possibility is that the suggested counterpart is a late type giant / supergiant , like a m5 ii - iii ; for this spectral range the source luminosity , corrected for extinction , would be @xmath81 , about @xmath82 .",
    "the r - k@xmath83 derived from the ir non - detection is not stringent and it is satisfied by the red stars .",
    "ulxs are one of the most interesting class of sources which are now being investigated by the x - ray satellites _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. we presented in this paper the best spectrum ( @xmath84 photons ) available so far for a steep - spectrum ulx .",
    "steep ulxs , like wga , , appear to be related to the least luminous objects of the ulx class ( e.g. zezas et al .",
    "2002a ) and were essentially unknown before the launch of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. future investigations are needed to understand the emission mechanisms powering these sources and to confirm and explain a possible luminosity dependence of the spectral shape .",
