    "in this supplementary material section we will first provide the details of our experimental setup and then discuss the validity of some crucial assumptions of the well known theories of the iqhe .",
    "namely , first we will briefly discuss the assumptions on different boundary conditions and topological aspects of the quantized hall samples within the single - particle ( sp ) theories .",
    "the main discussion is on the mapping between the momentum space representation of the edge states to real space representation .",
    "this discussion clarifies the importance of boundary conditions , where the normalisation condition is the only physical restriction . here , instead of a detailed mathematical description",
    "we will make use of some schematic presentations which are common in the qhe discussions . however , to lift the confusion between different theories we used distinguishing colours to discriminate single - particle and screening theory concepts , e.g. incompressibility , edge states , etc .",
    "our first discussion is based on the single - particle theory , where incompressible ( namely energy gapped region or so to say insulating ) bulk is essential for qhe and the incompressible regions are denoted by blue colour .",
    "we denote the sp chiral edge states by solid lines , which differ by colours depicting different filling factors , e.g. red corresponds to @xmath40 edge state where spin degree of freedom is neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "consistent with the main text , we denote compressible 2des by green and incompressible 2des by black , within the screening theory .",
    "yellow regions denote the contacts , whereas white corresponds to electron depleted ( etched ) regions for both theories .",
    "first , we aim to clarify that , using periodic boundary conditions for finite size hall bars is questionable which then makes topological arguments prone to break .",
    "second we would like to highlight that , considering quantum capacitance in calculating impedance or current modifies both the sp and screening theory results .",
    "and third , we explicitly show that our sample geometry is quite different then the well known corbino and the anti - hall bar geometries .      in this paper",
    "our aim is to show that the bulk of the hall bar is not incompressible through out quantum hall plateaus by direct transport measurements .",
    "our samples are defined on high purity gaas / algaas wafers , produced at braun center for submicron research .",
    "the hall bars are 10 @xmath30 wide and 40 @xmath30 m long , defined by chemical etching .",
    "hall contacts are designed like a  lizard \" such that they are not effected by the inner contacts .",
    "we embedded two inner contacts to the bulk of the hall bar utilising air bridge technique , each inner contact has approximately 1 @xmath30m@xmath65 area and they are 7.5 @xmath30 m apart from each other . to measure hall effect we excite the 2deg by imposing a constant ac voltage between the source and drain contacts at 8.54 hz by a lock - in amplifier ( sr 850 , with an internal impedance of 10 m@xmath66 + 25 pf ) .",
    "a 10 m@xmath66 resistance is placed between inner contact a and source contact , whereas a 1 k@xmath66 resistance is placed between inner contact b and drain contact .",
    "we measure hall voltage ( both x and y components ) between contacts 2 - 3 or 1 - 4 . to check whether the hall voltage is affected by inner contacts we also reversed source and drain contacts and observed similar features .",
    "similar to hall voltage measurements , we excite the inner contacts by a lock - in amplifier at 11.5 hz , followed by a 10 m@xmath66 resistance before contact a and 1 k@xmath66 resistance after contact b. we measure the potential difference between the inner contacts , while a low - noise preamplifier is utilized to filter high frequency noise ( @xmath67 30 hz ) .",
    "all the signals go through a room temperature rc circuit to filter noise above 92 khz .",
    "we used 300 ms time constant and swept the magnetic field by a 0.1 t / min rate .",
    "the measurements are repeated for many thermal cycles and different samples defined on the same wafer .",
    "all the results were consistent .        once the landau hamiltonian is solved using coulomb ( also called landau ) gauge , i.e. translational invariance in @xmath68 direction and open boundary conditions in @xmath69 direction ( @xmath70 ) , the solution yields plane waves in the current ( @xmath68 ) direction as if as a free electron and harmonic oscillator wave functions in the other direction .",
    "such a choice of gauge and boundary conditions can be utilized to describe a homogeneous hall bar that extends to infinity in both directions . however , to describe a more realistic hall bar one usually assumes infinite walls in @xmath69 direction , which modifies the related wave - functions by parabolic cylinder functions approaching to simple harmonic oscillator solutions away from the boundaries . however , these preferences of boundary conditions yield the problem of normalisation . in order to overcome the normalisation problem one assumes periodicity in momentum along the current direction similar to bloch wave function describing electrons in a crystal . as the hall bar is not periodic in real space",
    ", one can not impose periodicity in @xmath68 , hence , periodicity in @xmath71 is assumed .",
    "this assumption yields to the well known description of thouless  @xcite which explains quantised hall effect in terms of chern numbers in _ momentum _ space , where one simply counts the berry flux encircled and describes transport utilising the kubo formalism .",
    "such an approach is well justified only if the system is in electrostatic equilibrium , i.e. if no external current is imposed , or might be reasonable if the qhe can be treated within the linear response regime , if it can be handled within this regime at all .",
    "* cylindrical geometry .",
    "* in the earliest attempt to elucidate iqhe , laughlin proposed that if a 2des resides on the surface of a cylinder and a time dependent perpendicular magnetic field penetrates the surface , then to protect the geometrical phase only an elementary charge can be moved from one end of the cylinder to the other end when the flux changes by one quantum . in this description periodicity in real space is assumed , however , the boundary conditions are not specified in the perpendicular direction .",
    "in contrast , in the approach of thouless the periodicity is imposed in momentum space @xmath71 , where the 2des is defined on a flat surface . ]",
    "the first case can be ruled out in our experiments since we excite the system by an external voltage .",
    "the second case is also ruled out , since the excitation energy ( voltage ) is comparable with the landau gap , hence the system is far away from linear response . in",
    "contrary to periodicity in momentum space , laughlin assumed periodicity in real space considering a cylinder where instead of an imposed current he assumed a radial magnetic field which changes adiabatically by time ( cf .",
    "[ fig : add1 ] ) , leading to a phase which is protected by the topology resulting in conductance quantisation .",
    "@xcite this approach also for sure does not entirely describe the experimental realisation of the qhe , at least for our experiments .",
    "both of the descriptions of the qhe implicitly require a bulk incompressibility , namely an energy gap induced by the magnetic field .",
    "this is somewhat similar to 3 + 1 d topological insulators where an energy gap opens due to crystal structure and provides an incompressible ( insulating ) bulk .",
    "@xcite however , note that this gap is in the energy dispersion , namely when one plots the relation between the energy and momentum there opens a gap due to symmetries of the crystal .",
    "similarly , for an infinite hall bar with periodic boundary conditions one can obtain such a gapped energy dispersion in momentum space , which is usually mapped to real space without taking care of the boundary conditions of the physical devices . for a finite width and length ( flat ) hall bar assuming periodic boundary conditions is not appropriate .",
    "hence , bulk incompressibility which is essential to describe qhe does not apply to our physical system at hand . in connection with 3 + 1 d topological insulators",
    ", we should note that in this case the system is periodic in ( crystal ) momentum space and hence the energy dispersion presents the well appreciated  topologically \" protected energy gap . in contrast , qhe does not provide the periodicity in momentum space once realistic , i.e. physical , boundary conditions are considered .

    "@xcite in his pioneering work he imposed the above mentioned infinite wall boundary conditions in the radial direction @xmath72 , which essentially bends the landau levels in the close vicinity of boundaries .",
    "utilising periodicity in azimuthal ( @xmath73 ) direction ( both in momentum and real space ) , one can map the energy dispersion ( i.e. energy versus momentum ) to real space ( i.e. energy versus @xmath72 ) and obtain the geometry known as the corbino geometry , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : add2]a . in the original work",
    "it is stated that this is a  slight modification \" of laughlin s cylindrical geometry ( see fig .  [ fig : add1 ] ) , which is not reasonable from topological point of view in real space , since the genus numbers are different ( for laughlin s case it is 1 , since periodicity is also assumed in @xmath74 which defines essentially a torus , and for halperin s case it is 0 ) .",
    "we should also note that , due to the absence of edges in laughlin s geometry , the current is uni - directional , whereas at a corbino edge states are present and carry chiral current .",
    "for a corbino geometry , in contrast to a hall bar ( cf .",
    "[ fig : add2]b ) , there are no source and drain contacts , however , the edge states exist due to boundaries where all the system is in equilibrium .",
    "namely , no external current can be and is imposed . in this geometry",
    ", one can measure the conductance between the inner and outer contacts if contacts are kept at different electrochemical potentials .",
    "in such a system the electrical measurements essentially results in a quantised hall conductance .",
    "it is also stated that  in a real experiment , the measured hall potential @xmath75 is the sum of an electrostatic potential @xmath76 and the difference in fermi levels @xmath77 ( electrochemical potential difference in our notation ) .",
    "the edge current is then only a _ fraction _ of the total hall current , given by ( e_f^(2)-e_f^(1))/ev n r_c_cc / e^2,[eq : halperin]where @xmath12 is the capacitance per unit length of the edge states , and @xmath78 is a number of unity . \" . here , @xmath79 is an integer determined by the filling factor @xmath5 at the bulk and fermi energy lies in between the energies @xmath80 of two landau levels @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in the interior of the sample .",
    "the electrochemical potentials near the boundaries ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 , at @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , where the contacts reside ) are also supposed to lie in the interval @xmath87 , which implicitly assumes linear response .",
    "then the total current carried by the edge states between @xmath83 and @xmath84 is given by @xmath88 .",
    "now , we should clarify couple of points with the properties of contacts and their equilibration with edge states : first , in halperin s approach it is implicitly assumed that the capacitances @xmath89 and @xmath90 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : add2]a are neglected , which imposes that the contacts are in electrochemical equilibrium with the edge states , namely the scattering between the edge states and contacts is possible pointing a compressible edge .",
    "hence , the contribution to hall current in real experiments only come from the bulk capacitance , which is quantised if finite tdos at @xmath4 is assumed .",
    "if the compressible edge assumption is lifted , then the total capacitance would be the sum of @xmath89 , @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "for @xmath92 the total capacitance would yield an edge current approximately @xmath93 , which is not quantised .",
    "here we assumed @xmath94 . for higher bulk",
    "filling factors , such an approach implicitly assumes that the inner edge states are in equilibrium with each other similar to the outer edge states , which again requires that the edges are compressible , i.e. scattering between inner or outer edge states is possible .",
    "this assumption then makes the current quantisation questionable .    as discussed in the main text and details given in the following subsection",
    ", capacitance is composed of the classical and the quantum counterparts .",
    "once , the region between two edge states ( or contacts ) is insulating ( namely incompressible ) then the quantum capacitance vanishes for an ideally pure system .",
    "hence the hall current mentioned above reads to zero , i.e. impedance diverges . in real experimental devices",
    "there are potential fluctuations due to disorder which yield localised states as discussed by halperin , which then results in conductance quantisation for a finite magnetic field interval , where bulk incompressibility is still preserved .",
    "furthermore , once again the main assumption is the incompressibility of the bulk , i.e. the impedance between the inner and the outer contacts reads to infinity ( or relatively high compared to conductance ) hence the conductance measured between these contacts should be quantised . to be explicit , if one wants to move an electron from one contact to the other one has to get across @xmath79 edge states ( namely pass through metal - topological insulator boundary @xmath79 times ) and has to pay an amount of energy that corresponds to @xmath79 ( berry ) flux quanta , yielding to quantisation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : add2 ] we present both the hall bar and the corbino geometries also depicting  edge states \" .",
    "note that , in the corbino geometry edge states are parallel to the contacts whereas for the hall bar geometry they are perpendicular to the contacts .",
    "hence , the impedance is infinite ( or huge for real devices at finite @xmath62 ) for the corbino geometry , however , for the hall bar capacitance vanishes ( or much smaller then the resistance ) considering a  bttiker \" contact , i.e. transmission from the contact to edge state is unity .",
    "it is important to note that , the mathematical mapping between the momentum and real space representations of the edge states makes sense only if the periodicity is preserved , which is the case for the corbino geometry .",
    "however , when a finite size hall bar is considered such a mapping becomes questionable , at least for all geometries .",
    "couple of years later than the work of halperin , bttiker developed a transport theory based on the landauer formalism to describe the iqhe .",
    "@xcite in his work also the finite size of the hall bar is taken into account by imposing a confinement potential in @xmath69 direction , which essentially varies smoothly on quantum mechanical length scales .",
    "although yielding to similar results with halperin , the smooth confinement potential allows one to use simple harmonic oscillator solutions also close to the boundaries .",
    "in addition , the scattering probability between edge states at the same boundary is suppressed by the fact that the edge states are relatively far apart from each other both in real space and in momentum space . utilising the periodicity in momentum space in equilibrium one",
    "can then map the momentum space representation of edge states to real space and draw the well known  bttiker \" edge states for a hall bar as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : add2]b .",
    "this picture is modified if an external current is imposed by applying a voltage difference @xmath95 between the source and drain contacts , yielding an electrochemical potential energy difference @xmath96 .",
    "of course in this non - equilibrium situation assuming periodic boundary conditions become questionable , where one end of the hall bar is kept at potential @xmath97 . turning back to our discussion on the capacitances and calculating the actual hall current",
    "one can still utilise eq .",
    "[ eq : halperin ] .",
    "note that the edge states at the same sides have the same electrochemical potential , hence , @xmath89 and @xmath90 vanishes and the only contribution to capacitance comes from @xmath91 . once again , for an ideal 2des capacitance vanishes yielding zero hall current pointing a back - scattering free transport throughout the plateau interval .",
    "however , even a small amount of tdos below @xmath4 would yield a finite capacitance , hence a finite hall current which would result in deviations from perfect quantisation .    by the above discussion",
    ", we have shown that the momentum - real space duality of both halperin and bttiker edge states becomes questionable since such a duality strongly depends on the imposed boundary conditions and the symmetries of the sample .",
    "in addition , once the quantum capacitance is taken into account , which is directly proportional to tdos at @xmath4 , impedance between probe contacts also strongly depends on the edge state configurations , namely whether the edge states are perpendicular or parallel to imposed current .",
    "such geometrical and topological aspects of so called qhe samples are usually undermentioned in the well known theories .",
    "* screening theory expectation of a corbino disc . *",
    "the inner and outer contacts are decoupled by a bulk incompressible region denoted by black . however ,",
    "if the magnetic field is reduced the picture essentially does not change drastically . at a lower @xmath3 field ,",
    "the bulk incompressible region will split into two encircling incompressible rings near the edges and since the capacitances are connected in series the contacts would be still decoupled . ]    in a simplistic treatment , inverse capacitance can be described as the amount of energy to add a charge to a system , given by @xmath98 .",
    "classically , one can approximate the capacitance of a sheet as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : add3 ] as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the dielectric constant , @xmath101 is the perimeter of the ring , @xmath102 is the width of the incompressible strip and @xmath103 is the distance between the gate and the 2des .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the quantum capacitance per area is solely dependent on the thermodynamical density of states given by @xmath104 .",
    "since these two capacitances are connected in series , the total capacitance is given by @xmath105 .",
    "the classical capacitance is finite except that the width of the incompressible region is infinite , however , the quantum capacitance becomes zero if there exists an incompressible strip between the inner and outer contacts at zero temperature and for an ideally clean system , i.e. no level broadening due to impurities .",
    "therefore , the capacitance is dominated by the quantum counterpart if there exists an incompressible strip decoupling the contacts .",
    "note that , the contacts and the compressible regions are in electrochemical equilibrium , since they both behave like a metal .",
    "furthermore , since scattering is suppressed exponentially along the incompressible ring and is quantised across the ring , resistance is much smaller than the total capacitance therefore impedance reads z 1/d_t(e_f ) .",
    "hence , for a corbino geometry the bulk incompressibility is the guarantee of conductance quantisation within the single particle picture .",
    "however , when interactions are taken into account we observe that it is not necessary to have an incompressible bulk and only a single incompressible strip is sufficient to decouple inner and outer contacts .",
    "the next discussion is on the thermodynamical definition of incompressibility which is a statistical quantity .",
    "one usually defines a system to incompressible if the ratio between the change in number of particles and the change in electrochemical potential presents a discontinuity .",
    "note that , electrochemical potential is a statistical quantity which makes sense physically only if there are sufficient number of particles within the system considered .",
    "therefore , assigning incompressibility to a strip is bounded by the number of particles within the strip , which is essentially determined by the fermi wavelength at zero temperature .",
    "hence , once the strip width becomes small or comparable with the fermi wave length the insulating behaviour of the strip is destroyed .",
    "such a situation can be considered as a leaky capacitor , as stated in the main text . in addition ,",
    "when the strip width becomes even smaller than the magnetic length , which is the quantum mechanical length scale , then it is possible to tunnel across the incompressible strip by quasi - inelastic scattering mechanisms .",

    "interestingly , even at the transition between @xmath110 to @xmath40 plateau the inner edge states should provide a high capacitance .",

    "<S> the energy gap emanates from many - body interactions , based on exchange and correlation effects , and @xmath5 assumes some particular fractional numbers .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite quite generally , the bulk insulating region is assumed to be incompressible and provides a scattering free region between the probe contacts .    </S>",
    "<S> the rationale behind the relation between the incompressible topological bulk insulator and the conductance quantisation stems from the mathematical map between the landau hamiltonian and the bloch hamiltonian defined on a periodic system , which can be well understood physically in terms of the berry phase .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite each time the field is increased by one magnetic flux quantum @xmath6 @xmath7 , an electron is adiabatically transferred from one edge of the cylinder to the other edge ( cf . supplementary material fig.4 ) , keeping the geometrical phase protected . in the standard picture , the charge transport along the edges is described by the single particle , i.e. , non - interacting , edge states which form due to level bending imposed by the boundary conditions . the transport is regarded as non - local and dissipationless .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite assuming periodic boundaries , the hall conductance @xmath8 is a topological invariant , namely the chern number , which can be elegantly proven using the kubo formalism . in the case of the iqhe with @xmath9 </S>",

    "<S> * discussion *    we base our model on the formation of the compressible and the incompressible strips resulting from electron - electron interactions and the confinement . since the non - interacting single particle picture yields a stepwise density distribution violating the electrostatic equilibrium ( cf . supplementary material fig.5 ) , it is propounded that the 2des comprises local insulator - like incompressible regions surrounded by metal - like compressible regions . </S>",
    "<S> strips with integer @xmath5 emanate from direct coulomb ( hartree ) interaction , whereas , the strips assuming fractional filling factors account on many - body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account interactions and lateral confinement results in the fact that the incompressible region(s ) can reside at the bulk , as well as along the edges . </S>",
    "<S> the former is called the bulk incompressible region , whereas the later is called the edge incompressible strip . the spatial distribution and the widths of the incompressible strips </S>",

    "<S> @xcite assuming a constant @xmath4 , the evolution of the incompressible regions with changing @xmath3 field can be summarised as follows : let us start with a situation where the field is sufficiently high and only the lowest landau level is partially filled , hence , the average filling factor is less than 2 ( neglecting the spin degeneracy ) . due to the lateral confinement , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the electron density is inhomogeneous such that it reaches its highest value close to the centre ( at the bulk ) whereas gradually decreases towards the edges and vanishes at the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath41 is larger than that of at the edges .    </S>",

    "<S> once the @xmath3 field is decreased , the fermi energy falls into the landau gap at the bulk yielding @xmath47 , hence the bulk becomes incompressible . </S>",
    "<S> this resembles the single - particle description of the iqhe , where the @xmath22 is quantised and @xmath42 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> further decrease of the field results in a situation where the incompressible regions shift towards edges and become narrow , due to the electron density gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties and evolution of strips along the edges are the well understood both experimentally and theoretically,@xcite and guarantee quantised @xmath22 together with vanishing @xmath42 by the thermodynamical and the electrical decoupling of the probe contacts . </S>",
    "<S> namely , scattering between contacts is prohibited by the incompressible regions between them . </S>",
    "<S> here we used the fundamental principle of thermodynamics in determining the ( in)compressibility of the strips : thermodynamical quantities are physically meaningful only if there are sufficiently large number of particles , which dictates a lower bound for the length scales . at @xmath18 this length is the fermi wavelength , @xmath48 , since only the electrons at @xmath4 contribute to current . </S>",
    "<S> therefore once the width of the incompressible strip becomes comparable or less than @xmath48 , assigning incompressibility to strips become meaningless , physically . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is thermodynamically reasonable to expect that at a certain @xmath3 field the width of incompressible strips become narrower than @xmath48 and scattering between neighbouring compressible regions and thereby the probe contacts is possible . in this situation </S>",

    "<S> we start our investigation with a situation where the lowest landau level is partially occupied , i.e. , the 2des is completely compressible as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]f . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2 ] shows the measured potential difference between the inner contacts @xmath23 ( broken ( blue ) line ) , the hall potential @xmath22 ( solid thin line ) and the potential difference between contacts 3 and 4 ( thick ( red ) solid line ) , @xmath42 . in the graphical demonstrations ( a - f ) the electron density variation is depicted by the colour gradient ( green ) , which vanishes ( white ) near both the inner ( red square boxes ) and the source - drain contacts ( yellow , rectangular boxes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black coloured areas correspond to incompressible ( constant density ) regions . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to note that , sketching the density gradient and its behaviour near the contacts is well justified both experimentally and theoretically .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we see that for @xmath51 ( case f ) @xmath22 and @xmath42 increase ( almost ) linearly , whereas , @xmath23 considerably small . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour suggests that the bulk of the 2des acts as a poorly conducting metal , as predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the behaviour of @xmath23 by modelling the bulk as serially connected resistances , composed of the inner contact resistance(s ) @xmath43 and the resistance of the 2des between contacts @xmath44 . decreasing the magnetic field , results in the quantisation of @xmath22 and an increase in @xmath23 , whereas @xmath42 remains non - zero ( case e ) . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate these behaviours as follows : the region between contacts 1 and 4 becomes incompressible and decouples the hall contacts and yielding a perfect quantisation . </S>",
    "<S> however due to the density gradient induced by the inner contacts , the entire bulk is not incompressible . </S>",
    "<S> we model this situation by a resistance and a capacitor ( @xmath45 ) connected in parallel . since the capacitance approaches zero due to @xmath52 , all the measured potential results from @xmath44 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition there are regions between the contacts 3 and 4 where scattering takes place , yielding a non - zero @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , @xmath42 approaches zero in the e@xmath53 case since the resistance along the leaky incompressible strip is reduced compared to a fully compressible bulk , as in case e@xmath54 . lowering @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> further , results in formation of a bulk incompressible region , hence insulating state , spread all over the sample : case d. here , qhe is well developed and @xmath23 becomes remarkably large and is bound by a cutoff voltage , which we attribute to finite tdos at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , since @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the excess current , the impedance reads @xmath57 constant . at a lower @xmath3 the bulk incompressible region </S>",
    "<S> splits into strips , two of which reside along the edges and the other two encircling the inner contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the edge strips decouple hall contacts and , simultaneously , the encircling strips decouple the inner contacts due to their approximately infinite capacitance , resulting in a constant @xmath23 , known as the corbino effect .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite note that , from the plotted measurements one can not quantitatively determine the boundary between case ( c ) and ( d ) , however , when we discuss the temperature effects this transition will become clear . </S>",
    "<S> the cardinal situation is where the encircling strips become thermodynamically compressible , i.e. similar to a leaky capacitor depicted by broken lines as depicted in case e@xmath53 , whereas the edge strips are still well decoupling as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b by solid strips . in short , </S>",
    "<S> the evanescent encircling strips can be considered as leaky capacitors and the impedance between inner contacts is modelled similar to that of case ( f ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the edge strips are sufficiently wide , due to smoother edge density profile compared to that of in front of the inner contacts , and therefore decouple hall contacts yielding a plateau . </S>",
    "<S> the edge strips connect contacts 3 - 4 , hence , @xmath42 is still zero . </S>",
    "<S> the situation in case ( a ) is trivial , where the edge strips also become transparent to hall voltage and iqhe fades . </S>",
    "<S> now , we are obliged to answer questions asked at the end of the previous section . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 is constant only in a certain @xmath3 subinterval since the inner contacts are only decoupled by the incompressible bulk ( case d ) or by the encircling incompressible strips ( case c ) for a specific @xmath3 interval and the observed asymmetry is a direct result of incompressible state distribution depending on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> namely at low field side it is due to encircling strips whereas at high field side it emanates from the bulk incompressible region . </S>",
    "<S> our model also covers the @xmath58 and 2/3 plateaus , by lifting the assumption on spin effects and taking the energy gap to be the zeeman gap for @xmath58 and the many - body gap for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for all other visible plateaus we do not observe the saturated @xmath23 , which suggests that the 2des does not comprise an entire incompressible bulk . </S>",
    "<S> note that , for @xmath60 and 4 the maximum value of the spikes hits the constant value @xmath61 1.35 mv .    </S>",
    "<S> as the incompressibility conditions of the edge or encircling strips are critical to determine the transition from case ( c ) to ( d ) , it is worth to investigate the effect of temperature on the observed features , by which we can also test our constant tdos argument . </S>",
    "<S> one expects that , an increase in @xmath62 will result in decrease of the saturation value of @xmath23 which indirectly measures the available states at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the incompressible regions will shrink in their widths at higher temperatures , hence the @xmath3 interval that we observe saturated @xmath23 will also decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to determine qualitatively the transition between case ( c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] plots the temperature dependence of @xmath23 together with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental findings strongly follow our expectations , such that the saturation value decreases ( @xmath63 ) meanwhile subinterval shrinks till the thermal energy overcomes the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we can identify the largest incompressible bulk at @xmath64 for @xmath40 from the maxima of @xmath23 , where the slope traces the spatial extend of the bulk incompressible region . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , the encircling strips decay faster due to thermal broadening of the tdos , which makes easy for electrons to scatter across the incompressible strips , hence become leaky . </S>",
    "<S> similar line of argumentation also holds for @xmath58 , however , for the focused fractional state @xmath59 the maxima shifts to the high field edge of the plateau interval . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this effect to different activation behaviour of the many - body gap . </S>",
    "<S> temperature dependency of @xmath23 completes our experimental investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusion *    we have reported on the bulk transport measurements of a geometrically modified hall bar . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand we experimentally evidenced that it is possible to observe quantized hall effect even if the bulk is not entirely incompressible , however , we simultaneously showed that it is also possible to observe quantized conductance if an incompressible strip resides at the edges preventing scattering between the hall contacts . on the other hand , the incompressible bulk based topological theories are well justified at certain magnetic intervals also for finite size and non - periodically bound systems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we showed that , the incompressible strips narrower than the thermodynamical length scales are prone to become leaky in the plateau - to - plateau transition intervals . for the iqhe , remarkably , there exists only a single incompressible strip with a given integer filling factor , in contradiction to single particle theories . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , note that the berry flux enclosed in real space comprised by the incompressible strip equals to the number of fully occupied landau levels , hence , the chern number is still determining the hall conductance . </S>",
    "<S> new experiments based on the screening theory outlined here would be significantly important to determine interrelation between the topological insulators and quantized hall effect which even could be extended to non - abelian states . </S>"
