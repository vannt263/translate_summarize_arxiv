    "since the first discovery of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of alkali atoms in 1995  @xcite , macroscopic quantum phenomena , which stem from the coherence of the many - body wavefunctions describing becs , have been studied extensively .",
    "systems of a bec in a double - well potential are well suited for exploring various phenomena associated with the coherent nature , and vigorous studies in such systems in recent years have led to the observation of intriguing macroscopic quantum phenomena , such as the matter - wave interference  @xcite and the josephson effects  @xcite .",
    "the coherent nature of bose - condensed atomic gases combined with their diluteness allows for the formulation of the bec systems based on a non - linear schrdinger equation , the so - called gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the static solutions of the gp equation describe a bec not only in the ground state but also in the macroscopically excited states , such as the stationary quantized vortices  @xcite and the standing dark solitons .",
    "in particular , the dark solitons in becs , which share fundamental properties with solitons in the nonlinear optics and the fluid mechanics , have attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "most recently , becker _",
    "et al_.  observed experimentally dark solitons with long lifetime up to several seconds and opened up new possibility of detailed studies of the soliton dynamics  @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical work  @xcite on stability of the dark soliton states in harmonic potentials with axial symmetry found that the dark soliton is stable when the radial confinement is sufficiently strong , i.e. when the bec is quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) . on the other hand , in 3d systems",
    "a dynamical instability , which is called the snake instability , causes the breakdown of the dark soliton , resulting in the formation of vortex rings  @xcite .",
    "the first excited state of a bec in a double - well potential has a density notch and a phase kink at the center of the trap ( see the dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : pistate ] ) .",
    "this state is called @xmath0-state because the phase difference between the left and right condensates is @xmath0 . in the sufficiently large condensate ,",
    "the size of the density notch becomes of the order of the healing length . in this regime ,",
    "the density notch can be regarded as a dark soliton .",
    "stability of the @xmath0-state of quasi-1d becs has been previously studied only in two extreme limits ; it is dynamically stable when the potential barrier is absent  @xcite , while it is dynamically unstable when the potential barrier height is much larger than the chemical potential , i.e. when the two - mode approximation is valid  @xcite .",
    "although the transition from the dynamically stable @xmath0-state to the dynamically unstable @xmath0-state is expected to occur , no work to date has studied the intermediate transition region . in order to identify the transition",

    "first , we calculate the excitation energies of the @xmath0-state by solving the bogoliubov equations numerically .",
    "the critical barrier height , above which the @xmath0-state is dynamically unstable , is determined from the condition of complex excitation energy .",
    "we will show that the critical barrier height decreases monotonically as the number of atoms increases . for comparison , we also calculate the lowest excitation - energy using the two - mode approximation .",
    "this calculation will confirm that the two - mode approximation completely fails to provide the critical barrier height except in the limit of small number of atoms .",
    "secondly , we numerically simulate the dynamics of the @xmath0-state by solving the time - dependent gp equation .",
    "we will find that in the dynamically unstable region the condensate density notch corresponding to the dark soliton oscillates with a large amplitude around the center of the trap , while in the dynamically stable region the dark soliton remains stationary at the trap center during the time evolution .",

    "the reason for the negative energy for this excitation can be easily understood for the case of @xmath56 . in this case , it is clear that the potential energy for the density notch is the highest at the center of the trap .",
    "thus , the deviation of the density notch from the potential maximum lowers the energy , resulting in the negative excitation energy . as @xmath57 increases for a fixed value of @xmath27 , the absolute value of this negative excitation energy decreases because the potential energy for the density notch also decreases . as @xmath57 increases from the critical point , the imaginary part of the excitation energy develops and takes the maximum value at a certain point .",
