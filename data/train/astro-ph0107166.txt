    "rx j0052.1 - 7319 is an x - ray source located in the the small magellanic cloud , first detected with einstein ( 1e 0050.3 - 7335 , @xcite ) .",
    "it was classified by kahabka and pietsch ( 1996 ) as a transient x - ray binary candidate based on the rosat pspc data from october 1991 and april 1992 .    as part of a systematic search of the rosat data for pulsed sources",
    ", we have discovered pulsations from rx j0052.1 - 7319 at a frequency of 65.4 mhz ( period = 15.3 s ) using rosat hri observations from 1996 november - december .",
    "our search had previously detected another smc pulsar , j0117.6 - 7330 ( @xcite ) .",
    "after a preliminary report of our discovery of the pulsar nature of rx j0052.1 - 7319 ( @xcite ) , kahabka estimated a new source position based on hri observations of 1995 may ( @xcite ) , and confirmed the detection of pulsations using an hri observations from october 1996 ( @xcite ) .",
    "israel et al . ( 1999 ) identified a be star as the likely optical counterpart to the source .",
    "udalski ( 1999 ) then reported on the long term optical variability of this candidate , based on optical gravtational lensing experiment ( ogle ) monitoring .    here",
    "we report on the pulsations we detected in the rosat hri data , detection of these pulses in hard x - rays using simultaneous batse data , the history of the outburst visible in the batse data , and optical observations of the candidate companion and nearby stars .",
    "we initially discovered pulsations from rx j0052.1 - 7319 in observations made with the high resolution imager ( hri ) detector of the rosat ( @xcite ) in 1996 november and december .",
    "the hri , which consisted of two cascaded microchannel plates ( mcps ) with a crossed grid position readout system , was sensitive to x - rays in the @xmath0 0.2  2 kev range .",
    "thereafter we detected the pulsations in observations from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) ( @xcite ) on the cgro using data from the large area detectors ( lads ) which are nai scintillation detectors sensitive to hard x - rays / soft gamma - rays in the 20 kev to 2 mev range .",
    "our discovery was made in the rosat hri observations of 1996 november 10.71  december 9.16 as part of a systematic search of the rosat data for previously undetected pulsars .",
    "these data were among 1365 data sets we selected from the catalog of 59911 rosat / hri point source observations based on the potential for detection of significant pulsations .",
    "each data set was processed using standard ftools , with barycentered arrival times for the first 200 ks of each observation binned with 5 ms resolution , and fourier transformed .",
    "the power spectra were searched for significant pulsed signals unassociated with the @xmath05760 s spacecraft orbit or the 402 s period spacecraft orientation wobble .",
    "the rx j0052.1 - 7319 hri observations were selected for further analysis because of a strong signal near 65 mhz .",
    "these hri observations , rh600811n00 and rh600812a01 , are of two smc fields which contain rx j0052.1 - 7319 .",
    "the observations for these two fields are partially contemporaneous .",
    "figure 1 shows the count rates in 1000 s bins for events within @xmath1 of the source in these observations .",
    "the roughly 10 - 20% difference in counting rates between contemporaneous portions of the two observations may be due principally to differences in source vignetting . for observation rh600812a01 ,",
    "the source is @xmath2 from the center of the hri field and vignetting corrections are 10 - 20% ; for observation rh600811n00 the source is @xmath3 from the hri center and vignetting is substantially less . from observation",
    "rh600811n00 it is clear that the source flux is declining .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , the initial 200 ks ( 2.3 days ) interval of the observations , which was used for the initial search fft , contained only a portion of either of the two observations .",
    "we chose for further analysis the data of nov 11.21 - 16.83 ( all of rh600812a01 and the first portion of rh600811n00 ) .    from initial analyses of this dataset we knew pulse frequency was changing significantly , and that there was substantial power at higher harmonics of the pulse frequency . to accurately estimate the pulse frequency and frequency derivitive",
    "we maximized the @xmath4 statistic ( @xcite ) , where @xmath5 , and the rayleigh statistic @xmath6 is calculated as : @xmath7)\\right|^2~.\\ ] ]    here @xmath8 is the number of photons detected in the interval , @xmath9 is the analysis frequency , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the pulse frequency , @xmath12 is a barycentric arrival time of photon @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is an epoch within the data interval .",
    "for epoch mjd 50401.0 ( 1996 nov .",
    "14.0 ) we obtained @xmath11 = 0.06545850(7 ) hz and @xmath15 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath4 was 524 , which is highly improbable by chance .",
    "the rayleigh statistic for this ratio of @xmath16 is shown in figure [ rx_periodogram ] .",
    "in addition to the pulse fundamental , four pulse harmonic overtones are clearly detected .",
    "the hri data from the 1996 november 11.21 - 16.83 interval epoch - folded with this ephemeris is shown in figure [ hri_profile ] .",
    "the pulse profile has a single asymmetric peak , with a narrow valley at minimum .",
    "the pulsed fraction ( [ mean - minimum]/mean ) is @xmath17% .    for the hri data from the interval 1996 december 5 - 9 we obtain a frequency @xmath18hz at epoch mjd 50524.0 , and @xmath19 .",
    "thus the decrease in counting rate noted above was accompanied by a decrease in spin - up rate , as would be expected from the intrinic correlation between mass accretion rate and angular momentum accretion rate in a disk fed accreting pulsar .    for the 1996 november 11 - 16 and december 5 - 9 intervals we find source count rates of 0.92 and 0.46 countss@xmath20 respectively .",
    "these rates are corrected for vignetting ( @xcite ) and the @xmath21 radius circle used to select the data , using the hri off - axis encircled energy profile ( @xcite ) .    to estimate fluxes from these count rates",
    "we have used the spectrum estimated for the source by kahabka & prietsch ( 1996 ) based on a fit of rosat pspc data .",
    "this consists of thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath22 kev , a galactic absorption column of @xmath23 , and an absorption column within the smc with density of @xmath24 ( 95% confidence errors ) , with metallicities reduced by a factor of seven from solar system abundances .",
    "this model results in 0.1 - 2.0 kev unabsorbed flux estimates of @xmath25 and of @xmath26 for the 1996 november 11 - 16 and december 5 - 9 intervals respectively .",
    "using the 1996 november data of observation rh600811n00 , we have determined the position of the source to be r. a. = @xmath27 , dec .",
    "= @xmath28 , with a statistical uncertainty ( @xmath29 ) which is negligible in comparison to systematic position errors , which result in an 68% confidence error circle of radius 7@xmath30 ( @xcite , rosat users handbook ) .",
    "these systematic errors are due to uncertainty in the aspect of rosat .",
    "we note that this position differs by nearly 10 \" from the position quoted by kahabka ( 1999b ) and kahabka ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , since these latter determinations used either very low rate data ( @xmath310.01 c / s ) or data in which the source was at the edge of the hri field of view , we believe that the position given above may be the more accurate .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) was an all sky monitor which flew onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "the data used in the analysis presented here were from the large area detectors ( lads ) which were nai(tl ) scintillation counters 1.27 cm thick , with 2025 @xmath32 area , that were located at the eight corner of the cgro spacecraft .",
    "count rate data from the lads was continuously available from 1991 april to 2000 may , except during saa passages and occasional telemetry outages .",
    "the 20 - 50 kev channel of the batse lad discriminator rates ( discla channel 1 ) were analysed for pulsations from rx j0052.1 - 7319 using techniques discussed in finger et al .",
    "rates were combined from different detectors with coefficients optimal for a source with a spectrum of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 kev .",
    "a large number of pulse profiles are obtained by fitting short segments of these combined rates with a model consisting of a quadratic spline background , plus a low order fourier expansion pulse profile model .",
    "these profiles are then combined over multiple day intervals using trial frequencies and frequency rates .",
    "the resulting combined profiles are evaluated with the @xmath35 statistic ( @xcite ) , which is simular to the @xmath36 statistic , but accounts for possible non - poisson noise .",
    "using data from the interval 1996 nov 11.017.0 , @xmath37 was searched over a frequency range of width @xmath38 hz centered on the rosat measurement , and a frequency rate range of @xmath39 to @xmath40 resulting in maximum value of @xmath41 which we estimate has a probability of being exceeded by chance of less than @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting frequency and frequency rate estimates were @xmath43  hz at epoch mjd 50401.0 , and @xmath44  hz  s@xmath20 , in good agreement with the rosat results .",
    "the batse pulse profile for this interval using the rosat hri ephemeris is shown in figure [ batse_profile ] .",
    "the profile is shown relative to the mean flux level , which can not be determined from the data due to the weakness of the source and the high background level .",
    "the solid curve is the profile corresponding to six fourier coefficients which have been estimated with the same fitting technique used with the frequency search .",
    "error bars for the value of the curve at 13 approximately independent points are shown .",
    "six harmonics were chosen because this approximately matches the 1.024 s resolution of the data .",
    "pulsations were then detected in nine additions six - day intervals , extending the total period the source was detected with batse to 60 days between 1996 september 18 and",
    "november 17 . beginning with the nov 11 - 17 interval , the total period of detection was progressively extended outward by frequency and frequency rate searches in the adjacent six day intervals , using @xmath45 frequency ranges centered on the extrapolation from the neighboring frequency and frequency rate estimate , and the frequency rate range given above .",
    "searching in this manner at the boundaries of the known frequency history reduces the required frequency search range , providing the best sensitivity .",
    "figure [ batse_timing ] shows the resulting measurements of frequency , frequency rate , and r.m.s .",
    "pulsed flux in the 20 - 50 kev energy band .",
    "the figure also shows for comparison the frequency and frequency rate measurements from the rosat hri data .",
    "efforts were made to detect the source from 1996 august 1 to september 18 , and from 1996 november 17 to 1997 january 8 , but these failed .",
    "these attempts used searches with a frequency range of @xmath46hz centered on the nearest detection , and a frequency rate range of @xmath39 to @xmath40 . prior to 1996",
    "september 18 , pulsations from the 130.4 mhz pulsar 4u 1626 - 67 interfered with first harmonic ( i.e. @xmath47 ) contribution to @xmath37 , in a narrow frequency band near 65.2mhz . for this narrow band , this harmonic was left out of the search .",
    "we conclude that in these intervals prior to and following our 1996 september 18 to november 17 detections that the source had pulsed flux below our sensitivity level .",
    "we estimate an upper limit of 8 mcrab for the 20 - 50 kev r.m.s .",
    "pulsed flux for these intervals .      in figure [ v2 ]",
    "we show a v band image taken from south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) 1.0 m telescope on 20 jan 1999 .",
    "marked on the figure is the x - ray error circle of kahabka ( 2000 ) which has a 6 `` radius , and the error circle from this work , with a 7 '' radius .",
    "the object marked a is the source identified as the counterpart by israel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based upon a red spectrum .",
    "the objects labeled a , b , c , and d are also identified in figure [ ha_r ] .",
    "if the optical counterpart of rx j0052.1 - 7319 is a be star , then it should show excess @xmath48 emission .",
    "in figure [ ha_r ] we show @xmath48 versus r band counts for 25 stars in the vicinity of kahabka s x - ray error circle .",
    "the line is a linear best fit through all the data points shown .",
    "stars that lie above the line are ones that show an @xmath48 excess ",
    "i.e. objects a , b and c as identified on figure [ v2 ] .",
    "object d , the one inside the kahabka ( 2000 ) error circle , shows no excess .",
    "objects b and c , though exhibiting an @xmath48 excess , are too far away from the x - ray position to be the counterpart . if , as we might expect , the optical companion is a be star , the only reasonable counterpart is object a , the star identified by isreal et al .",
    "object a is well contained with the error circle for rx j0052.1 - 7319 presented here , and thus the identification of the x - ray source as a member of a be system seems reasonable .    the absolute v magnitude of object a may be determined from the value quoted by udalski ( 1999 ) of @xmath49=14.67 .",
    "the distance modulus to the smc determined by westerlund ( 1997 ) is @xmath50 = 18.9 .",
    "in addition , the average extinction is e(b - v ) = 0.07 - 0.09 ( @xcite ) , though there are regions in the smc where it can rise as high as 0.25 .",
    "combining these parameters leads to an estimate of @xmath51= -4.47@xmath520.02 .",
    "this magnitude corresponds to a star in the range b1iii - b0v , very similar to the value obtained for be / x - ray binary counterparts ( e.g. that of rx j0117.6 - 7330 quoted in coe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the rosat hri observations we have presented show that rx j0052.1 - 7319 is a pulsar with a 65 mhz rotation frequency .",
    "variations in the flux by more than two orders of magnitude between rosat observations at different epochs demonstrates that the source is a transient ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the batse observations we have presented show that the november  december 1996 rosat hri observations occurred on the tail of a outburst that began at least two months earlier , lasting more than 80 days .",
    "the companions of transient pulsars with known spectral type are generally be ( or oe ) stars .",
    "there are now known a few transient pulsars in low - mass x - ray binaries , but these all have high spin frequencies ( @xmath53 hz ) .",
    "be stars show both emission in the balmer lines , and an excess in the ir , due to a disk of material shed from the equator of the rapidly rotating star .",
    "the accretion of this material , which is thought to form a quasi - keplerian disk , fuels the x - ray outbursts .",
    "two types of outbursting behavior are observed in be / pulsar binaries : type i (  normal \" outbursts ) , with a series of lower luminosity ( @xmath54 outbursts occurring once per orbit , generally near periastron ; and type ii (  giant \" outbursts ) , single high luminosity ( @xmath55 sometimes lasting several orbits ( @xcite ) .",
    "these outbursts are generally accompanied by rapid spin - up of the neutron star , indicating disk accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the batse observations presented here are consistent with a giant outburst of a be / pulsar transient in the smc . from the observed spin - up",
    "we can show that a disk is present , and the the source is outside our galaxy . in disk accretion , the angular momentum accreted per unit accreted mass is @xmath56 , were @xmath57 is the neutron star mass , and @xmath58 the radius of the magnetosphere .",
    "the specific angular momentum for wind accretion is generally much less than this , since if it reaches this value , a disk forms .",
    "the magnetospheric radius is limited by the corotation radius @xmath59 , where we have used @xmath60 .",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath61 is proportional to the ratio @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pulsar s luminosity .",
    "since the rate at which angular momentum is accreted is @xmath64 where i is neutron star moment of inertia , and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the neutron star radius , we have the upper limit @xmath67 where we have used a moment of inertia @xmath68 , and a radius @xmath69 . for the nov 11 - 17 observation , for which @xmath70",
    ", this implies @xmath71 , and for peak frequency rate observed we have @xmath72 . using the 0.1 - 2.0 kev flux",
    "@xmath73 observed in the 1996 nov 11 - 17 hri observation , we find the lower limit on the source distance of @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fraction of the luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.0 kev energy band .",
    "this eliminates the possibility that the rx j0052.1 - 7319 is in the foreground of the smc .",
    "the limit in equation [ eqn2 ] is reached only with disk accretion . using the measured frequency rate , fluxes , and the distance of 60 kpc to the smc",
    "we find a ratio of @xmath76 comparable to this limit , suggesting that an accretion disk is present during the outburst .",
    "the pulse periods of be binary pulsars range from 69ms to 1400s , with determined orbital periods ranging from 17 to 250 days . corbet ( 1986 ) showed that the orbital period is correlated with the pulse period . from the observed distribution of spin and orbital periods",
    "we would expect an orbital period in the range of 25  100 days . in giant outbursts of",
    "be / x - ray pulsars we expect a strong correlation of flux and frequency rate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we note however that the history of the frequency rate in fig [ batse_timing ] is dissimilar in profile to that of the pulsed flux",
    ". this could be due to the doppler signature of a binary orbit .",
    "an alternate explanation would be changes in the spectra or pulse fraction .",
    "however , giant outbursts typically have simple flux and intrinsic spin - up rate profiles , with a steady rise to peak , and a somewhat slower fall ( see e.g. @xcite , but also , @xcite ) .    the plausible identification of rx j0052.1 - 7310 as be binary system in the smc accentuates further the rather dramatic difference between the smc and our galaxy with regard to the population of high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this fact has already been noted by several authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "a recent compilation of the known x - ray pulsars gives within the smc one supergiant system , three known be systems , and 11 transients with uncertain companion class ( likely to be be systems ) , making 15 high mass x - ray pulsar binaries . for the galaxy the corresponding number is 40 .",
    "therefore , using a mass ratio of the smc to the galaxy of 1/100 , this suggests that high mass x - ray pulsar systems in the smc are overabundant by roughly a factor of 30 relative to the galaxy .",
    "this analysis ignores the important effects of obscuration within the galaxy , the relative frequency of observations , and the low luminosity sensitivites obtained for the magellantic clouds ; nevertheless the apparent disparity is remarkable .    since high mass x - ray binaries have lifetimes which are a very small fraction ( @xmath77 ) of the age of the galaxy , the dramatic difference between the smc and the galaxy points to a rather recent outburst of star - formation in the smc within the last @xmath78 years .",
    "further support of such an epoch of star formation comes from the radio observations of h1 by stavely - smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and putman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which show a strong bridge of material between the magellanic clouds and between them and our own galaxy . furthermore , stavely - smith et al . have demonstrated the existence of a large number of supershells ( created by multiple supernovae ) of a similar age ( @xmath05 myr ) , strongly suggesting enhanced starbirth has taken place as a result of tidal interactions between these component systems .",
    "consequently it seems very likely that the previous closest approach of the smc to the lmc @xmath79 years ago may have triggered the birth of many new massive stars which have given rise to the current population of hmxbs .",
    "in fact , other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) claim that the presence of large numbers of hmxbs may be the best indication of starburst activity in a system .",
