    "let @xmath3 be @xmath4 points on @xmath0 in general position , and let @xmath5 be an irreducible curve of degree @xmath6 on @xmath7 , passing with multiplicity @xmath8 through the point @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10    cast in the language of seshadri constants , nagata claimed in effect that @xmath11 is the multi - point seshadri constant of @xmath12 , for the line bundle @xmath13 , or equivalently , that @xmath14 is a nef @xmath15-divisor on @xmath16 , the blowup of @xmath7 in @xmath17 points , where @xmath18 is the pullback of a line in @xmath7 and @xmath19 are the exceptional divisors over the blown up points .    the best known bounds for the seshadri constant of @xmath2 points on @xmath7 until very recently were @xmath20 by biran  @xcite and @xmath21 by harbourne and ro  @xcite .",
    "some months ago , ciliberto and miranda  @xcite presented a new method to improve these bounds , and obtained @xmath22 .",
    "their approach relies on the well known fact that nagata s conjecture can be deduced from another conjecture on the dimension of linear systems on @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    let @xmath3 be @xmath17 points on @xmath0 in general position , and let @xmath23 be the blow up of these @xmath17 points .",
    "furthermore , call @xmath18 the divisor class of a line on @xmath0 , and denote the exceptional divisor over @xmath9 with @xmath24 . given a degree @xmath6 and @xmath17 multiplicities",
    "@xmath25 , the linear system @xmath26 has the expected dimension @xmath27 iff there exists no @xmath28-curve @xmath5 on @xmath29 such that @xmath30    linear systems on @xmath7 are often analysed via degenerations : if the degenerated linear system on the central fiber of the @xmath7-degeneration has expected dimension , then nearby fibers inherit this property by semi - continuity . in  @xcite ciliberto and miranda use a degeneration of @xmath7 into a union of @xmath7 and the first hirzebruch surface @xmath31 to check the harbourne - hirschowitz conjecture in a number of cases .",
    "unfortunately , for nagata s conjecture the results do not yield interesting bounds for seshadri constants .",
    "the failure is due to @xmath28-curves which intersect the degenerated linear systems negatively .    in  @xcite",
    "ciliberto and miranda observe that the normal bundle of these `` bad '' @xmath28-curves is negative .",
    "their new idea is to flop these curves , possibly after some blow ups , thus removing them from a new degeneration .",
    "iterating these flops of `` bad '' curves ciliberto and miranda obtain @xmath22 as a lower bound for the seshadri constant of @xmath2 points on @xmath7 .",
    "the main technical difficulty in their calculations is the study of linear systems with small expected dimension .",
    "they require an intricate case - by - case analysis . to avoid this as much as possible this paper uses an approximative approach to nagata s conjecture developped in  @xcite :    [ @xcite ] [ approx - thm ]",
    "let @xmath3 be @xmath4 points on @xmath0 in general position , and let @xmath23 be the blow up of these @xmath17 points . if @xmath32 , @xmath33 , is a sequence of integer pairs , such that the linear system @xmath34 is non - empty of expected dimension , and @xmath35 then the @xmath15-divisor @xmath36 is nef on @xmath29 .",
    "a first attempt to apply this method was made in  @xcite , using dumnicki s reduction algorithm  @xcite , but only led to the uninteresting bound @xmath37 . in this paper",
    "the combination with ciliberto - miranda degenerations yields the new and up to now best known lower bound @xmath38 : compared to @xmath39 this is one decimal closer to @xmath40 .    besides the approximative approach there are two other new ingredients in this paper :    1 .",
    "we consistently use a non - specialty criterion for line bundles , which generalizes the core of harbourne s criterion for linear systems on @xmath7 blown up in several points , in  @xcite .",
    "it also works for hirzebruch surfaces . 2 .   instead of flopping the `` bad '' @xmath28-curves we only blow them up until the exceptional divisor is isomorphic to @xmath41 .",
    "according to the atiyah flop ciliberto and miranda continue blowing down the other fibering of @xmath41 thus really erasing the `` bad '' curve .",
    "but in this way they produce non - normal components , and to prove non - specialty they must again pull back to the blown up components . + to avoid this extra turn",
    "we just modify the degenerated line bundle on the blow up such that its intersection with the `` bad '' curves vanishes .",
    "the central fiber of our degenerations thus contain more components but we still consider this procedure to be more transparent .",
    "in particular it lead us to discover two degenerations underlying the fifth degeneration of ciliberto and miranda , and finally to the new bound @xmath1 .",
    "the steps of the method and the statements proving the correctness are presented in section  [ cm - method - sec ] .",
    "the calculations leading to the new bound @xmath1 are the contents of section  [ cm - deg - sec ] . in the last paragraphs",
    "we show that the next degeneration is considerably more complicated than the previous ones , and we discuss some conditions which would guarantee that the algorithm never terminates",

    "therefore , a more systematic approach tries different inequalities , their effect on the standardization , and finally decide which set of linear inequalities gives the best bound in the end . but",
