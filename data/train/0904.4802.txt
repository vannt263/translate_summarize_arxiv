    "q - balls are nontopological solitonic solutions of a self - interacting complex scalar field theory carrying a conserved global @xmath0 charge",
    ". introduced by coleman in 1985  @xcite , their properties have been extensively studied since then  @xcite .",
    "if on the one hand , volkov and whnert  @xcite showed , in the context of some theories with nonrenormalizable scalar potentials , that there exist particular q - ball configurations possessing nonvanishing angular momentum , now known as `` spinning q - balls '' , on the other hand , dvali , kusenko and shaposhnikov  @xcite proved in the framework of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model that gauge - singlet combinations of squarks and sleptons corresponding to some flat direction of the supersymmetric potential can give rise to q - balls whose charge @xmath1 is some combination of baryon and lepton numbers .",
    "the attractive feature of theses `` supersymmetric q - balls '' is that they could represent the dark matter component of the universe  @xcite ( for reviews on dark matter see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . motivated by this fact , experimental searches for q - balls are being carried out  @xcite , although no compelling evidence for their existence has been reported so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present novel configurations of a charged scalar field describing nonspherically - symmetric supersymmetric q - balls with nonvanishing angular momentum . to our knowledge , _ spinning supersymmetric q - balls _ are the first example of analytical solution in field theory in minkowski spacetime representing a soliton possessing angular momentum . as we will see , spinning supersymmetric q - balls are excitations of spherically - symmetric supersymmetric q - balls , since their energy spectrum lies above the ground state represented by nonspinning q - balls .",
    "however , it is highly probable that these exited states could form during collisions between supersymmetric q - balls and , most importantly , during the process of fragmentation of the affleck - dine condensate , which is a plausible process that can lead to a copious production of q - balls at the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the general properties of spherically - symmetric supersymmetric q - ball in order to make clearer the derivation and the study of nonspherically - symmetric supersymmetric q - balls configurations which will be tackled in section iii . in section iv we show that spinning supersymmetric q - balls are stable against small perturbations about their classical configurations .",
    "finally , in section v we draw our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a charged scalar field @xmath2 whose dynamics is described by lagrangian density @xmath3 being the theory invariant under a global @xmath0 transformation , there exists a conserved noether charge , @xmath4 , which we normalize as @xmath5 where a dot indicates a derivative with respect to time .",

    "an elegant way to construct such a type of solution  @xcite is to introduce a lagrange multiplier @xmath9 associated to @xmath4 , and require that the physical configuration @xmath6 makes the functional @xmath10 \\equiv e + \\omega \\left[q - \\frac{1}{i } \\int \\ !",

    "noticing that the choice  @xcite @xmath11 assures that the total energy @xmath12 is independent on the time , one finds that q - balls solutions have to satisfy the constraints @xmath13 the first two constraints lead to the equations of motion of the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , @xmath16 while the second one is equivalent to the requirement that the charge corresponding to the solution of the equation of motion is equal to @xmath1 : @xmath17 taking into account the equations of motion , the functional @xmath18 can be conveniently re - written as : @xmath19 + \\omega q.\\ ] ] a spherically - symmetric q - ball is defined as the solution @xmath20 of eq .",

    "the coupling of the massive vector - like messenger fields to the gauge multiplets , with coupling constant @xmath23 , leads to the breaking of supersymmetry  @xcite .",

    "the asymptotic expressions of @xmath33 , for small and large @xmath34 are  @xcite : @xmath35 a widely used approximation in constructing q - ball solutions , whose validity has been ascertained in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists in replacing the full potential @xmath33 with its asymptotic expansions ( [ potentialapprox ] ) in which a plateau plays the role of the logarithmic rise for large values of @xmath34 .",
    "more precisely , the approximate supersymmetric potential has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the soft breaking mass and is of order @xmath38  @xcite . within this approximation , it has been shown that the potential @xmath39 allows spherically - symmetric q - ball solutions as the nonperturbative ground state of the model  @xcite .",

    ", we find the value of @xmath41 as a function of the charge : @xmath62 the above relation clarifies the meaning of the critical charge : the q - ball solution we found in the limit @xmath50 , corresponds indeed to the case of large charges compared to @xmath56 .    if the energy @xmath12 of the q - ball at fixed charge @xmath1 is less then @xmath63 , the soliton decays into @xmath1 quanta of the field ( the perturbative spectrum of the theory ) , each of them with mass @xmath64 . instead ,",
    "if @xmath65 the q - ball is said to be classically stable , and then represents the ground state of the theory . using eq .  , we find classical stability , @xmath66 , for @xmath67 , with @xmath68",

    "before concluding , we would like to show that spinning supersymmetric q - balls are stable against small perturbations about their classical configurations . we will closely follow an analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) regarding the stability of q - balls arising in some theories with nonrenormalizable scalar potentials . writing @xmath147 and varying the functional @xmath18 [ defined by eq .  ] with respect to @xmath2 , we find the equation of motion for the field @xmath148 : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the linear differential operator @xmath151 since eq .   is linear in @xmath24 [ due to the form of the potential @xmath152 , see eq .",
    "] , the evolution of small perturbations @xmath153 about the background spinning supersymmetric q - ball configurations is described by a similar equation : @xmath154 the solutions @xmath155 of the above equation are easily found : @xmath156 where @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 being the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath150 : @xmath160 from eq .  , we get that the background solution is unstable [ i.e. @xmath161 grows unboundedly with time ] if there exists a @xmath159 such that @xmath162 < 0 $ ] . however , this is not the case since @xmath163 is real .",
    "in fact , writing eq .   as @xmath164 and remembering that the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath165 are",
    "strictly positive real numbers , we obtain @xmath166 where in the last inequality we used eq .  .",
    "the above equation shows that @xmath163 is a real quantity , as anticipated .",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining , analytically , nontopological solitonic solutions with nonvanishing angular momentum in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime in the theory of a self - interacting complex scalar field carrying a conserved global @xmath0 charge .",
    "this kind of solitons ( known as spinning q - balls ) naturally emerge in a particular class of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at low energy .",
    "the scalar field is in this case a gauge - singlet combination of squarks and sleptons corresponding to some flat direction of the supersymmetric potential , while the conserved global charge is some combination of baryon and lepton numbers . in this class of models",
    "an effective potential for the flat directions arises due to the breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "we have shown that such a type of potential admits , as the nonperturbative ground state of the theory , axisymmetric q - balls whose angular momentum is directed along the axis of symmetry .",
    "working in the limit of large charges , we have found that the state of a _ spinning supersymmetric q - ball _ can be labeled by the triple @xmath167 , where @xmath1 is the conserved @xmath0 charge , @xmath89 is positive integer that can take the values @xmath168 and @xmath169 and defines the parity of the state , @xmath170 , while @xmath79 is a integer which gives the projection of the angular momentum on the axis of symmetry through @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , we have found the expressions for the energy and radius of spinning supersymmetric q - balls , which fully determine their astrophysical and cosmological properties .",
    "it turns out that they do not explicitly depend on @xmath79 and , at fixed charge , are increasing functions of @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates that spinning supersymmetric q - balls are indeed excitations of spherically - symmetric supersymmetric q - balls .",
    "they are classically stable due to conservation of angular momentum and parity and stable against small perturbations about their classical configurations , and could form during collisions between supersymmetric q - balls and/or during the process of fragmentation of the affleck - dine condensate at the end of inflation .",
