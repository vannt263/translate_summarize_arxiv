    "surface plasmons are collective electron excitations that provide unprecedented means for energy concentration , conversion , and transfer at the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "plasmons can be resonantly excited in metal - dielectric nanostructures giving rise to strong oscillating local fields that underpin numerous plasmon - enhanced spectroscopy phenomena , including surface - enhanced raman scattering @xcite , plasmon - enhanced fluorescence and energy transfer @xcite , or plasmonic laser ( spaser ) @xcite . among key characteristics that impact many plasmonics applications @xcite is the plasmon lifetime , which , depending on the plasmonic system size , is governed by several decay mechanisms @xcite . while in large systems",
    ", the plasmon lifetime is mostly limited by radiation @xcite , in systems with characteristic size @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the light speed and frequency , the dominant decay mechanism is excitation of electron - hole ( _ e - h _ ) pairs by the plasmon local field accompanied by phonon and impurity scattering or , for small systems , surface scattering @xcite .",
    "recently , plasmon decay into _ e - h _ pairs has attracted intense interest as a highly efficient way of hot carrier generation and transfer across the interfaces with applications in photovoltaics @xcite and photochemistry @xcite .",
    "plasmon - assisted hot carrier generation is especially efficient in smaller plasmonic systems , where light scattering is relatively weak and extinction is dominated by resonant plasmon absorption . in such systems , carrier excitation is enhanced due to strong surface scattering that provides a new momentum relaxation channel @xcite .    surface - assisted plasmon decay ( landau damping ) has been extensively studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite since the pioneering paper by kawabata and kubo @xcite , who have shown that , for a spherical particle of radius @xmath3 , the surface scattering rate is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electron fermi velocity . in subsequent quantum - mechanical studies carried within random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "@xcite and time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) @xcite approaches , a more complicated picture has emerged involving the role of confining potential and nonlocal effects . these are dominant at the spatial scale @xmath6 that defines the characteristic length for nonlocal effects @xcite ( e.g. , for noble metals , @xmath7 nm in the plasmon frequency range ) , whereas for larger systems with @xmath8 ( i.e. , several nm and larger ) , they mainly affect the overall magnitude of @xmath9 , while preserving intact its size dependence @xcite .",
    "the latter implies that in a wide size range @xmath10 , which includes most plasmonic systems used in applications , the detailed structure of electronic states is unimportant , and the confinement effects can be reasonably described in terms of electron surface scattering , which can be incorporated , along with phonon and impurity scattering , in the metal dielectric function @xmath11 .",
    "here , we adopt the drude dielectric function @xmath12 , where @xmath13 describes interband transitions , @xmath14 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath15 is the scattering rate .",
    "thus , it is expected that , for systems in the above size range , the scattering rate should be modified as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the bulk scattering rate and @xmath18 is the _ surface scattering rate_. in particular , the standard expression , in terms of metal dielectric function , for the plasmon decay rate @xcite , @xmath19^{-1},\\ ] ] should describe plasmon damping due to _ both _ bulk and surface - assisted processes if surface - modified @xmath20 is used instead . for example , for @xmath2 well below the onset of interband transitions , the rate ( [ ld ] ) coincides with ( modified ) drude scattering rate : @xmath21 .",
    "the major roadblock in the way of carrying this program forward has so far been the lack of any quantum - mechanical model for evaluation of @xmath18 in a nanostructure of _ arbitrary _ shape . due to the complexity of electronic states in general - shape confined systems ,",
    "calculations of @xmath18 were performed , within rpa @xcite and tdlda @xcite approaches , only for some simple ( mostly spherical ) geometries . for general shape systems ,",
    "the surface scattering rate was suggested , within the _ classical scattering _ ( cs ) model @xcite , in the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is interpreted as the ballistic scattering length in a classical cavity , while the phenomenological constant @xmath24 accounts for the effects of surface potential , electron spillover , and dielectric environment .",
    "however , the unreasonably wide range of measured @xmath24 ( @xmath25 for spherical particles @xcite ) raised questions about the cs model validity @xcite , while recent measurements of plasmon spectra in nanoshells @xcite , nanoprisms @xcite , nanorods @xcite , and nanodisks @xcite revealed significant discrepancies with its predictions .",
    "furthermore , the cs approach is questionable on physical grounds as well since it involves carrier scattering across the entire system even for @xmath8 , i.e. , when the nonlocal effects are expected to be weak .",
    "on the other hand , surface scattering should depend sensitively on the local fields accelerating the carriers towards the metal - dielectric interface .",
    "this dependence was , in fact , masked in all previous quantum - mechanical studies of simple - shape systems @xcite , where a specific functional form of the local field , appropriate for the given geometry , was adopted , while it is completely missing in the cs approach .",
    "moreover , for the most widely studied spherical geometry , the local field is uniform inside the particle ( apart from surface effects ) , which further obscured its importance .",
    "note , however , that our recent rpa calculations of the surface plasmon lifetime in spherical metal nanoshells with dielectric core @xcite revealed the crucial role of local fields ; for thin shells , the field is pushed out of the metal region , resulting in a reduction of the plasmon decay rate .",
    "this result contrasts sharply with the cs model predictions but , in fact , is consistent with the measured light - scattering spectra of single nanoshells @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent measurements of plasmon spectra in nanorods and nanodisks revealed strong sensitivity of plasmon modes linewidth to the local field polarization relative to the system symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "for general - shape systems , the local field orientation relative to the interface can strongly affect the surface scattering rate , and , therefore , must be properly accounted for in any consistent theory of surface - assisted plasmon decay .    in this paper",
    ", we present a quantum - mechanical theory for surface - assisted _ e - h _ pair excitation by alternating local electric field @xmath26 in metal nanostructures of general shape .",

    "we stress that in a system with dispersive dielectric function , where the mode energy is @xmath44 rather than @xmath27 @xcite , the standard transition rate must by rescaled by the factor @xmath70 @xcite .",

    "however , as we demonstrate in the following section , this difficulty can be bypassed and even turned into an advantage as @xmath51 is derived in a closed form for any nanostructure larger than the nonlocality scale , i.e. , for @xmath8 .",
    "in this section , we derive the surface contribution @xmath51 to the absorbed power due to _ e - h _ pair excitation by alternating local field @xmath26 created in the metal either by plasmons or as a response to an external field .",
    "we start with the transition matrix element @xmath74 , where @xmath62 is the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath75 for an electron with energy @xmath64 in a hard - wall cavity ( this approximation is discussed later ) .",
    "we consider the case when excitation energy @xmath27 is much larger than the electron level spacing , so that , in the absence of phonon and impurity scattering , the electron transition to the state @xmath63 with energy @xmath76 requires momentum transfer to the interface .",
    "a direct evaluation of @xmath71 , so far carried out only for some simple geometries @xcite , requires the knowledge of @xmath77 in the entire system volume .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is our observation that , for an electron in a hard - wall cavity , the boundary contribution to @xmath71 can be extracted as a surface integral of the form , @xmath82^{*}e_{n}(\\bm{s } ) \\nabla_{n}\\psi_{\\beta}(\\bm{s}),\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the wave - function normal derivative at a surface point @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the corresponding normal field component , @xmath86 is the _ e - h _ pair excitation energy , and @xmath87 is the electron mass . the derivation of eq .",

    "however , an explicit expression for @xmath51 in terms of local fields can still be derived by exploiting the difference in the length scales characterizing electron and plasmon excitations .",
    "namely , while the electron wave - functions oscillate with the fermi wave length period @xmath72 , the local fields significantly change on the much larger system scale @xmath73 .",
    "below we outline the main steps of our derivation of @xmath51 and refer to appendix [ app : b ] for details .",

    "the local field @xmath30 is nearly constant , i.e. , @xmath97 , and so @xmath51 takes the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is , for @xmath8 , independent of the surface point @xmath84 .    evaluation of @xmath100 is based upon multiple - reflection expansion for the electron green function @xmath101 in a hard - wall cavity @xcite . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the direct and single - reflection paths provide the dominant contribution , while higher - order reflections are suppressed as powers of @xmath102 ( see appendix [ app : b ] ) , and we obtain @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the free electron green function , and factor 2 reflects equal contributions of direct and reflected paths at a surface point .",
    "it is now easy to see that , for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) peaks in the region @xmath107 and rapidly oscillates outside of it .",
    "this sets up the length scale @xmath28 for correlation function @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ q - surface ] ) and leads to eq .",

    "in fact , both contributions can be combined in the general expression ( [ power - bulk ] ) for absorbed power by modifying the scattering rate in the drude dielectric function @xmath111 as @xmath16 , where @xmath112 is the _ surface scattering rate_. then , the surface contribution @xmath51 , eq .",

    "using our model , surface scattering rates for nanostructure of arbitrary shape can be evaluated directly from the local fields , without further resorting to quantum - mechanical calculations . in this section ,",
    "we employ our main result eq .",
    "( [ rate - ld ] ) to evaluate @xmath18 for some common structures : spherical particles , cylindrical wires , and spheroidal particles ( nanorods and nanodisks ) .",

    "note that recent measurements @xcite in cylinder - shaped nanorods and nanodisks revealed strong polarization dependence of the plasmon spectrum linewidth .",
    "in conclusion , let us discuss the assumptions and approximations we made in deriving the surface scattering rate ( [ rate - surface ] ) .",
    "first , we assumed that the metal nanostructure is characterized by a single metal - dielectric interface .",
    "our model can be straightforwardly extended to systems with two or more interfaces , such as , e.g. , core - shell particles of various shapes or onion - like structures , by including each interface contribution in the matrix element @xmath146 [ see eq . ( [ matrix ] ) ] .",
    "importantly , the surface contribution @xmath51 to the absorbed power , containing @xmath147 [ see eq .",
    "( [ power - rpa ] ) ] , will now include interference terms due to carrier scattering between the interfaces . for two interfaces that are sufficiently close to each other , such interference terms would lead to _ coherent _ oscillations ( quantum beats ) , with the period @xmath28 , of the surface scattering rate with changing interface separation .",
    "such oscillations were recently identified and studied in detail for spherical metal nanoshells with dielectric core @xcite .",
    "we considered systems with characteristic size @xmath23 significantly larger than the nonlocality scale @xmath28 @xcite ( i.e. , with @xmath23 at least several nm large ) , and with electron level spacing much smaller than the optical energy @xmath27 .",
    "correspondingly , we disregarded quantum confinement effects that dominate optical response of small metal clusters . specifically , the large electron level spacing in nanometer - sized clusters leads to oscillatory behavior of the resonance width @xcite ( not to be confused with the above coherent oscillations @xcite ) that should be visible , e.g. , in small aspect ratio behavior of @xmath18 in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "such effects are best described within the tdlda approach @xcite and are out of scope of this paper .",
    "finally , let us discuss the effect of realistic confining potential profile on the surface scattering rate . while the hard - wall approximation is often used for systems larger than several nm @xcite ,",
    "recent tdlda calculations for spherical particles indicate that , even for relatively large systems , deviations of the surface barrier from rectangular shape do affect the overall magnitude of the plasmon decay rate @xcite .",
    "importantly , the potential profile has distinct effects on the rapidly - oscillating electron wave - functions and slowly - varying plasmon local fields , which both determine the transition matrix element ( [ matrix ] ) . while , within tdlda , the kohn - sham wave functions are directly determined by the ( self - consistent ) confining potential , the local fields are , instead , defined solely by the induced charge density via the ( screened ) coulomb potential and , therefore , depend on the confining potential indirectly .",
    "hence , the _ deviation _ of @xmath30 from its classical behavior across the interface is determined by the electron density spillover over the classical ( hard wall ) boundary @xcite , and , therefore , is largely _ independent _ of the system overall shape .",
    "furthermore , recent tdlda studies of relatively large ( up to 10 nm ) nanoparticles revealed @xcite that the main impact on plasmon linewidth comes precisely from the electron density tail and dielectric environment , implying that it is the plasmon local field near the interface , rather than electron wave functions , that chiefly determines the plasmon decay rate magnitude in real structures .",
