    "determining the mechanism accelerating high - energy plasma to the relativistic velocities observed in jets from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and microquasars , and expected in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains a problem whose solution has long been sought in any consistent modelling of these astrophysical objects .",
    "we here show how recent general - relativistic simulations and novel effects of relativistic hydrodynamics can provide important clues in this search .    in crude but",
    "not oversimplified terms , the dynamics of a relativistic hydrodynamic jet in an external medium can be assimilated to the motion of two fluids , one of which is much hotter and at higher ( or equal ) pressure than the other one , and is moving with a large tangential velocity with respect to the cold , slowly moving fluid . in this scenario ,",
    "a blob of hot plasma moving outwards along the jet generically produces a hydrodynamical structure , in the direction perpendicular to the motion , composed of a `` forward '' shock ( moving away from the jet - axis ) and of a `` reverse '' shock ( moving towards the jet - axis ) .",
    "this pattern of waves , which we indicate as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 refers to the reverse shock , @xmath3 to the forward one and @xmath4 to the contact discontinuity between the two , is routinely produced in numerical simulations of relativistic jets . surprisingly however , because unexpected from newtonian hydrodynamics , this pattern can change for sufficiently large tangential velocities and in this case the inward - moving shock is replaced by a rarefaction wave thus producing a @xmath5 pattern . convincing evidence that this process is likely to occur under realistic conditions is now emerging from special relativistic calculations of extragalactic jets  @xcite , as well as from general relativistic , multidimensional simulations of progenitors of short grbs  @xcite .",
    "the latter case is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grbscheme ] which shows the flow - structure produced in numerical simulations involving a thick accretion torus around a black hole and in which a ultrarelativistic outflow is generated .    because disentangling this change in the wave - pattern , first pointed out by  @xcite , and understanding its influence on the complex dynamics of a relativistic jet can be very difficult , we resort to the simplest hydrodynamical flow in which this effect can occur : _",
    "i.e. , _ a riemann problem .",
    "we recall that a riemann problem consists of determining the evolution of a fluid which is composed at some initial time by two uniform states ( _ i.e. , _ a `` left '' and a `` right '' state ) with different and discontinuous hydrodynamical properties : the rest - mass density @xmath6 , the pressure @xmath7 , the specific internal energy @xmath8 , the specific enthalpy @xmath9 and the components of the velocity normal @xmath10 and tangential @xmath11 to the initial discontinuity . using this initial setup and the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics",
    ",  @xcite revealed that , in contrast with what happens in newtonian hydrodynamics , a smooth transition from one wave - pattern to another can be produced by simply varying the velocities which are tangential to the initial discontinuity @xmath11 , while maintaining the initial states unmodified .",
    "more specifically , for each set of initial states there exists a critical value for the initial tangential velocities at which a shock is transformed into a rarefaction wave or viceversa .",
    "the discovery of this relativistic effect is not purely academic and without direct physical implications .",
    "indeed , an important consequence of this change of waves is the possibility of producing a large amplification of the local the lorentz factor @xmath12^{-1/2}$ ] when , past a critical value for the tangential velocity , a shock wave transforms into a rarefaction wave . to illustrate how this can happen in practice it useful to consider a riemann problem with initial states that would mimic the conditions for the generation of a grb or the propagation of a plasma - blob along a relativistic jet ( either extragalactic or in a microquasar )",
    "this can be done in practice by considering a left state which is much hotter , with larger pressure and smaller rest - mass density than the right state .",
    "stated differently , this corresponds to a left state having a much larger specific enthalpy than the right one .",
    "such a choice is justified by the fact that the jet is expected to be very underdense with respect to the external medium ( which could be given , for instance , by a dense accretion torus ) and to be overpressured because a substantial change in the jet radius must happen between its launching site and the location at which it is detected @xmath13 . for grbs , for instance ,",
    "one expects @xmath14 cm , while @xmath15 cm for microquasars and @xmath16 cm for extragalactic jets .    keeping these initial states fixed",
    ", we can then use the tangential velocity in the left state @xmath17 as a free parameter , whose tuning allows to go from one wave - pattern to the other .",
    "more specifically , let us consider the right state to be a cold fluid with a large rest - mass density and essentially at rest , _",
    "i.e. , _ with initial hydrodynamical properties : , , , , where @xmath18 is a normalization constant which allows us to be scale - free . for convenience ,",
    "herafter we will assume @xmath19 and provide explicit values for @xmath18 when discussing the astrophysical implications in sect .",
    "3 . the left state will have comparable but larger pressure , will be underdense , with a small initial tangential velocity and a normal one close to the speed of light , _",
    "i.e. , _ , , , .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem produced by these two states after an arbitrary time is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scs_rcs ] ( we recall that the solution of the riemann problem is self - similar , _",
    "i.e. , _ the structure of the solution in the different waves does not depend on time . ) .",
    "the solution is of type @xmath20 and thus consisting of a shock propagating to the left , of a shock propagating towards the right and of a contact discontinuity at @xmath21 separating the two waves .",
    "this double - shock structure has a well - known newtonian counterpart and is commonly observed in numerical simulations when there is an almost pressure - matching between the jet and the environment .",
    "note that the acceleration at the transition layer between the jet and the external medium is very small and that the lorentz factor reached in the state between the left - propagating shock and the contact discontinuity , @xmath22 , is smaller than the initial lorentz factor in the left state @xmath23 .",
    "this is indicated as @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scs_rcs ] and reaches a value @xmath25 against an initial one in the left state @xmath26 .    while keeping the right state to be the same ,",
    "let us now consider the jet to be considerably over - pressured and with almost no velocity component perpendicular to the jet direction .",
    "the left state can then be parameterized as : , , , , and the solution of the riemann problem in this case is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scs_rcs ] .",
    "this is now of type @xmath27 and consists of a rarefaction wave propagating to the left , of a contact discontinuity at @xmath28 and of a shock propagating towards the right .",
    "this change in wave - pattern is purely relativistic and it is accompanied by a large increase in the lorentz factor across the rarefaction wave , with the maximum value @xmath29 reached at the contact discontinuity .",
    "this is a remarkable feature of relativistic hydrodynamics : namely , the production of a very strong rarefaction near the contact discontinuity _ and _ the combined conservation across such a wave of the specific enthalpy and of the lorentz factor ( _ i.e. , _ of the quantity @xmath30 ) , has the consequence of accelerating the fluid to ultrarelativistic regimes with @xmath31 or larger .",
    "in essence , this boosting mechanism efficiently converts into kinetic energy the work done on the jet by the external medium .",
    "it is worth stressing again that the occurrence of these large fluid accelerations is not the result of peculiar initial conditions in a simplified hydrodynamical flow .",
    "rather , accelerations produced through this effect are a robust feature in numerical simulations of relativistic jets @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the recent simulations of @xcite show that , in spite of the complex multidimensional dynamics produced by the generation and propagation of the jet , the basic feature of this relativistic effect is preserved : _",
    "i.e. , _ the growth of the lorentz factor close to the contact discontinuity separating a high - enthalpy and high - velocity state from a low - enthalpy one .",
    "0.9truecm   1.truecm     as an illustrative example , we report in fig .  [",
    "fig : grb ] results from an axisymmetric simulation in which the ultrarelativistic jet is overpressured with respect to the external medium and its velocity is almost parallel to the jet / external medium interface ( aloy et al .",
    "2005 ) . shown along the polar @xmath32-direction at a distance of @xmath33 cm from the black hole",
    "are the logarithm of the rest - mass density ( dashed line ) and the profile of the lorentz factor ( solid line ) .",
    "the latter , in particular , reaches a maximum @xmath34 in the left - going rarefaction wave moving towards the axis .",
    "these simulations have also revealed that although the interaction between the jet and the external medium is prone to kelvin - helmoltz and shear driven instabilities  @xcite , the growth of the lorentz factor imprinted during the initial phases of the jet propagation , _",
    "i.e. , _ when the jet interacts with the lateral borders of the accretion torus , remains preserved in the subsequent evolution of the flow .",
    "let us now illustrate in detail how the final fluid acceleration depends on the initial conditions by assuming that the right state is held fixed .",
    "in this way , in fact , the transition from one wave - pattern to the other and the boost in the flow depend on two distinct but related factors : the value of the pressure in the left state @xmath35 and the value of the tangential velocity there , @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , it is possible to show that for very small left - state pressures ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath37 for the initial states used above ) the system evolves to produce a riemann structure of the type @xmath1 also when the normal velocity is zero ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath38 ) . on the other hand , for very large left - state pressures",
    "( _ i.e. , _ @xmath39 for initial states used above ) , the system evolves to produce a riemann structure of the type @xmath40 also when the normal velocity is ultrarelativistic ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath41 ) . for all the values of @xmath42 within this range",
    ", a critical normal velocity @xmath43 exists below which the left - propagating shock is replaced by a rarefaction wave and a large boost takes place .",
    "all of this is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl_veln ] , where the maximum values of the lorentz factors are shown as function of the initial value of the normal velocity in the left state @xmath44 ( note that the value of @xmath23 is held fixed so that the increase of @xmath44 corresponds to a decrease of @xmath45 . ) .",
    "different curves refer to different values of the pressure in the left state @xmath42 , with solid lines indicating solutions of the riemann problem of the type @xmath46 , dashed lines to solutions of the type @xmath20 , and filled circles marking the critical normal velocity @xmath43 at which one wave - pattern transforms into the other .",
    "a first important astrophysical implication of the relativistic effects discussed here is that of requiring _",
    "less extreme _ energy contents at the launching sites of relativistic jets and grbs .",
    "this hydrodynamic mechanism , in fact , can boost a fluid to ultrarelativistic regimes very efficiently and thus the lorentz factors either expected or observed in astrophysical sources can be explained with initial `` left - states '' that have considerably smaller pressures and are thus easier to produce in practice ( in case the jet acceleration is mostly driven by pressure gradients ) .    to be more specific , for an ultrarelativistic jet expected in a short grb",
    ", the conditions close to the generation site ( _ i.e. , _ above the poles of a rapidly rotating black hole ) could be associated to a left state with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 [ for a short grb progenitor @xmath51 ( janka et al .",
    "1999 ) ] . in this case , a lorentz factor as small as @xmath52 is sufficient to produce , through the acceleration across the rarefaction wave , the inferred lorentz factors of @xmath53 . furthermore , because the pressure in the jet decreases more rapidly than the pressure in the external medium ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath13 is the distance from the black hole ) the boosting effect will be confined to a region within which @xmath56 . for",
    "a black hole with a mass of @xmath57 this may happen for @xmath58 km .",
    "we also note that if the evolution of these boundary regions is maintained until the afterglow phase , then some differences in the emission properties are to be expected with respect to the standard model of the `` universal '' jet - profile ( _ i.e. , _ a top - hat profile with sharp edges ) or of the `` structured - jet '' model ( _ i.e. , _ where a progressive decay of the energy and of the lorentz factor is expected from the jet core to the external medium ) .",
    "the impact of these structural changes within the jet on the light curve , whose calculation goes beyond the scope of this letter , will help to collect evidence on the occurrence of this relativistic acceleration .    in extragalactic relativistic jets , on the other hand , the lorentz factors are more moderate , with @xmath59  @xcite and the physical conditions",
    "could then be associated to a left state with @xmath60 , @xmath48 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 [ for an extragalactic jet @xmath63 ( ferrari 1998 ) . ] . in this case ,",
    "a lorentz factor @xmath64 is sufficient to produce the observed boosts . in addition , if a continuous channel of plasma is present together with to the detected superluminal ejections , the physical conditions in galactic microquasar jets might be similar to the ones found in extragalactic jets , but with an even smaller inferred value of the lorentz factor ( @xmath65 ; @xcite ) . in this case , values as small as @xmath66 would be sufficient to yield the observed apparent speeds .",
    "a second important astrophysical implication of our results is of pointing out that , under suitable but realistic conditions , ultrarelativistic regimes can be reached _ very close _ to the jet launching site .",
    "furthermore , while the boost originates and is larger in a small region at the interface between the jet and the external material , it is not restricted to a thin boundary layer but can rapidly involve the whole jet .",
    "this is because the left - going rarefaction wave can sweep up the jet material at relativistic speeds and thus rapidly accelerate a considerable mass fraction in the jet .",
    "as an example , on the basis of the values deduced from the riemann problem considered in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scs_rcs ] , more than 10% of the total ( baryonic ) mass is accelerated to @xmath67 in less that 1/5 of the lateral jet - crossing time .",
    "in contrast , in other thermal acceleration mechanisms that also exploit the existence of @xmath68 ( _ e.g. , _ the fireball model for grbs ) some time is needed to speed - up the flow , with ultrarelativistic regimes being reached far from the launching site .",
    "it is important to underline that the boosting mechanism proposed here should not be considered an alternative to the fireball model .",
    "rather , it complements it by providing a more detailed description of the relativistic flows at the launching sites .",
    "indeed , we expect both processes of hydrodynamic acceleration to operate simultaneously , with a longitudinal acceleration being produced by the expansion of a hot gas , and a the lateral one being produced by the relativistic effects discussed here",
    ".    interestingly , this boosting mechanism can also enhance particle acceleration when a turbulent velocity shear layer develops along a parsec - scale jet .",
    "these layers , in fact , whose existence has been pointed out both observationally ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) and through numerical simulations  @xcite , represent natural sites for particle acceleration , providing high - energy cosmic rays and influencing the dynamics of relativistic jets in extragalactic radio sources by forming cosmic - ray cocoons  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the acceleration process in these turbulent shear layers depends on the particle mean - free - path and on the velocity structure  @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that particle production can be further amplified if the simple flow structure usually assumed in these calculations and similar to the one produced in a @xmath1 is instead replaced by a more realistic one , such as the one occurring in a @xmath5 .    as a final remark",
    ", we point out that the large hydrodynamic boosts reported here may be detected with laboratory experiments involving heavy - ion collisions . in these experiments ,",
    "heavy ions are accelerated to ultrarelativistic velocities and collided .",
    "if the two beams are chosen to have different specific enthalpies and to collide with a nonzero impact parameter , an acceleration of the interacting layer could be produced as a result of the relativistic boosting discussed here ."
