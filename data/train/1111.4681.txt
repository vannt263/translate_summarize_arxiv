    "the fermion flows along this magnetic field , and its direction is determined from its chirality .",
    "the topological fluctuation generates a chiral imbalance in some local domain , and then it induces a charged flow of the fermion , or equivalently , an electric current .",
    "when all experimental events are averaged over , the total electric current is zero , but its event - by - event correlation is nonzero .",
    "several theoretical works have studied the chiral magnetic effect in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "these works have tried to measure current - current correlation or charge density distribution . in order to analyze the chiral magnetic effect in this direction ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account topological objects on the lattice , however , it is usually difficult in practice .",
    "we overcome the difficulty by introducing chiral chemical potential , instead of the topological fluctuation .    in this paper , we investigate the chiral magnetic effect in lattice qcd by extending a previous work @xcite .",

    "the naive monte carlo algorithm breaks down at a finite quark number density .",

    "the chiral chemical potential is an interesting possibility to study the finite density matter in lattice qcd .",

    "the data of @xmath29 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 mev ) deviates from the others .",
    "the reason would be that the discretization artifact of the unimproved fermion is sizable at @xmath35 , which is known in the standard lattice qcd at finite temperature .",
    "except for @xmath35 , the induced current is not so sensitive to the temperature .",
    "the induced current is nonzero even below the phase transition temperature @xmath37 mev , i.e. , in the confinement phase .",

    "the induced current is consistent with the analytic formula which is derived from the dirac equation coupled with an external magnetic field . at the quantitative level ,",
    "the induced current is somehow suppressed compared to the analytic formula .",
    "the estimated value of the overall coefficient is @xmath32 - 0.03 even after the continuum extrapolation .",
    "although the systematic effects have been estimated in quenched qcd , the situation will be more or less the same in full qcd . in order to reduce the discretization effect",
    ", we should first introduce the improved fermion action , since the fermion action has a larger discretization error than the gauge action .",
    "more quantitative calculation will shed light on possible qcd corrections to the chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "we have not discussed about chiral symmetry .",
    "since the wilson fermion explicitly breaks chiral symmetry at a finite lattice spacing , we can not analyze chiral symmetry in the present calculation .",

    "the dirac spinor is constructed by mixing spinorless grassmann fields on different lattice sites .",
    "for example , in four dimensions , a four - taste four - component dirac spinor is constructed from @xmath43 lattice sites .",
    "the gamma matrix appears as a direct product @xmath44 of two matrices which act on the spinor space and the taste space , respectively . a naive choice of the staggered dirac operator is @xmath45 with the staggered phase factor @xmath46_{x , y } = ( -1)^{x_1 + \\cdots + x_{\\mu-1 } } \\delta_{x , y } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we consider two types of @xmath47 .",

    "the matrix factor @xmath50 is a product of hopping terms , and thus nonlocal .",
    "this is understood from the fact that the operation of the gamma matrix corresponds to mixing different lattice sites in the staggered fermion .",
    "such a nonlocal dirac operator is expensive for the numerical simulation , especially for the dynamical simulation . for a local realization ,",
    "we take @xmath51_{x , y } = [ \\eta_5]_{x , y } \\equiv ( -1)^{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 } \\delta_{x , y } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this matrix @xmath47 is converted into the taste - nonsinglet matrix @xmath52 . the generator",
    "@xmath52 defines the u(1)@xmath53u(1 ) residual chiral symmetry , i.e. , the exact chiral symmetry of the massless staggered fermion .",
    "the above formulation is based on four tastes , i.e. , four flavors . to implement it in the 2-flavor or ( 2 + 1)-flavor dynamical simulation",
    ", we need to take square root or fourth root of the dirac operator .",
    "the subtle problem arises especially in taking the fourth root .",
    "moreover , since this chiral chemical potential is not taste - singlet , the interpretation of the fourth root is nontrivial .",
    "since the wilson dirac operator ( [ eqdirac ] ) is @xmath12-hermitian , it is straightforward to formulate the domain - wall fermion and the overlap fermion .",
    "this is different from the case of the quark chemical potential , in which the sign function of the non - hermitian matrix must be introduced .",
    "the domain - wall dirac operator is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is similarly defined to eqs .",
    "( [ eqpp ] ) and ( [ eqpm ] ) in the fifth dimension but without the gauge field .",
