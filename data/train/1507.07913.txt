    "hd  177830 ( hip 93746 = wds 19053 + 2555 ) is an evolved k0iv star @xcite that is on the boundary between giants and subgiants @xcite .",
    "it is a nearby star with a distance of 59.0@xmath02.2s pc @xcite .",
    "there have been several age determinations including an age of 3.8@xmath3 gyr @xcite , 4.03 gyr @xcite , 3.28@xmath4 gyr @xcite , and 3.46@xmath00.29 gyr @xcite all of which are consistent .",
    "@xcite measured the diameter of the star interferometrically with the chara array as 2.99@xmath00.39 r@xmath5 and estimated the t@xmath6 as 4804 k. using high resolutions visible spectra , @xcite measured the metallicity , log @xmath7 , t@xmath6 , @xmath8 and then used these parameters to estimate the mass using theoretical isochrones and a bayesian estimation method @xcite .",
    "this resulted in a mass of 1.17@xmath00.10 m@xmath5 , and t@xmath6 as 4752@xmath079 k. @xcite carried out a similar analysis using different input spectra and modeling tools to derive the input parameters , but used the same software to compute masses .",
    "their estimates of 1.37@xmath00.04 m@xmath5 and t@xmath6 of 5058@xmath035 k are slightly different .",
    "the system has been observed with multiple instruments on the spitzer telescope and none of the observations have turned up any evidence of a debris disk @xcite .    by monitoring radial velocity ( rv ) variations , @xcite discovered a planet orbiting hd  177830 with a period of 391.6 days , an eccentricity of 0.41 and an @xmath9 of 1.22m@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass and @xmath12 is the inclination .",
    "this planet was designated hd  177830b .",
    "it orbits the primary at a distance of 0.63 - 1.57 au , and lies inside the habitable zone .",
    "the planetary orbit was updated by @xcite and again by @xcite who also showed the first signs of a second planet in the system .",
    "the star continued to be observed and @xcite published an update of the orbital parameters of hd  177830b and announced the discovery of an inner planet in the system .",
    "this planet , hd  177830c , has a period of 110.9@xmath00.1 days and eccentricity of 0.3@xmath00.1 and an @xmath9 of 0.15@xmath00.02 m@xmath13 .",
    "the updated parameters of hd  177830b are a period of 407.31 days , an eccentricity of 0.009@xmath00.004 and an @xmath9 of 1.48m@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite were able to use the lack of astrometric detection with hipparcos satellite to place an upper limit on the mass of hd  177830b of 225.2 m@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite first reported the discovery of a stellar companion to hd  177830 with a separation of 16 using adaptive optics ( ao ) on the very large telescope .",
    "the stellar companion was designated hd  177830 b , while the primary was designated hd  177830 a. based on near - ir colors and the differential magnitude of 6.6 at 1.6  they estimated the spectral type of hd  177830 b to be m2v ",
    "m5v with a mass of 0.23@xmath00.01 m@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite published an observation of the same companion that predates the discovery images of @xcite using the visible - light ao system on the advanced electro - optical system ( aeos ) telescope .",
    "the astrometry from both papers is shown in table [ results ] .",
    "there have been several prior high angular resolution observations of the hd  177830 .",
    "@xcite used the chara array to search for stellar companions and did not detect the stellar companion because it was outside of the instrument s field of view of 01 .",
    "inside of their field of view , they were able to rule out any additional stellar companions earlier than k0v .",
    "@xcite carried out speckle interferometry observations with the kitt peak 4 m telescope , but the observations did not achieve a sufficient dynamic range to detect the companion .",
    "the stellar companion s measured separation corresponds to a projected separation of 97au and this separation has the potential to have an impact on the dynamical behaviour and evolution of the exoplanets orbiting hd  177830 a. the population of exoplanets in binaries with semimajor axes smaller than 100 au is statistically different than those orbiting single stars @xcite , while for binaries with separations larger than 100 au the frequencies of exoplanets among single stars and components of wide binaries are indistinguishable @xcite . with that in mind",
    ", we carried out observations with two instruments on the palomar 5 m telescope in an effort to understand the orbital parameters of this exoplanet hosting binary star .",
    "hd  177830 was observed with the project 1640 ( p1640 ) coronagraph @xcite on 2012 june 12 ut .",
    "the p1640 coronagraph is integrated with an integral field spectrograph covering the _ yjh _ bands . like pharo",
    ", this instrument is mounted on the palm-3000 ao system .",
    "we collected 3 data cubes , each with an integration time of 549.9 s. for each data cube the primary was placed behind the occulting disk .",
    "the data were reduced using the project 1640 data reduction pipeline @xcite . since",
    "that paper was written , a few upgrades have been made to the pipeline that reduce lenslet - lenslet cross talk .",
    "the pipeline processing produces an image of the object in each of 32 wave bands resulting in a data cube .",
    "while we collected several unocculted images of hd  177830 , the dynamic range between the companion and primary makes it extremely difficult to detect the companion .",
    "two of our occulted images used the astrometric grid spots @xcite .",
    "we fit a gaussian to each of these spots .",
    "then we identified the location of the primary by fitting lines to the vertical and the horizontal spots .",
    "the primary is located where these two lines intersect .",
    "figure [ p1640_image ] shows an image slice with the grid spots .",
    "the final astrometry is the average of the astrometry measured from 26 of the data slices from each of the two data cubes with grid spots .",
    "the frames in the water absorbtion bands with center wavelengths of 1145 nm , 1170 nm , 1395 nm , 1420 nm , 1445 nm and 1795 nm had too low signal to fit a gaussian to the grid spots . the astrometry is presented in table [ results ] , which lists the besselian date of the observation , the position angle ( @xmath14 ) and separation ( @xmath15 ) of the system and the instrument used in the observation .    .",

    "the palm-3000 ao system is a natural guide star system using two deformable mirrors ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "one dm corrects low - amplitude high spatial frequency aberrations , while the other corrects the higher - amplitude low spatial frequency aberrations .",
    "the system is optimized for high contrast observations and routinely produces strehl ratios greater than 80% in the _ ks _ band .",
    "the pharo camera uses a hgcdte hawaii detector for observations between 1 and 2.5  wavelength @xcite .",
    "the camera has multiple filters in two filter wheels and we used the _ ks _ filter to collect 10 frames in 2012 and 50 frames in 2014 . in 2012 , only sky frames were collected for calibration purposes .",
    "past experience with pharo has shown that its flat fields and dark frames are very stable from run to run .",
    "we used calibration data from 2013 to calibrate the 2012 images .",
    "calibration frames were collected on the same night as the 2014 data .",
    "the night of 2014 may 14 ut suffered from high winds resulting in poor seeing and lower image quality than is normal for p3k .",

    "to create a spectrum of the stellar companion , we performed aperture photometry on the images with sufficient s / n in the p1640 data cube .",
    "we used the same techniques that we have used in our previous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this was done with the _ aper.pro _ routine which is part of the idl astrolib and is an adaptation of _ daophot _ @xcite .",
    "a photometry aperture and a sky annulus were centered on the companion .",
    "the radius of the photometry aperture was set equal to 3.5@xmath17 rounded to the nearest pixel size , where @xmath18 is the central wavelength of each image and @xmath19 is the aperture of the telescope .",
    "this corresponds to a radius of 018 at the center of j band and 024 at the center of h band .",
    "the radius of the sky anullus was set to 0.67 ; this is large enough to avoid significant portions of the central psf while also avoiding the occultation spot .",
    "the width of the sky annulus was set to 10 pixels , or 0.19 .",
    "the background was set equal to the average intensity of the pixels in the sky annulus and was subtracted from each pixel in the photometry aperture .",
    "the spectrum is the summed power in each slice as function of wavelength .",
    "code also produces a measurement error bar based on photon statistics and the error in the background estimation .",
    "the extracted spectrum is a convolution of the object spectrum and the spectral response function ( srf ) .",
    "the srf includes the instrumental response and the absorption due to the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we computed the srf by using an unocculted observation of hd  177830  a as a reference source .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of hd  177830  a using the aperture photometry method described above .",
    "then we divided the extracted spectrum by a reference spectrum of the same spectral type .",
    "hd  177830 a is a k0iv .",
    "we did not have a template for this spectral type , instead we used a k0v spectra from the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) spectral library @xcite .",
    "this produces an estimate of the srf .",
    "the companion s measured spectrum is then divided by the srf and yields the calibrated spectrum of the companion .",
    "the portions of the spectrum that overlap with the water bands were removed , as they had large errors .",
    "since the template spectrum had the incorrect luminosity class , we checked to see how much impact the incorrect luminosity class had on the resulting spectra .",
    "we computed the spectrum of hd  177830 b with an srf from hd  129814 ( spectral type g5v ) , taken two nights later at a similar air mass .",
    "the resulting spectrum for hd  177830 b is the same to within the error bars .",
    "the error bars on the final reduced spectra are the combination of the errors of the measured science spectra and the error on the srf .",
    "the srf errors come from the combination of the errors of the measured calibration spectra and the errors on the template spectrum .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion on srfs .    after the spectrum of the companion was extracted from the p1640 data , we compared it against the spectra in the irtf spectral library @xcite .",
    "these include fgkm main sequence stars and lt brown dwarfs .",
    "the template spectra were binned and smoothed in order to produce the equivalent spectra to having the star observed by p1640 .",
    "each spectrum was normalized by its average .",
    "then each template spectrum was compared against the measured spectrum using the sum of the squares of the residual ( ssr ) as a metric ,    @xmath20    where , @xmath21 is the measured spectrum at a given wavelength , @xmath22 is the binned reference spectrum at the same wavelength and @xmath23 is the weight at the wavelength .",
    "the best fit reference spectrum was the one with the minimum value to the metric .",
    "the weights were set equal to the inverse of the computed error at each wavelength point .",
    "the extracted spectrum of hd  177830  b is shown in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "the error bars for each data point are shown in the figure .",
    "the error bars are smallest in the @xmath24-band portion of the spectrum and since the weight of each data point is the inverse of the error bar , this means that the @xmath24-band data are weighted more heavily than the @xmath25-band data .",
    "this is appropriate for several reasons .",
    "the ao performance is improved in the @xmath24-band and produces a higher quality image .",
    "the detector samples the point spread function ( psf ) at a higher spatial frequency in @xmath24-band and finally the coronagraph is optimized for @xmath24-band observations .",
    "this results in a slightly higher contrast in @xmath24-band @xcite and lower errors .    in figure [ spectra ]",
    "we have over plotted the spectra for m2v , m4v , and m6v stars .",
    "the best fit ( via equation [ ssr ] ) for the companion s spectral type is m4v .",
    "figure [ metric ] shows the ssr metric plotted as a function of spectral type .",
    "several adjacent spectral types have similar fitting metric values and their spectra in figure [ spectra ] appear to fit the data almost as well within the error bars . from this",
    "we conclude that the spectral type is m4@xmath01v with a conservative error bar .",
    "this agrees with the earlier photometric determination of m2v ",
    "m5v from @xcite .         plotted as a function of spectral type for hd  177830 .",
    "the units of ssr are arbitrary .",
    "for some spectral types , the irtf spectral library has multiple stars of that class ; this results in multiple data points for several of spectral types .",
    "the best fit spectral type is m4v .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "@xcite concluded that the binary star system had common proper motion . with the additional data from @xcite and this paper ,",
    "that conclusion is strengthened . between 2002 and 2014",
    "the companion moved at a rate of 4.8 mas / yr relative to the primary , while if it was a fixed background star it would have been expected to move -65.92 mas / yr @xcite due to the proper motion of the primary .",
    "this clearly shows that the companion has common proper motion with the primary .",
    "we plot the relative motion in figure [ motion ] . from this",
    "we can tell the bulk of the motion is to the east , but due to the size of the error bars in relationship with the small amount of motion , we can not tell if the companion has an increasing or decreasing declination .",
    "the 2012.4475 data point from p1640 does not line up with the rest of the data .",
    "this is probably due to an error in the plate scale for that instrument .",
    "the separation corresponds to approximately 90 pixels and a 1% error in the plate scale would throw the measurement off .        using the technique of @xcite",
    ", we can constrain the period of the binary . using the equation ,    p^*= ( )",
    "^1/2    where , @xmath26 is the probable period based on kepler s third law , @xmath15 is the measured separation , assumed to be the semi - major axis , @xmath27 is the parallax , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass of each star .",
    "@xcite carried out simulations with random orbital phases and eccentricities and showed that the median ratio of @xmath30 is close to 1 depending slightly on the eccentricity distribution used in the simulations . in all cases ,",
    "the ratio never exceeds 2 .",
    "this results in the ratio of @xmath31 always being less than 3.17 . for the case of hd  177830",
    ", we use the latest separation measurement from table [ results ] , and the hipparcos measured parallax @xcite . for masses",
    ", the spectral type of m4v that we derived for the secondary corresponds to a main sequence mass of 0.2 m@xmath5 @xcite .    as discussed in the introduction , there are two literature estimates of the mass estimates from spectroscopic modeling : 1.17@xmath00.10 m@xmath5 @xcite and 1.37@xmath00.04 m@xmath5 @xcite . since the t@xmath6 derived by @xcite matches the interferometrically derived t@xmath6 of @xcite , we used the mass estimate of @xcite resulting in a period estimate of 829 yrs .",
    "the mass estimate of @xcite produces a period of 771 years .    with a semi - major axis of 100 - 200 au",
    "the stellar companion will not have influenced the formation or dynamical evolution of the exoplanets unless the stellar orbit is extremely eccentric .",
    "there is little evidence that the stellar companion has impacted the dynamics of the exoplanets , with semi - major axes of 1.2218@xmath00.0008 au and 0.5137@xmath00.0003 au .",
    "most of the suggested ways that binary companions interact with exoplanets result in planets with eccentric orbits @xcite or hot jupiters @xcite . in this case , hd  177830 b has a low eccentricity of 0.009@xmath00.004 and appears not to have had its orbit altered by the stellar companion .",
    "the inner planet , hd  177830c , has a low to moderate eccentricity of 0.3 , but since it is inside of the orbit of hd  177830 b , it seems unlikely that the stellar companion would have effected its orbit and not that of hd  177830 b. it is possible that the system has additional undetected planets in outer orbits that have been modified by the gravitational pull of hd  177830 b. it is also possible that the system used to have additional outer planets that were ejected from the system due to interactions with the binary @xcite .",
    "since the eccentricity of hd  177830b is almost zero , the system does not appear to be undergoing a kozai cycle , implying that the relative inclination of the stellar companion s orbit and that of the planets is less than the critical angle of 39.2@xcite .",
    "in addition to hd  177830 , we used p1640 to observe several exoplanet host stars that did not have known companions .",
    "these observations happened during the first phase of the p1640 instrument when it was used with palm-3000 predecessor , palao @xcite .",
    "we did not detect any candidate companions in our 34 field of view .",
