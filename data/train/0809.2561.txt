    "the @xmath0 glueball in pure gauge theory is a well defined quantity that can be used to test our understanding and ability to solve theory .",
    "it is also interesting to understand how , or if , the @xmath0 glueball contributes to the physical light flavour singlet @xmath0 mesons .",
    "finding glueball degrees of freedom in the flavour singlet mesons is complicated , because other non - perturbative objects such as tetraquark , meson molecule or , even quark - antiquark degrees of freedom can also be building blocks of scalar mesons .",
    "there are reviews that discuss these broader issues in more detail  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd is based on a monte carlo process where a statistical sample of vacuum gauge fields is produced . on each sample of the qcd vacuum",
    ", an interpolating operator creates a hadron and after a specific time interval the hadron is destroyed .",
    "the choice of interpolating operator is particularly important for hadrons where it is not clear how the hadron is built out of quarks and gluons .",
    "for example , to create a light flavour singlet @xmath0 hadron , possible interpolating operators are @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a spatial plaquette of gauge fields with @xmath0 symmetry , and @xmath3 is a light quark operator .",
    "the majority of recent lattice qcd calculations that include the dynamics of sea quarks have pion masses as low as 300 mev  @xcite , with a range of volumes and lattice spacings .",
    "these parameters have allowed lattice qcd to make contact with chiral perturbation theory for light pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite . for some quantities , there are now precision results from lattice qcd .",
    "for example the hpqcd collaboration obtained @xmath4 gev for the mass of the charm quark  @xcite . the lhpc collaboration  @xcite computed the nucleon axial charge to be @xmath5 = 1.212(84 ) from unquenched lattice",
    "the low lying glueball spectrum in pure @xmath6 gauge theory was accurately computed nearly ten years ago  @xcite    unfortunately , lattice qcd calculations of scalar mesons are not as accurate as those of other quantities .",
    "the lattice qcd correlators for scalar mesons are more noisy than for @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons , so much higher statistics are required .",
    "the light scalar mesons decay via s - wave decays , and current lattice qcd calculations are in the quark mass regime where some decay channels to two mesons are open .",
    "the results i will present for flavour singlet @xmath0 mesons largely use the last generation of lattice qcd calculations that are quenched , or dynamical qcd calculations with pion masses above 500 mev  @xcite .",
    "the masses of glueballs from quenched qcd are a good test of calculational techniques , such as methods based on a gauge / gravity duality ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "many of these new methods produce results in the large @xmath9 ( number of colors ) limit .",
    "teper and collaborators  @xcite have studied glueballs for different @xmath10 groups on the lattice .",
    "in general they find the @xmath11 corrections to the glueball masses in the large @xmath9 limit to be small .",
    "for example  @xcite the mass of the @xmath12 glueball in units of string tension @xmath13 was found to be @xmath14    some of the methods based on gauge / gravity duality produce results in the strong coupling limit , so it is ( perhaps ) interesting to compare them with older lattice results computed using a strong coupling expansion in @xmath15 .",
    "it is not always easy to get a physical scale from all calculations , so i compare the dimensionless ratio of the mass of the @xmath0 and @xmath16 glueballs in table  [ tb : glueballstrong ] . the black hole and klebanov - strassler results are based on calculations using gauge / gravity that use different metrics .",
    ".glueball ratios from different calculations [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     chen et al .",
    "@xcite and meyer  @xcite have recently computed the matrix element of the energy momentum tensor with glueball states in quenched qcd calculations .",
    "meyer  @xcite uses the computed matrix elements to study @xmath17 radiative decay .",
    "there is `` some '' evidence that the flavour singlet @xmath0 @xmath18 and glueball interpolating operators , in unquenched lattice qcd calculations , are coupling to states around or below 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "although a continuum extrapolation is required for definite results .",
    "unquenched lattice qcd calculations with @xmath0 tetraquark interpolating operators are required to clarify the composition of the lightest @xmath0 resonance .",
