    "several mechanisms govern cooperation among individuals in social dilemma situations such as the prisoner s dilemma game .",
    "upstream reciprocity , also called generalized reciprocity , is one such mechanism in which players help others when they themselves are helped by other players .",
    "it is a form of indirect reciprocity , in which individuals are helped by unknown others and vice versa @xcite .",
    "cooperation based on upstream reciprocity has been observed in various laboratory experiments .",
    "examples include human subjects in variants of the trust game , which is a social dilemma game @xcite , human subjects participating in filling out tedious surveys @xcite , and rats pulling a lever to deliver food to a conspecific @xcite .",
    "even more experimental evidence is available in the field of sociology in the context of social exchange @xcite ( also see @xcite for classical examples of the kula ring ) .",
    "nevertheless , theory and numerical simulations have revealed that upstream reciprocity in isolation does not promote cooperation ( but see barta et al .",
    "@xcite for an exception ) .",
    "upstream reciprocity usually supports cooperation only when combined with another mechanism that can yield cooperation on its own .",
    "cooperation appears when the population size is small @xcite , upstream reciprocity is combined with direct reciprocity or spatial reciprocity @xcite , players move across groups @xcite , players interact assortatively @xcite , or players inhabit heterogeneous networks @xcite .    in their seminal study , boyd and",
    "richerson analyzed an upstream reciprocity game on a directed cycle and showed that it yields cooperation only when the cycle is small @xcite .",
    "the shortest possible cycle with indirect reciprocity consists of three players ( fig .",
    "[ fig : directed triangle ] ) because a cycle composed of two players only involves direct reciprocity .",
    "cooperation is intuitively less likely for longer cycles because a player that helps a unique downstream neighbor on the cycle has to `` trust '' too many intermediary players for their tendency to cooperate before the player eventually receives help .",
    "real social networks are full of short cycles represented by triangles , a feature known as transitivity @xcite or clustering @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural expectation is that larger networks with a high level of clustering ( i.e. , many triangles ) may facilitate cooperation based on upstream reciprocity @xcite . in the present study",
    ", i address this issue theoretically .",
    "i extend the model of boyd and richerson @xcite to general networks and derive the condition under which the unanimity of players using upstream reciprocity is resistant to invasion of defectors .",
    "then , i apply the condition to model networks to show that clustering does little to promote cooperation except in an unrealistic network .",
    "this conclusion holds true for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks , where heterogeneity concerns that in the degree , i.e. , the number of neighbors for a player .",
    "my results seem to contradict previous results for spatial reciprocity in which clustering enhances cooperation in the prisoner s dilemma game @xcite and those for heterogeneous networks in which heterogeneity enhances cooperation in various two - person social dilemma games @xcite and in the upstream reciprocity game @xcite .",
    "these previous models are evolutionary , however , whereas mine and the original model by boyd and richerson @xcite are nonevolutionary and based on the nash equilibrium .",
    "i opted to use a nonevolutionary setting in this study because interpretation of evolutionary games seems elusive for heterogeneous networks @xcite ( see discussion for a more detailed explanation ) .",
    "boyd and richerson proposed a model of upstream reciprocity on the directed cycle @xcite . by analyzing the stability of a unanimous population of cooperative players , they showed that cooperation is unlikely unless the number of players , denoted by @xmath0 , is small .    in their model ,",
    "the players are involved in a type of donation game .",
    "each player may donate to a unique downstream neighbor on a directed cycle at time @xmath1 by paying cost @xmath2 .",
    "the recipient of the donation gains benefit @xmath3 . among the recipients of the donation at @xmath1 ,",
    "those who comply with upstream reciprocity donate to a unique downstream neighbor at @xmath4 by paying cost @xmath5 .",
    "chains of donation are then carried over to downstream players , who may donate to their downstream neighbors at @xmath6 . at @xmath4 , defectors that have received a donation at @xmath1",
    "terminate the chain of donation .",
    "such defectors receive benefit @xmath7 at @xmath1 and lose nothing at @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all players until all the chains of donation terminate .",
    "if all the players perfectly comply with upstream reciprocity , the chains never terminate .",
    "in contrast , if there is at least one defector , all the chains terminate in finite time .    as in iterated games",
    "@xcite , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the probability that the next time step occurs .",
    "we can also interpret @xmath8 as the probability that players complying with upstream reciprocity do donate to their downstream neighbors , such that they erroneously defect with probability @xmath10 in each time step .",
    "each player s payoff is defined as the discounted sum of the payoff over the time horizon . in other words ,",
    "the payoff obtained at time @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) contributes to the summed payoff with weight @xmath13 .",
    "it may be advantageous for a player not to donate to the downstream neighbor to gain benefit @xmath7 without paying cost @xmath5 over the time course .",
    "however , a player that complies with upstream reciprocity may enjoy a large summed payoff if chains of donation persist in the network for a long time .",
    "each player is assumed to be of either classical defector ( cd ; termed unconditional defection in @xcite ) or generous cooperator ( gc ; termed upstream tit - for - tat in @xcite ) . by definition",
    ", a cd does not donate to the downstream neighbor at @xmath1 and refuses to relay the chain of donation received from the upstream neighbor to the downstream neighbor at @xmath14 .",
    "a gc donates at @xmath1 and donates to the downstream neighbor if the gc received a donation from the upstream neighbor in the previous time step .    for this model , boyd and richerson",
    "obtained the condition under which the unanimity of gcs is robust against the invasion of a cd ( i.e. , conversion of one gc into cd ) .",
    "when all players are gc , the summed payoff to one gc is equal to @xmath15 if @xmath16 players are gc and one player is cd , the unique cd s summed payoff is given by @xmath17 therefore , gc is stable against the invasion of cd if the right - hand side of eq .   is larger than that of eq .  , that is , @xmath18 equation   generalizes the result for direct reciprocity @xcite , which corresponds to the case where @xmath19 .",
    "equation   also implies that cooperation is likely if @xmath8 is large .",
    "however , maintaining cooperation is increasingly difficult as @xmath0 increases .",
    "i generalize the boyd - richerson model on a directed cycle to the case of general networks .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 players in which links may be directed or weighted .",
    "i denote the weight of the link from player @xmath20 to @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "i assume that the network is strongly connected , i.e. , any player is reacheable from any other player along directed links .",
    "otherwise , chains of donation starting from some playes never return to them because of the purely structural reason .",
    "in such a network , it would be more difficult to maintain cooperation than in strongly connected networks .",
    "even for strongly connected networks that might accommodate upstream reciprocity , i will show that cooperation is not likely for realistic network structure .",
    "assume that all the players are gc and that each gc starts a chain of donation of unit size at @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the total amount of donation flowing in the network in each time step is equal to @xmath0 . in the steady state , the total amount of donation that each player receives from upstream neighbors is equal to that each player gives to downstream neighbors in each time step .",
    "i denote the total amount of donation that reaches and leaves player @xmath20 by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . in this situation , the amount of donation that player @xmath20 imparts to player @xmath21 in each time step is equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the outdegree of player @xmath20 .",
    "player @xmath20 receives payoff @xmath28 in each time step .    in our previous work @xcite , we assumed that each gc starts a unit flow of donation at @xmath1 . in the present study , however , i wait until the flow reaches the steady state before starting the game at @xmath1 .",
    "the definition of cd for general networks is straightforward ; a cd donates to nobody for @xmath29 .",
    "i extend the concept of gc to the case of general networks as follows . on a directed cycle",

    "the total amount of donation that @xmath20 receives is equal to @xmath31 , which is smaller than @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath20 would give player @xmath34 in the absence of cd @xmath21 , which would be equal to @xmath35 .",
    "an implicit assumption is that the gc can not identify the incoming links along which less donation is received as compared to the case without a cd .",
    "in other words , even if a gc is defected by the cd in the upstream , the gc can not directly retaliate .",
    "instead , the gc distributes the retaliation equally ( i.e. , proportionally to the weight of the link ) to its downstream neighbors .      in this section ,",

    "i use five types of undirected networks generated from four network models .",
    "it would be even more difficult to obtain cooperation in directed networks because undirected networks generally allow more direct reciprocity than directed networks ( see discussion for a more detailed explanation ) .",
    "the regular random graph ( rrg ) is defined as a completely randomly wired network under the restriction that all nodes ( i.e. , players ) have the same degree @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the rrg has low clustering ( i.e. , low triangle density ) and is homogeneous in degree @xcite .    to construct a network from the watts - strogatz ( ws ) model @xcite , nodes are placed in a circle and connected such that each one is adjacent to the @xmath82 closest nodes on each side on the circle",
    "in this way , each node has degree @xmath81 .",
    "a fraction @xmath83 of the links is then rewired , and a selected link preserves one of its end nodes and abandons the other end node .",
    "then , i randomly select a node from the network as the new destination of the rewired link such that self - loops and multiple links are avoided .",
    "i use two cases , one in which @xmath84 and the other in which @xmath83 is small but greater than zero . in both cases ,",
    "the network has a high amount of clustering . when @xmath84 , the network is homogeneous in degree and unrealistic because it has a large average distance between nodes .",
    "when @xmath83 is positive and appropriately small , the degree is narrowly distributed and the network has a small average distance @xcite .    as an example of networks with heterogeneous degree distribution ,",
    "i use the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model .",
    "it has a power - law ( scale - free ) degree distribution @xmath85 , a small average distance , and low level of clustering @xcite .    to probe the effect of triangles in scale - free networks ,",
    "i use a variant of the klemm - eguluz ( ke ) model @xcite . for appropriate parameter values , my variant of the ke model generates scale - free networks with @xmath85 , small average distances , and a high level of clustering .",
    "for a fixed network and a fixed value of cost - to - benefit ratio @xmath86 , the threshold value of @xmath8 above which the unanimity of gc is stable against conversion of player @xmath20 into cd depends on @xmath20 .",
    "i denote this value by @xmath87 .",
    "i determine @xmath80 as the largest value of @xmath87 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this is true because once a certain player @xmath20 turns from gc to cd , other players may be also inclined to turn to cd .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the condition shown in eq .   to the case of multiple cd players .",
    "for example , we can similarly derive the condition under which player @xmath21 turns from gc to cd when player @xmath20 ( @xmath88 ) is cd and all the other @xmath89 players are gc .",
    "for example , on the left - hand side of eq .  , we just need to replace @xmath52 with @xmath90 .",
    "i confirmed for all the following numerical results that once a player turns from gc to cd , some others are also elicited to turn from gc to cd according to the nash criterion and that such a transition from gc to cd cascades until all players are cd .",
    "in loose terms , this phenomenon is reminiscent of models of cascading failure of overloaded networks , which mimic , for example , blackouts on power grids @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath80 and @xmath86 is shown in fig .",

    "the two networks generated from the ws model yield smaller values of @xmath80 than those obtained from the rrg , indicating that the ws model allows more cooperation than the rrg . because the degree distributions of these networks are almost the same and the average distances of the rrg and the ws model with @xmath95 do not differ by much @xcite , i ascribe this difference to clustering .",
    "an abundance of triangles and short cycles in networks ( i.e. , the ws model ) enhances cooperation .",

    "this is in contrast with the results for the evolutionary two - person social dilemma games @xcite and those for the evolutionary upstream reciprocity game @xcite on heterogeneous networks in which scale - free networks promote cooperation .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that players in evolutionary games mimic successful neighbors , whereas in my nash equilibrium model , players judge whether gc or cd is more profitable when the other players do not change the strategies ( see discussion for a more detailed explanation ) .    to probe the reason why cooperation is reduced on scale - free networks , i examine the dependence of the player - wise threshold value , i.e. , @xmath87 for player @xmath20 , on node degree @xmath99 .",

    "however , @xmath104 stays almost constant for the ws and ke models .",
    "at least for these models , an increase in @xmath80 is considered to originate primarily from an increase in @xmath0 , not from changes in the level of clustering .    in fig .",

    "as previously stated , the ws model with @xmath84 is unrealistic because it has a large average distance between pairs of nodes @xcite .",
    "therefore , i conclude that cooperation based on upstream reciprocity is not likely for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks in general .",
    "i generalized the upstream reciprocity model proposed for a directed cycle @xcite to general networks and reached two primary conclusions .",
    "first , cooperation based on upstream reciprocity is not likely in general networks regardless of the abundance of triangles and heterogeneity in the node degree . because the networks that i examined are undirected ,",
    "some amount of direct reciprocity is relevant ; gc neighbors partially retaliate directly against a cd .",
    "my result that cooperation is unlikely for undirected networks implies that cooperation would be even more difficult for directed networks in which direct reciprocity is less available . in directed networks ,",
    "direct reciprocity occurs only on reciprocal links between a pair of players .",
    "second , i showed that scale - free network models allow less cooperation ( i.e. , large @xmath80 ) as compared to networks with homogeneous degree distributions .",
    "this result is opposite of those for two - person social dilemma games @xcite and the upstream reciprocity game @xcite .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that the previous studies assumed evolutionary games and the present study ( and the original model by boyd and richerson @xcite ) is based on nonevolutionary analysis .",
    "i adopted a nonevolutionary setup and examined the condition for the nash equilibrium because the concept of the evolutionary game on heterogeneous networks seems elusive .",
    "evolutionary games on heterogeneous networks imply that a player imitates the strategy of a successful neighbor that is likely to have a different node degree .",
    "however , players with different degrees are involved in essentially different games because the number of times that each player plays the game per generation necessarily depends on the degree .",
    "therefore , for example , a small - degree player can not generally expect a large payoff by mimicking a successful neighbor with a large degree .",
    "in this situation , defining the game and payoff for players with various degrees is complicated @xcite .",
    "use of the nash criterion does not incur this type of problem .",
    "the overall conclusions of the present study are negative .",
    "to explain the occurrence of upstream reciprocity in real societies , it may be advantageous to combine upstream reciprocity with other non - network mechanisms , such as the ones mentioned in the introduction .",
    "i determined @xmath80 by applying the bisection method to eq .   or .",
