    "the classic separation between galaxies and star clusters based on properties such as size and luminosity has become increasingly blurred since the discovery of a family of compact stellar systems @xcite that are intermediate between compact elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , m32 ) and the most massive globular star clusters .",
    "these `` ultra - compact dwarfs '' ( ucds ) , or `` dwarf - globular transition objects '' ( dgtos , @xcite ) , have sizes @xmath7  pc and luminosities of @xmath8  mag , and are of indeterminate origin .",
    "their properties are similar to both the nuclei of low - mass galaxies @xcite , and to massive globular clusters ( gcs ) , suggesting possible connections to both of those populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of current ideas ) .",
    "ucds have so far been found mostly in dense environments , at the centers of galaxy clusters , or near massive galaxies , implying that environmental effects , such as tidal stripping , may play an important role in their formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also possible that ucds formed as compact galaxies at early times when the universe was much denser @xcite , or are simply the massive extension of the gc population @xcite , although ucd kinematics show that the latter is probably not the case in m87 @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", two very massive ucds have been discovered in the nearby virgo cluster .",
    "these ucds , m60-ucd1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s13 ) and m59co ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cm08 ) are among the densest stellar systems in the local universe , comparable to the densest stellar nuclei of local galaxies .",
    "m60-ucd1 had , up until now , the highest density of any known galaxy .",
    "the recent discovery of a massive black hole in m60-ucd1 @xcite raises the possibility that ucds could be a common host of galactic nuclear black holes ( @xcite ; although not necessarily ubiquitous , _ cf . _",
    "the black hole in m60-ucd1 has a high mass fraction ( @xmath9 ) , two orders of magnitude larger than typical values @xcite , which suggests a tidal stripping origin .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the properties of m59-ucd3 , a remarkable ucd associated with the virgo cluster early - type galaxy m59 ( ngc  4621/vcc  1903 ) . while this paper was in the late stages of preparation",
    ", @xcite reported a concurrent discovery of m59-ucd3  using imaging from the sdss and subaru telescopes .",
    "our paper uses independent imaging , and is based on follow - up spectroscopy obtained in 2014 and 2015 .",
    "this study is part of a systematic search for ucds across the entire virgo cluster using the homogeneous imaging of the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ngvs imaged the virgo cluster out to the virial radii of its two main subclusters , for a total sky coverage of 104 deg@xmath10 , in four optical bands ( @xmath11 ) . the ngvs produced two sets of stacked images for each @xmath12 field : a `` long exposure '' stack consisting of images with exposure times from 2055 to 6400 seconds ( depending on the band ) , and a `` short exposure '' stack , consisting of images with exposure times from 40 to 250 seconds .",
    "the long exposure images saturate at @xmath13  mag for point sources , so we use the short exposure images to study compact galaxies and galaxy nuclei .",
    "the methods used to generate catalogs and aperture photometry are similar to those described in @xcite .",
    "we selected ucd candidates based on their colors in the @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 diagram , then fit them with @xcite models convolved with the point spread function ( psf ) using the kingphot  software package @xcite .",
    "the king model fits allow us to determine which objects are extended in appearance .",
    "we identified ngvsj124211.05 + 113841.24 ( m59-ucd3 ) as a bright , extended object @xmath19 to the east of the massive early - type galaxy m59 ( 9.4  kpc at the distance of m59 ) .",
    "there is no hst imaging of m59-ucd3 , so our photometric analysis is based solely on the ngvs images , which had image quality of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath2 of 12.0 and 9.5  pc , respectively , at m59 ) . figure  [ fig : bright_ucds ] shows m59-ucd3  relative to the massive early - type galaxies , m60 ( left ) and m59 ( right ) , and the other bright ucds , m60-ucd1 and m59co .",
    "the radial velocity of m59-ucd3 was measured as 440  @xmath0  in a 320 second exposure obtained on 29 november 2014 with the supernovae integral field spectrograph ( snifs ) on the uh 2.2 m telescope @xcite .",
    "this confirmed that m59-ucd3  is both in the virgo cluster , and likely to be associated with m59 ( @xmath22  @xmath0 , @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to m59 is @xmath23  mpc @xcite , and for the rest of the paper , we assume that m59-ucd3  is at the same distance .",
    "to confirm the snifs radial velocity and obtain a measure of the internal velocity dispersion of m59-ucd3 , on 14 april 2015 , we obtained a 300 second exposure with the keck / deimos spectrograph @xcite using the 600-line grating and the @xmath24-wide long slit , giving a spectral range of @xmath2548009500@xmath26 , a spectral resolution of @xmath27 ( corresponding to @xmath28  @xmath0 ) , and peak signal - to - noise of 107 @xmath29 .",
    "these data were reduced using the @xcite modification of the deimos spec2d pipeline @xcite , and the spectrum was optimally extracted by fitting a gaussian function ( @xmath30  pixels or @xmath31 ) to the spatial intensity profile .",

    "m59-ucd3  has the highest effective surface brightness of the three ucds , with @xmath37  mag arcsec@xmath38 . after correcting for foreground extinction @xcite ,",
    "the total luminosity of m59-ucd3  is @xmath4  mag , or @xmath39 .",
    "we fit the @xmath36-band surface brightness profile of m59-ucd3  with a psf - convolved sersi  profile ( figure  [ fig : profile ] ) . beyond @xmath40 ,",
    "the data show a slight excess above a sersi  model .",
    "the uncertainty in subtracting the light from m59 makes it difficult to ascertain whether m59-ucd3  is better fit by a double - sersi , so we only report results for a single - sersi  fit . unlike for m60-ucd1 ,",
    "m59-ucd3 s ellipticity does not vary much with radius .",
    "the object is fairly round , except at the very center where systematic psf uncertainties dominate .",
    "m59-ucd3  is best fit by a sersi  profile with effective radius , @xmath41 ( @xmath33  pc ) , sersi  index , @xmath42 , and surface brightness at @xmath2 , @xmath43  mag arcsec@xmath38 .",

    "* hereafter n14 ) .",
    "the size we measure for m60-ucd1 ( @xmath34  pc ) is larger than that measured in hst / acs images ( 27  pc ) , although our measurement for m59co is consistent with .",
    "our @xmath2 estimates may be biased toward larger sizes , given the larger psf in the ngvs data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath2 may be affected by the details of subtracting light from m60 .",
    "this is why we perform a relative comparison of all three ucds using the same images and same fitting software , as relative measurements are more reliable .",
    "even if we adopt the smaller size value for m60-ucd1 , it would still have a lower effective surface brightness than m59-ucd3 .",
    "using our keck / deimos spectrum , we measured the line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion with the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) software of @xcite , which fits a broadened combination of stellar templates with different weights .",
    "we used 31 stellar templates with spectral types from b to m , observed previously with deimos using the same grating .",
    "because sources can be mis - centered on the slit , we applied a velocity correction using the atmospheric a and b absorption bands , whose centers depend on how the source illuminates the slit .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of m59-ucd3  is @xmath44  @xmath0 , and the integrated velocity dispersion is @xmath45  @xmath0 . as a consistency check , we also measured the velocity dispersion of m59co , which we observed simultaneously with m59-ucd3  through the same slit .",
    "our measurement of @xmath46  @xmath0  is consistent with that of , who reported a value of @xmath47  @xmath0 .",
    "we estimate the mass of m59-ucd3  using a spherical isotropic jeans equation analysis .",
    "we deproject the best - fit sersi  profile , assume mass follows light , derive the projected dispersion profile , convolving both the model dispersion and luminosity profiles with a moffat psf ( fwhm@xmath48 ) .",
    "we then apply a @xmath24-wide slit to our model to simulate the observed integrated velocity dispersion . matching our observed dispersion",

    "our model gives an average velocity dispersion within @xmath2 of @xmath53  @xmath0 .",

    "the age is fixed to the oldest model available because h@xmath56 is outside the model grid .",

    "we compare the mgb and @xmath59 indices to 14  gyr ssp models to obtain [ @xmath54fe]@xmath60 . for these ssp parameter values ,",
    "the models provide a stellar @xmath61 for a kroupa imf or @xmath62 for a salpeter imf .",
    "m59-ucd3  has a dynamical @xmath63 between the @xmath64 values derived from ssp models using kroupa and salpeter imfs , and could be consistent with either , within the uncertainties .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of m59-ucd3  using sdss and subaru imaging , and spectroscopy from soar / goodman .",
    "they reported @xmath65 photometry , a size of @xmath66  pc , a radial velocity @xmath67  @xmath0 , and ssp age and abundances .",
    "the photometry between our two studies for common filters ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) is consistent , as are the sizes , and the derived values of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath54fe ] .",
    "our age estimate ( 14  gyr ) is larger than theirs ( @xmath70  gyr ) , but the model grids at old ages are closely spaced and this discrepancy is not alarming , although merits further investigation .",
    "our radial velocity is 74  @xmath0  higher , a significant difference that is difficult to explain given the high @xmath71 of both of our observations .",
    "@xcite do not report a velocity dispersion .",
    "m59-ucd3  is the most extreme object of its type discovered to date , although it is basically similar to m60-ucd1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rh_mag ] shows the location of dynamically hot stellar systems , mostly in the virgo cluster , in the parameter space of size ( @xmath2 ) , effective @xmath72-band surface brightness ( @xmath73 ) , and @xmath72-band luminosity ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the three luminous ucds in m59 and m60 are more luminous than other ucds in virgo , but they are significantly more compact than objects categorized as `` compact ellipticals '' ( ces ) , which typically have @xmath75  pc . lines of constant @xmath73 show that m59-ucd3  is one of the densest galaxies known .",
    "these luminous ucds appear to bridge the parameter space between massive star clusters and compact galaxies , further blurring the boundary between the two classes .",
    "the only objects in virgo that approach or exceed the effective surface density of m59-ucd3  are nuclear star clusters ( which may have brighter @xmath72-band fluxes due to rejuvenated stellar populations ) and some of the most massive gcs .",
    "the total effective surface mass density ( @xmath76 , mass density within @xmath77 ) is @xmath3 , which is roughly the maximum @xmath76 observed anywhere in the universe .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , finding these extremely dense systems can illuminate the physical feedback processes that limit the density of stellar systems . finding more ucds in other environments will help disentangle the relationships between these families of objects .",
    "if ucds are the compact remnants of relatively recent tidal stripping events , we may find stripped stellar material in their vicinities .",
    "there has been little evidence of tidal debris linked to ucds ( with a few exceptions , _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , but simulations show that the window of time during which tidally stripped starlight would be visible with current facilities is relatively short @xcite . given the high mass and metallicity of m59-ucd3 ,",
    "however , any stripped progenitor could be very massive , leaving a significant amount of debris .",
    "the average present - day stellar mass fraction of nuclear star clusters in early - type galaxies is of order @xmath78 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if this was true for a system that once hosted m59-ucd3 , then the progenitor galaxy would have had a stellar mass of @xmath79 , or about 15% the mass of m59 .",
    "this logic , however , is uncertain in a few ways : 1 ) the @xmath80 scatter in nuclear mass fraction is a factor @xmath81 , 2 ) this fraction is largely defined by lower mass nuclei , and 3 ) present - day ucds may not be equivalent to today s nuclear star clusters , but may instead combine a nuclear component with a stripped bulge - like component .",
    "we searched for fine structure and tidal streams around m59 that could be associated with either m59-ucd3 , or m59co .",
    "we used the long exposure ngvs @xmath36-band image reduced with the elixir - lsb pipeline @xcite , and subtracted an elliptical isophotal model of m59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stream ] shows the model - subtracted image .",
    "the cross - shaped residual is typical in galaxies that show significant diskiness , such as m59 .",
    "what we find notable is the broad linear feature to the south of m59 , which extends for at least @xmath82 , or 14  kpc at the distance of m59 .",
    "this `` plume '' has @xmath83  mag arcsec@xmath38 , which is 1  mag above the detection threshold for ngvs images ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  18 ) . if extended toward the inner regions of m59 , the plume roughly lines up with m59-ucd3 .",
    "although it is possibile the plume is associated with the nearby irregular galaxy ic  3665 ( vcc  1890 ) to the southwest , its existence in the vicinity of m59 and m59-ucd3  suggests a common origin with the larger galaxy .",
    "we mask bright sources and median bin the image by @xmath84 pixels ( following @xcite ) , and measure photometry of the `` plume '' along the length of the line shown in figure  [ fig : stream ] , avoiding the residuals in the inner region , and using sky regions alongside the feature .",
    "the total magnitude is @xmath85  mag , which at m59 s distance corresponds to @xmath86  mag ( @xmath39 ) , and is comparable to m59-ucd3  itself . the quoted uncertainty is for random errors , but we found that selecting different sky regions around the plume , or using different isophotal model subtractions of m59 , can change the measured brightness by a few tenths of a magnitude . a similar measurement in the @xmath87-band yields @xmath88  mag and @xmath89  mag , which is consistent with the colors of m59-ucd3  and m59 , within the uncertainties .",
    "if associated with m59-ucd3 , the luminosity of this plume would be a lower - limit on the amount of material stripped from m59-ucd3 s progenitor .",
    "although significant mass could be hidden at lower surface brightnesses , hiding 12 orders of magnitude more mass would require it to be spread over 10100 times more area .",
    "it seems more likely that either m59-ucd3  was a high fraction of its progenitor s total stellar mass , the stripping happened a long time ago , or m59-ucd3  was originally formed compact and dense . measuring the mass of any central black hole in m59-ucd3  could help differentiate these scenarios .",
    "we report on the properties of m59-ucd3 , the most massive ucd in the virgo cluster and the densest galaxy known , with @xmath4  mag and @xmath90  pc .",
    "m59-ucd3  has a dynamical mass of @xmath91 , and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath92 .",
    "this @xmath55 is consistent with that expected for an old ( 14  gyr ) , metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath58 , [ @xmath54fe]@xmath60 ) stellar population with an imf intermediate between kroupa and salpeter . given the discovery of a supermassive black hole in m60-ucd1 , m59-ucd3  is also likely to harbor one .",
    "this object , and nearby m60-ucd1 , are likely to be a class of objects that is intermediate between lower mass ucds and more massive and larger ces .",
    "we identify a tidal stream to the south of m59 whose length roughly aligns with the direction of m59-ucd3 .",
    "the measured luminosity of this stream ( @xmath86  mag ) , if associated with m59-ucd3 , provides a lower limit on the luminosity of stars that have been stripped .",
    "this relatively small amount of stellar light implies that m59-ucd3  may not be simply a `` naked '' nuclear star cluster , but the remnant of a stripped bulge or pure - sersi  galaxy .",
    "future searches for a central black hole and for tidal debris at lower surface brightness levels would help illuminate the nature of m59-ucd3  and the class of objects it represents .",
