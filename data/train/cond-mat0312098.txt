    "they include electrostatic interactions between the surface , monomers and salt ions , excluded - volume interactions between monomers and entropy considerations .",
    "although a full description of polyelectrolytes is still lacking at present , several approaches exist and use different types of approximations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these include linearized mean - field equations @xcite , numerical solutions of non - linear the mean - field equations @xcite , scaling considerations @xcite , multi - stern layers of discrete lattice models @xcite and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "experimental studies @xcite have shown that adsorbing polyelectrolytes ( pes ) may carry a charge greater than that of the bare surface , so that the overall surface - polyelectrolyte complex has a charge opposite to that of the bare charged surface .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ overcharging _ ( or surface charge _ overcompensation _ ) by the pe chains .",
    "when the overcharging is large enough to completely reverse the bare surface charge , the resulting charge surplus of the complex can be used to attract a second type of polyelectrolyte having an opposite charge to that of the first polyelectrolyte layer . eventually , by repeating this process ,",
    "a complex structure of alternating layers of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes can be formed .",

    ", profiles of monomer concentration and electrostatic potential have been calculated from numerical solution of the mean - field equations .",
    "several scaling laws have been proposed and the possibility of a weak overcharging in low salt condition has been demonstrated . in a related work  @xcite we presented simple scaling laws resulting from the same mean - field equations and for the same chemically repulsive surfaces . in particular , we addressed the adsorption - depletion crossover as function of added salt .",

    "these chemical interactions are found to play a crucial role in the overcharging , showing that a necessary condition for the formation of multilayers is a chemical attraction of non - electrostatic origin ( complexation ) between the two types of pe chains as well as between the pe and the charged surface . for chemically attractive surfaces",

    ".    for chemical attractive surfaces we rely on a boundary condition often used @xcite for neutral polymer chains : @xmath40 where @xmath41 has units of length and is inversely proportional to the strength of non - electrostatic interactions of the pes with the surface .",
    "the limit of @xmath42 is the _ indifferent _",
    "( non - interacting ) surface limit , while the previous limit of a strong repulsive surface is obtained by a small and negative @xmath41 .    in the following sections we present our results , first for the chemically attractive surface and then for the chemically repulsive one .",
    "in this section we restrict the attention to surfaces that attract the polymer in a non - electrostatic ( short range ) fashion .",
    "for example , a possible realization can be a system containing pe chains with hydrophobic groups ( like polystyrene sulfonate ) that are attracted to a hydrophobic surface , like the water - air interface .",
    "the short range attraction is modeled by a surface interaction in a similar way that is used extensively for neutral polymers via a boundary condition on the polymer order parameter at the surface @xmath16 :    @xmath43    where the length @xmath41 was introduced in sec .  ii and is inversely proportional to the strength of the surface interaction .",

    "the latter will be washed away when the surface is placed in a clean aqueous solution and does not participate in the effective pe surface build - up .",
    "another important quantity to be used throughout this paper is the overcharging parameter defined as the excess of pe charge over that of the bare surface charge per unit area , @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the _ induced _ surface charge density calculated from the fixed surface potential ( @xmath50 ) in units of @xmath11 , the electron charge .",
