    "on february 28 , 1997 , the first x - ray afterglow of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) was detected , leading to the identification of its progenitor at cosmological distances  @xcite . in a few days ,",

    "this burst is the longest and the most energetic among those grbs with detected high - energy emission so far ; ( 2 ) @xcite revealed a high - energy component of grb  941017 temporally and spectrally different from the low - energy component .    in the fireball model ,",
    "synchrotron emission of shock - accelerated electrons is commonly thought to produce prompt @xmath3-ray emission as well as afterglow emission at lower energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is natural to expect that these photons are inverse - compton up - scattered by electrons , giving rise to a higher energy component peaking at sub - gev to tev energies  @xcite .",
    "when electrons scatter the self - emitting synchrotron photons , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission is resulted . in the external shock scenario ,",
    "the temporal profile of the ssc emission from forward shock electrons is similar to that of the low energy afterglow emission and no significant time lag is expected .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite , thanks to its rapid response time and accurate localization , has started a new era of research on grbs .",
    "different modifications to the standard afterglow model are put forward to explain the peculiar behaviors exhibited in the x - ray light curves , in particular the shallow declining phase  @xcite .",

    "lat can also detect very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath5100  gev ) afterglow emission .",

    ", one needs to calculate the forward shock emission ( both synchrotron and ssc emission of the shocked electrons ) carefully .",
    "the attenuation of vhe photons by the cosmic infrared background is also taken into account.since the attenuation effect for photons with an energy @xmath5100 gev is more severe for high - redshift grbs , we limit our grb sample to nearby events .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sect_afterglow_modeling ] , we describe the grb afterglow model , introduce the code that is used in the afterglow modeling and the calculation of the ssc emission from grb forward shock . in  [ sect_model_prediction ] , we present the expected results of the ssc model using reasonable parameter values for grbs . in  [ sect_vheafterglow_fromnearbygrbs ] , we describe the grb sample which includes six nearby grbs with sufficient multi - wavelength afterglow data and predict their corrected energy flux after the attenuation by the cosmic background during the afterglow phase , which is then compared with the available observational data .",

    "while synchrotron emission is widely considered to be responsible for the radio , optical , and x - ray afterglows  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , inverse compton scattering of forward shock photons is considered in details by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "inverse compton scattering may considerably change the temporal and spectral behavior of grb afterglows , and its cooling effect on electrons accelerated in external shocks will contribute to the photon spectra at sub - gev to tev energy range  @xcite .    in the afterglow model , both synchrotron emission and inverse compton emission",
    "are taken into account .",
    "it is assumed that : ( 1 ) the external medium is homogenous with a density @xmath8 or a wind profile @xmath9 ; ( 2 ) the relativistic jet is uniform , i.e. energy per solid angle is independent of direction within the jet ; ( 3 ) the shock parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , fractions of the shock energy given to the electrons and the magnetic field , respectively ) are constant ; ( 4 ) the energy distribution of electrons accelerated in shocks follows @xmath12 ; ( 5 ) the possible achromatic flattening in the afterglow light curve is due to energy injection in the form @xmath13  @xcite or @xmath14^{-1}$ ] with @xmath15 being the initial spin - down time scale  @xcite .",
    "the parameters involved in this afterglow model include : @xmath16 ( the initial isotropic outflow energy ) , @xmath17 ( the initial half - angle of the jet ) , @xmath8 ( the density of the homogeneous external medium ) or @xmath18 ( the wind parameter ) , @xmath19 ( the power - law index of energy distribution of shock - accelerated electrons ) , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( shock parameters ) . in the case where energy injection is necessary , three additional parameters : @xmath22 ( the injected luminosity in the rest frame ) , the timescale of energy injection and @xmath23 , are included .",

    "the reverse shock emission , predicted in the fireball model but not detected in most events @xcite , is not taken into account .",
    "the key treatments  ( see  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) are as follows : ( i ) the dynamical evolution of the outflow is followed using the formulae in  @xcite , which describes the hydrodynamics in both relativistic and non - relativistic phases .",
    "( ii ) the arbitrary assumption that the distribution of shocked electrons is always in a quasi - stationary state is considered to be unsatisfactory and the energy distribution of electrons is calculated by solving the continuity equation with the power - law source function q = k@xmath24 , normalized by a local injection rate  @xcite .",

    "( iv ) the klein - nishina correction of the inverse compton emission has been included .",
    "( v ) energy injection into the outflow is considered necessary in reproducing some multi - frequency afterglow data of some grbs .",

    "for photons with energy higher than @xmath42  gev , the attenuation due to interaction with background photons is significant if the source has a high redshift .",

    "to predict the vhe afterglow emission of nearby grbs and compare the calculated results with sensitivity of different @xmath3-ray telescopes , grbs in our sample must satisfy : nearby events to alleviate the attenuation effect ; at least two independent waveband low - energy afterglows are recorded to get relatively constrained parameters ; the low - energy afterglow can be reproduced according to the afterglow model .    in this work ,",

    "possible vhe @xmath3-ray emission initiated from protons has been suggested  @xcite . however , the proton - synchrotron component , as well as the hadron - related photo - meson electromagnetic components , is in most cases overshadowed by the ssc component of electrons in the afterglow phase .",

    "additional ic component will play a role and will enhance any vhe emission .",

    "the ssc radiation of the late internal shocks or the external inverse compton radiation in the external forward shock front may be able to give rise to some vhe emission signals ( see fan & piran 2008 for a review ) .",
    "however , no  central engine afterglow \" emission has been reported in the late afterglow phase for the six bursts we studied .",
    "so it is hard for us to estimate its ability to enhance the detectability of the vhe emission .",

    "the rate of such nearby and energetic grbs is very uncertain .",
    "grb  940217 might have been another event of this kind  @xcite .",
    "several factors that reduce the chance of detecting vhe photons can be summarized as follows : firstly , as a result of large zenith angles ( e.g. , 60@xmath55 for grb  030329 ) , the energy thresholds of some observations are relatively high ( @xmath21.4  tev ) .",
    "any vhe photon is severely attenuated by the cosmic infrared background , unless the level is very low .",
    "secondly , the observations were taken at very late epochs , e.g. 11.5 days after the burst for h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of grb  030329 , when expected vhe flux had largely decayed .",
    "thirdly , the fraction of low - redshift grbs is small , e.g. see the catalogue in @xcite . for grb  051221a",
    "( at @xmath68 ) studied here , the attenuation is severe at energies @xmath69200 gev .",
    "despite these practical limitations , detection of vhe afterglow emission of grbs is probable .",
    "those grbs close enough ( z@xmath430.5 ) and with an intrinsic high luminosity ( like grb  030329 ) , can be detected above @xmath2200 gev when the observation is taken within @xmath210  hours after the burst . from eq .",
    "1 , grbs with low @xmath70 , large @xmath71 , large @xmath10 , and small @xmath11 are more likely to be detected in the vhe band .",
    "besides , in general the expected vhe afterglow flux decays as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is at least one .",
    "thus , observations with shorter delay are more likely to probe the predicted vhe emission .    _",
    "the main purpose of this work is to provide a relatively reliable prediction of the detectability of the vhe emission from nearby grbs_. it is also interesting to explore the role of the vhe afterglow emission detection in revealing the grb physics .",
    "perhaps the most robust conclusion is that the vhe emission in late afterglow phase can not be attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the forward shock , for which the maximal photon energy is @xmath74 @xcite , where @xmath64 is the bulk lorentz factor of the decelerating outflow . in general , for @xmath75 , the inverse compton emission is expected to be very weak .",
    "so the detection of vhe afterglow emission from grbs requires that @xmath76 , in support of the current radio / optical / x - ray afterglow modeling ( e.g. , see tab.1 ) . together with _",
    ", agile , fgst and some ground - based optical telescopes , ground - based @xmath3-ray detectors can provide us continuous spectra in the optical to tev energy band during the afterglow phase .",
    "a self - consistent modeling of these data in a very wide energy band , in principle , will impose very tight constraint on the physical parameters and on the environment .",
    "however , given the small number of the vhe photons expected from a single burst , we do not expect that the vhe emission can help us a lot to achieve such goals .",
    "in this work , we discuss the prospect of detecting vhe @xmath3-rays with current ground - based detectors in the late afterglow phase . during this phase ,",
    "the dominant radiation process in the vhe @xmath3-ray regime is the ssc emission from the forward shock electrons .",
    "klein - nishina effects and attenuation by the cosmic infrared background , both known to suppress the vhe @xmath3-ray spectra , were taken into account . to minimize the attenuation effect , we chose a sample of six nearby grbs in this study .",
    "we have calculated the detailed ssc emission numerically using the model developed by  @xcite , with a set of parameters which are able to reproduce the available multi - wavelength afterglow light curves .",
    "the results are consistent with the upper limits obtained using vhe observations of grb  030329 , grb  050509b , and grb  060505 . moreover , assuming observations taken 10  hours after the burst , the vhe signal predicted from five grbs is below the sensitivity level of a current sensitive atmospheric cherenkov detectors mainly due to the low fluence of these outflows . for those bright and nearby bursts like grb  030329 , a vhe detection is possible even with a delayed observation time of @xmath210  hours .",

    "<S> such high energy photons are rare and are attenuated by the cosmic infrared background before reaching us . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the prospect to detect these vhe photons using the current ground - based cherenkov detectors . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated results are consistent with the upper limits obtained with several cherenkov detectors for grb  030329 , grb  050509b , and grb  060505 during the afterglow phase . for 5 bursts in our nearby grb sample </S>",
    "<S> ( except for grb  030329 ) , current ground - based cherenkov detectors would not be expected to detect the modeled vhe signal . only for those very bright and nearby bursts like grb  030329 , detection of vhe photons is possible under favorable observing conditions and a delayed observation time of @xmath110  hours . </S>"
