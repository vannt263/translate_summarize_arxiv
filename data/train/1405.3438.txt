    "the equation of state ( eos ) of superdense matter is one of the key questions in astrophysics and nuclear physics .",
    "neutron stars ( nss , hereafter , ns refers to all kinds of pulsar - like compact objects . ) in the universe provide us an unique opportunity to approach it .",
    "generally , two categories of eos were widely discussed , which can produce gravity - bound ns and self - bound ns @xcite , respectively .",
    "all of them proposed distinct mass - radius relations .",
    "the eoss of self - bound ns predicted @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and radius of ns ) for low mass ns .",
    "moreover , the minimum mass of self - bound ns can reach as low as planet - mass @xcite , while the low limit mass of gravity - bound ns is about @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of the radius and mass of ns , as well as searching extremely low mass ns can provide useful information to test various theoretical eoss .",
    "the mass of ns can be precisely determined in double ns system or white dwarf  neutron star system ( see @xcite for all nss with measured masses ) . especially , @xcite found a very low mass ns ( @xmath8 at 95.4% confidence ) in , which might be the least massive compact object in double ns system .",
    "the direct measurement of the radius of ns , however , is still difficult .",
    "the measurement of ns radius is very critical for eos constraining .",
    "@xcite claimed that the nss with mass in the range @xmath9 should be larger than 12 km , otherwise , the presence of hyperons in neutron star cores are ruled out . and",
    "then , the so - called hyperon puzzle is arising ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several methods were proposed to constrain the radius and mass of ns , such as fitting the thermal spectra from quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in globular clusters @xcite , simulating x - ray pulsar profiles @xcite , and photospheric radius expansions ( pre ) bursts ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "type i x - ray bursts in lmxbs are sudden energy release process , which last ten to hundred seconds and can emit as high as eddington luminosity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "in classical view , type i x - ray bursts are powered by the unstable thermonuclear burning of h / he accreted on the neutron star surface through its companion star roche - lobe overflowing .",
    "most of the spectra of type i x - ray bursts can be well fitted by a pure black body spectrum .",
    "pre burst , a special case of type i x - ray burst , were phenomenally distinguished from the time resolved spectra . at the touchdown moment , where the black body temperature and its normalization reach their local maximum and minimum during x - ray burst",
    "respectively , the referred bolometric luminosity corresponds to its eddington luminosity , that is , the radiation pressure is balanced by the gravity .",
    "after the touchdown point , the residual thermal energy cool on the whole surface of neutron star during burst tail .",
    "so , the mass and radius of neutron star could be constrained if the distance to the source was measured independently , i.e. , in globular clusters @xcite .    in the assumption of spherically symmetric emission ,",

    "the factor @xmath20 , is the gravitational redshift correction for strong gravity field on the surface of ns .",
    "@xcite analyzed all pre bursts in globular clusters with known distance , and discussed the potential advantage of pre bursts as `` standard candle '' .",
    "@xcite argued that the luminosity of pre bursts were intrinsically affected by the mass and radius of ns , the variation of photosphere composition .",
    "especially , two low luminosity sources during pre bursts , and , emitted too faint to reach eddington luminosity in the assumption of @xmath21 .",
    "however , the possibility of the observed low flux due to the existence of low mass ns , i.e. , @xmath22 @xcite , can not be ruled out .",
    "we interpret that a low mass ns inside and can explain their low touchdown fluxes in pre bursts .",

    "@xcite explained that the excesses at low and high energies in and other pre bursts were due to accretion enhancement during the burst , analogous to poynting - robertson drag effect .",

    "the state of such quark - cluster matter is very stiff , and the resultant maximum mass of quark - cluster star would be even larger than @xmath114 @xcite , that is consistent with the later discoveries of massive pulsars @xcite .",

    "one usually assumes that the bottom crust density could be as high as the drip density because the transmission probability through the coulomb barrier is negligible for very heavy ions , e.g. , a=118 , z=36 @xcite .",
    "however , accreted matter is mostly composed by ions not so heavy , and the transmission probability through the coulomb barrier could be as high as @xmath121 for @xmath122 , according to the same approximations presented by @xcite . normal matter accreted can then easily penetrate the coulomb barrier , and thus can hardly exist outside a strange quark star ( a new - born strange star could be bare because of strong exploding , otherwise a supernova might not be successful ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of quark - cluster star , additional so - called strangeness barrier exists on quark - cluster surface .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a quark - cluster star may be surrounded by a hot corona or an atmosphere , and even a crust for different accretion rates , which could be helpful to understand the o viii ly-@xmath123 emission line in 4u 1700 + 24 @xcite .",
    "the mass of corona or atmosphere or crust is much less than the conventional value @xmath124 of strange star , hence , the scale is negligible compared with the radius of ns .    on the other hand , @xcite suggested that the strange stars may have a neutralizing solid crust consisting of charged strangelets and electrons , if the surface tension is below the critical value of order a few @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the thickness of strangelet - crystal crust is sensitive to the eos as well as the surface tension and can be changed from zero to hundreds of meters for a compact star of radius 10 km and mass 1.5@xmath126 , or thicker for low mass nss .",
    "but , the thickness of crust do not change the radius of ns significantly even in the extreme case of 4u 1746 - 37 .    as demonstrated in this paper ,",
    "the mass - radius curves of various quark - cluster stars and bare strange stars pass the case of , no matter which geometric effects operated ( reflection or obscuration ) .",
    "certainly , our conclusions are based on the assumption that the observed pre bursts were reached its eddington luminosity . in future observation , if a brighter pre burst is observed in , then a larger mass ns is required .",
    "moreover , we are expecting that the optical observations of next generation telescope tmt ( thirty meter telescope , http://www.tmt.org/ ) could provide rigorous mass constraints .",
    "with tmt , the optical light curves and spectroscopy could be capable to obtain the binary system information ( such as inclination angle , the type of companion star , and mass function ; @xcite ) . and",
