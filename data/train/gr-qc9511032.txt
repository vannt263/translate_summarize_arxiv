    "compact binary star systems are likely to be an important source of gravitational waves for the broadband laser interferometric detectors now under construction  @xcite , as they are the best understood of the various types of postulated gravity wave sources in the detectable frequency band and their waves should carry a large amount of information . within our own galaxy , there are three known neutron star binaries whose orbits will decay completely under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction within less than one hubble time , and it is almost certain that there are many more as yet undiscovered .",
    "current estimates of the rate of neutron star / neutron star ( ns / ns ) binary coalescences  @xcite based on these ( very few ) known systems project an event rate of three per year within a distance of roughly 200 mpc ; and estimates based on the evolution of progenitor , main - sequence binaries suggest a distance of as small as roughly 70 mpc for three events per year .",
    "these distances correspond to a signal strength which is within the target sensitivities of the ligo and virgo interferometers  @xcite .",
    "however , to find the signals within the noisy ligo / virgo data will require a careful filtering of the interferometer outputs . because the predicted signal strengths lie so close to the level of the noise",
    ", it will be necessary to filter the interferometer data streams in order to detect the inspiral events against the background of spurious events generated by random noise .",
    "the gravitational waveform generated by an inspiraling compact binary has been calculated using a combination of post - newtonian and post - minkowskian expansions   to post@xmath9-newtonian order by the consortium of blanchet , damour , iyer , will , and wiseman  @xcite , and will be calculated to post@xmath10-newtonian order long before the ligo and virgo interferometers come on - line ( c.  2000 ) . because the functional form of the expected signal is so well - known , it is an ideal candidate for matched filtering , a venerable and widely known technique which is laid out in detail elsewhere  @xcite and briefly summarized here :    the matched filtering strategy is to compute a cross - correlation between the interferometer output and a template waveform , weighted inversely by the noise spectrum of the detector .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is defined as the value of the cross - correlation of the template with a particular stretch of data divided by the rms value of the cross - correlation of the template with pure detector noise . if the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold , which is set primarily to control the rate of false alarms due to fluctuations of the noise , a detection is registered .",
    "if the functional form of the template is identical to that of the signal , the mean signal - to - noise ratio in the presence of a signal is the highest possible for any linear data processing technique , which is why matched filtering is also known as optimal filtering .    in practice , however , the template waveforms will differ somewhat from the signals .",
    "true gravitational - wave signals from inspiraling binaries will be exact solutions to the einstein equations for two bodies of non - negligible mass , while the templates used to search for these signals will be , at best , finite - order approximations to the exact solutions . also , true signals will be characterized by many parameters ( e.g. the masses of the two objects , their spins , the eccentricity and orientation of the orbit ... ) , some of which might be neglected in construction of the search templates .",
    "thus , the true signals will lie somewhat outside the submanifold formed by the search templates in the full manifold of all possible detector outputs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : manifold ] ) .",
    "apostolatos  @xcite has defined the `` fitting factor '' @xmath11 to quantitatively describe the closeness of the true signals to the template manifold in terms of the reduction of the signal - to - noise ratio due to cross - correlating a signal lying outside the manifold with all the templates lying inside the manifold .",
    "if the fitting factor of a template family is unity , the signal lies in the template manifold .",
    "if the fitting factor is less than unity , the signal lies outside the manifold , and the fitting factor represents the cross - correlation between the signal and the template nearest it in the template manifold .",
    "even if the signal were to lie within the template manifold , it would not in general correspond to any of the actual templates used to search the data .",
    "the parameters describing the search templates ( masses , spins , etc . ) can vary continuously throughout a finite range of values .",
    "the set of templates characterized by the continuously varying parameters is of course infinite , so the interferometer output must be cross - correlated with a finite subset of the templates whose parameter values vary in discrete steps from one template to the next .",
    "this subset ( the `` discrete template family '' ) has measure zero on the manifold of the full set of possible templates ( the `` continuous template family '' ) , so the template which most closely matches a signal will generally lie in between members of the discrete template family ( again , see fig .  [",
    "fig : manifold ] ) .",
    "the mismatch between the signal and the nearest of the discrete templates will cause some reduction in the signal - to - noise ratio and therefore in the observed event rate , as some signals which would lie above the threshold if cross - correlated with a perfectly matched filter are driven below the threshold by the mismatch .",
    "thus the spacing between members of the discrete template family must be chosen so as to render acceptable the loss in event rate , without requiring a prohibitive amount of computing power to numerically perform the cross - correlations of the data stream with all of the discrete templates .",
    "the high computational demands of a laser interferometric detector may in fact make it desirable to perform a _",
    "hierarchical search_. in a hierarchical search , each stretch of data is first filtered by a set of templates which rather sparsely populates the manifold , and stretches which fail to exceed a relatively low signal - to - noise threshold are discarded .",
    "the surviving stretches of data are filtered by a larger set of templates which more densely populates the manifold , and are subjected to a higher threshold .",
    "the spareseness of the first - pass template set insures that most of the data need only be filtered by a small number of templates , while the high threshold of the final pass reduces the false alarm rate to an acceptable level .",
    "theoretical foundations for choosing the discrete set of templates from the continuous family were laid by sathyaprakash and dhurandhar for the case of white noise in ref .  , and",
    "for ( colored ) power - recycling interferometer noise in ref .  .",
    "both papers used a simplified ( so - called `` newtonian '' ) version of the waveform which can be characterized by a single parameter , the binary s `` chirp mass '' @xmath12 .",
    "recently , sathyaprakash  @xcite began consideration of an improved , `` post - newtonian '' set of templates characterized by two mass parameters .",
    "he found that , by a judicious choice of the two parameters , the spacing between templates can be made constant in both dimensions of the intrinsic parameter space .",
    "sathyaprakash s parameters also make it obvious ( by producing a very large spacing in one of the dimensions ) that a two - parameter set of templates can be constructed which , if it does not populate the manifold too densely , need not be much more numerous than the one - parameter set of templates used in refs .  .    in this paper",
    "i shall recast the s - d formalism in geometric language which , i believe , simplifies and clarifies the key ideas .",
    "i shall also generalize the s - d formalism to an arbitrary spectrum of detector noise and to a set of template shapes characterized by more than one parameter .",
    "this is necessary because , as apostolatos  @xcite has shown , no one - parameter set of templates can be used to filter a post - newtonian signal without causing an unacceptably large loss of signal - to - noise ratio .    in one respect ,",
    "my analysis will be more specialized than that of the s - d formalism .",
    "my geometric analysis requires that the templates of the discrete set be spaced very finely in order that certain analytical approximations may be made , while the numerical methods of sathyaprakash and dhurandhar are valid even for a large spacing between templates ( as would be the case in the early stages of a hierarchical search ) .",
    "the small spacing approximation is justified on the grounds that at some point , even in a hierarchical search , the data must be filtered by many closely spaced templates in order to detect a reasonable fraction ( of order unity ) of the binary inspirals occurring in the universe within range of the ligo / virgo network .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , i develop my generalized , geometric variant of the s - d formalism .",
    "i then apply this formalism to the general problem of detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries , and develop general formulas for choosing a discrete template family from a given continuous template family . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1pn ] , i detail an example of the use of my formalism , choosing discrete templates from a continuous template family which describes nonspinning , circularized binaries to post@xmath1-newtonian order in the evolution of the waveform s phase .",
    "i also estimate the computing power required for a single - pass ( non - hierarchical ) search using this discrete template family , and compare to the previous work of sathyaprakash  @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , i summarize my results and suggest future directions for research on the choice of discrete search templates .",
    "in this section , a geometric , multiparameter variant of the s - d formalism is developed .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the following conventions and definitions are assumed :    following cutler and flanagan  , we define the inner product between two functions of time @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( which may be templates or interferometer output ) as @xmath15 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the detector s noise spectrum , defined below .",

    "let us denote the values of the parameters of the actual templates by @xmath47 .",
    "for example , @xmath48 might be the value of the time @xmath30 of coalescence for the @xmath49th template in the family , and @xmath50 might be the phase of the @xmath49th template waveform at coalescence .",
    "the search entails computing , via fast fourier transforms ( fft s ) , all the inner products @xmath51 for @xmath52 in these numerical computations , the key distinction between the extrinsic parameters @xmath27 and the intrinsic parameters @xmath26 is this : one explores the whole range of values of @xmath27 very quickly , automatically , and efficiently for a fixed value of @xmath26 ; but one must do these explorations separately for each of the @xmath53 . in this sense , dealing with the extrinsic parameters is far easier and more automatic than dealing with the intrinsic ones .    as an example ( for further detail",
    "see sec .",
    "16.2.2 of schutz  @xcite ) , for a given stretch of data one explores _",
    "all _ values of the time of coalescence @xmath54 of a compact binary simultaneously ( for fixed values of the other template parameters ) via a single fft .",
    "if we write the fourier transform ( for notational simplicity ) as a continuous integral rather than a discrete sum , we get @xmath55 the discrete fft yields the discrete analog of the function of @xmath30 as shown above , an array of numbers containing the values of the fourier transform for all values of @xmath30 .    because , for fixed @xmath53 , the extrinsic parameters @xmath27 are dealt with so simply and quickly in the search , throughout this paper we shall focus primarily on a template family s intrinsic parameters @xmath26 , which govern the shape of the template .",
    "correspondingly , we shall adopt the following quantity as our measure of the effectiveness with which a particular template shape  i.e .",
    "a particular vector @xmath53 of the intrinsic parameters  matches the incoming signal : @xmath56{c}{\\textstyle\\max}\\\\{\\scriptstyle\\mu}\\end{array } \\langle s | u(\\bbox{\\mu},\\bbox{\\lambda}_{(k ) } ) \\rangle .\\ ] ] here the maximization is over all continuously varying values of the extrinsic parameters .",

    "the discussion of the preceding paragraphs suggests that in discussing the discretization of the template parameters we will want to make use of the _ match _ between two templates @xmath58 and @xmath59 which we will define as @xmath60{c}{\\textstyle\\max}\\\\{\\scriptstyle\\mu,\\delta\\mu}\\end{array } \\langle u(\\bbox{\\mu},\\bbox{\\lambda } ) | u(\\bbox{\\mu}+\\delta\\bbox{\\mu},\\bbox{\\lambda}+\\delta\\bbox{\\lambda } ) \\rangle .\\ ] ] this quantity , which is known in the theory of hypothesis testing as the _ ambiguity function , _ is the fraction of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio obtained by using a template with intrinsic parameters @xmath26 to filter a signal identical in shape to a template with intrinsic parameters @xmath61 .    using the match  ( [ match definition ] ) it",
    "is possible to quantify our intuitive notion of how `` close '' two template shapes are to each other .",
    "since the match clearly has a maximum value of unity at @xmath62 , we can expand in a power series about @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 this suggests the definition of a metric @xmath64 so that the _ mismatch _ @xmath65 between two nearby templates is equal to the square of the proper distance between them : @xmath66    having defined a metric on the intrinsic parameter space , we can now use it to calculate the spacing of the discrete template family required to retain a given fraction of the ideal event rate .",
    "schematically , we can think of the templates as forming a lattice in the @xmath67-dimensional intrinsic parameter space whose unit cell is an @xmath67-dimensional hypercube with sides of proper length @xmath68 .",
    "the worst possible case ( lowest @xmath69 $ ] ) occurs if the point @xmath70 describing the signal is exactly in the middle of one of the hypercubes .",
    "if the templates are closely spaced , i.e.  @xmath71 , such a signal has a squared proper distance @xmath72 from the templates at the corners of the hypercube .",
    "we define the _ minimal match _",
    "@xmath73 to be the match between the signal and the nearest templates in this worst possible case , i.e.  the fraction of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio retained by a discrete template family when the signal falls exactly `` in between '' the nearest templates .",
    "this minimal match is the same quantity that dhurandhar and sathyaprakash in ref .",
    "denote as @xmath74 ; but since it is the central quantity governing template spacing it deserves some recognition in the form of its own name .",
    "our choice of name closely parallels the term `` fitting factor '' @xmath11 , which apostolatos introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure the similarity between actual signals and a continuous template family .",
    "the minimal match , which is chosen by the experimenter based upon what he or she considers to be an acceptable loss of ideal event rate , will determine our choice of spacing of the discrete template parameters and therefore the number of discrete templates in the family .",
    "more specifically , the experimenter will choose some desired value of the minimal match @xmath73 ; and then will achieve this @xmath73 by selecting the templates to reside at the corners of hypercubes with edge @xmath68 given by @xmath75 the number of templates in the resulting discrete template family will be the proper volume of parameter space divided by the proper volume per template @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77      the formalism above applies to the detection of any set of signals which have a functional form that depends on a set of parameters which varies continuously over some range .",
    "we now develop a more explicit formula for the metric , given an analytical approximation to the ligo noise curve and a particular class of inspiraling binary signals .",
    "we approximate the `` initial '' and `` advanced '' benchmark ligo noise curves by the following analytical fit to fig .",

    "this spectrum describes photon shot noise in the `` standard recycling '' configuration of the interferometer ( second term ) superposed on thermal noise in the suspension of the test masses ( first term ) , and it approximates seismic noise by setting @xmath81 infinite at frequencies below the `` seismic - cutoff frequency '' @xmath82 .    throughout the rest of this paper ,",
    "the `` first ligo noise curve '' will refer to ( [ ligo noise curve ] ) with @xmath82 = 40 hz and @xmath79 = 200 hz , and the `` advanced ligo noise curve '' will refer to ( [ ligo noise curve ] ) with @xmath82 = 10 hz and @xmath79 = 70 hz . these numbers are chosen to closely fit fig .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the first ligo interferometers and for the advanced ligo benchmark . in this paper ,",
    "when various quantities ( such as the number of discrete templates ) are given including a scaling with @xmath79 , this indicates how the quantity changes while @xmath79 is varied but @xmath83 is held fixed .    at this point",
    "it is useful to define the moments of the noise curve  ( [ ligo noise curve ] ) , following poisson and will  , as    [ moment definition ] @xmath84 the upper limit of integration @xmath85 denotes the coalescence frequency or high - frequency cutoff of whatever template we are dealing with , which very roughly corresponds to the last stable circular orbit of a test particle in a non - spinning black hole s schwarzschild geometry .",
    "for both first and advanced ligo noise curves , the majority of inspiraling binary search templates will occupy regions of parameter space for which @xmath85 is many times @xmath79 . because we will always be dealing with @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and because the noise term in the denominator of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ moment definition ] ) rises as @xmath88 for @xmath89 , we can simplify later calculations by approximating @xmath90 in the definition of the moments .    to illustrate the metric formalism , we shall use templates based on a somewhat simplified version of the post - newtonian expansion .",
    "since the inner product ( [ inner product definition ] ) has negligible contributions from frequencies at which the integrand oscillates rapidly , it is far more important to get the phase of @xmath91 right than it is to get the amplitude dependence .",
    "therefore , we adopt templates based on the `` restricted '' post - newtonian approximation in which one discards all multipolar components except the quadrupole , but keeps fairly accurate track of the quadrupole component s phase ( for more details see secs .  ii.c . and iii.a . of ref",

    "the mass parameters have been chosen to be @xmath96 , the total mass of the system , and @xmath97 , the ratio of the reduced mass to the total mass .",
    "the actual amplitude @xmath22 of a waveform is proportional to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the distance to the source ; and this lets us find the relation between minimal match and event rate which we will need in order to wisely choose the minimal match . assuming that compact binaries are uniformly distributed throughout space on large distance scales",
    ", this means that the rate of events with a given set of intrinsic parameters and with an amplitude greater than @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "setting a signal - to - noise threshold @xmath101 is equivalent to setting a maximum distance @xmath102 to which sources with a given set of intrinsic parameters can be detected .",
    "thus , if we could search for signals with the entire continuous template family , we would expect the observed event rate to scale as @xmath103 .",
    "this ideal event rate is an upper limit on what we can expect with a real , discrete template family .",
    "we can obtain a lower bound on the observed event rate by considering what happens if all signals conspire to have parameters lying exactly in between the nearest search templates . in this case , all events will have reduced signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath73 times the optimal signal - to - noise ratio @xmath22 . this is naively equivalent to optimally filtering with a threshold of @xmath104 , so a pessimistic guess is @xmath105 for a fixed rate of false alarms .    in real life",
    ", @xmath101 is affected by the total number of discrete templates and by the minimal match of the discrete template family .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath106{c}{\\textstyle\\max}\\\\{\\scriptstyle k}\\end{array } \\bigl [ \\begin{array}[t]{c}{\\textstyle\\max}\\\\{\\scriptstyle\\mu}\\end{array } \\langle o | u(\\bbox{\\mu},\\bbox{\\lambda}_{(k ) } ) \\rangle \\bigr ] , \\ ] ] is the maximum of a number of random variables .",

    "for this two - parameter template family , the formula for the match ( [ match definition ] ) can be simplified somewhat by explicitly performing the maximization over the extrinsic parameters @xmath27 and @xmath108 .",

    "although the phase of the inspiraling binary signal has recently been calculated to post@xmath9-newtonian order  @xcite , it is useful to calculate the number of templates that would be required in a universe where the waveforms evolve only to post@xmath1-newtonian order and all binaries are composed of nonspinning objects in circular orbits .",
    "there are several reasons for this exercise .    1 .",
    "apostolatos  @xcite has shown that amplitude modulation of the waveform due to spin effects is important in an inspiraling binary search only for a few extremal combinations of parameters , and also that ( at higher post - newtonian order ) templates without spin - related phase modulation can match phase modulated signals almost as well as can templates that include spin parameters .",
    "therefore the bulk of the final set of templates actually used when the detectors come on - line will not need to include the extra spin parameters , and we may ignore them in this preliminary work .",
    "we assume circular orbits because gravitational radiation reaction circularizes most eccentric orbits on a timescale much less than the lifetime of a compact binary  @xcite .",
    "the phase of the templates is truncated at post@xmath1-newtonian order for simplicity .",
    "although apostolatos has demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that post@xmath1-newtonian templates will not have a large enough fitting factor to be useful , consideration of such a set is a first step toward obtaining an adequate set of templates  and it is a particularly important step since the metric coefficients will turn out to be constant over the template manifold .      having chosen as the continuous template family the set of post@xmath1-newtonian , circular , spinless binary waveforms , we must now choose the discrete templates from within this continuous family .",
    "the first step is to calculate the coefficients of the metric on the two - dimensional dynamical parameter space .",
    "it is convenient to change the mass parameterization from the variables @xmath134 to the sathyaprakash variables  @xcite @xmath135 note that @xmath136 and @xmath137 are simply the newtonian and post@xmath1-newtonian contributions to the time it takes for the carrier gravitational wave frequency to evolve from @xmath79 to infinity .",
    "the advantage of these variables is that the metric coefficients in @xmath138 coordinates are constant ( in the limit @xmath139 ) for all templates .",

    "if the current `` best estimates '' of inspiraling binary event rates @xcite are correct , the ideal event rate for ligo and virgo will not be more than about one hundred per year even when operating at the `` advanced interferometer '' noise levels , and the loss of up to half of these events would be unacceptable .    from eqs .",

    "this method , based on differential geometry , emphasizes that ultimately a finer template spacing is required than has previously been taken as typical in the literature , in order to retain a reasonable fraction of the event rate .",
    "this paper details the first calculation of this kind that uses post - newtonian templates and a noise curve which takes into account the coloration of noise in the detector due to both standard recycling photon shot noise and thermal noise in the suspension of the test masses .",
    "the result is that it is possible to search the data for binaries containing objects more massive than @xmath160 thoroughly enough to lose only @xmath210 10 percent of the ideal event rate without requiring a quantum leap in computing technology .",
    "the computational cost of such a search , conducted on - line using a single pass through the data , is roughly 20 gflops for the first ligo interferometers ( ca .",
    "2000 ) and 270 gflops for the advanced ligo interferometers ( some years later ) .",
    "this is feasible ( or very nearly feasible ) even for a present - day supercomputing facility , but a hierarchical search strategy ( using as its first stage a widely - spaced set of templates similar to that analyzed by sathyaprakash  @xcite ) may be desirable to reduce the cost .",
    "a thorough investigation of hierarchical search strategies is in order : how should the threshold and the minimal match of the first stage be set in order to minimize the cpu power required while keeping the false alarm and false dismissal rates at acceptable levels ?",
    "how would non - gaussian noise statistics affect the first stage threshold and minimal match ?",
    "would a hierarchical search benefit by using more than two stages ?",
    "how is the threshold affected by the minimal match when the approximation of high signal - to - noise ratio can no longer be made ?",
    "the formalism of this paper should be applied to choose discrete templates from a better continuous template family than the one considered here .",
    "the best two - parameter templates will be based on the highest post - newtonian order computations that have been performed for circularized , spinless binaries , augmented perhaps by terms of still higher order from the theory of perturbations of schwarzschild or kerr spacetime .",
    "i plan to soon apply my geometric formalism to the post@xmath211-newtonian templates which are currently the best available . the areas of parameter space where spins can not be neglected ( noted by apostolatos in ref .",
    "@xcite ) must also be investigated , and the inclusion of an orbital eccentricity parameter should be considered .",
    "there are several more issues which i plan to address using my formalism or some extension of it .",
    "an analysis needs to be made for the case when the signal is not identical to some member of the continuous template family ( i.e.  the fitting factor is not equal to one ) ; and the result of such an analysis should be used to set definite goals for both the fitting factor and the minimal match in terms of event rate .",
    "the effect of non - quadrupolar harmonics of the gravitational wave on the construction of search templates should be considered .",
    "these harmonics have been ignored in all previous analyses of detection and even of parameter measurement , but they may have a noticeable effect when a very high minimal match is desired . finally , a systematic investigation of the optimal choice of search templates outside the continuous template family is in order .",
