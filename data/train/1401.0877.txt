    "wireless two - way relaying scenario in fig . [ relay_channel ]",
    "is considered where bidirectional data transfer takes place between nodes a and b with the help of a relay r. the node a(b ) can not directly communicate with the other end node b(a ) .",
    "it is assumed that all the three nodes are operating in half duplex , i.e. the nodes can not transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band .",
    "physical layer network coding ( plnc ) introduced in @xcite , is a new paradigm for wireless networks where the relay in the network jointly decodes the transmitted messages and broadcasts a function of the decoded messages .",
    "this provides a significant increase in the achievable rates in some networking scenario .",
    "plnc exploited the multiple access interference ( mai ) occurring at the relay in two - way relay channels , so that communication between the end nodes requires two phase protocol .",
    "the relaying protocol consists of two phases , the _ multiple access _ ( ma )",
    "phase where the nodes a and b simultaneously transmit to the relay r , fig .",
    "[ relay_channel](a ) and _ broadcast _ ( bc ) phase where relay r transmits a function of the received signals during ma phase to the nodes a and b , fig [ relay_channel](b ) . at the relay r , network coding is employed so that a(b ) can decode bs(a s ) message , given that a(b ) knows its own message .",
    "information theoretic studies about the achievable rates using physical layer network coding is reported in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "compute and forward strategy in @xcite , exploits the multiple access interference to increase the achievable rates between the users in the network .",
    "encoder maps messages from a finite field to lattice and the decoder recovers the lattice points from the function of the transmitted lattice points and maps back a function over the finite field . in @xcite , in the compute and forward paradigm , the achievable rates can be increased than those achievable by fixed functions by using a multilevel coding scheme based on the channel gains .",
    "denoise and forward ( dnf ) protocol proposed in @xcite , @xcite further improves the achievable rates by combining symbols in the multiple access channel and removing noise from the combined symbols before broadcasting .",
    "a significant improvement in the end - to - end throughput for two - way relay channel using adaptive network coding ( anc ) schemes based on dnf protocol is proposed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the impact of mai is minimized by adaptively changing the network coding maps according to the channel conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "the adaptive network coding maps were obtained using computer search algorithms and in @xcite , adaptive network coding maps were obtained analytically using latin squares approach .",
    "spatial modulation ( sm ) introduced in @xcite , is a recent transmission technique for multiple antenna systems mitigating the inter channel interference ( ici ) .",
    "practical multi antenna systems require multiple radio frequency ( rf ) chains at the transmitter and receiver , increasing the associated cost , hardware complexity and inter antenna synchronization procedures . in sm",
    "only one transmit antenna is active at a time , thus avoiding the above issues and the data is conveyed both through the symbol chosen from constellation and unique transmit antenna number chosen from set of transmit antennas . for the same spectral efficiency ,",
    "sm results in lesser decoding complexity compared to vertical bell labs layered space time ( v - blast ) scheme . in @xcite , generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) uses an optimum number of rf transmit chains and activates more than one transmit antenna to achieve better throughput than spatial multiplexing .",
    "diversity gains are exploited for sm schemes in @xcite , @xcite using space time coding .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that using one rf transmit chain in sm , diversity order of two is achievable using coordinate interleaved orthogonal designs(ciod ) in space time coding .",
    "hence diversity gain can be achieved without increasing the hardware cost and complexity . in @xcite , spatial modulation for two - way network coded channel have been studied and performance analysis is carried out when the end nodes use space shift keying ( ssk ) @xcite .    in this paper , for wireless two - way relaying scenario , we consider all the nodes have only one rf transmit chain similar to spatial modulation technique , thereby using the same resources as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we propose two transmission schemes using physical layer network coding with space time coding with ciod s for two scenarios , scheme - i : when only the relay has two transmit antennas and other nodes have one antenna and scheme - ii : when all the three nodes have two transmit antennas .",
    "the contributions of this paper may be summarized as follows :    * for the proposed scheme - i , coding gain can be achieved compared to the schemes in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this coding gain is due to the reduction of bc phase errors by using space time coding .",
    "* for the proposed scheme - ii , a diversity order of two can be achieved by physical layer network coding with space time coding at all nodes using ciod s compared to the schemes in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which have diversity order one .",
    "but this advantage comes at a cost of increased decoding complexity at r.    hence just by adding an extra uncorrelated antenna at the nodes for transmission in the existing schemes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , without using a second rf chain , and space - time coding over these antennas can achieve coding and diversity gains .",
    "hence the average end - to - end symbol error probability can be reduced significantly without increasing the hardware cost and complexity for implementation .",
    "the organization of rest of the paper is as follows : section [ preliminaries ] gives a brief description of the preliminaries used in the paper .",
    "the two proposed schemes , scheme - i and scheme - ii are explained in sections [ aplnc_sm ] and [ plnc_sm ] respectively .",

    "it can be seen from the plots that scheme - i performs better than the anc schemes mentioned in @xcite , @xcite because the bc phase errors become less dominant as they have a diversity order of 2 .",
