    "we are presently targeting photometrically  selected faint galaxies for spectroscopic study at the keck telescopes with the goal of measuring redshifts and star  formation rates at early cosmic epochs . selecting high  redshift galaxies based upon their continuum properties ( weymann 1998 ) is important and complements work on emission line  selected galaxies at @xmath15 found serendipitously ( dey 1998 ) and from narrow  band imaging ( cowie & hu 1998 ; hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ) . studying galaxies at these high redshifts",
    "has important implications for tracing the formation of galaxies and large scale structure , mapping the history of star formation , and understanding the chemical history of the universe .    the hubble deep field ( hereinafter hdf ; williams 1996 ) has galvanized a renewed effort at estimating photometric redshifts ( lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez  soto 1996 ; sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; see also hogg 1998 ) .",
    "the extremely deep multiband integrations through the crisp eye of the _ hubble space telescope _ _ ( hst ) _ supplemented by several deep campaigns across the electromagnetic spectrum ( at radio , sub - millimeter , far ",
    "infrared , and near  infrared wavelengths  fomalont 1997 ; hughes 1998 ; rowan  robinson 1997 ; hogg 1997 ; eisenhardt 1996 ; thompson 1998 )  are an ideal data set with which to estimate redshifts based upon broad  band colors .",
    "redshift targets are robustly selected based upon the redshifted lyman break at @xmath16   and the redshifted discontinuity at @xmath17  , causing the galaxies to effectively disappear , or `` drop out '' , at short wavelengths .",
    "@xmath18band dropouts , corresponding to @xmath10 , have been systematically studied by several groups ( steidel 1996a ; lowenthal 1997 ; spinrad 1998 ; bunker 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath19band dropouts , corresponding to @xmath20 , and @xmath0band dropouts , corresponding to @xmath21 , are beginning to be addressed ( dickinson 1998 ; weymann 1998 ; dey 1998b ) .",
    "our present list of potential @xmath22 candidates ( @xmath19 and @xmath0dropouts ) includes six galaxies with @xmath23 in the hdf ( fernndez  soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1998 ; ab scale used throughout . ] ) .",
    "their spectroscopic study , even with the large aperture of the keck telescopes and dark sky of mauna kea , is clearly a technical challenge .",
    "weymann s ( 1998 ) confirmation of a galaxy at @xmath24 illustrates that the @xmath0drop technique works .",
    "a systematic survey , however , is necessary to assess that this population is not contaminated by lower ",
    "redshift interlopers such as galaxies with extremely high equivalent width emission lines ( ) in the @xmath25 filter .",
    "we describe the observations of one @xmath0drop system , hdf  3951.0 .",
    "our data imply a redshift of @xmath26 for this system , one of the highest redshifts yet measured and among the first systematically pre  selected galaxies at @xmath27 .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for these parameters , 1 subtends 5.6 ( 10.2 ) @xmath30 kpc at @xmath31 and",
    "the universe is only 820 myr ( 1.56 gyr ) old , corresponding to a lookback time of 93.7% ( 90.6% ) of the age of the universe .",
    "we present our observations in the following section , our redshift determination in  3 , and discuss the galaxy s inferred properties in  4 .",
    "hdf  3951.0 is a faint galaxy `` pair '' , comprised of hdf  3951.1 and hdf  3951.2 , near the edge of the wf3 ccd of the hdf . in fig .  1 we present f606w ( @xmath32 ) and f814w ( @xmath25 ) images of the galaxy .",
    "extant photometry of this system is assembled in table  1 .",
    "clearly the most outstanding photometric features of the composite ( hdf  3951.0 ) energy distribution are the non  detection at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the marginal detection in @xmath32 , and the very red color in @xmath35 . the energy distribution appears to flatten at longer wavelengths with @xmath36 .",
    "these colors qualitatively suggest a high  redshift , star  forming system with the forest attenuating the spectrum below @xmath25 and ob stars dominating the rest",
    " frame uv past . a more detailed technique employing template spectra and maximum likelihood analysis yields a photometric redshift of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) for this system and @xmath37 ( @xmath3 ) for hdf  3951.1 alone ( the brighter component ; object # 3 in fernndez  soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1998 ; see also lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez  soto 1996 ) .",
    "comparisons between photometric and spectroscopic redshift determinations show that the former is typically robust to @xmath38 for objects with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( fernndez  soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1998 ) .",
    "however , an accurate determination of the redshift requires deep spectroscopy , and so we observed the hdf during three observing runs in 1998 using the spectroscopic mode of the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke 1995 ) at the cassegrain focus of the keck  ii telescope . only the data collected on ut 1998 february 19 were of high quality ; ut 1998 january 20 suffered from poor seeing and high cirrus , while integrations on ut 1998 march 28 & 29 were plagued by poor seeing .",
    "all observations employed milled slitmasks constructed to allow simultaneous observations of seven @xmath19 and @xmath0dropout galaxies . the 15 wide slitlets were typically 20 long , allowing sufficient slit length for sky subtraction at the expense of a diminished number of targets .",
    "slitmask observations were made at a position angle of @xmath41 ( east of north ) with the 400 l / mm grating ( @xmath42  ; @xmath43  ) sampling the wavelength range @xmath44  .",
    "small spatial shifts ( @xmath45 ) were performed between each @xmath46 exposure to facilitate removal of fringing in the near  ir regions of the spectrograms .",
    "all data reductions were performed using the iraf package and followed standard slit spectroscopy procedures .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using a near lamp , employing telluric lines to adjust the zero  point .",
    "flux calibration was performed using observations of g191b2b , feige  34 , hz  44 , and wolf  1346 ( massey 1988 ; massey & gronwall 1990 ) and accurate spectrophotometry was verified against the hdf photometry by convolving the spectra of hdf  3951.0 and a brighter galaxy which serendipitously lay along one of the slitlets ( hdf  3493.0  @xmath47 ) with the f814w filter response function .",
    "hdf  3951.0 was detected during all three observing runs .",
    "however , the february data ( seeing @xmath48 07 , photometric ) , comprising four integrations totaling 6900@xmath49 , is of much higher signal  to  noise ratio ; our final spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) is composed from the february data alone .",
    "our final spectrogram of the unresolved pair of faint galaxies ( fig .",
    "2 ) yields a fairly noisy but robust result : above 7720  there is a roughly flat continuum ( in @xmath50 ) with a mean flux near @xmath51 .",
    "almost no light is detected below 7700  ( @xmath52 ) , and an accordingly large and abrupt discontinuity exists at @xmath4  .",
    "an accurate measurement of the discontinuity wavelength is made difficult by the faint magnitudes considered and the challenges of sky subtraction in the 7700  oh sky emission band .",
    "we note that the faintness and 061 separation of hdf  3951.1 and hdf  3951.2 makes separate spectroscopy with ground  based instrumentation exceedingly difficult .",
    "their unusual , yet similar colors , however , support the hypothesis that they lie at the same redshift .",
    "disparate redshifts would lead to a dilution of the 7710  break amplitude .",
    "the spectrum is also obviously inconsistent with a single high  equivalent width emission line dominating the @xmath25 flux and causing the extremely red @xmath53 color .",
    "our spectrophotometry yields a 2@xmath54 limit to the equivent width of an unresolved emission line @xmath55 for @xmath56  .",
    "if the red @xmath53 color were due to an extremely strong emission line in @xmath25 , the required equivalent width would be at least @xmath57  , for a constant slope continuum fit to the @xmath32 and @xmath58 upper limit magnitudes .",
    "discontinuities of this amplitude ( @xmath59 ) are unprecedented in optical spectra of stars and galaxies . averaging the spectrum in 10 pixel ( @xmath60  ) bins and considering poissonian counting statistics , we find the average flux density above the discontinuity is @xmath61 , while the average flux density below the discontinuity is @xmath62 , consistent with no observable flux . there is , at this @xmath63 magnitude level , a small systematic problem .",
    "the 95% ( 99% ) confidence limit to the amplitude of this continuum depression , calculated from monte carlo simulations of the flux densities with the constraint that @xmath64 , is then @xmath65 ( 0.82 ) . in order of decreasing wavelength ,",
    "discontinuities are commonly observed in uv / optical spectra of galaxies at rest wavelengths of 4000  ( @xmath66 ) , 2900  ( @xmath67 ) , 2640  ( @xmath68 ) , 1216  ( ) , and 912  ( the lyman limit ) .",
    "the hydrogen discontinuities derive from associated and foreground absorption and thus have no theoretical maximum . the longer rest ",
    "wavelength discontinuities derive from metal absorption in the stars and galaxies , and are thus dependent upon the age and metallicity of the galaxy ( fanelli 1992 ; spinrad 1997 ) . the largest measured values of @xmath66 in lower ",
    "redshift , early  type galaxies are @xmath69 ( dressler & gunn 1990 ; hamilton 1985 ) , corresponding to @xmath70 , while _ iue _ spectra of main  sequence stars exhibit @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( spinrad 1997 ) , corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we can safely rule out the low  redshift interpretations of the spectrum of hdf  3951.0 .",
    "the 7710  break is also unlikely to be associated with a lyman limit at @xmath74 ; at that redshift , the forest would likely obliterate the rest ",
    "frame @xmath75  spectrum .",
    "itself would be at @xmath76 m , which is a very challenging wavelength for current ccd detectors .",
    "identifying the break with is the lowest redshift and most likely interpretation under these circumstances .",
    "large breaks are occasionally seen in exotic objects as well .",
    "for instance , the iron low  ionization broad absorption line quasar ( fe lo - bal ) first  j155633.8 + 351758 ( becker 1997 ) has a discontinuity with @xmath77 around 2800  .",
    "however , this object belongs to an exceedingly rare type of quasar , a classification which we can rule out for hdf  3951.0 due to its resolved morphology .",
    "furthermore , radio  loud broad absorption line quasars tend to have very red optical / near  ir colors ( hall 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore associate the break with the forest , implying a redshift @xmath78 .",
    "the systematics of absorption might provide a systematic redward bias of @xmath79  in high  redshift galaxies , associated and foreground absorption generally displaces emission lines redward of their host galaxy systematic velocity by up to several hundred .",
    "in fact , this mechanism also imprints an asymmetry onto the emission line , when present , thus providing a powerful discriminant between high  redshift and low  redshift ( see dey 1998a ) .",
    "the sharpness of the discontinuity and the flatness of the longer  wavelength spectrogram ( in @xmath50 ) are further arguments for identifying the break with the forest onset . for the remainder of this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath80 for the redshift of the faint galaxy pair hdf  3951.0 .",
    "our deep spectroscopy confirming the high  redshift of hdf  3951.0 , as well as weymann s ( 1998 ) confirmation of hdf  4473.0 at @xmath24 , illustrates that the photometric redshift technique , and , in particular , @xmath0drop selection , is a robust method for selecting and studying the distant universe .",
    "we now derive some basic physical properties of hdf  3951.0 , consonant with its faint magnitude .",
    "if the uv continuum is dominated by light from young , hot stars , the star  formation rate ( @xmath81 ) may be derived from the uv flux at @xmath82  . assuming the continuum emission from hdf  3951.0 is unreddened and has a spectral slope of @xmath83 , consistent with the observations , we derive @xmath84 and @xmath85 ab mag for hdf  3951.0 based upon the flux density between 8000 and 9000  ( see table  1 ) .",
    "madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 ) calculate @xmath86 for @xmath87 measured in units of and a @xmath88 myr old population with a salpeter imf ( @xmath89 ) . this is roughly consistent with the relation derived from the leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) models for a different imf and much younger ages of @xmath90 myr .",
    "these conversions are meant to be illustrative rather than definitive ; they depend upon the assumed star ",
    "formation history , imf , metallicity , and age . the lower limit on the inferred star  formation rate for hdf  3951.0 is thus @xmath91 , assuming the absence of dust absorption .",
    "dickinson ( 1998 ) finds that the ultraviolet luminosity function of lyman  break galaxies at @xmath92 is well  modeled by a schechter luminosity function of characteristic absolute magnitude @xmath93 ab mag .",
    "this implies that the hdf  3951.0 galaxies are individually sub  luminous , but slightly brighter than @xmath9 when considered as a single system uncorrected for extinction .",
    "formation rates may also be determined for the galaxy pair individually utilizing the imaging photometry , without reference to the spectrophotometry . assuming a heaviside function spectrum with @xmath94 below 7710  , and @xmath95 redward of 7710  , the @xmath25 magnitudes may be used to calculate an upper limit on the flux density redward of .",
    "this then yields @xmath96 and , with the above prescription , the inferred star formation rate ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we find @xmath97 for hdf  3951.1 and @xmath98 for hdf  3951.2 .",
    "the flat red end of the spectrum of hdf  3951.0 is similar to spectra of @xmath10 lyman break galaxies ( steidel 1996a )  systems which are well  represented by an ob stellar population with little dust .",
    "deep keck / lris spectroscopy of some of the brighter @xmath99 lyman break population suggests that galaxies with in emission are generally flatter in @xmath50 at @xmath100  , while those galaxies with in absorption are generally redder at these wavelengths ( spinrad 1998 ) . from a study of vacuum",
    "uv _ iue _ spectra of local starburst galaxies , heckman ( 1998 ) find that metal ",
    "rich starbursts are redder and more heavily extinguished ( have larger values of @xmath101 ) , have stronger rest  frame uv absorption lines , and occur in more massive and brighter host galaxies .",
    "similarly , the brightest lyman break galaxies tend _ not _ to have in emission ( steidel , private communication ) , possibly a result of the galaxies lying in deeper potential wells and thus being more able to retain gas and dust which scatter and absorb the photons and redden the @xmath102  continuum . in this scenario ,",
    "the apparent flatness of our hdf  3951.0 spectrum at @xmath103  is inconsistent with the lack of a measurable emission line .",
    "however , relatively small column densities of neutral gas with even very small dust content can destroy emission if this gas is static with respect to the ionized region where photons originate ( kunth 1998 ) .",
    "hdf  3951.0 is potentially reddened by foreground and associated dust , consistent with the lack of emission ; our ground  based limits on the near  ir magnitude of the system constrains @xmath104 ( for a dust  free heaviside spectrum subject to extinction by a foreground screen of dust following the extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "this level of extinction would imply intrinsic star formation rates @xmath105% higher than the values quoted above .",
    "a real measurement of the dustiness of the galaxy pair must await deep near ",
    "ir images of the field , as have recently been obtained with nicmos on the _",
    "hst_.    we next consider the @xmath25 morphology of this system ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the full  width , half  maxima ( fwhm ) of hdf  3951.1 and hdf  3951.2 are 050 , and 028 respectively . comparison with a star reveals that both are clearly resolved ( fwhm@xmath106 ) with deconvolved half ",
    "width , half  maxima ( hwhm ) of 024 and 012 respectively .",
    "for @xmath107 = 0.5 ( 0.1 ) , these correspond to 1.3 ( 2.5 ) @xmath30 kpc for hdf  3951.1 and 0.7 ( 1.2 ) @xmath30 kpc for hdf  3951.2 , comparable to the values found for many of the @xmath92 lyman  break galaxies ( giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ) .",
    "hdf  3951.1 ( the brighter component ) contains sub  structure , with a second `` hot spot '' @xmath48  012 east of the core , at a projected separation of 0.66 ( 1.2 ) @xmath30 kpc .",
    "we speculate that this is either a knot of star formation ( bright in the rest  frame uv ) , or evidence of multiple nuclei .",
    "the projected proximity of hdf  3951.2 adds weight to the hypothesis that this is a dynamically  bound system , and that we are witnessing a merger event .",
    "break galaxies at @xmath108 often exhibit either disrupted morphologies or multiple components ( giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ; steidel 1996b ; bunker 1998 ) .",
    "due to the sub  structure of its core , hdf  3951.1 is not fit well by either a de  vaucouleurs @xmath109 law nor an exponential surface brightness profile .",
    "the exponential disk appears to dominate in a two  component model , and the scale length is 023 , equivalent to @xmath110 = 1.3 ( 2.3 ) @xmath30 kpc .",
    "the elongation is @xmath111 .",
    "the fainter hdf  3951.2 is well  fit by an exponential disk profile , with a scale length of 012 , corresponding to 0.65 ( 1.2 ) @xmath30 kpc , and is almost circular ( @xmath112 ) . as with the @xmath108 population",
    ", we note that hdf  3951 is significantly more compact at rest ",
    "frame uv wavelengths compared to local disk galaxies , which have typical scale lengths of @xmath48  5  kpc at optical wavelengths ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "the angular separation of 061 projects to 3.4 ( 6.2 ) @xmath30 kpc for @xmath113 , implying that hdf  3951.0 is a pair of sub  luminous systems of modest projected separation .",
    "what can we say about the evolutionary fate of hdf  3951.0 ? given the small physical sizes and projected separation , in all likelihood hdf  3951.1 and hdf  3951.2 will merge into a single galaxy .",
    "assuming a relative velocity of @xmath114 km s@xmath115 and a physical separation equal to the projected @xmath116 kpc , the crossing time is @xmath117  myr .",
    "thus we estimate the merger time scale for hdf  3951.1 and hdf  3951.2 is a few crossing times ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ) , or @xmath14 myr .",
    "indeed , we suggest that hdf  3951.1 and hdf  3951.2 are already in the process of merging ; we are perhaps witnessing the galaxies in a post  collision state , with the luminosity enhanced by merger ",
    "induced star formation .",
    "studies of low  redshift merging systems find enhanced rates of star formation ( sanders 1988 ) , consistent with the apparently ob star  dominated spectrum of hdf  3951.0 .",
    "we note that our @xmath25 images sample the rest ",
    "even in present  day galaxies , uv ",
    "emitting regions in galaxies are typically small .",
    "alternatively , two regions of active star  formation within @xmath118 5 kpc of each other may well be star  forming knots within the same galaxy .",
    "wavelength imaging will help resolve this question .",
    "indeed , preliminary reductions of nicmos observations of the hdf suggest that these objects remain separate in f160w images ( rest  frame @xmath119  ; dickinson , private communication ) .",
    "we note , finally , that the size and luminosity of hdf  3951.0 suggest it to be a more distant version of the @xmath120 galaxies discussed by pascarelle ( 1996 ) which have typical half  light radii of @xmath121 .",
    "what are the implications of the large continuum discontinuities in the region ? how reliable is the nomimal factor of 10 at 95% confidence level we suggest , and how does it propagate to the @xmath122 parameter ( oke & korycansky 1982 , madau 1995 , schneider 1991ab ) ? the largest discontinuities previously measured in quasar spectra at @xmath15 are approximately a factor of 4 ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "our determination of the @xmath50 break amplitude for hdf  3951.0 is made difficult since the composite galaxy spectrum is very faint at @xmath123  .",
    "oke & korycansky ( 1982 ) define @xmath122 as @xmath124 from the february 1998 data , we measure average flux densities of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the implied 95% ( 99% ) confidence limit to @xmath122 is then @xmath127 0.82 ( 0.75 ) .",
    "the 1998 january and march data qualitatively support our large amplitude break , but quantitatively do not aid our numerical evaluation of it .",
    "larger values are possible and future , more sensitive observations will determine a more precise value of @xmath122 for this system .    alternatively , we can produce a photometric estimate of @xmath122 utilizing the williams ( 1996 ) broad band colors , the _ hst_/wfpc2 filter curves , and the plausible assumption ( born out by our spectra to date ) that the @xmath50 flux distributions above and below are flat .",
    "we assume a two  step spectral energy distribution with zero flux below the lyman limit , @xmath128 between the lyman limit and , and @xmath129 redwards of . for @xmath130 ,",
    "54% of the f606w flux comes from @xmath131  ( the lyman limit at @xmath80 ) and 48% of the f814w flux comes from @xmath132  ( at @xmath80 ) .",
    "for the observed magnitudes of hdf  3951.0 , this implies @xmath133jy and @xmath134jy .",
    "the resultant `` photometric discontinuity '' , with @xmath135 is @xmath136 .",
    "this agrees with the break amplitude derived from the keck spectrogram and is much higher than previously reported values of @xmath122 ( also see dey 1998 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we present recent measurements of @xmath122 from spectra of quasars and high  redshift galaxies , where hdf  3951.0 is indicated by the more robust photometric measurement . the weymann ( 1998 )",
    "points utilize their photometry , corrected for the emission line flux of @xmath137 , and a @xmath138 spectrum fit to the nicmos near  ir brightnesses ( top point ) . the lower weymann ( 1998 ) point utilizes an @xmath139 spectrum , corresponding to their best  fit semi  empirical model .",
    "our concern about the break amplitude arises from its strength : madau s ( 1995 ) theoretical estimate of the contribution of the forest to @xmath122 is only @xmath118 0.79 at @xmath80 and @xmath118 0.83 at @xmath24 .",
    "this extrapolation assumes a distribution of high and low optical depth foreground clouds causing lyman series absorption in the spectrum of a distant quasar or galaxy .",
    "the scatter around the madau curve is substantial , even at lower redshifts , so the high values of @xmath122 at @xmath27 may simply reflect the usual scatter observed in that parameter .",
    "however , at large enough redshift our line of sight _ must _ penetrate the end stages of reionization ( loeb 1998 ; miralda  escud & rees 1997 ) where a smooth distribution of neutral hydrogen gas will cause an additional gunn  peterson opacity at @xmath140  . whether this starts at @xmath141 or",
    "@xmath142 remains an intriguing question .",
    "are we seeing the first hints of the gunn  peterson trough in these distant systems ?",
    "if we see enhanced ( gunn  peterson ) absorption short  ward of ( corresponding to @xmath143 ) relative to the expected thickening of the forest , one might begin to further exploit spectrophotometry of these distant galaxies in a novel and useful manner .",

    "<S> fernndez  soto , lanzetta , & yahil ( 1998 ) derive a photometric redshift of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) for these galaxies ; our integrated spectrograms show a large and abrupt discontinuity near @xmath4  . </S>",
    "<S> this break is almost certainly due to the forest as its amplitude ( @xmath5 confidence limit ) exceeds any discontinuities observed in stellar or galaxian rest  frame optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting _ absorption  break _ redshift is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> optical / near  ir photometry from the hdf yields an exceptionally red ( @xmath7 ) color , consistent with this large break . a more accurate measure of the continuum depression blueward of utilizing the imaging photometry yields @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the system as a whole is slightly brighter than @xmath9 relative to the @xmath10 lyman break population and the total star formation rate inferred from the uv continuum is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) assuming the absence of dust extinction . </S>",
    "<S> the two individual galaxies are quite small ( size scales @xmath13 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus these galaxies superficially resemble the pascarelle ( 1996 ) `` building blocks '' ; if they comprise a gravitationally bound system , the pair will likely merge in a time scale @xmath14 myr .    # </S>",
