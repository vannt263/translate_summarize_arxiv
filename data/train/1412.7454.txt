    "to prove the magnetic origin of the inelastic excitation detected for fe - oep - cl , we acquired @xmath6 spectra at different magnetic ( b ) field strengths aligned perpendicular to the sample surface . figure  [ fig : bfield](a ) shows @xmath6 spectra measured on an fe - oep - cl molecule at fields ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath11  t. the b field quenches the superconducting state of sample and tip .",

    "simultaneously , a v - shaped gap is opened around zero bias .",
    "the energy of this new excitation increases with the b field strength .",
    "the appearance as a dip is due to the overlap of steps at opposite energies , which are fermi - dirac broadened at @xmath65  k. we can describe the spin excitations in an anisotropic environment and magnetic field by the following phenomenological spin  hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath66 the first term yields the zeeman splitting , with @xmath67 being the land g - factor , @xmath68 the bohr magneton , @xmath69 the magnetic field vector and @xmath70 the spin operator .",

    "the violet arrows indicate the transitions from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , and from @xmath76 to @xmath78 , respectively .    in the case of fe - oep , we were not able to detect unambiguous evidence of a zeeman shift of the spin excitations in fields of up to @xmath11  t at a temperature of @xmath65  k. this is understood by taking the relevant energies of the system into account . in a @xmath26 system in zero magnetic field , the transverse anisotropy @xmath34 mixes the pure spin states @xmath79 and @xmath80 . an applied magnetic field in @xmath47 direction will reduce the mixing and restore the pure spin state if @xmath81 . at intermediate fields ,",
    "the energy of the two states is given as @xmath82 .",
    "with a transverse anisotropy of @xmath83  mev ( approximate median of all measured molecules ) , this results in changes of the excitation energies of @xmath84ev at @xmath11  t , which is small compared to the temperature broadening at @xmath65  k ( @xmath85ev ) .",
    "yet , the agreement of the deduced axial anisotropy with bulk measurements of other fe@xmath33 porphyrins  @xcite , together with the absence of any excitation in this energy range in the spectrum of fe - oep - cl , renders a vibrational origin of the observed inelastic excitations implausible and corroborates our interpretation as spin excitations of a @xmath26 system ."

    "<S> . the fluctuation in @xmath34 and @xmath32 values are probably due to slight variations in the adsorption site within the self - assembled islands .    to gain an intuitive picture of the origin of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the two molecules , we consider the different ligand field splitting and @xmath0 level occupation of the fe ion in the two complexes ( figure  [ fig : lfs ] ) . the ligand field experienced by the fe@xmath35 in is of square - pyramidal nature . </S>",
    "<S> the axial cl ligand , which is a weak ligand compared to the pyrole nitrogen , lifts the fe@xmath35 out of the macrocycle plane  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the magnetocrystalline anisotropy results from the admixture of electronically excited states of reduced total spin [ _ e.g. _ e@xmath36 and e@xmath37 in figure  [ fig : lfs](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the lifting of the fe center out of the pyrole plane leads to a relatively large fe  surface distance , which makes the fe@xmath35 insensitive to variations of the adsorption site .    in the case of fe - oep , </S>",
    "<S> the fe@xmath33 lies in the square - planar ligand field of the porphyrin macrocycle . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane position of the fe@xmath33 yields shorter fe  </S>",
    "<S> n distances and a larger ligand field splitting , in particular the energy of the @xmath38 level is strongly increased compared to fe - oep - cl . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the intermediate spin ( @xmath26 ) ground state e@xmath39 as depicted in figure  [ fig : lfs](b ) . since the splitting between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 is small in fe(ii ) </S>",
    "<S> porphyrins  @xcite , there is a strong admixture of e@xmath36 and e@xmath37 to the ground state and hence a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the admixture of these lowest lying states yields contributions to the orbital moments @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath44 and @xmath45 direction , respectively , but not to @xmath46 , the orbital moment in @xmath47 direction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resulting anisotropy is easy - plane , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath28 , as we can write  @xcite , with @xmath48 being the spin - orbit coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , the shorter fe  surface distance compared to fe - oep - cl results in a higher sensitivity to variations in the adsorption site . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic environment underneath the fe@xmath33 ion mainly affects the @xmath41 and @xmath40 levels , because they extend toward the surface , resulting in slight variations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and , therefore , @xmath32 and @xmath34 [ note :    @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction with the surface also explains the reduction of the @xmath50 symmetry evidenced by the non - zero @xmath34 parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the above shown sensitivity of the zero field splitting to small variations in the environment provides access to a controlled tuning . with this intention </S>",

    "<S> the presence of the tip alters the ligand field , while we simultaneously record ists curves at varying tip  </S>",

    "<S> to @xmath55 the axial anisotropy @xmath32 slightly increases , before it rapidly decreases for shorter distances . </S>",
    "<S> this variation of @xmath32 is qualitatively different from the variation observed earlier on fe - oep - cl  @xcite , where @xmath32 exponentially increased with decreasing tip  </S>",
    "<S> sample distance .    these variations in the zero field splitting of the two species can be understood considering the changes in geometry induced by the proximity of the stm tip . in the relaxed adsorption state of fe - oep ( in absence of the stm tip ) , the fe ion is expected to be attracted toward the surface , thus lying slightly below the porphyrin plane . </S>",
    "<S> the tip potential then exerts an opposed attractive force on the fe atom , which pulls it toward the opposite side of the macrocycle due to a surface trans effect  @xcite . passing through the molecular plane causes first a small decrease in fe  </S>",

    "<S> fe distance increases the energy of the @xmath41 orbital [ sketched in figure  [ fig : dz](c ) ] . the larger energy difference between @xmath56 and @xmath41 enhances also the energy difference @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the admixture of the excited states and , hence , the magnetocrystalline anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario thus explains the initial slight increase in @xmath32 between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( fe  surface distance increased and , therefore , lower @xmath41 energy ) and its subsequent pronounced decrease upon further tip approach .    in the case of fe - oep - cl , </S>",
    "<S> the tip potential acts ( mainly ) on the cl ligand pointing upwards and attracts the cl atom toward the tip . in turn , the cl  </S>",
    "<S> fe bond weakens and the fe ion relaxes toward the molecular plane , decreasing the fe  </S>",
    "<S> n bond length . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting changes of the ligand field splitting are sketched in figure  [ fig : dz](c )    : the @xmath41 ( @xmath38 ) orbital shifts down ( up ) in energy as the fe  cl ( fe  n ) distance increases ( decreases ) . </S>",
    "<S> these changes increase the overall ligand field splitting and reduce the total energy difference @xmath58 , which also includes the spin pairing energy . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller energy difference between ground and excited states enhances their admixture according to perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this yields larger orbital moments @xmath42 and @xmath43 and , therefore , larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the local control of the magnetic properties of nanostructures , such as the spin state or the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , is a prerequisite for their successful application in spintronic devices . in thin metallic films  @xcite and clusters  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , an external electric field can be applied to tune the magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> for single atoms , so far only static control of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy has been achieved by the selection of the adsorption site on surfaces  @xcite . in the chemical approach , </S>",
    "<S> organic ligands are used to determine the ligand field splitting and magnetocrystalline anisotropy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach provides the flexibility to continuously tune the magnetocrystalline anisotropy by modifying the geometry of the atomic - scale surrounding , even though it is , so far , restricted to changes in the order of 10% . </S>",
    "<S> the opposed variations in the anisotropy induced by the tip for the two types of molecules discussed , underline the importance of a smart chemical engineering to achieve desired functionality and highlight the degree of freedom that can thereby be reached . </S>",
