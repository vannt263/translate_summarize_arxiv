    "therefore , careful surface treatments and exact optical measurements are inevitable to get correct electrodynamical responses and to understand the basic mechanism of the cmr .    in this paper , we present optical conductivity spectra @xmath8 of nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( nsmo ) _ single crystal _ for annealed and polished surfaces .",

    "ev , grating spectrometers were used . especially above 6.0 ev",
    ", we used the synchrotron radiation from the normal incidence monochromator beam line at pohang light source ( pls ) .",
    "@xmath17-dependent @xmath16 below 6.5 ev were measured using a liquid he - cooled cryostat . to subtract surface scattering effects from @xmath16",
    ", we used the gold normalization technique@xcite : a gold film was evaporated onto the sample surface just after spectra were taken .",
    "then , the reflectivity of the gold coated surface was measured and used for normalizing @xmath16 of the nsmo sample .",
    "using the kramers - kronig ( kk ) analysis with the normalized @xmath16 , we obtained @xmath8 .",
    "for this analysis , @xmath16 in the low frequency region were extrapolated with the hagen - rubens relation@xcite for metallic states and with constants for insulating states . to obtain accurate @xmath8 in the far - infrared region",
    ", we also compared @xmath16 extrapolated using the hagen - rubens relation with those extrapolated using the drude model , and we obtained nearly the same results in the far - infrared region .",
    "the @xmath17-dependent @xmath16 spectra below 6.5 ev were smoothly connected with the reflectivity data obtained at room temperature from 6.0 to 30 ev , assuming that reflectivity in the high energy region should be nearly temperature independent . for the frequency region above our measurements , the reflectivity at 30 ev was extended up to 40 ev and then @xmath18 dependence was assumed . using spectroscopic ellipsometry ( se ) , we obtained @xmath8 in the region of 1.5 @xmath19 5.0 ev without relying on the kk extrapolation .",
    "the @xmath8 obtained by the se method were quite consistent with those by the kk analysis .",
    "this fact suggests validity of our gold normalization techniques and the extrapolations used in the kk analysis .",
    "although the oxygen annealing process does not change @xmath14 very much , it affects the optical responses of nsmo significantly .",
    "2(a ) shows @xmath16 for the polished and the annealed surfaces of the nsmo single crystal .",
    "[ note that both of these spectra were corrected by the gold normalization technique , so differences are mainly due to the oxygen annealing effects . ] in the insulating region above @xmath15 , the differences in @xmath16 are not significant .",
    "however , in the metallic region below @xmath15 , @xmath16 for the polished surface are much lower in the frequency region from 2@xmath2010@xmath21 to 1.5 ev .",
    "the dip in @xmath16 , so - called the  plasma edge  , for the polished surface appears around 0.6 ev , which is much lower than the observed dip around 2.0 ev for the annealed surface .",
    "the differences in the polished and the annealed surfaces can be clearly seen in @xmath8 , which are displayed in fig .",
    "after the annealing , the spectral weight in the infrared region becomes enhanced considerably .",
    "although drude - like peaks at the far - infrared region can be observed at 15 k for both surfaces , @xmath8 of the polished surface has a smaller spectral weight .",
    "changes in the optical response due to the oxygen annealing were already noticed in nsmo thin films .",
    "et al_. reported that a nsmo film , whose resistivity peak temperature @xmath22 was located around 180 k , had a strong mid - infrared peak and no drude - like free carrier peak.@xcite later , the same group reported that @xmath22 of a nsmo film became about 230 k when it was annealed in an oxygen environment.@xcite they showed that the strength of the mid - infrared peak became weakened considerably and that the drude - like free carrier behavior appeared in the oxygen - annealed nsmo film .",
    "we think that the optical response changes in the nsmo film were related with the dc resistivity changes reported by xiong _",
    "et al_.@xcite they investigated the effects of oxygen annealing in nsmo films . with more annealing ,",
    "their resistivity values became smaller and @xmath22 moved to a higher temperature .",
    "they suggested that the annealing effects in the nsmo films could be explained by a change of oxygen content and a variation of mixed mn@xmath23/mn@xmath24 ratio .    since @xmath14 of our nsmo single crystal does not change by the annealing process , the optical response changes observed in fig .",
    "2 might not come from oxygen content changes .",
    "we think that the differences in optical spectra should be originated from damages due to the polishing process .",
    "since the electron - phonon interactions are believed to be very strong in manganites , the stress applied during the polishing process could damage the surface region and deform optical responses significantly .",
    "we also found that light scattering from the polished surface was quite severe in the nsmo sample . figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) show @xmath16 and @xmath25 of the oxygen annealed nsmo sample at 15 k , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines are results without any correction , and the solid lines are results after the gold normalization .",
    "@xmath16 in fig .",
    "3(a ) show that the light scattering effects are not significant below 0.1 ev , but that they become very severe between mid - infrared and visible regions .",
    "the scattering loss effects become evident in @xmath8 .",
    "3(b ) shows that the spectral weight becomes reduced in most of the frequency region .",
    "especially , the spectral change below 0.5 ev becomes quite large .",
    "recently , takenaka _",
    "et al._@xcite compared optical reflectivity spectra of ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 cleavage surfaces with those of polished surfaces , and they showed that @xmath8 of the cleaved surface have a much more enhanced drude weight .",
    "they claimed that the damage of the polished surface should result in a serious distortion in @xmath8 . since the optical spectra of their cleaved surface [ i.e. fig . 2 of ref . 5 ]",
    "are very similar to our results after the oxygen annealing and the gold normalization processes , it can be suggested that the differences observed by takenaka _ et al .",
    "_ were likely to be remedied by our experimental techniques .      in fig .",
    "4 , we show @xmath17-dependent @xmath16 of the annealed nsmo single crystal from 5 mev to 10 ev . at 300 k , there are three sharp peaks originated from optic phonon modes in the far - infrared region . and , broad peaks above 0.1 ev come from the optical transitions between electronic levels . with decreasing @xmath17 , the value of reflectivity approaches to 1.0 in the dc limit ( i.e. @xmath26 0 ) and the sharp phonon features become screened by free carrier .",
    "note that there are strong @xmath17-dependence in @xmath16 up to 5.0 ev .",
    "similar behaviors were observed in other cmr manganites.@xcite    figure 5 shows @xmath17-dependent @xmath8 of the annealed nsmo single crystal , which were obtained by the kk analysis . in the temperature region above @xmath15 , we can see two interesting features : an optical gap near 0.18 ev , and broad peaks around 1.2 and 4.5 ev . as @xmath17 decreases , a significant amount of spectral weight between 1.0 and 5.0 ev moves to a low energy region . above 5.0 ev ,",
    "the spectral weight is nearly @xmath17-independent . due to the similarities in peak position and strength to those of charge transfer transitions in the other manganites,@xcite the peak around 4.5 ev",
    "can be assigned to a charge - transfer transition between the o 2_p _ and the mn _",
    "e_@xmath6 bands .",
    "the large spectral weight change between 2.0 and 5.0 ev can be interpreted in terms of an interband transition between the hund s rule split bands , i.e. _",
    "e_@xmath27(_t_@xmath28 ) @xmath29 _ e_@xmath27(_t_@xmath30 ) and _ e_@xmath31(_t_@xmath30 ) @xmath29 _ e_@xmath31(_t_@xmath28 ) , in the de picture.@xcite [ this notation indicates that the transitions occur between two _ e_@xmath6 bands with the same spin but different _",
    "t_@xmath7 spin background . ]",
    "as @xmath17 decreases below @xmath15 , the spins of the _ t_@xmath7 electrons are pointing along one direction and the interband transition becomes weakened , which results in the decrease of the spectral weight .",
    "now , let us focus on the spectral weights in the insulating state .",
    "although the peak near 1.2 ev appears to be one broad peak , we claim that it should be interpreted in terms of a two - peak structure : one peak is located near 1.5 ev and the other is located below 1.0 ev . for most manganites with hole concentrations below 0.4 ,",
    "the 1.5 ev peak could not be seen clearly .",
    "however , there have been several reports which support the existence of the 1.5 ev peak.@xcite from doping dependent conductivity studies on ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 , jung _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that such a peak should exist .",
    "et al._@xcite also observed similar peaks in transmission spectra of ( nd@xmath32sm@xmath33)@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath2 and sm@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath2 films . and , to explain optical spectra of nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin films , quijada _",
    "et al._@xcite assumed the existence of the 1.5 ev peak .",
    "moreover , if the broad peak around 1.2 ev is interpreted as one optical transition related to small polaron absorption , there will be some discrepancies between the optical data and other experimental data . for examples",
    ", recent transport measurement shows that a small polaron activation energy should be about 0.15 ev,@xcite which is smaller than 0.3 ev.@xcite when we accept the double - peak structure , we can present a schematic diagram for the spectral weight in the insulating state , which is shown in fig .",
    "as shown in this diagram , there are four main peaks below 5.0 ev : ( i ) a small polaron absorption peak below 1.0 ev , ( ii ) a peak centered around 1.5 ev , ( iii ) a broad peak centered around 3.5 ev , which is originated from interband transitions between the hund s rule split bands , and ( iv ) a peak due to charge transfer transitions between the o 2_p _ and the mn _ e_@xmath6 bands .",
    "figure 7 shows detailed @xmath17-dependent @xmath8 below 2.0 ev .",
    "the solid square , triangle , and circle represent the measured dc conductivities of 15 , 120 , and 180 k , respectively . above @xmath15 ,",
    "we can find three optic phonon modes .",
    "with cooling , the optic phonon modes become screened by free carrier , but their signature can be observed even at 15 k. as @xmath17 decreases below @xmath15 , the spectral features above 0.8 ev decrease , and those below  0.8 ev increase significantly . the increasing spectral weight below @xmath15 seems to form an asymmetric band , whose peak position moves down with decreasing temperature . even at 15 k ,",
    "@xmath8 seem to make a downturn around 0.1 ev , and the corresponding dc conductivity is higher by about 1000 @xmath36@xmath37 than @xmath38 ev@xmath39 .",
    "similar spectral weight changes have been commonly observed in other manganites.@xcite    it should be noted that reported behaviors of the broad peak structures in the low frequency regions ( especially , below 0.5 ev at @xmath40 ) are varied quite a lot in earlier works .",
    "et al._@xcite measured optical responses of ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 single crystals , and claimed that the corresponding drude peaks are very weak and sharp .",
    "similar behaviors were observed in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 polycrystalline samples by kim _",
    "et al._@xcite however , quijada _",
    "et al._@xcite investigated @xmath8 of annealed nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 films on laalo@xmath2 substrates , and observed broad and strong @xmath8 features at the low frequency region .",
    "they attributed these features to drude responses and coherent conductions .",
    "et al_.@xcite measured @xmath8 of a la@xmath41ca@xmath42mno@xmath2 single crystal . at 78 k , its @xmath8 showed a very broad drude - like behavior which was much stronger than those of polycrystalline samples_. _ takenaka _",
    "et al . _ also measured @xmath8 of cleaved ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 single crystals , and observed a drude - like peak with a large spectral weight .",
    "the low temperature spectral responses observed by quijada _",
    "et al._@xcite and boris _ et al_.@xcite are similar to our @xmath8 data at 15 k , displayed in fig .",
    "it demonstrates that the low frequency responses of the manganites are very sensitive to the sample preparation conditions .",
    "one important question which we should address at this point is whether we should interpret the low - frequency broad absorption feature below 0.5 ev at 15 k as a single component drude peak .",
    "there are three important experimental facts which we should notice .",
    "first , our experimental data showed the downturn of optical conductivity around 0.1 ev at @xmath40 .",
    "the la@xmath41ca@xmath42mno@xmath2 single crystal data by boris _",
    "et al_. showed the same behavior . and , the thin film data by quijada",
    "_ showed similar trends , although such behaviors were neglected by the authors since the downturn regions were close to the low - frequency infrared cutoff of laalo@xmath2 substrates .",
    "second , the spectral weight changes of all the reported experiments , including the nsmo single crystal case displayed in fig . 7 , can not be described by a decrease of one spectral component at a fixed frequency and an increase of a single drude component near the zero frequency .",
    "rather , they can be reasonably described by a continual evolution of an asymmetric peak whose position moves down as the sample changes from the insulating state to the metallic state .",
    "a similar trend was observed for the room temperature data of the cleaved ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 single crystals , investigated by takenaka _",
    "_ as sr doping increased and the sample became more metallic , a spectral weight increased in the low frequency region , which could be described by a continual movement of an asymmetric peak .",
    "third , some optical data can not provide reasonable values for electrodynamic quantities , when a single component drude peak is assumed .",
    "for example , the single crystalline la@xmath41ca@xmath42mno@xmath2 data at 78 k indicate mean free path _",
    "@xmath43 3.9 @xmath5 5.2  , which is comparable to the lattice constant  @xmath44 .",
    "this value is rather too small for metallic conduction.@xcite on the other hand , assuming the two components response for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 polycrystals , kim _",
    "et al_.@xcite reported that _",
    "l _ @xmath5 25   at 15 k and that _",
    "l _ becomes about 4.2   near the metal - insulator transition temperature .",
    "therefore , we think that the low frequency response should be interpreted in terms of two components , i.e. a coherent narrow drude peak and an incoherent mid - infrared absorption band .",
    "figure 6(b ) shows a diagram of @xmath45 for @xmath17 @xmath46 @xmath15 , which takes account of the two - component contributions .",
    "other features of the diagram are following : the peak due to the charge transfer transition is nearly @xmath17-independent . and ,",
    "as temperature decreases below @xmath15 , the transition between the hund s rule split bands becomes weakened and the spectral weight below 1.0 ev increases significantly .    as displayed in fig .",
    "7 , the incoherent mid - infrared absorption band is quite asymmetric and the drude weight starts just below the characteristic phonon mode frequency .",
    "these optical features are quite consistent with coherent and incoherent absorptions of a large polaron , predicted by emin.@xcite from these observations , it can be argued that a crossover from small to large polaron states accompanies the insulator - metal transition in nsmo .",
    "such a crossover from the small to the large polaron was also observed by other experiments , including raman scattering@xcite and pulsed pdf measurements.@xcite in this polaron crossover scenario , the strong oxygen annealing dependence of the optical responses in the metallic states might be explained . just after the polishing",
    ", the surface region should be damaged quite significantly , which blocks the motion of incoherent polaron motion . however , after the annealing , such stress - induced damages could be repaired .",
    "more detailed investigations are needed to clarify this scenario .      to get a further understanding on the low energy spectral weight",
    ", we evaluated the effective number of carrier , @xmath47 , below a cutoff frequency , @xmath48 :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a free electron mass and @xmath51 represents the number of mn atoms per unit volume . for actual estimation , the value of @xmath48 was chosen to be 0.8 ev , since the low frequency spectral weight below @xmath52 ev increases as @xmath17 decreases below @xmath15 , as displayed in fig",
    "figure 8 shows the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath53 ev@xmath39 . above @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath54 is nearly independent of @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath17 decreases , @xmath54 shows an increasing behavior . in the simple de picture",
    ", the spectral weight of the drude carriers should be proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the magnetization .",
    "however , measured magnetization data show a very sharp increase near @xmath15 , so a quantitative agreement between @xmath54 and @xmath55 could not obtained .",
    "recently , kim , _",
    "investigated optical properties of ( la , pr)@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2,@xcite and found that all of @xmath57 data for various values of pr concentration can be scaled with @xmath58 , which represents the temperature dependent de bandwidth due to spin ordering within the de model predicted by kubo and ohata.@xcite to explain this scaling behavior , they adopted the theoretical results@xcite based on a hamiltonian including the de interaction and jahn - teller ( jt ) electron - phonon coupling terms .",
    "they showed that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the polaronic band narrowing term .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "8 represents the predicted behavior of @xmath61 , which agrees quite well with the evaluated values of @xmath53 ev@xmath39 .",
    "this agreement suggested that both the de interaction and the jt electron - phonon coupling play important roles in nsmo .",
    "one of the important issues in barely conducting materials is to determine electrodynamic quantities , such as scattering rate @xmath62 , carrier density @xmath63 , and effective mass @xmath64 .",
    "the mean free path @xmath65 _  _ and dc conductivity @xmath66 can be written in terms of the electrodynamic quantities :    @xmath67    and    @xmath68    assuming hole carrier conduction ( i.e. @xmath69 ) , _ l _ at 15 k was estimated to be about 13  .",

    "<S> we investigated temperature dependent optical conductivity spectra of nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 _ single crystal_. we found that polishing and surface scattering effects on the nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 crystal surfaces could significantly distort the optical responses , especially in the mid - infrared region . </S>",
    "<S> however , oxygen annealing and gold normalization processes seemed to remedy the distortions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the spectral weight of nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 in the metallic state might be composed of a drude carrier term and a strong incoherent mid - infrared absorptions . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the spectral weight suggests that the electron - lattice coupling should be important in optical properties of colossal magnetoresistance manganites . </S>"
