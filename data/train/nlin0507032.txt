    "the purpose of this paper is to set the stage for a close examination of fluid phenomena , an examination at the particle level .",
    "most fluid phenomena of interest are the result of its behavior in interaction with surfaces , other fluids or , indeed , with itself .",
    "the eddies and turbulence attendant fluid shear are extremely complex . as one fluid",
    "is injected into another , the shear effects depend further on the different attributes of the fluids .",
    "if a fluid is flowing , it is doing so with respect to something , a surface for instance .",
    "a dimensionless quantity used to characterize the nature of fluid flow is reynolds number :    @xmath0    where    * @xmath1 is the density of the fluid , *   @xmath2 is its velocity , *   @xmath3 is the fluid s viscosity and *   @xmath4 is called `` a characteristic length . ''",
    "what does `` characteristic length '' mean ?",
    "@xmath4 is a length that is defined only in terms of the boundaries of the flow such as the diameter of a tube or the chord length of an airfoil .",
    "what length is it and why ?",
    "in fact , reynolds number is only well - defined in discussions of model scaling of fluid flows in interaction with solid surfaces .",
    "for example the characteristics of a flow around a boat with a beam of 4 meters in an ocean current of 10 knots will be the same for a scale model of the boat in the same ocean water whose beam is 0.4 meters and where the current is 100 knots .",
    "what meaning can references to reynolds number have ?",
    "bernoulli s relation involves the fluid velocity . in a venturi tube",
    ", it is the velocity with respect to the wall of the tube .",
    "if a high fluid velocity implies a low pressure , how can the pressure readings in different parts of the tube be different since the sensors are in the boundary layer of the fluid at the surface of the wall of the tube ?",
    "the boundary layer is stationary .",
    "it is these and other baffling questions that has launched the author into these investigations .",
    "even though aerodynamics engineers are masters at designing airframes , they are refining known technology . without understanding from first principles",
    ", lighting engineers would just be refining incandescent lamps and we would not have fluorescent lights or leds .",
    "the behavior of real fluids , i.e. compressible and viscous , is to this day baffling in many ways .",
    "part of the reason is that explanations of fluid behavior are hold - overs from the pre - twentieth century belief that a fluid is a fundamental entity , not composed of anything else.@xcite the trouble with this approach is that it provides only viscosity and pressure as ways of understanding how the fluid interacts with itself or with solid bodies .",
    "both are intensive variables but what do they mean for volumes so small that the fluid approximation is not valid ?",
    "pressure , @xmath5 ( stress normal to a surface ) can be understood as that fluid property which causes a normal force on a surface in the flow ,    @xmath6    the shear force provides part of the drag on a surface .",
    "it is derived from the shear stress , @xmath7 , tangential to the surface .",
    "@xmath8    where    @xmath9    here ,    * @xmath10 is the location on the surface of the airfoil , * @xmath11 is a length in the direction normal to the surface , * @xmath12 is the radius of curvature at @xmath13 * @xmath14 is the velocity of the flow relative to the surface , * @xmath15 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid , * @xmath16 is the shear and * @xmath17 is the resulting shear stress on the surface .",
    "figure [ fig : bl ] shows qualitatively the velocity profile in the boundary layer during laminar flow .",
    "the curve is differentiable and indicates that there is slip the surface .",
    "admitting the possibility of slip at the airfoil surface is contrary to the no - slip assumption of ludwig prandtl@xcite but in view of the development in section [ sec : mech ] below and the work of johan hoffman and claes johnson,@xcite there is reason to suspect the reality of the no - slip assumption . at the surface , because of the interaction of the particles in the flow with each other and with the ( possibly submicroscopic ) features of the surface , the behavior is very complex but for laminar flow this structure is smoothed out as the disturbance recedes into the flow .    a common example of this is the bow - wave of a slowly moving boat .",
    "close inspection of the behavior of the water at the bow reveals great complexity but far from the boat the wave is very regular and smooth .        in order that the equation have meaning",
    ", the function @xmath14 must be smooth and differentiable .",
    "however , as the flow velocity increases , there is an onset of turbulence .",
    "the boundary layer develops eddies near the surface  @xcite and @xmath14 becomes non - differentiable and so the partial derivative in equation ceases to exist .",
    "the behavior of the fluid becomes very complex and the flow becomes unsteady ; the fluid assumption becomes invalid .    since the work of boltzmann  @xcite and einstein  @xcite , i.e. theory based on the postulate , and supporting evidence , that fluids are composed of tiny particles , deeper insight is possible by considering in detail the interactions of these particles with each other , those of other fluids , and those of solid bodies in the flow .",
    "in fact it may be helpful to remember that the only interactions a fluid can have , according to this model , are through momentum transfer or van der waals forces between its particles and between the particles and the surface .",
    "the molecules of a gas at standard pressure are only within van der waals distance 1/100th of the time they are apart so these forces only play a part in particle - particle scattering .    the notion ,",
    "therefore , that a streamline in a gas flow is `` attracted '' by a surface is not correct . if a stream of gas , as in coand flow,@xcite seems attracted to a solid object it is due to its self - interaction , interaction with gas outside the flow , and the forces its particles exert on the surface as they strike it , not due to an attractive force between the particles and the surface .",
    "in contrast to the work of bernoulli , there is no `` coand equation '' because , other than newton s laws , we have no physical model for the behavior of the particles in the boundary layer .",
    "henri marie coand was an engineer and observed effects that are widely incorporated into modern aerodynamic design but physicists have not developed a tractable mathematics to describe the behavior of such a large number , @xmath18 , of simple interactions without the fluid assumption .",
    "in any case , to explore a mathematical model is not the same as to explore the physical world ( see appendix [ woodsapp ] ) . one goal of theoretical physics is the calculation of the results of experiments , another is to understand why the world works as it does .",
    "the miracle is that mathematics is as useful as it is in describing and predicting physical effects .",
    "the statements made below about fluid flow are conclusions and hypotheses coming from a consideration of particles obeying newton s laws .",
    "the author s intention is to stimulate the reader s thoughts about the behavior of fluids in regimes where the flow is not steady , and hence the fluid assumption is invalid .",
    "another aim of this paper is to discern _ causes _ of phenomena .",
    "a mathematical equation does not contain causal information .",
    "for example , the thrust of a rocket is not _ caused _ by the velocity of the exiting gases but by the pressure difference between the throat and the projection along the axis of the motor of the throat area onto the back wall of the motor .",
    "bernoulli s equation relates the the exit velocity and the pressure difference but conveys no information as to which is the cause and which is the effect .",
    "it is only from experience with the physical world and abstractions of that experience that one knows that in newton s second law it is force that causes acceleration , not the reverse .",
    "it is hoped that an understanding of the true causes of aerodynamic effects will lead to new aerodynamic designs and the rethinking of designs already created .",
    "imagine , for a moment , that in the absence of a tractable mathematical model , non - mathematical understanding is possible .",
    "for perfectly elastic collisions the effect on a surface over an area @xmath19 results in a force , @xmath20 with components normal and transverse to the area .    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the mass of one particle and the @xmath23 are the accelerations of the particles hitting the surface area @xmath19 and the summation is over the area .",
    "the normal component is due to pressure and the transverse component is due to the viscous interaction of the fluid with the surface .",
    "as the particles move over the surface , they are affected by the molecular protuberances on the surface and by van der waals forces between the particles and the surface .",
    "this friction force is proportional to the area @xmath24 as well .    the total force on the airfoil , then , is the vector sum of the normal and tangential force components over the total airfoil area :    @xmath25    the integral form of this equation is    @xmath26    the minus sign indicates that the force on the particules is opposite to the force on the surface .      the equation of state for an ideal gas is    @xmath27    where    * @xmath28 is the pressure , * @xmath29 is volume , * @xmath30 is the number of moles of gas in @xmath29 , * @xmath31 is the gas constant and * @xmath32 is the kelvin temperature .",
    "* @xmath33 is the number of particles in @xmath29 and * @xmath34 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath35    also , the density , @xmath1 is    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is avogadro s constant , the number of particles in one mole .    making the ideal gas assumption then ,    @xmath38    far away from the airfoil , the pressure , @xmath5 is approximately constant and uniform except for the effect of gravity and the compressibility of air can be ignored .",
    "but _ on the surface _ of the airfoil , it is precisely pressure _ differential _ that causes lift .",
    "equation reveals that @xmath39 and @xmath32 , subject to the laws of thermodynamics , are at the disposal of the aeronautical engineer for creating a favorable pressure field on the airfoil s surface .",
    "aerodynamic forces affecting a rigid surface are always net forces produced by differences in pressure between different parts of the surface .",
    "the absolute pressure on a surface area element is the density of the normal components of the forces acting on the surface there .",
    "aerodynamic forces on a body are caused _ only _ by collisions of fluid particles with the body s surface . at the molecular level ,",
    "the flow particles encounter any surface as a molecular structure which is rough , with protuberances whose size is of the order of magnitude of the flow particles themselves ( see figure [ fig : drag ] . ) .",
    "as particles collide with the surface , their momentum components normal to the surface there cause lift , positive or negative , and stagnation pressure and the parallel components cause viscous drag and give rise to a boundary layer which is carried along by the surface ( see ref .",
    "it is clear , then , that the microscopic structure of the surface and the properties of the fluid will affect drag and lift , even for @xmath40 .",
    "a perfectly smooth surface would have no viscous drag , there would be no shear in the fluid near the surface and , it would appear , a wing made of this material would have lift only if the air flow momentum density had components normal to the bottom surface of the wing , i.e. due to the angle of attack , @xmath41 .",
    "even though these momentum transfers occur only in the boundary layer that appears to be `` dragged along '' by the surface , they are responsible for the whole of lift and drag . actually , fluid particles can leave and enter the boundary layer by moving normal to the surface .",
    "dust on a surface in a flow is not disturbed laterally because the boundary layer is motionless , or nearly so , at the surface .",
    "the boundary layer is created by the interaction of the main flow particles with particles bouncing off the surface . for the time being , we assume that all collisions , particle - particle and particle - surface , are perfectly elastic and that the particles are spheres .",
    "let us consider the flat surface in panel a ) of figure [ fig : curvedsurface ] .",
    "the pressure on the surface is due only to the normal components of the momenta of the impacting particles .",
    "flow along such a surface will not affect surface pressure .",
    "as particles are blown away from the surface , other particles are drawn in from outside to replace them .",
    "pressure on the surface is due to collisions of particles with the surface .",
    "where the flow has no normal component , the pressure is due only to the thermal motion and density of the particles in the boundary layer , i.e. the static atmospheric pressure .",
    "hence this pressure will be a function only of the mass of a particle , the particle density , and kelvin temperature of the air at the surface .    in reality",
    ", the fluid particles in a layer around a surface boundary seem to be carried along with the surface , i.e. the distribution of the components of their velocities parallel to the surface is nearly@xcite circularly symmetric about a mean which is the velocity of the surface relative to the free - stream velocity .",
    "particles , as large as dust particles or as small as the molecules making up the flow , experience van der waals forces attracting them to the surface . whether or not the particles are fixed on the surface by these forces depends on the structure of the molecules making up the flow and those making up the surface .",
    "these van der waals forces are responsible for the `` wetting '' of the surface . in some cases , e.g. teflon and water , the fluid drains off the surface quite readily just under the force of gravity .",
    "in other cases , e.g. modern motor oil on a bearing surface , the fluid may adhere for months or even years .    in any case",
    ", however , particles continually leave the boundary layer and enter it transversely from the flow due to heat energy or , at an angle of attack , because they have velocity components normal to the surface . beyond a mean free path meters for @xmath42 at standard pressure and temperature . ] or so but still in the boundary layer , the distribution of the normal components of particles velocities moving toward or away from the surface will depend on the temperature and density of the particles .",
    "even though it is regularly driven at high speed , a car will accumulate dust on its body .",
    "an air stream directed toward the surface , however , will blow off some of that dust . as we will see , it is the mutual interaction of flow particles and these `` stagnant '' boundary layer particles that is responsible for a part of the lift on an airfoil at subsonic speeds .",
    "an increase in the free - stream velocity means that the components of the velocities of the flow particles increase in the direction of the free - stream velocity and parallel to the surface .",
    "the reason that the boundary layer remains quiescent , or nearly so , is that the components of the colliding particles velocities parallel to the surface reverse as they collide with microscopic irregularities .",
    "this is one of the causes of aerodynamic drag and accounts for the fluid s viscosity .",
    "if the collisions are not perfectly elastic , the rebound speed is less than the incident speed and the surface absorbs some of the particle s energy , i.e. it heats up .          in a steady flow over a surface , stream particles have only thermal velocity components normal to the surface .",
    "if the surface is flat , the particles that collide with boundary layer particles are as likely to knock them out of the boundary layer as to knock others in , i.e. the boundary layer population is not changed and the pressure on the surface is the same as if there were no flow . if , however , the surface curves away from the flow direction , the particles in the flow will tend to take directions tangent to the surface , i.e. away from the surface , obeying newton s first law . as these particles flow away from the surface , their collisions with the boundary layer thermal particles tend to knock those particles away from the surface",
    "what this means is that if all impact parameters are equally likely , there are more ways a collision can result in a depletion of the boundary layer than an increase in the boundary layer population .",
    "the boundary layer will tend to increase in thickness and to depopulate and , according to equations and the pressure will reduce there . this is why the flow is forced toward the surface , the coand effect with the attendant suction that draws in fluid far from the surface .",
    "those particles in the flow that do interact with the stagnant boundary layer will give some of their energy to particles there . as they are deflected back into the flow by collisions with boundary layer particles , they are , in turn , struck by faster particles in the flow and struck at positive impact parameters .",
    "the following figure consists of 4 frames taken from an animation@xcite illustrating the behavior of flow particles as they interact with stagnant particles in the boundary layer .",
    "the first panel shows the incoming particles in red approaching from the right . in the second panel",
    "the incoming particles begin to interact with the stagnant particles meant to approximate a boundary layer .",
    "the third panel shows the boundary particles being blown away by the incoming set , thus reducing the pressure at the surface .",
    "as panel four shows , it is primarily the boundary layer particles that make up the flow that clings to the curved surface .",
    "these frames show , at least qualitatively , the coand effect .",
    "the figures are frames taken from an animation made with working model@xcite software . in the video ,",
    "approximately 600 small circles are launched toward a fixed circle with stagnant circles positioned around it , meant to simulate a boundary layer .",
    "all collisions are perfectly elastic and the large circle has infinite mass .",
    "of course , this model is highly unrealistic because of the very small number of particles , their simple circular structure , the smoothness of the surface and the absence of thermal motion .",
    "it does , however , show boundary layer depletion and the `` wrapping '' of the flow around the surface .",
    "a more accurate simulation would have a continuous flow impinging on a rough surface surrounded by particles .",
    "all the particles should be interacting thermally with each other and with the surface .",
    "notice also that the wrapped flow contains almost none of the red incoming particles .    in reality , the flow shears past the surface ( where the molecular motion is complex and chaotic ) and the fluid velocity as a function of the distance normal to the surface is a smooth function of this distance .",
    "the velocity profile curve parameters are constants depending on the fluid velocity , the physical characteristics of the surface and the particles making up the fluid ( see figure [ fig : bl ] ) . in any case , as the flow velocity increases , separation points will begin to appear@xcite .",
    "these are the points on the surface where the directional derivative of the fluid velocity normal to the surface vanishes as does the shear ( equation ) .",
    "as the fluid velocity increases even further , the derivatives at the separation points actually reverse sign , there is backward flow on the surface.@xcite vortices have formed downstream from these stagnation points .",
    "all this is in the language of fluids .",
    "what is going on at the particle level though ?",
    "the curved part of the surface acts as the obstruction mentioned in the explanation of the vortex process ( see section [ sec : vortex ] . ) because it presents stagnant particles to the flow .",
    "the flowing particles as they approach the surface interact with these particles and with the surface itself .",
    "some populate the boundary layer and then interact as stagnant particles with other particles in the flow .",
    "there is a constant interchange of particles between the boundary layer and the flow .",
    "as these interactions take place the process described above activates the boundary layer particles like falling dominoes , causing the enveloping flow .",
    "when the surface curves away from the flow , the flow particles , obeying newton s first law , tend to travel on trajectories tangent to the surface and thus leave its vicinity , taking some boundary layer particles with them .",
    "this reduced pressure in the boundary layer has two effects .",
    "first , it causes the higher pressure in the main flow to force itself , and smoke streamers , toward the surface , and and second , it results in lift as the higher pressure on the bottom of the wing has increased effect .",
    "the coand effect is investigated in some detail in articles in _",
    "deutsche luft- und raumfahrt_@xcite .",
    "h. riedel s paper has numerous diagrams of flow patterns and distributions of pressure differentials on a wing surface in various positions with respect to an air jet .",
    "figure [ fig : wingflow ] is from this paper .",
    "the first panel in figure [ fig : wingflow ] shows the flow of and around a free stream in an atmosphere .",
    "note the entrainment of air from outside the stream .",
    "panels 2 and 3 show flow and distributions of pressure differentials on a wing in the flow .",
    "note that in panel 3 there is a sharp spike in downward pressure where the flow actually impinges vertically on the surface .",
    "this downward pressure is the cause of wing stall .",
    "flow along a _",
    "positively curved _ surface causes a lowering of the pressure on the wing but if the curvature is too great , a vortex will be created which can cause an increase of pressure there .",
    "the coand effect gives a hint at at what turns out to be the most important cause of lift at zero or small angle of attack . while it may be intuitive that the main cause of lift is the high pressure under the wing , in fact it is very largely due to the _ decreased _ pressure on the _ top _ of the wing just aft of the leading edge stagnation point .",
    "( see reference @xcite , page 181 . )",
    "professor marco colombini at the university of genoa , italy@xcite has produced some interesting animations illustrating the pressure distribution around a standard airfoil at varying angles of attack .. ] it is interesting to think of airfoil design as an exercise in _ managing buoyancy .",
    "_      dirigibles , helium balloons and hot - air balloons utilize buoyancy lift .",
    "they are sometimes called aerostats because they achieve lift without movement , without a main air flow .",
    "they generate neither upwash or downwash as a third - law reaction to this lift .",
    "these devices rise due to the difference in the atmospheric pressure between top and bottom .",
    "this buoyant force acts naturally on everything immersed in a fluid in a gravitational field .",
    "it acts on us but we do nt notice it because the density of our bodies is so much greater than the density of air where we live .",
    "archimedes noticed this buoyant force and uttered the famous `` @xmath43  ! '' he knew how to measure the density of the king s crown and to test if it was pure gold .",
    "one might think that the buoyant force , which is due to the gravitational field , would be negligible for an airplane because the airplane s overall density is much greater than air at standard conditions .",
    "however , see section [ sec : coanda_effect ] below . since the buoyant force is due to the pressure differential between the top of a body and the bottom , the buoyancy can be managed by controlling these pressures .      as a fluid",
    "stream passes through an opening in a barrier into stagnant fluid , eddies appear .",
    "consider the state of the fluid as the flow begins . behind the barrier the distribution of velocities of the particles of the fluid in a small volume is spherically symmetric ( except for the effect of gravity ) and",
    "the mean of the distribution is a function of the kelvin temperature .",
    "upstream , the pressure behind the barrier is higher than the pressure behind the exit .",
    "a particle on a streamline just grazing the barrier encounters particles behind that barrier whose mean velocities are zero .",
    "downstream of the barrier , the result of collisions with these stagnant particles is the slowing of a flow particle as well as its deflection back into the flow .",
    "( see figure [ fig : vortexprocess ] .",
    ")    the greater the difference between the flow velocity and the thermal velocities of the stagnant particles , the closer to 90@xmath44 from the flow direction will be the directions of the stagnant particles after the collisions .",
    "thus the interaction between the stream and the stagnant region serves to sort out the colder stagnant particles and force them away from the flow .",
    "the vortex heat pump described later in section [ vortexrefrig ] , figures [ fig : vortextubesch ] and [ fig : vortextubediag ] uses this principle .",
    "as the stream particles that have suffered collisions with stagnant particles are hit by faster ones in the stream , they too are deflected with a velocity component normal to the stream velocity . as they continue after being deflected away from the stream",
    ", they hit other stagnant particles ( figure [ fig : vortexprocess ] ) , forcing them toward the same center .",
    "the result is that part of the flow is changed into a vortex . if the obstruction is a hole in a plate , some of the energy of the flow is trapped in the form of a vortex ring .",
    "if the flow is a pulse , this ring follows in its wake .",
    "let the lower half of the _ y - z _ plane be a barrier in the fluid .",
    "( see figure [ fig : vortexprocess ] . )",
    "the velocity of the flow will be superimposed on the random motion of the molecules , i.e. heat .",
    "as the flow begins , say from minus to plus in the @xmath45-direction , the mean of the distribution of the velocities of those particles in the flow will be shifted toward positive @xmath46 .",
    "as these particles pass the barrier , they collide with fluid particles that have a velocity distribution with zero mean , i.e. the particles are stagnant .",
    "call an impact parameter positive if the location of the impact point with a particle in the flow is a positive distance in @xmath47 from the center of one of these particles .",
    "if it passes the edge of the barrier with sufficient speed , a flow particle is likely to hit a particle behind the barrier with a positive impact parameter .",
    "this will result in the stagnant particle being knocked back behind the barrier ( see figure [ fig : vortexprocess]a . ) .",
    "the flow particle will be deflected up into the flow , with reduced momentum where it will be deflected by other particles in the flow and eventually be knocked back , away from the flow ( figure [ fig : vortexprocess]b ) .",
    "these particles still have an _ x_-component of velocity that is larger than their _ y - z _ velocities but as they interact with each other and other particles in the flow in the way described above , they will participate a circular flow and their energy will decrease .",
    "this process repeated statistically with various impact parameters results in a vortex . we will call it the _ vortex process .",
    "_        consider a velocity coordinate system local to a flow particle that passes very close to the barrier and with its _ x_-axis in the flow direction .",
    "initially , that system will be aligned with the coordinates mentioned above . as time goes on",
    "after the particle has passed the _ y - z _ plane , the local system will , on average , rotate around its _ y_-axis .",
    "one can see in this way that the effects of this interaction with the stagnant molecules will propagate into the flow on the downstream side of the barrier .",
    "the result is a vortex .      in flight",
    ", an airplane will generate a vortex at each wingtip .",
    "these vortices are created as the higher pressure air under the wing leaks out from under the wing and away from the fuselage .",
    "the vortex is formed as this air is drawn into the low pressure region above the wing .",
    "the vortex is a nuisance and is a source of drag and instability due to the vortex impinging on the top of the wing there .",
    "it can actually reduce the overall lift .",
    "figure [ fig : wingtip_vortices ] shows the vortices very clearly .",
    "notice that the axes of these vortices are parallel to the flight direction .",
    "the wingtip vortices are an unwanted effect and are due to the necessity of finite - length wings .",
    "though the wingtip vortices are beautiful and spectacular , the concomitant to the most important factor in producing lift is the huge trench left in the cloud by the downwash off the trailing edges of the wings .",
    "the french jet engine manufacturing company , price induction sells small high bypass engines for small aircraft .",
    "one of their innovations is a turbofan using composite , non - metallic blades . at speed",
    ", the fan blades elongate and actually seal on the special bearing surface of the fan housing .",
    "the reason for this is to eliminate vortices at the vane tips .",
    "this reduces power requirements , increases the engine efficiency and increases thrust .",
    "though wingtip vortices are unwanted , similar vortices are created on purpose by so - called leading edge extension ( lex ) surfaces.@xcite a lex is a flat surface extending a short distance from the fuselage and from near the cockpit aft to the leading edge of the wing . at angle of attack vortices",
    "are created as the high - pressure air flows from below the lex to the lower pressure above .",
    "this causes the vortices , clockwise on the left side and counter - clockwise on the right .",
    "these vortices extend back over the wings and interrupt the stalling vortices that would otherwise form over the wing .",
    "they blow away the particles that would cause high pressure on the tops of the wings , especially near the roots .",
    "lexs allow the plane to operate at higher angles of attack than it otherwise could .",
    "the high - speed camera shows some very interesting aspects of birds taking flight.@xcite perhaps the most interesting is that on take - off , when maximum lift is needed , a bird s power stroke is down and _ forward _ , not backward as it would do if it were `` swimming '' in the air .",
    "this motion both pressurizes the air under the wing and creates upwash ] on the leading edges of its wings .",
    "this upwash flows over the leading edge and actually contributes to lowering the pressure on the top of the wing .    on aircraft , the leading edge slots and slats",
    "are designed to control and make use of upwash . trailing edge flaps act like the big feathers on the trailing edges of a bird s wings .",
    "they help trap the flow and thus increase pressure under the wing and they also extend the wing s curved surface and hence the region of low pressure on the top of the wing .",
    "for an incompressible fluid in _ steady_@xcite flow , a simple expression for the conservation of energy was derived by daniel bernoulli in 1737 in his book _ `` hydrodynamica''_. in steady flow , the fluid can be enveloped in an actual or virtual tube .",
    "that means that at any cross - section perpendicular to the tube s walls , the fluid has a uniform velocity across the tube , i.e. there can be no shear in the fluid .",
    "fluid neither leaves nor enters through the wall of the tube and the particles do not interact with each other or with the wall of the tube . and",
    "finally , since the flow must be laminar , the tubes themselves , actual or abstract , are restricted to a smooth , gently varying shape .",
    "these assumptions preclude turbulence or eddy formation .",
    "if these conditions hold to a good approximation , bernoulli s equation holds .",
    "if such a tube can not be drawn , the equation does not hold .",
    "bernoulli s equation allows the calculation of general behavior but because of these assumptions the theory is not able to predict other aspects of aerodynamics , such as behavior in the boundary layer of a surface in the flow .",
    "bernoulli s equation is :    @xmath48    where    * @xmath28 is the absolute pressure , * @xmath1 is the density of the fluid , * @xmath49 is the acceleration due to gravity , * @xmath50 is the height in the gravitational field and * @xmath51 is the velocity vector for a cell in the flow small enough so that the velocities of the particles in the cell are approximately equal .",
    "note that the assumption that the flow consists of these cells amounts to the fluid approximation . in the particle",

    "just because a fluid is flowing does not mean that the pressure within the fluid has decreased .",
    "velocity is relative to the inertial frame where it is measured but pressure is a quantity independent of the inertial frame where it is measured .",
    "the pressure in a fluid is measured as the momentum transfer of the fluid particles striking some transducer that produces a pointer reading .",

    "will show that the speed is measured as the difference in pressure between pressure sensor areas that are normal to one another in the same flow .",
    "( in the figure , @xmath29 is the velocity of the aircraft . )",
    "a pitot tube is a device to measure air speed , i.e. the velocity of the tube with respect to the local ambient air . if the tube is correctly mounted on an aircraft flying in air that is not moving with respect to the earth , it measures , after altitude correction , the ground speed of the aircraft .",
    "it s design makes use of bernoulli s relation .",
    "it actually consists of two concentric tubes .",

    "a close examination of one design of a pitot tube will reveal small holes in the side of the exterior tube .",
    "these holes are exposed to the air flow . in order for the device to work correctly",
    ", it is very important that the surfaces of these holes be parallel to the flow so there is no ram pressure or rarefaction of the air there .",
    "it is the pressure in the outer tube that is compared to the ram pressure in the center tube .",
    "this pressure remains at ambient no matter what the air speed , even zero .",
    "it is the ram pressure in the inner tube that changes as the airspeed changes .",
    "although bernoulli s equation employs densities as factors in the potential and kinetic energy terms , the equation in this form is only valid when the fluid can be assumed incompressible and non - viscous because compression heating and viscous interactions create heat energy . to account for this energy",
    ", thermodynamics would have to enter the equation and a thermodynamic process be identified .",
    "this process could vary in many different ways , depending in detail on the specific case .",
    "it is for this reason that there is no heating term in bernoulli s equation .",
    "if compression is significant , bernoulli s equation in this form can not be expected to hold .      strictly speaking",
    ", bernoulli s equation does not apply over a real free surface because particles will move lateral to the flow after striking protuberances on the surface , violating a bernoulli assumption .",
    "think of a pressure vessel of a non - viscous gas feeding a bernoulli tube ( a real one , glass ) . before flow starts",
    ", the energy in the vessel is equally distributed between the 3 degrees of freedom . when the fluid is vented into the tube ,",
    "the pressure in the tube is less than that in the vessel .",
    "the reason that the pressure in the exit tube is less than in the vessel is that the only particles that exit into the tube are those with velocity components in the exit direction .",
    "of course these particles exert a transverse pressure lower than that of the vessel since they are selected for their momentum components being outward into the tube .",
    "because energy is conserved , these particles initial energy density is now apportioned between pressure on the walls of the tube ( the pressure read by manometer ) and the kinetic energy density of their velocity in the tube , @xmath61 .",
    "this means that there will be a lower manometer reading in the exit pipe than in the vessel .",
    "the pressure difference between the vessel and the end of the exit pipe allows the flow of the exiting particles . at the particle level , bernoulli s equation , where the exit tube is in the x - direction , is :    @xmath62    where the sums are over the velocities of the all particles in the flow and @xmath63 is the pressure at the tube wall .    at the exit orifice",
    ", it is just those particles that are moving toward the hole that actually exit .",

    "say further that the fluid flow is isothermal and inviscid , i.e. steady , and that all collisions , particle - particle and particle - wall are perfectly elastic .",
    "this means that bernoulli s equation holds approximately , i.e. energy density is conserved in the flow and the volumes @xmath70 and @xmath71 are equal since the mass flow rate conserved .    what does this mean at the particle level ?",
    "a manometer reading is caused by the transfer of momentum of particles impinging on its transducer , i.e. a column of liquid , a diaphragm or some other object whose reaction is converted to a pointer reading . these recording devices",
    "convert the transfer of the particles transverse momenta to a force normal to the transducing surface .    when an orifice is opened in a pressure vessel , it sorts out and allows to exit those particles which are at the orifice and which have velocity components in the direction of the plane of the orifice .",
    "the components of the exiting particles velocities normal to the surface will necessarily be smaller than those of particles which do not exit .",
    "( see equation ) if a manometer is fitted to an orifice in the wall of the tube , the transverse pressure can be measured at the entrance .",
    "as the tube s diameter decreases , there is a further sorting process so that the pressure in that section is lower still .",
    "particles in the tube that are outside the imaginary projection of the narrow tube back into the larger section , will strike the curving wall of the neck and interact with other particles .",
    "they bounce off elastically with undiminished energy and with a change of momentum .",
    "they will then energize the particles near the small - diameter exit tube .",
    "the result of these interactions is the conservation of energy and the transfer of the energy in the annulus to the particles in the smaller tube .    rewriting equation with @xmath72 and adding some more detail , we get    @xmath73    ,    where the sums are over the particles in @xmath71 and @xmath70 respectively . with the main fluid velocity in the @xmath74direction , the conservation of mass yields    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the average velocity component .",

    "this effect , first investigated and employed by the romanian aerodynamics engineer henri marie coand ( 1886  1972 ) , is the phenomenon in which an air flow attaches to an adjacent wall which curves away from this flow .",
    "( see @xcite pp .",
    "42 , 664 ) .",
    "in fact this effect is taken for granted and it is the _ separation _ of the flow from an aerodynamic body that is discussed as a precursor to the stalling of the surface ( @xcite p. 40 ) .",
    "the effect can be seen in some automobile advertisements .",
    "streamers of smoke are seen to hug the profile of a car in a wind tunnel even as the surface of the car curves away from the flow .",
    "this behavior indicates a lower pressure that aerodynamicists call _ suction _ at that part of the surface .",
    "the coand effect is exploited in the design of large flue pipes in some pipe organs .",
    "these pipes are like huge whistles and can , if they are overblown , sound the octave rather than the fundamental tone .",

    "much of the awesome power of the grand organ , however , comes from the volume of the bass notes .",
    "the pipe sounds when a sheet of air is blown over the mouth .",
    "some of this air enters the pipe and of course it must also exit .",
    "the only exit from these closed pipes is the mouth itself .",

    "a beard is a circular dowel mounted between the ears on each side of the mouth .",
    "as the air exits , it tends to flow in the general direction of the beard but the beard is located so that the main flow passes _ over _ it . as the surface of the beard curves away from the flow ,",
    "a low pressure is created on the top of the beard .",
    "this low pressure area attracts the flow and keeps it from interfering with the flow entering the pipe .",
    "figure [ fig : beard ] illustrates this .",
    "henri coand held many patents but perhaps the most interesting for aerodynamic design is his design of a propelling device @xcite .",
    "the patent disclosure is appendix [ coandaapp ] .",
    "the device develops lift as an enhanced buoyant force produced by decreased pressure on the top .",
    "this decreased pressure on the curved circular surface is caused by a flow of gas at high - pressure exhausting tangentially to an annular airfoil from an annular slit .",
    "in addition to enhancing the buoyant force , the device would remove the bow wave that would hinder the motion of the device .",
    "a bow wave is normally formed when an object moves through a fluid .",
    "it is easy to see the bow wave of a ship or barge .",
    "as it is propelled in the water , a ship must push water out of the way . because the water has mass ,",
    "force is required to move it . by",
    "newton s third law , there is an equal and opposite force exerted on the ship .",
    "this effect causes drag in addition to the viscous drag of the hull of the ship as it moves through the water .",
    "a toy helium balloon rises much more slowly than if it were nt hindered by a bow wave in the air .",
    "it is primarily the force of the bow wave that is responsible for the phenomenon of _ terminal velocity_. by extending his arms and legs , a skydiver can control the terminal velocity , increasing or decreasing it .",
    "figures 1 and 3 of appendix [ coandaapp ] illustrate the dissipation of the bow wave by the coand propelling device .",
    "lift is caused by the collisions of fluid particles with the surface of the airfoil . by",
    "newton s third law , this interaction of the particles with the surface results in an equal and opposite reaction on the airflow itself ; the particles bounce back .",
    "say , for example , that the lift force is in the  up \" direction , then the third law force on the air is  down . \"",
    "the lift can be represented in two ways : 1 ) as the summation of all the forces on the surface or , according to newton s third law , 2 ) by the negative of the force the surface exerts on the air .",
    "the latter is the approach that led to the kutta - joukowski theorem .",
    "figure [ fig : forces_hepperle ] shows a typical force configuration on the surface of an airfoil.@xcite the air flow is from the left .",
    "note that the primary contribution to the lift is from the curved surface of the _ top _ of the wing .",
    "the so - called _ suction _ created there also causes the coand effect .",
    "the flow particles far from the airfoil s surface `` feel ''",
    "this suction as a sort of reverse bow wave and , as a result , flow toward the surface . the low pressure , maintained by the flow past the curved surface , results in a pressure gradient , @xmath84 that decreases to zero as @xmath85 increases .",
    "the pressure approaches the limit @xmath86 the ambient pressure .",
    "@xmath85 is the normal distance from the airfoil s surface .",
    "another interesting aspect of this figure is the indication of a ( conventional ) bow wave of positive pressure just below the leading edge .",
    "this bow wave results in an upwash that moves against the main flow to join the flow above the leading edge stagnation point . at high angles of attack",
    "this flow causes a vortex on the top of the wing which becomes larger as the angle of attack and/or the flow velocity increases .",
    "this vortex interferes with the suction on top of the wing and if too large will eventually cause stall .",
    "vortex generators , sometimes mounted on wings and control surfaces,@xcite in spite of their name , inhibit the formation of this span - wise vortex .",
    "they do this by generating small vortices emanating from their tips .",
    "these small vortices , for angles of attack not too large , break up the larger span - wise vortex before it forms .",
    "the axes of these vortices are in the direction of the flow .",
    "a common stall warning device is a switch activated by a simple flap mounted on the leading edge protruding forward , which , when it gets blown upward , causes a horn in the cockpit to sound .",
    "all stall warning devices are activated , directly or indirectly by the speed of the upwash.@xcite upwash is created by the viscous interaction of the air with the lower surface of the wing .",
    "it can be seen as a stream of water from a faucet strikes a plate held at an angle to the stream .",
    "some of the water flows upward before it finally turns and flows down the plate .",
    "if the plate is held so the stream is near the top , the upwash will actually run up and over the top of the plate . as we will see in sections [ slots ] and [ birds ] , this upwash can be turned to advantage to increase lift .",
    "the total force on the wing , lift plus drag ( the red arrow in figure  [ fig : forces_hepperle ] ) is the vector sum :    @xmath87    where    * @xmath88 is the force normal to the surface and * @xmath89 is the force tangent to the surface .",
    "the minus sign is necessary because we are calculating force on the air and use newton s third law to relate that to the total lift force , @xmath90 on the surface .",

    "the pressure exerts a force in equal magnitude and opposite direction on the air and the airfoil .",

    "the minus sign is required by newton s third law since we are interested in the force on the airfoil .",
    "the behavior of the air near the surface of the airfoil is very complex and chaotic but because at angles of attack less than the stall angle , this layer , the boundary layer , is very thin compared to @xmath95 this complexity is not important .",
    "it is similar to the behavior in the bow wave of a boat .",
    "the water is turbulent and moving in a very complex way at the prow but some small distance away the water begins to smooth out into regular waves that fan out as the boat passes .",
    "the information as to the detailed behavior in the boundary layer has been lost to heat due to the viscosity of the water .",

    "the diffuser , then , extracts work from the gases before they exit beyond the rocket .",
    "the analogous situation in an internal combustion engine is to delay the opening of the exhaust valves in order to extract more work from the hot gas in the combustion chamber .",
    "an interesting feature of some diffusers , like those of the french ariane rocket , is a sort of rifling on the diffuser wall .",
    "this rifling causes the gases to swirl , thus increasing the path length for the exiting particles .",

    "examination of the third panel of figure [ fig : wingflow ] shows how the presence of a curved surface in an air flow causes what might be called coand entrainment of air from outside .",
    "this entrainment compresses the air _ in front _ of the fan so that the fan is moving air of an increased density , @xmath149 this increased density and the boost in velocity provided by the fan results in an increase in thrust pressure @xmath150    a similar coand entrainment enhances the performance of the shrouded tail rotors ( figure [ fig : ducted_fan_tailrotor ] ) that are used on some helicopters.@xcite figure [ fig : ducted_fan_tailrotor ] is used with the kind permission of burkhard domke .",
    "a device called a vortex refrigerator consists of a cylindrical chamber into one end of which a gas is injected tangentially .",
    "gas is then drawn off , cold , from the axis of the cylinder and hot from its periphery . along the length of the cylinder",
    "the cold molecules are separated from the hot by the vortex process outlined in figure [ fig : vortexprocess ] .",
    "the temperature of the cold air exiting from a vortex generator can be substantially below that of the compressed air at the inlet .",
    "although the vortex process described above would serve as a sort of `` maxwell s dmon '' to separate the cold particles from the hot there may be some other process that changes the distribution of the particles energies , e.g. increases it variance .",
    "it is easy to imagine that some of the translational energy of the inlet air would be converted into heat of the exhausting air but it is more difficult to understand how the cold air exiting could be as much as @xmath151 centigrade below the inlet temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the measured temperature is a macroscopic quantity .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the inlet energy distribution , i.e. kinetic plus heat , is the sum of the cold and hot exhaust distributions .",
    "the centers of hurricanes are regions of low pressure . in the great hurricane of 1900 that struck galveston , texas ,",
    "the pressure was the lowest ever recorded up to that time , 936 millibars .",
    "the pressure recorded in the eye of hurricane katrina which hit the coast of the gulf of mexico in 2005 was even lower than this at 920 millibars .",
    "if the hurricane is over water , this low pressure causes _ storm surge . _",
    "the water in the center of the hurricane is pushed up because of the low pressure there and the higher pressure outside the center . in the case of galveston and hurricane katrina and most other hurricanes ,",
    "this storm surge caused most of the damage to the cities .",
    "the mechanism that causes the structure of hurricanes and cyclones is not fully understood but it certainly is a result of complex particle interactions .",
    "the flow is definitely not steady so bernoulli s equation will not hold .",
    "the magnus effect is well - known by players of tennis , ping - pong , baseball , soccer and volleyball .",
    "it is illustrated in figure [ fig : magnus ] .",
    "discovered by heinrich gustav magnus ( 1802 - 1870 ) , the magnus effect has been used to power a ship across the atlantic .",
    "a rotating object in a flow will generate a differential pressure which will produce a force on the object normal to its spin axis .",
    "the pressure is higher on the side rotating into the flow than on the side rotating with the flow .",
    "the effect is caused as the boundary layer dragged along by the object is pressurized by the main flow .",
    "this pressurization is caused by the collisions of the flow particles with the boundary layer particles and the surface structure of the object .",
    "the furry surface of a new tennis ball enhances this effect .",
    "another means of pressurizing the boundary layer , used on some formula one race cars , is the gurney flap .",
    "although the gurney flap was actually invented by edward f. zaparka in the 1930s@xcite , race driver and race car builder dan gurney accidentally rediscovered it in 1971 .",
    "the height of simplicity , it is a length of aluminum angle iron bolted to the trailing edge of an airfoil .",
    "it causes an increased pressure on the side of the airfoil from which it projects .",
    "it is easy to see that it functions as a dam , trapping air from the flow , thus increasing the pressure on the top of the airfoil .",
    "this is done to increase the force down on the wheels , decreasing the chance for wheel spin and increasing traction for the rear wheels .",
    "ordinary fowler flaps@xcite , common on commercial airliners , cause a similar damming of the flow on takeoff and landing , where maximum lift is needed .",
    "the top surface of a fowler flap also utilizes the coand effect to enhance lift .",
    "`` slotted '' fowler flaps direct some of the high - pressure air under the wing over the rear flap sections , thus enhancing the coand effect there .",
    "a slot@xcite is a gap between a slat , in use at the leading edge of a wing , and between the sections of the fowler flaps .        on takeoff and landing , some airliners , in addition to fowler flaps ,",
    "use leading edge slats and slots@xcite .",
    "designs differ from manufacturer to manufacturer but a leading edge mechanism of some kind is always incorporated into the design of the wings of airliners .",
    "leading edge slats and slots direct the upwash from the bottom of the wing at angle of attack over the leading edge of the airfoil .",
    "a simple experiment will demonstrate upwash .",
    "hold a flat plate at a @xmath152 or @xmath153 angle with respect to a smooth stream of water .",
    "as the water strikes it , it climbs up the plate against the direction of the water flow .",
    "this effect is due to the interaction of the water molecules with the microscopic protuberances on the surface of the plate .",
    "another way of stating this is to say that the effect is due to the viscosity of the water .",
    "as the slat descends into the air flowing beneath the wing , it opens a slot .",
    "( see the 4th panel of figure ( [ fig : flaps ] . )",
    "this combination directs the upwash air smoothly onto the top surface of the wing causing a coand effect there which increases lift . instead of slots and slats , some airbus planes use vortex spoilers on the leading edges of their wings .",
    "these spoilers , like slats , are deployed only on takeoff and landing and serve to prevent a stalling vortex from forming along the leading edge of the wing .",
    "this paper begins an investigation into how a fluid consisting of particles interacts with itself and with solid surfaces .",
    "although the mathematics of fluid dynamics is beautiful , it fails to explain many mysteries that appear in the behavior of common subsonic flows .",
    "many physics books , for example , attempt to explain the phenomenon of subsonic lift by using bernoulli s equation .",
    "it is hoped that the brief treatment above will disabuse the reader from such an explanation .",
    "anyone who has contemplated ocean waves in their magnificence or watched solitons marching upstream in channel flow can not but be amazed at the beauty exhibited by the behavior of fluids , this in spite of difficulties that defy our ability to calculate their detailed behavior .",
    "it is said that the first stage of understanding a phenomenon is that of its careful observation .",
    "perhaps the next is to attempt to formulate the behavior of the constituents of the phenomenon .",
    "prior to the turn of the 19th century , it was believed that fluids were fundamental entities , i.e. not composed of anything . since einstein s 1905 paper on brownian motion ,",
    "however , it has been clear that fluids are composed of molecules .",
    "to assume , then , at least for the sake of investigation , that all fluid behavior is caused by the interactions of these molecules and those of solid surfaces immersed in the fluid , seems natural .",
    "these assumptions are useful even in the absence of a tractable mathematics to describe behavior at this level .",
    "the current mathematical approaches , including the navier - stokes equations , make the fluid assumption@xcite fundamental .",
    "some of the most baffling behavior of fluids , however , takes place in regimes where the fluid assumption is not valid .",
    "perhaps , as computers become faster and with more and more memory , some of these behaviors will succumb to calculation . in the meantime we observe and contemplate and we are amazed .",
