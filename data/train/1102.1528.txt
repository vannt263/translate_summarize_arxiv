    "<S> explicit relations between the effective - range expansion and the nuclear vertex constant or asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) for the virtual decay @xmath0 are derived for an arbitrary orbital momentum together with the corresponding location condition for the ( @xmath1 ) bound - state energy . </S>",
    "<S> they are valid both for the charged case and for the neutral case . combining these relations with the standard effective - range function up to order six </S>",
    "<S> makes it possible to reduce to two the number of free effective - range parameters if an anc value is known from experiment . </S>",
    "<S> values for the scattering length , effective range , and form parameter are determined in this way for the @xmath2o+@xmath3 , @xmath4+@xmath5 and @xmath4+@xmath6he collisions in partial waves where a bound state exists by using available ancs deduced from experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective - range expansions for these collisions are valid up to energies larger 5 mev . </S>"
