    "nowadays , more than two hundreds superdeformed ( sd ) bands are identified in various mass ( @xmath8=60 , 80 , 130 , 150 , 190 ) regions @xcite .",
    "every sd regions have their own characteristics so that we can significantly enlarge and deepen our understanding of nuclear structure by systematically investigating similarities and differences among the sd bands in different mass region .",
    "the sd shell structure is significantly different from that of normal deformation .",
    "namely , each major shell at the sd shape consists of about equal numbers of positive- and negative - parity levels .",
    "this is a favourable situation for the appearance of negative - parity collective modes .",
    "in fact , various mean - field calculations @xcite and quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite on the basis of the rotating mean field ( cranked shell model ) indicated that sd nuclei are very soft against both the axial and non - axial octupole deformations .",
    "thus , low - frequency octupole vibrations have been predicted to appear near the sd yrast lines @xcite , and recently discovered in experiments for heavy sd nuclei in the hg - pb region @xcite , and also in @xmath9dy @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the sd bands have been discovered also in the @xmath1ca region : in @xmath3ar the sd band has been identified up to its termination at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the sd band in the spherical doubly magic nucleus @xmath1ca is built on the 8p-8h excited @xmath11 state at 5.213 mev @xcite .",
    "the sd shell gap at @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is associated with the neutron ( proton ) 4p-4h excitation from below the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) spherical closed shell to the @xmath14 shell . the rotational band built on the excited @xmath11 state at 1.905 mev in @xmath4ti",
    "may also be regarded as belonging to a family of the sd band @xcite . the fact that rotational bands built on excited @xmath11 states are systematically observed is a unique feature of the sd bands in the @xmath1ca region , considering that the low angular momentum portions of the sd bands in heavy nuclei are unknown in almost all cases ( except the fission isomers ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the symmetry - unrestricted skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) calculation indeed yields the sd local minima corresponding to these experimental data @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that , in spite of the remarkable progress in experiment , the doubly magic sd band in @xmath2s associated with the sd magic number @xmath15=@xmath16=16 , which has been anticipated quite a long time @xcite , has not yet been observed and remains as a great challenge .    if we believe that @xmath16=16 is a good sd magic number , the existence of the sd shell gap at @xmath12 , revealed by the discovery of the sd band in @xmath1ca @xcite , suggests that another sd band would appear in the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath3s .",
    "furthermore , combining with the fact that the sd bands have been observed in @xmath17zn @xcite , we can expect that sulfur isotopes around @xmath18s , which are situated close to the neutron - drip line @xcite , constitute a new sd region associated with the sd shell gaps at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the symmetry - unrestricted shf calculation @xcite yields the sd local minima for @xmath6s as well as @xmath2s .",
    "the investigation of low - frequency octupole vibrations built on the sd states in the @xmath8=30 - 50 region possesses some new features that are absent in the study of heavy sd nuclei . for the @xmath0 nuclei in the @xmath1ca region",
    ", it may be possible to observe in experiment such collective modes built on the known sd @xmath11 states .",
    "moreover , because the proton and neutron shell structures are essentially the same , we can expect that strong coherence takes place between the proton and neutron excitations and brings about an enhanced collectivity of these modes . concerning the anticipated new sd region around @xmath18s",
    ", we will encounter an essentially new situation : because these nuclei are situated close to the neutron drip line , there is almost no bound state above the fermi surface and nucleons may excite into the continuum states even in the lowest excited states .",
    "the study of soft collective modes unique to unstable nuclei close to the neutron drip line is one of the current major subjects in nuclear structure physics . for this purpose ,",
    "the continuum rpa @xcite based on the green s function method correctly treating the continuum boundary condition has been widely used ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . recently",
    ", this method has been extended @xcite to include the pairing correlations on the basis of the hartree - fock - bogoluibov theory .",
    "it is called the continuum quasiparticle - rpa ( qrpa ) .",
    "furthermore , a new technique of solving the qrpa equations using the canonical basis has been developed @xcite .",
    "the canonical basis has also been used in the qrpa calculation based on the relativistic mean field scheme @xcite .",
    "a serious limitation of these works is that , because the construction of the green s function for deformed mean fields is difficult , they are restricted to spherical nuclei .",
    "quite recently , however , this limitation has been overcome by nakatsukasa and yabana @xcite ; they have proposed an iterative method of constructing the response functions for deformed systems with the proper boundary condition in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) coordinate space .",
    "they have also proposed a feasible method of treating the continuum boundary condition by means of the real - space time - dependent hf approach with the absorbing boundary condition .    in this paper , we investigate low - frequency octupole excitations built on the sd states in neutron rich sulfur isotopes as well as those in the @xmath1ca region . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the mixed representation rpa @xcite based on the shf mean field . in this rpa scheme , the _ particles _ above the fermi surface are described in the coordinate representation , while the _ holes _ are represented in the hf single - particle basis . the rpa calculation is carried out fully self - consistently on the 3d cartesian mesh in a box .",
    "the major advantage of this approach is that it is a fully self - consistent scheme in the sense that the same effective interaction is used in both the mean field and the rpa calculations ; i.e. , all terms of the skyrme interaction contributing to the rpa equations of motion are taken into account .",
    "it should be stressed here that such a fully self - consistent calculation using the skyrme - type interaction is difficult in the green s function approach , so that , usually , the residual particle - hole interactions associated with the spin - orbit and coulomb interactions , as well as those associated with the time - odd components ( related to the spin and current densities ) of the mean field , are ignored in the continuum rpa based on the shf mean field .",
    "another important merit of our approach is that , thanks to the use of the 3d cartesian mesh representation , we can treat strongly deformed nuclei on the same footing as spherical nuclei .",
    "furthermore , because the _ particles _ are described in the coordinate representation , we do not need to introduce an upper cut off for their energies .",
    "quite recently , imagawa and hashimoto constructed a new computer code that carries out the fully self - consistent rpa calculation in the mixed representation on the basis of the shf mean field , and they carefully tested its numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations of this paper were carried out using a refined version this code .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , a brief account of the self - consistent rpa calculation using the mixed representation is given . in section 3 ,",
    "we present and discuss the results of numerical calculation for low - frequency octupole vibrations built on the sd states in @xmath0 nuclei , @xmath2s , @xmath3ar , @xmath1ca , and @xmath4ti . in section 4 ,",
    "the results for neutron - rich sulfur isotopes , @xmath3s , @xmath18s , and @xmath21s , are presented and discussed .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in section 5 .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was reported in refs .",
    "the rpa equations in the mixed representation are easily derived either by means of the lineralized equations of motion approach @xcite or the small - amplitude approximation of the time - dependent hf theory @xcite . here",
    ", we recapitulate the basic formula following the former approach .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of nucleon , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are divided into those for the bound states and those for the continuum states : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes a set of space , spin and isospin coordinates , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "the symbol @xmath27 denotes the hf bound states with wave functions @xmath28 , while the energy @xmath29 specifies the continuum states with wave functions @xmath30 . with the use of the _ particle _ and _ hole _ concepts",
    ", we then divide the nucleon operators according to the occupation number @xmath31 in the hf ground state ( @xmath32 for unoccupied states , @xmath33 for occupied states ) .",
    "we consider even - even nuclei and assume that the single - particle states @xmath27 and their time reversed states are doubly degenerated .",
    "obviously , the continuum states belong to the particle space . on the other hand , for the bound states",
    ", the operators ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) are divided into the particle operators ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and the hole operators ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 where the indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 are used in place of @xmath27 to distinguish the particle and hole states .",
    "thus , the particle creation and annihilation operators , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , at the coordinate @xmath25 are written in terms of the above ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and the integration with respect to the positive energy @xmath29 specifying the continuum states ; @xmath45 in the mixed representation , the coordinate representation is used for particles , while the hf basis specified by the discrete index @xmath42 are used for holes .",

    "based on the numerical test explained below , we adopt the mesh spacing @xmath68 fm . because we treat the superdeformed nuclei , we use the rectangular box with 15 and 25 mesh points in the positive directions of the minor and major axes , respectively , i.e. , we take the mesh points at @xmath69 fm , @xmath70 fm and @xmath71 fm ( the major axis is called the @xmath72-axis ) .",

    "the rpa eigen - value equations are separated into four blocks specified by the parity quantum numbers .",

    "moreover , in deformed nuclei , except for the @xmath82 sector , these spurious modes can mix with the octupole modes having the same symmetry properties ( see table [ table : symmetry ] for the classification of the dipole operators corresponding to the center of mass motion ) .",
    "it is therefore very important to carefully check the accuracy of numerical calculation whether or not the spurious center of motions are decoupled from the physical excitations in a good approximation . in the numerical calculation",

    "we see that a good convergence is attained at about @xmath90 fm , although excitation energies of the spurious center of mass modes fluctuate in the region of @xmath91 fm .",
    "it should be noted that the excitation energies of the physical excitation modes and their transition strengths almost converge for @xmath92 fm .",

    "thus , the present rpa calculation suggests that the appearance of the @xmath112 doublet may serve as a good indicator of the triaxial nature of the sd state of @xmath4ti .",
    "experimental search for such a doublet on top of the sd band head seems very interesting .",
    "figure [ rpa_unpert.s.siii.sd ] displays the transition strength distributions obtained by the shf - rpa calculation with the siii interaction for low - frequency octupole excitations built on the sd states in @xmath129s .",
    "let us first discuss the result of calculation for the neutron - rich @xmath3s . for this nucleus , we obtain a @xmath5 mode at 2.6 mev and a @xmath107 mode at 4.2 mev . as they possess the isoscalar octupole transition strengths of 13 w.u . and 16 w.u .",
    ", respectively , they are moderately collective ( 1 w.u . @xmath108 77 @xmath109 for @xmath3s ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with those for @xmath2s and @xmath1ca discussed in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath115 mode in this nucleus is similar to the @xmath115 mode in @xmath1ca , but its transition strength is less than half of the latter .",
    "this reduction of the collectivity is understood in terms of the weakening of the coherence between the proton and neutron excitations when one goes from the @xmath0 nucleus to the @xmath122 nucleus .",
    "looking into the microscopic details , we find that , for example , the particle - hole excitations of protons and neutrons from the @xmath111 $ ] level to the @xmath118 $ ] level act coherently to produce the @xmath5 collective mode in @xmath1ca , but this proton excitation is absent in the case of @xmath3s because the @xmath111 $ ] level is unoccupied .",
    "analogous argument also applies to the @xmath107 mode .",
    "this mode is similar to the @xmath112 mode in @xmath2s , but , its transition strength is about half of the latter .",
    "this is understood again in terms of the weakening of the coherence between the proton and neutron excitations .",
    "for instance , the particle - hole excitations of protons and neutrons from the @xmath110 $ ] level to the @xmath111 $ ] level act coherently to produce the @xmath107 collective mode in @xmath2s , but this neutron excitation is absent in the case of @xmath3s because the @xmath111 $ ] level is already occupied .",
    "next , let us discuss the result of calculation for @xmath18s and @xmath21s close to the neutron - drip line . for @xmath18s",
    ", we obtain a @xmath5 mode at very low excitation energy , 0.51 mev .",
    "this mode possesses a large octupole transition strength of 31 w.u .",
    "( 1 w.u . @xmath108 137 @xmath109 for @xmath18s ) .",
    "the rpa eigen - energy is shifted down only slightly ( 0.14 mev ) from the unperturbed energy ( 0.65 mev ) of the neutron excitation from the @xmath130 $ ] level to the @xmath131 $ ] level .",
    "the unperturbed transition strength for this single - particle excitation is extremely large , i.e. , @xmath132 w.u . the major cause of this remarkable strength is understood as follows : both the @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 $ ] levels are loosely bound with binding energy about 2 mev .",
    "because , as is well known , wave functions of the loosely bound states are significantly extended outside of the half - density radius , the matrix element of the octupole operator between these configurations acquires a large contribution from the region outside of the nuclear surface .",
    "thus , such a transition strength can become very large in nuclei close to the neutron drip .",
    "although the increase of the rpa transition strength from the unperturbed strength indicates the presence of collective effects , it may be appropriate to consider that the major character of this mode is of single - particle - type .",
    "in contrast to the low energy peak at 0.51 mev discussed above , the peaks above the neutron - emission threshold ( indicated by arrows in fig .  [ rpa_unpert.s.siii.sd ] ) are considered to be associated with the excitations to discretized non - resonant continuum states .",
    "we examined that these peaks in the continuum indeed moves when we increase the box size in the numerical calculation .",
    "therefore , we can not give definite physical meanings to these peaks .",
    "for @xmath21s , we obtain a @xmath107 mode at 2.5 mev . like the @xmath5 mode in @xmath18s",
    ", it is essentially a single - particle - type excitation , although it has extremely large octupole transition strength , 55 w.u .",
    "( 1 w.u . @xmath108 149 @xmath109 for @xmath21s ) .",
    "namely , it is created mainly by the neutron excitation from the loosely bound @xmath131 $ ] level to the resonance @xmath133 $ ] level .",
    "the rpa eigen - energy of this mode is shifted down only slightly ( 0.5 mev ) from the unperturbed excitation energy ( 3.0 mev ) of this particle - hole configuration .",
    "because the resonance @xmath133 $ ] level is situated near the centrifugal barrier top , its wave function is significantly extended far out side of the half - density radius of this nucleus .",
    "thus , the unperturbed octupole transition strength for this particle - hole excitation takes an extremely large value , @xmath134 w.u .",
    "this resonance interpretation of the @xmath133 $ ] level is largely based on the analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite where the deformed woods - saxon potential simulating our shf potential was constructed and properties of the discretized continuum states for this potential are analysed in detail .",
    "it was then found that the energy and the root - mean - square radius of this level were stable against the variation of the box size . in the same paper , this conclusion was confirmed also by carrying out the eigenphase analysis for this level . the appearance of this resonance level is easily understood as due to the rather high centrifugal barrier for the relatively large value of the symmetry axis component of the angular momentum , @xmath135 .",
    "we confirmed that this @xmath112 peak at 2.5 mev does not move but the other peaks moves when we increase the box size in the numerical calculation .",
    "thus , like in @xmath18s , except for the @xmath112 peak , the peaks above the the neutron - emission threshold are considered to be associated with the excitations to discretized non - resonant continuum states .",
    "we also carried out the same kind of calculation using the skm@xmath75@xcite and the sly4@xcite interactions .",
    "the results of calculations with different versions of the skyrme interaction are compared in fig .",
    "[ rpa.s ] . for",
    "the sly4 interaction , the sd local minimum does not appear in @xmath18s , so that the rpa calculation was not done for this nucleus . except for this , these skyrme interactions yield qualitatively similar results for the @xmath5 and @xmath107 modes .    to accurately describe the spatially extended wave functions , like the loosely bound levels and resonance levels in @xmath18s and @xmath21s discussed above , it is certainly desirable to use a bigger box in the numerical calculation .",
    "although it is difficult to significantly enlarge the box size under the present situation of computing power , we plan to manipulate this problem by incorporating the adaptive coordinate method into our scheme of numerical calculation .",
    "we believe , however , that the qualitative features of the present rpa calculation will remain valid .",
    "we have not obtained well - developed collective octupole modes for @xmath18s and @xmath21s . in such unstable nuclei close to the neutron - drip line",
    ", there is almost no bound state above the fermi surface and neutrons are excited to the continuum states .",
    "it seems difficult to develop collective correlations among different particle - hole configurations under such situations .",
    "quite recently , however , one of the authors ( m. y. ) pointed out that the pairing correlations play an important role for the emergence of low - frequency collective modes in such drip - line nuclei @xcite . for studying such pairing effects for collective excitations",
    ", it will be interesting to extend the mixed representation rpa based on the shf mean field to that based on the shf - bogoliubov mean field .",
    "by means of the mixed representation rpa based on the shf mean field , we have investigated low - frequency octupole excitations on the sd states in the @xmath0 nuclei around @xmath1ca and the neutron - rich sulfur isotopes .",
    "the rpa calculation has been carried out on the 3d cartesian mesh in a box , and yielded a number of low - frequency octupole vibrations built on the sd states in @xmath2s , @xmath3ar , @xmath1ca and @xmath4ti . in particular , a strongly collective @xmath5 octupole vibration has been suggested to appear on top of the sd state in @xmath1ca . for @xmath6s close to the neutron drip line",
    ", we have found that the low - lying state created by the excitation of a single neutron from a loosely bound low @xmath7 level to a high @xmath7 resonance level acquires an extremely strong octupole transition strength due to the spatially very extended structure of the particle - hole wave functions .",
