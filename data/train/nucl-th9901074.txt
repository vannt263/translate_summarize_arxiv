    "three - nucleon ( 3n ) resonances have not yet been firmly established . the situation up to 1987 has been collected in  @xcite .",
    "a recent investigation  @xcite of the process @xmath0 found no evidence of a resonance state of three neutrons .",
    "earlier investigations  @xcite ,  @xcite pointed to resonances in the three neutron ( 3n ) and three proton ( 3p ) systems .",
    "the double charge exchange process on @xmath1 was also investigated in  @xcite criticizing previous work but pointing again to a 3n resonance , now around @xmath2  mev . for the nnp system",
    "an excited state around @xmath3  mev with a width of @xmath4  mev has been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "a variational study based on complex scaling and simplified nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces was carried through in  @xcite with the prediction of a 3n resonance at @xmath5  mev for a @xmath6 state .",
    "earlier theoretical studies  @xcite ,  @xcite might be useful in various aspects , but are not conclusive with respect to the actual position of 3n resonances .",
    "a virtual state of @xmath7 with the quantum numbers of the ground state has been investigated in  @xcite by analytically continuing the momentum space faddeev equation and even estimating three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) effects . in the framework of the hyperspherical harmonic method and using complex scaling with model potentials",
    "a subthreshold 3n resonance for @xmath8 has been located in  @xcite .",
    "recently mathematical foundations have been laid on the analytical continuation of the three - body faddeev equations into unphysical energy sheets  @xcite and an application thereof to the @xmath9 trimer appeared in  @xcite .",
    "it is a theoretical challenge to determine the locations of the lowest lying 3n resonances on unphysical sheets based on the most modern nuclear forces .",
    "those forces are very successful in describing 3n scattering observables  @xcite which leads to the expectation that the corresponding 3n hamiltonian will also locate 3n resonances with a high degree of reliability . like for the 3n bound state energy , where some theoretical underbinding results and 3nf s are used to bridge that gap to the data point , also 3n resonance positions",
    "might finally be fine - tuned in this manner .",
    "these future rigorous results would also be an important guidance for experiments and would clarify the hitherto controversial situation .    for the 3n system the bound state has been studied extensively in the last decades resulting in numerically precise and converged solutions of the 3n faddeev equations  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "energy eigenvalues and wave functions have been generated with most modern nuclear hamiltonians in momentum and coordinate space .",
    "also numerically exact solutions of 3n faddeev equations for continuum states with the same hamiltonians are now available in momentum space for a wide range of energies  @xcite .",
    "the first model solutions also in coordinate space appeared  @xcite and variational approaches matured and provide equally accurate solutions  @xcite .",
    "3n resonances , however , have not yet been investigated in a comparable rigorous manner and based on realistic nn forces to the best of our knowledge . in this article",
    "we would like to take first steps into such a direction .    in the two - nucleon ( 2n ) system the exact form of the wave function in configuration space",
    "is known outside the range of the potential . in the 3n system",
    "only asymptotic expansions are known  @xcite ,  @xcite and methods how to apply them with sufficient accuracy , for instance in faddeev equations , have still to be elaborated in that framework .",
    "there are first very promising results for 3n scattering above the 3n breakup threshold  @xcite though up to now only for simple s - wave model forces . to the best of our knowledge",
    "3n resonance wave functions , which asymptotically oscillate and grow exponentially , have not yet been determined as solutions of faddeev equations and realistic forces .",
    "first attempts in this direction have been done in  @xcite , however with very simple forces .    in this study",
    "we investigate 3-body resonances as solutions of configuration space faddeev equations .",
    "the largest obstacle to find the resonance positions with sufficient precision is the approximate form of the resonance boundary condition .",
    "ab initio it is not known at which coordinate values this form is valid with sufficient accuracy . for resonances",
    "this problem can be overcome in principle using the complex scaling method ( csm )  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "thereby all relative coordinates are `` rotated '' into the complex plane leading to bound - state like , exponentially decreasing resonance wave function .",
    "this `` rotation '' of the coordinates into the complex plane works well for problems in atomic physics with potentials of inverse power laws .",
    "it will be shown in this article that in nuclear physics a straighforward application of csm in the configuration space faddeev form leads to serious numerical problems when the usual realistic nn interactions of yukawa type and hard core behavior are used .",
    "whether feasible modifications thereof can be found remains to be seen .",
    "right now our experience is such , that the resonance energies can be gained with sufficient precision only if one does not leave the real r - axis and if one guaranties the exact boundary condition as close as possible by using a sufficient number of terms in its asymptotic form .    in section",
    "ii we explain in detail the problems encountered when one applies the csm to the nuclear resonances using the 2n system as a play ground .",
    "the exact knowledge of the boundary conditions for this system allows one to check assumptions which can later be applied to 3n resonances .",
    "the 3n equations and the method for their solution are presented in section iii . there",
    "we discuss results for 3 bosons interacting with simple , s - wave forces and more importantly for 3n s interacting via realistic neutron - neutron ( nn ) interactions .",
    "a summary is given in section iv .",
    "information on the technical performance can be found in the appendices a and b.",
    "searching resonances in a system of two - nucleons is a well defined problem and numerically well under control  @xcite . in spite of",
    "that we discuss it here and present some results due to its pedagogical simplicity , which enables us to present and test approaches which might be useful for finding resonances for three or more nucleons .",
    "in addition we can introduce our notation .",
    "the 2n resonances are associated with the poles of the s - matrix which are embedded in the fourth - quadrant of the complex k - plane ( re(k)@xmath10 , im(k)@xmath11 ) .",
    "they are solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation without incoming wave and the outgoing wave increasing exponentially at infinity .",
    "we introduce the coordinate space partial wave basis @xmath12 where @xmath13 and where the orbital angular momentum l and total spin s are coupled to the total angular momentum j. the isospin of the two nucleons is denoted by t. then the resonance wave function @xmath14 to a given j and t has the form @xmath15 it is written in terms of the reduced wave functions @xmath16 which fulfill the radial schrdinger equation @xmath17    the resonance conditions are such that @xmath18 has to be regular at the origin and purely outgoing . for the reduced amplitudes",
    "this amounts to @xmath19 and @xmath20 outside the range of the interaction . here",
    "@xmath21 is the spherical hankel function . as we shall demonstrate below it is mandatory to either use the exact form of the boundary condition ( [ eq5 ] ) or to take into account at least the leading orders to find the resonances in the 2n system with sufficient accuracy . in eq.([eq3 ] ) m is the nucleon mass and @xmath22 .",
    "the complex energy e is embedded in the lower half plane of the second energy sheet .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) apply also to bound states with real , negative eigenvalues e. the matrix elements of the nn interaction are defined in terms of @xmath23 by @xmath24    a method of solving eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is displayed in  @xcite .",
    "one chooses suitable grid points in @xmath25 and interpolates @xmath16 in terms of cubic splines . the boundary conditions ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) can be conveniently incorporated either by the absence of certain expansion coefficients in the spline expansion or by suitable relations among them . then choosing appropriate collocation points in @xmath25 one ends up with a homogeneous algebraic set of equations .",
    "they can be handled by standard methods  @xcite .    in systems with more than 2 nucleons",
    "the boundary conditions are known only via an asymptotic expansion and one has therefore to work with approximate boundary conditions .",
    "the knowledge of the exact resonance solutions in the 2n system allow now to study the question pivotal for 3n systems : how precisely does one need to know the boundary conditions in order to get the resonance energies with sufficient accuracy ? to study this problem one can use the series representation for the spherical hankel functions @xmath26 and write the resonance wave function outside the interaction region in a form which resembles the asymptotic boundary condition in the 3n system ( see section iii , eq.([eq21 ] ) ) @xmath27 with @xmath28 being unknown constants independent from k and r. here , contrary to the 3n system , the number of terms in the series is restricted by the orbital angular momenta contributing to the given total angular momentum j of a resonance .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present 2n resonance positions in different nn states where the exact boundary condition have been imposed at different matching radii outside the interaction region .",
    "the nn interaction reid93  @xcite has been used and has been multiplied with a factor @xmath29 ( shown in column 2 of table  [ table1 ] ) . using the exact boundary condition the resonance positions do not depend of course on the value of the matching radius . however , when the most crudely approximated boundary condition is applied , keeping in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) only the term with @xmath30 , the approximate resonance positions vary with the matching radius and up to @xmath31  fm the results are highly insufficient . as seen from table  [ table1 ] it is sufficient to get correct energy eigenvalues if one keeps only the two leading terms in the boundary condition ( [ eq8 ] ) ( for l=1 this is the exact form ) .    for resonances the problem of a possibly approximate nature of the boundary condition",
    "can be overcome in principle using the complex scaling method ( csm )  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "this will now be illustrated for 2 nucleons because of its simplicity . in the 2n system one",
    "replaces the relative coordinate r by @xmath32 for real positive angles @xmath33 the asymptotic form @xmath34 with @xmath35 can be changed to an exponentially decreasing function .",
    "therefore a resonance wave function analytically continued to those complex coordinates can be treated like a bound state with its well known boundary condition .",
    "then it is probably enough to restrict the boundary condition ( [ eq8 ] ) to the first term @xmath30 .",
    "this `` rotation '' of the coordinate into the complex plane is sufficient for problems in atomic physics with coulomb potentials . in nuclear physics",
    "the potentials decrease exponentially and the transformation ( [ eq9 ] ) turns then @xmath36 into @xmath37 .",
    "therefore for @xmath38 the range of the potential will increase , which is counterproductive .",
    "this can be avoided by generalizing ( [ eq9 ] ) to complex @xmath33 s .",
    "then @xmath39 which for @xmath40 increases the mass @xmath41 in the exponent to @xmath42 and thus choosing @xmath43 suitably decreases the range of the interaction again . at the same time",
    "also the wave function decreases faster due to the factor @xmath44 in the exponent .",
    "let us call that transformation extended csm ( ecsm ) .",
    "we firstly illustrate the power of the ecsm in the 2n system using the reid  93 nn potential in the state @xmath45 . as we have seen in table  [ table1 ] , an enhancement factor @xmath46 leads to a resonance state with a complex energy eigenvalue @xmath47mev .",
    "if one uses in eq.([eq8 ] ) the first term with @xmath30 only the energy eigenvalue is badly presented ( see tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the result is improved and we can gain the correct result with the required precision using csm with @xmath48 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) . note that in table  [ table2 ] we stick to the asymptotic form ( @xmath30 ) in view of the fact that for 3 bodies we also have only approximate forms .",
    "if we now allow for negative @xmath43 s then as can be seen in table  [ table2 ] we gain the correct eigenvalue even choosing a very small matching radius .",
    "we also see from table  [ table2 ] that csm for increasing @xmath49 gets numerically unstable at a certain value of @xmath49 . in this example",
    "it happens around @xmath50 .",
    "this behavior is intricately connected to the present day parametrizations of nn interactions and puts into question the applicability of csm for finding broad resonances in nuclear systems .",
    "the parametrizations are typically of yukawa type ( one boson exchanges ) like in the reid93  @xcite or reid soft core potential  @xcite . the analytical continuation to complex",
    "r - values leads to an oscillating behavior of the potential , which drastically increase with increasing @xmath49 , with unstable numerics as a consequence .",
    "we examplify this behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the reid93 potential .",
    "we checked several of the existing nn potentials and found always this problem ( potentials according to gogny  @xcite , r.de tourreil and d.w.l .",
    "sprung  @xcite , h. eikemeier and h.h .",
    "hackenbroich  @xcite , and r. de tourreil  @xcite ) . in case of the av14  @xcite and av18  @xcite potentials the situation is even worse due to a singularity for complex r - values in their parametrization of the hard core part .",
    "also gauss - parametrizations are not an exception . in this case",
    "the form @xmath51 limits the complex scaling angle @xmath49 to @xmath52 .",
    "one possibility to generalize the csm in order to avoid the above problems is the so called `` smooth - exterior '' complex scaling ( secs )  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to perform the complex rotation only outside the region of interaction . in this way the analytical continuation of the potential into the complex coordinate plane is avoided . in practice this can be achieved for instance by performing the following transformation ( note the printing errors in  @xcite leading to false expressions ( 2.1.30 ) and ( 2.1.32 ) ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 this transformation leads to the smooth - exterior - scaled hamiltonian @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 the case @xmath58 corresponds to usual csm @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath60 outside the region of the nn interaction and choosing a proper value for @xmath61 a smooth - exterior - scaling path results , which avoids the oscillating changes of the nn potential .",
    "we present in table  [ table3 ] the effectiveness of this approach by aplying it to the @xmath62 resonance state for the reid93 nn potential with @xmath63 .",
    "it is enough to keep only the first term in the boundary condition ( [ eq8 ] ) to reproduce the correct resonance position when a sufficiently large value of the scaling angle @xmath33 is chosen .",
    "now , however , contrary to csm , no numerical problems arise when large values of @xmath33 are used . in spite of its success in the 2n system",
    "we think that the secs can not be easily applied in 3n systems .",
    "we could not overcome problems arising from the permutation operator ( see section iii ) .",
    "now we investigate 3-body resonances as solutions of configuration space faddeev equations .",
    "they are often called kowalski - noyes equations and have the form  @xcite @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the kinetic energy , v the two - body force , @xmath18 a faddeev component and p the sum of two permutation operators such that the total , properly symmetrized wave function is @xmath66 . based on standard jacobi variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 it is convenient to introduce polar coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 . if we express the faddeev component @xmath71 in terms of partial wave amplitudes @xmath72 which specify angular momenta and isospin quantum numbers , then we obtain @xmath73 and eq.([eq16 ] ) turns into a coupled set of partial - integrodifferential equations  @xcite @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the coupling results from the permutation operator p and from possible spin dependencies in v. the evaluation of the permutation operator matrix elements @xmath78 and the resulting expression for the kernel @xmath79 is presented in appendix a.    similarily as in the 2-body case the resonance conditions are such that @xmath80 has to be regular at the origin and purely outgoing in all channels . for the reduced amplitudes @xmath81 this",
    "amounts to  @xcite @xmath82 and for large distances @xmath83 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) occurs only in channels @xmath33 , where a two - body bound state @xmath84 exists .",
    "the second part describes the behavior in the 3-body breakup channel .",
    "the corresponding momenta are @xmath85 where m is the nucleon mass and @xmath86 the two - body binding energy .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq21 ] ) apply also to bound states with real eigenvalues e which are located below all two - body thresholds @xmath86 . for resonances",
    "e is complex and the eigenvalues e close to the real axis of the physical sheet are of interest .",
    "they either lie in second sheets which are accessible to the right of @xmath86-values ( two - body fragmentation cuts ) or in the lower half plane of a second sheet , which is accessible through the 3n - breakup cut to the right of @xmath87 .",
    "for a recent description of the cut - structure see for instance  @xcite .",
    "an efficient method for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) is very well displayed in  @xcite .",
    "one chooses suitable grid points in @xmath88 and @xmath89 and interpolates @xmath90 in terms of cubic splines .",
    "similarily as in the 2-body case the boundary conditions ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) can be conveniently incorporated either by the absence of certain expansion coefficients in the spline expansion or by suitable relations among the coefficients . then choosing appropriate collocation points in @xmath88 and @xmath89 one ends up in a homogeneous algebraic set of equations . for realistic nn forces",
    "the dimension of the matrix is very large and the tensor product method  @xcite is a key - technique .",
    "we use a lanczos type iteration method  @xcite and of course take advantage of the sparceness property of the matrices .",
    "it is advantegeous to work with further reduced amplitudes f defined as @xmath91 , if one treats resonances below the cut with @xmath92 . in appendix",
    "b we present the details of the above procedure .",
    "the main problem in solving eq .  ( [ eq18 ] ) is the approximate nature of the asymptotic form ( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "ab initio it is not known at which @xmath88-value this form is valid with sufficient accuracy .",
    "for a recent discussion see  @xcite . also it is a priori not known how many terms should be included in the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq21 ] ) for a particular 3n resonance state .",
    "one suspects of course that including more terms one approaches more closely the exact boundary condition .",
    "the importance of the terms in eq.([eq21 ] ) going with increasing powers of @xmath93 depends not only on the resonance energy and the matching value for @xmath88 but also on the magnitudes of the a priori unknown functions @xmath94 . for resonances commonly these problems",
    "are expected to be overcome using the complex scaling method ( csm )  @xcite . however , due to the restrictions imposed on this method by the behavior of the nn forces as discussed in section ii we found that this method can be applied in the framework of the configuration space faddeev equations only for rather narrow resonances .",
    "thereby all relative coordinates ( x and y in the 3-body case ) are rotated into the complex plane .",
    "this amounts to @xmath95 where @xmath33 is restricted to rather small values .",
    "an example for realistic nn forces is mentioned at the end of this section . however , if the forces are very simple , csm can work as will be illustrated below .",
    "one is intended to hope that secsm which proved to be very efficient in the 2-body case will help here , too . however , according to our insights up to now this approach leads to problems we could not solve when calculating the permutation operator p and when performing the transition from cartesian to polar relative coordinates .",
    "the only possibility left is to look at solutions of eq.([eq18 ] ) without leaving the real r - axis and taking the boundary condition ( [ eq21 ] ) with a sufficient number of terms into account in order to reach as close as possible the exact boundary condition . in this manner",
    "one can hope to get convergence for the resulting resonance position .",
    "we checked our configuration space code by calculating the energy of the bound state of @xmath7 nuclei with the reid 93 nn potential taking different nn force components into account . in table",
    "[ table3a ] we present our numbers together with results of momentum space faddeev calculations  @xcite .",
    "the very good agreement between both approaches is clearly seen .    in the first step we considered 3 bosons interacting via gaussian s - wave forces @xmath96 . \\label{eq24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they are such that a barrier is built in , which is an obvious and trivial mechanism generating a resonance .",
    "that interaction does not support a two - body bound state and in the asymptotic form ( [ eq21 ] ) the first term is absent . for 3 bosons in the @xmath97 state and interacting by s - wave forces only the kernel @xmath98 .",
    "this model has been used in  @xcite in applying the stochastic variational method .",
    "the resonance energy found there is @xmath99  mev . in this case",
    "csm works .",
    "for instance for a matching radius of @xmath100  fm and taking the a- and b - terms in ( [ eq21 ] ) into account we achieved the results shown in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "for @xmath101 we are close to the result found in  @xcite but not close enough . a smaller matching radius , however , like @xmath102  fm does not work .",
    "the correct result can however be achieved if in addition we turn on @xmath103 .",
    "this is demonstrated in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "we illustrate in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] typical resonance amplitudes f working with real coordinates or with complex coordinates . in both cases",
    "the matching radius has been chosen as @xmath104  fm . in the first case",
    "this is not sufficient to achieve the correct complex energy eigenvalue , whereas in the second case the amplitude is already sufficiently damped at @xmath102  fm and the correct energy eigenvalue is accessible at such a small matching radius .    in this simple case one can study the problem how many terms @xmath105 in the boundary condition ( [ eq21 ] )",
    "should be taken into account to get the correct resonance position .",
    "of course it will depend on the value of the matching radius @xmath88 .",
    "we present in table  [ table5 ] resonance positions obtained with increasing number of terms in the boundary condition ( [ eq21 ] ) and different matching radii .",
    "for the details to include arbitrary number of terms in the asymptotic condition we refer to appendix b. it is seen from table  [ table5 ] that for matching radii @xmath106  fm it is practically sufficient to take only the two leading terms going with a and b into account in order to get the correct resonance position .",
    "we also see that the restriction to the a term alone is totally insufficient .",
    "unfortunately this example is far from reality in nuclear physics .",
    "it does not contain a short range repulsion and the mechanism for creating a resonance in few nucleon systems is different in reality , where it is not caused by a barrier in the potential itself .",
    "now we investigate the case of three interacting neutrons in states with different total angular momenta and parity .",
    "we allowed the nn force to act in the states @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "they are of attractive nature while the repulsive ones were neglected .",
    "this is only a feasibility study and should provide a first orientation .",
    "in the first step the nn forces were chosen as a smooth , local nn force of ref .",
    "@xcite , called in the following gogny potential .",
    "it is a rather simple approach to nn phase - shifts through forces of central , tensor and spin - orbit type supplemented by a @xmath109 term , all of which of gaussian form . to initiate the search process for the position of the resonance energy we artificially enhanced the force components in the three states such that all of them support a two - neutron bound state at the same energy .",
    "an example is shown in table  [ table6 ] for a @xmath110 state of three neutrons .",
    "for these enhancement factors also the 3n system is bound .",
    "then we reduce the enhancement factors ( some intermediate cases are shown in table  [ table6 ] ) , which traces out a bound state trajectory . in this case",
    "we see that the 3n bound state still exists even when all 2n subsystem bound states have disappeared .",
    "then we can neglect the first term in the boundary condition ( [ eq21 ] ) . decreasing further the enhancement factor(s ) ( in this specific case only for @xmath108 ) the energy eigenvalue goes into the second sheet and traces out a resonance trajectory .",
    "the search for the resonance position corresponding to the actual nn force is finished when the enhancement factors in all nn force components have reached the values @xmath111 .",
    "as we shall see in the case of three neutrons we face numerical instabilities before all @xmath112 reach the value 1 .",
    "we can present the resonance trajectory only partially up to the point , where we encounter those instabilities .",
    "we expect that they are probably caused by the difficulty to fulfill the resonance condition , which requires that the exponentially decreasing , purely incoming wave is much smaller than the exponentially increasing purely outgoing wave .",
    "as we see from table  [ table6 ] the @xmath110 3n bound state disappears when the enhancement factors arrive at @xmath113 .",
    "in table  [ table7 ] the trajectory of the @xmath114 3n resonance in the second energy sheet is mapped out by decreasing the enhancement factor @xmath115 in step of 0.05 starting from @xmath116 .",
    "the final reliable position reached is for @xmath117 with the value @xmath118  mev .",
    "as can be seen this stable position is only obtained when at least 4 terms in the boundary condition ( [ eq21 ] ) are taken into account .",
    "we checked that our particular distribution of @xmath88 and @xmath89 points as well as the choice of the matching radius in @xmath88 does not influence the resulting trajectory .",
    "the values given in table  [ table7 ] are based on a matching radius @xmath119  fm and typically @xmath120 and @xmath121 points distributed by scaling factors @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( see ref .",
    "it is unfortunate that right now we are not able to reach the final position with @xmath124 .",
    "however very likely the width will be quite large .",
    "therefore one can not expect to see a visible enhancement around some 3n c.m .",
    "energy in a reaction producing three neutrons in the state @xmath114 .",
    "similarily to @xmath114 behave the @xmath125 and @xmath126 states based on the gogny potential . with proper enhancement factors",
    "@xmath29 the three neutrons are bound together with 2-neutron bound states for @xmath127 , @xmath45 and @xmath108 .",
    "these 3n states remain bound even when the 2-neutron bound states disappear with appropriately reduced enhancement factors .",
    "they disappear into the second energy sheet when the enhancement factors reach @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath130 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "these enhancements factors are of course not unique but we worked with those examples . following their trajectories before numerical instabilities set in results in the complex energy eigenvalues shown for the gogny potential in table  [ table8 ] . for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 states ,",
    "similarily as for @xmath114 , the final , converged position is obtained only when at least 4 terms in the boundary condition are taken into account . in fig.[fig4 ] we show the trajectories for the three states @xmath125 , @xmath114 , and @xmath126 for the gogny potential .",
    "we note that the trajectories are not unique and depend how the enhancement factors are changed .",
    "our startegy was to bring all of them together to one as close as possible .",
    "in this article we did not investigate the state @xmath131 , since we found , like in  @xcite that the 3n bound state disappears earlier than the 2n bound states .",
    "in other words , the 3n bound state trajectory will enter into the 2n - n two - body fragmentation cut .",
    "we left that study with the additional asymptotic term in eq.([eq21 ] ) to a future investigation .",
    "it is seen from table  [ table8 ] that the @xmath126 state for the gogny potential is relatively narrow .",
    "taking the enhancement factors @xmath132 results in a resonance position @xmath133  mev .",
    "for such a narrow resonance the csm works properly for not too large values of the @xmath33 angle ( see table  [ table8a ] ) . increasing it",
    ", however , the resulting energy eigenvalue is totally wrong what can be traced back to the increasing oscillations of the nn potential resulting from its analytical continuation to the complex r - values .    in the last step we checked how the results depend on the nn interaction used .",
    "we choose a modern , realistic nn interaction as given by the reid 93 potential .",
    "the resulting positions of the 3n resonances , as far as we could trace them out , are shown for two examples in table  [ table9 ] . in spite of the fact that the particular values of the @xmath29 s change of course",
    ", the resulting picture is basically the same as for the gogny potential .",
    "we are still too far away from all @xmath134 in order to definitely say that all the widths will be quite large . but this will likely be the case . again to achieve converged results one has to take at least 4 terms in the boundary condition ( [ eq21 ] ) into account .",
    "we investigated the configuration space faddeev equations with the aim to determine the location of 3-neutron resonances .",
    "realistic nn forces have been used . the asymptotic form in the 3n breakup channel",
    "is known only in the sense of an asymptotic expansion .",
    "we found that several terms thereof have to be included in order to get stable and reliable results , which are independent of the matching radius .",
    "the search for the resonance positions was carried through by artificially enhancing 2n force components such that a 3n bound state exists . then by reducing those enhancement factors we followed the paths of the energy eigenvalue into the second sheet adjacent to @xmath135 .",
    "unfortunately it turned out that numerical instabilities set in before we reached the actual strengths factors 1 for all the individually enhanced force components .",
    "therefore we could not reach the very final positions of the studied 3n resonances in the states @xmath136 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the detailed reason for those instabilities remains to be found out . despite of",
    "that our results already indicate that the imaginary parts of the complex resonance energies will be quite large , so that one should not expect to see resonances in experiments .",
    "we also applied the csm , which works beautifully in atomic phyics .",
    "the complex coordinates turn the exponentially increasing resonance wave function into an exponentially decreasing one , like for a bound state , and the problem with the approximate boundary conditions is avoided .",
    "however , for realistic nn interactions the complex scaling transformation @xmath137 increases the interaction range by a factor @xmath138 and leads for scaling angles @xmath33 greater than about @xmath50 to a strong oscillations of the potential .",
    "this restricts the application of the complex scaling method in more than 2-nucleon systems to rather narrow resonances . in the 2-nucleon system",
    "one can avoid the above restriction by performing the complex rotation outside the region of non - zero interaction .",
    "due to the neccessary particle permutation in the 3-body system we were not able to use that idea in the 3-body context .",
    "this project deserves further investigations to locate all lowest resonances in the three nucleon systems based on modern nn and possibly three - nucleon forces .",
