    "the definition of extremal elements in characteristic @xmath2 is more involved , which is one reason for restricting ourselves to characteristics unequal to @xmath2 here .",
    "extremal elements and sandwich elements play important roles in both classical and modern lie algebra theory . in complex simple lie algebras , or their split analogues over other fields , extremal elements are precisely the elements that are long - root vectors relative to some maximal torus .",
    "sandwich elements are used in the classification of simple lie algebras in small characteristics @xcite ; they occur in the modular lie algebras of cartan type , such as the witt algebras .",
    "sandwich elements were originally introduced in relation with the restricted burnside problem @xcite . an important insight for the resolution of this problem is the fact that a lie algebra generated by finitely many sandwich elements is necessarily finite - dimensional .",
    "while this fact was first only proved under extra assumptions , in @xcite it is proved in full generality .",
    "we will use this result in what follows .",
    "the prominence of extremal elements in the work of kostrikin and zelmanov and in modular lie algebra theory led to the natural problem of describing all lie algebras generated by a fixed number of extremal elements @xcite .",
    "example suppose that we want to describe all lie algebras @xmath4 generated by two extremal elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 . since @xmath10 $ ] is a scalar multiple @xmath11 of @xmath8 and @xmath12=-[y,[y , x]]$ ] is a scalar multiple @xmath13 of @xmath9 , @xmath14 is spanned by @xmath15 $ ]",
    ". there may be linear dependencies between these elements , but let us assume that they are linearly independent .",
    "then @xmath16=[y,[x,[x , y]]]=[[y , x],[x , y]]+[x,[y,[x , y]]]=0-b[x , y]=b[y , x],\\ ] ] and since we have assumed that @xmath17 \\neq 0 $ ] , we find that @xmath18 .",
    "hence three - dimensional lie algebras with a distinguished pair of extremal generators are parameterised by the single number @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , all algebras with @xmath20 are mutually isomorphic and isomorphic to the split simple lie algebra of type @xmath21 , while the algebra with @xmath22 is nilpotent and isomorphic to the three - dimensional heisenberg algebra .",
    "this is a prototypical example of our results .",
    "the next smallest case of three generators is treated in @xcite and also by our results below . there",
    "the generic lie algebra is split of type @xmath23 and more interesting degenerations exist .",
    "we now generalise and formalise this example to the case of more generators , where we also allow for the flexibility of prescribing that certain generators commute .",
    "thus let @xmath0 be a finite simple graph without loops or multiple edges .",
    "let @xmath24 be the vertex set of @xmath0 and denote the neighbour relation by @xmath25 .",
    "fixing a field @xmath1 of characteristic unequal to @xmath2 , we denote by @xmath26 the quotient of the free lie algebra over @xmath1 generated by @xmath24 modulo the relations @xmath27=0 \\text { for all } x , y \\in \\pi",
    "\\text { with } x\\not \\sim y.\\ ] ] so @xmath26 depends both on @xmath0 and on @xmath1 , but we will not make this dependence explicit in the notation .",
    "we write @xmath28 for the space of all @xmath1-linear functions @xmath29 . for every @xmath30 , also written @xmath31 , we denote by @xmath32 the quotient of @xmath26 by the ideal @xmath33 generated by the ( infinitely many ) elements @xmath34-f_x(y)x,\\   x \\in \\pi , y \\in { \\mathcal{f}}.\\ ] ] by construction @xmath32 is a lie algebra generated by extremal elements , corresponding to the vertices of @xmath0 , which commute when they are not connected in @xmath0 .",
    "the element @xmath35 is a parameter needed to express the extremality of @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath0 is not connected , then both @xmath26 and @xmath32 naturally split into direct sums over all connected components of @xmath0 , so it is no restriction to assume that @xmath0 is connected ; we will do so throughout this paper .    in the lie algebra @xmath37 the elements of @xmath24 map to sandwich elements ,",
    "hence by @xcite this lie algebra is finite - dimensional . for general @xmath30",
    "it turns out that @xmath38 ; see @xcite or the proof of theorem [ thm : variety ] below .",
    "it is therefore natural to focus on the lie algebras @xmath32 of the maximal possible dimension @xmath39 .",
    "this leads us to define the set @xmath40 the parameter space for all maximal - dimensional lie algebras of the form @xmath32 .",
    "example in the two - generator case above @xmath0 is the graph with two vertices joined by an edge .",
    "the sandwich algebra @xmath37 is the three - dimensional heisenberg algebra , and the condition that @xmath41 corresponds to our assumption above that @xmath15 $ ] be linearly independent .",

    "our first main result is that @xmath3 carries a natural structure of an affine algebraic variety . to specify this structure we note that @xmath43 is a homogeneous ideal relative to the natural @xmath44-grading that @xmath26 inherits from the free lie algebra generated by @xmath24 .",

    "for all @xmath36 , let @xmath496 be a monomial that spans the weight space in @xmath37 of weight @xmath497 ; this space is @xmath68-dimensional by theorem [ thm : affine ] .",

    "the theorem follows once we can realise generic parameter values in @xmath467 with extremal elements that generate @xmath280 . to this end , choose a generic tuple @xmath491 in @xmath421 . by lemma [ lm : genericaffine ]",
    "these generate @xmath280 and they clearly satisfy @xmath512 for @xmath513 . hence they yield a point in @xmath3 with @xmath514 for @xmath429 . furthermore , the parameter @xmath499 equals the extremal form evaluated on @xmath515 and the monomial @xmath508 evaluated in the @xmath426 .",
    "express that monomial in the @xmath426 as @xmath516 plus a term perpendicular to @xmath517 , and write @xmath515 as @xmath518 .",
    "for the degenerate case where @xmath519 for all @xmath8 we have @xmath520 and @xmath521 ( that monomial is a non - zero scalar multiple of the highest root vector , @xmath522 ) , so that @xmath523 .",
    "therefore , this parameter is non - zero generically .",
    "hence we have found a point @xmath524 . along the lines of remark [ re : rank ] we now distinguish three cases :    1 .   if the @xmath525 and @xmath303 are linearly independent , then @xmath368 acts transitively on @xmath477 , and we are done .",
    "if the @xmath525 are linearly independent , but @xmath303 lies in their span , then we now show that we can alter the point @xmath50 above in a direction transversal to its @xmath368-orbit .",
    "let @xmath526 be the torus in the adjoint group of @xmath280 whose lie algebra is @xmath385 , and consider the effect on @xmath50 of conjugation of @xmath515 with an element @xmath527 , while keeping the other @xmath426 fixed .",
    "this transforms @xmath528 in @xmath529 , and therefore it transforms @xmath499 into @xmath530 while it keeps the parameters @xmath531 with @xmath532 unchanged : these only depend on @xmath533 .",
    "this shows that we can indeed move @xmath50 inside @xmath3 in a direction transversal to its @xmath368-orbit , and we are done .",
    "+ [ it : conjugate ] 3 .",
    "finally , in the case of @xmath534 with @xmath480 even we first show that tuples in @xmath421 only give points in a proper closed subset of @xmath467 . here",
    "@xmath535 and @xmath0 is an @xmath480-cycle ; label its points @xmath536 .",
    "relative to the usual choices of @xmath537 the element @xmath538 is a matrix with @xmath539-block @xmath540 on the diagonal in rows ( and columns ) @xmath167 and @xmath541 and zeroes elsewhere .",
    "we count the rows and columns modulo @xmath480 so that row @xmath49 is actually row @xmath480 .",
    "but then we have @xmath542 , and this implies @xmath543 so the tuple of parameter values of the tuple @xmath544 lies in a proper closed subset @xmath545 of @xmath467 .",
    "+ we therefore allow the tuple @xmath546 to vary in a slightly larger variety @xmath547 as follows : the conditions on @xmath548 remain the same , but @xmath549 is now allowed to take the shape @xmath550 ( which is extremal since it has rank @xmath68 and trace @xmath49 ) , subject to the equations @xmath551 which ensure that @xmath549 commutes with @xmath552",
    ". still , any tuple in an open neighbourhood @xmath553 of our original tuple @xmath546 ( with generic @xmath554 and @xmath555 but all @xmath556 equal to @xmath49 ) generates @xmath557 .",
    "we now argue that the differential @xmath59 at @xmath546 of the map @xmath558 sending a tuple to the parameters that it realises has rank @xmath53 , as required .",
    "indeed , the @xmath368-action already gives a subspace of dimension @xmath559 , tangent to @xmath545 .",
    "making @xmath560 ( and hence all @xmath556 ) non - zero adds @xmath561 to @xmath562 and @xmath563 to @xmath564 , and it fixes all other @xmath565 .",
    "we show that this infinitesimal direction is not tangent to @xmath545 : it adds @xmath566 to the left - hand side of , and @xmath567 to the right - hand side . dividing these expressions by common factors ,",
    "the first becomes @xmath568 and the second @xmath569 .",
    "these expressions are not equal generically , even modulo the equations relating the @xmath556 to the @xmath554 and @xmath555 ; indeed , these equations do not involve @xmath570 .",
    "+ note that varying @xmath560 may also effect the parameter @xmath499 , but in any case the above shows that the composition of the differential @xmath59 with projection onto @xmath442 is surjective . on the other hand , conjugation with the torus @xmath526 as in case yields a vector in the image of @xmath59 which is supported only on the factor @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath303 .",
    "this concludes the proof that @xmath59 has full rank .",
    "going through the proof that @xmath3 is an affine variety , one observes that the map @xmath571 is not only injective on @xmath3 , but even on @xmath572 the same is true for the map @xmath573 in the case where @xmath0 is a dynkin diagram of finite type , and for the map @xmath574 in the case where @xmath0 is a dynkin diagram of affine type .",
    "this shows that , for these dynkin diagrams , @xmath575 is actually _ equal _ to @xmath3 , whence the following theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a dynkin diagram of finite or affine type .",
    "let @xmath14 be any lie algebra , over a field of characteristic unequal to @xmath2 , which is generated by non - zero extremal elements @xmath576 , in which the commutation relations @xmath512 for @xmath456 hold .",
    "define @xmath577 by the condition that @xmath578 holds in @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath74 and @xmath14 is a quotient of @xmath32 .",
    "this theorem could well prove useful for recognising the chevalley algebras @xmath280 : if @xmath50 corresponds to a point in the open dense subset of @xmath467 referred to in theorem [ thm : genericaffine ] , then one concludes that @xmath14 is a quotient of @xmath280 . hence if @xmath280 is a simple lie algebra , then @xmath14 is isomorphic to @xmath280 .",
    "it is not clear to us whether , for general @xmath0 , the image of @xmath575 in @xmath48 is closed ; this is why we chose to work with @xmath3 instead .",
    "our methods work very well for dynkin diagrams , but for more general graphs new ideas are needed to determine @xmath579 and @xmath32 for @xmath74 .",
    "the relation with the kac - moody algebra of @xmath0 may be much tighter than we proved in subsection [ ssec : kacmoody ] .",
    "general questions of interest are : is @xmath3 always an affine space ?",
    "is there always a generic lie algebra ?",
    "we expect the answers to both questions to be negative , but do not have any counterexamples .",
    "the references @xcite contain other series of graphs which exhibit the same properties as we have proved here : the variety @xmath3 is an affine space , and generic points in it correspond to simple lie algebras of types @xmath580 .",
    "in fact , the graph that they find for @xmath581 is just the finite - type dynkin diagram of type @xmath582 .",
    "this also follows easily from our results : take @xmath583 generic extremal elements @xmath584 in @xmath585 as in lemma [ lm : genericfinite ] .",
    "these generate a subalgebra of @xmath585 of dimension @xmath586 by that same lemma , and if we consider them as matrices , their images span a subspace @xmath262 of dimension @xmath583 in @xmath587 .",
    "it is not hard to write down an explicit , non - degenerate skew symmetric form on @xmath262 with respect to which the @xmath426 are skew  hence the lie algebra generated by them is @xmath588 .",
