    "the cloverleaf is the gravitationally lensed image of the quasar h1413 + 117 ( 14@xmath6 15@xmath7 46@xmath8.23 ; @xmath9 j2000.0 ) at @xmath10 showing four spots with angular separations from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . since its discovery ( magain et al .",
    "1988 ) , the cloverleaf has been observed spectroscopically and imaged with ground based telescopes in various bands from b to i as well as at 3.6 cm with the vla .",
    "an early model of the gravitational lens was derived by kayser et al ( 1990 ) .",
    "the main difficulty with this model lies in the fact that it predicts , for a z=1.44 lens , a mass of @xmath3 2.5 @xmath13 @xmath14 m@xmath5 within @xmath15 ( 6 @xmath14 kpc ) radius , which would correspond to a relatively bright normal galaxy : so far , searches in the k band of the predicted ` bright ' lensing galaxy have been unsuccessful ( lawrence 1996 ) and this fact remains a mystery .",
    "+ new data sets are available : the post - costar hst / wfpc2 uv images ( partly discussed in turnshek et al .",
    "1997 ) , maps and spectral informations in the molecular co transitions ( barvainis et al 1994 , wilner et al 1995 , barvainis et al 1997 , yun et al 1997 , alloin et al 1997 ) and ccd images of the cloverleaf over a 5 field of view ( cfht / focam archive ) allowing a precise astrometry of the field obtained through different wavebands .",
    "new results obtained from these data are discussed in the following sections . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use h@xmath16= 50 @xmath17 km / s / mpc , @xmath18=1 and @xmath19 .",
    "our previous co(7 - 6 ) iram interferometer measurements ( alloin et al 1997 ) have been complemented with observations at intermediate baselines .",
    "the combined data lead to the cleaned integrated map restored with a @xmath20 circular beam shown in figure  [ fig : iram]a . in order to search for a velocity gradient",
    ", we have first derived the spatially integrated line profile , following the procedure discussed in alloin et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the new co(7 - 6 ) line profile , shown in figure 2 of kneib et al ( 1998 ) , exhibits a marked asymmetry with a steep rise on its blue side and a slower decrease on its red side .",
    "excluding the central velocity channel ( so that the split in velocity is symmetric ) , we have built the blue ( -225,-25 km / s ) and the red ( + 25,+225 km / s ) maps displayed in figures  [ fig : iram]c and [ fig : iram]d respectively .",
    "the difference between the red - shifted and blue - shifted cleaned maps ( figure  [ fig : iram]b ) establishes definitely the presence of a velocity gradient at the 8@xmath2 level",
    ". + measurements of the spot characteristics from the co(7 - 6 ) image have been performed ( spot flux ratios , sizes and orientations ) through a fitting procedure in the visibility domain , as explained in alloin et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the final parameters are provided in table 1 of kneib et al ( 1998 ) where the spot sizes are intrinsic to the image , _",
    "i.e. _ deconvolved by the interferometer beam .",
    "although the measurements have not been corrected for seeing effects ( mean seeing estimate of the order of @xmath21 ) the spots a , b and c appear to be definitely elongated ( see figure  [ fig : iram]b for spot labels ) .",
    "the hst data of the cloverleaf have been provided by the eso / st - ecf science archive facility ( garching ) .",
    "two data sets obtained with the wfpc2 are used here , obtained by turnshek in 1994 and by westphal in 1995 .",
    "standard reduction procedures using iraf / stsdas packages have been applied .",
    "the absolute photometry was obtained using magnitude zero - points given in holtzmann et al .",
    "complete information about the final images can be found in kneib et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "+ regarding the relative astrometry and spot sizes , the pc observations in filters f336w , f555w , f702w and f814w provide similar results ( see table 1 in kneib et al 1998 ) .",
    "the four spots are stellar - like with a fwhm @xmath22 1.5 pixel or @xmath23 . + the absolute photometry and the relative intensity ratios ( table 4 in kneib et al 1998 ) have been computed with the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "no psf fitting was applied as the four different spots are well separated on the pc . the important variation of the intensity ratios in u compared to v , r and i band could probably be explained by absorption along the line of sight by intervening galaxies ( hi clouds at redshift @xmath24 will act as very efficient absorbers in the u band ) .",
    "turnshek et al ( 1997 ) proposed that dust extinction is the explanation with a preference for an smc - like dust extinction at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "figure  [ fig : mosaici ] shows the deep f814w image , where the presence of numerous faint objects over a @xmath25 region in the environment of the cloverleaf is striking . in order to quantify this effect",
    "we have computed the object number density , @xmath26n@xmath27 , and its dispersion , @xmath28 , in the magnitude range i=23 to 25 .",
    "we have estimated this density in different regions across the   diameter region around the cloverleaf where the density contrast is clearly visible by eye and in various randomly selected areas of similar size .",
    "on the whole frame we find a mean value @xmath26n@xmath29 objects / arcmin@xmath30 ( 1 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the region around the cloverleaf has @xmath26n@xmath31 objects / arcmin@xmath30 , with a peak at 130 objects / arcmin@xmath30 .",
    "the bulk of the objects forming the overdensity are red objects with @xmath32 ( from 0.7 to 1.2 ) and have a small size ( @xmath33 ) . while their morphology can not be obtained from the hst images , their red color suggest that we might be dealing with e / s0 galaxies in a high - redshift cluster .",
    "this cluster could either be linked to the quasar at redshift z@xmath32.56 or along the line of sight .",
    "hereafter , we _ assume _ this cluster to be at a redshift close to that of the narrow absorption systems observed by turnshek et al ( 1988 ) , and magain et al ( 1988 ) : either 1.438 , 1.661 , 1.87 or 2.07 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we shall adopt hereafter a value of 1.7 .",
    "+ although the cluster candidate mentioned earlier is acting as an additional lensing agent , the small angular separation between the four spots implies that part of the lensing effect is produced by a galaxy located amid the four spots of the quasar .",
    "the detection of the lensing galaxy would be of great importance to model accurately the mass distribution of the lens . yet , its presence is still elusive ( angonin et al .",
    "1990 ; lawrence 1996 ) .",
    "we tentatively used the deepest wfpc2/f814w image in order to detect it .",
    "the four spots of the quasar have been subtracted using the psf model provided by a nearby star .",
    "we conclude that the lensing galaxy must have @xmath34 . from modelling considerations ( bruzual & charlot 1993 )",
    ", we find that the galaxy should have an absolute magnitude larger than @xmath35 in order not to be detected .",
    "hence , neither the visible nor the near infrared data are sufficient to constrain the mass of the lensing galaxy .",
    "but if we include the likely presence of the distant cluster , it is no longer necessary to invoke a large mass for the lensing galaxy since a fraction of the convergence and the deflection angle would be contributed by the cluster .",
    "in order to derive precisely the shear induced by the gravitational lens on an extended source in the quasar , it is imperative to register with a high accuracy the cloverleaf image in a waveband corresponding to point - like images of the quasar ( i.e. r - band corresponding to rest wavelength 1967  ) and in a waveband corresponding to an extended source in the quasar ( i.e. the co(7 - 6 ) molecular emission ) .",
    "the high precision required , better than @xmath21 , can not be achieved from the hst data because of their limited field of view .",
    "hence , we used a set of r and i bands for wide - field exposures of the cloverleaf field obtained under 0.6 `` seeing conditions at cfht by angonin , vanderriest and chatzichristou , with focam .",
    "the absolute astrometry was performed using 6 reference stars across the field , from the cambridge apm database .",
    "this allows absolute positioning of the brightest spot a within an accuracy of @xmath36 ( rms ) .",
    "then , we have used the relative astrometry of spots b , c and d , with respect to a , from the hst image ( relative accuracy @xmath37 ) .",
    "finally , the iram co(7 - 6 ) image is obtained within an absolute astrometric accuracy of @xmath38 ( rms ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to register both the optical and the millimeter data in an absolute manner ( figure  [ fig : iram ] ) , and within an accuracy of 0.15 '' .",
    "the modelling of the cloverleaf lens is based on the minimization algorithm described previously in several papers ( kneib et al 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "the model incorporates parameters of the lensing potential through a simple analytical representation of the mass distribution , here a truncated elliptical mass distribution ( kneib et al 1998 ) .",
    "the constraints used for the gravitational lens modelling are as follows :    1 .",
    "the _ relative positions _ of the four quasar spots from the hst and the _ intensity ratio _ taken in the r and i band , the least affected by dust absorption .",
    "the _ non - detection _ of a 5th spot , which puts a limit on the size of the lens core .",
    "the _ position of the cluster center _ as measured from the overdensity of galaxies near the cloverleaf .",
    "4 .   both the cluster and the lensing galaxy are assumed to be at z=1.7 .",
    "the _ relative intensity ratios and the measured shapes of the co spots _ are used as a test of the model , and provide in addition information on the size and geometry of the co source in the quasar .",
    "we have computed two types of model : model 1 which includes an individual galaxy with a dark halo at z=1.7 and model 2 which considers an individual galaxy and a cluster both at z=1.7 .",
    "these models are not unique but give similar qualitative results . the parameters for the lensing galaxy and the cluster component , as well as the full details of the modelling can by found in kneib et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "+ in order to test , at first order , the lens model with the co(7 - 6 ) map , we have assumed the co source to be elliptical with a gaussian profile .",
    "we have fitted its position , size and ellipticity so that it reproduces the observed co image .",
    "the upper limit of its size is provided by the co elongated spots a and b which are close to merging , but still clearly separable .",
    "thus , the model must predict , in the image plane , disconnected isocontours of the a and b spots .",
    "we found a typical size of 460@xmath39230 pc ( fwhm ) for model 1 , and 155@xmath39110 pc ( fwhm ) for model 2 . in the present case",
    ", @xmath40 in the source plane translates into @xmath41 kpc with the chosen cosmology .",
    "a summary of the co modelling is displayed in figure  [ fig : modelco ] .",
    "+ the agreement between the expected amplifications and the observed uv flux ratios is relatively good .",
    "the comparison between the expected amplification and the observed ones in co is not easy . indeed ,",
    "differential amplification due to the co source extent and location with respect to the diamond caustic can explain the observed differences .",
    "the total amplification of the co emission is @xmath3 18 for model 1 and @xmath3 30 for model 2 .",
    "following barvainis et al ( 1997 ) , these amplification factors translate for model 1 ( resp . model 2 ) to molecular mass @xmath42= 3 .",
    "10@xmath43 m@xmath5 ( resp",
    ". 2.10@xmath43 m@xmath5 ) and @xmath44= 3 .",
    "10@xmath43 m@xmath5 ( resp .",
    "2.10@xmath43 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "these mass estimates are in good agreement with the dynamical mass computed in the next section , provided uncertainties in the inclination and in the conversion from @xmath45 to @xmath42 .",
    "in addition to the size of the quasar co source , 150460 pc fwhm , as derived above , we can obtain some information on its substructure using the velocity gradient observed in the co(7 - 6 ) line .",
    "the map corresponding to the blue side of the line ( -225,-25 km / s ) shown in figure  [ fig : iram]c shows that spot c is stronger and slightly displaced inwards with respect to its counterpart in the map corresponding to the red part of the line ( + 25,+225 km / s ) , shown in figure  [ fig : iram]d .",
    "a hint of this effect can be found in yun et al ( 1997 ) although a close comparison of the iram results with the ovro one is hampered by the fact that in the ovro study the spatial resolution is twice lower , the line profile is not shown , the velocity interval considered  145 km / s  is narrower than ours ",
    "200km / s  and not positioned precisely with respect to the line center . using the two lens models obtained previously , we optimized the structure of the co source to reproduce separately the red and the blue images ( figure  [ fig : modelco ] ) .",
    "+ for model 1 [ resp .",
    "model 2 ] , we find a difference of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 pc ) [ resp .",
    "@xmath48 ( @xmath49 pc ) ] between the center of regions emitting the blue and red parts of the co line .",
    "we have tested this procedure against uncertainties in the co / hst images registration .",
    "a change by @xmath50 ( half a co map pixel ) has a very minor impact on the positions of the source regions emitting the blue and red parts of the line .",
    "the quasar point - like visible source appears to be almost exactly centered between the blue- and red - emitting regions .",
    "this is reminiscent of a disk- or ring - like structure orbiting the quasar at a radius of @xmath3 100 pc [ resp .",
    "75 pc ] and with a keplerian velocity of @xmath3 100 km / s ( assuming a 90 deg inclination with respect to the plane of the sky ) , the resulting central mass would be @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 [ resp . @xmath3 7.5 10@xmath51 m@xmath5 ] . elaborating a more sophisticated ( realistic ) model of the co source and its link with",
    "the bal feature also observed in this quasar should be performed in the future .",
    "yet , such a geometry is consistent with the molecular torus of the standard agn model .",
    "the resulting differential amplification is likely at the origin of the asymmetry observed in the line profile ( figure 2 in kneib et al 1998 ) .",
    "this new analysis of the cloverleaf reveals that this is probably a complex lens which includes a lensing galaxy and an additional distant lensing cluster of galaxies .",
    "the reality of the cluster toward the cloverleaf has still to be confirmed independently . yet ,",
    "most of the faint galaxies around the cloverleaf are found in the same magnitude and size ranges , as expected if they indeed belonged to a cluster .",
    "if the cluster is at a very large distance , the shift of its galaxy luminosity function up to higher apparent magnitude would explain why the number - density contrast of the cluster with respect to faint field galaxies is lowered down to only a 4 @xmath2 level .",
    "+ this interpetation implies that the lensing galaxy may not be very massive and consequently may not be very luminous , helping to explain the mystery of the lensing galaxy not having been detected so far .",
    "the drawback is that , despite the constraint that the shapes of the co spots provide on the orientation of the mass density distribution , it mandates sharing the mass between the lensing - galaxy and the lensing - cluster which increases the number of possible lens configurations .",
    "further data might reveal the position and the shape of the light distribution of the lensing galaxy .",
    "+ such information would be useful to improve the mapping of the co source , as emphasized by alloin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . with the present - day data ,",
    "the co source is found to be a disk- or ring - like structure with typical radius of @xmath3 100 pc , under the lens composite model of a galaxy and a cluster at z=1.7 , leading to a central @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 object , typical of a massive black - hole .",
    "it is amazing to see that a disk with such a small intrinsic size can be spatially  resolved \" even at an angular distance as large as 1.6 @xmath14 gpc .",
    "+ although this remains to be confirmed independently , the discovery of a distant cluster of galaxies on the line of sight to the cloverleaf is remarkable because it reinforces the suspicion that many bright high redshift quasars are magnified by cluster - like systems at large distances .",
    "this was already reported from analyses in the fields of the doubly imaged quasar q2345 + 007 ( bonnet et al 1993 ; mellier et al 1994 ; van waerbeke et al 1997 ) , where a cluster candidate is expected to be at z@xmath3 0.75 ( pell et al 1996 ) and of mg2016 where the x - ray emission of the intra - cluster gas has been observed and for which the iron line ( from x - ray spectroscopy ) gives a redshift z@xmath31 ( hattori et al 1997 ) .",
