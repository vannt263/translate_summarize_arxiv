    "core - collapse supernovae result from the violent death of massive stars with initial masses greater than 8 m@xmath7 .",
    "considerable diversity is observed in the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these objects , leading to their classification into various classes .",
    "the core collapse supernovae that show the presence of strong hydrogen lines in their spectra close to maximum light are designated as type ii .",
    "the hydrogen deficient core collapse supernovae are designated type ib or type ic based on the presence , or absence of helium lines , respectively , at light maximum .",
    "a further subclassification of type ii supernovae into type iip ( long plateau in the light curve ) and type iil ( linear decline after peak brightness ) is done based on their light curves",
    ". however , there are some transitional events e.g. sn 1987k @xcite , sn 1993j ( @xcite , @xcite ) , sn 2008ax ( @xcite , @xcite ) , whose spectra at the early phase are dominated by h lines , very similar to the type ii supernovae , but in the later phases , their spectra are dominated by he lines , similar to the type ib events .",
    "because of their simliarity with type ii supernovae in the early phase and later exhibiting properties of type ib supernovae , these transitional objects are classified as type iib supernovae @xcite .",
    "the number of supernovae identifed as iib events is limited , although recently these objects gained greater interest as they provide a link between the hydrogen rich type ii ( type iip and type iil ) supernovae and the hydrogen deficient type ib and ic objects .",
    "the type ib , ic and iib supernovae are collectively known as stripped envelope core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "there is a growing consensus that the observed diversity in the properties of core - collapse supernovae is due to the state of the progenitor star s hydrogen and helium envelopes at the time of explosion ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the subclassification of core - collapse supernovae can be represented in the form of a sequence - iip@xmath11iil@xmath11iib@xmath11ib@xmath11ic , and can possibly be interpreted as a sequence of stripping of the h envelope .",
    "the progenitors of type iip supernovae retain most of the h envelope , while the progenitor stars that lose almost all of the h envelope and retain only a very thin layer of h at the time of explosion produce the type iib events .",
    "the progenitors that have lost their entire hydrogen envelope produce the type ib and those that have been stripped off hydrogen and most of their helium result in type ic supernovae .",
    "in fact , detailed modeling of type iib supernovae have shown that their observed light curves can be reproduced well using helium stars with a very thin hydrogen envelope @xcite .    in a few cases , progenitors of nearby core - collapse supernovae",
    "have been identified in the high resolution , pre - explosion images obtained by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and other large facilities .",
    "the detected progenitors of type iip supernovae indicate that they come from red supergiants ( e.g.   @xcite and references therein ) . for the type iib supernovae ,",
    "the situation is not very clear .",
    "massive stars in close binary systems experiencing strong mass transfer @xcite , or very massive single stars with strong stellar winds @xcite are considered as potential progenitors of type iib events .",
    "the progenitor system of sn 1993j was identified as a k0ia star @xcite in a binary system , with an early b - supergiant companion @xcite .",
    "similarly , an interacting binary system , with a slightly later companion star ( late b through late f ) , was suggested as the progenitor of sn 2001ig @xcite .",
    "a source , coinciding with the position of sn 2008ax was identified in pre - explosion hst images ( @xcite , @xcite ) . however , its interpretation as the progenitor is ambiguous .",
    "@xcite have explored the possibility of ( i ) the progenitor being a single massive star that lost most of its hydrogen envelope through radiatively driven mass loss processes , before exploding as a helium - rich wolf -rayet star , or ( ii ) a stripped star in an interacting binary in a low mass cluster .",
    "the [ caii]/[oi ] ratio in nebular spectra of sn 2008ax , however , is more consistent with the low mass binary scenario @xcite .",
    "a new supernova was discovered by a. riou on 2011 june 1.893 in the nearby galaxy m51 @xcite .",
    "images of the galaxy obtained on may 31.893 also showed the supernova , but , no object was visible at the position of the supernova in the images of may 30 .",
    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) independently discovered the supernova on 2011 june 1.19 @xcite , while the ptf observations of may 31.275 do not show the supernova .",
    "these observations reduce the uncertainty on the date of explosion to better than 0.6 days @xcite .",
    "based on the earliest spectrum of 2011 june 3 , the supernova was classified as a young type ii supernova ( @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "noticed the similarity between the spectrum of sn 2011dh and the type iib events sn 1993j and sn 2008ax , and suggested sn 2011dh was possibly a type iib event .",
    "further observations on june 12 and 16 by @xcite in the infra - red showed the presence of hei features consistent with its classification as a type iib event .",
    "sn 2011dh has been followed extensively in a wide wavelength range , from the radio to the x - rays .",

    "@xcite have presented the optical photometric and spectroscopic data of sn 2011dh during the first 50 days after explosion , while photometric data covering the first @xmath6 300 days after explosion , with a preliminary light curve modelling , have been presented by @xcite .",
    "the reddening in the milky way in the direction of m51 is @xmath12 mag @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of sn 2011dh did not show any narrow lines due to interstellar medium in the host galaxy , except the naid doublet due to the interstellar medium in the milky way ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , indicating low extinction within the host galaxy .",
    "hence , @xmath13 mag is adopted as total reddening .",
    "a search for the progenitor star in the archival pre - explosion hst images obtained with the advanced camera for survey led to the detection of a luminous star at the position of the supernova ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but its nature and association with the supernova remains controversial .",
    "the sed of this candidate progenitor star was found to be consistent with an f8 supergiant , but with a higher luminosity and a more extended radius than a normal supergiant ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite estimate the initial mass of this proposed progenitor to be @xmath14 m@xmath7 . the observed early optical , radio and x - ray observations of sn 2011dh ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the re - analyses of the hst images with an improved distance to m51 @xcite all point toward a compact progenitor , while hydrodynamical modelling suggests that a large progenitor star with radius @xmath6 200 @xmath15 is required to reproduce the early light curve @xcite .",
    "the association of the yellow supergiant with sn 2011dh needs further exploration .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of the existence of such a star in a close binary system by performing binary stellar evolution calculations and arrived at the conclusion that a close binary system of solar composition stars with masses of 16 m@xmath16 m@xmath7 could lead to the evolution of the donor star into a yellow supergiant consistent with the candidate progenitor detected in the hst images .",

    "have calculated nucleosynthesis yields of core - collapse supernovae and hypernovae models for 13 - 40 m@xmath7 progenitor stars for various explosion energies and progenitor metallicity . for core - collapse supernovae of a progenitor mass 13 m@xmath51 , with the explosion energy of @xmath103 ergs and metallicity z = 0 , 0.001 , 0.004 and 0.02 ,",
    "the mass of oxygen ejected in the explosion is 0.45 , 0.50 , 0.39 and 0.22 m@xmath51 , respectively . for similar explosion energy and metallicity range ,",
    "the mass of oxygen for a progenitor star of 15 m@xmath51 is 0.77 , 0.29 , 0.29 and 0.16 m@xmath51 .",
    "the abundance analysis of hii regions in m51 by @xcite has revealed that the o / h abundance is below the solar value for most of the hii regions studied .",
    "hii regions # 53 , # 54 and # 55 of @xcite are close to the location where sn 2011dh occurred .",
    "the measured 12 + log(o / h ) values for these regions varies between 8.49 to 8.66 ( considering the solar value as 8.69 ) .",
    "it shows that the metallicity of the nearby hii regions is close to few tenths of that of solar . assuming that the metallicity at the supernova location is similar to the nearby hii regions , the mass of the ejected oxygen estimated using the oxygen flux in the late time spectra , indicates the progenitor of sn 2011dh to be a low - mass star of @xmath6 13 - 15 m@xmath51 .",
    "the progenitor of a type iib supernova can be either a single massive star that had gone to wolf - rayet phase after losing most of its hydrogen rich envelope before explosion , or it can be a less massive star in a binary system , being stripped off its hydrogen envelope during interaction with the binary component . the inferred lower mass of the progenitor suggests that the progenitor of sn 2011dh was likely a member of a binary system like the progenitor of sn 1993j ( @xcite , @xcite ) and sn 2008ax ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have theoretically calculated the ratio of flux of [ caii ] 7291 - 7324/[oi ] 6300 - 6364 and shown that it weakly depends on the density and temperature of the emitting region , and is expected to remain relatively constant at late epoch .",
    "the flux ratio [ caii ] 7291 - 7324/[oi ] 6300 - 6364 also serves as a good diagnostic of main sequence mass of the progenitor star , as mass of oxygen ejected in the explosion depends on the progenitor mass and mass of ca synthesized during the explosion is not sensitive to the main sequence mass of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "hence , a small value of the flux ratio is expected for massive progenitors . @xcite",
    "have investigated the evolution of observed [ caii]7291 - 7324/[oi]6300 - 6364 for some core collapse supernovae during sufficiently late phases and shown that it remains fairly stable .",
    "the smaller value of [ caii]/[oi ] ratio for type ib / c supernova was explained as due to the absence of hydrogen rich caii emitting region in them . for sn 2011dh , the [ caii]7291 - 7324/[oi]6300 - 6364 flux ratio at @xmath6 340 and @xmath6 360 days after explosion is found to @xmath6 0.7 , indicating that the progenitor star of sn 2011dh was a low mass star . the flux ratio for sn 1993j , sn 2008ax and sn 2007y at similar epochs is @xmath6 0.5 , 0.9 and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "@xcite have computed hydrodynamical models based on evolutionary progenitors and shown that the early light curve of sn 2011dh can be reproduced with a large progenitor star with radius @xmath6 200 r@xmath51 . in their modelling , based on the bolometric light curve and measured photospheric expansion velocity , mass of the ejecta , explosion energy and mass of @xmath8ni was constrained to be @xmath6 2 m@xmath51 , @xmath104 erg and 0.06 m@xmath51 , respectively .",
    "an explosion of a progenitor star with a he core of 3 to 4 m@xmath51 and a thin hydrogen rich envelope of @xmath6 0.1 m@xmath51 can lead to sn 2011dh like event .",
    "the progenitor star appears to be in a binary system with the main sequence mass between @xmath105 m@xmath51 . @xcite",
    "have shown that evolution of a binary system with 16 m@xmath51 + 10 m@xmath51 , and an initial period of 125 days , appears compatible with the pre - sn observations of sn 2011dh , and predicted that the yellow super giant star detected in the pre - sn images could be the potential progenitor candidate .",
    "our direct estimates of mass of @xmath8ni using the bolometric light curve , and property of the progenitor inferred using the mass of oxygen ejected in the explosion , the [ caii]/[oi ] ratio in the nebular phase and mass of hydrogen envelope are in very good agreement with the binary models .",
    "in this paper , we present optical photometry in @xmath0 bands and medium resolution spectroscopy of the type iib supernova sn 2011dh in nearby galaxy m51 , during 3 days to one year after the explosion .",
    "sn 2011dh reached a peak absolute @xmath1 magnitude of @xmath106 with a rise time of @xmath107 days . with an absolute @xmath4 peak magnitude of @xmath108 ,",
    "sn 2011dh is @xmath6 0.3 magnitude fainter than the mean absolute magnitude of a sample of type iib supernovae .",
    "the initial decline in magnitude within 15 days from the date of maximum ( @xmath21 ) in the @xmath1 and @xmath4 bands is found to be similar to those of sn 1993j and sn 2008ax . in the late phase , between days 170 to 360 ,",
    "a steepening is seen in the @xmath1-band light curve , while the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands show a flattening .",
    "this indicates the possibility of dust formation .",
    "the colour evolution shows that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 colours of sn 2011dh are always redder as compared to those of other stripped envelope core - collapse supernovae , which could be because of lower temperature of the supernova .",
    "simple analytic fits to the bolometric light curve of indicate that @xmath6 0.09 m@xmath7 of @xmath8ni was synthesized in the explosion .",
    "the early spectral evolution of sn 2011dh shows prominent p - cygni absorption due to balmer lines of hydrogen , the h@xmath9 absorption line is seen in the spectrum till @xmath6 60 days after explosion .",
    "the hei lines start appearing in the spectrum much before the maximum in @xmath1-band .",
    "synthetic spectra have been computed using the syn++ code and the main features in the spectra have been identified .",
    "the early photospheric temperature estimated at @xmath109  k is cooler than the estimates for other sne iib , indicating a more conducive condition for early dust formation .",
    "the emergence of forbidden lines due to [ oi ] 6300 , 6363    and [ caii ] 7291 , 7324    in the spectrum of @xmath110 days after explosion indicates the onset of the nebular phase .",
    "the [ oi ] 6300 - 6364 line shows a double peaked profile .",
    "a box shaped emission due to h@xmath9 is seen in the red wing of the [ oi ] line , which could possibly arise because of the shock - wave interaction of csm .",
    "the ejected mass of oxygen ( @xmath111  m@xmath7 ) , estimated using the [ oi ] 6300 , 6363    line flux , together with an intermediate value of the [ caii ] 7291 - 7324/[oi ] 6300 - 6364 flux ratio suggests a less massive progenitor in a binary system .",
