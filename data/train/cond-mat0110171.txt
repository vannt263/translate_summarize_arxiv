    "scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) has been used not only as a mean of microscopy , but also as a tool for nanofabrication , nanoprobing , or manipulation of atoms and molecules on surfaces.@xcite the techniques attract much interest in the fields of nano - devices and molecular electronics . in these techniques modification by tips",
    "@xcite or the migration of surface atoms caused by high electric field @xcite are utilized .",
    "dynamical processes occurring at the gap between the tip and the substrate surface is important to be understood .",
    "a combination of a stm with an electron microscope have been devised in some research groups to see the tip and the substrate surface _ `` in - situ '' _ simultaneously.@xcite those pioneer works have successfully revealed the tip - substrate gap @xcite and the tip - surface distance.@xcite more recently a plastic change of the tip apex was observed during stm operation.@xcite furthermore , stm tip was used to makea gold nanowire between the tip and the substrate.@xcite    a significant elastic deformation of the tip and the surface is noticed under stm operation @xcite or afm operation.@xcite theoretical study on the jump - to - contact demonstrated that attractive interaction between the tip and the substrate causes straining of the tip and substrate , which sometimes provoke the atom transfer.@xcite although such interaction at atomic level was investigated from force measurement by afm,@xcite contact size and the tip - surface distance , have no ways to be detected .",
    "we devised a stm holder attachable to our ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) electron microscopy,@xcite to observe the tip - substrate contact by reflection electron microscopy ( rem).@xcite although the deformation of the tip and the surface was small , rem images were sensitive enough for detecting strains of the order of @xmath5 .    here , we report rem observation of the x7 surface strained by a tungsten tip , as the tip approaches to the surface .",
    "the strain of the order of @xmath5 was first observed to have extended over a circular area of about 100 nm .",
    "the experiments were performed in the uhv electron microscope ( jem-2000fxv ) @xcite whose pressure is better than @xmath6pa . the rem - stm specimen holder ( fig.[holder ] )",
    "was devised to fit into the narrow gap ( 3.5 mm ) of the objective pole piece .",
    "the si(111 ) crystal ( 0.02@xmath7 cm , n - type ) was flash cleaned at 1200@xmath8c by passing the dc current directly through the si crystal .",
    "tungsten stm tip was sharpened by chemical etching , and preheated for cleaning in an uhv chamber before rem - stm experiment .",
    "the stm tip was approached to the substrate by a mechanical drive ( 2 mm ) and a stack piezo ( 6 m ) , and stm image is obtainable by a tube piezo scanner ( 1 m ) .",
    "the tip motion was observed directly by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "apices of tungsten tips were observed by high - resolution tem and electron diffraction pattern .",
    "they always had the ( 110 ) plane vertical to the tip axis direction and had a curvature of 2 - 6nm.@xcite because of the preheating before putting the tip into the uhv electron microscope , we have not seen heavy contaminations covering over the tip apices .",
    "after several stm scans on the x7 surface , the apices were found often to have been scraped .",
    "the scanning was usually done at sample bias of @xmath9v , and the tunneling current of 0.3na@xmath102.0na .",
    "the scraped tips were terminated with the ( 110 ) plane , which was as wide as 10 - 300 nm .",
    "such apices of stm tips were used in the following experiments .",
    "we are allowed observing stm images of the x7 surface at atomic resolution , when the truncated tip had an adatom cluster on its top.@xcite      ray diagram of the rem is illustrated in fig.[remgeo ] .",
    "the si(111 ) substrate is placed to the rem - stm holder , whose surface is inclined by an angle @xmath11 from the objective lens axis . then the incident electron beam is reflected specularly to the surface , propagating along the objective lens axis to give the rem image on a fluorescent screen .",
    "the image is projection of the sample surface , being foreshortened by a factor of @xmath12 in the direction of the propagating beam.@xcite for the specular beam of the 444 bragg reflection of the si , the image is foreshortened by a factor of 1/73 ( @xmath13rad ) at the accelerating voltage of 200kv .    when the tip is approached to the surface ,",
    "the real and its mirror image of the tip apex appear on the rem image , as shown in fig.[remimage](a ) .",
    "the distance between these apices is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the gap between the tip and the reflection plane of the si(111 ) surface . although no rheed calculation had predicted the position of the reflection plane , which should locate between the adatom and the stacking - fault layer of the x7 surface.@xcite      provided that the surface has no strain , the specular beam changes its intensity , @xmath16 , for the incident beam angle , @xmath17 , as illustrated in fig.[straincont](a ) .",
    "the rocking curve of the specular beam , a relation of intensity and incident angle , has sharp peaks at the bragg reflection conditions ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the bragg width , @xmath19 , which was the maximum half width of the specular reflected beam intensity peak , of the 444 bragg reflection of the si(111 ) crystal was calculated to be @xmath20rad on the dynamical bethe theory @xcite ( 100kv accelerating voltage was assumed in the calculation ) .",
    "the bragg width at 200kv accelerating voltage is of the same order as 10@xmath21rad . when the incident beam angle changes by an amount of the bragg width from the angle of bragg condition , the rem image changes from bright to dark .",
    "based on this criterion , we understand strain contrast in the rem image.@xcite when a compressive force is exerted on the surface , surface lattice strains as shown in fig.[straincont](b ) .",
    "provided that the incident beam satisfies the bragg condition for the un - strained surface , the incident beam does not satisfy the bragg condition for the strained area .",
    "thus , the strained area gives dark contrast , except the central area ( see fig .",
    "[ straincont](b ) ) .",
    "when the incident angle is smaller ( larger ) than the bragg angle by the bragg width for the un - strained area , the dark contrast appears only on one side of the strained area .",
    "the real and mirror images of an stm tip appear in the rem image , as reproduced in fig.[remimage](a ) .",
    "the appearance of the lattice fringes of the @xmath4 surface along the vertical direction , the [ 1@xmath220 ] direction , proves cleanliness of the surface .",
    "the tip is kept at a constant height from the surface , while the stm tip is biased by 1.0v and tunneling current of 0.8na .",
    "the real and the mirror image gave the tip - surface distance of @xmath23 nm . by further reduction of the voltage ( @xmath1v@xmath240.5v , and @xmath25na ) , the tip approached so close to the surface that the separation between the real and mirror tip images could not be resolved . in these bias voltages , a dark horizontal line appeared between the two tip images , as shown in fig.[remimage](b ) .",
    "the dark line extended over an area of 120 nm . this dark line image is due to compressive strain of the x7 surface induced by the tip .",
    "as explained before , contrast analysis confirmed the compressive strain .",
    "figure [ remtip ] shows rem image of a compressive strain , where @xmath26v and @xmath25na .",
    "the grazing angle of the incident electron beam increases from ( a ) to ( c ) , passes the bragg condition in ( b ) .",
    "the strain contrast underneath the tip is dark - bright in ( a ) , dark - dark in ( b ) and bright - dark in ( c ) .",
    "this change indicates the compressive strain .",
    "the strain of the order of @xmath5 extends over 120 nm , as seen from the length of the dark line in fig.[remtip ] .",
    "the tip - surface distance , @xmath27 , was measured as a function of the bias voltage ( @xmath28 is kept constant ) , and plotted in fig.[remtip ] .",
    "the observed @xmath27 vs. bias relationship in fig.[remtip ] do not accord with the previous one that was deduced from the conductance oscillation due to the tunneling barrier resonance.@xcite @xmath29 decreases steeply to zero as the positive bias decreases to @xmath3v , or as the negative bias increases to @xmath1v .",
    "the bias voltages that @xmath27 goes to zero are close to the valence and the conduction band edge . when the bias is close to the band edge as in the case of fig.[dvplot ] , the tip is almost touching to the sample surface .",
    "the tip had no mechanical contact , because of repulsive interaction .",
    "no trace ofmechanical contact was seen on the x7 surface after the retraction of the tip from the surface , indeed .",
    "the x7 surface was also found to be strained by the tip , when no bias voltage was applied .",
    "the tip was approached to and retracted from the surface by the tube piezo scanner .",
    "rem images for the tip motion was recorded on a videotape , and analyzed in detail .",
    "figure [ app - wdraw ] is a series of rem images , each of which show the real ( upper side ) and mirror ( lower side ) image of the tip apex .",
    "the @xmath4 lattice fringes of the si(111 ) surface were appearing always . as the tip approaches from ( a ) to ( d ) , a dark horizontal line comes out in ( b ) , disappears in ( c ) , and reappears in ( d ) . on the way back from ( d ) to ( g ) , the line contrast changes reversibly .",
    "the tip - substrate gap distance was measured in reference to the @xmath29 in fig.[app - wdraw](a ) .",
    "the @xmath27 in fig.[app - wdraw](a ) was measured directly from the rem to be 1.25 nm .",
    "further approach of the tip did not allow accurate measurement of @xmath29 value , so that the gap distance was estimated by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the elongation of the tube piezo scanner .",
    "the gap distance , then , is 0.9 nm , 0.4 nm , 0.15 nm , 0.45 nm , and 0.85 nm for ( b)-(f ) , respectively . in ( g ) , the gap distance became @xmath32 nm , which was measured directly from the rem image .",
    "the length of the dark lines in rem images in fig.[app - wdraw ] ( and other series of tip approach ) were measured as a function of the gap distance , @xmath33 , and plotted in fig.[d - leng ] . the strain for @xmath34 ( fig.[app - wdraw](d ) )",
    "is compressive , while that @xmath35 is tensile ( fig.[app - wdraw](b ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "neither attractive nor repulsive force works at the gap distance of @xmath36 ( fig.[app - wdraw](c ) and ( e ) ) . looking the length of the dark lines (",
    "the area having strained more than @xmath5rad ) in fig.[d - leng ] , the range of the strain field is found to be extremely wide .",
    "the maximum strain field for the attractive interaction extends over the area of 50 nm at the gap distance of 0.8 nm . for repulsive interaction regime ,",
    "the range extended even more than 100 nm for @xmath37 nm . we calculated the range of the compressive strain field , following the classical elastic approach @xcite by assuming various radiuses of a flat topped tip and a compressive force .",
    "however , no reasonable radius or force could explain the magnitude of the strain field seen in the rem image.@xcite    in the experiments , we did not observe for our tip to jump - to - contact with the si surface , since our tip is rigid enough . on the other hand , we observed jump - to - detach motion of our tip while withdrawal of the tip . on the withdrawal , the tensile strain contrast reaches to its maximum in fig.[app - wdraw](f ) at @xmath38 nm .",
    "its contrast is kept constant by further withdrawal ( 0.05 nm ) of the tip , but it disappears suddenly ( within one frame of the vtr recording : time after 30ms ) . in this jump - to - detach motion ,",
    "the attractive force changed from its maximum to zero , and the gap distance had changed from @xmath39 nm to @xmath40 nm ( fig.[app - wdraw](g ) ) .",
    "the reason is not clear .",
    "the tip apex had no mechanical contact with the substrate during the approach and withdrawal process , if the tip - surface distance was larger than 0.15 nm .",
    "when we push the tip to a distance closer than 0.1 nm , we began to see scratch mark on the si surface after the tip withdrawal .",
    "the tip also strained greatly . from these observations , mechanical contact between",
    "the tip and the surface begins at the gap distances larger than 0.15 nm .",
    "the present rem - stm observation of the x7 surface by a tungsten tip , thus , has revealed the strain range of 50 nm at gap distance of 0.8 nm .",
    "such strain field might cause potential gradient of the surface to excite migration of adsorbed atoms or of the surface atoms.@xcite the absolute value of the gap distances is supposed to be overestimated , since the gap distances ( fig.[remtip ] ) in stm condition are larger than the previous report.@xcite any way , the strain field of the substrate was detected first in this experiment .",
    "the strain changed tensile to compressive in relation to the attractive and repulsive force from the tip , respectively .",
    "atomic process such as jump - to - contact has not seen in the rem - stm experiment .",
    "this might be poor resolution of the rem image , and should be done by tem - stm in future .",
    "tem - stm , however , is only sensitive to the strain of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "detection of the surface strain becomes possible by rem imaging of the surface .",
    "by a combination of stm with uhv electron microscope , the x7 surface was observed simultaneously in rem and stm .",
    "the tip apex could be imaged in rem images of the specularly reflected electron beam . from the real and the mirror images of the tip",
    ", we knew the tip - surface distance directly .",
    "the tip was approached to and retracted from the sample surface with or without bias voltage being applied between the tip and the sample surface .",
    "the tensile strain was induced on the si surface when the gap distance is @xmath42 .",
    "the surface strain turns into compressive for @xmath43 .",
    "mechanical contact of the tip to the sample surface occur for @xmath44 nm . the range of the strain field , the area strained more than @xmath5 , is 50 nm in the attractive force regime , while it exceeds 100 nm in the repulsive interaction regime .",
