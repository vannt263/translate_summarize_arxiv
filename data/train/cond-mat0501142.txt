    "the behaviors of gases in nonequilibrium states have received considerable attention from the standpoint of understanding the characteristics of nonequilibrium phenomena.@xcite the kinetic theory has contributed not only to the understanding of nonequilibrium transport phenomena in gases but also to the development of general nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "it is well accepted that the boltzmann equation is one of the most reliable kinetic models for describing nonequilibrium phenomena in gas phases . in the early stage of studies on the kinetic theory ,",
    "great effort has been paid for solving kinetic model equations such as the boltzmann equation and deriving nonequilibrium velocity distribution functions and macroscopic nonequilibrium transport equations in terms of microscopic molecular quantities .",
    "these attempts were strongly related to the development of general nonequilibrium statistical physics such as linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics , onsager s reciprocal theorem and the linear response theory.@xcite    among various methods which give normal solutions of the boltzmann equation , the chapman - enskog method has been widely accepted as the most reliable method .",
    "it had been believed that burnett determined the complete second - order solution of the boltzmann equation by the chapman - enskog method.@xcite physical importance of the second - order coefficients has been also demonstrated for descriptions of shock wave profiles and sound propagation phenomena.@xcite however , it was reported that burnett s solution is not complete , and schamberg derived the precise velocity distribution function of the boltzmann equation to second order for maxwell molecules.@xcite on the other hand , because of its mathematical difficulty , the complete second - order solution of the boltzmann equation for hard - core molecules has been derived quite recently.@xcite its validity has been also demonstrated by numerical experiments of both a molecular dynamics simulation and a direct simulation monte carlo method.@xcite other kinetic models like the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) equation@xcite have been proposed mainly to avoid the mathematical difficulties in dealing with the collision term of the boltzmann equation .",
    "although it was believed that its results approximately agreed with those of the boltzmann equation , some qualitative disagreements have been found in the second - order solutions.@xcite    following its success and usefulness , the boltzmann equation is widely used in order to describe various gas - phase transport phenomena such as granular gases@xcite , plasma gases@xcite , polyatomic gases@xcite , relativistic gases@xcite and chemically reacting gases .",
    "chemical reactions in gas phases have been studied with the aid of gas collision theory . for the differential cross - section of chemical reaction ,",
    "the line - of - centers model proposed by present has been accepted as a standard model to describe the chemical reaction in gases.@xcite this model can be derived explicitly using a collision law of hard - core molecules , and the diameter of hard - core molecules is regarded as a distance between centers of monatomic molecules at contact.@xcite in equilibrium states , experimental results including the temperature dependency can be fitted by the results from the line - of - centers model.@xcite under nonequilibrium situations such as gases under a heat flux or a shear flow , their pure nonequilibrium contributions to the rate of chemical reaction have also attracted much attention.@xcite since nonequilibrium correction terms of the chemical reaction rate are quadratic functions of nonequilibrium fluxes , the explicit nonequilibrium velocity distribution function of the boltzmann equation for hard - core molecules to second order is needed to derive it based on the line - of - centers model.@xcite the pure effect of a heat flux on the chemical reaction rate has been recently calculated using the second - order velocity distribution function of the boltzmann equation for hard - core molecules.@xcite in the letter , a _ thermometer _ to measure a relation between a kinetic temperature of gases under a heat flux and a temperature of a heat bath has been also proposed .",
    "it is one of the most significant subjects in modern statistical physics to construct the nonlinear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics for a strongly nonequilibrium state beyond the local equilibrium state , called the local nonequilibrium state .",
    "zubarev@xcite has developed nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and obtained the general form of a nonequilibrium velocity distribution function with the aid of the maximum entropy principle .",
    "it is expanded to first order under some constraints to obtain the first - order nonequilibrium velocity distribution function.@xcite jou and his coworkers have derived the nonequilibrium velocity distribution function to second order by expanding it to second order under some constraints , which is called information theory.@xcite information theory has attracted interest in the development of a general framework for nonlinear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics which can describe the local nonequilibrium state . the nonequilibrium velocity distribution function from information theory has been applied to nonequilibrium systems , and some predictions were made .",
    "for example , in dilute gas systems under nonequilibrium fluxes , an anisotropic pressure and a nonequilibrium temperature which is not identical with the kinetic temperature have been predicted.@xcite there are also several applications of information theory to chemically reacting gases.@xcite however , some qualitative differences between information theory and the boltzmann equation have been recently reported , and the invalidity of information theory as universal nonlinear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has been demonstrated.@xcite    there have been no efforts to solve two - dimensional kinetic models to second order and discuss the two - dimensional second - order nonequilibrium phenomena , though two - dimensional transport phenomena have created great interest.@xcite the main aims of this paper are to reconstruct all the results obtained in refs.@xcite in the case of two dimensional , and to discuss properties of the two - dimensional nonlinear nonequilibrium phenomena which reflect the local nonequilibrium state . in secs.[solve ] and [ f2 ] , we have derived the explicit velocity distribution function of the two - dimensional steady - state boltzmann equation for hard - disk molecules to second order by the chapman - enskog method . in order to achieve that , we have extended the method we developed in ref.@xcite to the two - dimensional case .",
    "we also obtain the nonequilibrium velocity distribution functions to second order for the two - dimensional steady - state bgk equation and information theory in secs.[solvebgk ] and [ itsolve ] , respectively .",
    "all the nonlinear nonequilibrium velocity distribution functions are graphically compared in sec.[compare ] .",
    "using the two - dimensional nonequilibrium velocity distribution functions to second order , we discuss differences among those theories appearing in the two - dimensional nonlinear nonequilibrium transport phenomena in sec.[application ] . in sec.[contributioncr ] , we explain how to calculate the effect of steady heat flux on the rate of chemical reaction based on the line - of - centers model in the two - dimensional case , and apply the two - dimensional nonequilibrium velocity distribution functions to second order to calculate it .",

    "this kind of qualitative differences was detected also in the three - dimensional case.@xcite this discrepancy is due to the fact that @xmath219-dependency can not be absorbed in the single relaxation time of the bgk equation , which leads to the conclusion that the steady - state bgk equation neither capture the essence of hard - disk molecules nor possess the characteristics of any other models of molecules which interact with @xmath219-dependency .",

    "although information theory has been applied to nonequilibrium dilute gases@xcite , we have found that information theory contradicts the microscopic kinetic models : all the macroscopic quantities for information theory except for the shannon entropy @xmath193 in eq.([be56 ] ) are qualitatively different from those for the steady - state boltzmann equation and the steady - state bgk equation .",
    "these results indicate that characteristics of microscopic models appear in the local nonequilibrium state , that is , nonlinear nonequilibrium transport phenomena are sensitive to differences of kinetic models , so rather realistic models are needed when one investigates them .",
    "we can conclude that , though quite a few statistical physicists have believed the existence of a universal velocity distribution function in the nonequilibrium steady state by maximizing the shannon - type entropy@xcite , any universal nonlinear nonequilibrium velocity distribution function does not seem to exist in the two - dimensional case as well as the three - dimensional case , even when it is expressed only in terms of macroscopic quantities .",
