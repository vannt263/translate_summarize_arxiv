    "nuclear structure information is often obtained from reaction experiments .",
    "elastic scattering is the conceptually simplest process which probes the interaction between the colliding particles .",
    "the same particles in initial and final states , but different relative energies , is an inelastic process where the missing energy must be in emitted photons ( provided that the particles themselves remain non - excited ) .",
    "such cross section measurements then carry information about continuum properties of the combined system of the two particles , and corresponding cluster properties are perhaps here especially pronounced .",
    "clearly , structure and dynamics are entangled , and extraction of useful structure information is then a challenge .",
    "more and more experiments probing continuum properties are in the pipeline .",
    "cluster structures are known to be of extreme importance in light nuclei and in particular for astrophysical processes in the continuum .",
    "a number of models employ spatially limited sets of basis states where the continuum has disappeared .",
    "they provide directly structure information but such discretization is not necessarily leading to correct observable results .",
    "the dynamics of a given reaction process has been removed by assumptions of independence of decay process and initial and final scattering states .",
    "two - body scattering processes are completely determined by the phase shifts , which in principle can be reproduced by different potentials .",
    "this is especially obvious for low energies where only rather few partial waves contribute .",
    "this means that the unique constraint from cross sections is on the asymptotic behavior of the potentials which however can have different number of bound states and still precisely identical phase shifts .",
    "this immediately implies that the scattering wave functions may differ at short distances by a corresponding number of nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "structure information is related to matrix elements of an operator between initial and final states . as a consequence ,",
    "structure information is contained in the short - distance wave - function properties , and therefore we could expect a substantial interaction dependence .    in this report we shall investigate these problems by use of the simplest two - body process of inelastic @xmath4 scattering .",
    "this provides information about the continuum properties of @xmath0be .",
    "we shall calculate cross sections defined by specified initial and final state energies .",
    "we shall investigate dependence on energies and on the chosen @xmath4 interaction .",
    "we shall extract as much structure information of @xmath0be as possible , and in particular focus on @xmath5-values . however , these quantities require initial and final states connected by the electric quadrupole operator , and the appropriate continuum states are not a priory well defined .",
    "previous works provided cross sections from energies around the positions of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances in @xmath8be @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results @xcite are converging although important discrepancies still remain . in these works the structure information is extracted as @xmath5-values by assuming a breit - wigner shape for population of the decaying initial @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances in @xmath0be .",
    "no continuum background contribution is considered .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide cross sections and @xmath3-values with the highest numerical accuracy , test the dependence on how the inherent continuum state divergence is removed , and investigate the effect of a different short - distance behavior of the wave functions produced by the use of different potentials .",
    "more precisely , we shall provide cross sections for energies covering all positions of the resonances , @xmath9 , and limited to windows of final state energies around lower - lying resonances .",
    "the latter information is directly related to structure characteristics and furthermore also the quantities measured in practice in experiments .",
    "we shall compare to the scarce pieces of previous theoretical and experimental results .    in section",
    "ii we describe the theoretical background needed for the calculations .",
    "the results are collected in section iii , which contains three subsections describing , respectively , the @xmath8be spectrum and its dependence on the two - body potentials , the electric quadrupole cross sections for specific transitions , and the total cross sections for different final energy windows . the extraction of the @xmath5 transition strengths is described in section iv .",
    "we finish in section v with a short summary and the conclusions .",
    "the inelastic two - body scattering process is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite as a bremsstrahlung cross section ( see also ref .",
    "in particular , the total cross section for @xmath10-radiation is given by eq.(9 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "assuming a two - body collision involving two identical particles with charge @xmath11 and zero spin , the cross section becomes :    @xmath12 ^ 2 } ( 2\\ell+1)^2 ( 2\\ell^\\prime+1 ) \\left(\\frac{e_\\gamma}{\\hbar c } \\right)^{2\\lambda+1 }   \\bigg| \\langle \\ell 0 ; \\lambda 0| \\ell^\\prime 0\\rangle w(\\lambda \\ell^\\prime \\ell 0 ; \\ell \\ell^\\prime ) \\int_0^\\infty u_\\ell(e ,",

    "the radial two - body wave functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are solutions of the radial two - body schrdinger equation with potential @xmath23 , and they obey the large - distance boundary condition @xmath24 , \\label{asymp}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the regular and irregular coulomb functions , @xmath27 is the nuclear phase shift , and the normalization constant is determined by the orthogonality condition : @xmath28    the total bremsstrahlung cross section is finally obtained after integration over the energy of the emitted photon : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "in addition to the integration , a summation over all angular momenta , @xmath16 and @xmath31 , as well as all multipolarities , @xmath32 , has to be included in eq.([intcs ] ) .",
    "we shall avoid cluttering the notation by adding more indices . in any case",
    "we also want to keep track of the individual contributions .",
    "the measurement is simply to control relative energy of two colliding particles , and identify the same outgoing particles and measure their energies .",
    "the computed cross sections should then be obtained in close analogy to the experimental setup , where only a finite range of final relative energies is measured .",
    "this means that the integral in eq.([intcs ] ) should be performed only over this precise energy range .",
    "we shall often refer to this range as the final energy window .",
    "once a two - body potential has been chosen , the procedure is clear from eqs.([cross1 ] ) and ( [ intcs ] ) , that is , find the wave functions and perform the integrals .",
    "however , some care must be exercised in the calculation of the matrix elements because the continuum wave functions , @xmath33 , can not be normalized in coordinate space .",
    "the bare matrix elements diverge until a regularization procedure is employed .",
    "we shall follow the zeldovich prescription @xcite , which introduces the regularization factor @xmath34 in the radial integrand , such that the correct result is obtained in the limit of zero value for the zeldovich parameter @xmath35 .",
    "fortunately , this removes the unwanted large - distance contributions and the remaining physics results are uniquely defined , since they are stable for sufficiently small values of @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , the smaller the parameter @xmath35 the slower the fall off of the radial integrand , and therefore the larger the upper limit required in the radial integral in eq.([cross1 ] ) .",
    "in order to compute inelastic cross sections the only remaining decision is to choose precisely which observable should be computed , that is which energy interval has to be employed in the integration ( [ intcs ] ) .",
    "except for practical experimental difficulties it is possible to choose any energy interval allowing emission of one photon .",
    "the advantage is that no additional information is required , as for example definition of a resonance or knowledge of the decay mechanism through an intermediate structure .",
    "this information is implicitly contained in the continuum wave functions . note that when using eq.([asymp ] ) the energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( and therefore also @xmath36 ) are treated as continuum variables ( the continuum is not discretized ) .",
    "the integral ( [ intcs ] ) can be easily performed within any arbitrary energy limits by choosing an also arbitrary small grid for the photon energy",
    ".    direct comparison of precisely the same observables is then possible and desirable .",
    "however , an important question is whether the structure information can be disentangled from the measured cross sections .",
    "this is a standard procedure for bound states , and the obvious continuation is to apply the procedure to resonances .",
    "one option is to focus on final energy windows around peaks in the cross sections corresponding to ( otherwise known ) resonances .",
    "interpretation in terms of multipole transitions may then be possible but may be also ambiguous if the results depend too much on the chosen energy windows .",
    "it is crucial to know if the structure information can in principle be extracted .",
    "in fact , most theoretical results are obtained without even realizing this problem because the continuum already is discretized and resonances therefore model dependently defined .",
    "finally , it is also important to know the dependence of these observables on the two - body potential . after all , different potentials providing identical phase shifts could produce wave functions with a different short - distance behavior , which therefore could also produce different radial integrals in eq.([cross1 ] ) and different cross sections .    in the following section all these issues are investigated for the @xmath4 scattering process .",
    "the @xmath4 reaction is specified by initial and final state energies , as well as by the energy window for measured final energies .",
    "the angular momentum is at best only indirectly controlled in the experiment .",
    "however , knowledge of the two - body resonance properties allow substantiated expectation of dominating individual angular momenta at certain energy ranges . in particular , the cross section is expected to have peaks for incident energies in the vicinity of the @xmath0be resonances .",
    "for the two - body @xmath37-structure of @xmath0be only even relative angular momenta and positive parity are allowed .",
    "this means that the lowest multipolarity of an electromagnetic transition must have @xmath1 character .",
    "therefore , the cross section is given by eq.([cross1 ] ) for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and where only even values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are possible .",
    "transitions with higher multipolarity , where @xmath40 is the next allowed , are clearly smaller by several orders of magnitude @xcite .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\(a ) ref.@xcite , ( b ) ref.@xcite , ( c ) ref.@xcite , ( d ) ref.@xcite    following the procedure just described , and using the computed cross sections shown in fig.[fig4 ] , we obtain the @xmath41-values given in table  [ tab2 ] for the different reactions under investigation . in the table the labels ` wide ' , ` medium ' , and ` narrow ' refer to the sizes of the three final energy windows used in fig.[fig4 ] for each reaction . as a general rule , of course",
    ", the smaller the size of the window the lower the maximum in the cross section , and therefore the smaller the value of @xmath41 .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath42 reaction , where the ` wide ' and ` medium ' windows produce the same cross section and therefore also the same @xmath43-width .    in @xcite ,",
    "a value of @xmath44 mev is given for the @xmath42 reaction .",
    "this value is consistent with the 7.7 mev obtained in our calculation , as expected due to the good agreement obtained between our cross section and the one given in @xcite ( open circles and solid curve in fig.[fig1]a ) .",
    "the same happens with the @xmath45 .",
    "the cross section obtained in @xcite agrees well with our calculation ( open circles and solid curve in fig.[fig1]b ) , whose maximum is very similar to the one shown in fig.[fig4]b for the ` medium'-size energy window ( @xmath46 ) . for this reason",
    "the @xmath47 ev obtained in our calculation for this particular case agrees well with the 0.46 ev given in @xcite . in @xcite also a very similar value of 0.45 ev",
    "is given .",
    "after having computed the @xmath41 values , eq.([eq7 ] ) permits us to obtain the transition strength .",
    "however , due to the @xmath48 exponent , the value of @xmath49 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath36 used .",
    "already for @xmath39 a variation of about 4% in @xmath36 amounts to an about 20% variation in the extracted transition strength . in our calculations",
    "the photon energy ( @xmath15 ) has been taken with @xmath13 equal to the energy at which the cross sections in fig.[fig4 ] have a maximum ( 2.7 mev in ( a ) , 10.6 mev in ( b ) , 41.0 mev in ( c ) , and 70 mev in ( d ) ) , and @xmath14 is taken to be the resonance energy in the final state . when this is done we obtain the values denoted in table  [ tab2 ] as @xmath50 .    again",
    ", for the two largest energy windows in the @xmath42 reaction , the good agreement with the @xmath41 value given in @xcite implies also a good agreement with the @xmath50 value given in the same reference ( 75 w.u . @xmath51",
    "@xmath52@xmath53 ) .",
    "note that our computed value is larger than the one obtained in @xcite in spite of the fact that our computed @xmath41 is smaller .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with eq.([eq7 ] ) which implies that a smaller @xmath41 should produce also a smaller @xmath50 .",
    "the reason is the large dependence on @xmath36 mentioned above .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath50 given in @xcite are consistent with @xmath54 mev , while we have used a value of 2.6 mev . for @xmath55 mev ,",
    "use of @xmath56 mev or @xmath57 mev would reduce the @xmath50 value down to 65.5 @xmath58 or 54.6 @xmath58 , respectively . due to the smaller relative value of @xmath36 compared to the other reactions ,",
    "the @xmath42 reaction is more sensitive to small variations in @xmath36 than the other cases .",
    "another remarkable fact is that our result ( and the one in @xcite ) clearly disagrees with the 14.8 @xmath52@xmath53 given in @xcite where a quantum monte carlo calculation is performed .    for the @xmath45 reaction the @xmath50 value of 19 w.u .",
    "( @xmath59 @xmath52@xmath53 ) given in @xcite agrees well with our calculation ( as expected again due the good agreement in the @xmath41 value ) . in @xcite the same value of 19 w.u .",
    "is given . in our calculation",
    "a value of @xmath60 mev has been used .",
    "as discussed above , a small variation of @xmath36 is not as relevant as in the @xmath42 case .",
    "for example , in the ` medium ' window case , @xmath61 mev or @xmath62 mev gives rise to @xmath63 @xmath58 or 19.4 @xmath58 , still pretty similar to the value given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "it is surprising that the quantum monte carlo calculation shown in @xcite , contrary to what happened for the @xmath42 reaction , agrees now very well with our result , since in @xcite a value of 18.2 @xmath52@xmath53 is given .",
    "more recently , an experimental value of @xmath64 @xmath52@xmath53 has been given in @xcite for the @xmath50 transition strength for the @xmath45 .",
    "this value agrees as well with our results .",
    "the second method that we use to obtain the transition strengths follows from the well known relation between the cross section @xmath65 in eq.([intcs ] ) and @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , this relation reads @xcite : @xmath67 ^ 2 } \\frac{1}{k^2 } \\left ( \\frac{e_\\gamma}{\\hbar c } \\right)^{2\\lambda+1 }   } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\frac{2(2j+1)}{(2j_a+1)(2j_b+1 ) } \\frac{d{\\cal b}^{(e\\lambda)}}{de}(j\\rightarrow j^\\prime ) , \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the angular momenta of the two colliding particles ( @xmath70 in our case ) and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the reduced mass ) .",
    "we can then choose to define another suitable value of @xmath73 , that is by integration of @xmath74 over the energy @xmath13 , followed by dividing the result by the factors multiplying @xmath66 in eq.([eq9 ] ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath75 . here the choice of the average value of @xmath36 is essential due to the @xmath48 exponent , as discussed when extracting @xmath76 from eq.([eq7 ] ) .",
    "we proceed also in this case as done in eq.([eq7 ] ) , i.e. , we take this average value to be @xmath15 where @xmath13 is the energy at which the cross sections in fig.[fig4 ] have a maximum and @xmath14 is the resonance energy in the final state .    the results obtained for the cases shown in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "are denoted in table  [ tab2 ] by @xmath77 .",
    "the integration over @xmath13 of the cross sections in fig.[fig4 ] are made from 0 to the energy of the first zero ( 3.8 mev , 13.3 mev , 125 mev , and 250 mev in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively ) .    having in mind the large dependence of the computed transition strengths on the photon energy and the two completely different approaches used , the agreement between the @xmath50 and the @xmath77 values given in table  [ tab2 ] are quite reasonable . in all the cases @xmath77 is smaller than @xmath50 , especially for the @xmath78 reaction , where the difference is essentially of a factor of 2 .",
    "the best agreement between both calculations is found for the two cases where the resonances in @xmath8be are well established , namely , the @xmath42 and the @xmath45 reactions ( keep in mind that the @xmath42 is particularly sensitive to @xmath36 ) .",
    "we investigate electromagnetic transitions between continuum states .",
    "the corresponding bound state problem is very well established and the extension to the continuum should be straightforward .",
    "this seems not to be controversial , since the resonances are both the most prominent structures in the continuum and the natural extension of the series of discrete bound states .",
    "however , in between resonances are well defined continuum states , and the resonances themselves are distributed over energy intervals in accordance with their widths .",
    "thus , at least at first glance the extension to the continuum is not well defined .    in spite of these theoretical reservations , an increasing amount of experimental activities",
    "are documented by a number of recent publications .",
    "the demand for theoretical understanding and interpretation of measured continuum properties are therefore increasing .",
    "the simplest non - trivial problem containing information about continuum structure is inelastic scattering of two particles .",
    "already three particles present additional difficulties .",
    "since the two - body problem is technically much simpler , and still exhibits the generic characteristics of continuum properties , we choose to illustrate the concepts by @xmath4 scattering using well - tested realistic potentials .",
    "we first present the expression for the inelastic scattering cross section as function of initial and final state energies .",
    "this implicitly defines the energy of a necessarily emitted photon , which does not have to be detected if particles and energies of both initial and final states are precisely known .",
    "the bosonic nature of the @xmath37-article limits the relative angular momenta to be even and the parities to be positive .",
    "then the lowest multipolarity of the emitted photon is @xmath6 , but @xmath7 , @xmath79 are allowed as well .",
    "the cross section expression is deceivingly simple and , except for the kinematic factors , similar to the corresponding bound state transition probability .",
    "however , one divergence must be removed before meaningful results can be obtained , that is the unnormalizable resonance wave functions must be regularized .",
    "the numerical calculations are then performed in close agreement with a possible experimental procedure , that is select an appropriate interval of final state energy and compute the cross section as function of initial energy .",
    "we first compare results from different phase - shift identical potentials and from the few existing previous computations of specific transitions .",
    "the results from different potentials are virtually indistinguishable , while previous results ( @xmath80 ) deviate substantially for an initial energy around that of the @xmath7 state .",
    "the chosen energy interval is the window where a perceived experiment would measure energies of the outgoing @xmath37-particles .",
    "the dominating contributions come , as intuitively expected , from transitions between resonance states .",
    "the cross section is now computed as a function of initial energy for photon emissions into an energy window of width comparable to the width of the final state resonance . when the initial energy is within the energy interval , allowing zero photon energy , an unphysical bump appears .",
    "this infrared catastrophe is due to omission of the elastic scattering channel .",
    "we remove the bump by omitting a corresponding peak , low - lying and well - defined , corresponding to inclusion of large distances before regularizing in the calculation of matrix elements .    increasing the size of the energy window obviously increases the cross section .",
    "if the transition would be entirely from resonance to resonance , we should find convergence with energy window size .",
    "however , this is only seen for @xmath81 , while the other cases keep increasing with inclusion of states beyond the width of the resonance .",
    "the largest contributions are by far for initial energy within a resonance width , but even then non - resonant contributions must be responsible for the continued increase of the cross section .",
    "this is part of a smooth and significant continuous background , and variation of window size allows observable distinction between resonance and background contributions .",
    "the general size of the cross section increases rather strongly with initial energy , but the largest resonance to resonance contributions at the same time correspond to larger photon energies .",
    "however , the actual increase is rather an order of magnitude smaller than dictated by the fifth order dependence of @xmath1-transitions .",
    "it is remarkable that an initial energy close to the established @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonance positions plus half their widths produce vanishing cross sections , independent of window size , for the dominating @xmath1-transitions .",
    "this reflects destructive interference between background and resonance amplitudes further increase of the energy above the resonance peaks leads again to rising cross sections . for sufficiently separated resonance peaks such an increase could produce dominating contribution between the resonances and a significant contribution within the next resonance peak . in both cases",
    "this amounts to pieces of non - resonant transitions between continuum states .",
    "several transitions are allowed by angular momentum rules without corresponding to resonance - to - resonance transitions .",
    "this is already suggested by the previously discussed increase above the resonances , but a number of other transitions may also contribute .",
    "these are first of all @xmath1-transitions between continuum states of the same angular momenta , which have been called intra - band transitions although they have nothing to do with bands .",
    "also `` reverse '' transition , @xmath82 , contribute .",
    "these smaller transitions can not in principle be experimentally singled out , but our estimates show they have to be included on the @xmath83  % level in theoretical comparison . one way to emphasize these terms is by using the theoretical guidance to focus on initial energies between resonances , where their contributions are comparatively larger .",
    "traditionally , structure information has been deduced from scattering and reaction experiments .",
    "this is straightforward for bound - to - bound state transitions where photon energy is well defined , and strength functions are simply related to decay rates and to cross sections .",
    "however , for continuum - to - continuum transitions the relation is more complicated , even though the same ingredients enter as matrix elements and photon energy .",
    "first the problem must be defined as related to resonance properties .",
    "this immediately emphasizes the ambiguity since resonances only can be seen in observable quantities as peaks in cross sections .",
    "a resonance state is not defined as a state with specific properties .",
    "we show that extraction of both electromagnetic decay rates and transition probabilities is inherently ambiguous but possible to define and subsequently estimate with some uncertainty related to the chosen definition .",
    "we use two definitions , that is the first where a breit - wigner cross section is fitted very close to the resonance peak energy resulting in a normalization closely related to the dominating decay rate . the transition probability",
    "is then deduced from the bound - to - bound state expression with a photon energy defined as the difference between resonance energies .",
    "the second method is first to integrate the cross section , limited to the corresponding transition , over the initial energy from zero and across the resonance until its is zero .",
    "subsequently we do as for the first method , i.e. define the appropriate photon energy and use the same relations to transition probability .",
    "the two methods turn out to give comparable results for the established @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances .",
    "the results are consistent with the only measured value for the @xmath80 transition , and in agreement with one of the two previous cluster model calculations .",
    "bound state approximations of resonances already discretized the continuum and the few existing results show agreement for the @xmath80 transition , but rather large discrepancy for the @xmath81 transition .    in summary , we have investigated the electromagnetic continuum transitions by computing two - body inelastic scattering cross sections .",
    "we discuss results as functions of energies and angular momenta of initial and final states .",
    "this includes the dominating resonance - to - resonance contributions as well as other combinations contributing to non - resonance smooth background decays .",
    "definitions of decay rates and transition probabilities are shown to be inherently ambiguous .",
    "we present two simple and intuitively appealing possibilities where structure information is extracted .",
    "the experimental techniques are rapidly refined and a variety of details can be expected in the near future . the perspective and the interest is now to extend these investigations beyond the two - body level .",
    "this means first of all formulation and calculation for three - body systems in the continuum .",
