    "the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) in an asymptotic giant branch star ( agb ) is a very active region .",
    "any agb star will lose mass in the form of a slow wind at a rate that will significantly affect the mass of the star as well as enriching the interstellar medium with nuclear processed material .",
    "this produces a circumstellar envelope of escaping dust and gas particles . in the zone just above the photosphere , out to 5@xmath7 ( stellar radius ) , the extended atmosphere experiences periodic shocks , so each period is divided into intervals of mass outflow and infall . in this zone , the cycle - averaged temperature drops as the wind flows away from the star , from about 3100 k at the photosphere to @xmath8 750 k at 5.5@xmath9 @xcite ; cooling takes place by line radiation from various molecules , especially h@xmath10o .",

    "some molecular species are formed in an equilibrium process deep in the atmosphere and are destroyed in the outer parts of the outflow by interstellar ultraviolet radiation ( h@xmath10 , co , h@xmath10o ) .",
    "other species , for example sio , are depleted due to condensation on dust particles at a few stellar radii @xcite .",
    "the sio maser zone is thought to be shaped by a combination of shocks from stellar pulsations , gravity and possibly magnetic effects , with radiation pressure on dust becoming possible towards the outer region .",
    "sio masers are seen in rings , with faint or no emission along the line of sight to the star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to tangential beaming from an accelerating , approximately spherical wind , where masers have the deepest amplification paths if they are at similar velocities and in a similar plane of the sky to the star .",
    "studying the magnetic field properties is done by investigating the polarization morphology of the maser emission .",
    "the maser emission is significantly linearly polarized but circular polarization is weaker , as expected for a non - paramagnetic molecule @xcite .",
    "fractional circular polarization of sio masers in late - type stars from single - dish observations is @xmath11 @xcite while the degree of linear polarization is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "there are two explanations suggested for the linear polarization of sio masers .",
    "polarization can be produced by the magnetic field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , in the absence of a magnetic field , anisotropic pumping can produce strongly polarized maser emission @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed as the cause of the tangentially polarized maser emission seen in the map of sio masers observed by the vlba @xcite .",
    "if it is magnetic in origin , the linear polarization position angle provides information about the structure of the magnetic field in circumstellar envelopes .",

    "we have 23 epochs of data for r cas .",
    "data were recorded at each vlba antenna in dual - circular polarization in two 4 mhz windows , each digitally sampled at the full nyquist rate of 8 mbps in 1-bit quantization .",
    "the lower spectral window was centred at a fixed frequency corresponding to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 sio transition , at an assumed rest frequency of 43.12207 ghz and a systemic velocity v@xmath25 = + 24 km s@xmath23 .",
    "r cas was observed for three 45-minutes periods evenly spread over the 8 hour duration of the run .",
    "adjacent to each r cas observation , 5 minutes was spent observing the continuum calibrator 0359 + 509 at the same frequency as r cas .",

    "this configuration produced auto- and cross - power spectra in each 4 mhz baseband with a nominal velocity spacing of @xmath3 0.2 km.s@xmath23 .",
    "we reduced the data using the standard approach to vlbi spectroscopy within the nrao aips package ( http://www.aips.nrao.edu/cook.html ) .",
    "we processed the visibility data using the the semi - automated spectral - line polarization calibration pipeline which was originally written by diamond in 1998 , based on the formalism in @xcite and developed further by @xcite ( for more detail see @xcite ) .",
    "after the pipeline processing , we noticed that there were systematic offsets in flux density of a few to 15% between ll and rr spectra for each epoch .",
    "we assumed that the net circular polarization of sio across the band is zero and the total intensity calibration is correct .",
    "this enabled us to calculate corrections to align the flux scales for ll and rr and obtain realistic values of stokes @xmath26 , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "the absolute electric vector position angle ( evpa ) for any linearly polarized emission is unknown because there is no instrumental measurement of absolute r - l phase difference in the reference antenna of the vlba and in the vla , but the vla can provide absolute astronomical calibration of evpa relative to a small subset of primary astronomical calibrators , given the lower spatial resolution of the array .",
    "we used the vla to transfer absolute polarization calibration to vlba data via the compact secondary polarization calibrator ( 0359 + 509 ) which was observed by both arrays on 19@xmath27 dec 1999 .",
    "the same reference antenna kp was used in the reduction of all epochs of vlba data and the polarization angle stability is likely to be better than 35@xmath4 ( c. walker private communication ) .",

    "we estimated the uncertainties based on ( beam size)/(signal - to - noise ratio ) , as appropriate for a sparse array ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we formed the linearly polarized intensity @xmath33 the fractional circular polarization @xmath34 the fractional linear polarization @xmath35 and the electric vector polarization angle evpa    @xmath36    ( e.g. as defined by @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we measured the angular fwhm ( @xmath37 ) of the total intensity components by deconvolving the restoring beam from the measured size .",
    "this was used to estimate the brightness temperature @xmath38 from the integrated intensity .",

    "we note that @xmath40 and @xmath39 may be underestimated , as figs b1 - 3 in @xcite show that a significant amount of total intensity flux is resolved out .",
    "there is no clear , systematic difference between the effect on brighter or fainter emission , so we suggest that the main effect is to increase the uncertainty in @xmath42 , but it could be somewhat overestimated if the fainter emission is more diffuse , leading to @xmath39 being more underestimated",

    "this is consistent with the prediction of @xcite when the angle @xmath13 between the magnetic field and the line of sight changes from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , if the magnetic field is radial with respect to the star .",

    "[ f6 ] shows the relationship between linear polarization and total intensity in the whole maser shell and in the inner ring ( radius 25 mas ) .",

    "the highest fractional polarization , at @xmath55= 0.744 , comes mainly from the inner shell .",
    "the fractional polarization is also higher in the inner shell from @xmath55= 0.873 to @xmath55= 1.234 . at later epochs , the whole shell has higher polarization but at epoch 1.432 and later , most of the emission comes from the inner shell .",
    "we investigated the variation of mean linear polarization as a function of stellar pulsation phase in fig .",
    "we calculated these values by averaging over all components in each epoch .",
    "the error bars represent the standard deviation of average fractional linear polarization . over the whole shell , the mean linear polarization rises from @xmath55 = 0.158 until @xmath55= 0.744 when it reaches the maximum value .",
    "the mean fractional polarization then drops abruptly from the maximum to reach its minimum at @xmath55= 0.873 .",

    "[ f6 ] shows that the fractional polarization tends to be greater when the total intensity is weaker",
    "[ f8 ]  [ f11 ] show that this is often due to one or two narrow spectral regions , usually near the centre of the spectra , which have high fractional polarization .",
    "these are associated with the inner shell , see @xmath55 0.675 , 0.744 and 0.956 in the first cycle .",
    "similar behaviour is seen in the second cycle at several epochs .",
    "thus , there is a distinct tendency for higher fractional polarized intensity to be associated with weaker total intensity and with the inner shell .",
    "the emission at more extreme velocities tends to come from the inner shell , as projected on the sky .",
    "this is not surprising since , for a spherical shell with a radial velocity field , we would expect to see the most red- and blue - shifted emission close to the line of sight to the star . note",
    "that red - shifted emission within the innermost 25 mas ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) must be on the near side of the star , seen in infall .",
    "there are no obviously cyclic repeating trends in the second cycle compared with the first .",
    "the first half of the first cycle shows lower fractional polarization in the inner shell for most spectral features whilst the inner shell dominates the polarization in the second half of the cycle . in the second cycle ,",
    "most of the polarization comes from the inner shell but there is no clear dependence on phase .    what does this imply ?",
    "if a magnetic field is responsible for polarization , this would be expected to be stronger nearer the star , and might also be enhanced by shock compression . since the shock crossing time would not necessarily be an exact multiple of the stellar period , this could produce the out - of - phase enhancement .",
    "if , on the other hand , the mechanism were radiative , that could also be strongest in the inner shell but would be expected to follow the stellar phase , so this is less likely .",
    "if we use the estimate of @xmath58 based on equating the thermal energy density with the energy density in the magnetic field , we expect the alfvn speed @xmath59 and sound speed @xmath60 to be similar .",
    "we calculated the sound speed by using the relation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the adiabatic constant , @xmath63 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath64 is the effective temperature in the masing region .",
    "we found the sound speed @xmath65 2.77 km s@xmath23 .",
    "the total random energy in the gas is likely to be slightly higher due to other turbulence .    the alfvn speed @xmath59 is given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total mass density for well - coupled fluid and it is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the permeability of vacuum ( @xmath70 ) h m@xmath23 .",
    "from @xcite we found the total density is @xmath71@xmath72 at the midpoint in the maser shell ( @xmath73 cm ) .",
    "we found @xmath743.5 km s@xmath23 using @xmath75 mg , or higher if the values of @xmath58 from @xcite are considered .",
    "thus , in the sio maser clumps , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are similar . in a more diffuse , highly - ionised region , with lower density and poorer coupling",
    ", @xmath59 could be considerably higher .",
    "[ s5 ]    the sio maser emission is significantly linearly polarized .",
    "most of the linear polarization vectors are either perpendicular or tangential to the projected shell , but other angles can be seen . during the first cycle , up to phase 1.158 , two - thirds of epochs have the majority of the emission with polarization angles parallel to radial direction , i.e. parallel to the direction of outflow of the first cycle .",
    "emission with perpendicular position angles is commonest in the other five epochs .",
    "emission with intermediate polarization position angles dominates the remaining epochs , but the intensity tends to be lower leading to greater uncertainties .",
    "the bimodal distribution of evpa is consistent with that reported by @xcite in vlba observations of sio masers in mira variable stars at 7 mm .",
    "they reported that for some features the evpa are tangential while for the others are radial .",
    "the linear polarization evpa is predominantly tangential to the projected intensity shell in the vlba observation toward tx cam @xcite .",
    "this pattern has been confirmed in further observations toward tx cam and irc+10011 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found there was no prevalent pattern of evpa in any observed stars .",
    "our data are in the limit g@xmath76 r @xmath77 , which indicates that the @xcite ( gkk ) solutions for the linear polarization are applicable , i.e. the standard interpretation for the radially and tangentially evpa orientations relative to projected magnetic field is applicable .",
    "this result is consistent with that reported by @xcite toward tx cam .",
    "the high brightness temperatures observed indicate that the r cas masers are predominantly saturated so we consider the gkk model for saturated emission .",
    "we used the gkk model to estimate the depth , @xmath78 , above the midplane of the shell , of the feature showing an abrupt 90@xmath52 polarization angle change , see fig  [ f15 ] . at the point where the ( dashed ) line of sight crosses the vertical magnetic field line , in the plane of the sky ,",
    "the angle between the magnetic field direction and the line of sight , @xmath13 , is @xmath79 and @xmath80 evpa @xmath81 with respect to an axis perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction .",
    "when @xmath13 reaches 55@xmath52 ( the van vleck angle ) , the evpa becomes parallel to the direction of the magnetic field as projected against the plane of the sky . at this point , eq .",
    "[ e11 ] gives @xmath78 equivalent to @xmath82 mas or 2.6 au .",
    "@xmath83    if the magnetic field is radial , then the preponderance of evpa parallel to the radial direction ( during the first cycle , with the best quality data , section  [ sec : linpol ] ) suggests that a substantial fraction of the masers which we detect come from a region at least @xmath84 au deep with respect to the plane of the sky containing the star .",
    "this suggests a shell thickness of @xmath85 mas or 0.8 au , which is indeed similar to or less than the values of d@xmath44 given in table 1 .",
    "the shell thickness varies from about 1/5 to 2/3 of the shell radius , error - weighted mean 1/3",

    "point the maximum line of sight through the shell is @xmath86.,width=321 ]    the percentage of the linear polarization is m@xmath87 11@xmath88 58@xmath2 averaged over features for each epoch . the highest fractional polarization , from the inner shell , is seen in some features in epochs where the total intensity is lower .",
    "there is a tendency at all epochs for the fractional polarization in the inner shell to be greater at the line peaks .",
    "[ f8 ] to  [ f11 ] do not show any other relationships between fractional polarization and velocity .",
    "neither is there any discernible correlation between @xmath13 and velocity .",
    "the changes in the fractional linear polarization strength are probably due to fluctuations in the maser amplification process rather than the magnetic field strength .",
    "the changes in polarization vector orientation are likely to be due to small variations in the magnetic field direction which is possibly caused by local turbulence ( see section  [ zeint ] ) .",
    "our estimates of the magnetic field strength in the maser region make pumping models based on radiation - driven anisotropies in the magnetic sublevel populations highly unlikely .",
    "a few isolated features with fractional polarization apparently exceeding 100% can be explained if there is structure in the ionised fraction or the magnetic field on scales @xmath575 mas but the total intensity emission is smooth on larger scales and a greater proportion is resolved out by the vlba . since the alfvn speed is unlikely to exceed the sound speed significantly , and disturbances at either velocity would take @xmath89 yr to cross a 5-mas clump , intrinsic variability is unlikely . however , faraday rotation is not negligible at 7 mm wavelength .",
    "we found that it is @xmath90 for masers propagating through the depth of the sio shell , using our estimate of the magnetic field strength @xmath91 g based on the energy balance , or slightly higher if considering the values of @xmath58 measured by @xcite .",
    "if there are small - scales inhomogeneities in the ionised fraction of the stellar wind , this will affect the propagation of the polarized emission .",
    "the small - scale structure seems to be imposed on the maser polarization between the emitting material and the observer but the effect must occur close to the star where the magnetic field is strong enough .",
    "this mechanism is also likely to affect other maser features with high observed fractional linear polarization , such that although the measured @xmath92=1158 percent , the higher values might be approximately halved if all the emission was measured by the interferometer .",
    "we are , therefore , probably within the limit of the gkk model , wherein the mean fractional linear polarization can be up to 33 percent .",
