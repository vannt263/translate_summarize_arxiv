    "the maxwell field has played a prominent role in the theories of dielectrics for two mostly disconnected reasons .",
    "first , in the case of a homogeneous field produced by a planar capacitor , one gets the direct experimental access to the maxwell field @xmath1 through the voltage on the plates @xmath2 and the distance between them @xmath3 : @xmath4 .",
    "the response of the dielectric to the external field is therefore conveniently represented in terms of the susceptibility to the maxwell field .",
    "the second reason is that the scalar electrostatic potential @xmath5 is the solution of the dielectric boundary value problem when local constitutive relations are applied .",
    "the field @xmath6 follows directly from that solution as @xmath7.@xcite    the first reason for the importance of @xmath1 can be viewed as both an advantage and disadvantage since @xmath6 itself is never accessible experimentally and only the line integral @xmath8 , producing the voltage @xmath2 , can be measured.@xcite in the case of an inhomogeneous field there is no way to extract the field from the integral and experiment generally does not have direct access to the inhomogeneous maxwell field .",
    "the problem was realized already at the time of birth of the electromagnetic theory . since",
    "inhomogeneous fields can not be accessed directly , thompson suggested to use small cavities to measure internal fields inside dielectrics.@xcite this approach has in fact been realized by modern - day spectroscopy , which allows one to evaluate the local field acting on a dye molecule through the field - induced shift of its spectral line.@xcite however , the connection between such a local field and the macroscopic maxwell field has been elusive beyond the standard prescriptions of the dielectric theory.@xcite in addition , the ability to spatially resolve the distribution of the electric field and inhomogeneous polarization within molecular systems of nanometer scale has been limited.@xcite    from the theoretical perspective , the maxwell field is well defined by the coulomb law . the starting point is the overall microscopic electric field @xmath9 , combining the field @xmath10 of the external charges ( vacuum field ) with the electric field of all molecular bound charges distributed with the charge density @xmath11 ( `` b '' stands for the bound charge ) .",
    "the result is obviously @xmath12 where @xmath13 the primes here and below denote vector and scalar fields taken at the point @xmath14 , e.g. , @xmath15 .",
    "the maxwell field is produced from this equation as the result of two steps : ( i ) statistical average @xmath16 of the instantaneous @xmath9 over the configurations of a statistical ensemble and ( ii ) coarse graining of @xmath16 over a `` physically small '' volume averaging out the microscopic correlations between the molecules of the material.@xcite this volume is not precisely defined and , in fact , is never explicitly involved .",
    "the theory , as it is formulated for bulk dielectrics and interfaces , instead introduces coarse graining through constitutive relations as we discuss next .    by taking the divergence of @xmath9 and substituting @xmath17 for the density of the external charge @xmath18 , one arrives at @xmath19 .",
    "further , due to the conservation of charge , the instantaneous density of bound charge can be replaced with the divergence of the polarization vector field @xmath20 , such as @xmath21.@xcite one arrives at the equation for instantaneous fields @xmath22 which looks very much like the standard maxwell equation , except that the fields in this equation refer to an arbitrary statistical configuration of the system .",
    "of course , this equation is just a different form of the coulomb law , which applies to microscopic dimensions and arbitrary configurations of charges .",
    "the two - step averaging and coarse graining procedure mentioned above will produce the average smoothed - out fields @xmath6 and @xmath23 and the corresponding electric displacement vector @xmath24 .",
    "the maxwell equation for this coarse grained displacement vector follows from eq .   as @xmath25 .",
    "equation and its coarse grained version still can not be solved without applying a closure relation between @xmath20 and @xmath9 or between @xmath23 and @xmath6 .",
    "the connection between microscopic fields @xmath20 and @xmath9 is a complex problem of statistical mechanics of liquids.@xcite it is therefore assumed that coarse graining helps in eliminating this complexity and leads to local constitutive relations between coarse grained fields @xmath26 this constitutive relation thus establishes the direct proportionality between the vector fields @xmath23 and @xmath6 through the susceptibility @xmath27 , which is a scalar for isotropic materials .",
    "empirical evidence suggests that this approximation , when used for macroscopic dielectrics , yields the bulk dielectric susceptibility @xmath28 , which is a material property , i.e. , a parameter characterizing bulk dielectric and independent of the sample shape ( the surface effects die off in the macroscopic limit ) . correspondingly , the dielectric constant of bulk dielectric",
    "@xmath29 is a material property as well .",
    "this result is quite non - trivial since even for coarse grained vector fields the susceptibility @xmath30 to the field of external charges @xmath10 does not share insensitivity to the surface effects ( boundary conditions ) .",
    "@xmath30 is not a material property , and it depends on the shape of the sample through the dielectric boundary value problem .",
    "given that the inhomogeneous maxwell field @xmath6 is not accessible experimentally , most problems of interest for applications involving inhomogeneous fields ( solvation of molecules , solvent - induced shifts of spectral lines , interfacial problems , etc . )",
    "are formulated in terms of the response to an inhomogeneous external electric field @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , the maxwell field has to be introduced in order to solve the problem since only this field is believed to provide local constitutive relations between @xmath6 and @xmath23 required to arrive at the poisson equation .",
    "the locality of the maxwell field for inhomogeneous external fields does not have firm experimental support and is likely to be an approximation .",
    "this difficulty is responsible for many problems arising in the general problem of electric polarization of interfaces.@xcite    the problem of interfacial polarization is solved in dielectric theories by replacing the microscopic fields @xmath9 and @xmath20 in each point of the interface with the corresponding coarse grained fields and then applying the local constitutive relation to each point of the interface . when substituted to eq .",
    ", it leads to the poisson equation for @xmath6 fully specified in terms of external charges .",
    "however , there is no factual coarse graining when this procedure is applied to microscopic problems , and it is nearly impossible even to define an algorithm of volume coarse graining when fields are changing on the scale of molecular dimensions . the poisson equation is obtained in such cases by direct substitution @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the subsequent use of the constitutive equation . as mentioned , coarse graining of microscopic fields is not achieved directly by averaging over a judiciously chosen volume , but is produced by applying a specific local form of the constitutive relation .",
    "the smooth function @xmath6 obtained from the solution of the poisson equation then leads to a smooth @xmath23 , instead of a highly oscillatory function characteristic of interfaces.@xcite it is the constitutive relation that replaces coarse graining over a small volume in converting the microscopic into macroscopic fields .",
    "since coarse graining is in fact not performed , one can adopt a somewhat different form of the constitutive relation involving only the statistically averaged fields in the interface @xmath33 of course , eq .",
    "is an approximation .",
    "the question we address here is how to build a consistent theory of interfacial polarization when this approximation is applied .",
    "the advantage of eq .   over eq .",
    "is that , in contrast to volume coarse graining , statistical averages are well - defined even on the microscopic length - scale and one can proceed with ensemble - based algorithms of defining susceptibilities . in other words , in contrast to smoothly varied functions @xmath23 and @xmath6 in eq .   the corresponding fields in eq",
    ".   will be highly oscillatory , as usually produced by liquid - state theories and numerical simulations .",
    "we do not intend to apply eq .   to the entire interface , but only to the dividing surface separating the solute from the solvent . in this way we connect the microscopic calculations to the electrostatic boundary value problem .    if the constitutive relation is the only step separating the microscopic coulomb law in eq .   from the dielectric boundary value problem ,",
    "one wonders if this procedure can be supplemented with susceptibilities reflecting the microscopic structure of the polarized interface , i.e. , the susceptibility @xmath27 in eq .  .",
    "the standard maxwell dielectric boundary value problem in fact implements one additional approximation of replacing @xmath27 in eq .   with the susceptibility @xmath28 of bulk dielectric.@xcite this approximation",
    "is not required and any scalar susceptibility can be used in solving the boundary value problem .",
    "not surprising , the idea of an effective susceptibility or interfacial dielectric constant has been actively discussed in the literature.@xcite    some of phenomenological recipes proposed to deal with microscopic interfaces , such as the popular distance - dependent dielectric constant for solvation problems,@xcite do not withstand the scrutiny of microscopic formulations.@xcite",
    "the problem with such formulations is that spatial correlation functions describing microscopic interfacial polarization are typically highly oscillatory@xcite and do not allow defining simple distance - dependent susceptibilities .",
    "if any meaningful microscopic susceptibility has a chance to enter the standard boundary value problem , it should be consistently derived from the microscopic coulomb law in eq .   and",
    "not introduced as an _ ad hoc _ phenomenological recipe justified by fitting to experimental data or results of numerical simulations .",
    "providing such a consistent approach is the goal of this article . in other words ,",
    "the main question addressed here is what is the dielectric constant , absorbing into itself the microscopic properties of the interface , that should enter the standard dielectric boundary value problem ?",
    "we provide a general formulation of the problem , followed by specific calculations of the dielectric response of water interfacing a spherical solute .",
    "when one takes the statistical average in eq .",
    ", one arrives at @xmath34 inside the dielectric where there are no external charges .",
    "this relation translates , through gauss theorem , into the condition of continuity of the projection of @xmath35 on the unit vector @xmath36 normal to the interface .",
    "this condition can be written as@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the surface charge density determined by the normal projections of the polarization density @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) in two media in contact in the interface @xmath41    .",
    "the polarization density field @xmath23 is aligned with the radial field of a positive charge @xmath42 placed at the center of the cavity .",
    "the surface charge density @xmath38 is opposite in charge to @xmath42 to screen its interactions with charges placed outside of the cavity .",

    ", width=188 ]    in standard dielectric theories , the surface charge density @xmath38 screens the external charge .",
    "it means that if a probe charge is placed at a large distance from the interface , the effective force between the external charge @xmath42 and the probe charge is reduced by the opposite charge of the interface polarization and an effective charge @xmath44 , instead of @xmath42 , is measured by the force .",

    "the effective charge producing the measurable force on an external probe charge , @xmath48 , is then reduced by the dielectric constant of the dielectric @xmath49 .    when the constitutive relation is applied to statistically averaged fields @xmath16 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    ", @xmath51 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath52 inside the dielectric where there are no external charges .",
    "the properties of the interface enter the problem through the boundary condition in eq .  .",

    "this is the goal we are pursuing here .",
    "equation suggests that the only property of the interface one needs to supply to the solution of the laplace equation is the surface charge density or the normal projection of the polarization density .",
    "the linear response approximation@xcite provides the desired property in terms of a non - local susceptibility function @xmath53 ( generally a tensor ) depending on two coordinates in the interface@xcite @xmath54 where the integral is over the entire space and the 2-rank tensor of susceptibility is @xmath55 here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath58 in eq .   is a second rank tensor defined by the corresponding cartesian components.@xcite for some geometries of the interface , it is convenient to consider specific projections of @xmath58 .",

    "<S> we define the dielectric constant ( susceptibility ) that should enter the maxwell boundary value problem when applied to microscopic dielectric interfaces polarized by external fields . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric constant ( susceptibility ) of the interface is defined by exact linear - response equations involving correlations of statistically fluctuating interface polarization and the coulomb interaction energy of external charges with the dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to the interface between water and spherical solutes of altering size studied by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the effective dielectric constant of interfacial water is found to be significantly lower than its bulk value , and it also depends on the solute size . for tip3p water used in md simulations the interface dielectric constant changes from 9 to 4 when the effective solute radius is increased from @xmath0 to 18  . </S>"
