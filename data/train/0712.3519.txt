    "very generically , the scale - space analysis of a signal with wavelets on a given manifold defines wavelet coefficients which characterize the signal around each point of the manifold and at various scales @xcite .",
    "wavelet techniques find numerous applications in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "it commonly concerns the analysis of data distributed on the real line of time , or images on the plane . but other experiments also acquire data in all directions of the sky .",
    "this is notably the case of observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , such as the current wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite experiment , or the forthcoming planck surveyor satellite experiment .",
    "sky surveys such as the nrao very large array sky survey ( nvss ) also map data on a large fraction the celestial sphere .",
    "the scale - space analysis of such data sets requires wavelet techniques on the sphere .",
    "various wavelet formalisms have been proposed to date @xcite .",
    "the formalism originated by @xcite in a group - theoretic context triggered various developments @xcite , and was reconsidered in a more practical context by @xcite .",
    "this approach notably found a recent and very interesting application in the analysis of the cmb data , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the denoising or the deconvolution of data represents a large field of application of wavelet techniques .",
    "experimental data sets are indeed always affected by various noise sources , notably related to the instrumentation .",
    "the data can also be blurred by experimental beams associated with the instrumentation .",
    "signals detected can also originate from different physical sources , which need to be separated . in that component separation perspective , each component can in turn be technically understood as a signal , while the other components are seen as noise . as an example , observed cmb data represent a superposition of the cmb signal itself with instrumental noise and foreground emissions , blurred by the experimental beam at each detection frequency .",
    "the denoising and the deconvolution of the signal , and the separation of its astrophysical components is of major interest for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "signals with features defined at specific positions and scales typically have a sparse expansion in terms of wavelets . for such signals , denoising and deconvolution",
    "algorithms are generically much more efficient when applied to the wavelet coefficients @xcite .",
    "however this requires a scheme allowing the exact reconstruction of the signals analyzed from their wavelet coefficients",
    ". moreover , localized characteristics can be elongated , in which case directional wavelets are essential .",
    "the identification and the reconstruction of localized directional features in cmb data represents a very interesting application of such a framework .",
    "it typically concerns the imprint of topological defects such as textures or cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "this application can be recast in a component separation approach where all continuous and typically gaussian emissions are seen as noise , in contrast with localized directional features .",
    "let us also emphasize that such a framework can have many applications well beyond astrophysics , from geophysics to biomedical imaging , or computer vision .    at present , the simultaneous combination of the properties of exact reconstruction and directionality is lacking in the existing wavelet formalisms on the sphere .",
    "it has only been considered for the wavelet analysis of signals on the plane @xcite .",
    "the primary aim of the present work resides in the development of a new scale discretized wavelet formalism for the analysis and exact reconstruction of band - limited signals on the sphere with directional wavelets . as a by - product",
    ", a new continuous wavelet formalism is also obtained , which allows the analysis of signals with a new family of wavelets relative to existing formalisms .",
    "but the continuous range of scales required for the analysis prevents exact reconstruction in practice , for which the scale discretized wavelet formalism proposed is essential .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : continuous - wavelets ] , we present an existing scheme for the definition of a continuous wavelet formalism on the sphere from a generic dilation operation . we consider directional and axisymmetric wavelets and discuss the cases of the stereographic and harmonic dilations . in section [ sec : kernel - dilation ] , we propose a new kernel dilation .",
    "a corresponding family of factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support is identified .",
    "we show that localization and directionality properties of such functions can be controlled through kernel dilation . in section [ sec : scale - discretized - wavelets ] , we derive a new continuous wavelet formalism from the kernel dilation with continuous scales .",
    "we then derive a new scale discretized wavelet formalism that allows the exact reconstruction of band - limited signals in practice .",
    "we design explicitly an example wavelet .",
    "we finally recast the scale discretized wavelet formalism in an invertible filter bank approach . in section",
    "[ sec : multiresolution - algorithm ] , we describe an exact algorithm accounting for the multi - resolution properties of the formalism . the memory and computation time requirements are discussed and an implementation is tested . in section [ sec : astrophysical - application ] , we discuss the application of the formalism to the detection of cosmic strings through the denoising of full - sky cmb data .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we discuss an existing scheme for the definition of a continuous wavelet formalism on the sphere from a generic dilation operation .",
    "we consider directional and axisymmetric wavelets explicitly .",
    "we finally discuss in detail the stereographic and harmonic dilations .      in the continuous framework developed by @xcite and @xcite , the wavelet analysis of a signal on the sphere _",
    "_ , i.e. _ _ the unit sphere @xmath0 , defines wavelet coefficients through the correlation of the signal with dilated versions of a local analysis function .",

    "notice that a direct connection exists between the generic relations ( [ eq : cw7 ] ) and ( [ eq : cw8 ] ) for the signal reconstruction , and the theory of frames on the sphere @xcite .",

    "let us already notice that the reconstruction is ensured theoretically from relation ( [ eq : cw7 ] ) , through the integration on the continuous parameter @xmath95 for translations and rotations of the wavelet , and on the continuous dilation factor @xmath48 .",

    "this extension basically relies on the separation of the integration variables @xcite from relation ( [ eq : cw5 ] ) .",

    "a scheme allowing an exact reconstruction requires a discretization of the dilation factor .",
    "a scale discretized wavelet formalism is proposed in section [ sec : scale - discretized - wavelets ] , thanks to a specific choice of dilation , and through an integration of the dilation factor by slices in relation ( [ eq : cw7 ] ) .",

    "notice that the stereographic dilation operation is supported by a group structure for the composition law of the corresponding operator @xmath111 .",
    "a group homomorphism also holds with the operation of multiplication by @xmath53 on @xmath120 .    in this setting ,",
    "the effect of the dilation on the spherical harmonic coefficients of the dilated function is not easily tractable analytically .",
    "consequently , the admissibility condition ( [ eq : cw8 ] ) is difficult to check in practice .",
    "on the contrary , wavelets on the plane are well - known , and may be easily constructed , as the corresponding admissibility condition reduces to a zero mean condition for a function both integrable and square - integrable .",
    "in that context , a correspondence principle was proved @xcite , stating that the inverse stereographic projection of a wavelet on the plane leads to a wavelet on the sphere .",
    "this correspondence principle notably requires the definition of a scale integration measure identical to the measure used on the plane : @xmath121 .",
    "notice that this measure naturally appears in the original group - theoretic context @xcite .",
    "another possible definition of the dilation of functions may be considered , which is explicitly defined in harmonic space on @xmath0 .",
    "it was proposed in previous developments relative to the definition of a wavelet formalism on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the harmonic dilation is defined directly on @xmath122 through a sequence of prescriptions rather than in terms of the application of an simple operator .",
    "firstly , an arbitrary prescription must be chosen to define a set of generating functions @xmath123 of a continuous variable @xmath124 , for each @xmath15 .",
    "these functions are identified to the spherical harmonic coefficients of @xmath33 through : @xmath125 for @xmath14 , and @xmath16 .",
    "secondly , the variable @xmath126 is dilated linearly , @xmath127 , just as would be the norm of the fourier frequency on the plane . for a continuous dilation factor @xmath48",
    ", the spherical harmonic coefficients of the dilated function @xmath128 are defined by : @xmath129    in the corresponding continuous wavelet formalism , the analysis function @xmath50 must satisfy the following form of the admissibility condition ( [ eq : cw8 ] ) .",
    "on the one hand @xmath130 , which corresponds to the requirement that @xmath50 has a zero mean on the sphere : @xmath131 this zero mean is of course preserved through harmonic dilation .",
    "as the zero frequency is not supported by the wavelets , only signals with zero mean can be analyzed in this formalism ( see relation ( [ eq : cw6 ] ) ) .",
    "let us remark that wavelets on the sphere dilated through the stereographic dilation do not necessarily have a zero mean .",
    "on the other hand , the scale integration measure can arbitrarily be chosen as @xmath132 .",
    "this leads to a simple expression of the remaining constraints for @xmath133 as @xmath134 the left - hand side inequality implies @xmath135 for at least one of the first two generating functions : @xmath136 .",
    "in other words , either @xmath137 or @xmath138 must be non - zero on a set of non - zero measure on @xmath139 .",
    "the right - hand side inequality implies @xmath140 for all generating functions : @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the generating functions must satisfy @xmath141 ( this condition encompasses the zero mean condition ( [ eq : cw15 ] ) in the form @xmath142 ) and tend to zero when @xmath143 . with this choice of scale integration measure",
    ", the constraints summarize to the requirement that each generating function satisfies a condition very similar to the wavelet admissibility condition for an axisymmetric wavelet on the plane @xcite defined by a fourier transform identical to @xmath144 .",
    "consequently , the wavelet admissibility condition ( [ eq : cw16 ] ) can be checked in practice and wavelets associated with the harmonic dilation can be designed easily .    for continuous axisymmetric wavelets , a unique generating function @xmath145 of a continuous variable @xmath124",
    "is required . the admissibility condition ( [ eq : cw12 ] )",
    "reduces to the following expression .",
    "the analysis function @xmath102 must have a zero mean and only allows the analysis of signals with zero mean .",
    "a unique additional condition holds independently of @xmath17 : @xmath146 this condition actually encompasses the zero mean condition in the form @xmath147 , and also requires that the generating function must tend to zero when @xmath143 .",
    "the coefficients entering the reconstruction formula ( [ eq : cw11 ] ) read as @xmath148 , for @xmath133 .      on the one hand",
    ", the harmonic dilation lacks some of the important properties which hold under stereographic dilation . as the harmonic dilation does not act on points , the question of the corresponding properties of a radial and conformal diffeomorphism make no sense .",
    "the harmonic dilation of functions is not either a unitary procedure .",
    "it does not preserve the scalar product in @xmath31 , or specifically the norm of functions .",
    "this is due to the requirement of definition of generating functions for any function to be dilated .",
    "a group structure for the composition of harmonic dilations holds only if successive dilations of a function @xmath33 are defined through linear dilation of the variable @xmath126 of a unique generating function @xmath123 for each @xmath15 . the same condition applies for the existence of a corresponding homomorphism structure with the operation of multiplication by @xmath53 on @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , the harmonic dilation is explicitly defined in harmonic space .",
    "the evolution in real space of localization and directionality properties of functions on the sphere through harmonic dilation is therefore not known analytically . however , in the euclidean limit where a function is localized on a small portion of the sphere , this portion is assimilated to the tangent plane , and the stereographic and harmonic dilations both identify with the standard dilation in the plane . for each @xmath15 , the overall frequency index",
    "@xmath149 identifies with the continuous variable @xmath150 , corresponding to the norm of the fourier frequency on the plane @xcite .",
    "so in particular , the evolution of localization properties of functions through harmonic dilation is at least controlled in the euclidean limit .    on the other hand",
    ", the very simple action of the harmonic dilation in harmonic space also exhibits several advantages relative to the stereographic dilation .",
    "notably , the harmonic dilation ensures that the band limit of a wavelet and of the corresponding wavelet coefficients , is reduced by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "such a multi - resolution property is essential in reducing the memory and computation time requirements for the wavelet analysis of signals .",
    "it does not hold under stereographic dilation . moreover , as already emphasized , a scheme allowing an exact reconstruction of signals from their wavelet coefficients requires a discretization of the dilation factor .",
    "the definition of a scale discretized wavelet formalism through an integration of the dilation factor @xmath53 by slices in the continuous wavelet formalism turns out to be very natural with a dilation defined in harmonic space , but not with the stereographic dilation .",
    "indeed , one would like the dilation operation acting on scale discretized functions after the integration of the dilation factor by slices to be the same as the original dilation operation .",
    "it will become obvious that this property holds for a dilation defined in harmonic space , but not for the stereographic dilation .    in conclusion ,",
    "no obvious definition of dilation is imposed for the development of a wavelet formalism on the sphere . but considering our aim for a scale discretized wavelet formalism , as well as the essential criterion of defining a formalism with multi - resolution properties , we will focus on a scale discretized wavelet formalism from a dilation defined in harmonic space .",
    "however , for any dilation defined in harmonic space , the evolution of the localization and directionality properties of functions in real space through dilation needs to be understood and controlled . in that regard ,",
    "we amend the harmonic dilation ( [ eq : cw14 ] ) and define a kernel dilation to be applied on functions which are said to be factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support .",
    "moreover , the kernel dilation will also render the transition between the continuous and scale discretized formalism much simpler and more transparent than what the harmonic dilation can provide .",
    "in this section we define the kernel dilation on factorized functions in harmonic space on the sphere .",
    "we consider in particular factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support .",
    "we also study the localization and directionality properties in real space for such functions , as well as the controlled evolution of these properties through kernel dilation .",
    "a function @xmath20 can be defined to be a factorized function in harmonic space if it can be written in the form : @xmath151 for @xmath14 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the positive real _ kernel _",
    "@xmath152 is a generating function of a continuous variable @xmath124 , initially evaluated on integer values @xmath153 .",
    "the directionality coefficients @xmath154 , for @xmath14 , and @xmath16 , define the _ directional split _ of the function .",
    "in particular , for a real function @xmath33 , they bear the same symmetry relation as the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath155 themselves : @xmath156 . without loss of generality",
    "one can impose @xmath157 for the values of @xmath17 for which @xmath154 is non - zero for at least one value of @xmath158 .",
    "hence localization properties of a function @xmath33 , such as a measure of dispersion of angular distances around its central position as weighted by the function values , are governed by the kernel and to a lesser extent by the directional split .",
    "indeed , the power contained in the function @xmath33 at each allowed value of @xmath17 is fixed by the kernel only .",
    "the norm of @xmath20 reads as @xmath159 , where the sum runs over the values of @xmath17 for which @xmath154 is non - zero for at least one value of @xmath158 .",
    "however , the directional split is essential in defining the directionality properties measuring the behaviour of the function with the azimuthal variable @xmath19 , because of it bears the entire dependence of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the function in the index @xmath158 .",
    "the kernel dilation applied to a factorized function ( [ eq : kd1 ] ) is simply defined by application of the harmonic dilation ( [ eq : cw14 ] ) to the kernel only .",
    "the directionality of the dilated function is defined through the same directional split as the original function . for a continuous dilation factor @xmath48 , the dilated function therefore reads as :",
    "@xmath160 let us emphasize that the directionality coefficients @xmath154 are not affected by dilations , on the contrary of what the complete action of the harmonic dilation ( [ eq : cw14 ] ) would imply .",
    "the kernel and harmonic dilations strictly identify with one another when applied to factorized axisymmetric functions @xmath102 , for which the directional split takes the trivial values @xmath161 for @xmath14 .",
    "any function @xmath20 can be said to have a compact harmonic support in the interval @xmath162 , for any @xmath88 and any real value @xmath163 , if@xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the largest integer value below @xmath166 .",
    "notice that the compactness of the harmonic support of @xmath33 can be defined as the ratio of the band limit to the width of its support interval .    for a factorized function @xmath33 of the form ( [ eq : kd1 ] ) ,",

    "the cosmic structures originate largely from gaussian adiabatic perturbations seeded in the early phase of inflation of the universe . however , cosmological scenarios motivated in the context of theories unifying the fundamental interactions suggest the existence of topological defects resulting from phase transitions at the end of inflation .",
    "these defects would have participated to the formation of the cosmic structures . while textures are more or less axisymmetric , cosmic strings are a line - like version of defects @xcite .",
    "even though observations largely fit with an origin of the cosmic structures in terms adiabatic perturbations , room is still available for the existence of a small fraction of topological defects .",
    "moreover , fundamental string theory predicts the existence of cosmic strings in the `` brane - world '' scenario @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    ".      the standard component of the cmb signal induced by adiabatic perturbations is a gaussian signal on the sphere with a known angular power spectrum in a given cosmological model .",
    "topological defects , and in particular cosmic strings , induce a non - gaussian component of the cmb signal with characteristic features defined at specific positions and scales .",
    "the corresponding angular power spectrum exhibits a fixed characteristic shape , with a slow decay at high frequencies .",
    "the complete non - gaussian statistical distribution of a string signal and the corresponding angular power spectrum can indeed be deduced from simulations in the chosen cosmological model @xcite , up to an overall amplitude of the string contribution as set by the unknown string tension @xmath471 .",

    "we consider the perturbations of the signals around their statistical mean .",
    "instrumental gaussian white noise with zero mean also unavoidably adds as an independent component , setting the limited sensitivity of the experiment considered .",
    "we leave apart any issue of deconvolution of the experimental beam and also discard problems of contamination of cmb data by foreground emissions . in the perspective of the detection of cosmic strings , the non - gaussian component from strings represents the signal to be identified and reconstructed , while the gaussian components can be seen as a statistically independent gaussian noise .",

    "the zero mean signals @xmath49 , @xmath478 , and @xmath480 are considered to have a band limit @xmath87 , related to the resolution of the experiment under consideration , and a number @xmath395 of points @xmath398 are required for their precise description .    in first approximation we can fix the cosmological parameters at their values in the concordance cosmological model .",
    "this fixes the angular power spectra of the noise @xmath480 and of the normalized string signal @xmath478 .",
    "wavelets are by construction filters with zero mean ( see ( [ eq : sdw9 ] ) ) . as such ,",

    "their expansion in terms of wavelets is not sparse .",
    "the sparsity of the wavelet coefficients of the string signal justifies the wavelet decomposition of the data .",

    "indeed , the more similar the filter to the signal signatures , the better it magnifies these signatures .",
    "correspondingly , the detection of textures would more naturally follow from an analysis with axisymmetric wavelets ( @xmath482 ) .",
    "finally , as emphasized already , the scale discretization of the wavelets is essential for the reconstruction of the signal . in conclusion",

    "the parameters @xmath496 obviously measure the peakedness of the distributions , and relate to their kurtoses . at the analysis depths corresponding to the characteristic range of frequencies concerned by the string signal , the sparsity of the wavelet coefficients can be associated with peaked distributions @xmath497 with heavy tails ( _ i.e. _ with kurtoses larger than @xmath498 , or values @xmath499 ) relative to a gaussian distribution ( _ i.e. _ with a kurtosis equal to @xmath498 , or a value @xmath500 ) .      the identification and reconstruction of a string signal from real data",
    "can then be implemented as follows .",
    "firstly , the overall signal @xmath49 is decomposed with the chosen scale discretized steerable wavelet @xmath282 , which gives the wavelet coefficients @xmath484 through relation ( [ eq : sdw13 ] ) .    secondly , the string tension associated with a still hypothetical string signal is estimated in relation ( [ eq : aa1 ] ) . a precise approach based on the analysis of the angular power spectrum of the real data",
    "could be adopted , consisting in a likelihood analysis involving all cosmological parameters including the string tension .",
    "this standard approach was used to obtain the current constraints on the string tension @xcite , together with a reassessment of the other cosmological parameters .",
    "the distributions @xmath501 and @xmath497 should then also be reassessed according to the modified angular power spectra for @xmath480 and @xmath478 , respectively .",
    "however , in the approximation considered , all cosmological parameters are fixed at their values in the concordance cosmological model throughout the analysis .",
    "the angular power spectra of the noise @xmath480 and of the normalized string signal @xmath478 are thus kept invariant .",
    "a rough estimation of the string tension @xmath479 is obtained from a least squares method based on the variances of the wavelet coefficients of @xmath49 , @xmath478 , and @xmath480 at all depths @xmath320 .",
    "it is primarily intended to serve to the denoising itself and not as a final estimation of the string tension .",
    "the wavelet decomposition here simply helps to bin the values of the power spectra before defining the constraints . by statistical independence , the variances @xmath502 of the overall signal @xmath49 at each depth @xmath320 read , in terms of the variances @xmath495 of the normalized string signal @xmath478 and of the variances @xmath491 of the noise @xmath480 , as@xmath503 with @xmath504 .",
    "the wavelet coefficients @xmath484 are thus assumed to satisfy relation ( [ eq : aa2 ] ) for an estimation @xmath505 of the exact value @xmath506 .",
    "the statistical distributions @xmath501 for the wavelet coefficients @xmath488 of the noise @xmath480 are identified as in ( [ eq : aa3 ] ) .",
    "the statistical distributions @xmath507 for the wavelet coefficients @xmath508 of the string signal @xmath509 are as in ( [ eq : aa4 ] ) with @xmath510 and @xmath496 left invariant . by bayes theorem ,",

    "thirdly , from the identified posterior probability , the wavelet coefficients @xmath514 of the string signal are estimated to values @xmath515 , separately at each point @xmath489 for each analysis depth @xmath320 .",
    "for example , in a maximum _ a posteriori _ approach , this estimation is defined as the value which maximizes the posterior probability , while in a bayesian least square approach , it is defined as the expectation value of the posterior probability .",
    "finally , the estimated string signal @xmath516 is reconstructed from the denoised wavelet coefficients @xmath515 through relations ( [ eq : sdw15 ] ) and ( [ eq : sdw16 ] ) . the string network imprinted in the analyzed cmb data",
    "is readily mapped as the magnitude of gradient of the reconstructed signal .",
    "for the reasons discussed above , scale discretized steerable wavelets should represent a very powerful tool for the identification and the reconstruction of the string signal buried in the standard gaussian component of the cmb and in instrumental noise .",
    "the statistical approach considered for the denoising procedure at each point @xmath489 for each analysis depth @xmath320 specifically accounts for the shape of the power spectra of the string signal and of the gaussian components .",
    "it also accounts for the peakedness of the non - gaussian string signal , characterized by a large kurtosis at each analysis depth @xmath320 characteristic of the string signal .",
    "after reconstruction , a hypothesis test can be set up in order to assess if the estimated string network indeed arises from a string signal with high probability .",
    "for example , the kurtosis of the magnitude of gradient of the reconstructed signal can be compared to the corresponding reconstructed kurtosis of combinations ( [ eq : aa1 ] ) of a string signal with noise , through monte carlo analyses for various string tensions .",
    "more statistics may also be combined , such as the variances and kurtoses at different resolutions of the magnitude of gradient of the reconstructed signal , in order to provide a more robust hypothesis test .",
    "this procedure is also intended to provide an estimation of the string tension @xmath479 from the denoised signal , more precise than the original estimation @xmath505 which first served to the denoising .",
    "let us finally notice that the canny algorithm @xcite was recently proposed for the detection of cosmic strings in cmb data on planar patches @xcite .",
    "it consists of an edge detection in the map of the magnitude of gradient of the original signal , independently of any denoising approach .",
    "this method could be implemented for the analysis of full - sky cmb data , and compared to our algorithm in order to assess their relative performances . in the context of our denoising approach , this edge detection",
    "might actually be applied to the magnitude of gradient of the denoised signal , in order to count the string segments obtained , instead of computing the corresponding kurtosis . the confidence level of the detection",
    "could then be assessed by comparison with the corresponding counts for pure noise through a monte carlo analysis .",
    "we have derived a scale discretized wavelet formalism for the analysis and exact reconstruction of band - limited signals on the sphere with directional wavelets . the combination of the two properties of exact reconstruction and directionality was lacking in the existing wavelet formalisms . as for the formalism developed by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the translations of the wavelets at any point on the sphere and their proper rotations are still defined through the continuous three - dimensional rotations .",
    "but the wavelets are factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support , and they are dilated through a kernel dilation directly defined in harmonic space .    as an intermediate step ,",
    "a continuous wavelet formalism was obtained .",
    "this by - product of our developments can be understood as an alternative approach for the analysis of signals , with wavelets bearing new compact harmonic support and directionality properties .",
    "however , the continuous range of scales required for the analysis still prevents in practice the exact reconstruction of the signals analyzed from their wavelet coefficients .",
