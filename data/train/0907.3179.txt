    "one major task in the theory of dynamics is to establish some kind of dynamic irreducibility of a system . of principal interest",

    "the two main examples of this concept are robust transitivity and stable ergodicity .",
    "blenders were introduced by c. bonatti and l. daz in @xcite , to produce a large class of examples of non - hyperbolic robustly transitive diffeomorphisms .",

    "these systems are partially hyperbolic .",
    "to establish robust transitivity , they showed that the strong invariant manifolds entered a small ball ( the _ blender _ ) , where things got mixed .",
    "this blending was then distributed all over the manifold by means of the strong invariant manifolds .",
    "this phenomenon is robust , whence they get robust transitivity .    in @xcite , c. bonatti and l. daz showed that blenders appear near co - index one heterodimensional cycles .",

    "* theorem c ) , the authors showed that , surprisingly , blenders also provide a local source of stable ergodicity .",
    "this arouses some interest in the appearance of blenders in the conservative setting .",
    "indeed , the presence of blenders near pairs of periodic points of co - index one in the conservative setting , allows the authors to prove a special case of a longstanding conjecture by c. pugh and m. shub , namely that stable ergodicity is @xmath1-dense among partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with 2-dimensional center bundle @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain conservative diffeomorphisms admitting blenders near conservative diffeomorphisms with a pair of hyperbolic periodic points with co - index one .",
    "this result is crucial in the proof of the pugh - shub conjecture @xcite .",
    "let us remark that , in fact , what we need for the proof of the pugh - shub conjecture is a very special case of theorem [ main.theorem ] .",
