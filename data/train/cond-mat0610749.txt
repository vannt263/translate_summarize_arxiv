    "recent successful observation of degenerate boson - fermion mixture ( dbfm ) and fermion - fermion mixture ( dffm ) of trapped alkali - metal atoms by different experimental groups @xcite has initiated the intensive experimental studies of different novel phenomena @xcite .",
    "it has been possible to achieve a degenerate fermi gas ( dfg ) by sympathetic cooling in the presence of a second boson or fermion component , as there can not be an effective evaporative cooling @xcite of a single - component dfg due to a strong pauli - blocking repulsion at low temperature among spin - polarized fermions . among these experiments on a dfg ,",
    "apart from the study of a dbfm in @xmath0li @xcite , @xmath1na-@xmath2li @xcite and @xmath3rb-@xmath4k @xcite , there have been studies of a dffm in @xmath4k-@xmath4k@xmath5 @xcite and @xmath2li-@xmath2li@xmath5 @xcite systems , where @xmath5 denotes a distinct hyperfine state .",

    "a study of controlled collapse and explosion has been performed by donley _",
    "@xcite on an attractive @xmath6rb bec , where they manipulated the inter - atomic interaction by varying a background magnetic field exploiting a nearby feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical @xcite studies to describe different features of this experiment @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been experimental studies on collapse in a dbfm of @xmath3rb-@xmath4k by two different groups @xcite as well as related theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "as the interaction in a pure dfg at short distances is repulsive due to pauli - blocking , there can not be a collapse in it .",
    "the pauli repulsion is responsible for the stability of a neutron star against a ( gravitational ) collapse .",
    "a collapse is possible in a dbfm in the presence of a sufficiently strong boson - fermion attraction which can overcome the pauli repulsion among identical fermions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the collapse in a dffm for a sufficiently attractive interspecies fermion - fermion interaction which can overcome the pauli repulsion .",
    "however , there is already experimental evidence and theoretical conjecture that a fermi gas in two ( spin ) hyperfine states of the same atom is much more stable @xcite than expected on the basis of a scattering length approach @xcite and there is no collapse in such a system .",
    "a similar conclusion follows from an examination of the compressibility of such a system @xcite .",
    "a strongly attractive dffm in two ( spin ) hyperfine states exhibits universal behavior and should be mechanically stable as a consequence of the quantum - mechanical requirement of unitarity .",
    "this requirement limits the maximum attractive force for such a dffm to a value smaller than that of the outward fermi pressure due to pauli repulsion @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a two - component dffm in different ( spin ) hyperfine states is stable against collapse @xcite , whereas a multicomponent degenerate fermion mixture @xcite or a dffm of different atoms @xcite could undergo collapse . hence , by taking a dffm of two different fermionic atoms of different atomic mass one can avoid the problem @xcite of a possible suppression of collapse . thus one could study collapse in a dffm in the same manner as in a dbfm .",
    "the second component of fermions will then only aid in inducing an attraction among the fermions of the first component responsible for collapse without suppressing the collapse .",
    "although , the past experiment @xcite on two - component cold fermi gas used two ( spin ) hyperfine states of the same atom , experiments can be realized with distinct atoms and one can look for collapse in such a system .",
    "one such system is the @xmath2li-@xmath4k mixture : both @xmath2li @xcite and @xmath4k @xcite have been trapped and studied in laboratory .",
    "here we use a coupled time - dependent mean - field hydrodynamic model which is inspired by the success of a similar model used by the present author in the investigation of a fermionic collapse @xcite and bright @xcite and dark @xcite solitons in a dbfm as well as of mixing - demixing @xcite and black solitons @xcite in a dffm .",
    "the conclusions of the study on bright soliton @xcite are in agreement with a microscopic study @xcite and the noted survival of collapse in the numerical study @xcite has been experimentally substantiated later in a dbfm of @xmath4k-@xmath3rb @xcite .",

    "@xcite in a successful description of vortex states in a dbfm .",
    "although , a mean - field model is simple to use and leads to a proper prediction of probability density of the fermionic system , many true quantum effects are lost in this simplified model , e. g. , it can not predict the suppression of collapse of a dffm in two different ( spin ) hyperfine states @xcite as discussed in the last paragraph .",
    "we recall many true quantum effects are also lost @xcite in the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation for trapped bosons .    in our study on collapse in a dffm we shall consider a strong attraction among fermions which will naturally lead to molecule formation and not to a bcs state .",
    "a bcs state is usually formed for a weak attraction among identical fermions .",
    "the possibility of molecule formation by three - body recombination is explicitly included in our model by an absorptive nonlinear term .",
    "apart from the direct experimental interest in trapped cold atoms , a study of strongly interacting fermi gases and their possible collapse is also relevant @xcite in condensed matter physics ( superconductivity ) , nuclear physics ( nuclear matter ) , high energy physics ( effective theories of strong interaction ) , and astrophysics ( compact stellar objects ) , which makes the present study of greater interest .    the collapse in a dffm",
    "is first studied by a variational analysis of the present model , which is later substantiated by a complete numerical solution using the crank - nicholson scheme @xcite . during a collapse and an explosion of the dffm",

    "the loss of atoms is accounted for by three - body recombination involving two types of fermions .",
    "we study the sensitivity of our results on the three - body recombination loss rates .",
    "we also study the quasi - periodic oscillation of the sizes of the dffm undergoing a collapse .",
    "the collapse is to be initiated by jumping the interspecies scattering length to a large negative ( attractive ) value near a fermion - fermion feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "however , the collapse starts after a time delay upon this jump and we study the variation of this time delay with the final scattering length .",

    "the predicted collapse in a two - species bec for intra - species repulsion and interspecies attraction @xcite is similar to that in a dbfm of @xmath3rb-@xmath4k studied before @xcite and that in a dffm studied in this paper .    in section 2",
    "we present the coupled hydrodynamic model for a dffm which we apply to predict and study a collapse . in this section",
    "we also present a variational analysis based on this model which substantiates the collapse in a dffm for a sufficiently attractive interspecies fermion - fermion attraction . in section 3 we present results of numerical simulation of our study on collapse .",

    "a mean - field - hydrodynamic lagrangian for a dfg has been used successfully in the study of a dbfm @xcite which we shall use in the present investigation .",
    "the virtue of the hydrodynamic model for a dfg over a microscopic description is its simplicity and good predictive power . to develop a set of practical time - dependent hydrodynamic equations for a dffm , we consider the following lagrangian density @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of component @xmath9 , @xmath10",

    "the interaction between intra - species fermions in spin - polarized state is highly suppressed due to pauli blocking and has been neglected in ( [ yy ] ) and will be neglected throughout .",
    "the kinetic energy terms in this equation are derived from a hydrodynamic equation for the fermions @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy terms contribute little to this problem compared to the dominating pauli blocking term @xmath20 in ( [ yy ] ) .",
    "however , its inclusion leads to a smooth solution for the probability density everywhere @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density of each fermion component in ( [ yy ] ) is identical to that used in refs .",
    "the last two terms in ( [ yy ] ) correspond to three - body recombination due to the following reactions , respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a composite structure ( resonance / molecule ) of fermions @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the corresponding three - body loss rates .",

    "this domain of space was sufficient to encompass the entire fermion function during a collapse and explosion and obtain convergent solution for the total number of fermions .",
    "first we solve ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) with @xmath46 to find an initial stationary state of the dffm .",
    "it is true that the three - body loss , taken care of by terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 , is always present in the system , its effect is small leading to at best a small loss rate in atoms except for very large negative values of @xmath55 .",
    "hence , for the consideration of the initial state , we could as well neglect three - body loss .",
    "( this is why a gross - pitaevskii mean - field equation without three - body loss has been successfully used to study many features of a repulsive trapped bec @xcite . ) however , in the final state , when @xmath55 is suddenly turned to a large negative value by a feshbach resonance , the three - body loss has a dramatic effect responsible for a proper description of a collapse and explosion with a very rapid loss of atoms in a short interval of time ( see figure 3 ) .    in our numerical investigation",
    "we take @xmath56 @xmath57 m and consider the equal - mass fermions with the mass of @xmath4k corresponding to a radial frequency @xmath58 hz .",
    "the present simplified mean - field model can not predict the suppression of collapse @xcite of a dffm in two hyperfine states which is a true quantum many - body effect .",

    "the calculated frequency from figure 8 is 0.145 ms@xmath118 close to that found in the case of bosons , e.g. 0.16 ms@xmath118 .",
    "the difference could be due to the coupled nature of the hydrodynamic equations as well as the very large nonlinearity for fermions .",
    "we suggested a coupled set of time - dependent hydrodynamic equations for a trapped dffm including the effect of three - body recombination .",
    "the present time - dependent formulation permits us to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of a dffm . using a variational analysis as well as a numerical solution of our model",
    ", we study , for an attractive inter - species fermion - fermion interaction , the collapse in a dffm composed of two types of nonidentical atoms .",
    "the collapse of a dffm of two different atoms can be realized experimentally by jumping the inter - species scattering length to a large negative value by exploiting a fermion - fermion feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the collapse dynamics is strongly dependent on the three - body loss rate @xmath114 and we present results for different loss rates .",
    "we note the possibility of a revival of collapse in a dffm as in a previous simulation @xcite on a dbfm , confirmed later in an experiment @xcite on @xmath3rb-@xmath4k .",
    "we find that a revival of collapse in a dffm takes place for a moderate jump in the interspecies scattering length which disappears for a larger jump .",
    "we also study the quasi - periodic oscillation of the dffm with approximately twice the trap frequency during collapse and explosion .",
    "a proper treatment of a dffm should be performed using a fully antisymmetrized many - body slater determinant wave function @xcite as in the case of atomic and molecular scattering involving many electrons @xcite . however , in view of the success of the hydrodynamic model in a description of a collapse @xcite , the formation of bright @xcite and dark @xcite solitons , and vortex states @xcite in a dbfm , we do not believe that the present study on the collapse in a dffm to be so peculiar as to have no general validity .",
    "the present study on collapse in a dffm of nonidentical atoms can be verified in future experiments , which can really validate the present hydrodynamic model and the related numerical study .",
