    "we investigate a quantum version of zero - error source - channel coding ( communication over a noisy channel with side information ) .",
    "this includes such problems as zero - error quantum channel capacity ( with or without entanglement assistance )  @xcite , dense coding  @xcite , teleportation  @xcite , function evaluation using one - way ( classical or quantum ) communication  @xcite , and measurement of bipartite states using local operations and one - way communication ( locc-1 )  @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned all discussion is in the context of zero - error information theory  absolutely no error is allowed .",
    "the problem we consider is as follows .",
    "alice and bob each receive half of a bipartite state @xmath1 from some finite collection that has been agreed to in advance ( the _ source _ ) .",
    "alice sends a message through a noisy quantum channel , and bob must determine @xmath2 using alice s noisy message and his half of the input @xmath1 .",
    "the goal is to determine whether such a protocol is possible for a given collection of input states and a given noisy channel .",
    "one may also ask how many channel uses are needed per input state if several different input states arrive in parallel and are coded using a block code .",
    "this is known as the _ cost rate_. we also consider a variation in which the discrete index @xmath2 is replaced by a quantum register .    for classical inputs and a classical channel ,",
    "source - channel coding is possible if and only if there is a graph homomorphism between two suitably defined graphs . since the lovsz @xmath0 number of a graph is a homomorphism monotone , it provides a lower bound on the cost rate  @xcite .",
    "this bound also applies if alice and bob can make use of an entanglement resource  @xcite .",
    "we extend the notion of graph homomorphism to non - commutative graphs and show the generalized lovsz @xmath0 number of  @xcite to be monotone under these homomorphisms , providing a lower bound on cost rate for quantum source - channel coding .",
    "schrijver s @xmath3 and szegedy s @xmath4 , which are variations on lovsz s @xmath0 , are also homomorphism monotones .",
    "we generalize these for non - commutative graphs , providing stronger bounds on one - shot quantum channel capacity in particular and on quantum source - channel coding in general .",
    "although @xmath3 and @xmath4 provide only mildly stronger bounds as compared to @xmath0 for classical graphs , with non - commutative graphs the differences are often dramatic .",
    "for classical graphs @xmath3 and @xmath4 are monotone under entanglement assisted homomorphisms  @xcite , but oddly this is not the case for non - commutative graphs . as a consequence",
    ", these quantities can be used to study the power of entanglement assistance .",
    "we construct a channel with large one - shot entanglement assisted capacity but no one - shot capacity when assisted by a maximally entangled state .    in [ sec :",
    "classical ] we review graph theory and ( slightly generalized ) classical source - channel coding . in [ sec : ncgraph ] we review the theory of non - commutative graphs and define a homomorphism for these graphs . in [ sec : qsrcchan ] we build the theory of quantum source - channel coding and provide a few basic examples . in [ sec : qthmon ] we prove that @xmath0 is monotone under entanglement assisted homomorphisms of non - commutative graphs . in [ sec : repetitions ] we consider block coding and define various products on non - commutative graphs . in [ sec : schrijver ] we define schrijver @xmath3 and szegedy @xmath4 numbers for non - commutative graphs ; we then revisit some examples from the literature and also show that one - shot entanglement assisted capacity for a quantum channel can require a non - maximally entangled state .",
    "we conclude with a list of many open questions in [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "zero - error source - channel coding in a quantum context was first considered in  @xcite then in  @xcite . there",
    "the sources and channels are classical but an entanglement resource is available .",
    "zero - error entanglement assisted capacity of quantum channels was considered in  @xcite , but without sources .",
    "measurement of bipartite states using one - way classical communication was considered in  @xcite ; however , this was not in the context of source - channel coding .",
    "we consider for the first time ( in a zero - error context ) quantum sources , and consider their transmission using quantum channels . to this end we apply the concept of a non - commutative graph , first conceived in  @xcite , to characterize a quantum source .",
    "this is new , as previously only classical sources were considered so only classical graphs were needed .",
    "this gives novel perspective even for classical sources with entanglement assistance : using a non - commutative graph allows to consider the entanglement as part of the source . in  @xcite entanglement",
    "was considered separate from the source , with no framework available for investigating the type of entanglement needed .",
    "graph homomorphisms are central to classical source - channel coding  @xcite .",
    "this concept has been extended to the entanglement - assisted case but still with classical graphs  @xcite .",
    "we define graph homomorphisms for non - commutative graphs , potentially opening a path for a more developed theory .",
    "already this leads to a chromatic number for non - commutative graphs ; previously only independence number was defined  @xcite .",
    "subsequent to first submission of the present paper , an alternative definition has been provided for the chromatic number of a non - commutative graph  @xcite .",
    "the lovsz , schrijver , and szegedy numbers were known to provide bounds on classical source - channel coding  @xcite .",
    "these bounds were recently shown to hold also when entanglement assistance is allowed  @xcite .",
    "a lovsz number has been defined for non - commutative graphs , providing a bound on zero - error entanglement assisted capacity of a quantum channel  @xcite .",
    "we show this generalized lovsz number also provides a bound on quantum source - channel coding .",
    "inspired by  @xcite , we provide analogous generalizations for the schrijver and szegedy numbers .",
    "such a generalization is non - obvious as it involves a basis - independent reformulation of entrywise positivity constraints on a matrix .",
    "we show these generalized schrijver and szegedy numbers provide bounds on quantum source - channel coding , effectively providing a fully quantum generalization of  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these generalized quantities become sensitive to the nature of the entanglement resource .",
    "this leads to a counterintuitive result : a quantum channel whose one - shot zero - error capacity can only be unlocked by using a non - maximally entangled state .",
    "the existence of a classical channel with such a property is still an open question .",
    "these generalized lovsz , schrijver , and szegedy numbers are used to reproduce well known bounds on dense coding and teleportation , as well as results from  @xcite .",
    "although our techniques yield less direct proofs than those previously known , it is notable that such diverse results can be reproduced using a single technique .",
    "parallel to entanglement assisted communication runs the subfield of quantum non - locality games . in the context of entanglement assisted communication one has the entanglement assisted independence and chromatic numbers and entanglement assisted homomorphisms  @xcite . in the context of quantum non - locality one has quantum independence and chromatic numbers and quantum homomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "these concepts are mathematically similar , and indeed it is an open question whether they are identical",
    ". given this similarity , it seems feasible that the work of the present paper could have an analogue in non - locality games .",
    "this is beyond the present scope and is left as a potential direction for further research .",
    "we will make use of the following graph theory terminology .",
    "a graph @xmath5 consists of a finite set of _ vertices _ @xmath6 along with a symmetric binary relation @xmath7 ( the of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the absence of an edge is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "the subscript will be omitted when the graph can be inferred from context .",
    "we allow loops on vertices .",
    "that is to say , we allow @xmath9 for some of the @xmath10 .",
    "typically we will be dealing with graphs that do not have loops ( _ simple graphs _ ) , but allow the possibility due to the utility and insight that loops will afford .",
    "we will note the subtleties that this causes , as they arise .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the _ complement _ of @xmath5 , having vertices @xmath6 and edges @xmath12 . for graphs with loops",
    "it is also common to use as the complement the graph with edges @xmath13 .",
    "fortunately , we will only consider the complement of loop graphs that have loops on all vertices , and in this case the two definitions coincide .",
    "clique _ is a set of vertices @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "independent set _ is a clique of @xmath11 , equivalently a set @xmath14 such that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "the _ clique number _",
    "@xmath19 is the size of the largest clique , and the _ independence number _ @xmath20 is the size of the largest independent set .",
    "a _ proper coloring _ of @xmath5 is a map @xmath21 ( an assignment of _ colors _ to the vertices of @xmath5 ) such that @xmath22 whenever @xmath15 ( note that this is only possible for graphs with no loops ) .",
    "the _ chromatic number _",
    "@xmath23 is the smallest possible number of colors needed . if no proper coloring exists ( i.e.  if @xmath5 has loops ) then @xmath24 . the _ complete graph _",
    "@xmath25 has vertices @xmath26 and edges @xmath27 ( note in particular that @xmath25 does not have loops ) .",
    "@xmath5 is a _ subgraph _ of @xmath28",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "suppose alice wishes to send a message to bob through a noisy classical channel @xmath31 such that bob can decode alice s message with zero chance of error .",
    "how big of a message can be sent ? denote by @xmath32 the probability that sending @xmath33 through @xmath34 will result in bob receiving @xmath35 , and define the graph @xmath28 with vertex set @xmath36 and with edges @xmath37 two codewords @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be distinguished with certainty by bob if they are never mapped to the same @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the largest set of distinguishable codewords corresponds to the largest clique in @xmath28 , and the number of such codewords is the clique number @xmath41 .",
    "we will call @xmath28 the _ distinguishability graph _ of the channel @xmath34 .",
    "it is traditional to instead deal with the _ confusability graph _ , of which   is the complement .",
    "we choose to break with this tradition as this will lead to cleaner notation .",
    "also the distinguishability graph has the advantage of not having loops , making it more natural from a graph - theoretic perspective . in order to facilitate comparison to prior results we will sometimes speak of @xmath42 rather than @xmath41 (",
    "note that these are equal ) .",
    "if bob already has some side information regarding the message alice wishes to send , the communication task becomes easier : the number of codewords is no longer limited to @xmath41 .",
    "this situation is known as _ source - channel coding_. we will use a slightly generalized version of source - channel coding , as this will aid in the quantum generalization in [ sec : qsrcchan ] .",

    "alice sends bob a message through a noisy channel .",
    "bob uses alice s noisy message , along with his side information @xmath44 , to deduce charlie s input @xmath2 ( [ fig : coding ] ) .",
    "this reduces to standard source - channel coding if @xmath46 only when @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , the standard scenario has no charlie , @xmath43 and @xmath44 come in with probability @xmath48 , and bob is supposed to produce @xmath43 .",
    "there are a number of reasons one might wish to consider such a scenario .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath47 always .",
    "the side information @xmath44 might have originated from a previous noisy transmission of @xmath43 from alice to bob . the goal is to resend using channel @xmath49 in order to fill in the missing information . or , the communication complexity of bipartite function evaluation fits into this model .",
    "suppose that alice and bob receive @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , from a referee charlie .",
    "alice must send a message to bob such that bob may evaluate some function @xmath50 . to fit this into the model of [ fig : coding ] , imagine that charlie first chooses a value @xmath2 for @xmath51 , then sends alice and bob some @xmath52 pair such that @xmath53 . from the perspective of alice and bob ,",
    "determining @xmath2 is equivalent to evaluating @xmath50 .",
    "one may ask how many bits alice needs to send to bob to accomplish this .    in general ,",
    "alice s strategy is to encode her input @xmath43 using some function @xmath54 before sending it through the channel ( a randomized strategy never helps when zero - error is required ) . as before",
    ", bob receives a value @xmath40 with probability @xmath32 .",
    "the values @xmath44 and @xmath40 must be sufficient for bob to compute @xmath2 .",
    "for a given @xmath44 , bob knows alice s input comes from the set @xmath55 .",
    "bob only needs to distinguish between the values of @xmath43 corresponding to different @xmath2 , since his goal is to determine @xmath2 .",
    "define a graph @xmath5 with vertices @xmath56 and with edges between alice inputs that bob sometimes needs to distinguish : @xmath57 this is the _ characteristic graph _ of the source @xmath58 .",
    "if bob must sometimes distinguish @xmath43 from @xmath59 then alice s encoding must ensure that @xmath43 and @xmath59 never get mapped to the same output by the noisy channel .",
    "in other words , her encoding must satisfy @xmath60 whenever @xmath7 . by definition , this is possible precisely when @xmath5 is homomorphic to @xmath28 .",
