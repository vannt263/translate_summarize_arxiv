    "in this section we introduce the _ ab initio _ mlft method by the example of nio .",
    "we will discuss the different steps taken in order to obtain the mlft parameters .",
    "first we discuss the lda procedure used to obtain the potential , wannier functions and tight binding parameters .",
    "next we discuss the meaning of the different one electron parameters . in the last part of this section",
    "we discuss many body parameters , i.e. the slater integrals .",
    "we start our _ ab initio _ calculations with a conventional charge - selfconsistent lda calculation for the experimental crystal structure .",
    "nio has the rock - salt structure in which each ni atom is surrounded by six o atoms in cubic symmetry , and vice versa .",
    "we used the linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method@xcite as implemented in wien2k.@xcite the resulting lda band structure is shown along the symmetry lines of the face centered cubic ( fcc ) brillouin zone in fig.@xmath13[niolda ] .",
    "it is not very different from the band structure obtained and discussed forty years ago by mattheiss @xcite who used slater exchange and a non - selfconsistent potential construction .",
    "the three o @xmath16 bands extend over 5 ev , from -8.2 to -3.2 ev below the fermi level .",
    "the five ni @xmath15 bands consist of three @xmath22 bands extending from -3.0 to -0.9 ev and two @xmath23 bands extending from -1.4 to + 1.3 ev .",
    "the bottom of the ni @xmath24 band is 1.5 ev above the fermi level and at the @xmath25 point .",
    "as pointed out by mattheiss , the reason why the @xmath24 band is above the @xmath15 bands and thus empty , while it is half - full in elemental ni , is that strong hybridization with the o @xmath26 band pushes it up ( and the @xmath1 band down ) in the oxide .    within the lda ,",
    "nio is a metal , in strong contrast to experiments where nio is found to be a good insulator with a room - temperature resistance of @xmath27 cm and an optical band - gap of about 3.0 - 3.5 ev .",
    "morin54 , newman59 , powell70 this is one of the most noticeable failures of the lda .",
    "however , for the current paper , this is not a problem . although the lda can not reproduce the correct electronic structure near the nickel atom , the minimal set of localized ni @xmath11 and o @xmath9 orbitals which together span the low - energy solutions of schrdinger s equation for the lda crystal potential  exactly , i.e. the @xmath28 bands in fig.@xmath13[niolda ] , is expected to constitute a good single - particle basis set for many - body calculations .    in order to prevent double counting of the multipole part of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "we constrain the selfconsistent lda potential to be spherically symmetric inside non - overlapping muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres ( see appendices [ appcomp ] and [ appdouble ] ) , but allow it to be general in the mt - interstitial ; it is a so - called _ warped _ mt potential . for this potential",
    "we generate a basis set of 8 localized tm @xmath11 and o @xmath9 orbitals per cell which span the 8 bands exactly .",
    "since these bands do not cross any other bands in nio , this can be done by projection of the lda lapw bloch states onto wannier functions choosing band- and @xmath29-dependent phases which make the wannier functions atom - centered and localized . for an oxide like srtio@xmath3 , the tm @xmath11 and o @xmath9 bands _ do _ cross and hybridize with other bands far away from the fermi level as can be seen in fig.@xmath13[ldacompareniomnosrtio3 ] ; near avoided crossings it is therefore not clear which of the bands to project on to .",
    "moreover , one might want to go beyond perfect crystals .",
    "rather then using projection , we generate the minimal basis set of localized orbitals _ directly _ by using the @xmath2th - order muffin - tin orbital ( @xmath2mto ) method.andersen00 , andersen01 , andersen03 this method solves the problem exactly by multiple scattering theory at @xmath30 chosen energies , followed by @xmath2th - order polynomial interpolation in the hilbert space , but only for a superposition of spherically symmetric short - ranged potentials ( to leading order in the potential overlap ) .",
    "we must therefore first perform the overlapping muffin - tin approximation ( omta)@xcite to the warped mt potential , i.e. by least - squares minimization determine the radial shapes of the overlapping potential wells and the common potential zero .    the resulting basis set of five ni @xmath11 plus three o @xmath9 @xmath2mtos@xcite per cell with the @xmath31 energies , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ev , produces the eight colored , thick bands in fig.@xmath13niolda . within the width of the line they are indistinguishable from the lapw bands . hence , the @xmath2mto minimal basis set for the omta to the warped potential is a highly accurate representation of the large lapw basis set for the low - energy states , but many times more efficient .",
    "our wannier orbitals are symmetrically orthonormalized @xmath2mtos@xcite and the colors indicate the relative o @xmath9 , ni @xmath34 and ni @xmath35 wannier - orbital characters",
    ". the middle panel of fig.@xmath13[niolda ] shows the partial density of states projected onto these wannier orbitals .",
    "compared with the commonly used projection onto truncated partial - waves inside a mt sphere , our projection has the advantage of leading to well - defined occupation numbers because it is onto a complete , orthonormal basis set of localized , smooth orbitals .",
    "our projection also takes care of the o @xmath36 character which flows into the neighboring ni mt sphere due to the large size of the wannier o @xmath9 orbital . in this regard",
    ", it should be remembered that a mt sphere is _ not _ chosen to give a good representation of the charge density , and hence of the occupied wannier orbitals , but of the _",
    "potential_. since the latter has an envelope function which for rocksalt - structured nio is essentially the coulomb potential from equal , but opposite point charges on identical cubic sublattices , ni and o have _ similar sized _ mt spheres .",
    "this makes it necessary for the wave - functions resulting from a mt - based method for solving schrdinger s equation such as lapw , to carry the partial - wave expansions much further than to @xmath9 or @xmath11 , typically to @xmath37 @xmath38 , because the outer part of the o @xmath9 orbitals , for instance , are being expanded around the ni sites .",
    "nevertheless , with appropriately normalized partial waves , projection of the density of states does give similar results as with wannier @xmath39-orbitals .",
    "the eight wannier orbitals , @xmath40 , are shown on the right - hand side of fig.@xmath13[niolda ] as those surfaces where @xmath41 and which incorporate 90% of the charge , @xmath42 the red / blue color of a lobe gives its sign .",
    "as one can see , the ni @xmath11 orbitals are extremely well localized .",
    "this is a necessary condition for several many - body models which implicitly assume such an orbital basis set , for example the hubbard model which neglects all off - site coulomb correlations . in order to visualize the localization of the ni 3@xmath11 wannier orbitals at a more quantitative level , we computed the effective radial wave - functions for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 orbitals by multiplying with the corresponding spherical harmonics and averaging over all solid angles .",
    "these radial functions are compared in fig.@xmath45[niorofr ] with that of a ni atom in the @xmath46 configuration as calculated with the hartree fock method.@xcite although there are slight differences , the agreement is astonishing .",
    "the local ni @xmath11 wannier orbitals in nio are rather similar to atomic ni wave - functions .",
    "note that the atomic ni @xmath11 radial function depends on the filling of the @xmath11-shell , but is rather insensitive to the filling of the @xmath47 shell .",
    "the atomic radial function shown in fig.@xmath13[niorofr ] is calculated for a ni@xmath48 @xmath49 configuration , but would be practically the same for a ni@xmath50 @xmath51 or neutral ni @xmath52 configuration .    , for the ni @xmath44 and ni @xmath43 wannier orbitals compared with the hartree - fock radial wave function for a ni@xmath48 ion in a @xmath53 configuration . for ni@xmath50",
    "@xmath54 and ni @xmath55 the radial functions are similar .",
    "the distance to the nearest oxygen is 2.09  , which is consistent with the sum of the ionic radii of 0.72  for ni@xmath56 and 1.40  for o@xmath57 the inset shows the slater integrals eq .",
    "( [ slater ] ) for the multipole coulomb interactions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since we have chosen not to include ni @xmath14 orbitals in the minimal basis , it does not describe the high - lying , empty ni @xmath24 band which has anti - bonding o 2@xmath9 character .",
    "the corresponding ni @xmath47 bonding character of the o 2@xmath9-like band is however completely taken care of by including ( downfolding ) the ni 4@xmath14 character into the tails o 2@xmath9 wannier orbitals , as is seen in fig.@xmath13[niolda ] . in the bottom right - hand panel one can see how ni @xmath47 character is added at the tip of each lobe of the o @xmath1 orbital , such that the outermost @xmath47 radial lobe expands the tip of the @xmath1 lobe , while the remaining inner radial @xmath47 lobes of alternating sign cause the @xmath1 lobe to tail - off in an oscillating manner . the shape of the o @xmath1 wannier orbital is of course also influenced by the requirement that it be orthogonal to the ni 3@xmath11 wannier orbitals .",
    "the @xmath2mto method is particularly useful when a real - space tight - binding representation of the hamiltonian is needed.gunnarsson89 , anisimov91,anisimov97,lechermann06,zurek05,pavarini05 both the orthogonal wannier functions as well as the corresponding tight - binding representation of the hamiltonian in this basis set are directly available in the @xmath2mto formalism .",
    "details on the @xmath2mto method can be found in previous publications@xcite and appendix [ appcomp ] .",
    "here we would like to stress that the wannier orbitals used within this paper are not constructed by maximally localizing the wannier functions,@xcite but their extend is a result of symmetry constraints .",
    "this leads to orbitals that are not always maximally localized , especially in the details of the tails of these orbitals .",
    "the ni @xmath11 wannier orbitals obtained by @xmath2mto do show a very large overlap with atomic orbitals , which might well be larger than the overlap one might find between atomic orbitals and maximally localized wannier orbitals .",
    "it is the agreement between our wannier orbitals and atomic orbitals which makes the method successful .",
    "an alternative method to obtain good wannier orbitals for correlated model calculations could be to maximize the overlap of the wannier orbital with atomic orbitals .",
    "although only the ni @xmath58 bands in fig.@xmath13[niolda ] are partly occupied , inclusion of o @xmath9 orbitals in the basis is important for describing spectroscopy . in photoemission , for example , the removal of a tm @xmath59 electron can lead to a transfer of charge from the o to the tm atom .",
    "this dynamical screening would not be captured on a basis of only tm @xmath58 orbitals .",
    "_ crystal _ field theory ( mcft ) , i.e. local calculations using a basis of only tm @xmath58 orbitals , which have antibonding o @xmath9 tails fixed to them , can be useful in many other cases , for example for calculating magnetic anisotropies . in this paper , however , we concentrate on multiplet _ ligand _ field theory ( mlft ) and explicitly include the o @xmath9 orbitals in the basis set .        until now , we have considered the infinite crystal and have calculated the one - electron potential in the local - density and warped muffin - tin approximations . for that potential",
    "we have derived a set of localized o @xmath9 and ni @xmath11 wannier orbitals which exactly describe the o @xmath60 and ni @xmath58 bands , as well as the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we now use these orbitals and this hamiltonian for the nio@xmath61 cluster ( fig.@xmath13[nio6cluster ] ) .",
    "the band structure thereby reduces to the o @xmath9 like @xmath62- and @xmath63-levels and the ni @xmath11 like @xmath64- and @xmath65-levels shown in the central part of the left - hand panel of fig.@xmath13nioclusterwanierorbitalenergy , plus some o @xmath9 levels which do not couple to the ni @xmath11 levels and are therefore not shown in the figure . for comparison",
    ", we repeat from fig.@xmath13[niolda ] the crystalline density of states projected onto the o @xmath66 ni @xmath67 and @xmath68 orbitals . in the following",
    "we discuss the formation of these simple cluster levels before we consider calculating many - electron multiplets .    the nmto ni @xmath11 wannier orbitals have the on - site energies @xmath691.55 and @xmath70ev with respect to the fermi level . had the potential been spherically symmetric within the range of the ni @xmath11 orbitals , the @xmath44 and @xmath43 radial functions in fig.@xmath13niorofr would have been identical , and their levels degenerate with energy @xmath711.35 ev . the crystal - field splitting , @xmath72ev , is basically due to the fact that @xmath44 and @xmath43 orbitals point respectively towards and between the nearest oxygen neighbors , which are negatively charged .",
    "( the notation @xmath73 for @xmath74 is standard in mlft.@xcite ) in the conventional ionic picture , 2 electrons are transferred from each neutral ni @xmath75 atom to each o atom , where they complete the @xmath1 shell .",
    "hence , the crystal - field splitting would be the radial matrix element of the non - spherical part of the electrostatic madelung potential @xmath76\\right ] $ ] from these @xmath77 charges . however , with the atomic radial function shown in fig .",
    "[ niorofr ] , which yields : @xmath78 , the splitting is merely @xmath79ev , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath80ev too small , and this is even an overestimate because the charge transfer from the @xmath24 to the @xmath81 band is reduced by covalency . note in passing , that had we taken the anisotropy of the electrostatic potential to be the one caused by the lda charge density and the protons outside the ni mt sphere , we would have gotten merely 0.01ev .",
    "this is so because the ni mt radius of 1.10  is larger than the ni@xmath48 ionic radius of 0.72  and thus cuts off part of the oxygen charge density ( remember : mt spheres are designed to describe the potential and not the charge density ) .",
    "hence , the anisotropy felt by the different _ angular _ behaviors of the @xmath44 and @xmath43 orbitals can at most only account for half the calculated crystal - field splitting .",
    "next , we now turn to the different _ radial _ behaviors ( fig.@xmath13[niorofr ] )",
    ". these are mostly due to the requirement that the ni @xmath44 and @xmath43 wannier orbitals be orthogonal to the nearest o @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath44 radial function changes sign for increasing @xmath82 , while the @xmath43 radial function merely decays . at short distances ( @xmath83  ) ,",
    "the normalized @xmath44 radial function is therefore larger than the normalized @xmath43 function .",
    "since the maxima of the two radial functions occur where the radial potential , @xmath84 is huge and negative , the higher @xmath44 maximum causes a lower potential energy , opposite to what is needed to explain the size of the crystal - field splitting . in the end , it turns out that the @xmath850.5 ev crystal - field splitting is a result of not only the potential acting on the different angular and radial wave - functions , but also due to the _ kinetic _ energy .",
    "the @xmath44 orbitals overlap more with the o @xmath9 orbitals than the @xmath43 orbitals , whereby orthogonalization increases the kinetic energy more for the former than for the latter . for the calculation of the mlft parameters it turns out to be important to treat all these interactions on an equal footing .",
    "we now continue our explanation of the orbital energy level diagram in fig .",
    "[ nioclusterwanierorbitalenergy ] , this time starting from on - site energy @xmath86 ev of the o @xmath1 wannier orbitals marked on the right - hand side .",
    "the ionic energy is thus @xmath87 ev . since we have chosen not to include ni @xmath47 orbitals in the basis set , the bonding ni @xmath14 character has been downfolded into the o @xmath88 orbitals so that the @xmath89 ev includes a downwards shift of about @xmath90 ev from ni @xmath14 covalency .",
    "the nio@xmath61 cluster contains @xmath91 o @xmath9 orbitals , but not all linear combinations can interact with @xmath11 orbitals on the central ni site .",
    "hence , the basis set for the mlft calculations can be greatly reduced by including only those linear combinations which do couple , the so - called ligand ( @xmath92 ) orbitals.@xcite the reduction of the hilbert space by use of ligand orbitals is crucial for efficient mlft calculations which is explained in more detail in appendix [ appbasissize ] . for each tm",
    "@xmath11 orbital there is exactly one such linear combination .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ nioclusterwanierorbitalenergy ] shows the 5 ni @xmath11 orbitals together with the 5 ni - centered @xmath92 orbitals of the same symmetry .",
    "there is an important difference between the @xmath92 @xmath43 and @xmath92 @xmath44 orbitals : whereas the @xmath92 @xmath43 orbitals are bonding ( same color ) between nearest o @xmath9 wannier orbitals , and thus give rise to a substantial o - o @xmath63-like bond charge , the @xmath92 @xmath44 orbitals are anti - bonding ( different color ) . as a result ,",
    "the energies of the @xmath92 @xmath43 and @xmath44 orbitals are respectively @xmath93 below and above @xmath94.ghijsen88,eskes90    we finally complete the level diagram by including the covalent hopping integrals @xmath95 and @xmath96andersen78 between the @xmath92 @xmath9 and tm @xmath11 orbitals of respectively @xmath43 and @xmath44 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath43 hopping gives rise to an @xmath92 @xmath9-like @xmath97 and a tm @xmath11-like @xmath64 level , and the @xmath44 hopping gives rise to an @xmath92 @xmath9-like @xmath63 and a tm @xmath11-like @xmath65 level .",
    "it is these @xmath64 and @xmath65 levels which in the solid broaden into ni @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "the @xmath98 level is close to the fermi level in the lda and this indicates that the @xmath65 orbital is half full .",
    "the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath99 orbitals have considerably lower energies and are fully occupied .",
    "our mlft calculations include coulomb correlations beyond the one - electron mean - field potentials discussed so - far , but only among the tm @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "arguments for treating the @xmath92 @xmath9 orbitals as well as their coulomb repulsion with the tm @xmath11 orbitals at the lda level , are that the @xmath92 @xmath9 orbitals are fairly delocalized and that they are almost fully occupied . as an example , we can safely neglect correlation in an event where two holes meet on a single oxygen atom and scatter .",
    "the coulomb correlations are responsible for the multiplet structure , and we keep them among the ni @xmath11 orbitals , but make a distinction between the spherical ( @xmath5 , @xmath100 ) and the non - spherical repulsions .    the spherical part of the coulomb repulsion , often parametrized by @xmath5 , is strongly screened in a solid . if a ni @xmath11 electron is removed , there will be a charge - flow into the ni @xmath47 orbital , for example , which reduces the energy cost of such an excitation .",
    "although several calculations of the screened @xmath5 have been presented in the past,@xcite we fit @xmath5 such as to obtain the best agreement between our mlft calculation and the experimental multiplet spectra.@xcite the parameter @xmath100 is the orbitally averaged ( spherical ) part of the difference between the on - site energies of the ni @xmath11 orbitals and the @xmath92 @xmath9 orbitals at a filling of @xmath101 electrons in the ni @xmath11 shell . in the lda , as well as for the ground - state found in our mlft calculations , the ni @xmath11 occupation exceeds @xmath101 due to the covalency with the oxygens . the relation between @xmath102 , as defined in mlft calculations , and @xmath103 as obtained from the lda , is rather non - trivial and we shall therefore treat , not only @xmath5 , but also @xmath102 as an adjustable parameter . in the foreseeable future",
    ", it should be possible to calculate @xmath5 and @xmath100 from first principles .",
    "the non - spherical parts of the coulomb interactions we can easily calculate because the multipole interactions between two @xmath11 electrons are hardly screened . for example , the coulomb repulsion between two @xmath8 electrons is obviously larger than that between a @xmath8 electron and a @xmath104 electron , but to screen this difference requires electrons with high angular momentum around the ni site ; a ni @xmath47 electron , for instance , could _ not _ do it .",
    "also electrons on neighboring sites are inefficient in screening the multipole because it decays fast ( @xmath105 it has been shown that neglecting any screening of the multipole part of the coulomb interaction gives reasonable agreement between theory and experiment.@xcite also in the present work , we shall neglect any screening of the multipole part of the coulomb interaction and shall find reasonable agreement with experiments .",
    "multipole interactions are the cause of the hunds - rule energy .",
    "for example , two @xmath8 electrons must have different spins , whereas two electrons in different @xmath11 orbitals , and hence less repulsive , may be in a spin - triplet state , as well as in the spin - singlet state .",
    "experimentally it has been shown @xcite that the multipole interactions of the coulomb interaction , are reasonably well approximated by assuming that the @xmath106 orbitals have the pure - angular - momentum form : @xmath107 .",
    "the inset in fig.@xmath13[niorofr ] is a table of the values of the slater integrals obtained using the ni@xmath48 ionic radial function , @xmath108 , as well as the radial functions obtained by averaging the ni @xmath43 and @xmath44 wannier orbitals over solid angles .",

    "the hunds - rule exchange can either be defined as : @xmath116 or as : @xmath117 .",
    "the bare @xmath118 as calculated from the wannier orbitals is of the order of @xmath425 ev .",
    "this is clearly much too large because the monopole part of the coulomb repulsion is strongly screened .",
    "the values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 are respectively @xmath121 and @xmath122 ev , in good agreement with experimental values , as we shall see .",
    "the multiplet interactions are quite large and lead to a multiplet splitting of the ni-@xmath123 configuration of about 7.5 ev , which is the energy difference between the @xmath124 ground - state configuration and the highest excited singlet of @xmath125 character .",
    "this is larger than the ni-@xmath58 bandwidth and therefore _ not _ a small energy .",
    "we will compare our results to several experiments , including core level spectroscopy .",
    "once a core hole is made , the interaction between the core and valence electrons becomes important . here",
    "again we will make a distinction between the multi- and monopole interactions .",

    "i.e. _ the slater integrals @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 we again assume that screening can be neglected , which allows us to directly calculate these integrals from the core and valence wannier orbitals .",
    "the core wannier orbitals are equivalent to atomic wave functions since they have no inter - site overlap .",
    "it is important to use a scalar - relativistic method for the calculation , as well as to calculate the core wave - functions for the final state occupations , which requires an open shell calculation .",

    "@xmath2mtos , even when bands described by the set are crossed by and hybridizes with other bands , provided that we can choose the @xmath158 expansion energies outside the range of those other bands . for srtio@xmath155",
    "we used @xmath159 and @xmath160 ev .",
    "the @xmath0 wannier orbitals for the three oxides are very similar ; they merely contract along the @xmath0 row of the periodic table .",
    "this is seen when going from the bottom to the top in the right - hand panel of fig.@xmath13ldacompareniomnosrtio3 , and even more clearly in fig.@xmath13niomnosrtio3rofr where we show the angular - averaged @xmath43 wannier orbitals .",
    "the well - known reason for this orbital contraction is as follows : upon proceeding one step along the tm row , a proton and an electron are added .",
    "the electron incompletely screens the attractive potential from the proton seen by another valence electron , and as a result , the one - electron potential becomes deeper and deeper upon proceeding along the series , until the @xmath11 shell is full and the screening is complete . since this mechanism is atomic , the shapes of our @xmath0 wannier functions are fairly robust and the chemistry merely changes tails and thereby normalizations a bit .",
    "this is what we saw in fig.@xmath13[niorofr ] .",
    "for that reason , the contraction seen in fig.@xmath13[niomnosrtio3rofr ] of the @xmath43 radial functions which are less influenced by o than the @xmath44 functions closely follows that of the 2 + ionic radii , which are 0.72 ( ni@xmath48 ) , 0.80 ( mn@xmath48 ) , and 0.90  ( ti@xmath48 ) , in the sense that at the respective radius , all three radial functions have about the same amplitude .",
    "this happens although the wannier orbitals are calculated for the real solids , which in the case of srtio@xmath3 have a ti - o distance far smaller than expected from the size of the ti @xmath43 function in fig.@xmath13[niomnosrtio3rofr ] . that the chemical binding of srtio@xmath3 is different than those of nio and mno also becomes clear by adding the accepted ionic radius of o@xmath148 ( 1.40  ) to the tm@xmath48 radii given above , obtaining : 2.12 , 2.20 , and 2.30  for the tm - o distance in respectively nio , mno , and srtio@xmath20 the real distances in nio and mno are nearly the same , but much smaller ( 1.95  ) in srtio@xmath20    the short ti - o distance is of course reproduced by using the ti@xmath147 radius of 0.68   which corresponds to the band - structure configuration sr@xmath161ti@xmath162(o@xmath148)@xmath163 sr@xmath164  ti@xmath165(o@xmath166)@xmath20 this ionic picture of the binding seems to neglect the ti - o and sr - o covalencies predicted by the lda , _",
    "i.e. _ the fact that there is a considerable amount of ti-@xmath0 and sr-@xmath156 partial - wave character in the o @xmath16 bands .",
    "but this is only apparently so : the ti @xmath0 and sr @xmath156 radial functions are essentially exponentially increasing because they solve the respective radial schrdinger equation for o @xmath16-band energies , which are way below those of the ti @xmath15 and sr @xmath167 bands .",
    "hence , these partial waves simply complete the shape of the o @xmath16 wannier orbitals inside the ti and sr mt spheres .",
    "in order to test the quality of mlft calculations using the lda wannier orbitals , we now present a comparison between theory and experiment for several established spectroscopies , which show tm excitons .",
    "such locally bound states are represented well within the small cluster used in the mlft .",
    "the materials considered , namely , nio , mno and srtio@xmath3 , are insulators , thus justifying the theoretical methodology further .",
    "nio , mno and srtio@xmath3 have local ground states which are well understood , and the spectra shown here have already been explained in the literature .",
    "new in the present paper is that the mlft parameters ( except for @xmath5 and @xmath100 ) are not fitted to the experiment , but calculated _ ab initio_.    in the following subsections we first discuss x - ray absorption ( xas ) at the @xmath168 edge , which probes tm @xmath1 to @xmath0 excitations .",
    "next we show tm @xmath1 core - level x - ray photoemission ( xps ) experiments on an impurity system .",
    "both @xmath1 xas and @xmath1 xps excite the same core states and the difference is that in x - ray absorption the electron is excited into the local @xmath0-shell whereas photoemission excites the core electron into vacuum states .",
    "the resulting spectra are very different .",
    "we then continue with core excitations measured with inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", inelastic x - ray scattering of core to valence excitations and x - ray absorption of core to valence excitations is very similar .",
    "the initial and final states probed are the same .",
    "the difference is that whereas x - ray absorption is mainly caused by dipole transitions , inelastic x - ray diffraction is caused by multipole transitions determined by the length of the transferred momentum .",
    "finally in the last subsection , we show inelastic x - ray scattering of @xmath11-@xmath11 excitations in nio .",
    "these spectra are particularly instructive as they allow for a relative straight - forward understanding on how the different interactions contribute to each multiplet excitation . for pedagogical reasons we provide a brief introduction to each of the experimental techniques .",
    "a more thoroughly description of these techniques can be found in textbooks , e.g. those by de groot and kotani , @xcite sthr@xcite , and schlke.@xcite       ( @xmath170 edge ) core - level x - ray absorption spectra for srtio@xmath3 , mno , and nio .",

    "the excitation energy is in the x - ray range and varies from @xmath171 ev for ti to @xmath172 ev for ni .",
    "the excitations are dipole allowed , which make them so intense that spectra with very little noise can be obtained .",
    "the spectra split into two set of peaks , the @xmath173 and @xmath174 edges , due to spin - orbit coupling in the tm @xmath1 core hole .",

    "the splitting within an @xmath174 or @xmath173 edge is due to the combined interaction of covalent ligand - field effects and coulomb interactions between the @xmath0 electrons and between the @xmath1 core hole and the @xmath0 electrons .",

    "the spectral line - shape is governed by multiplet effects leading to involved spectral functions , not obviously related to the density of states.@xcite the spectra are therefore generally used as fingerprints which contain unique features resembling the local ground - state properties .",
    "the energy of the final state is determined by local atomic - like physics .",
    "the intensity with which each state can be reached depends , via the optical selection rules , on the ground - state symmetry and the polarization of the light .",
    "this can lead to large spectral changes for small changes in the ground-state.fink85 , groot90 , groot08 for example , a @xmath9 electron can only be excited into an @xmath8 orbital with @xmath191 or @xmath192 polarized light , but not with @xmath193 polarized light .",
    "changing the orbital occupation can therefore lead to a strong polarization dependence which for certain multiplets can be as strong as 100%.@xcite due to the strong tm @xmath1 spin - orbit coupling the xas spectra are also sensitive to the spin of the ground-state.thole85 , goedkoop88    theoretically , as well as experimentally , one finds that the monopole part of the @xmath1-@xmath0 coulomb interaction is larger than that of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction .",

    "looking at nio , mno and srtio@xmath144 one may notice that our calculations reproduce the low - energy parts of the spectra better than the high - energy parts .",
    "the former are most excitonic and therefore best described by the small basis set in the cluster .",
    "it may furthermore be noticed that not only the edge - jumps are absent in the calculation , but also the interference between the excitonic excitations of the @xmath174 edge and the continuum states of the @xmath173 edge .",
    "these interference effects give rise to fano like line - shapes present in the experiment , but not in the theory .",
    "the effect is relative small as the interference between @xmath180 and @xmath177 states is forbidden in many channels .",
    "there is , however , a substantial mixing of core - states due to coulomb interactions , which could be the main reason for the interference effects between continuum and excitonic states of the @xmath173 and @xmath174 edge .    nevertheless , the agreement between mlft and experiment is rather good in fig.@xmath13[expl23xas ] for all three tm oxides .",

    "for xas at the tm @xmath204 edge , the leading interaction is of dipole character , i.e. one can use the long wave - length limit . for ixs , the transferred momentum can be selected by looking at different scattering angles and energies : for small momentum transfers , dipole transitions are measured and for larger momentum transfers , octupole transitions.@xcite in fig.@xmath13[expmnom23ixs ] we show the non - resonant ixs at the @xmath204 edge in mno for high magnitude momentum transfers where octupole transitions are the strongest .",

    "in such a set of zeroth - order @xmath275 mtos , each of the orbitals is a solution of schrdinger s differential equation for the overlapping mt potential for the chosen energy , but has _ kinks _ at all ni and o ( but not _ e.g. _",
    "sr ) hard spheres.@xcite those hard spheres are chosen to be a bit smaller than touching and not to coincide with a node of the radial wave - function .",
    "the ni @xmath276 0mto , for instance , is now defined by the hard - sphere boundary condition that all its @xmath9-projections on all o spheres and all its @xmath11-projections on all ni spheres , _ except _",

    "this hard - sphere boundary condition is what localizes the 0mtos , unless there are wave - functions at the chosen energy with main characters different from those of the 0mtos in the basis .",
    "the condition that each 0mto solves schrdinger s equation , except for kinks in the ni @xmath11 and o @xmath9 channels , means that each 0mto is smooth in all _ other _ channels .",

    "nevertheless , as seen in fig.@xmath13[niolda ] , our ni @xmath11 plus o @xmath9 wannier orbitals are as localized as can be expected , and in fact much better than wannier orbitals derived from a large set of energy-__in__dependent orbitals.@xcite",
    "dft in the lda already contains a large part of the local coulomb interactions .",
    "these interactions are included once more in the mlft calculations . for mlft based on the lda potential and wannier orbitals one should therefore take care not to double count such interactions .",
    "we differentiate rigidly between the monopole and the multipole parts of all coulomb interactions .",
    "this idea is based on the experimental observation that the monopole part of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath5 ) is largely screened , from @xmath279 ev to @xmath280 ev in nio for example .",
    "the multiplet splitting , determined by the multipole part of the coulomb interaction is , however , only slightly reduced from the splitting one expects based on atomic values .",

    "the monopole part of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath5 ) as well as the spherical part of the on - site energy ( @xmath100 ) we fit to the experiment and double - counting for the spherical part is therefore not an issue . in order to prevent double counting of the multipole part of the coulomb repulsion ,",
    "the lda calculations are done with a warped lda potential ; _ i.e. _ within the mt sphere only the spherical part of the potential is included . in order to check",
    "how this influences the lda band - structure we compare in fig.@xmath13[niosrtio3ldafullwarped ] the band - structures of nio ( top ) and srtio@xmath3 ( bottom ) calculated with the full lda potential ( thick ) and warped mt potential ( thin ) .",
    "concentrating first on the nio bands , we see that both calculations agree within basically the line - width for all bands and @xmath29-vectors , except for the @xmath22 bands .",
    "those bands are shifted downwards in the warped - mt calculations by a momentum independent value of about 220 mev .",
    "this effect nicely illustrates the problem of double counting .",
    "the orbital occupation of the ni @xmath0 orbitals within lda is such that the @xmath43 orbitals are fully occupied and the @xmath281 orbitals are half filled .",
    "the local charge density is thus cubic .",
    "the coulomb repulsion between two @xmath43 orbitals is on average larger than between a @xmath43 and @xmath44 orbital .",
    "this effect is well included in the lda functional and related to the fact that the overlap of for example the density of the @xmath276 and @xmath282 orbitals is larger than the overlap of the density of the @xmath276 and @xmath104 orbitals . in mlft calculations ,",
    "such interactions are included in the slater integrals . a mlft calculation based on the full lda potential",
    "would thus double count the multipolar interaction between the fully occupied @xmath43 and the half filled @xmath44 shell .",
    "one option would be to include the full potential within the lda calculations and then subtract the non - spherical part of the coulomb repulsion , as included in the lda functional , between the wannier functions for which a full multiplet interaction is included in the mlft calculations . in that case one",
    "should carefully analyze the occupation of each wannier function in order to determine the potential that has to be subtracted .",
    "we opted to not include the non - spherical interactions in the first place .",
    "this does mean that one also neglects the non - spherical part of the non - local madelung potential in the self - consistent lda calculations . in order to correct for this",
    ", we calculate this potential from the self - consistent lda charge density and added it afterwards .",
    "we found that the coulomb potential which is double counted generally exceeds the non - spherical non - local potential by an order of magnitude .",
    "our choice of not including the non - spherical interactions in the first place and treating the non - local non - spherical interactions as a correction after self - consistency has been reached thus provides an accurate self - consistent solution to the potential needed in mlft .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that doing a full - potential calculation and subsequently subtracting the non - spherical part of the local coulomb interaction according to the lda functional will give very similar results .    in the bottom panel of fig.@xmath13[niosrtio3ldafullwarped ]",
    "we compare the band - structures of srtio@xmath3 calculated for the warped and full potentials .",
    "first of all , there is no clear shift of the @xmath43 bands with respect to the @xmath44 bands , presumably because ti atom has a @xmath283 configuration .",
    "but there are changes in the o @xmath9-derived bands . in nio both the ni and",
    "the o atoms have cubic point symmetry , but in srtio@xmath3 the o environment is tetragonal as was mentioned above .",
    "for srtio@xmath3 one can see a larger difference between the full and warped - potential calculations than for nio .",
    "the interpretation for srtio@xmath3 is less straight forward because several effects come together . due to ti - o covalency",
    "there is some non - spherical , predominantly @xmath44-derived charge on the ti atom from the o @xmath1 band .",
    "the local non - spherical potential due to this charge should not be included when doing mlft calculations .",
    "there is however also a non - cubic potential at the o site that shifts the o bands .",
    "this potential should be included when doing the mlft calculations .",
    "note that the latter potential is not included in the self - consistent warped - potential calculations , but we add it later , before doing the mlft calculations .",
    "embedded cluster calculations , like mlft or dmft , contain a few correlated orbitals coupled to a large set of uncorrelated orbitals . within such calculations",
    "the size of the hilbert space can be reduced enormously by creating appropriate linear combinations of the uncorrelated orbitals . within our examples",
    "these are the o @xmath9 orbitals , which are combined to ligand orbitals . without introducing ligand orbitals for a tmo@xmath284 cluster",
    ", there would be @xmath285 spin orbitals in the one - electron basis . with a filling of @xmath286 electrons for the nio@xmath61 @xmath123-cluster , this results in @xmath287 states in the many - electron basis .",
    "for the tio@xmath61 @xmath145-cluster representing srtio@xmath144 the filling would be @xmath28836 and thus result in @xmath289 states in the many - electron basis .",
    "the introduction of @xmath92 orbitals , however , reduces the number of one - electron basis functions to 20 , whereby the many - electron hilbert space reduces to @xmath290 for a @xmath138 and to @xmath291 states for a @xmath194 configuration .",
    "this reduction in the number of many - electron basis functions by factors of respectively @xmath292 and @xmath293 leads to a crucial gain of computational convenience .",
    "either basis set _ can _ be used to calculate ground - state properties and spectral functions because the matrices are sparse .",
    "but diagonalization of a matrix with dimension @xmath294 requires large computational resources whereas diagonalization and evaluation of spectral functions of a sparse matrix with dimension @xmath295 can be done using standard libraries on modern desktop computers .",
    "one may obtain a further reduction in the number of stored basis states by including only those which are important for representing the actual wave - function .",
    "( see appendix [ appdiag ] for details ) .",
    "ligand orbitals are normally obtained by symmetry considerations.@xcite the rotation properties of the tm @xmath11 orbitals should be the same as the linear combination of the o @xmath9 orbitals with which this orbital makes a covalent bond .",
    "these symmetry considerations can be extended to a simple mathematical procedure , valid in all point group symmetries . from dft",

    "the basis of the central tm @xmath11 orbitals is not changed . in cubic symmetry the tridiagonalization results in a transformed hamiltonian whereby each tm @xmath11 orbital couples to one ligand orbital . for lower symmetries each @xmath11 orbital couples to maximal 5 ligand orbitals .",
    "the ligand orbitals can couple to an other set of ligand orbitals , _",
    "ad infinitum_. covalence in a tridiagonal representation tends to converge fast , justifying the inclusion of only a single ligand shell in mlft .",
    "the introduction of ligand orbitals is not restricted to fully occupied shells , like the o @xmath60 shell .",
    "for example for srtio@xmath3 one could include besides the o @xmath9 ligand orbitals also the sr @xmath11 ligand orbitals .",
    "care has to be taken how for such a system the ligand orbitals are defined .",
    "if one creates a single ligand shell for both the o @xmath9 and sr @xmath11 orbitals by blocktridiagonalization as described in the previous paragraph one would obtain ligand orbitals that are always partially occupied .",
    "this results in a very large many particle basis set and is unpractical .",
    "in such a case it is better to first diagonalize the non - interacting hamiltonian describing the interactions between the ligand orbitals .",
    "based on the onsite energies one then creates two different ligand shells , one for the occupied , or valence orbitals and one for the unoccupied or conduction orbitals .",
    "@xcite    note that a similar procedure can be used for dmft calculations using a lanczos impurity solver .",
    "doing so enhances the calculation speed and allows one to increase the number of bath sites ( number of discretization sites used to represent the anderson impurity model used in dmft ) leading to much more continues spectral functions .",
    "the mlft ground - state and spectral calculations are done using a lanczos algorithm.@xcite the calculations start with a random vector ( @xmath296 ) in the basis of the @xmath297 and @xmath298 configurations , whereby @xmath299 is the number of @xmath58 electrons ( 0 for ti , 5 for mn and 8 for ni ) and @xmath300 represents a single hole in the ligand shell .",
    "although this starting point is slightly worse than the dft single slater determinant ground - state , which prescribes a specific mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath92 states , it does contain the correct symmetry states .",
    "thereby convergence is so fast that the starting point really does not matter that much .",
    "given a negative definite hamiltonian , the wave - function @xmath301 has a larger overlap with the ground - state wave function than the wave - function @xmath296 . by repeatedly acting with the hamiltonian on the random starting function and normalizing the wave - function in - between ( @xmath302 ) , one converges to the ground - state .",
    "this procedure can be speeded up considerably by creating a tri - diagonal matrix of the hamiltonian in the basis of @xmath303 , with the additional constrained that @xmath304 is orthogonal to @xmath305 .",
    "the tri - diagonal matrix in the so called krylov basis can be diagonalized with the use of dense matrix methods .",
    "having found the ground - state within the basis of the @xmath297 plus @xmath298 configurations , we remove the basis functions not needed to represent the ground - state wave function from the basis and extend the basis set by acting with the hamiltonian on the wave - function .",

    "<S> cluster calculations including the full coulomb vertex can be done in the basis of the localized wannier orbitals which describe the low - energy density functional ( lda ) band structure of the infinite crystal , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ the transition metal @xmath0 and oxygen @xmath1 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial extend of our @xmath0 wannier orbitals ( orthonormalized @xmath2th order muffin - tin orbitals ) is close to that found for atomic hartree - fock orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we define ligand orbitals as those linear combinations of the o @xmath1 wannier orbitals which couple to the @xmath0 orbitals for the chosen cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the use of ligand orbitals allows for a minimal hilbert space in multiplet ligand - field theory calculations , thus reducing the computational costs substantially . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a fast and simple _ ab initio _ theory , which can provide useful information about local properties of correlated insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we compare results for nio , mno and srtio@xmath3 with x - ray absorption , inelastic x - ray scattering , and photoemission experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplet ligand field theory parameters found by our _ ab initio _ method agree within @xmath410% to known experimental values .    </S>",
    "<S> [ nio6cluster ]         many electronic properties of solids can now be described _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ thanks to the advent of powerful computers and the development of ingenious methods , such as density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite with local density ( lda)@xcite or generalized gradient ( gga)@xcite approximations , lda+hubbard @xmath5 ( lda+u),@xcite quantum chemical methods,@xcite dynamic mean - field theory , metzner89,georges92,jarrell92,georges96,anisimov97 , held03 , maier05 , lechermann06 quantum monte - carlo simulations,@xcite and exact diagonalization for finite clusters.@xcite nevertheless , for correlated open - shell systems with several local orbital and spin degrees of freedom , electronic - structure calculations remain a challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> ground - state properties and spectral functions may be calculated by exact diagonalization of the many - electron hamiltonian , but this is hindered by the exponential growth of the hilbert - space with the number of correlated electrons in the system . exploiting symmetry and limiting </S>",
    "<S> the number of correlated electronic degrees of freedom may enable the treatment of relatively large clusters , as done in the important case of doped high-@xmath6 cuprates , where symmetry in the spin sector allowed lau and coworkers to use clusters with up to 32 cuo@xmath7 plackets , each with a single cu @xmath8 , and two o @xmath9 orbitals.@xcite for _ local _ properties , such as excitonic spectra , exact diagonalization for finite clusters becomes much more appealing , as relatively small clusters often suffice . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic anisotropies , @xmath10-tensors , magnetization - dependent electron - spin resonance spectra , crystal - field excitations , and a manifold of excitonic core - level spectra are usually well described using very small clusters . for transition - metal and rare - earth compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the cluster may often be limited to merely a single @xmath11- or @xmath12-electron cation surrounded by its nearest neighbor ligands as illustrated in fig.@xmath13[nio6cluster ] . for clusters that small , exact diagonalization is equivalent to multiplet ligand - field - theory ( mlft ) , one of the earliest quantum - chemistry methods developed to describe the electronic structure of transition - metal and rare - earth compounds.@xcite mlft is a highly cost - efficient method , able to account for many of the local properties and excitonic spectra of correlated materials .    </S>",
    "<S> mlft calculations traditionally use parameters fitted to experiments . despite being a great help for understanding and interpreting experimental results </S>",
    "<S> , this approach is however not completely satisfactory and , over the years , numerous theoretical studies have therefore been devoted to obtaining mlft parameters _ ab initio_.@xcite sugano and shulman @xcite calculated the ligand - field parameters by constructing single - particle molecular orbitals ( mos ) as linear combinations of atomic hartree - fock orbitals and thereby in several cases obtained qualitative agreement with experiments . more often , mo theory with a more complete basis is used.@xcite after the lda had proven useful not only for @xmath14- and @xmath9- , but also for @xmath11- and @xmath12- electrons in solids , andersen70 several authors obtained mlft parameters by performing an lda calculation for the cluster and using its kohn - sham mos . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite such a calculation breaks the translation invariance of the crystal already at the single - particle lda level , and it is necessary to remedy finite - size and surface effects , e.g. by embedding the cluster in a set of point - charges mimicking the rest of the solid . </S>",
    "<S> such procedures are not well controlled , e.g. depending on the details , the sign of crystal - field may change.sugano63 , wachters71 , wachters72    here we use a different route to performing _ ab initio _ mlft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure is similar to the method originally devised by gunnarsson _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for obtaining the parameters in the anderson impurity model and , in the last 15 years , used extensively for dynamical - mean - field calculations for realistic solids ( lda+dmft ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we start our _ ab initio _ mlft calculation by performing a dft calculation for the proper , infinite crystal using a modern dft code which employs an accurate density functional and basis set ( e.g. lapws).andersen75,blaha90 from the ( selfconsistent ) dft crystal potential we then calculate _ a set of wannier functions _ suitable as single - particle basis for the mlft calculation.@xcite since the members of such a set are centered either on the tm or ligand atoms , we shall call them wannier _ orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> _ typically , they are the tm @xmath0- and oxygen @xmath1-orbitals which , _ taken together _ </S>",
    "<S> , exactly describe the dft @xmath15- and @xmath16 bands . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the set should be minimal and span _ exactly _ all dft solutions in the energy range relevant for the property to be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that this set contains sufficiently many ligand orbitals to make the _ correlated _ tm _ orbitals well localized , _ _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the tm @xmath11-orbitals should not have tails on any other atom . </S>",
    "<S> this localization allows one to restrict the many - electron calculations of local properties to a single tm site plus its ligand neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the current method , there are no embedding errors , except those arising from truncating the single - particle basis to include only the wannier orbitals on the cluster .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the method by the example of the late transition - metal oxide nio with configuration @xmath17 . in sect . </S>",
    "<S> ii , we show that similar results can be obtained for middle and early transition - metal oxides , specifically @xmath18 mno and @xmath19 srtio@xmath20    in sect . </S>",
    "<S> iii , we compare with results obtained by several different experimental techniques : ( a ) @xmath1 x - ray absorption ( xas ) , a charge neutral excitation of a transition - metal @xmath1 core electron into the @xmath0 shell . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath1 core level x - ray photoemission ( xps ) from ni impurities in mgo . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) of core to valence excitations , a technique similar to xas . </S>",
    "<S> we specifically show @xmath21 core - electron excitations into the @xmath0 shell . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) inelastic x - ray scattering of @xmath11-@xmath11 excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments presented for these materials are relatively well understood , so that the comparison with our new _ ab initio _ results constitute a critical test of the theoretical method . at the end of the paper , we conclude . in appendix [ appcovalence ] </S>",
    "<S> we provide information on the different basis sets or wannier orbitals used , as well as the meaning of the different occupation numbers and the concept of formal valence . </S>",
    "<S> details of the calculations , including numerical values of several mlft parameters obtained _ ab initio , _ may be found in appendix [ appcomp ] . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the double counting of interactions in the lda and mlft calculations may be found in appendix [ appdouble ] . in appendix [ appbasissize ] </S>",
    "<S> we show how ligand orbitals can be obtained in general symmetry from the o @xmath1 orbitals , with the use of blocktridiagonalization of the orbital basis set . </S>",
    "<S> this is an essential ingredient which makes these calculation numerically efficient . </S>",
    "<S> appendix [ appdiag ] contains a short note on the exact diagonalization routines . </S>"
