    "direct searches for the new leptons ( @xmath2 ) and quarks ( @xmath3 ) led to the following lower bounds on their masses [ 1 ] : @xmath4 gev ; @xmath5 gev ( dirac type ) and @xmath6 gev ( majorana type ) for stable neutrinos ; @xmath7 gev ( dirac type ) and @xmath8 gev ( majorana type ) for unstable neutrinos ; @xmath9 gev ( neutral current decays ) , @xmath10 gev ( charged current decays ) .",

    "before the spontaneous symmetry breaking , all quarks are massless and there are no differences between @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 , etc . in other words , fermions with the same quantum numbers are indistinguishable .",
    "this leads us to the first assumption [ 2 , 3 ] :    * yukawa couplings are equal within each type of fermion families    @xmath32    the first assumption results in @xmath33 massless particles and one massive particle with @xmath34 for each type of fermion @xmath35 .",
    "if there is only one higgs doublet which gives dirac masses to all four types of fermions ( @xmath36 , it seems natural to make the second assumption [ 6 , 8 ] :    * yukawa couplings for different types of fermions should be nearly equal    @xmath37    considering the mass values of the third sm generation @xmath38 the second assumption leads to the statement that according to the flavor democracy , the fourth sm family should exist . in terms of the mass matrix , the above arguments mean @xmath39 which leads to @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the mass basis .",

    "it is interesting to note that with the preferable value of @xmath46 the flavor democracy predicts the mass of the fourth generation to be @xmath47 gev .",
    "the masses of the first three families of fermions , as well as observable inter - family mixings , are generated due to the small deviations from the full flavor democracy [ 7 , 11 , 12 ] .",
