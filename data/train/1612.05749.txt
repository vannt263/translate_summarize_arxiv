    "one of the main problems in systems biology is revealing the relationship between functions and components ( proteins , nucleic acids , polysaccharides ) as well as their interactions in biological networks @xcite . with the contribution of experimental physiologists , the precise details of components , interactions , and full map of the biological regulatory network",
    "have been presented . to analyze the function of the network ,",
    "many mathematical methods have been introduced , such as master equations model , the monte carlo method @xcite , the stochastic model @xcite , ordinary differential equation ( ode ) model @xcite , and the boolean network method @xcite .",
    "these mathematical models not only help us understand how the biological components work , but also provide many useful and precise predictions @xcite .",
    "an important application of the mathematical models is to investigate how the biological network is robustly designed for realizing its function .",
    "creatures should be well adapted to the environment after the long process of evolution .",
    "sometimes , the adaptability is expressed as the high robustness of the function and structure against perturbations @xcite .",
    "one of the well - studied examples is the research on the cell - cycle network that describes the metabolic process @xcite .",
    "li _ et al . _ have investigated the global dynamical property and stability of the cell - cycle network of budding yeast in the boolean network model @xcite and the ode model @xcite , and revealed that the cell - cycle pathway is an attracting trajectory of the dynamics and rather stable against perturbations .",
    "they have also studied the robustness of the network in the stochastic model from the potential landscape perspective @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have also carried out many works from the potential landscape perspective in the study of the cell - cycle network using the stochastic model and the ode model @xcite .",
    "their results have demonstrated that the network has the least dissipation cost design for its robustness . these studies that use various models help us",
    "understand the biological network s robustness further .",
    "the biological network is robustly designed as a whole , but the functional role of local edges would be diverse .",
    "several works of wang _ et al .",
    "_ , on the basis of the boolean network model , have revealed that the functional backbone motif structures of the cell - cycle network of budding and fission yeast , where the functional backbone motif is the minimal subnetwork ( with the fewest edges ) that can maintain the main function of the full network @xcite .",
    "afterward , yang _ et al . _ constructed a simple cell - cycle network of cancer cells and found that the backbone motif structure also exists in this network @xcite .",
    "from this perspective , a biological network can be viewed as the combination of two components : the functional backbone motif ( backbone network ) , which carries out the main function of the network ; and the remaining edges ( supplementary edges ) , which can enhance the robustness of the network",
    ". this classification could not only help us understand why a network still works normally after some regulatory edges are removed , but also provide us considerable information to control the network or even design a new artificial network in further experiments .",
    "therefore , finding the backbone network is a very important task .    the method used by wang _",
    "et al . _ is rather good in finding the backbone network , but it has some limitations .",
    "the method is process based : firstly , the boolean network equations can be established and simplified with the known biological process ; then , the simplified equations are solved by enumeration , and all the solutions are called the possible networks of the biological process ; and finally , the backbone network is selected from the possible networks with the known biological network .",
    "however , this method can be applied only to the boolean network model , and is not adaptable to the other models previously mentioned .",
    "moreover , the process of solving equations by enumeration may cost considerable time in many situations .",
    "therefore , just as in the case of studies on the robustness of the cell - cycle network , an efficient method that can be applied to determine the backbone network in different models is considered to be very necessary .    in this paper ,",
    "we suggest a new method to determine the backbone network of the biological network based on the idea of tinkering .",
    "the idea of tinkering was firstly used in evolution by franois jacob , who considered the process of evolution as a tinker s tinkering @xcite .",
    "then , alon _ et al .",
    "_ proposed that the tinker is a good engineer for some biological networks motifs , which are well designed to enhance the network robustness@xcite . here ,",
    "based on the idea of tinkering , we propose a simple algorithm , the tinker algorithm , with which the backbone network of a given network can be determined by tinkering the edges of the network one by one .",
    "we apply it to different models such as the boolean network model , stochastic model , and ode method .",
    "simulation results show that the algorithm works satisfactorily .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the description of the tinker algorithm is provided . in sec .",
    "iii , the simulation results of the tinker algorithm applied in the boolean network model , stochastic model , and ode method are presented in detail .",
    "finally , our conclusion and discussions are given .",
    "a biological network with @xmath0 interacting molecules can be expressed as an adjacency matrix @xmath1 , where each node denotes a molecule .",
    "the value of @xmath2 @xmath3 can be positive , negative , or zero , depending on whether node @xmath4 activates , inhibits , or does not interact with node @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath6 can also be positive , negative , or zero , representing that node @xmath5 has self - degradation , self - stimulation , or no action back on itself , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath7 to denote the concentration or state of the @xmath5th molecule at the moment @xmath8 , where @xmath9 for all the molecules . here , the function of a network is expressed as a special time series of @xmath10 , say @xmath11 ; we call it the functional sequences . to determine the backbone network , two basic assumptions are necessary",
    ": the full network and functional sequences should be known from experiments or database in advance ; and every node is indispensable in maintaining the function of the network , and can not be removed .",
    "the basic idea of the tinker algorithm is to identify the functional role by tinkering each edge .",
    "we check whether the functional sequences are still maintained under the remaining network after removing an edge .",
    "if this is true , this edge is a supplementary edge and can be removed ; otherwise , the edge is a backbone edge , and should be retained . for discrete models , such as the boolean network model and the stochastic model , the function",
    "being maintained means that the new time series ( after an edge is removed ) is completely in accordance with the functional sequences , namely , @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , each node s functional sequence is influenced only by its neighbors .",
    "therefore , we can construct a local network for each node : the target node and its entry regulations .",
    "in addition , there must be a minimal subnetwork of the local network under which the functional sequence of the node is maintained , and we call it the subbackbone network . then , the backbone network of the full network can be viewed as the combination of subbackbone networks of all nodes . the schematic showing how to determine the subbackbone network of each node is in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the full network ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) , we arbitrarily select a node and construct its local network ( fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "then , we check its subnetworks in the order of the subnetwork containing @xmath13 edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ) to identify which subnetwork is the subbackbone network . with this idea , the code of the tinker algorithm can be written as follows :     * // the c pseudo - code of the tinker algorithm +   + tinker(@xmath14 , @xmath15)\\ { //",

    "for each case of @xmath26 and @xmath28 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we update the network and use the subroutine @xmath38 to check whether the functional sequences can be maintained under the new network .",
    "this process will cost most time in running the program since the number of cases that we have to check is @xmath39 actually , the program may stop in the middle of the loop ( if the check is true ) ; thus , less than @xmath40 cases are needed to be considered in practical conditions .",
    "moreover , for a network with degree distribution @xmath41 , we consider @xmath42 cases at most .",
    "since @xmath43 , the computational time in which we determine the backbone network of a network with @xmath0 nodes is less than the order of @xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 is the largest degree of the nodes .",
    "we also compare the efficiency of the tinker algorithm with that of the algorithm in the previous reference . to find all the possible networks of the functional sequences ,",
    "most of the time for the algorithm used in reference @xcite is spent in solving the boolean network equations by enumerating the types of regulation between any two nodes . because the types of regulation can be activation , inhibition , or no regulation ,",
    "the time needed to solve the equations ( not simplified ) is of the order of @xmath46 .",
    "if the equations are simplified , the time would be less .",
    "for the tinker algorithm , the running time of finding the backbone network is determined by @xmath47 . for many biological networks ,",
    "the average degree of each network is approximately between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 usually @xcite .",
    "obviously , @xmath51 is much smaller than @xmath46 , indicating that the tinker algorithm is more efficient .",
    "the tinker algorithm is more efficient mostly because it makes full use of the given network .",
    "once the full network is given , in order to identify the functional role of an edge , only two cases ( keeping or removing the edge ) are needed to be checked . on the other hand , for the algorithm in reference @xcite ,",
    "the full network is not required at first . to identify the type of regulation between any two nodes , three cases ( activation , inhibition , or no regulation )",
    "should be checked .",
    "this leads to the computational complexity of @xmath51 versus @xmath46 for the tinker algorithm and the previous algorithm .",
    "however , we can do nothing with the tinker algorithm if the full network is not given in advance .",
    "therefore , it should be noted that the tinker algorithm is preferred only for the task of finding the backbone network of a given full network . we will focus our attention on this task in the following sections .",
    "in this paper , we take the cell - cycle networks as our examples @xcite .",
    "the full process of the cell cycle consists of four phases : g@xmath52 , s , g@xmath48 , and m. in the g@xmath52 phase , the cell grows , and undergoes division under appropriate conditions .",
    "then , in the s phase , dna is synthesized and chromosomes are replicated . the g@xmath48 phase is a  gap \" phase between s and m. the final phase m corresponds to mitosis , in which chromosomes are separated and the cell is divided into two .",
