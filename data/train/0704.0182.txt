    "the recent interest in the magnetic coupling between antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials is motivated by the quest for fundamental insight into the phenomenon of exchange bias.@xcite this effect , the discovery of which dates back to the 1950s,@xcite manifests itself in a shift of the magnetization curve along the field axis . nowadays",
    "the exchange bias effect is employed in a variety of devices , such as sensors or hard disk read heads , based on magnetic thin films.@xcite    only few methods can be used to study the spin structure of ultrathin antiferromagnetic films .",
    "while neutron diffraction and mssbauer spectroscopy have been successfully employed to explore the spin structures of many bulk antiferromagnets already decades ago , both methods suffer from a lack of signal if films of a few atomic layers are to be investigated .",
    "x - ray magnetic linear dichroism ( xmld ) in the soft x - ray absorption , on the other hand , is a method with sub - monolayer sensitivity .",
    "xmld refers to the difference between x - ray absorption spectra for the plane of x - ray polarization aligned parallel and perpendicular to the atomic moments.@xcite by symmetry the xmld signal does not depend on the orientation of magnetic moments but only on their axial alignment , and is thus suitable for the investigation of ferromagnetic as well as collinear antiferromagnetic spin structures , antiferromagnetic thin films in particular .",
    "linear dichroic signal is also encountered in case of structural , not magnetic , reduction of the symmetry , as is commonly the case in the direction along the film normal due to the presence of interfaces.@xcite this can be eliminated if measurements are compared in which only the direction of the spin axis is varied , while the lattice geometry is fixed . in the following",
    "we will use the acronym `` xmld '' for this situation only .    unlike x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) , which in @xmath1 metallic systems essentially measures integral quantities , namely the spin and orbital magnetic moments , the size and shape of xmld depend also on the details of the electronic structure .",
    "although integral sum rules have been put forward for xmld,@xcite which relate the integral over the xmld signal to the magneto - crystalline - anisotropy energy , this integral is usually much smaller than the amplitude of the plus  minus feature in the xmld spectrum .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that the latter may vary significantly with the crystallographic orientation of the magnetic moments.@xcite this is what we call the magneto - crystalline anisotropy of xmld .",
    "in this paper we study the magneto - crystalline anisotropy of xmld of a thin co layer .",
    "we use the af  fm coupling between the femn and co layers to manipulate the orientation of the co moments , namely the observation that co moments in a co / femn bilayer align along @xmath2 directions when in contact with a magnetically disordered ( paramagnetic ) femn layer ( above its nel temperature ) , while they prefer @xmath3 directions when the femn layer magnetically orders ( antiferromagnetic).@xcite we take advantage of the fact that the nel temperature depends on the thickness of the femn layer.@xcite growing wedge - shaped samples we are thus able to study both @xmath2- and @xmath3-oriented domains at the same time .",
    "we use a photoelectron emission microscope ( peem ) , as described in refs .   for the microscopic laterally resolved detection of the x - ray absorption cross section of the femn / co bilayers . in combination with x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) in the soft x - ray absorption as a magnetic contrast mechanism",
    ", peem is routinely used for the element - resolved observation of magnetic domain patterns in multilayered structures.@xcite xmld can equally serve as the magnetic contrast mechanism for peem if linearly polarized x - rays are used . here , a combined xmcd and xmld spectromicroscopic investigation of single - crystalline femn / co bilayers on cu(001 ) is presented .",
    "we find that the xmld signal of the fm co layer exhibits a strikingly different behavior when in contact with a paramagnetic and an antiferromagnetically ordered femn layer , while the xmcd contrast does not differ appreciably .",
    "we compare our observations to _ ab initio _ calculations of the @xmath0 xmld in bulk fcc co for different crystallographic orientations of the magnetic moments .",
    "investigation of the influence of spin and electronic structure on the xmld requires single - crystalline samples with well characterized af  fm interfaces . because of the small lattice mismatch ( 0.4%),@xcite fe@xmath4mn@xmath4 films ( femn in the following ) on a cu(001 ) single crystal are ideal candidates for such investigations .",
    "epitaxial , virtually unstrained femn films can be grown in a layer - by - layer mode by thermal deposition on cu(001 ) at room temperature.@xcite this provides an opportunity to study the magnetic properties of an af / fm system in single crystalline femn / co and co / femn bilayers on cu(001).@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy revealed atomically smooth interfaces with islands or vacancies of single atomic height.@xcite based on xmcd - peem investigations of fm / femn / fm trilayers and on xmld spectroscopy experiments of co / femn bilayers , we concluded previously that a non - collinear three - dimensional spin structure is present in the ultrathin femn layers , possibly similar to the so - called @xmath5 spin structure present in bulk femn.@xcite combination of the kerr magnetometry and xmcd - peem imaging showed that the magnetic coupling across the interface is mediated by step edges of single atom height , while atomically flat areas do not contribute.@xcite",
    "all experiments were performed _ in - situ _ in an ultrahigh vacuum system with a base pressure below @xmath6 pa .",
    "the disk - shaped cu(001 ) single crystal was cleaned by cycles of 1 kev argon ion bombardment at 300 k and subsequent annealing at 873 k for 15 minutes .",
    "the surface exhibited a sharp @xmath7 low energy electron diffraction pattern .",
    "no contaminations were detectable by auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) .",
    "the films were grown by thermal evaporation on the clean substrate at room temperature in zero external magnetic field .",
    "fe and co were evaporated by electron bombardment of high purity wires ( 99.99% purity ) of 2 mm diameter , while a rod ( 99.5% purity ) of 4 mm diameter was used for mn .",
    "fe@xmath8mn@xmath9 films of equiatomic composition ( @xmath10 ) were obtained by simultaneous evaporation of fe and mn from two different sources . during the deposition the pressure in the chamber",
    "was kept below @xmath11 pa .",
    "a typical evaporation rate was 1 ml per minute .",
    "the composition of the femn films was estimated from the evaporation rates of the two sources , determined by medium energy electron diffraction ( meed ) , and cross - checked by auger electron spectroscopy peak ratios .",
    "no indication of segregation of cu into or on top of the femn layers was found .",
    "the thickness of the films was determined by meed , which shows pronounced layer - by - layer oscillations.@xcite the femn layer was grown in the form of small wedges of 200 @xmath12 m width , using the method described in ref .  .",
    "the experiments were performed at the ue56/2-pgm1 helical undulator beamline of the berlin synchrotron radiation facility bessy , which can be set to deliver circularly polarized radiation of either helicity with a degree of circular polarization of about 80% , or linear vertical or horizontal polarization of @xmath13.@xcite the set - up of the electrostatic peem was identical to that described in refs ..",
    "the light was incident at an angle of @xmath14 with respect to the sample surface .",
    "rotation of the sample about the surface normal allowed to take images for different x - ray azimuthal angles of incidence .",
    "parameters were set to a lateral resolution of 350 nm , and a field of view of 60 @xmath12 m .",
    "the xmcd images represent a grayscale - coded absorption asymmetry for opposite helicities of the circularly polarized x - rays at the @xmath0 absorption maximum ( 777.5 ev ) , @xmath15 i.e. , the difference of absorption images acquired with opposite helicities divided by their sum . for the quantitative analysis ,",
    "background images acquired at lower photon energy ( 5 ev below the @xmath0 maximum ) were subtracted .",
    "for xmld , the maximum contrast was determined from a series of images acquired with 0.2 ev photon energy step around the maximum of the co @xmath0 absorption peak of a 6 ml co / cu(001 ) film , using @xmath16-polarized light .",
    "maximum contrast was found between images taken at photon energies @xmath17 ev and @xmath18 ev . since the acquisition time necessary to observe xmld contrast at the fe @xmath0 edge in femn / co / cu(001 ) bilayers was of the order of hours , no such photon energy sweeps were undertaken for the fe @xmath0 edge ( maximum at 707.5 ev ) ; instead , the same relative photon energies as determined for the co @xmath0 edge were tentatively used ( @xmath19 ev and @xmath20 ev ) .",
    "images at the two photon energies were taken using @xmath21 and @xmath16 polarized x - rays . because of the @xmath22 incidence , xmld from in - plane magnetization is larger by a factor of @xmath23 for @xmath21 polarized excitation .",
    "taking into account the opposite sign of the effect for the two polarizations we used the following formula for the xmld contrast @xmath24.\\ ] ] the images thus reproduce quantitatively the difference between images taken at the higher photon energy minus images taken at the lower photon energy for @xmath21 polarized x - rays , divided by the sum of these images .",

    "crystallographic orientation of the cu substrate and azimuthal angle of incidence are shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",

    "[ elements ] ]    this section is divided into three parts .",
    "first , we demonstrate the performance of the spectromicroscopic domain imaging and present the contrast obtained on the @xmath0 edges of co , fe and mn .",
    "next , we study the dependence of the xmcd and xmld contrast at the co @xmath0 edge on the azimuthal angle of incidence .",
    "finally , we discuss the quantitative difference between the xmld signal obtained from @xmath25 and @xmath26 domains .    in fig .",
    "[ elements ] typical xmcd and xmld images obtained at the @xmath0 edge of co are shown together with those obtained at the @xmath0 edges of fe and mn . a wedge - shaped femn/12 ml co bilayer was used . the co xmcd image ( a ) shows micron - sized magnetic domains . while the domain magnetization lies along @xmath27 directions in the upper half of the image , only domains with magnetization along @xmath26",
    "can be seen the lower half .",
    "this behavior was observed previously,@xcite and is related to the fact that for less than about 10 ml femn thickness is paramagnetic at room temperature , while thicker femn layers develop af order.@xcite    identical domain patterns with strongly reduced xmcd contrast are observed at the fe ( c ) and mn ( e ) @xmath0 edges .",
    "the contrast arises due to the induced moments in the femn layer.@xcite the mn image is a negative of the fe and co images , indicative of an antiparallel orientation of the mn moments with respect to the magnetization direction of the fm co layer .",
    "images of the same spot obtained with xmld as magnetic contrast mechanism are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ elements ] .",
    "the magnetic domain pattern is clearly visible at the co @xmath0 edge ( b ) .",
    "note that domains with opposite magnetization direction can not be distinguished by xmld ( compare the right lower parts of images ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the xmld contrast at the fe @xmath0 edge is much weaker than at the co @xmath0 edge . only after averaging over images with about 170 minutes total acquisition time",
    "we were able to recognize at least the magnetic domains in the top part of the image .",
    "the images of fig .  [ elements ] are presented on quite different grayscale ranges : while the full contrast from saturated white to saturated black in the co xmcd image ( a ) is 20% , it is amplified to 8% for the fe ( c ) and 1.5% for mn ( e ) xmcd images , and amounts to 3% in the co xmld image ( b ) , and only 0.7% in the fe xmld image ( d ) .",
    "our previously published xmld spectra,@xcite in which the xmld signal at the fe @xmath0 edge is below the noise level , supported a non - collinear antiferromagnetic arrangement of fe spins in the af femn layer . in this case",
    "only the small induced ferromagnetic moment in the femn layer , the xmcd signal of which corresponds to about 30% of the fe atoms in the interface atomic layer,@xcite leads to an xmld signal .",
    "although xmld has been successfully applied in the past to image antiferromagnetic domains in peem,@xcite no attempt was made on metallic antiferromagnets , and it is commonly believed that the reduced crystal field splitting of the electronic states in metals@xcite is prohibiting the use of xmld for magnetic imaging .",
    "[ elements ] ( d ) , however , shows that it is possible to image the xmld signal , even of the comparably low number of the induced moments , by peem .",
    "quantitative estimates support the interpretation of the contrast observed in fig .",
    "[ elements ] ( d ) : in the top part of the image , the fe xmld is about a factor of 6 weaker than the co xmld at the same position .",
    "this is about the same ratio as between the respective xmcd contrasts in panels ( a ) and ( c ) at about 6 ml femn thickness .",
    "this size of induced ferromagnetic alignment is consistent with our earlier investigation of femn / co bilayers.@xcite furthermore , the fe xmld originating from induced moments at the interface decreases with increasing total femn thickness , so that the expected fe xmld signal would be within the noise of the measurement of the spectra of ref .   , which were taken for a 15 ml femn film .",

    "panels ( a ) through ( g ) show images obtained for different azimuthal angles of incidence , indicated by an arrow at the right hand side of each panel .",

    "the azimuth angle was read from a dial at the sample holder with an accuracy of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 corresponds to the nominal [ 010 ] direction of the cu substrate ; however , as will be outlined below , the angular dependence of the magnetic contrast indicates that the real [ 010 ] direction was at @xmath30 azimuth angle .",
    "this deviation from the nominal direction is within the accuracy with which the substrate could be oriented upon mounting to the sample holder .",
    "the data have been taken in the sequence from ( a ) to ( g ) .",
    "typical acquisition times were 4 minutes per helicity for the circular polarization , and 20 minutes per polarization direction and photon energy for the linear polarization . including the necessary sample manipulations , the time to obtain the data of fig .",
    "[ angles ] totalled 28 hours .",
    "the time evolution of the domain pattern is clearly visible in the ( a)(g ) series from the shift of the transition line between paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic femn towards higher thicknesses .",

    "the lines correspond to a sine fit .",
    "the fit reveals a @xmath30 phase shift , which can be attributed to the inaccuracy of the sample mounting .",
    "the angular dependence of the xmcd contrast of the individual domains confirms very nicely the assignment of magnetization directions in fig .",
    "[ angles ] . a small vertical offset may be attributed to instrumental asymmetries , as for example different intensities of the two helicities .",
    "importantly , the amplitude of the xmcd contrast is only about 5% lower in panel ( b ) than in panel ( a ) .",

    "such a large effect of magnetization direction on any physical quantity is rather unusual in @xmath1 metals , which exhibit only a weak spin  orbit coupling . in order to prove that we see a genuine magneto - crystalline anisotropy we next discuss the role of spin non - collinearity and make comparison to other experimental data and theoretical calculations .",

    "the data of ref .   have been shifted in energy by @xmath48 ev for overlap of the absorption curves in ( a ) .",
    "[ mld_exp ] ]    besides changing the easy axis direction in the co layer , magnetic ordering of the femn may also induce a small non - collinearity of the co moments .",
    "such a non - collinear fanning out of the fm moments in fe / mnf@xmath49 bilayers as a consequence of the af ",
    "fm coupling was recently suggested on the basis of mssbauer spectroscopy.@xcite we consider now if a similar scenario can explain our xmld data .",
    "a distribution of the co spins around a mean direction would lead to a reduction of both the xmcd and xmld signals compared to the fully aligned case . while the reduction of the xmcd signal is proportional to the reduction of the net moment , xmld , due to its different angular dependence , is more sensitive and depends also on the distribution of the fanning angles . in the extreme case of moments oriented at @xmath31 with respect to the net magnetization , the xmld",
    "would be reduced to zero , while the xmcd would still be at 71% of its maximum value . using the reduction factor of 0.95 of the net magnetization , obtained from xmcd contrast , and assuming both binary ( moments point at a fixed angle on either side of the net magnetization ) and normal distributions ( gaussian distribution of angles ) of the fanning angle we arrive at a reduction factor of about 0.81 for the xmld contrast . therefore fanning of the co moments due to the interaction with the femn layer ,",

    "[ mld_exp ] .",
    "both spectra had been measured under similar conditions.@xcite note that the peak - to - peak ratio of the xmld spectra of fig .",

    "[ lin_angle ] , the ratio of peak - to - peak xmld of 2.3 between the two curves obtained from fig .",

    "the major contribution to xmld comes from the exchange splitting of the @xmath54 levels ( @xmath55 ev).@xcite the magneto - crystalline anisotropy then arises from the fact that different final @xmath1 states are probed for different orientations of the sample magnetization .    to assess the feasibility of our experimental data",

    "is found , however , the [ 100 ] exhibits larger xmld magnitude contrary to the experiment . before dismissing these results as a disagreement a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , the calculations were done on bulk material while the experiment is performed on a thin layer sandwiched by other materials , therefore a good quantitative agreement is unlikely .",
    "second , we can not judge the calculated anisotropy based on the present data only .",
    "note that due to a slight mutual shift of the calculated spectra , the [ 100 ] contrast at the maximum amplitude of the [ 110 ] xmld would be rather small .",
    "such a shift is not present in fig .",
    "[ mld_exp ] , where [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] spectra obtained on slightly different samples are compared .",
    "third , a possible non - collinearity of co spins due to the presence of the af femn layer would lead to local moments pointing neither along [ 110 ] nor fully along [ 100 ] . taking these uncertainties into account we draw a modest , nevertheless non - trivial , conclusion that the theory does not prohibit a magneto - crystalline anisotropy of xmld as large as observed in our experiment .",
    "we have presented a spectromicroscopic peem investigation of the magnetic domain pattern on co / femn bilayers using xmcd and xmld as the contrast mechanism .",
    "the sensitivity of the method allows to visualize even the tiny xmld signal of the induced ferromagnetic moments in the femn layer .",
    "we have found a factor of 3.6 difference in the xmld contrast between the co @xmath0 signal from @xmath25 and @xmath56 domains in a _",

    "we argue that this huge difference is mainly due to an intrinsic magneto - crystalline anisotropy of xmld of the co layer .",
