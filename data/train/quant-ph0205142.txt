    "quantum cryptography key distribution ( qckd ) is at the moment the most advanced and challenging application of quantum information .",
    "qckd offers the possibility that two remote parties , sender and receiver ( conventionally called alice and bob ) , can exchange a secret random key , called sifted key ( string of qubits ) , to implement a secure encryption / decryption algorithm based on a shared secret key , without the need that the two parties meet .    in practical qckd ,",
    "alice and bob use a quantum channel , along which sequences of signals are either sent or measured at random between different bases of orthogonal quantum states .",
    "alice can play the role of either setting randomly the polarization basis of photons and sending them to bob ( faint laser pulses as photon source ) , or measuring photons randomly in any one of the selected bases ( entangled photon source ) .",
    "bob , randomly and independently from alice , measures in one of the bases .",
    "the sifted key consists of the subset of measurements performed when alice s and bob s bases are in an agreed configuration according to the protocol used , obtaining at this point a deterministic outcome whose security relies on the laws of quantum physics , for they previously agreed upon the correspondence between counting a photon in a specific state and the bit values 0 or 1 .",
    "in contrast , the security of conventional cryptography relies upon the unproven difficulty in factorizing large numbers into prime numbers by a conventional algorithm .",
    "we note that there is no guarantee that such an algorithm does not exist .    the underlying feature of qckd",
    ", namely the reliance of the security of the distributed secret key on the laws of quantum physics , gives it an advantage over the public key cryptography .",
    "in other words , the uncertainty principle prohibits one from gaining information from a quantum channel without disturbing it .",
    "basically , qckd is founded on the principle that when a third party ( eve ) performs a measurement on a qubit exchanged , she induces a perturbation , yielding errors in the bit sequence transmitted , revealing her presence .",
    "any attempt by eve to obtain information about the key leads to a nonzero error rate in the generated sifted key .",
    "nevertheless this last claim must be somewhat softened because of practical realization of quantum channels @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in practical systems , errors also happen because of experimental leakage , like losses in optics , detection , electronics and noise .",
    "also , even when no eavesdropper is disturbing the bit exchange , there will be errors in the transmission and alice s and bob s strings will not coincide perfectly .",
    "thus in practice there is no way to distinguish an eavesdropper attack from experimental imperfections , making it necessary to establish an upper bound on tolerable experimental imperfections in the realization of the quantum channels to implement an error correction procedure .",
    "following the first proposal by bennett and brassard and later the ekert protocol invoking entangled states @xcite , various systems of qckd have been implemented and tested by groups around the world .",
    "recently some research groups @xcite performed the first qckd experiments based on polarization - entangled photon pairs , and brassard _",
    "et al_. @xcite proved theoretically that qckd schemes based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) offer enhanced performance , mostly in terms of security , compared to qckd based on weak coherent pulses .",
    "entangled photons , generated by spdc in nonlinear crystals , have proved largely successful for quantum optical communication @xcite and quantum radiometry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , basic experimental tests of the foundation of quantum mechanics had been performed by exploiting the entanglement of this source @xcite . however , quantum noise in a spdc quantum state may significantly limit performance of the proposed quantum optical communication and information technologies .    in this paper",
    "we provide a general model for an _ a priori _ evaluation of some crucial parameters of a general qckd scheme based on polarization entangled photons .",
    "we basically adopt the formalism of quantum operations @xcite to describe the dynamics of an open quantum system subject either to the interactions with the environment or to a quantum device performing a measurement on it .",
    "these unwanted or induced interactions show up as noise in quantum - information processing systems , degrading their ideal performance . exploiting the quantum - operation formalism we present a model to quantify precisely both quantum and ultimately statistical noise in quantum - information experiments performed using an entangled photon source .    in section",
    "ii we consider quantum noise in a lossless measurement system where noise is due to the coupling between the polarization mode of the source with the polarizing beam splitter ports . in section iii",
    "we discuss the case of a lossy system , where noise is induced by detection deficiencies , such as losses of correlated photons from the presence of optical elements , non - ideal detectors , and electronic devices in either channel , and detector dark - counts .",
    "the model concludes with the calculation of an overall probability of total coincidence counts , including an imperfect time - correlation measurement , ultimately yielding an estimate of accidental coincidences ( section iv ) .    this result is used in the calculation of the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) for qckd protocols , i.e. , bb84 and the two variants of the ekert s protocol , based on chsh and wigner s inequalities respectively ( section v ) .",
    "previsions are also presented about the sifted and the corrected key , the quantum - bit error rate ( qber ) before and after a standard error correction procedure .",
    "finally we evaluate the performance of security criteria for ekert s protocols based on both the chsh inequality and wigner s inequality ( section vi ) .",
    "in this section we consider a real either non - maximally entangled or partially mixed state resulting from both imperfect entangled state generation by spdc and imperfect polarization state selection by real polarizing beam splitters ( pbss ) .        in fig .",
    "1 we depict the typical scheme for quantum cryptography key distribution as implemented using entangled photons generated by spdc .",
    "because of a nonlinear interaction in a @xmath0 crystal , some pump photons ( angular frequency @xmath1 ) spontaneously split into a lower - frequency pair of photons , historically called signal and idler , perfectly correlated in all aspects of their state ( direction , energy , polarization , under the constraints of conservation of energy and wavevector momentum , otherwise known as phase - matching)@xmath2 these entangled states show perfect correlation for polarization measured along orthogonal but arbitrary axes .",
    "the qckd performed by pure entangled states relies on the realization of two quantum correlated optical channels .",
    "these channels yield single - photon polarization states , such that whenever alice performs a polarization measurement on a photon of the pair , automatically the other photon is projected in a defined polarization state , i.e. , alice plays the role of triggering bob s measurement .",
    "in actuality , the light field emerging from the output of the nonlinear crystal is a polarization - entangled multimode state .",
    "however , it can be described as a polarization entangled two - photon state in only two effective modes ( one for channel @xmath3 and the other for channel @xmath4 ) , as signal and idler pairs can be easily emitted non - collinearly with the pump by proper phase - matching rules @xcite .",
    "this scheme eventually is exploited in quantum information applications by using one channel as the trigger or reference ( @xmath3 ) and the other channel as the probe ( @xmath4 ) . according to fig . 1",
    ", we denote alice s detector apparatus to be the trigger and bob s to be the probe .",
    "alice and bob detection apparatus consist of polarization - analyzer systems ( pas ) for proper single - beam polarization rotation , polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) , photon detectors ( @xmath5 ) , data storage systems ( computers ) and synchronization systems .",
    "let us consider in the following type ii spdc entangled states @xcite , where the output two - photon states are a quantum superposition of orthogonally polarized photons , i.e. the singlet state @xcite : @xmath6    practically , pure entanglement may not be achieved because of imperfect source generation and because of incomplete entangled photon collection . according to refs .",
    "@xcite an uncompensated for coherence loss , induced in the state by the coupling between polarization and frequency modes because of a birefringent environment , may produce a partially mixed or non - maximally entangled state .",
    "also the collection of the same number of entangled photons on both channels is unlikely , mostly due to the imperfect positioning of the detection systems along the true directions of entangled photons on the spdc cones .",
    "two complex variables , @xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 , characterize the imperfect compensation of dephasing and decoherence in the crystal and the misalignment in collecting entangled photons in the optical paths , respectevely .",
    "the net result is a non - maximally entangled , or partially mixed state , written as @xmath10 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we analyze now the quantum noise introduced via an imperfect polarization state selection by the pbss depicted in fig . 1 . here",
    ", the entangled photons are detected accordingly to their polarizations by using imperfect polarizing beam splitters ( pbss ) on both arms and perfect single - photon detectors .",
    "the pbss project photons onto a polarization basis @xmath11 while the polarization analyzer systems ( pass ) induce the transformations represented by the unitary operators @xmath12 in each arm ( @xmath13 ) , according to @xmath14    in the case of ideal pbss , channel @xmath15 transmits state @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and reflects state @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , i.e. , there is a perfect coupling between the output ports of the pbss and the projections of the photon polarization state . in the approach so far adopted in the literature a perfect coupling is always assumed because the measurement process is considered as a projection on polarization states @xmath20 @xmath18,@xmath21 @xmath22 thus assuming detectors @xmath23 are sensitive to polarization@xmath2 here we consider a further noise effect induced by the presence of real pbss , where a small part of the photons projected onto @xmath24 @xmath25 are erroneously transmitted , and some photons projected in the state @xmath26 @xmath27 are erroneously reflected ( generally less than 2 % and 5 % , respectively ) , as shown in fig .",

    "this paper is concerned with an _ a priori _ evaluation of qckd crucial parameters when entangled photons produced by spdc are exploited .",
    "the basic experimental feature consists in the detection of coincident photons . toward this aim",
    ", we developed a statistical model to calculate the probability of accidental coincidences contributing to errors in the sifted key , not completely accounted for by simple experimental means .",
    "we investigated the noise contribution due to imperfect source generation and selection , imperfect polarizing beam splitters performing polarization states analysis , and noisy and lossy measurement system for photon - number detection .",
    "we emphasized some basic system imperfections such as uncorrelated photons collection , detection system deficiencies , detection system noise due to detector dark counts , and electronic system imperfections associated with non - ideal - time - correlation measurements .",
    "we discussed how this model can be adopted for the evaluation of the qber and the sifted key for different well - known protocols , i.e. , bb84 and ekert s protocols based on both chsh and wigner s inequality , and compared them to expected results .    given that this model predicts precisely the qber and the sifted key",
