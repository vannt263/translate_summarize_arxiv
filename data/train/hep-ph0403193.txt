    "precise computation of the elastic and inelastic fermion form factors in hard collisions is required to test the predictive power of the standard model , as well as the effective and unambiguous detection of signals of new physics at modern and future colliders ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) . in qcd ,",
    "the quark form factors are used in calculations of various qcd processes at the partonic level , and are of a considerable phenomenological importance @xcite . in investigation of @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 energies , the resumed leading and nonleading sudakov corrections to fermion form factors may profoundly influence the cross sections , and play a significant role in calculations for the next linear collider @xcite .    since the pioneering calculation of the resumed double - logarithmic ( dl )",
    "corrections to the elastic electron form factor in qed @xcite , significant progress has been made in evaluation of the next - to - leading logarithmic contributions @xcite , as well as in generalization of these results to the strong ( qcd ) and electroweak ( ew ) sectors of the standard model ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the well - known sudakov elastic form factor @xmath2 of the electron scattering in external electromagnetic field with large transferred momentum @xmath3 @xmath4 has the form @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the mass @xmath7 of the virtual vector boson is introduced in order to regulate the ir divergence .",
    "such a strong suppression of elastic form factor is quite natural since it reflects a small probability for an electron to remain to be itself in this process .",
    "therefore , inelastic processes with emission of one or several real vector bosons become more probable .",
    "although all the exclusive scattering probabilities experience the sudakov type suppression , the total sum of them must be equal to 1 and possess no singularities in the massless limit in accordance with the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem .",
    "such a cancellation can be easily proven in qed using the poisson nature of the inelastic form factor .",
    "as for qcd , the problem of kln cancellation is more complicated due to violation of the poisson form of form factors . nevertheless , the explicit expressions for inelastic form factors with radiative corrections taken into account can be obtained in certain kinematics of the real gluon emission which can be realized in experiment . an effective way to get them",
    "is to apply the kinematic diagram method .",
    "it is the motivation of our paper to calculate the inelastic fermion form factors within this framework .",
    "in this paper , we derive the inelastic form factor of a fermion ( electron , or quark ) in the double - logarithmic ( dl ) approximation @xmath8 where @xmath7 is the mass of a virtual vector boson , and @xmath9 .",
    "a powerful method for calculation of the elastic cross sections in this approximation was developed in the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it was found out that the straightforward calculation of the feynman diagrams was not the most economical way to resume the dl asymptotics of form factors and cross sections .",
    "here we apply a different approach based on the use of the effective kinematic diagrams .    throughout the paper we use the sudakov representation of the four - momenta of the virtual bosons ( neutral massive vector particles , or massive gluons ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the four - momenta of the external fermions , and @xmath13 is the transferred momentum in the scattering channel .",
    "let us remind the main features of the sudakov parameterization @xmath14    the ground of the effective kinematic diagram method is twofold .",
    "the first reason is the strong ordering of the virtual photons in magnitude of transversal components of their four - momenta . for a set of feynman diagrams ( fd ) with @xmath15 virtual vector bosons ,",
    "the main dl contribution arises from the region where their transversal momenta are strictly ordered @xmath16 the second reason is the gribov theorem about validity of the classical current approximation for the emission of vector bosons in the extended region @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this theorem ( in a particular case of the dl calculations ) can be expressed in the following manner : the amplitude of the process @xmath17 can be related with the amplitude of the transition of the almost on - mass - shell quark @xmath18 to the same state @xmath19 @xmath20 if the transversal component of its 4-momentum is small in comparison with the characteristic transversal momentum in the block @xmath19 , where @xmath21 is the polarization vector of the gluon and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the gribov theorem refutes the common belief that the classical current approximation is valid only for soft photons .",
    "consider now the interaction of a virtual gluon having minimal transversal momentum @xmath23 with a quark of momentum @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "the corresponding amplitude being an analytical function of the variable @xmath24 has the pole corresponding to the one - quark intermediate state and the cut which corresponds to the quark - gluon intermediate state ( fig .",
    "let us now prove that the contribution of the cut is suppressed in the dl approximation while it can contribute to the nonleading terms which do not survive in the asymptotic regime .",
    "indeed , keeping in the mind the current conservation condition for the amplitude of the block @xmath25 @xcite @xmath26 and the green function of a vector boson with momentum @xmath27 : @xmath28 ( there are no ghosts in this gauge ) one finds that the cut contribution is associated with the additional factor depending on @xmath29 compared with the contribution of the pole fd .",
    "therefore , in the dl approximation the softest virtual photon ( gluon ) effectively interacts with the quarks having the momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ , it is emitted before all the photons ( gluons ) counting along the quark line , and absorbed after all other gluons .",
    "similar reasons lead to construction of a ladder type fd with all the rungs parallel to each other . in calculation of the corresponding amplitude",
    "it is implied that the virtualities of the vector bosons are strictly ordered ( fig .",
    "( 1c ) ) .    [ fig:1 ]",
    "it is easy to understand that due to this ordering the contributions of such fd can be expressed in terms of the lowest order ( born ) amplitude @xmath30 as @xmath31 , which leads to the sudakov type form factor @xmath32 the condition of ordering can be removed when one considers the whole set of @xmath33 similar expressions obtained by symmetrization of the momenta indices .",
    "thus , the combinatorial factor @xmath34 must be introduced .",
    "this type of the dl behavior can be obtained by explicit calculations in lowest orders of pt in both qed @xcite , @xmath35 , and qcd @xcite , @xmath36 . in appendix",
    "we derive these lowest order expressions .",
    "it can be shown that a possible contribution of longitudinal polarized virtual and real vector particles is suppressed due to the gauge invariance and is irrelevant in the dl regime .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    now let us consider the inelastic electron form factor which includes the emission of a photon with momentum @xmath37 and polarization vector @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "we consider the situation when the transversal momentum of this real hard photon is large compared to the virtual photon mass @xmath7 and the masses of fermions : @xmath39 this corresponds to the kinematics which produces the main contribution to the total cross section . indeed , consider for estimation the contribution to the total cross section in the classical current approximation : @xmath40    again , the effective kinematic ladder fd approach can be applied , but the large magnitude of @xmath41 requires some modification in the ordering procedure .",
    "namely , for the virtual photons emitted above the point where the real photon is emitted ( which is closer to the point of interaction with the external particle ) we must choose the quantity @xmath42 as a lower bound for @xmath43 .",
    "the virtual photons emitted below the point of the external photon emission have @xmath41 as an upper bound .",
    "therefore , the restriction has the following form @xmath44 . denoting the number of the `` up '' photons by @xmath45 and the `` down '' ones by @xmath46 , one obtains the contribution of @xmath15 virtual photons to the amplitude of the one - photon radiative scattering    @xmath47    where @xmath48    further resummation is straightforward .    in the case of emission of @xmath27 real hard photons",
    "we have @xmath49 it is implied that a hard photon is a photon with transversal momentum much larger than masses of fermions and virtual photons .",
    "the contribution to the total cross section is associated with the factor @xmath50 confirming the poisson nature of the neutral vector bosons emission .",
    "the factor @xmath51 takes into account the identity of the emitted bosons .",
    "therefore , we can see that the poisson distribution is valid not only for the soft photons @xcite , but also for the hard ones in the dl approximation @xcite .    in order to establish the consistency of the result",
    "we verify the fulfillment of the kln theorem @xcite about cancellation of the mass singularities , namely @xmath52    in qcd , the ladder approach for calculation of the inelastic form factors with emission of a single gluon works as well",
    ". however , now the virtual ladder gluons can interact ( besides the quarks ) with one real hard gluon with momentum @xmath37 .",

    "the color factor associated with the region when the loop momentum @xmath60 is large as compared with @xmath61 is @xmath62 , since the color generators commute with the external vertex operator @xmath63 .",
