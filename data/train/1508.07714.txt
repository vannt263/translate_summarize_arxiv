    "extracting information from experiments on the dynamics of atoms , molecules or solids , i.e. on the dynamics of their nuclei and electronic charge distribution , is essential for a physical understanding and the verification of theoretical models .",
    "the fastest electronic processes , e.g. photo - ionization , auger decay @xcite , tunneling ionization @xcite , or shake - up @xcite , happen on attosecond time scales . however , before probing of attosecond phenomena became feasible , a number of technical challenges had to be addressed .",
    "one of the most pressing challenges was to develop techniques to characterize the electric field of an isolated attosecond pulse or a train of such pulses as they are generated in the process of high - order harmonic generation .",
    "over the past decade attosecond streaking measurements @xcite have proven to be powerful techniques in extracting information on attosecond photo - electron emission @xcite . with suitable assumptions they allow for a complete characterization of attosecond pulses @xcite , making use of iterative algorithms derived from frequency - resolved optical gating ( frog ) .",
    "this technique became known as frog - crab and the shortest pulses characterized to date were 67  as long @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative algorithm has been developed which is optimized for attosecond streaking @xcite and is especially suitable for pulses approaching the single - cycle limit .    here , we present a new modality for attosecond pulse characterization which is derived from a phase retrieval scheme widely used in lensless imaging , namely ptychography . it is related to the solution of the phase problem in crystallography as proposed by hoppe @xcite and was first demonstrated experimentally at visible wavelengths @xcite . in ptychography a real space object , in particular its amplitude and phase , is reconstructed iteratively from a series of far - field diffraction measurements .",
    "each of those is recorded after either moving the object or the coherent illumination beam in a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the illumination beam . the transverse shift of the illumination beam is smaller than its spatial support , so that subsequent far - field diffraction patterns result from different , but overlapping regions of the object .",
    "the spatial resolution is limited by the positioning accuracy , the stability of the entire setup and the angular range of scattered wavevectors that can be recorded with a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "ptychography has been proven to produce the correct real space image if the illumination beam is known @xcite , but works even if the illumination beam is unknown in which case its profile is reconstructed together with the object @xcite . applying ptychography to the reconstruction of temporal rather than spatial objects requires operating in one dimension with the conjugated variables time and frequency @xcite .",
    "the unknown temporal object is to be reconstructed iteratively from a series of far - field diffraction measurements , i.e. spectra .",
    "each of those is recorded after delaying the coherent illumination pulse with respect to the temporal object with the time delay being smaller than the temporal support of the illumination pulse .",
    "the temporal resolution is primarily limited by the range of spectral amplitudes which can be recorded with a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "recently , we have shown that ptychography can indeed be applied to reconstruct temporal objects if the illumination pulse is fully characterized @xcite .",
    "we have subsequently shown that ptychography is a very powerful technique for ultrafast pulse characterization @xcite . here",
    ", we show that the concept can be extended to attosecond pulse characterization or photo - electron streaking experiments in general .",
    "in attosecond streaking experiments an extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) pulse ionizes atoms in the presence of an infrared ( ir ) laser field @xcite , henceforth called streaking field , and the energy spectrum of the photo - electrons released in the process is measured . with no streaking field present and a sufficiently flat ionization cross section the photo - electron spectrum is a copy of the xuv pulse spectrum . when the streaking field overlaps with the emerging electron wave packet the time dependent ir vector potential is imprinted on the photo - electron spectrum .",
    "the characterization of the xuv pulse is achieved by measuring the streaked photo - electron spectrum for different time delays between the xuv pulse and the streaking field . within the single electron approximation",
    "the spectrum of the photo - electrons generated by the xuv pulse and modified by the streaking field is    @xmath0    with the xuv pulse @xmath1 , the dipole transition matrix element @xmath2 , the gate function @xmath3 , the electron momentum @xmath4 and the ionization potential @xmath5 , all in atomic units .",
    "the gate function is a pure phase gate    @xmath6\\ ] ]    with the vector potential of the streaking field @xmath7 and the unstreaked central momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the measured electron spectra @xmath9 can be readily converted to @xmath10 . when assuming a constant transition matrix element @xmath11 , which is approximately true for not too high streaking fields , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : electron ] ) is the spectrum of the product field @xmath12 .",
    "thus , it should be possible to use the ptychographic iterative engine ( pie ) to reconstruct @xmath1 if @xmath3 is known @xcite or the extended ptychographic iterative engine ( epie ) to reconstruct both the xuv pulse as well as the streaking field @xcite .",
    "ptychography operates on two sampling grids which are largely independent from each other .",
    "the xuv pulse and the streaking field are sampled on an equidistant temporal grid , with @xmath13 samples equally spaced by @xmath14 , which is solely determined by the resolution and total spectral range of the spectrometer used  or by the spectral range which can be detected with a sufficient snr .",
    "the second grid is that of the time delays and consists of @xmath15 samples equally spaced by @xmath16 . both grids may but do not necessarily have to span the same time window .",
    "if they span the same time window the frequency increment of both grids @xmath17 is identical and we find @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the only constraint on the two integers @xmath13 and @xmath15 is @xmath20 but typically @xmath15 is orders of magnitudes smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "ptychography requires @xmath15 spectra @xmath21 which are recorded at different time delays @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) between the xuv pulse and the streaking field .",
    "all spectra combined result in a spectrogram @xmath10 sampled on an @xmath24 grid . as a starting point for the reconstruction algorithm we assume white noise for the xuv pulse , i.e. @xmath25 , and a reasonable gate function @xmath26 obtained from the streaking trace itself using the center of mass method @xcite . in every iteration @xmath27",
    "all measured spectra are processed . for ascending @xmath28",
    "the algorithm first updates the current estimate of the xuv pulse and hereafter the estimate of the gate function .",

    "similarly , the algorithm updates the gate function starting from    @xmath39    as before , @xmath29 is fourier transformed , the modulus is replaced by the square root of the corresponding spectrum @xmath21 and the new function @xmath34 , obtained after an inverse fourier transformation , is used to update the current estimate of the gate function    @xmath40\\ ] ]    with the weight or window function based on the complex conjugate @xmath41    @xmath42    and @xmath430 \\ldots 1]$ ] . since",
    "the gate function has to be a pure phase gate we can impose an additional constraint , i.e. @xmath44 \\}$ ] . in a typical attosecond streaking experiment",
    "the absolute value of the pump - probe time delay is not a priori known but for epie the actual value of the time delay axis is meaningful and its zero can not be arbitrarily defined .",
    "this , however , does not constitute a limitation .",
    "a shift of time delay zero will result in a shift of the time axis of both reconstructed fields , i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , as long as the absolute value of the time delay at which the streaking trace is centered does not fall outside the total time window , the algorithm converges to the correct but temporally shifted solution .",
    "the ptychographic scheme differs from other attosecond reconstruction modalities , such as the principal component generalized projections algorithm ( pcgpa ) @xcite or the least - squares generalized projections algorithm ( lsgpa )",
    "@xcite , specifically : 1 ) the time delay increment is not related to the desired temporal resolution or the wavelength sampling of the spectrometer , but only to the duration of streaking field @xmath3 .",
    "the time delays do not even have to be equidistant .",
    "2 ) typically , only a few spectra have to be recorded .",
    "3 ) the small number of spectra to process and the robust algorithm result in an extremely fast convergence of the retrieval algorithm .",
    "the pcgpa algorithm relies on a spectrogram sampled on an @xmath45 grid that satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "typically the spectral axis has a higher sampling rate than the temporal axis , and as a consequence the temporal axis needs to be interpolated .",
    "naturally , interpolation will neglect any temporal structure finer than the original sampling , thus pcgpa can not accurately reconstruct temporal features which vary more rapidly than the time delay increment . with the lsgpa algorithm",
    "this problem is somewhat relaxed to @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being an integer , as long as two constraints are considered .",
    "firstly , the spectrogram has to be recorded at equidistant time delays ( this constraint might be overcome by using a variable @xmath48 @xcite ) , and secondly , the time delay has to be smaller than the temporal support of the xuv pulse .",
    "in contrast to both , the ptychographic scheme has no direct link between temporal sampling and time delay as explained above .",
    "the time delay increment @xmath16 is related only to the duration of the slowly varying envelope of the streaking field @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant quantity in ptychography is the fundamental sampling ratio .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the full widths at half maximum duration ( fwhm ) of the streaking field over the time delay increment , i.e. @xmath49 / \\delta\\tau$ ] , and if both are identical the fundamental sampling ratio is equal to one . for a fundamental sampling ratio @xmath50 the streaking field overlaps with parts of the xuv pulse several times and this overlap increases the redundancy in the data recorded .",
    "it is well known that this redundancy can be used to not only reconstruct the xuv pulse but also the streaking field @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect attosecond ptychography to work for @xmath50 and indeed we find that @xmath51 gives accurate reconstruction results for both the xuv pulse and the streaking field .",
    "somewhat more challenging is to identify suitable values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 since no theoretical framework exists which can hint to their optimal values . through dedicated simulations we can estimate that @xmath52 scales approximately inverse with @xmath54 . for example , a streaking field duration of 5  fs and a time delay increment of 0.2  fs result in @xmath55 and",
    "consequently @xmath52 should be approximately 0.2 . in order to estimate @xmath53 we resorted to numerical simulations through which we found that @xmath56 gives excellent results .",
    "a small @xmath53 value , i.e. a small update rate of the streaking field , does make sense given the fact that the shape of the streaking field is already relatively well defined through the center of mass method @xcite .",

    "it reconstructs single attosecond pulses as well as trains of attosecond pulses with an unprecedented degree of accuracy . with a judicious choice of the reconstruction constants it works for a large range of time delay increments and a surprisingly small amount of data .",
    "in contrast to all other algorithms , the range of time delays needs to extend only over the temporal support of the xuv pulse but not the streaking field .",
