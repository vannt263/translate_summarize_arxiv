    "queueing processes have been studied extensively , especially due to their practical relevance @xcite .",
    "however , usually the spatial structure of the queues is neglected and the particles in the queues do not interact with each other . on the other hand , the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) which has a spatial structure and excluded - volume effect ( hard - core repulsion ) is one of the best - studied interacting particle systems @xcite . nowadays",
    "the tasep is a basic model for pedestrian and traffic flows @xcite .",
    "recently a queueing process with the excluded - volume effect , the exclusive queueuing process ( eqp ) , was introduced in @xcite and @xcite independently , where the model was formulated as continuous - time and discrete - time markov processes , respectively .",
    "this model can be rephrased as the tasep on a semi - infinite chain with a new boundary condition , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] .",
    "the left end is interpreted as the end of the queue where new customers arrive .",
    "therefore particles can enter at the left site next to the leftmost occupied site .",
    "the ( fixed ) rightmost site corresponds to the server . here",
    "particles can leave the system after getting service . in the bulk a particle can hop to its right nearest neighbor site , if the target site is empty .",
    "after the study @xcite , where the bulk hopping rule is deterministic , the model with discrete time and probabilistic bulk hopping was analyzed @xcite .",
    "earlier works @xcite focussed on the exact probability distribution , physical quantities in the stationary state , and the conditions under which the eqp converges to the stationary state . in this paper , we study the dynamical properties by considering the number of particles and the system length which is defined as the position of the leftmost particle .",
    "we use the same formalism as in @xcite , i.e.  discrete time and parallel - update scheme . for generic hopping probability @xmath4",
    ", we will introduce a domain wall prediction , checking it by monte carlo simulations . in the deterministic hopping case @xmath5 , a rigorous analysis is available , by using the generating function technique @xcite .",

    "particles can enter the chain with probability @xmath6 only at the left site next to the leftmost occupied site .",
    "a particle hops to its right nearest neighbor site with probability @xmath4 , if it is empty , and exits at the right end of the chain with probability @xmath7 .",
    "if there is no particle on the chain , a particle enters at site 1 with probability @xmath6 .",
    "these transitions occur simultaneously within one time step , i.e.  we apply the fully - parallel - update scheme .",
    "we formulate the eqp as a discrete - time markov process on the state space @xmath8 where 0 and 1 correspond to unoccupied and occupied sites , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 denotes the state in which there is no particle on the chain . to simplify the notation",
    "we do not write the infinite number of 0 s located left to the leftmost 1 .",
    "let us review the matrix product stationary state @xcite of the model , which is a simple extension of that for systems with a fixed system length @xcite .",
    "when @xmath10 the stationary state can be expressed as @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are matrices , @xmath14 is a row vector and @xmath15 is a column vector satisfying the algebraic relations @xmath16 these relations are closely related to those for the stationary state of the parallel - update tasep with ordinary open boundary condition @xcite .",
