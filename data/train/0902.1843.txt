    "the quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) may be stated in the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given symmetric @xmath3 matrices , and @xmath4 is the set of @xmath3 permutation matrices .",
    "it is well - known that the qap contains the symmetric traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) as a special case . to show this",
    ", we denote the complete graph on @xmath5 vertices with edge lengths ( weights ) @xmath6 @xmath7 , by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is called the matrix of edge lengths ( weights ) . the tsp is to find a hamiltonian circuit of minimum length in @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath5 vertices are often called _ cities _ , and the hamiltonian circuit of minimum length the _ optimal tour_.    to see that tsp is a special case of qap , let @xmath10 denote the adjacency matrix of @xmath11 ( the standard circuit on @xmath5 vertices ) : @xmath12.\\ ] ] now the tsp problem is obtained from the qap problem ( [ def : qap ] ) by setting @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to see this , note that every hamiltonian circuit in a complete graph has adjacency matrix @xmath15 for some @xmath16 .",
    "thus we may concisely state the tsp as @xmath17    the symmetric tsp is np - hard in the strong sense @xcite , and therefore so is the more general qap . in the special case where the distance function of the tsp instance satisfies the triangle inequality ( metric tsp ) , there is a celebrated @xmath18-approximation algorithm due to christofides @xcite .",
    "it is a long - standing ( since 1975 ) open problem to improve on the @xmath18 constant , since the strongest negative result is that a @xmath19-approximation algorithm is not possible , unless p = np @xcite .    in the case",
    "when the distances are euclidean in fixed dimension ( the so - called planar or geometric tsp ) , the problem allows a polynomial - time approximation scheme @xcite .",
    "a recent survey of the tsp is given by schrijver @xcite , chapter 58 .      in this paper",
    "we will consider semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations of the tsp .",
    "we will introduce a new sdp relaxation of tsp in section [ sec : new relaxation ] , that is motivated by the theory of association schemes .",
    "subsequently , we will show in section [ sec : relation qap ] that the new sdp relaxation coincides with the sdp relaxation for qap introduced in @xcite when applied to the qap reformulation of tsp in ( [ eq : qap reformulation of tsp ] )",
    ". then we will show in section [ sec : cvetkovich ] that the new sdp relaxation dominates the relaxation due to cvetkovi et al .",
    "@xcite . the relaxation of cvetkovi et al .",
    "is known to be dominated by the held - karp linear programming bound @xcite , but we show in section [ sec : held - karp ] that the new sdp bound is not dominated by the held - karp bound ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the space of @xmath20 real matrices is denoted by @xmath21 , the space of @xmath22 symmetric matrices is denoted by @xmath23 , and the space of @xmath22 symmetric positive semidefinite matrices by @xmath24 .",
    "we will sometimes also use the notation @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 , if the order of the matrix is clear from the context .",
    "by @xmath27 we mean the @xmath5-vector composed of the diagonal entries of @xmath28 .",
    "we use @xmath29 to denote the identity matrix of order @xmath5 . similarly , @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 denote the @xmath32 all - ones matrix and all ones @xmath5-vector respectively , and @xmath33 is the zero matrix of order @xmath5 .",
    "we will omit the subscript if the order is clear from the context .    the _ kronecker product _",
    "@xmath34 of matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 is defined as the @xmath37 matrix composed of @xmath38 blocks of size @xmath39 , with block @xmath40 given by @xmath41 @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the hadamard ( component - wise ) product of matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the same size will be denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "in this section we show that the optimal value of the following semidefinite program provides a lower bound on the length @xmath45 of an optimal tour : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the diameter of @xmath11 .    note that this problem involves nonnegative matrix variables @xmath48 of order @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix variables @xmath49 have an interesting interpretation in terms of _ association schemes_.      we will give a brief overview of this topic ; for an introduction to association schemes , see chapter 12 in @xcite , and in the context of sdp , @xcite .",
    "assume that a given set of @xmath3 matrices @xmath50 has the following properties :    * @xmath51 is a @xmath52 matrix for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; * @xmath55 ; * @xmath56 for some @xmath57 ; * @xmath58 for all @xmath59 ; * @xmath60 .",
    "then we refer to @xmath61 as an association scheme .",
    "if the @xmath51 s are also symmetric , then we speak of a symmetric association scheme .",
    "note that item ( 4 ) ( commutativity ) implies that the matrices @xmath62 share a common set of eigenvectors , and therefore can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "note also that an association scheme is a basis of a matrix-@xmath63 algebra ( viewed as a vector space ) .",
    "moreover , one clearly has @xmath64 since the @xmath51 s share a system of eigenvectors , there is a natural ordering of their eigenvalues with respect to any fixed ordering of the eigenvectors .",
    "thus the last equality may be interpreted as : @xmath65 where the @xmath66 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath51 with respect to the fixed ordering .",
    "the association scheme of particular interest to us arises as follows .",
    "given a connected graph @xmath67 with diameter @xmath68 , we define @xmath69 matrices @xmath70 @xmath71 as follows : @xmath72 where dist@xmath73 is the length of the shortest path from @xmath53 to @xmath74 .    note",
    "that @xmath75 is simply the adjacency matrix of @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , one clearly has @xmath77 it is well - known that , for @xmath78 , the matrices @xmath70 @xmath79 together with @xmath80 form an association scheme , since @xmath11 is a distance regular graph .",
    "it is shown in the appendix to this paper , that for @xmath78 , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath70 are : @xmath81 and , if @xmath5 is even , @xmath82 in particular , we have @xmath83 also note that @xmath84 so that each matrix @xmath70 @xmath85 has only @xmath86 distinct eigenvalues .      we now show that setting @xmath87 @xmath85 gives a feasible solution of ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "we only need to verify that @xmath88 we will show this for odd @xmath5 , the proof for even @xmath5 being similar .",
    "since the @xmath70 s may be simultaneously diagonalized , the last lmi is the same as : @xmath89 and by using ( [ eigenvalue symmetry ] ) this becomes : @xmath90 since @xmath91 @xmath92 , and using ( [ orthogonal eigenvalues ] ) , one can easily verify that the last inequality holds . indeed , one has @xmath93",
    "thus we have established the following result .",
    "the optimal value of the sdp problem ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) provides a lower bound on the optimal value @xmath45 of the associated tsp instance .",
    "an sdp relaxation of the qap problem ( [ def : qap ] ) was introduced in @xcite , and further studied for specially structured instances in @xcite .    when applied to the qap reformulation of tsp in ( [ eq : qap reformulation of tsp ] ) , this sdp relaxation takes the form :    @xmath94    it is easy to verify that this is indeed a relaxation of problem ( [ eq : qap reformulation of tsp ] ) , by noting that setting @xmath95 and @xmath96 gives a feasible solution if @xmath16 .    in this section",
    "we will show that the optimal value of the sdp problem ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) actually equals the optimal value of the new sdp relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "the proof is via the technique of _ symmetry reduction_.      consider the following form of a general semidefinite programming problem : @xmath97 where the @xmath98 @xmath99 are given symmetric matrices .",
    "if we view ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) as an sdp problem in the form ( [ sdp ] ) , the data matrices of problem ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) are : @xmath100    we define the _ automorphism group _ of a matrix @xmath101 as @xmath102    symmetry reduction of problem ( [ sdp ] ) is possible under the assumption that the multiplicative matrix group @xmath103 is non - trivial .",
    "we call @xmath104 the symmetry group of the sdp problem ( [ sdp ] ) .    for the matrices ( [ sdp tsp data ] ) , the group @xmath104 is given by the matrices @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the ( permutation matrix representation of ) the dihedral group of order @xmath5 , i.e.  the automorphism group of @xmath11 .    the basic idea of symmetry reduction is given by the following result .",
    "if @xmath107 is a feasible ( resp .",
    "optimal ) solution of the sdp problem ( [ sdp ] ) with symmetry group @xmath104 , then @xmath108 is also a feasible ( resp .",
    "optimal ) solution of ( [ sdp ] ) .",
    "thus there exist optimal solutions in the set @xmath109 this set is called the centralizer ring ( or commutant ) of @xmath104 and it is a matrix @xmath63-algebra . for the group defined in ( [ tsp group ] ) , it is straightforward to verify that the centralizer ring is given by : @xmath110 where @xmath111 $ ] and @xmath112 $ ] for some scalars @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the all - ones vector , as before .",
    "thus we may restrict the feasible set of problem ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) to feasible solutions of the form ( [ block form of feasible solutions ] ) .",
    "if we divide @xmath117 and @xmath118 in ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) into blocks : @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 , then feasible solutions of ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) satisfy @xmath123    feasible solutions have the following additional structure ( see @xcite and theorem 3.1 in @xcite ) :    * @xmath124 @xmath115 is a diagonal matrix ; * @xmath125 @xmath7 is a matrix with zero diagonal ; * @xmath126 @xmath127 ; * @xmath128 ; * @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath129 for feasible solutions , we have @xmath130 @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , since we may also assume the structure ( [ block form of feasible solutions ] ) , we have that @xmath131 for some scalar values @xmath114 .",
    "this implies that the diagonal elements of @xmath124 all equal @xmath114 . since the diagonal elements of @xmath124 sum to @xmath132",
    ", we have @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus the condition : @xmath135 reduces to @xmath136 by the shur complement theorem .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the discrete fourier transform matrix defined in ( [ def : discrete fourier transform matrix ] ) in the appendix .    using the properties of the kronecker product and of @xmath138 we get @xmath139",
    "recall that @xmath140 and that we may assume @xmath125 @xmath7 to be symmetric circulant , say @xmath141 where @xmath142 @xmath85 forms a basis of the symmetric circulant matrices with zero diagonals ( see the appendix for the precise definition ) .",
    "note that the nonnegativity of @xmath125 is equivalent to @xmath143 @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath126 one has @xmath144 since @xmath145 , one also has @xmath146 by the definition of the @xmath142 s , this implies that @xmath147    moreover , @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues ( [ eigs of circulant basis ] ) of @xmath142 on its diagonal .    thus the lmi becomes @xmath150 the left hand side of this lmi is a block matrix with each block being a diagonal matrix .",
    "thus this matrix has a chordal sparsity structure ( @xmath5 disjoint cliques of size @xmath5 ) .",
    "we may now use the following lemma to obtain the system of lmi s ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .    assume a @xmath151 matrix has the block structure @xmath152 where @xmath153 are diagonal @xmath127 .",
    "then @xmath154 if and only if : @xmath155    applying the lemma to the lmi ( [ almost final lmi ] ) , and setting @xmath156 yields the system of lmi s in ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "thus we have established the following result .",
    "the optimal values of the semidefinite programs ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) and ( [ final sdp formulation ] ) are equal .",
    "we will now show that the new sdp relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) dominates an sdp relaxation ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) due to cvetkovi et al .",
    "this latter relaxation is based on the fact that the spectrum of the hamiltonian circuit @xmath157 is known . in particular ,",
    "the smallest eigenvalue of its laplacian is zero and corresponds to the all ones eigenvector , while the second smallest eigenvalue equals @xmath158 .",
    "the relaxation takes the form : @xmath159 subject to @xmath160 note that the matrix variable @xmath107 corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the minimal length hamiltonian circuit .",
    "the sdp relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) dominates the relaxation ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "assume that given @xmath161 @xmath85 satisfy ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath162 while ( [ eq : block sums ] ) and ( [ eq : block sums2 ] ) imply @xmath163 and @xmath164 if @xmath5 is even . in particular , one has @xmath165 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath166 which is the same as showing that @xmath167 since @xmath168 we will show that the lmi ( [ lmi to be derived ] ) may be obtained as a nonnegative aggregation of the lmi s @xmath169 and @xmath170 the matrix of coefficients of these lmi s is a @xmath171 matrix , say @xmath1 , with entries : @xmath172 since we may rewrite ( [ lmi to be derived ] ) as @xmath173 we need to show that the linear system @xmath174 has a nonnegative solution , where @xmath175^t.\\ ] ] one may verify that , for @xmath5 odd , the system @xmath176 has a ( unique ) solution given by @xmath177 note that @xmath178 is nonnegative , as it should be .",
    "if @xmath5 is even , the solution is @xmath179    in the section with numerical examples , we will present instances where the new sdp relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) is strictly better than ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "one of the best - known linear programming ( lp ) relaxations of tsp is the lp with sub - tour elimination constraints : @xmath159 subject to @xmath180 this lp relaxation dates back to 1954 and is due to dantzig , fulkerson and johnson @xcite .",
    "its optimal value coincides with the lp bound of held and karp @xcite ( see e.g.  theorem 21.34 in @xcite ) , and the optimal value of the lp is commonly known as the _ held - karp bound_.    the last constraints are called _ sub - tour elimination inequalities _ and model the fact that @xmath11 is 2-connected .",
    "although there are exponentially many sub - tour elimination inequalities , it is well - known that the lp ( [ subtour elimination relaxation of tsp ] ) may be solved in polynomial time using the ellipsoid method ; see e.g.schrijver @xcite ,  58.5 .",
    "it was shown by goemans and rendl @xcite that this lp relaxation dominates the sdp relaxation ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) by cvetkovi et al . @xcite .",
    "the next theorem shows that the lp relaxation ( [ subtour elimination relaxation of tsp ] ) does not dominate the new sdp relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) , or vice versa .",
    "[ th : no dominating relaxation ] the lp sub - tour elimination relaxation ( [ subtour elimination relaxation of tsp ] ) does not dominate the new sdp relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) , or vice versa .",
    "define the @xmath181 symmetric matrix @xmath182 as the weighted adjacency matrix of the graph shown in figure [ fig : barx ] .    .",
    "[ fig : barx ] ]    the matrix @xmath182 satisfies the sub - tour elimination inequalities , since the minimum cut in the graph in figure [ fig : barx ] has weight @xmath183 .    on the other hand ,",
    "there does not exist a feasible solution of ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) that satisfies @xmath184 , as may be shown using sdp duality theory .",
    "conversely , in section [ sec : numerical examples ] we will provide examples where the optimal value of ( [ subtour elimination relaxation of tsp ] ) is strictly greater than the optimal value of ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) ( see e.g.  the instances gr17 , gr24 and bays24 there ) .",
    "in addition to the sub - tour elimination inequalities , there are several families of linear inequalities known for the tsp polytope ; for a review , see naddef @xcite and schrijver @xcite , chapter 58 .    of particular interest to us",
    "is a valid nonlinear inequality that models the fact that @xmath11 has @xmath5 distinct spanning trees . to introduce the inequality we require a general form of the _ matrix tree theorem _ ; see _ e.g. _  theorem vi.29 in @xcite for a proof .",
    "[ matrix tree theorem ] let a simple graph @xmath67 be given and associate with each edge @xmath185 a real variable @xmath186 .",
    "define the ( generalized ) laplacian of @xmath76 with respect to @xmath178 as the @xmath69 matrix with entries @xmath187 now all principal minors of @xmath188 of order @xmath189 equal : @xmath190 where the sum is over all distinct spanning trees @xmath191 of @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath188 is the usual laplacian of a given graph , then @xmath192 for all edges @xmath193 of the graph , and expression ( [ number of spanning trees ] ) evaluates to the number of spanning trees in the graph .",
    "thus if @xmath107 corresponds to the approximation of the adjacency matrix of a minimum tour , then one may require that : @xmath194 where @xmath195 denotes the principle submatrix of @xmath107 obtained by deleting the first row and column .",
    "the inequality ( [ minor inequality ] ) may be added to the above sdp relaxations ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) and ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) ( with @xmath196 ) , since the set @xmath197 is lmi representable ; see e.g.  nemirovski @xcite ,  3.2 .",
    "we know from numerical examples that ( [ minor inequality ] ) is not implied by the relaxation of cvetkovi et al .",
    "( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) , but do not know any examples where it is violated by a feasible @xmath198 of the new relaxation ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have been unable to show that ( [ minor inequality ] ) ( with @xmath196 ) is implied by ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) .",
    "in table [ tab : bounds ] we give the lower bounds on some small tsplib instances for the two sdp relaxations ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) and ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) , as well as the lp relaxation with all sub - tour elimination constraints ( [ subtour elimination relaxation of tsp ] ) ( the held - karp bound ) .",
    "these instances have integer data , and the optimal values of the relaxations were rounded up to obtain the bounds in the table .",
    "the sdp problems were solved by the interior point software csdp @xcite using the yalmip interface @xcite and matlab 6.5 , running on a pc with two 2.1 ghz dual - core processors and 2 gb of memory .",

    "the new sdp bound ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) is only stronger than the held - karp bound ( [ subtour elimination relaxation of tsp ] ) for the instances 16 , 21 and 23 in table [ tab : nis8 ] , and for the instances 1 , 5 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 22 the two bounds coincide . for the remaining 18 instances the held - karp bound is better than the sdp bound ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) . however ,",
    "if the bounds are rounded up , the sdp bound ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) is still better for the instances 16 , 21 and 23 , whereas the two ( rounded ) bounds are equal for all the other instances . adding the lmi cut from ( [ minor inequality ] ) did not change the optimal values of the sdp relaxations ( [ cvetkovich relaxation of tsp ] ) or ( [ final qap relaxation of tsp ] ) for any of the instances .    for @xmath199 , there are 192 classes of facet defining inequalities of the tsp polytope @xcite . here",
