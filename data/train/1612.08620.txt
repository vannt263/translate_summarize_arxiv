    "the study of numerical methods for the approximation of partial differential equations on polygonal and polyhedral meshes is drawing the attention of an increasing number of researchers ( see , e.g. , the special issues @xcite for a recent overview of the different methodologies ) . among the different proposed methodologies , here we focus on the virtual element method ( vem ) which has been introduced in the pioneering paper @xcite and can be seen as an evolution of the mimetic finite difference method , see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "recently , vem has been analyzed for general elliptic problems @xcite , linear and nonlinear elasticity @xcite , plate bending @xcite , cahn - hilliard @xcite , stokes @xcite , helmholtz @xcite , parabolic @xcite , steklov eigenvalue @xcite , elliptic eigenvalue @xcite and discrete fracture networks @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "several different variants of the vem have been proposed and analysed : mixed @xcite , discontinuous @xcite , @xmath0 and @xmath1-conforming @xcite , hp @xcite , serendipity @xcite and nonconforming @xcite vem .",
    "such a flourishing research activity founds an important motivation in the great flexibility that the use of polytopal meshes can ensure in dealing with problems posed on very complicated and possibly deformable geometries . in this respect , as first recognized by g.h .",
    "paulino and his collaborators in a series of ground breaking papers @xcite , topology optimization represents an intriguing challenge for the use of polyhedral meshes .",
    "topology optimization is a fertile area of research that is mainly concerned with the automatic generation of optimal layouts to solve design problems in engineering .",
    "the classical formulation addresses the problem of finding the best distribution of an isotropic material that minimizes the work of the external loads at equilibrium , while respecting a constraint on the assigned amount of volume .",
    "this is the so - called minimum compliance formulation that can be conveniently employed to achieve stiff truss - like layout within a two - dimensional domain . a classical implementation resorts to the adoption of four node displacement - based finite elements that are coupled with an elementwise discretization of the ( unknown ) density field .",
    "when regular meshes made of square elements are used , well - known numerical instabilities arise , see in particular the so - called checkerboard patterns . on the other hand ,",
    "when unstructured meshes are needed to cope with complex geometries , additional instabilities can steer the optimizer towards local minima instead of the expected global one .",
    "unstructured meshes approximate the strain energy of truss - like members with an accuracy that is strictly related to the geometrical features of the discretization , thus remarkably affecting the achieved layouts . on this latter issue , as pointed out also in @xcite , the use of polyhedral meshes provide flexibility in the difficult computational task of meshing complex geometries , while , in parallel , it can contribute to avoid that the geometry of the mesh dictates the possible layout of material and the orientation of members , thus excluding physical optimal configurations from the final design obtained by the numerical procedure .",
    "the aim of this paper is to push forward the study of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors analyze the possibility of avoiding sub - optimal ( non - physical ) layout in topology optimization for structural applications when _ polygonal finite elements _ and polytopal meshes are employed , whereas in @xcite the virtual element method is employed for solving compliance minimization and compliant mechanism problems in three dimensions . in @xcite _ polygonal finite elements _ are employed to solve topology optimization problems governed by stokes equations on polygonal meshes . in view of the above contributions , and with",
    "the goal of deepening the comprehension of the role of vem and polygonal meshes in topology optimization , we focus on the use of this latter method for solving topology optimization governed by linear elasticity ( compressible and nearly - incompressible ) and stokes flow . for each of the above examples",
    ", we systematically consider the impact that the combined approach vem and polygonal meshes has on the quality of the obtained layout and compare them with the ones provided by standard approaches .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ s:2 ]",
    "we present the continuous formulation of the topology optimization problems that we will consider throughout the paper , while in section [ s:3 ] we introduce the corresponding virtual element discretizations . in section [ s:4 ] we present and extensively discuss several numerical experiments assessing the virtues of the combined use of vem and polygonal meshes in solving each of the previously introduced topology optimization problems .",
    "finally , in section [ s:5 ] we draw some conclusion .",
    "we briefly recall the continuous formulations of the topology optimization problems we are interested in , namely the minimum compliance problem governed by the linear elasticity equation ( section  [ s : compliance ] ) and the optimal flow problem governed by the stokes equation ( section  [ s : stokes ] ) .",
    "we first recall some notation that will be useful in the following .",
    "let @xmath2 be a two - dimensional bounded , polygonal domain with boundary @xmath3 and let @xmath4 be a subset of the boundary of the domain .",
    "we introduce the following spaces @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a possibly null given function .",
    "moreover , let us introduce the control space @xmath7 of bounded functions representing the material density in @xmath2 , where @xmath8 is some positive lower bound .      in this section",
    "we shortly describe the topology optimization problem for minimum compliance .",
    "this corresponds to find the optimal distribution of a given amount of linear elastic isotropic material ( described by an element of @xmath9 ) such that the work of the external load against the corresponding displacement at equilibrium is minimized .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be the lam coefficients of the given material and introduce the bilinear form @xmath12 defined as follows @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the symmetric gradient .",
    "moreover , let us introduce the semi - linear form @xmath15 @xmath16 where , according to the classical simp approach , we set @xmath17 and @xmath18 , being @xmath19 and @xmath20 positive parameters ( typically equal to @xmath21 ) . clearly , when @xmath22 in @xmath2 we have @xmath23 . finally , let the linear functional @xmath24 be defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the given function @xmath27 represents the external load . in view of the above definitions , given a material distribution described by the function @xmath28 , the elasticity problem ( or direct problem ) reads as follows : find @xmath29 such that @xmath30 for any @xmath31 .",
    "according to the clapeyron theorem , the continuous formulation of the topology optimization problem for minimum compliance governed by the elasticity equation can be therefore written as : @xmath32 being @xmath33 the available amount of material as a fraction of the whole domain @xmath34 . minimizing",
    "the compliance @xmath35 of a structure acted upon by a prescribed set of assigned forces means minimizing the work of external loads , i.e. looking for a stiff structure .",
    "when @xmath36 we refer to as the minimum compliance problem in the case of nearly - incompressible elasticity , otherwise for moderate values of @xmath10 we refer to it as the minimum compliance problem in the case of compressible elasticity .      in this section",
    "we recall the classical topology optimization problem for optimal stokes flows @xcite : given a design domain @xmath2 with certain boundary conditions , we are interested in determining at what places of @xmath2 there should be fluid or solid in order to minimize a certain energy functional @xmath37 ( subject to the constraint of the availability of a given amount of fluid ) .",
    "more precisely , let us introduce the bilinear form @xmath38 where @xmath11 is the viscosity of the fluid , @xmath10 is a penalty parameter employed to enforce the incompressibility condition and @xmath39 .",
    "given a material distribution described by the function @xmath40 , the stokes problem ( or direct problem ) reads as follows : find @xmath41 such that @xmath42 thanks to the choice of @xmath43 , it turns out that the solution @xmath44 of the above problem is null where @xmath45 and solves a plane flow model where @xmath46 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this amounts to interpret the region where @xmath47 as occupied by a solid material , whereas the region where @xmath46 as occupied by the fluid .",
    "+ in order to formulate our optimization problem , let us introduce the energy functional @xmath48 which is a measure of the dissipated energy associated the pair @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the optimal flow problem governed by the stokes equation reads as @xmath50",
    "in this section we introduce the virtual element discretization of the topology optimization problems and , which will be addressed in sections [ s : compliance_d ] and [ s : stokes_d ] , respectively .",
    "let @xmath51 represent a decomposition of @xmath2 into general , possibly non - convex , polygonal elements @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . in the following , we will denote by @xmath55 the straight edges of the mesh @xmath51 and , for all @xmath56",

    "we will use the symbol @xmath58 to denote the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath59 living on the set @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , we will work under the following mesh regularity assumption on @xmath51 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :    [ meshass ] we assume that there exist positive constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that every element @xmath63 is star shaped with respect to a ball with radius @xmath64 and every edge @xmath56 has at least length @xmath65 .    let us first introduce the discrete counterpart of the space @xmath9 , namely the finite dimensional space of piecewise constant admissible controls @xmath66 clearly , a function @xmath67 is uniquely determined by its value @xmath68 in each polygon @xmath69 . hence , the dimension of @xmath70 equals the cardinality of @xmath51 .",
    "following @xcite , it is possible to introduce the low - order discrete vem spaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 , a discrete form @xmath73 approximating @xmath74 and a discrete functional @xmath75 approximating @xmath76 such that the vem discretization of reads as : given @xmath67 find @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for any @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , the global vem spaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 are obtained by gluing suitable local discrete vem spaces , denoted by @xmath82 , whose elements are uniquely identified by the values at the vertices of the polygon @xmath52 and contain linear polynomials , i.e @xmath83 .",
    "it is immediate to verify that the dimension of @xmath80 ( the same happens for @xmath81 ) equals two times the number of the interior vertices of the partition @xmath51 plus those belonging to @xmath84 , having fixed the values at vertices belonging to @xmath85 to incorporate dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "more precisely , according to @xcite , we have @xmath86 where @xmath87    let us now define the projection operator @xmath88 solution of @xmath89 for all @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the bilinear form @xmath92 restricted to the element @xmath52 and , for any regular function @xmath93 , we set @xmath94 it is easy to see that @xmath95 is computable from the degrees of freedom of the local vem space .",
    "+ the construction of the global form @xmath96 hinges upon the construction of local forms @xmath97 defined as @xmath98 where the bilinear form @xmath99 is a suitable stabilization term with the same scaling properties of the sum of the first and second term ( see @xcite for more details ) . then , the global form reads as follows : @xmath100 where we employed the fact that @xmath101 .",
    "+ in the case of nearly - incompressible materials , i.e. for @xmath36 , the local discrete bilinear form is modified as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the @xmath104-projection on constant functions and the bilinear form @xmath99 is a suitable stabilization term with the same scaling properties of the first term .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "[ rem : inf - sup ] for nearly - incompressible elasticity , in @xcite it is not theoretically proved that the resulting lowest - order discrete vem problem stemming from is well posed .",
    "however , in @xcite , it is reported numerical evidence that , in the context of mimetic finite differences ( mfd ) , the formulation is well posed on hexagons .    according to the previous considerations",
    ", the vem discretization of the topology optimization problem reads as follows : @xmath105      hinging upon the results of the previous sections , the virtual discretization of easily follows . indeed ,",
    "bearing in mind , the discrete virtual counterpart of reads as : given @xmath67 find @xmath77 such that @xmath106 for any @xmath79 , where as usual the global discrete form @xmath96 is defined in terms of the local forms as @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the same as in ( [ form_disc : elast ] ) and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath104-projection and the bilinear form @xmath111 , as above , is a suitable stabilization term with the same scaling properties of the first term .",
    "note that , using the _ augmented space argument _",
    "( see @xcite ) , on the local vem space the projections @xmath112 and @xmath95 coincide , thus @xmath112 is computable .",
    "+ in order to formulate the discrete optimization problem , let us introduce the energy functional @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the virtual discretization of reads as @xmath114",
    "several numerical examples are presented in this section dealing with the vem discretization of the topology optimization problems introduced above . the minimum compliance problem governed by compressible ( section  [ num : compr ] ) and nearly - incompressible linear elasticity ( section  [ num : incompr ] ) is solved , as well as the optimal flow problem governed by the stokes equation ( section  [ num : stokes ] ) .",

    ", we can draw the following conclusions :    * optimal layouts do not seem to be affected by the geometrical features of the polygonal mesh , whereas the use of standard quadrilateral grids may steer the optimization process towards sub - optimal ( non - physical ) configurations ; * optimal layouts obtained with polygonal meshes seem to be robust with respect to mesh rotations , whereas rotated standard quadrilateral grids may give rise to different optimal configurations ; * optimal configurations obtained on polygonal meshes seem to be mesh independent , i.e. they do not seem to depend on the granularity of the computational mesh ; * optimal layouts in the case of topology optimization governed by nearly - incompressible elasticity or stokes flow have been successfully identified , thanks to the accuracy and stability properties of the adopted virtual element approximation .",
