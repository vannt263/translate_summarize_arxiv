    "supergiant shells with sizes approaching 1000  pc form the largest structures seen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "such shells have been detected in the hi  21-cm and h@xmath3  lines in our galaxy , local group galaxies , and more distant galaxies ( tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) .",
    "these supergiant shells contain 10@xmath410@xmath5 ergs of kinetic energy , which is most likely contributed by multiple supernovae and energetic stellar winds over several dozen myr .",
    "the size of a supergiant shell often exceeds the scale height of the gaseous disk of its host galaxy , thus forming a `` chimney '' through which energy and mass flow into the galactic halo .",
    "therefore , supergiant shells play important roles in the global evolution of the ism in a galaxy .",
    "it is difficult to study supergiant shells in detail .",
    "their distances , and so their sizes and energies , remain uncertain in our galaxy ; furthermore , interstellar obscuration often prevents observations at optical , uv and x - ray wavelengths . for distant galaxies , angular resolution becomes a severe limiting factor .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) offers a happy compromise , as it is close ( 50  kpc ; feast 1999 ) and has little obscuration ( a@xmath6 mag ; bessell 1991 )    nine supergiant shells with sizes ranging from 600 to 1400  pc have been reported in the lmc , lmc19 ( goudis & meaburn 1978 ; meaburn 1980 ) .",
    "only two of these shells have been studied in detail  lmc2 and lmc4  because lmc2 is the most spectacular and lmc4 is the largest .",
    "both supergiant shells are filled with hot plasma : diffuse x - ray emission has been detected in lmc2 by wang & helfand ( 1991 ) using _ einstein _  imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) data , and in lmc4 by bomans , dennerl , & krster ( 1994 ) with a 46 ksec _",
    "position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observation .",
    "lmc2 is substantially brighter in x - rays than lmc4 and all other supergiant shells in the lmc .",
    "the physical and kinematic structure of lmc2 has been reported by points et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "it is found that two different mechanisms are responsible for generating the x - ray - emitting plasma : ( 1 ) local heating by supernova remnants ( snrs ) , e.g. , the emission region enclosed by the northeast rim ; and ( 2 ) outflows from active star formation regions , e.g. , the bright x - ray arc extending from n158 ( notation from henize 1956 ) to n159 ( or snr0540 - 693 to lmcx-1 ; see figure  1b ) .",
    "the south end of lmc2 is confusing .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission , while peaking within the shell , extends beyond the southern border of lmc2 .",
    "it has been speculated that this x - ray spur represents a blowout of lmc2 , but no optical or radio supporting evidence has been found .",
    "lmc2 clearly demonstrates the existence of hot gas interior to a supergiant shell , and illustrates different mechanisms of generating the hot gas .",
    "spatially resolved spectral analysis of the x - ray emission within lmc2 and neighboring regions is the most effective way to determine the physical conditions of the hot plasma and establish its role in the multi - phase interstellar medium .",
    "the x - ray emission from the interior of lmc2  has not been studied since its initial detection with the _ einstein _  ipc .",
    "those ipc data were not used to make a detailed spectral analysis , however , because they had low spectral resolution and were contaminated by hard x - rays scattered from lmc  x-1 to large off - axis angles ( wang & helfand 1991 ) . to study the distribution of x - ray emission toward lmc2",
    ", we have obtained _ rosat _  pspc and high resolution imager ( hri ) observations of lmc2 .",
    "furthermore , to determine the physical conditions of the x - ray emitting plasma interior to lmc2 , we have also obtained _ asca _   solid - state imaging spectrograph ( sis ) observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations used in this study and their reduction .",
    "the distribution of the hot ( @xmath0  k ) plasma and its relationship to the warm ( @xmath7  k ) and cold ( @xmath8  k ) interstellar component of lmc2  is discussed in  3 . in ",
    "4 we describe the physical condition of the hot gas . in ",
    "5 we compare the physical properties of lmc2  with other objects that exhibit diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "we summarize our results in  6 .",
    "the x - ray data reported in this paper were obtained using the _ rosat_pspc and hri and the _ asca _  sis .",
    "the x - ray images of lmc2  were obtained with the _ rosat _  x - ray telescope , using both the pspc and the hri .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , we have mosaicked a large number of independent pspc and hri observations to provide extensive angular coverage , and considerably deeper exposure than provided by the _",
    "rosat _   all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "the data were retrieved through the _ rosat _  public archive at the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) at the goddard space flight center .",
    "the region surrounding lmc2  has been extensively covered by pspc observations of the many sources in the vicinity ( e.g. , snrs & x - ray binaries ) and by the hri survey program of chu & snowden ( 1998 ) which was designed to cover the 30  doradus and bar regions of the lmc with deep and uniform coverage .",
    "tables a1 and a2 list the observation sequences that were used for the mosaics of the pspc and hri , respectively .",
    "these tables include the number of data sets for each sequence ( individual observations were occasionally processed in sections ) , pointing direction , exposure time , and target name .",
    "the data reduction was accomplished using the extended source analysis software ( esas ) package ( snowden & kuntz 1998 ; kuntz & snowden 1998 ) , which is also available through the heasarc .",
    "the final pspc and hri mosaics are cast in the same projection with the field center at @xmath9 ( 5@xmath1042@xmath11,@xmath12 ) and pixel size of 30@xmath13 and 20@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the projection is the zenith equal - area azimuthal ( zea ; @xcite ) , which is similar over this solid angle to the more common tangential projection .",
    "reduction of the pspc data followed the procedures outlined by snowden et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and demonstrated by snowden & petre ( 1994 ) , and in fact included a reprocessing of data in the latter paper .",
    "individual observations were screened for anomalous background conditions , had their residual non - cosmic background components modeled and subtracted , and had their vignetted and deadtime - corrected exposures calculated . only after all of the individual observations were reduced in six statistically - independent energy bands ( see table  1 ) were they cast into the mosaics . because the analysis software can not correct for zero - level offsets ( a constant component of the long - term enhancement non - cosmic background , see @xcite ) , the mosaicking process must correct for the relative offsets between overlapping fields .",
    "a single - value deconvolution algorithm was applied to a system of equations comprising all overlaps between separate observations to determine a best fit for all offsets simultaneously .",
    "a final constraint was added so that the sum of the offsets were equal to zero .",
    "individual observations were then adjusted by multiplying the fitted offset by the exposure map to produce an offset count image , which was then subtracted from the count image .",
    "this procedure was run separately on each energy band .",
    "table  2 lists some values of interest for the reduction .",
    "the true source counts can be seen to completely dominate the non - cosmic background and the average exposures are larger by more than an order of magnitude than that of the rass coverage .",
    "although these source counts include emission from 30  doradus , lmc  x-1 , and various snrs , lmc2  is well above non - cosmic background .",
    "the total coverage of the field is @xmath14  deg@xmath15 .",
    "we have extracted a @xmath16  deg@xmath15 sub - image of the lmc2  region from the larger mosaic and present it in figure  1a .",
    "the reduction of hri data is simplified from that of pspc data .",
    "there is only the total energy band , and only the particle background is modeled and removed .",
    "the particle background of the hri completely dominates an hri observation with an average count rate @xmath17 times greater than the cosmic background .",
    "it must be removed as the distribution of the particle background is flat across the field while cosmic counts are vignetted .",
    "unfortunately , the particle background is also only calibrated to @xmath18% or so , but this is sufficient for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the contributions from other non - cosmic background components are ignored as they are `` in the noise . '' because these components are for the most part distributed as a vignetted flat field , they contribute a zero - level offset which is corrected in the mosaicking , which is done in the same manner as for the pspc .",
    "the total coverage of the field is @xmath19  deg@xmath15 . in figure",
    "1b we present a sub - image from this mosaic that has the same field - of - view as figure  1a .",
    "the x - ray spectra in this paper were obtained with the _ rosat _   pspc and the _ asca _  sis . here",
    "we discuss the reduction of the x - ray spectral data .",
    "we discuss their analysis in  4 .",
    "we extract x - ray spectra of lmc2  from a _ rosat _  pspc observation of the snr dem  l  316 ( _ rosat _  sequence no .",
    "rp500259n00 ) .",
    "the pspc is sensitive in the energy range of 0.1  2.4  kev , and has an energy resolution of @xmath20% at 1  kev .",
    "this observation has been discussed in some detail in williams et al .",
    "therefore , we only present a brief summary here .",
    "the observation was made within the time interval from 1993 january 10 to 1993 february 10 .",
    "for this observation , the snr dem  l  316 ( @xmath21 5@xmath1047@xmath1195 ; @xmath22 ) was centered in the pspc .",
    "the total exposure time for the observation was 4.0  ksec .",
    "we processed these data using xselect and ftools , which are available through the heasarc .",
    "the data were spatially binned to produce 75 @xmath23 75 pixels . using the binned pspc image , we defined three regions of interest : a bright region in the northern part of lmc2  ( pspc - north ) , a bright x - ray arc in the west ( pspc - arc ) , and a region in the x - ray spur to the south of lmc2  ( pspc - spur ) .",
    "these regions are shown in figure  1a . because lmc2  is an extended source and all the regions",
    "are located outside the central pspc `` ring '' ( radius 20@xmath24 ) , we selected background regions of the same size and off - axis angle to correct for the charged particle background . during the reduction process we also performed vignetting corrections .",
    "we present the regions coordinates , angular sizes , net counts , and effective exposure times in table  3 .",
    "our _ asca _  observation is of a bright x - ray region in the northern section of lmc2  ( see figure  1a ) .",
    "this observation was performed on 1995 august 25  26 ( _ asca _  sequence no .",
    "53039000 ) .    the _ asca _  satellite consists of two instruments that observe simultaneously  a pair of sis and a pair of gas imaging spectrographs ( gis ) .",
    "the sis has an energy coverage approximately in the 0.5  8  kev range and the gis in the 0.8  10  kev range ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) . in this paper , we have only used the sis data because of the low sensitivity of the gis for energies below @xmath25  kev , where diffuse thermal plasma emission is brightest .",
    "the sis detectors have good spectral resolution @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the angular resolution of the sis data is poor compared to the _ rosat _  pspc , with a narrow core of @xmath27 diameter and a half - power radius of 3@xmath24 . both of the sis detectors ( sis  0 and sis  1 )",
    "are composed of four separate ccds .",
    "not all of the ccds can be on for a given observation as the presence of `` hot '' and `` flickering '' pixels can fill the telemetry with false signals .",
    "because of telemetry limitations , our observations were performed in the 2-ccd mode , with part of the bright northern region of lmc2   in the sis  0 ( chips 0 & 1 ) and sis  1 ( chips 0 & 3 ) .",
    "we have extracted spectra from sis  0 chip  1 and sis  1 chip  3 , because they image the same area on the sky and lie in a region of bright emission .",
    "we reduced and processed the data with ascascreen and ftools . because lmc2  is more extended than the sis field - of - view no region from any of our _ asca _",
    "observations were suitable to perform a background subtraction .",
    "therefore , we used the _ asca _",
    "deep field pointings , screened in a manner identical to the lmc2  data , to obtain regions for background subtraction . in table  3 , we also present relevant information on the two _ asca _  sis chips that were used in this paper .",
    "we have also extracted spectra in the regions covered by sis  0 chip  0 and sis  1 chip  0 ; however , these data were not analyzed because the count rates were low and these spectra can not be fitted by models with reasonable certainty .",
    "lmc2  consists of interstellar gas in several phases .",
    "as reported in paper  i , we have obtained ( 1 ) _ rosat _  pspc and hri mosaics to investigate the spatial distribution of the hot ionized gas interior to lmc2 , ( 2 ) ccd images of lmc2  in optical emission lines to examine the shell of warm ionized gas , and ( 3 ) 21-cm hi  data to study the structure of the cold , neutral gas .",
    "below we describe the distribution of the x - ray emitting plasma and its relation to the other gaseous components .",
    "the existence of hot ( @xmath0  k ) gas interior to lmc2  was first detected using the _ einstein _  ipc ( wang & helfand 1991 ) .",
    "as seen in our _ rosat _  pspc and hri mosaics ( figures  1a & 1b , respectively ) , lmc2  lies toward the brightest and most complex region of diffuse x - ray emission in the lmc .",
    "this region includes 30  doradus , lmc2 , the supergiant shell lmc3 , and a bright x - ray spur to the south of lmc2 , as well as snrs ( e.g. , dem  l  299 , dem  l  316 , and snr 0540@xmath2869.3 ) and an x - ray binary ( lmc  x-1 ) .",
    "these features are labeled on our hri mosaic in figure  1b .",
    "a cursory inspection of our pspc and hri mosaics reveals that the x - ray surface brightness of lmc2  is not uniform .",
    "the brightest region of diffuse x - ray emission associated with lmc2  is an arc in the southwestern quadrant that appears to extend from snr  0540@xmath28693 to lmc  x-1 .",
    "a region of low x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) lies between this bright x - ray arc and a region of bright x - ray emission in the northeast .",
    "the observed variation in x - ray surface brightness can be attributed to non - uniform emission from lmc2  and/or to non - uniform absorption of x - rays by intervening interstellar gas . as discussed below",
    ", we find that both of these explanations must be taken into account for the observed x - ray surface brightness toward lmc2 .",
    "it is of considerable importance in our study of the physical conditions interior of lmc2  to determine whether the variation in x - ray surface brightness is the result of non - uniform absorption or emission . to investigate this matter we first compare the x - ray mosaics with h@xmath3  emission line images that trace regions of current massive star formation .",
    "as the hot gas toward lmc2  is most likely shock - heated by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of massive stars , we expect to see correspondence between x - ray and h@xmath3  features .",
    "we present an h@xmath3  image of lmc2  overlaid with x - ray contours in figure  2 .",
    "we find three results of note in this comparison : ( 1 ) the x - ray emission from lmc2  is confined by the optical filaments ; ( 2 ) the bright x - ray arc is centered on the hii  region n160 . based on the optical and x - ray morphology and high resolution echelle spectra of the h@xmath3  line , we suggest that the arc is formed by an outflow of hot gas from n160 into lmc2  ( paper  i ) . ( 3 ) the hii  region n163 ( @xmath31 ) is coincident with a small region of low x - ray surface brightness .",
    "comparison of the pspc mosaics ( snowden & petre 1994 ) shows that this depression in x - ray surface brightness is more pronounced in the soft x - ray band ( r4 ) than in the hard x - ray band ( r7 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that n163 lies in front of the x - ray emitting gas and absorbs the soft x - rays from lmc2 .",
    "we further compare the x - ray mosaic with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) aperture synthesis maps of the 21-cm hi   emission line toward lmc2  that reveals the presence of neutral atomic gas ( figure  3 ) .",
    "we know that hi  exists in front and in back of lmc2 .",
    "thus , we can not simply expect variations in the hi  column density to anti - correlate with the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "instead we use the shadowing effect to look for correlations between features in the hi  channel maps with x - ray surface brightness .",
    "as reported in paper  i , a region of low x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath32 ) is coincident with an hi  cloud detected in the hi  channel maps . as in the case of the region with low x - ray surface brightness seen toward n163 ,",
    "this depression is more apparent in the r4 band mosaic than the r7 band mosaic .",
    "therefore , this hi  gas component most likely lies on the front side of lmc2  and absorbs the x - rays emitted from within lmc2  ( paper  i ) .",
    "the _ rosat _  pspc and _ asca _",
    "sis data provide x - ray spectra of lmc2that can be used to derive the physical conditions of the hot gas .",
    "we will first describe the procedures used to perform the x - ray spectral fitting and the uncertainties involved .",
    "then we will use the plasma temperature , foreground absorption column density , and x - ray emissivity obtained from the spectral fits to estimate the electron density , surface mass density , and surface thermal energy density of the hot gas .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra are a convolution of the intrinsic spectra , the foreground absorption , and the detector response function .",
    "because the foreground absorption and detector response are both energy dependent , we need to assume models of the intrinsic spectra and absorption cross - sections to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "we simulate the observed spectra by folding the assumed intrinsic emission and foreground absorption models with the detector response .",
    "the observed spectra are fitted by the simulated spectra ; the @xmath33 of the fits is used to determine the best - fit .    the x - ray emission from lmc2 , as seen in the hri mosaic ( figure  1b ) , is truly diffuse , indicating a hot - plasma origin .",
    "therefore , we adopt raymond & smith s ( 1977 ) thin plasma emission models for the intrinsic spectra .",
    "we use morrison & mccammon s ( 1983 ) effective absorption cross - sections per hydrogen atom to model the foreground absorption .",
    "the pspc and sis data were fitted separately because they were extracted from different regions toward lmc2 .",
    "the spectral fitting of the _ asca _",
    "sis data was more difficult than the fitting of the _ rosat _  pspc data .",
    "the sis data were contaminated by scattered , high - energy photons from the bright nearby source lmc  x-1 , an x - ray binary with an accretion disk .",
    "therefore , in the fitting procedure for the sis data we added a powerlaw and a blackbody disk component , but held the values of the power law photon index and the blackbody disk temperature constant at the values determined by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for lmcx-1 .",
    "we allowed the values of the raymond - smith plasma temperature and absorption column to float to the best - fit values .",
    "this is not a perfect method to determine the plasma temperature and absorption column of lmc2  because the scattering of the x - ray photons is both energy- and position - dependent .",
    "we may fit the sis  0 chip  1 and sis  1 chip  3 data simultaneously with the same model because these data were extracted from the same region on the sky .",
    "we performed multiple model fits for each of the extracted regions using xspec in which we allowed the abundance to be 20% , 30% , and 40% solar .",
    "although varying the abundance did not noticeably affect the best - fit values of the plasma temperature and absorption column , it did change the parameter space of the @xmath33 grid plots of the confidence contours .",
    "we find that the range of possible values for the plasma temperature and absorption column are better constrained for the models with 40% solar abundance . for the remainder of this work , however , we use the results from the 30% solar abundance models , the canonical lmc value . although our choice to use the best - fit values from the 30% solar abundance models may seem arbitrary , this allows us to compare our results with other studies of the hot , ionized medium in the lmc (  5 ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath33 grid plots for a thermal plasma with 40% solar abundance may cover a smaller area of parameter space because the hot gas has been enriched above the canonical lmc value through the actions of stellar winds and supernova explosions of massive stars .",
    "we performed a @xmath33 grid search of possible fits in order to determine the uncertainties in the fits for temperature ( @xmath34 ) and absorption column density ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the best - fit plasma temperature and absorption column for a 30% solar abundance raymond & smith ( 1977 ) thermal plasma model for pspc and sis data , as well as the range of the 90% confidence contours , are given in the top section of table  4 . in figures  4 & 5 ,",
    "we present the x - ray spectra of the different regions , and their @xmath33 grid plots for a thermal plasma with 30% solar abundance , respectively .",
    "the grid plots show the range of @xmath33 fits for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for each extracted region ; the three contour levels represent the areas of 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence .    to better constrain the range of @xmath35 , and thus to better confine the range of plasma temperatures",
    ", we calculate the hi  column density toward lmc2 .",
    "the galactic values of @xmath35 toward lmc2  are @xmath36  @xmath37 , determined using the ftool `` nh '' which is derived from the hi  map of dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "the lmc values of @xmath35 toward lmc2  are @xmath38  @xmath37 using the parkes multibeam hi  survey .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath34 for the fixed @xmath35 model fits , as well as the 90% confidence ranges for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given in the bottom section of table  4 .",
    "in general , the fixed @xmath35 column density is lower than that determined by the floating @xmath35 x - ray spectral fits ( see table  4 ) , similar to results obtained toward 30  doradus ( wang 1999 ) .",
    "this appears to be problematic because the parkes multibeam survey samples neutral hithat is both in front of and behind lmc2 .",
    "it seems reasonable that the fixed @xmath35 column density should represent an upper limit of the absorption column between us and the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that x - rays are also absorbed by molecular and ionized gas that are not measured in the 21-cm hi  emission - line survey , but are measured by the x - ray spectral fits .",
    "observations of the @xmath39 co emission line at 2.6  mm made with the nanten 4-m radio telescope ( fukui et al .",
    "1999 ) do not show co emission toward the lmc2  regions of interest in this investigation .",
    "the lack of co emission does not necessarily imply an absence of molecular gas toward the selected regions .",
    "the lower dust abundance of the lmc allows uv photons , which would dissociate co molecules , to penetrate more deeply into molecular clouds and form c@xmath40 regions",
    ". observations of the [ cii ] 158@xmath41 m emission line toward lmc2  reveal that the distribution of c@xmath40 is more diffuse than the distribution of co ( mochizuki et al .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the molecular gas is in a very diffuse phase in which co is rare because of photo - dissociation .",
    "our calibrated ccd h@xmath3  images of lmc2  ( paper  1 ) show the emission measure , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the electron density and @xmath44 is the path length through the h@xmath3  emitting gas in pc , range from @xmath45  @xmath46  pc in the arc region to @xmath47  @xmath46  pc in the spur region . if the path length through the h@xmath3  emitting gas is comparable to the width of the filaments defining the eastern boundary of lmc2  ( @xmath48  pc ) , the ionized column densities toward the regions range from @xmath49  @xmath37 in the spur to @xmath50  @xmath37 in the arc .",
    "it is conceivable that the derived absorption column from the free @xmath35 x - ray spectral fits may be unrealistically higher than the measured absorption column toward the x - ray spectral regions .",
    "therefore , we use the fixed @xmath35 spectral fit parameters for the remainder of this work .      from the model fits to the pspc and sis x - ray spectra , we can calculate the unabsorbed x - ray flux , and hence the x - ray luminosities , of the selected regions . given a hot gas filling factor @xmath51 , volume @xmath52 , x - ray luminosity @xmath53 , and emissivity @xmath54 ,",
    "the electron density of the hot plasma of the selected regions will be @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "for the regions toward lmc2  and the spur , the volume of the gas is the product of the projected surface area of the region and the path length through the gas .",
    "we adopt a path length comparable to the width of the interstellar structure in question ( i.e. , 140  pc for the bright northern region , 230  pc for the bright x - ray arc , and 400  pc for the spur ) .",
    "the x - ray emissivity , @xmath54 , is a function of the plasma temperature . from our fixed @xmath35 x - ray model fits to the data , we find that the emissivity of the regions ranges from @xmath57  erg  @xmath58  s@xmath59 in the 0.44  2.04  kev energy range .",
    "we derive the electron densities for the extracted regions toward lmc2  using the x - ray luminosities and emissivities determined by our fixed @xmath35 spectral fits and present them in table  5 .",
    "as seen in figure  1a , the x - ray surface brightness varies from region to region toward lmc2 .",
    "because lmc2  covers a large portion of the pspc field - of - view , parts of it are obscured by the pspc window support structure .",
    "thus , we can not extract a single x - ray spectrum of lmc2  to determine the integrated x - ray flux of the hot gas .",
    "instead , we determine the total count rate of lmc2  from the pspc mosaic in the 0.44 to 2.04  kev energy band .",
    "if we assume that lmc2  is filled by hot gas with a plasma temperature @xmath60  kev and an absorption column of @xmath61  @xmath37 , we can use pimms to calculate the intrinsic x - ray flux of lmc2  to be @xmath62  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath59 .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray flux of the spur is calculated to be @xmath63  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath59 for a thermal plasma with temperature @xmath64  kev and a hydrogen absorption column of @xmath61  @xmath37 .",
    "we caution the reader , however , that these derived values of the x - ray flux were made assuming a uniform absorption column between us and lmc2  and the spur .",
    "therefore , these values do not accurately reflect the global x - ray fluxes of either of these interstellar structures .",
    "as x - ray fluxes have now been calculated for both lmc2   and the spur , we may be tempted to derive their physical conditions , such as electron density ( @xmath65 ) , thermal energy ( @xmath66 ) , and hot gas mass ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this approach , however , would ignore the uncertainties inherent in the assumptions we made in our previous calculation of the intrinsic x - ray flux of lmc2  and the spur , such as the emitting volume , temperature , and the emissivity of the hot , thermal plasma .",
    "furthermore , we have shown in  3 that the absorption column across lmc2  is non - uniform .",
    "therefore , the physical conditions of the hot gas interior to lmc2  and the spur can not be realistically derived using the global x - ray fluxes calculated in  4.2 . instead , we opt to focus on the physical conditions of the hot gas toward the extracted spectral regions because the plasma temperatures , x - ray fluxes , and hot gas emissivities are explicitly determined by the x - ray spectral fits . to further minimize uncertainties in the derived physical conditions of the hot gas toward our extracted spectral regions ,",
    "we calculate the surface thermal energy density ( @xmath68 ) and the hot gas surface mass density ( @xmath69 ) instead of @xmath66 and @xmath67 because they depend on the assumed path length through the hot gas , but not the volume .    in the following analysis",
    "we derive the physical properties of the hot gas in our selected regions toward lmc2 . as an example",
    ", we calculate the physical properties of the hot gas in the pspc - arc region .",
    "the electron density of this region is @xmath70  @xmath71 .",
    "the surface mass density of the hot gas is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the effective volume of the emitting gas and @xmath74 is the surface area of the region in arcmin@xmath75 .",
    "assuming that @xmath76 , the surface mass density of the hot gas in the arc ranges from 65 to 90  @xmath77  arcmin@xmath78 .",
    "if the x - ray emitting gas behaves as an ideal gas , the surface thermal energy density is given by @xmath79 .",
    "for the arc , this gives @xmath80  erg  arcmin@xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , we may also estimate the number of supernova explosions required to produce the hot gas interior to lmc2 , based on our derived value of @xmath68 . for a supernova explosion with a total energy of @xmath81  erg ,",
    "the thermal energy of the hot gas of the snr is @xmath82  erg and has a radius of @xmath83  pc after 10@xmath84  yr ( slavin & cox 1992 ) . at the distance to the lmc",
    ", the surface thermal energy density of the snr would be @xmath85  erg  arcmin@xmath78 .",
    "thus , if the hot gas interior to lmc2  was produced entirely by a series of supernova explosions @xmath86  yr ago , then the number of supernova explosions required to energize the arc is 125  175 .",
    "we have obtained ubv photometry to investigate the star formation history toward lmc2 .",
    "those data will allow us to determine the amount of energy massive stars have deposited in the ism of lmc2  and will be compared with the thermal energy that is derived here .",
    "the physical properties of the arc , as well as those for the other regions toward lmc2 , are presented in table  6 .    before comparing the physical properties of the hot gas interior to lmc2  with the physical properties of hot gas in other interstellar structures , we re - iterate the assumptions that underlie our calculations .",
    "the first factor we consider that contributes to the uncertainty in our calculations is the volume of the x - ray emitting gas in each of the regions . in this work",
    "we simply assume that the volume of a region is the product of its projected surface area and the path length through the region .",
    "because the depth through these regions is uncertain , an increase of the path length by a factor of 2 would alter our determination of the electron density by factor of @xmath87 and our calculations of the the surface thermal energy density and mass by a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "another factor affecting the derivation of the physical properties of the hot gas interior to lmc2  is the volume filling factor , @xmath51 .",
    "we have determined the physical conditions of the hot gas using a filling factor of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . a filling factor of @xmath89 increases the derived values of n@xmath91 by a factor of @xmath88 and decreases the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 by a factor of @xmath87 , with respect to the values determined using a filling factor of @xmath92 . inspection of figures  1a & 1b reveals that the distribution of the x - ray emission is relatively smooth and does not show much structure .",
    "thus , it is likely that the value of the filling factor of the hot gas interior to lmc2  lies between these two bounds .",
    "the last factors that need to be considered as contributing to the uncertainty in our results are the best - fits to the plasma temperature , @xmath34 , the absorption column , @xmath35 , and the normalization constant , @xmath93 , defined as @xmath94 . as seen in the @xmath33 grid plots ( figure  5 )",
    ", the confidence contours for the pspc data show that the thermal plasma spectrum can be fitted by a low plasma temperature and high absorption column or by a high plasma temperature and a low absorption column .",
    "for example , if we take the plasma temperature of the pspc - north region to be the free @xmath35 model best - fit ( @xmath95  kev ; @xmath96  @xmath37 ) , the derived values of @xmath65 and @xmath69 are @xmath97 times the values derived using the fixed @xmath35 model fit values ( @xmath60  kev ; @xmath98  @xmath37 ) . in this example , the surface thermal energy density is @xmath99 times the value calculated for the fixed @xmath35 model fits and the intrinsic x - ray flux , @xmath100 is increased by a factor of @xmath101 .",
    "the hot gas in the ism is produced by shocks from supernova blasts and fast stellar winds from massive stars .",
    "consequently , the amount of hot gas and its physical conditions depend upon the spatial distribution and formation history of massive stars .",
    "massive stars will form discrete snrs if they are isolated , superbubbles if there is a single burst of star formation such as an ob association or supergiant shells if there are multiple bursts of star formation that have taken place over a period of time in a concentrated area .",
    "snrs , superbubbles , and supergiant shells are all filled by hot gas which contributes to the him ( hot ionized medium ; mckee & ostriker 1977 ) component of the ism in galaxies .",
    "thus , it is of interest to compare the physical conditions of the hot gas in these interstellar structures .",
    "below we compare the physical properties of the hot gas interior to lmc2  with those of : ( 1 ) another supergiant shell in the lmc , lmc4 ; ( 2 ) two superbubbles in the lmc , n11 and n44 ; and ( 3 ) a number of snrs in the lmc .",
    "we present the physical properties of these objects in table  7 .",
    "the values of the physical properties for these objects were made using the _ rosat _  bandpass of 0.1  2.4  kev and assuming a hot gas filling factor of @xmath92 unless otherwise noted .",
    "the pioneering study of diffuse x - ray emission from within a supergiant shell in the lmc was performed on lmc2  by wang & helfand ( 1991 ) using data obtained with the _ einstein _",
    "ipc which operated in the energy range from 0.4 to 4.0  kev . therefore , as a consistency check , we first compare our results of the physical conditions of the hot gas interior to lmc2  to those which they derive . because a detailed spectral analysis of lmc2  could not be performed using the ipc data , wang & helfand ( 1991 ) used the mean hardness ratio of the excess x - ray emission from lmc2  to estimate the temperature of the hot gas . by assuming an optically thin thermal plasma with 50% solar abundance for the emission and a foreground absorption of @xmath102  @xmath37 , they determine the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas to be @xmath103  kev .",
    "wang & helfand ( 1991 ) assume the geometry of lmc2  to be spherical and adopt two different radii to determine the volume and physical properties of the 10@xmath84  kgas : ( 1 ) a radius of @xmath104  pc that covers only the arc region , and ( 2 ) a radius of @xmath105  pc that encompasses the entire supergiant shell .",
    "they find the density of the hot gas to be @xmath106  @xmath71 or @xmath107  @xmath71 for an adopted radius of 250  pc or 500  pc .",
    "their derived values of the unabsorbed x - ray flux , @xmath100 and the electron density , @xmath65 are given in table  7 .",
    "using their derived values , we calculate the surface thermal energy density , @xmath68 , to be @xmath108  erg  arcmin@xmath78 and @xmath109  erg  arcmin@xmath78 for a spherical bubble of hot gas with a radius of 250  pc and 500  pc , respectively .",
    "the results obtained using the _ einstein _  ipc data are in good agreement with those we determined using the _ rosat _  pspc data , but not with the sis data . for example , their values for the plasma temperature ( @xmath110  kev ) and the absorption column ( @xmath111  @xmath37 ) fall within the 90% confidence contour limits of our @xmath33 grid - plots of the pspc data , but not the sis data ( see figure  5 ) . a factor that may produce a discrepancy between the x - ray spectral fits to our dataset and the analysis of the ipc data is that wang & helfand ( 1991 ) assume a uniform hydrogen column density toward lmc2 . we have shown in  3.2 that the variations in x - ray surface brightness toward lmc2  are caused by non - uniform absorption and emission . as discussed previously , a higher adopted absorption column will result in a lower value for the plasma temperature .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the differences between the observed spectral properties and the derived physical conditions can be attributed to the differences in the adopted absorption column .",
    "in addition to lmc2 , diffuse x - ray emission has also been detected in the northern quadrant of the supergiant shell lmc4 ( bomans , dennerl , & krster 1994 ) using the _ rosat _   pspc in the energy range between 0.1 and 2.4  kev .",
    "they find that the best fit raymond & smith ( 1977 ) plasma temperature to the data is @xmath112  kev and the best fit absorption column is @xmath113  @xmath37 . if the diffuse x - ray emission from the northern quadrant of lmc4 is representative of lmc4 as a whole , the x - ray flux is @xmath114  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath59 for this supergiant shell . assuming that lmc4 is a cylinder with a radius of 600  pc , a height of 1200  pc , and an x - ray emissivity of @xmath115  erg  @xmath58  s@xmath59",
    ", they derive an electron density of @xmath116  @xmath71 . using these values",
    "we calculate the surface thermal energy density of lmc4 to be @xmath117  erg  arcmin@xmath78 .",
    "the derived values of @xmath118 , @xmath65 , and @xmath68 are listed in table  7 .",
    "the plasma temperature of the hot gas interior to lmc4 ( @xmath112  kev ) is comparable to that we have determined for lmc2  at the 90% confidence level , but the absorption column is about an order of magnitude lower .",
    "the primary distinction between the x - ray emitting plasma in lmc2  and lmc4 is that the electron densities in the regions toward lmc2  are a factor of @xmath119 greater than that derived for lmc4 . as we have used the same filling factor and a similar x - ray emissivity for the @xmath0  k gas as bomans et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the difference in the derived electron densities can be ascribed to the higher unabsorbed x - ray flux determined for lmc2  and/or through uncertainties in the volume of the emitting thermal plasma .",
    "if we adopt a path length through our selected regions toward lmc2  comparable to that of lmc4 ( i.e. , @xmath120  pc ) , our derived electron densities would be lowered only by a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the electron density of the hot gas interior to lmc2  is generally higher than the electron density interior to lmc4 .      diffuse x - ray emission has been detected in several lmc superbubbles .",
    "here we discuss the physical conditions of the hot gas interior to the superbubbles in n11 and n44 , the two most luminous hii  regions in the lmc after 30 doradus ( kennicutt & hodge 1986 ) .",
    "n44 has the highest x - ray surface brightness among all superbubbles in the lmc ( chu & mac low 1990 ) , while n11 is only moderately x - ray bright ( mac low et al .",
    "the physical properties of the hot gas interior to these two superbubbles are given in table  7 .",
    "raymond & smith ( 1977 ) spectral model fits to _ rosat _",
    "pspc observations of n11 give a best - fit plasma temperature of @xmath122  kev ( mac low et al .",
    "this plasma temperature is higher than the model spectral fits to our pspc data toward lmc2 , but is comparable to plasma temperatures determined by the model fits to the sis data . using their results",
    "we calculate the electron density of n11 to be @xmath123  @xmath71 and the surface thermal energy density to be @xmath124  erg  arcmin@xmath78 .    both pspc and sis data have been obtained for n44 ( magnier et al .",
    "because these observations cover the same region on the sky , the pspc and sis x - ray spectra were fit simultaneously with a thermal plasma emission model .",
    "the model fits give a plasma temperature of @xmath125  kev for the hot gas interior to n44 ( magnier et al .",
    "assuming a filling factor of @xmath89 , they derive an electron density of @xmath126  @xmath71 from which we calculate the surface thermal energy density to be @xmath127  erg  arcmin@xmath78 .    the plasma temperatures of the hot gas interior to n11 is similar to those we determine for the hot gas interior to lmc2  using the pspc and sis data , but are higher in n44 .",
    "the electron density and surface thermal energy density for n11 are on the same order as for the regions toward lmc2 .",
    "the electron density of the hot gas interior to n44 is a factor of @xmath128 times higher than that derived for lmc2 , but the surface thermal energy density is @xmath129 times lower .",
    "some of the difference between the derived physical conditions of the hot gas interior to lmc2  and n44 may be attributed to the fact that magnier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used a hot gas filling factor of @xmath89 .",
    "the effects of changing the filling factor from @xmath92 to @xmath89 are discussed in  4.3 .",
    "supernova explosions are the main producers of the him in galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to understand the physical properties of the hot gas interior to snrs , in order to understand the physical conditions of hot gas interior to superbubbles and supergiant shells .",
    "fortunately , the lmc contains a large number of snrs ( @xmath130 ; williams 1999 ) that have been studied extensively at optical and radio wavelengths ( mathewson et al .",
    "1983 ; 1984 ; 1985 ) and x - ray wavelengths ( williams et al . 1997 ; 1999 ; williams 1999 ; hughes et al .",
    "williams ( 1999 ) has compiled the most comprehensive list of the x - ray properties of lmc snrs to date . of the lmc snr sample ,",
    "twenty - three have _ rosat _  pspc data available with sufficient count rates for spectral modeling . for this dataset , williams ( 1999 )",
    "finds that the plasma temperature ranges from @xmath131 to 0.89  kev and that the electron density ranges from @xmath132 to @xmath101  @xmath71 .",
    "the published physical conditions of 4 of these snrs are listed in table  7 .",
    "clearly , the hot gas interior to snrs in the lmc shows a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "this is not surprising as they have different ages and interstellar environments .",
    "we see that most of these lmc snrs have plasma temperatures that are higher than lmc2 , but have electron densities that are comparable to it .",
    "the supergiant shell lmc2  has the highest x - ray surface brightness of all lmc supergiant shells .",
    "we have obtained _ rosat _  pspc and hri mosaics to study the distribution of x - ray emission from lmc2 .",

    "regions of low x - ray surface brightness are well - correlated with regions of high hi  column density , suggesting that some of the variations in x - ray surface brightness toward lmc2  are caused by non - uniform absorption .",
