    "mobile devices have become ubiquitous computing and communication devices .",
    "one of the main interaction methods with these devices is the touch - screen virtual keyboard . however , touch - screen keyboards have drawbacks including limited screen size causing user inconvenience and entry errors , occlusion of the keys by the user s fingers , fixed configuration options to support internationalization and/or special needs , and security issues that can leak users passwords and other critical information @xcite . additionally , there are many cases where a physical keyboard can provide better experience for users ranging from kids to elderly with special needs .",
    "recently , a number of techniques have been proposed to replace the touch - screen keyboard including vision - based @xcite , acoustic @xcite , and wireless signals @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques suffer from occlusion , interference from other moving humans , surrounding noises , and/or high energy consumption .",
    "in addition , they are only tailored to work with specific devices .    in this paper , we present , a ubiquitous homomorphic off - the - shelf magnetic field - based keyboard for mobile phones . allows the user to control the applications virtual keyboard using custom - printed keyboards ( figure  [ fig : real_kids_calculator ] ) .",
    "the user utilizes an off - the - shelf magnet to specify the different keystrokes by determining the magnet location on a virtual grid imposed over the printed keyboard , leveraging the phone s built - in standard magnetometer . to accurately determine the magnet s location , constructs a * _ one - time factory - based _ * micro fingerprint of the virtual grid relative to the phone ; during normal operation , it uses a probabilistic framework to achieve high key detection accuracy . compensates for differences in phones , magnets , and polarity changes .",
    "it is also resilient to various environment noises through a * _ simple first - use process that takes less than one minute_*. moreover , provides application developers and regular users with tools to extend their applications with homomorphic keyboards ( i.e. the same application can have different printed keyboards ) that can fit varying user needs , which traditionally require os changes or a lengthy error - prone software keyboard development process .",
    "we deploy on different android phones and extensively evaluate its performance in different environments , with various orientations , users , and magnets .",
    "our results show that can achieve a key detection accuracy of more than 91% under all scenarios .",
    "in addition , for a custom calculator keyboard application , it can achieve 100% detection accuracy .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : system ] presents the necessary background followed by the architecture and operation of .",
    "details of our implementation and extensive evaluation are shared in section  [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses different aspects of .",
    "finally , sections [ related_work ] and [ sec : conclusion ] discuss related work and conclude the paper respectively .    0.3        0.3        0.3",
    "in this section , we present our system .",
    "we first provide some background on the magnetic field and the notation that will be used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "afterwards , we present the system architecture along with a typical usage scenario . finally , we describe in detail the different components that handle various challenges including variations in mobile devices , magnets , and users .",
    ".notations used in the paper . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section , we extensively evaluate the performance of using the calculator application shown in figure  [ fig : real_kids_calculator ] . for the evaluation purpose , four users used the application over seven days ( different magnets / devices ) and the user counted the number of mis - detections ( if any ) .",
    "the results show that has 100% key detection accuracy .",
    "this can be explained by noting that all cells in the calculator area ( the red rectangle in figure  [ fig : heatmap ] ) have a localization error less than one centimetre .",
    "in addition , the size of the smallest calculator button is 4@xmath14 cm .",
    "note that larger keyboards may cover the entire grid area and can lead to lower accuracy than in this particular case study .",
    "however , can still provide its 100% accuracy in the majority of cases as discussed in the next section .",
    "we also tested the calculator application on samsung mini s4 , sony z2 , and sony xperia tipo with standard touch screen .",
    "the number of covered buttons in the experiment is 16 , each button is clicked 20 times .",
    "the accuracy for both samsung mini s4 and sony z2 is around 99% ( 3 misses for samsung mini s4 and 2 misses for sony z2 out of 320 ) and the accuracy for sony tipo is 98% ( 5 misses out of 320 ) .",
    "provides a ubiquitous homomorphic keyboard that can suit different users needs .",
    "all that is required is a phone with a magnetometer and an off - the - shelf magnet , even those available in children toys .",
    "s ubiquity comes from its independence from the background magnetic interference , phone orientation , polarity , devices heterogeneity , and differences between magnets .",
    "the independence of magnetic interference and phone orientation comes from the offset removal process .",
    "the first - time use calibration process that maps the factory calibrated fingerprint to a new phone / magnet makes it independent of the devices heterogeneity and magnets differences .",
    "finally , changes in polarity are handled through a simple comparison with a reference reading as part of enabling the system",
    ".    currently supports discrete detection of pressed keys . however , there are a number of applications that require continuous tracking , such as a virtual mouse , touch pads , paint programs , and some games .",
    "our initial results on localization accuracy in section  [ sec : impact_of_spatial_averaging_parameter_k ] shows promising tracking results in the continuous case of less than 10 mm , which can be further improved algorithmically . due to space constraints",
    ", we leave this to future work .",
    "currently , is designed to track a single magnet .",
    "this is useful for a large number of applications , e.g. applications for kids and the visually impaired as well as for the continuous tracking case as in drawing applications .",
    "however , supporting multiple magnet tracking can be useful for a number of applications , such as full keyboard typing .",
    "multi - object tacking is a well - studied problem in other domains ( e.g. computer vision @xcite and device - free localization @xcite ) , where techniques can be borrowed .",
    "we leave the multi - magnet localization problem for a future paper .    noting that the further away from the magnet the lower the accuracy of detection due to the weak magnetic field , the application designer can take this into account in the `` _ _ keyboard designer _ _ '' module , e.g. by placing less frequently used keys at locations with higher errors .",
    "this can also be automated by a new system module .",
    "finally , co - occurrence models of different keys can be used to further enhance accuracy by dynamically changing the new key probabilities based on the previous detected keys .",
    "this can incorporated easily in our probabilistic estimation framework as @xmath2 in equation  [ equ : bayesian_inversion ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss various related work to in two areas : magnet - based interaction systems and keystrokes recognition systems .      the human body is transparent to static and low - frequency magnetic fields , which makes magnetic tracking a promising technique in a number of human - computer interaction applications .",
    "a number of systems have been proposed for the continuous tracking of a magnet location based on nonlinear models of the relation between the magnetic field and distance @xcite .",
    "however , such systems usually require multiple external high - accuracy magnets and/or assume that the magnet diameter is very small relative to the distance between the magnet and the point ( _ limiting the tracking area to a few millimeters _ ) .",
    ", on the other hand , can be operate with magnets with any size and provides millimeter - level accuracy for much larger areas .",
    "similarly , magpen @xcite uses a * _ specially designed hardware _ * stylus that combines a magnet with capacitive sensing to extend the functionality of the current styluses .",
    "abracadabra @xcite is a magnetically - driven input approach for smart watches .",
    "it senses the movement of a magnet placed on the fingertip to determine its relative position from the watch .",
    "this information is used to control a cursor , make selections , or issue basic gestures .",
    "abracadabra , though , depends on a high - accuracy external magnetometer sensor to avoid the noises inside the mobile device .",
    "similarly , nenya @xcite employs an external magnetometer to track two specific motions of ring : twisting around the user finger and sliding along the finger .",
    "both abracadabra and nenya have been evaluated with * _ a specific phone and magnet_*. , in contrast , uses standard phone sensors , which have higher noises , and can work with any phone or magnet as we show and quantify in the paper .",
    "in addition , it can differentiate between a large number of cells and , hence , is can be used with a wider set of applications .",
    "the magiwrite @xcite and magsign @xcite systems use a machine learning approach to detect few specific patterns of the magnetometer motion .",
    "specifically , magiwrite detects only the * _ 10 digits _ * and magsign detects the * _ one specific _ * user signature for authentication purposes .",
    ", on the other hand , is designed to work with any keyboard and can differentiate a large number of cells .",
    "in addition , it has been tested with different phones and magnets and can handle different magnet polarities .",
    "presents a homomorphic ubiquitous keyboard based on magnetic field .",
    "its main advantage is the ability to work with any mobile phone or magnet with minimal effort .",
    "in addition , it gives both the application developers and users the flexibility of designing their custom keyboards that fit different needs .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed in literature to recognize keystrokes including vision - based @xcite , acoustic - based @xcite , electromagnetic emission - based @xcite , and wifi - based approaches @xcite .",
    "vision based approach , e.g. @xcite , recognizes keystrokes based on analyzing the captured video of the users fingers .",
    "acoustic - based approach recognizes keystrokes either based on the time the sound takes from the pressed key to the acoustic receiver , e.g. @xcite , or based on the different acoustic signatures of the different keys on the keyboard , e.g. @xcite . on the other hand , electromagnetic emission - based approaches , e.g. @xcite ,",
    "recognize keystrokes based on that the electromagnetic emission from the electric circuits underneath different keys in a keyboard .",
    "wifi - based approaches extend the concept of wifi - sensing @xcite , @xcite and device free localization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and leverage the channel state information of the received mimo wifi system to detect the finger location @xcite .",
    "all these systems suffer from occlusion ; interference from other movement , humans , surrounding noises ; and/or high energy consumption .",
    "in addition , they are only tested with specific devices .",
    "in contrast , proposes a novel technique of keystrokes recognition based on magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is a more promising technique as it is transparent to human motion and the magnetometer consumes order of magnitude less energy compared , e.g. , to the camera or wifi .",
    "moreover , has different modules to handle the magnetic interference and designed and tested to work with any mobile device or magnets .",
    "in this paper , we have shared the design and implementation of . leverages a one - time factory - based fingerprint in a probabilistic framework to enable custom - designed keyboards that can fit different user s needs .",
    "it has a number of modules that makes it work with heterogeneous devices and magnets with different shapes , sizes , and strengths .",
    "in addition , it can handle other practical deployment scenarios such as changes in magnet polarity .",
    "evaluation of on different android devices in various realistic scenarios shows that it can achieve 91% key detection accuracy for keys as small as 2@xmath12 cm , increasing to 100% for 4@xmath14 cm keys .",
    "this accuracy is robust to different phones and magnets .",
    "in addition , we presented a detailed evaluation of a custom calculator case study showing a detection accuracy of @xmath3 for all keys .",
