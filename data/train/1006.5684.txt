    "a semi - riemannian manifold is said to be _ conformally semi - symmetric _ if the weyl tensor @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4}c_{cdef } = 0;\\ ] ] and _ ricci semi - symmetric _ if the ricci tensor satisfies @xmath5}r_{cd } = 0.\\ ] ]    the geometrical properties of semi - symmetric spaces where discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we find all semi - symmetric , ricci semi - symmetric and all conformally semi - symmetric spacetimes .",
    "eriksson and senovilla @xcite found all such non - conformally flat spacetimes .",
    "it is an advantage to instead of tensors rather to use the weyl spinor @xmath6 , the curvature scalar spinor @xmath0 , and the spinor @xmath7 for the tracefree part of the ricci tensor .",
    "we also use the spinor @xmath8 .",
    "the spinor commutator @xmath9 operating on spinors with one index is @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .    in spinors ( [ conformallysemisymmetric ] )",
    "is equivalent to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or @xmath14",
    "calculation of the components of ( [ weylcondition1 ] ) in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath0 shows show that it not will have 15 independent components but rather just 5 components and ( [ weylcondition1 ] ) can be replaced by its contraction over @xmath15 or @xmath16    we observe that the spinor commutator @xmath9 yields 0 if operating on a scalar as the curvature scalar @xmath0 , therefore only its effect on @xmath7 , i.e. on the tracefree part of the ricci tensor has to be considered .",
    "the second condition for ricci semi - symmetry ( [ weylcondition2 ] ) corresponds to spinor equations @xmath17 the condition ( [ riccicondition2 ] ) is however just the complex conjugate of ( [ riccicondition1 ] ) and will not give any additional conditions for ricci semi - symmetry .",
    "equation ( [ riccicondition1 ] ) has three groups of two symmetric indices but will in fact not have 27 independent components as @xmath18 , it can be replaced by the fully symmetric spinors @xmath19 with 15 and 9 components respectively .",
    "the various spacetimes are for simplicity studied in a frame where first @xmath6 has been brought to a standard form depending on its petrov type .",
    "thereafter @xmath7 is brought to standard form depending on its segre type @xcite .",
    "all of the above formulas have been implemented in classi @xcite .",
    "the equations for ricci semi - symmetric spacetimes ( [ phicondition1 ] ) and ( [ phicondition2 ] ) and petrov types * i * , * ii * or * iii * in standard frame requires that @xmath20 , while spacetimes with a @xmath0-term only or vacuum ( @xmath21 ) are ricci semi - symmetric .    for petrov type * d * spacetimes ( with only @xmath22 nonzero ) the conditions both for conformal and for ricci semi - symmetry require all components of @xmath7 to be zero except for @xmath23 .",
    "the conditions for conformal semi - symmetry reduces to @xmath24 and for ricci semi - symmetry to @xmath25 .",
    "spacetimes of segre type a1[(11)(1,1 ) ] are therefore both ricci and conformally semi - symmetric if they conform to @xmath26 with arbitrary @xmath23",
    ". spacetimes with @xmath0-term only are semi - symmetric if once again @xmath26 but only ricci semi - symmetric for other relations between @xmath22 and @xmath0 .    for petrov type * n * spacetimes ( with only @xmath27 nonzero )",
    "the conditions for ricci semi - symmetry as well as for conformal sem - symmetry require all components of @xmath7 to be zero except for @xmath28 .",
    "the conditions here reduces to @xmath29 for conformal semi - symmetry and @xmath30 for ricci semi - symmetry .",
    "they are therefore both ricci and conformally semi - symmetric for arbitrary @xmath27 and @xmath28 as long as @xmath21 .",
    "once again all spacetimes with @xmath0-term only are ricci semi - symmetric .",
    "this is the case not treated by eriksson and senovilla @xcite .",
    "all conformally flat ( petrov type * 0 * ) spacetimes are conformally semi - symmetric .",
    "calculations with classi shows that all conformally flat spacetimes of segre type a1[(11)(1,1 ) ] ( only @xmath23 nonzero ) with @xmath21 are also ricci semi - symmetric .    for conformally flat perfect fluids ( segre type a1[(111),1 ) ] ,",
    "@xmath31 ) as well as for tachyons ( segre type a1[1(11,1 ) ] , @xmath32 ) the condition for ricci semi - symmetry reduces to @xmath33 .",
    "so perfect fluids with @xmath34 as well as tachyons with @xmath35 are also ricci semi - symmetric .",
    "all spacetimes of segre type a3[(11,2 ) ] with @xmath21 ( only @xmath28 nonzero ) are also ricci semi - symmetric .",
    "all conformally flat spacetimes with @xmath0-term only , including flat spacetimes , are ricci semi - symmetric .    for all other segre types the conditions for ricci semi - symmetry are not satisfied .",
    "all conformally flat spacetimes are conformally semi - symmetric , all spacetimes with @xmath0-term only are ricci semi - symmetric .    semi - symmetric spacetimes are flat spacetimes , @xmath0-term and segre a1[(11)(1,1 ) ] spacetimes of petrov type * 0 * and of type * d * with @xmath26 , segre type a3[(11,2 ) ] with @xmath21 of petrov types * n * and * 0 * , as well as conformally flat perfect fluids and tachyons with @xmath36 . for a table see appendix a.",
