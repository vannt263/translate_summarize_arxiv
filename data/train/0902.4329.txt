    "electrical generation of electron spin polarization in non - magnetic semiconductors is a key technology in the development of spintronics  @xcite .",
    "the use of spin - orbit interaction  @xcite enables spin polarization without ferromagnets or external magnetic fields , and a variety of forms of spin filters based on the interaction have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "although most of the proposed devices are technologically feasible , the main obstacle to the experimental verification lies in the detection part . a small ferromagnet attached to the outlet of a spin filter may be used as a polarization detector owing to its spin - dependent transparent coefficients . however , at the semiconductor - metal interface , the polarization generally suffers from conductance mismatch  @xcite and disorder - induced scattering , resulting in low detection efficiency and strong disturbance to the spin source .",
    "it is also obvious that the use of ferromagnets is incompatible with the use of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "therefore , polarization detectors that are made of the host material alone and  quiet \" to the spin source are highly desired .    in this article",
    ", we describe realistic methods to detect spin polarization by using a quantum dot tunnel - coupled to a target ( such as a spin filter ) .",
    "since the dot and the target are connected at only a single point , our methods require no net current to flow through the dot , thus realizing a detector with extremely small disturbance to the target .",
    "these are suitable for the detection of spin polarization not only for delicate spin filters but also for spin hall effect  @xcite . moreover , our methods are quite general and applicable to any system or material in which a few - electron quantum dot can be prepared . as a proof of this principle ,",
    "we present experiments on the polarization detection in magnetic fields utilizing a quantum wire as a controllable spin polarization source .",
    "to perform energy spectroscopy in the side coupled qd .",
    "upper figures show the movement of an energy level in qd in phase with @xmath0 .",
    "( c ) shift of @xmath1 ( upper ) , schematic of @xmath2 ( middle ) , and coulomb oscillations in the transmission probability @xmath3 if we prepare a single electron transistor structure ( lower ) .",
    "the lines in the upper figure show the energy levels of @xmath4 and 3 ground states from left to right .",
    "the energy window is indicated by the gray ( blue ) zone .",
    "( d ) shift of @xmath1 ( upper ) , schematic of @xmath2 with large @xmath5 ( middle ) , and a gray scale plot of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( lower ) .",
    "the lines in the upper figure correspond to the energy of ground , first and second excited levels of @xmath7-electron state from left to right . ]    figure 1(a ) shows the setup of the detector , in which a quantum dot ( qd ) is tunnel - coupled to a target device via a single contact .",
    "the electrostatic potential of qd is detected through the conductance of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) placed on the other side of qd  @xcite .",
    "we first explain how the energy spectrum of qd ( including excited states ) is obtained in this device  @xcite . for the spectroscopy",
    ", the plunger gate voltage @xmath0 on qd is driven to oscillate as a rectangular wave with the amplitude @xmath5 and the center voltage @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath0 shifts the energy levels in qd up and down , and induces shuttling of an electron between qd and the target . when the shuttling is forbidden , the electrostatic potential of qd simply follows the oscillation of @xmath8 and thus the conductance through qpc results in a square wave in phase with @xmath0 .",
    "when the shuttling has a finite probability , an electron injected into qd screens some portions of the variation of the electrostatic potential , and diminishes the oscillation of the conductance .",
    "then the shuttling is detected by the decrease in a lock - in signal @xmath2 of the conductance through qpc in phase with the applied square wave . from the diminishment of the lock - in signal @xmath9",
    ", the information on the energy levels in qd can be extracted .",
    "an analytical approach tells that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the tunneling rate and @xmath12 is the half period of the square wave  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is formally written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the level index , @xmath15 and @xmath1 are the coupling constant and the energy level in qd at injection process ( the period during @xmath16 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is fermi energy of the target device and @xmath18 is the width of the energy window in which the shuttling occurs .",
    "levels satisfying @xmath19 cross @xmath17 by the oscillation with @xmath5 . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath15 is a common constant @xmath20 and @xmath11 becomes @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of levels in the energy window . when @xmath6 is swept , the energy levels in qd cross the energy window and @xmath23 changes with the change of @xmath22 . when @xmath24 is narrower than the energy level spacing , @xmath22 takes the value of 0 or 1 with the change of @xmath6 .",
    "then the energy levels in qd appear as a series of dips in @xmath2 , the positions of which give the energy spectroscopy of the ground states in qd similar to the coulomb oscillation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "if we increase @xmath5 and widen @xmath24 , @xmath22 can be larger than 1 . in this case",
    ", @xmath2 should show stepwise decreases at which excited states come into the window as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) . hence the excitation energy spectra with fixed number of electrons in qd @xmath7 can be obtained from the line shape of @xmath2 versus @xmath6 with a large @xmath5 . here",
    "we assume that the dips are well separated , _",
    "i.e. _ , the charging energy is much larger than energy level spacing between the excited states and multiple occupation of qd is forbidden .     to detect spin polarization .",

    "( c ) scheme of spin polarization detection in high magnetic fields .",

    "the lines in the upper figure correspond to the energy levels of up- and down - spins of @xmath26 state from left to right .",
    "the dotted trace in the lower figure shows the result for @xmath27 . ]",
    "now we move onto the detection of spin polarization .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be the density of states at @xmath17 for up- and down - spins , respectively .",
    "the spin polarization @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 . to detect the polarization , we use two - electron state in qd . due to the pauli principle , the ground state is spin singlet and the excited state is spin triplet .",
    "a way for utilizing this property for polarization detection is to apply the sequence of @xmath0 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "first , @xmath0 is set in @xmath32 region and qd is emptied .",
    "secondly , the first electron is injected and wait time @xmath33 .",
    "finally , @xmath0 is set between the singlet and triplet levels of @xmath25 state .",
    "when we make @xmath34 much longer than the spin relaxation time @xmath35 , the spin state of the first electron is not conserved and both spin states are realized with the probability of 1/2 . then to form spin singlet ,",
    "the tunneling rate of the second electron becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant .",
    "the first term represents the case in which the second electron has up - spin and the second term shows the opposite case . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath34 is much shorter than @xmath35 , the spin state is conserved and the rate is @xmath38 which is equal to or less than @xmath39 .",
    "now @xmath30 can be obtained from the following relation , @xmath40 this equation allows us to evaluate @xmath30 from the measurement of @xmath23 . in another method to detect the change of spin polarization , we utilize the square wave illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are adjusted so that @xmath26 and the singlet level of @xmath25 states are contained in the energy window . at injection phase",
    ", two electrons can be injected into qd .",
    "the tunneling rate of the second electron is again given as @xmath43 here we assume @xmath44 is much shorter than @xmath35 . with the change of @xmath30 , @xmath23 is modified and this results in @xmath9 . especially if @xmath27 ( @xmath45 ) , it vanishes and the injection of the second electron is forbidden . with this technique , we can confirm the change of @xmath30 in spin filters which have controllability with external parameters  @xcite .",
    "the above two schemes work even in zero - magnetic field . under the magnetic field ,",
    "the detection becomes simpler .",
    "we again apply square wave on @xmath0 . by applying magnetic field , the lowest level of @xmath26 state",
    "can accept only an up - spin electron due to the zeeman energy @xmath46 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "when only this state is in the energy window , the rate becomes @xmath47 .",
    "with increasing @xmath6 , the upper zeeman state comes into the energy window and the rate changes to @xmath48 .",
    "the ratio is thus @xmath49 which takes the value from 1/2 to 1 .",
    "the former and the latter correspond to @xmath50 and @xmath27 , respectively . @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained from the two depths @xmath53 and @xmath54 illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig3](c ) ) .",
    "a stepwise drop of @xmath2 due to the first excited orbital also appears .",
    "application of magnetic field parallel to the 2deg causes the zeeman splitting of spin states , which is detected by the drop of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) ) .",
    "note that in this measurement the one dimensional bands in qw are also split by the zeeman effect but @xmath17 is placed far from the band edges and the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath29 can be ignored .",
    "now let us turn to the spin polarization detection .",
    "ideally the conductance of qw under zero magnetic field is quantized in units of @xmath64 , where the factor 2 originates from kramers degeneracy .",
    "this produces staircase - like variation of the conductance through qw @xmath65 versus the width of qw controlled by the wire gate voltage @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "application of the parallel magnetic field lifts the kramers degeneracy and conductance plateaus at odd multiples of @xmath67 appear  @xcite . on such intermediate conductance plateaus",
    ", @xmath17 lies between the two zeeman - separated edges of one - dimensional bands , therefore , @xmath63 and @xmath29 are different . for example , at the lowest conductance plateau , only an up - spin band is occupied ( @xmath27 ) .",

    ". short conductance plateaus ( marked with open triangles ) and long plateaus ( solid triangles ) are observed alternately .",
    "the short and long plateaus correspond to odd ( @xmath76 ) and even ( @xmath77 ) plateaus because the zeeman splitting is smaller than the spacing between one - dimensional bands . here ,",

    "this behavior is qualitatively in accordance with what is expected .",
    "these results certificate that the system is working as a spin polarization detector .",
    "nevertheless , two puzzling points remain .",
    "( 1 ) the region with large @xmath82 at @xmath85 is significantly wider than the width of the conductance plateau .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath82 goes up to 1 even at higher plateau .",
    "if all of the channels have the same contribution on @xmath30 , @xmath30 is represented by @xmath86 .",
    "hence @xmath30 should decrease with increasing @xmath74 .",
    "as for the puzzle ( 1 ) , the reason will be the spatial difference between the position at which @xmath65 is determined and the one at which qd couples to qw . because qw in the present experiment is comparatively short , the electron wave function should be inevitably inhomogeneous along qw .",
    "@xmath65 is determined by the narrowest part of qw while qd detects @xmath30 at the connection point to qw .",
    "the two points are not necessarily same .",
    "lowering of the band edge of higher channel down to @xmath17 may occur at the qd - qw contact before the high channel opens at the narrowest point .",
    "this makes the difference between @xmath82 and @xmath65 around the condition on which a new channel opens .      as for puzzle",
    "( 2 ) , the larger coupling strength between qd and qw for the higher channel will be the reason . to confirm this point",
    ", we check the change of @xmath23 when a new channel in qw opens .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the result .",
    "the measurement is performed in a device with the same design at zero magnetic field .",
    "@xmath23 is normalized by the tunneling rate of the lowest channel @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is an index for channels .",

    "if @xmath89 and 2 channels have the same coupling strength , @xmath88 becomes 2 when both channels open around @xmath87  v as indicated with a horizontal line in fig .",
    "but the observed result is apparently larger than this line and shows that the higher channel has larger coupling .",
    "this originates from the shape of the wave function across qw . in the higher channel",
    ", the wave function of qw is extended to outer side and has larger overlap with the wave function of qd .    in the last part , we emphasize the small detection current needed in this detection scheme .",
    "the net current through qd during the measurement is apparently zero .",
    "the  exchange current \" between the target and qd , defined as @xmath95 , is also extremely small . in the detection in high magnetic field , we use @xmath96  ms . then the exchange current is about 100  aa . for the detection at zero magnetic field , because @xmath35 is the order of ms  @xcite , @xmath44 should be smaller by an order or more .",
    "the exchange current in this case is 1@xmath9710  fa , but still two orders of magnitude smaller than the current for ordinary conductance measurements . from these",
    ", we expect the proposed detector is promising for sensing spin polarization created in delicate mechanisms such as spin filtering by spin - orbit interaction , spin hall effect , etc .    in summary , we proposed realistic methods to detect local spin polarization by using a quantum dot side coupled to a target device . with a quantum wire in magnetic fields as a controllable spin polarized source",
