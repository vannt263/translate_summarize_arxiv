    "random polynomials are popular models in probability theory . they have found a lot of applications in several fields of physics , engineering and economics .",
    "in particular , there is a great variety of problems where the distribution of _ zeros _ of random polynomials occurs , including nuclear physics ( in particular , random matrix theory ) , statistical mechanics or quantum mechanics , to name but a few ; see , e.g. , bharucha - reid and sambandham @xcite or bogomolny , bohigas and lebuf @xcite and references therein .",
    "the most studied classes of random polynomials are the algebraic and trigonometric ensembles . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was rapidly observed that the behaviour of their zeros exhibit important differences .",
    "for instance , both the asymptotic mean and variance of the number of real roots of kac algebraic polynomials are equivalent to @xmath7 , while in the trigonometric case both the asymptotic mean and variance of the number of roots on @xmath8 $ ] are equivalent to @xmath1 , with @xmath1 the degree of the polynomial .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite for precise statements and references .",
    "besides , for algebraic polynomials it often happens that the dominant term in its expansion is solely responsible for the limit ; in contrast , in the trigonometric case generally each term contributes infinitesimally",
    ".    one can find in @xcite several reasons explaining the wide interest of scientists in random trigonometric polynomials .",
    "for instance , in the quantum semiclassical limit one expects to have a large proportion of roots on , or close to , the unit circle in the complex plane . under a certain natural sufficient condition on the coefficients of the random polynomials ( self - invertibility ) ,",
    "the authors were led to consider trigonometric polynomials .",
    "more specifically , throughout this paper we will deal with random trigonometric polynomials of the form @xmath9 where the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 are iid random variables that are normalised so that @xmath12=0 $ ] and @xmath13=1 $ ] .",
    "the problem we want to study is the following : + * question q*. _ fix a small interval containing @xmath14 .",
    "how does the number of zeros of @xmath15 lying in this interval behave as @xmath4 _ ?",
    "+ in order to solve this question , we first have to find the right scale at which a non - degenerate limit may happen .",
    "this leads us to change @xmath16 into @xmath17 and to consider the following normalized version of @xmath15 : @xmath18 we can now investigate the limit of the number of the zeros of @xmath0 lying in any compact interval @xmath3 .",
    "( observe that the factor @xmath19 in ( [ eq : trig - pol ] ) is of course totally useless as far as zeros are concerned ; but since it will play a role when passing to the limit later on , we found convenient to keep it in our definition of @xmath0 . )    in the existing literature , a lot of investigations about the number of zeros of ( [ p_n ] ) concerns the particular case where @xmath20 .",
    "this situation turns out to be more amenable to analysis ; indeed , @xmath15 ( or @xmath0 ) is then gaussian , centered and stationary .",
    "for instance , one can rely on the rice s formula to find that the mean of the number @xmath2 of zeros of @xmath0 within the compact interval @xmath6 converges to @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the length of @xmath6 .",
    "( we recall from the celebrated gaussian rice s formula that , for any centered stationary gaussian process @xmath23 with variance 1 , the mean of the number of zeros within any interval @xmath6 is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 $ ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , even in this gaussian framework the analysis becomes increasingly harder when higher moments are concerned .",
    "for example , a prediction for the limit of the variance of the number of zeros was made in @xcite in 1996 , but it was only a dozen years later that this claim was confirmed by granville and wigman @xcite by combining techniques from probability theory , stochastic processes and harmonic analysis . besides , the authors of @xcite also showed that a central limit theorem ( clt ) for the number of zeros of @xmath0 within @xmath26 $ ] holds .",
    "finally , we would like to conclude this very short picture of the existing results in the case @xmath20 by mentioning the recent paper @xcite by azas and len , in which the authors make use of the wiener chaos techniques to prove , more generally , a clt for the number of crossings of any given level @xmath27 ( see also @xcite for a related study ) .    as we just explained , assuming in ( [ p_n ] ) or ( [ eq : trig - pol ] ) that the coefficients of @xmath0 are gaussian is of great help when dealing with the moments of the number of zeros , as it gives one access to a variety of tools and desirable properties .",
    "in contrast , solving question q when @xmath28 ( that is , in the case where @xmath29 is distributed according to the rademacher distribution ) seems clearly out of reach of existing methods .",
    "however , empirical simulations ( see figure [ fig ] ) suggest that the number @xmath30 of zeros of @xmath0 within any given compact interval @xmath6 exhibits a _ universality phenomenon _ ; this leads us to formulate the natural following conjecture . + * conjecture c*. _ assume that @xmath29 is square integrable with mean zero and unit variance .",
    "then the number of zeros of @xmath0 within any given compact interval @xmath3 converges , as @xmath4 , to the number of zeros of the centered stationary gaussian process admitting the cardinal sine for covariance function , and this .",
    "+ _    [ fig ]     on the interval @xmath31 $ ] , in four situations for the distribution of @xmath29 .",
    "first : rademacher case .",
    "second : uniform case on [ -1,1 ] ( scaled to have variance 1 ) .",
    "third : gaussian case .",
    "fourth : cauchy case .",
    "_ ]    at this stage , it is worth stressing that our universality conjecture concerns the _ local _ behavior of the number of zeros .",
    "indeed , we are interested in the number of zeros of @xmath0 ( not @xmath15 ) on a compact interval @xmath6 ( for instance , @xmath32 $ ] like in figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "another natural problem is to rather consider the _",
    "global _ behavior , by looking this time at the number of zeros of @xmath15 on a compact interval @xmath6 or , equivalently , at the number of zeros of @xmath0 on @xmath33 .",
    "we refer to the recent preprint @xcite by angst and poly , for an analysis of the universality phenomenon for the _ mean _ number of zeros of @xmath0 on the interval @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "let us go back to the present paper .",
    "our main result , theorem [ th ] just below , provides a positive solution to our conjecture c , in the case of _ continuous _ coefficients whose density satisfies some regularity and boundedness conditions .",
    "[ th ] assume in ( [ eq : trig - pol ] ) that @xmath35 are iid square integrable random variables and admit a density @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 , and that @xmath12=0 $ ] and @xmath13=1 $ ] .",
    "assume furthermore that @xmath38 is @xmath39 and satisfies that @xmath40 then , for any compact interval @xmath3 , @xmath41 where , whenever @xmath42 is a process , we denote by @xmath43 the number of zeros of @xmath42 within the interval @xmath6 and where @xmath44 is the centered stationary gaussian process defined on @xmath45 with covariance function @xmath46={\\text{sc}}(t - s):=\\frac{\\sin(t - s)}{t - s}.\\ ] ]    as this stage , we would like to emphasize that the assumption ( [ hypo - densite ] ) is general and actually contains a wide range of densities .",
    "indeed , assume for instance the following two conditions on @xmath38 , that roughly express the fact that @xmath38 diverges at a polynomial speed and that its derivatives have polynomial growths :    * their exist @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for all @xmath49 ; * for each @xmath50 , their exist @xmath51 such that @xmath52",
    ".    then condition ( [ hypo - densite ] ) holds . also , it is worth highlighting that densities of the form @xmath53 appear naturally as invariant measures of diffusions of the form @xmath54",
    "indeed , the infinitesimal generator is @xmath55 .",
    "the heuristic behind theorem [ th ] is pretty simple . using the classical clt ,",
    "it is easy to see that the finite dimensional marginals of @xmath0 converge to those of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , expecting that ( [ cv ] ) holds true looks reasonable .",
    "however , due to the highly non - linear structure of the problem as well as the complexity of the relationships between zeros and coefficients , to transform this intuition into a rigorous theorem is a challenging question . to reach the conclusion of theorem [ th ]",
    ", we will use techniques from two apparently distinct fields , namely rice s formulas ( which have been used extensively to study the zeros of random polynomials ) on one hand and local central limit theorems deduced by malliavin calculus on the other one .",
    "the required smoothness and decay of the finite - dimensional densities of the process involved in the rice s formulas will be obtained by introducing a suitable formalism of integration by parts and will require a long and careful analysis . note that the idea of combining rice and malliavin techniques appeared for the first time in the work by nualart and wschebor @xcite .",
    "let us be a little bit more precise on the technical details , by sketching the route we will follow in order to prove theorem [ th ] .",
    "we will first check in lemma [ prop : det - moments ] that the distribution of @xmath56 is characterised by its moments . as a result , in order to reach the conclusion of theorem [ th ] it will be enough to check that all the moments of @xmath57 converge , as @xmath4 , to the corresponding moments of @xmath56 . for technical reasons , it will be convenient ( as well as equivalent ) to rather prove the convergence of _ factorial _ moments . in other words , we will show that , for all integer @xmath58 , @xmath59}]\\to { \\mathbb e}[z_{w}(i ) ^{[m]}]\\ , \\mbox { as } n\\to\\infty,\\ ] ] where @xmath60}=x(x-1)\\ldots(x - m+1)$ ] .",
    "the proof of ( [ eq : conv - moments ] ) shall be done into two main steps of totally different natures :    1 .",
    "firstly , by means of the rice s formula we will give integral expressions for the factorial moments . to describe these expressions , we need to introduce some notation .",
    "fix an integer @xmath58 and consider , for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , * the set @xmath64 of hyper - diagonals , @xmath65 * the @xmath66-enlargement of @xmath64 , @xmath67 * the random vector @xmath68 * and ( whenever it exists ) the density @xmath69 of @xmath70 at @xmath71 . + corollary [ cor : rice - trunc ] will basically state that , for @xmath1 large enough , @xmath72 } ] = \\int_{i^m\\setminus d^{{\\varepsilon}}_m } \\int_{\\r^m}|y_1|\\ldots |y_m | \\,p_{n,{\\mathbf   t } } ( { \\mathbf   0};{\\mathbf   y } ) d{\\mathbf   y } d{\\mathbf   t}+ o({\\varepsilon}^{1/5}),\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and where the constant involved in the landau notation @xmath74 is uniform with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   secondly , proposition [ prop : conv ] will establish a local limit theorem for the density @xmath75 appearing in . by passing to the limits as @xmath4",
    "( after swaping the limit and the integral by dominated convergence ) and @xmath76 , the conclusion of theorem [ th ] will follow .    throughout all",
    "the paper @xmath77 denotes an unimportant universal constant whose value may change from one occurrence to another .",
    "when a constant depends on some parameter , for example @xmath66 , we shall denote it by @xmath78 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th ] is given in section 2 , whereas section 3 gathers the most technical results .",
    "theorem [ th ] is shown by means of the method of moments .",
    "more precisely , its proof is splitted into two steps :    1 .",
    "section [ s1 ] will first show that the distribution of @xmath56 is determined by its moments .",
    "section [ s2 ] will then show that the ( factorial ) moments of @xmath57 converges to the corresponding moments of @xmath56 .",
    "recall from theorem [ th ] that @xmath44 is the centered stationary gaussian process on @xmath45 admitting the cardinal sine for covariance function .",
    "[ prop : det - moments ] all the moments of @xmath56 are finite .",
    "furthermore , the law of @xmath56 is determined by its moments .",
    "using nualart - wschebor criterion ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.6 , corollary 3.7 ) ) , one has that all the moments of @xmath56 are indeed finite . in order to show that the moments of @xmath56 determine its law",
    ", we use the well - known carleman s condition , that we restate here for convenience .",
    "let @xmath42 be a real - valued random variable . if @xmath79 for all @xmath80 and if @xmath81 then the law of @xmath42 is determined by its moments .",
    "assume that the length @xmath22 of @xmath6 is greater than 1 , otherwise let us bound it by @xmath82",
    ". set @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "using inequality below , we have @xmath85 proposition [ prop : conv ] below implies that @xmath86 is the limit of @xmath87 as @xmath4 . as a consequence , @xmath88 now , if @xmath89 we use the rough bound @xmath90 if @xmath91 , we use the bound @xmath92 hence , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is bounded and decreasing with @xmath95 .",
    "thus , @xmath96 therefore , @xmath97 which is indeed divergent .",
    "the desired result follows .",
    "we start with a basic fact about the non - degeneracy of the finite - dimensional distributions of the process @xmath44 appearing in theorem [ th ] .",
