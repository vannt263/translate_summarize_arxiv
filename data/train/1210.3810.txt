    "common to all types of galaxies  from dwarfs to giant cd galaxies  is a population of globular star clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "studies of the milky way gc population have shown gcs to be among the oldest known stellar populations ( @xmath15 gyr ; @xcite and references therein ) , and as such these objects provide an observable record of the chemical and dynamical history of the galaxy @xcite . as luminous , compact objects ( average @xmath16 , median half light radii @xmath17 pc ; @xcite ) ,",
    "gcs are easily observable out to large distances ( @xmath18 mpc ) and are therefore important probes of galaxy formation and evolution outside the local group ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in recent years",
    ", the gc systems of giant galaxies have been investigated using high - resolution , hierarchical galaxy formation simulations in a cosmological context @xcite .",
    "critical to testing such simulations are accurate measurements of the global properties of galaxy gc systems : total numbers of clusters , specific frequencies , spatial distributions , and color ( metallicity ) distributions .",
    "we have been carrying out a wide - field imaging survey of gc systems of giant spiral , elliptical , and lenticular galaxies outside the local group ( @xmath19 mpc ) .",
    "the survey design is presented in rhode & zepf ( 2001 ; hereafter rz01 ) and previous results are given in rhode & zepf ( 2001 , 2003 , 2004 ; hereafter rz01 , rz03 , rz04 ) , rhode et al .",

    "such measurements  made over a range of host galaxy luminosity , morphology , and environment  provide fundamental observational constraints to galaxy formation models .",
    "studies of the gc systems of moderate - luminosity galaxies in particular ( @xmath20 to @xmath1 ) often lack sufficient spatial coverage to provide directly measured ensemble gc system properties .",
    "giant galaxy gc systems often extend to 50 - 100 kpc from the galaxy center ( @xmath21 to @xmath22 at 15 mpc ) , and therefore wide - field observations are necessary to directly measure these properties and trace gc systems over their full radial extent .",
    "a significant number of galaxy gc systems , covering a wide range in host galaxy luminosity , have been studied with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ; ct et al .",
    "2004 , jordn et al .",
    "2007 , kundu & whitmore 2001a , b ) .",
    "however , the limited spatial coverage of the widest - field _ hst _ instrumentation provides radial coverage of only @xmath23 kpc for galaxies at virgo cluster distances ( @xmath24 for the advanced camera for surveys wide field camera ; acs / wfc ) .",
    "therefore , only lower luminosity galaxies ( @xmath20 or fainter ) will have full radial coverage of their gc systems in studies with _ hst_. in contrast , wide - field imaging studies have typically focused on the most luminous ( @xmath25 or brighter ) galaxies , e.g. , ngc  4472 , ngc  4406 ( rhode & zepf 2001 , 2004 ) ; ngc  1399 ( dirsch et al . 2003 ) ; ngc  1407 ( forbes et al . 2011 ) ; ngc  5128 ( harris et al . 2004 ) ; m87 ( tamura et al . 2006 ) .",
    "consequently , studies of the gc systems of intermediate - luminosity galaxies with adequate spatial coverage remain rare in the literature .",
    "this paper presents the results of wide - field imaging study of the gc systems of five intermediate - luminosity ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) early - type galaxies : one elliptical and four lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies .",

    "the galaxies have been chosen both to increase the number of moderate - luminosity galaxies with well measured global gc system properties and to fill in existing gaps in our survey .",
    "in particular , this study doubles the number of s0 galaxies in the survey , resulting in comparable numbers of spiral , elliptical , and s0s in the sample .",
    "hargis & rhode ( 2013 , in preparation ) will present a multivariate analysis that will include the five galaxies in this study as well as the @xmath26 other galaxies analyzed for the survey to date .",

    "the images of four of the target galaxies ( ngc  5866 , ngc  5813 , ngc  4762 , ngc  4754 ) were taken over five nights in may 2010 .",
    "ngc  3384 was imaged in march 1999 as part of a study of the gc systems of four e / s0 galaxies ( rz04 ) . for each galaxy",
    ", we obtained several images in each of three broadband filters ( @xmath2 ) , dithering between exposures to facilitate cosmic ray rejection and provide sky coverage across the ccd chip gaps .",

    "the images of ngc  3379 from rz04 also include ngc  3384 because the galaxies have an angular separation of @xmath38 .",
    "we used the reduced images of the ngc  3379/3384 field from rz04 for our analysis of ngc  3384 .",

    ".    the observation dates , exposure times , and number of exposures used in our final , stacked image for each target are listed in table  [ tbl_observations ] . during the may 2010 observing run , night two was photometric .",
    "the remaining nights were non - photometric but generally clear with occasional clouds on some nights . in order to postcalibrate the data taken on the non - photometric nights",
    ", we obtained shorter single exposures of each target in each filter ( exposure times of 600 s ) and images of @xcite standard fields on the photometric night . using these we derived a photometric calibration solution consisting of color coefficients and zero points . for the march 1999 observing run , the ngc  3379/3384 data were taken under non - photometric conditions and postcalibrated using additional observations as detailed in rz04 .",
    "the data were reduced using the mscred routines in iraf .",
    "the data were first processed using ` ccdproc ` , applying the overscan and bias level corrections .",
    "flat fielding was done using master dome flats and median - smoothed master twilight flats .",
    "the individual mosaic extensions were then combined into a single fits image using the ` msczero ` , ` msccmatch ` , and ` mscimage ` routines .",
    "we next measured and subtracted a constant sky background level from each image . where smooth sky background gradients were present we used the ` imsurfit ` routine to fit and subtract a 2nd - order polynomial surface from the background , having first masked the chip gaps , stars , and target galaxies to obtain an accurate measure of the background variations .",
    "lastly , the series of images for each filter were scaled to a common flux level by measuring @xmath39 bright stars on each image . in each filter , the images for a particular target galaxy were aligned and a single stacked image was created using ` mscstack ` with ` ccdclip ` pixel rejection and no zero point offsets or additional scaling .",
    "the mean background level of the image used as the flux scaling reference frame was added back to the stacked image .",
    "the range of the mean full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the image point - spread functions ( psfs ) for the final images is as follows : @xmath40 to @xmath41 for ngc  5866 , @xmath42 to @xmath41 for ngc  5813 , @xmath41 to @xmath43 for ngc  4762/4754 , and @xmath44 to @xmath43 for ngc  3384 .",
    "in order to detect the gc systems of the target galaxies , we use the procedures developed in our previous wide - field imaging studies . we create a galaxy - subtracted image by smoothing the final combined image , subtracting it from the original , and restoring the constant sky background level .",
    "all subsequent steps in the analysis were performed on these galaxy - subtracted images .",
    "we detected all sources on the images using the ` daofind ` routine in iraf with @xmath45 to @xmath46 detection thresholds in each of the three filters .",
    "regions of the image which contained saturated pixels ( due to bleed trails from bright stars ) or high noise levels ( along the frame edges or near the centers of the host galaxy ) were masked out .",
    "the source lists in each filter were matched to proudce a final source list per field .",
    "the total numbers of detected objects in @xmath2 are 3858 for ngc  5866 , 10207 for ngc  5813 , 4903 for ngc  4762/4754 , and 3224 for the ngc  3384/3379 field .    because gcs at the distances of the target galaxies will be point sources in our images , we removed extended sources from our list of detected objects .",
    "we used a graphical software routine to select the sequence of point sources in a plot of object fwhm versus instrumental magnitude , accounting for the increasing scatter at faint magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig_escut ] shows an example of the point source selection for ngc  5866 . after requiring",
    "that objects pass the point source criteria in each of the @xmath2 filters , we are left with the following number of point sources for the target galaxies : 1551 for ngc  5866 , 5709 for ngc  5813 , 2167 for ngc  4762/4754 , and 1728 for the ngc  3384/3379 field .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the point source objects in order to obtain calibrated magnitudes . here",
    "we describe the calibration procedures for the may 2010 mosaic data .",
    "the photometry and calibration for the ngc  3384/3379 data was performed in a similar manner ; the relevant details can be found in rz04 section 3.3 .",
    "we measured the point source objects using @xmath47 apertures and applied aperture corrections to obtain total magnitudes .",
    "the aperture corrections were determined using the mean difference between the total magnitude and the magnitude within an aperture of @xmath47 for @xmath48 bright stars on the images .",
    "the aperture corrections ranged from -0.443 to -0.222 with errors of 0.001 to 0.004 . because the final @xmath2 science images and the photometric calibration data were taken on different nights ( see section [ sec_observations ] ) , we determined bootstrap offsets to the instrumental magnitudes of the photometric night .",
    "these offsets were determined using the final science images and the series of shorter exposure images taken on the photometric night .",
    "the bootstrap offsets ranged from -0.406 to -0.007 with errors of 0.002 to 0.008 .",
    "the final calibrated magnitudes were calculated by applying the aperture corrections , atmospheric extinction corrections , and bootstrap offsets to the instrumental magnitudes determined using a photometric aperture with a radius of @xmath47 . finally , we corrected the calibrated magnitudes for galactic extinction using the reddening maps of @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl_targets ] lists @xmath49 for the target galaxies . for the ngc  4762/4754 field",
    ", we used the extinction corrections for the center of the frame for both galaxies .",
    "the difference in extinction across the field ranged from only 0.01 - 0.02 magnitudes , and therefore has a negligible impact on our selection of gc candidates .",
    "our list of gc candidates is determined by selecting objects from our point source list that have magnitudes and @xmath2 colors consistent with those of gcs at the distances of the target galaxies .",
    "we adopt the same selection procedures used in our previous gc system studies and here only summarize the steps described in detail in rz01 .",
    "we assume a range of gc absolute magnitudes based on observations of the milky way gc luminosity function ( gclf ) and other well - studied nearby galaxies ( @xmath50 ; ashman & zepf 1998 ) .",
    "we select as gc candidates those point sources that have @xmath51 and @xmath52 colors consistent with the milky way gcs but extend the range of allowed metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath53 to @xmath54 ) .",
    "lastly , we also consider the likelihood of a point source being a gc by examining the appearance of objects in _ hst _ imaging ( see section  [ sec_hst ] ) and their radial distance from the galaxy center .    figures  [ n5866_bvr]-[n3384_bvr ] show the locations of the point sources in the @xmath2 color - color plane .",
    "because contamination from unresolved background galaxies is problematic in selecting gc candidates from ground - based imaging studies , we illustrate the expected colors of galaxies of various morphological types from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( see rz01 for details ) . the color selection process was performed for each galaxy as follows .",
    "first , we removed any point sources brighter than the brightest expected gc at the distance of the galaxy ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "second , because the faintest point sources will have large photometric errors , we applied a faint - end magnitude cut to keep only those gc candidates with magnitude errors in all filters @xmath58 mag ( color errors @xmath59 mag ) .",
    "this cut ensures we keep only the most well - measured gc candidates and , because the number of background galaxies grows at fainter magnitudes , this also reduces contamination .",
    "because such a cut could eliminate faint but _ bona fide _ gcs , we examined the spatial distribution of the objects being cut to ensure a lack of spatial concentration of objects around the galaxy center .",
    "we note also that this magnitude cut is accounted for in our correction for magnitude incompleteness by the fitting of the gclfs ( see section  [ sec_gclf ] ) .",
    "third , we selected as gc candidates those remaining point sources which have colors ( including photometric errors ) within @xmath60 of the milky way @xmath2 color - color relation , expanded to include metallicities from [ fe / h ] = @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "we examined in detail objects near the galaxy center which only barely fail the selection criteria , ensuring we did not miss objects which should be included in our final gc candidate lists .",
    "lastly , we removed any objects from our gc candidate list which are likely background galaxies as determined from our analysis of archival _ hst _ images ( see section  [ sec_background ] ) .    for the ngc  4762/4754 field ,",
    "the color selection procedure required additional steps .",
    "for ngc  4762 , we masked a region around ngc  4754 in order to eliminate gc candidates likely associated with this galaxy .",
    "we removed any gc candidates within a @xmath61 radius of ngc  4754 , having estimated the spatial extent of the galaxy s gc system using a radial surface density profile of gc candidates ( see section  [ sec_asymp ] ) .",
    "for ngc  4754 we applied the same masking procedures , removing all gc candidates within a @xmath62 radius of ngc  4762 from the ngc  4754 gc candidate list .",
    "lastly , because the galaxies were imaged together , we adopted a single faint - end magnitude cut ( based on the photometric errors ) for both galaxies .",
    "we used slightly different bright - end magnitude cuts due to the differing distances of the galaxies .",
    "figures  [ n4762_bvr ] and  [ n4754_bvr ] show the resulting color - color diagrams .",
    "the magnitude and color cuts have been applied across the entire field ; no spatial / radial cuts have been applied other than the respective galaxy masks .",
    "therefore , because of the large field of view of the mosaic images @xmath63 , the final gc candidate lists for both galaxies contained objects in common .    for ngc  3384 , the color selection followed the same procedure described for ngc  3379 in rz04 .",
    "the very shallow depth of the @xmath64 image means the detected objects in all three filters are preferentially blue .",
    "thus the overdensity of gc candidates in the color - color plane was markedly skewed toward the blue side of the mean milky way @xmath2 gc relation . to pick up all the objects in the overdensity",
    ", we used a @xmath65 width on the red side of the selection box and a @xmath60 width on the blue side of the box .",
    "in addition , we masked the gc system of ngc  3379 in our determination of the ngc  3384 gc candidates .",
    "we eliminated all gc candidates with a @xmath66 radius of ngc  3379 , adopting a mask size that extends to the radius where the final , corrected radial surface density profile is first consistent with zero within the errors ( rz04 ) .",
    "after applying the color and magnitude selection steps , the final number of gc candidates for the target galaxies are as follows : 290 for ngc  5866 , 1300 for ngc  5813 , 481 for ngc  4762 , 451 for ngc  4754 , and 181 for ngc  3384 .",
    "the point source detection and magnitude completeness limits were measured using a series of artificial star tests on the @xmath2 sciences images .",
    "we first computed a model psf for each image derived from the best - fit average psf of the frame . in a single test",
    ", we added 600 artificial stars to the image with magnitudes which vary around 0.2 mag of a specific value .",
    "we next applied the identical point source detection criteria used to detect each galaxy s gc system ( see section  [ sec_ptsource ] ) and computed the fraction of detected artificial stars .",
    "we ran the tests over a 4 - 5 magnitude range and thus obtained a measure of the completeness ( fraction of detected point sources ) as a function of magnitude in each filter .",
    "table  [ tbl_completeness ] lists the 90% and 50% completeness limits for the galaxies in this study .",
    "the gc system detection process ( see section  [ sec_detection ] ) significantly reduces contamination in our gc candidate lists from bright galactic foreground stars , spatially - extended background galaxies , and objects with colors inconsistent with those of confirmed gcs and their range of metallicities .",
    "even so , our gc candidate lists contain some degree of contamination .",
    "below we discuss how we quantify the remaining contamination in the gc candidate samples .",
    "the large spatial coverage obtained with the mosaic camera provides a means of directly quantifying the level of contamination without additional pointings and/or control fields .",
    "wide - field imaging studies of extragalactic gc systems typically show a centrally - concentrated profile when plotting the azimuthally averaged surface density of gc candidates as a function of projected radius from the host galaxy center . assuming the spatial profile of the gc system is not larger than the imaging area , the radial profile decreases smoothly to a mean background level . because at large projected radii very few _ bona fide _ gc will be present ( as evidenced by the decreasing radial profile ) , the population will be dominated by contaminating foreground galactic stars and background galaxies . measuring the mean surface density ( over a large area ) at large projected radii from the host galaxy center thus provides a direct empirical estimate of our sample contamination .",
    "the radial surface density profiles can then be corrected for contamination by subtracting the measured asymptotic surface density of contaminants .",
    "we constructed radial surface density profiles for the target galaxies and measured the asymptotic contamination values as detailed below . in all cases we used circular annuli and explored the effects of choices of bins sizes and bin center locations on the shape of the radial profile .",
    "we accounted for missing area in the bins ( due to masked regions or bins which extend off the images ) by using the  effective area \" , i.e. , calculating the area of unmasked pixels . after adopting a contamination estimate",
    ", we computed the radially - dependent contamination fraction as the ratio of the number of contaminating objects in the bin ( surface density of contaminants multiplied by the effective area of the bin ) to the total number of gc candidates in the bin .",
    "we describe the initial radial profiles and asymptotic contamination estimates for each galaxy below .",
    "_ ngc  5866_.  we constructed the radial profile using bins with @xmath67 spacing .",
    "given the relatively small number of gc candidates for this galaxy ( @xmath68 ) spread over the entire mosaic frame , our experiments with various radial bin widths indicated that wider bins were necessary to ensure a significant number of gc candidates per bin and produce a smooth radial profile .",
    "the region inward of @xmath69 was masked due to the poorer quality of the @xmath64 band imaging , so the bin centers ranged from @xmath70 from the galaxy center to @xmath71 .",
    "the surface density falls to a nearly constant level in the bins outward of @xmath72 , indicating that we have observed the full radial extent of the gc system .",
    "we computed the asymptotic contamination correction as the weighted mean of the surface density in the five radial bins from @xmath73 , finding a value of @xmath74 ( assuming poisson statistics ) .",
    "_ ngc  5813_.  we constructed the radial profile using bins with @xmath70 spacing .",
    "the region inward of @xmath75 is masked , so the radial bins ranged from @xmath76 from the galaxy center to @xmath77 .",
    "the surface density decreases smoothly to a nearly constant level starting at the @xmath78 bin but shows some small fluctuations between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the surface density decreased smoothly from the galaxy center , falling to a nearly constant level at the @xmath85 bin . to avoid possible contribution from the ngc  4754 gc system , we measured the contamination using the area outside the gc systems of both galaxies . using a single large radial bin with an inner edge at @xmath86 and extending to @xmath84",
    ", we find a surface density of contaminants of @xmath87 ( assuming poisson statistics ) .",

    "the profile decreased smoothly to a nearly constant level at the @xmath91 radial bin . because the gc candidate list for ngc  4754 differs from ngc  4762 ( due to the different bright - end magnitude cuts )",
    ", we can not use the ngc  4762 contamination estimate .",
    "we avoid any contribution from the ngc  4762 gc system by using a single large radial bin outside the radial extent of both gc systems . using one bin with an inner edge at @xmath92 and extending to @xmath84 , we find a surface density of contaminants of @xmath87 ( assuming poisson statistics ) , consistent with the contamination estimate for ngc  4762 .",
    "_ ngc  3384_.  we constructed the initial radial profile using bins with @xmath70 spacing ranging from @xmath93 ( inner edge of innermost bin ) to @xmath94 ( outer edge of outermost bin ) .",
    "the profile shows a smooth decrease to a nearly constant level at the @xmath95 radial bin .",
    "the surface density profile showed a very slight but insignificant increase above the errors in the @xmath96 radial bin .",
    "we calculated an asymptotic contamination surface density of @xmath97 ( assuming poisson statistics ) using the nine radial bins from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , adopting the weighted mean of the surface density in these bins as our final value .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the asymptotic contamination surface density estimate for ngc  3379 of @xmath100 from rz04 .",
    "a primary source of contamination in our wide - field imaging studies are foreground galactic stars ( predominately in the halo ) that have magnitudes and colors that pass the gc selection criteria .",
    "we can estimate the degree of this contamination and compare the results to our measured asymptotic contamination levels using galactic star count models .",
    "we used the besanon galactic stellar population synthesis models of @xcite to predict the number counts of milky way stars in our observed fields .",
    "briefly , the besanon models produce a four component structural model of the galaxy ( thin disk , thick disk , spheroid , bulge ) using stellar evolution tracks , initial mass functions ( imfs ) , age ranges , and metallicities for each stellar population . the simulations output a catalog of stars which pass the user - defined magnitude range(s ) , color range(s ) , and area on the sky .    for each galaxy",
    ", we use the besanon models estimate the surface density of galactic stars which pass our bright and faint @xmath101 magnitude cuts , @xmath51 and @xmath52 color cuts , and cover the identical area of sky of our mosaic fields .",
    "because the models employ monte carlo methods to generate the stellar populations , we run the simulations ten times for each galaxy and use the mean and standard deviation of the ten runs to estimate the total number of contaminating stars .",
    "we show an example simulation and color selection for ngc  5866 in figure  [ besancon_galactic ] , plotting the @xmath2 colors of simulated stars which fall in the magnitude range of the ngc  5866 gc candidates over the area of the mosaic pointing . comparing the simulation to the ngc",
    "5866 observations ( figure  [ n5866_bvr ] ) shows the effect of photometric uncertainties in our observations .",
    "the besanon estimates of the foreground galactic contamination for the six target galaxies are as follows : @xmath102 for ngc  5866 , @xmath103 for ngc  5813 , @xmath104 for ngc  4762 , @xmath104 for ngc  4754 , and @xmath105 for ngc  3384 .",
    "the typical uncertainty ( standard deviation ) in the surface density was @xmath106 .",
    "for all galaxies , the simulated galactic contamination estimates are lower than the values derived from observations ( using the asymptotic behavior of the radial profile ; see section  [ sec_asymp ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that the additional source of contamination comes from unresolved background galaxies .      because of the superior spatial resolution provided by _",
    "hst _ relative to our ground - based imaging , gc candidates that are unresolved in mosaic data may be resolved as background galaxies when imaged by _",
