    "baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite and the idea of unification of particle and forces @xcite are the two global concepts that motivated the nucleon decay experimental searches @xcite for more than two decades .",
    "the particular modes of nucleon decay are not known a priori , although some are preferred by theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the results from several generations of nucleon decay search experiments @xcite , including the most spectacular recent super - kamiokande results @xcite , have set stringent limits on many exclusive nucleon decay modes .",
    "for example , the lifetime limit for the decay mode @xmath2 , established by the super - k collaboration , reaches @xmath3 years @xcite . however , the mode - independent nucleon lifetime limit @xcite is established experimentally only at the level of @xmath4 years @xcite , which is more than 8 orders of magnitude poorer than the previous limit .",
    "that indicates that experimental searches for certain decay modes need to be extended .",
    "the particle data group identifies 75 possible modes of nucleon decay ( baryon instability ) @xcite that respect the conservation laws of electric charge , energy - momentum , and angular momentum .",
    "the lifetime limits for most of these modes lie above @xmath5 years , but there are a few significant exceptions .",
    "these are the modes corresponding to the decay of one neutron or two neutrons into neutrinos : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "lifetime limits for these modes are several orders of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , these modes can be interpreted as disappearance of one or two neutrons from their intra - nucleus state into any undetectable particles . following the spirit of the paper of evans and steinberg @xcite and using the assumptions of the conservation laws mentioned above",
    ", one could think that the present `` mode - independent '' nucleon decay limit @xcite is determined by these neutron disappearance modes .",
    "we believe that experimental searches for these modes and the improvement of mode - independent nucleon lifetime limit are as fundamentally important as searches for particular exclusive nucleon decay modes with super - giant detectors .",
    "moreover , decays like @xmath9 arise in certain unification schemes @xcite as a result of @xmath10 non - conserving interactions that might be more natural for the explanation of baryon asymmetry of universe than @xmath10-conserving transitions .",
    "the question of whether @xmath10 is violated in nature and at what energy scale can be answered only by experiments @xcite .",
    "nucleon decay into five and more leptons was theoretically considered in @xcite ; dinucleon decay into two leptons in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the disappearance of a neutron ( or two neutrons ) from its intra - nucleus state creates subsequent nuclear de - excitations that , for a few particular de - excitation modes , would lead to a unique experimental signature : _ a chain of time- and space - correlated events_. such a signature can be observed in the modern large - mass , low - background , and low - threshold detectors , e.g. , in kamland @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the sensitivity of a search for such events in the kamland detector will result in improvement of one - neutron and two - neutron disappearance limits by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude beyond the existing lifetime limits .",
    "the idea that nucleon decay in the nucleus can be studied by measuring particles and/or @xmath11 rays accompanied by de - excitation of the nucleon hole was , to our knowledge , first considered by y. totsuka @xcite and h. ejiri @xcite and used by the kamiokande collaboration @xcite as discussed below .",
    "also , recently the dama collaboration @xcite has searched in 6.5 kg of a liquid @xmath12xe scintillator detector operating in gran sasso national laboratory for the decay products of the residual radioactive daughter nuclei left after the disappearance of one or two nucleons from a @xmath12xe nucleus and set new limits for two - nucleon disappearance .    in section [ sect2 ] of this paper",
    ", we discuss the existing experimental limits for @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and , in general , for disappearance of one or two neutrons . our calculations for de - excitation branching ratios in intra - nucleus disappearance of one neutron from @xmath0c are discussed in section [ sect3 ] ; for comparison , in section [ osect ] , we also calculated the disappearance of a neutron from an @xmath13o nucleus ; section [ sect4 ] deals with the calculations of de - excitation modes following the two - neutron disappearance from @xmath0c .",
    "the possible observation of some particular de - excitation modes followed by the radioactive decay of daughter nuclei in the kamland detector , as well as the possible sources of background , are discussed in section [ discuss ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conclude ] .",
    "experimental limits have been set for @xmath6 decay in underground experiments @xcite assuming that the whole earth is the source of decaying neutrons . the underground detectors in this case",
    "measure the specific energy spectrum above the background level of atmospheric neutrino signals , resulting from decay - neutrinos interactions with the material of the detector .",
    "the best limit set from the analysis of the muon events induced by charge - current @xmath14 interactions in the detector @xcite was @xmath15 years .",
    "the best limit from @xmath16 interactions was set in @xcite as @xmath17 years . due to the detection method",
    ", these limits are only valid for the specific decay of a neutron into particular types of neutrinos and can not generally be applied to the neutron disappearance .",
    "a very inspirational approach has been used by the kamiokande collaboration @xcite who set the limit for @xmath18 decay of @xmath19 years , independent of the type of neutrinos emitted in the neutron decay . by virtue of the experimental method ,",
    "this limit is also relevant for intra - nucleus neutron disappearance .",
    "the method is based on the detection of @xmath11-rays , which could be residual de - excitation products of a highly excited @xmath20o nucleus left after the disappearance of a neutron from @xmath13o in the low - background energy range between 19 and 50 mev .",
    "because of the similarity to our approach , we are discussing this method below in more detail . in this",
    "regard we also refer to the paper by h.  ejiri @xcite .",
    "when a neutron disappears from the oxygen nucleus , the residual @xmath20o is often left in an excited state . in the nuclear shell model the excitation level is determined by the level that a neutron has inside the @xmath13o and by the width of this energy level ( spreading width ) . in the @xmath13o nucleus , two neutrons occupy the lowest @xmath21 level , 4 neutrons fill the next @xmath22 shell , and the remaining 2 neutrons populate the highest @xmath23 state .",
    "the disappearance of a neutron from the @xmath23 state would result in a minimal excitation where the residual @xmath20o with high probability will be left in the ground state and the difference of the binding energy will be taken care of by undetected neutron decay products .",
    "the disappearance of a neutron from a lower @xmath22 state will create a hole that will result in a restructuring of the residual nucleus with possible emission of @xmath11 radiation .",
    "thus , it was estimated in @xcite that de - excitation of the @xmath22 neutron hole with a probability of @xmath24 44% will produce 6.18 mev @xmath11-rays . the remaining part the @xmath20o nucleus",
    "will again be left in the ground state .",
    "when a disappearing neutron produces a hole in the @xmath21 shell , the excitation energy is large enough to exceed the separation energy for protons and neutrons in @xmath20o . in this case de - excitation proceeds mainly by emission of a proton , neutron , @xmath25 , and , to a smaller extent , by emission of @xmath11s . since the kamiokande water - herenkov detector was not sensitive to low - energy protons , neutrons , @xmath25s , and had a threshold for @xmath11 and electron detection of 7.5 mev , the authors of paper @xcite concentrated only on the probability of de - excitation of the @xmath21-state hole via emission of @xmath11s within an energy range of 19 - 50 mev , where the experimental background was very small .",
    "this resulted in a rather small de - excitation branching ratio ( br ) estimated in @xcite as @xmath26 . due to this small branching ratio",
    ", the measured @xmath27 years in the kamiokande detector has resulted in @xmath28 disappearance limit of only @xmath29 years .    for completeness , we need to mention that the particle data group listings @xcite also include the @xmath6 and @xmath7 lifetime limits of the j .- f .",
    "glicenstein analysis @xcite @xmath30 years and @xmath31 years , based on the kamiokande experimental data and on the idea that the disappearance of the neutron s magnetic moment should produce radiation .",
    "existing lifetime experimental limits for @xmath8 are even less stringent .",
    "the following two limits were determined by the frjus collaboration @xcite : @xmath32 years and @xmath33 years .",
    "these limits assume two - neutron decays into neutrinos and antineutrinos of _ e _ and _ @xmath34 _ flavors rather than the more general intra - nucleus disappearance of two neutrons . recently the dama collaboration @xcite , looking for the de - excitation products of the residual radioactive daughter nuclei left after the two - neutron disappearance from a @xmath12xe , has set the lower limit for @xmath8 ( more generally for two - neutron disappearance ) as @xmath35 years .",
    "large liquid scintillator detectors like kamland @xcite and borexino @xcite contain @xmath0c as a major component of the detector material . in the simple nuclear shell - model picture the @xmath0c ground state",
    "is described as a closed - shell nucleus i.e. , for both protons and neutrons the lowest - lying @xmath21 and @xmath22 shells are completely filled , while all higher ( sub)shells are empty .",
    "this occupation of the nuclear energy levels by neutrons is sketched in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , most of the neutrons available in liquid scintillator detectors for the baryon instability search are the neutrons occupying @xmath21 and @xmath22 energy levels in @xmath0c .",
    "occupation of energy levels by neutrons for the @xmath0c ground state in a simple shell model picture .",
    "one neutron is shown as disappeared from @xmath21 level.,width=288 ]      if , in the simple shell - model picture , a neutron disappears from the @xmath22 shell in @xmath0c , the residual @xmath36c nucleus is always left in the ground state .",
    "however , in more sophisticated shell - model calculations , it has been shown that the simple closed - shell picture of the @xmath0c ground state has to be remedied . due to correlations , especially pairing effects , the @xmath23 shell is also partially filled with protons and neutrons from the @xmath22 level lying just 4.44 mev below ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "various shell - model calculations @xcite give partial occupation numbers of the @xmath23 shell for both neutrons and protons in the range 0.75@xmath370.8 , corresponding to an average filling of the @xmath22 shell between 3.2 and 3.25 .",
    "if we interpret the partial occupations by saying that approximately 60 percent of the time the @xmath22 shell is completely filled , while roughly 40 percent of the time two neutrons ( the same for a proton pair ) are in the @xmath23 shell , then there is a finite probability that a neutron disappearing from the @xmath22 state will leave the residual @xmath36c nucleus in an excited state with spin and parity @xmath38 .",
    "there is only one state in @xmath36c with @xmath38 below 10 mev  @xcite , which is the first excited state at 2.0 mev .",
    "therefore , we assume that this is the only possible final state when a @xmath22 neutron disappears , while at the same time a pair of neutrons is in the @xmath23 shell , i.e. , we assume the corresponding spectroscopic factor to be 1 .",
    "then the probability per p - shell neutron for this event is given by the product of 40 percent and 1/2 , that is 20 percent , with an adopted error of @xmath39 % .",
    "the first excited state in @xmath36c will promptly de - excite by emission of a @xmath11 with an energy of 2.0 mev , and the ground state of @xmath36c will subsequently undergo a @xmath1 transition ( the half - lifetime of @xmath36c is 20.4 min and q@xmath40 = 1.98 mev ) .",
    "thus , the disappearance of a neutron from the @xmath22 state will result , with a branching of 20@xmath415% per each of four p - shell neutrons , in two time - correlated events : emission of monoenergetic 2.0 mev @xmath11 and @xmath1 emission with detectable energy in the range 1.021.98 mev .",
    "a more complicated and rich picture emerges if a neutron disappears from the @xmath21 state in @xmath0c .",
    "excitation energy of the residual @xmath36c@xmath42 in this case is very high ; it exceeds the separation energy for proton , neutron , and @xmath25 particles in @xmath36c , making them the primary emission products of the highly excited nucleus .",
    "qualitatively , emission of a proton should be more frequent than emission of a neutron , since @xmath36c is a proton - rich nucleus",
    ". primary emission might not be sufficient for removing all the excitation energy and therefore might be followed by secondary de - excitation .",
    "nuclear model calculations are needed in order to estimate these particular de - excitation branching ratios .",
    "the residual @xmath36c nucleus is left in a highly excited state with ( assuming conservation of angular momentum and parity ) total spin and parity @xmath43 .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath44 of this state can be calculated by the difference between the binding energy of the @xmath21 neutron level in @xmath0c and the neutron separation energy of @xmath0c .",
    "while the latter is well known to be @xmath45  mev , no precise experimental or theoretical values exist for the binding energy of the @xmath21 neutron level . in the case of the @xmath21 proton level in @xmath0c",
    "the binding energy and the width have been measured in several electron scattering experiments @xmath0c(@xmath46p ) @xcite and were determined to be @xmath47  mev and @xmath48  mev , respectively .",
    "correcting @xmath49 for the coulomb shift of @xmath50  mev for protons in @xmath0c gives us @xmath51=41.7 @xmath41 1  mev for the binding energy of the @xmath21 neutron level in @xmath0c and , subtracting the neutron separation energy , we get the value @xmath52  mev for the excitation energy in @xmath36c . determination of width of the excited state caused by the disappearance of @xmath21 nucleon is not that straightforward . in terms of nuclear correlations that are responsible for the width of the excited state ,",
    "the disappearance of nucleon a priori is not the same process as the knocking - out of a nucleon , since in the latter case a strongly - interacting particle remains present in the final state inside the nuclear matter .",
    "different approaches are possible here .",
    "theoretical estimates for the spreading width of the @xmath21 hole in infinite nuclear matter @xcite gives a value of @xmath246 mev . as another extreme",
    "one can use the spreading width of @xmath21 state as determined in proton knock - out exeriments @xcite .",
    "we adopt what we think is a reasonable compromise here and assumed that the excited level at @xmath52  mev in @xmath36c has a lorentzian width of @xmath53  mev . at the end of the section",
    "we will show that our main results do not sensitively depend on the values adopted for @xmath44 and @xmath54 in the whole range of variations mentioned above .    in order to determine the de - excitation modes of the excited @xmath36c nucleus , i.e. , the branching ratios in the various particle emission channels and the energy spectra of the emitted particles",
    ", we used the statistical model of compound nuclear reactions ( hauser - feshbach ) @xcite . within this model the branching ratio for the decay @xmath55 of an excited state of a nucleus @xmath56 with energy @xmath57 and spin and parity @xmath58 to a final nucleus @xmath59 by emission of a particle @xmath60 is given by the ratio of the transmission coefficients : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is simply the sum of the transmission coefficients of all decay channels open at @xmath57 : @xmath63 which guarantees that the sum of the branching ratios is normalized to one .",
    "each of the transmission coefficients @xmath64 is obtained by adding the contributions from all allowed final states in the residual nucleus : @xmath65 in this sum the decays to the ground state ( @xmath66 ) and all experimentally known excited levels ( @xmath67,@xmath68 ) in the daughter - nucleus are explicitely taken into account . for excitation energies higher than the energy @xmath69 of the last known level",
    "the sum is changed to an integration over the level density @xmath70 up to the highest energetically allowed state at energy @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the channel separation energy for the ejected particle @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen , that the important ingredients of statistical model calculations are the particle and @xmath11-transmission coefficients @xmath73 and the level density of the excited states .",
    "therefore , the quality of the calculated results within the statistical model is determined by the accuracy with which these components can be evaluated .    the branching ratios and particle energy spectra we present in the following",
    "have been calculated with the statistical model code smoker @xcite , which applies realistic optical potentials ( reproducing nicely experimental data ) to determine the transmission coefficients and a sophisticated description for the level density ( by a combination of a constant temperature formula and a back - shifted fermi gas ) .",
    "starting from an excited state with well - defined energy , angular momentum , and parity , the smoker program calculates the branching ratios for transitions via photon , neutron , proton , and @xmath25 emission , which are the dominant de - excitation channels .",
    "note that within smoker the transmission coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ tcoff ] ) describing the transition from the excited state ( @xmath74 ) to the state ( @xmath75 ) in the daughter nucleus are correctly obtained by summing up the contributions from all quantum mechanically allowed partial waves :    @xmath76    here angular momentum @xmath77 and the channel spin @xmath78 couple to @xmath79 . for the physical quantities typically needed in statistical model calculations ( e.g. , nuclear masses , level density parameters ) , smoker takes the experimental values , if they exist .",
    "otherwise , theoretical models are applied .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , where the branching ratios for the decay of an excited state of @xmath36c@xmath42 with spin and parity @xmath43 into the photon , neutron , proton , and @xmath25 channels are shown as functions of excitation energy .",
    "note that all particle decay channels open at the correct thresholds ( @xmath80  mev , @xmath81  mev , @xmath82  mev ) because the experimental masses of the involved nuclei have been used . with increasing excitation energy ,",
    "as soon as a hadronic decay channel opens , the branching for @xmath11-decay ( electro - magnetic interaction ) becomes negligible .",
    "while the contribution to the neutron channel rises immediately after the threshold , the branching into the proton channel needs 2 - 3 mev above the threshold to become open because the coulomb barrier has to be overcome .",
    "if particle emission decay leads to an excited level of the residual nucleus , we again calculate the branching ratios for the subsequent emission with the statistical model ( iteration of smoker ) . by keeping track of the energies of the ejected particles and photons during the cascade , and by weighting them with the corresponding branching ratios , the energy spectra for emitted neutrons , protons , @xmath25s , and @xmath11s can be determined .",
    "since the amount of excitation energy in the system is significantly reduced with every particle emission and eventually drops below the particle emission thresholds , we found that the cascade could practically be terminated after two emission steps , i.e. , the residual daughter nuclei after two iterations were assumed to be in their ground state .",
    "the smoker code has been applied extensively to many astrophysical problems , mainly where nuclei with mass number @xmath83 are involved . in such a case",
    "the requirement of a high level density , which is one of the main assumptions of the statistical model , is usually met , and the calculated cross sections are generally in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite . for",
    "the light nuclei considered here , an application of the statistical method might seem problematic because the level density in light nuclei can be small , and in many reactions with light nuclei , significant direct contributions have been found .",
    "however , by studying the de - excitations of @xmath0c and @xmath13o nuclei that had been excited by inelastic neutrino scattering , it was found that the branching ratios for decay into the proton and neutron channels , calculated within the statistical model , were in very good agreement with the branching ratios obtained from a continuum random phase approximation  @xcite .",
    "that means that at certain conditions , direct contributions can be effectively accounted for in the statistical model .",
    "although at specific excitation energies , the branchings calculated within both models deviated by a factor of 2 , the proton and neutron branchings averaged over various excitation spectra corresponding to different neutrino energies were found to match within 1 - 17% . as for our calculations in this paper , due to the spreading width of the excited state ,",
    "the branching ratios from the statistical model are also averaged over a range of excitation energies .",
    "therefore , we conservatively adopt the relative error in the branchings for one- and two - step decays to be 20% and 30% , respectively .",
    "we now turn to the results of our calculations of the final states of nuclear de - excitations following the disappearance of a neutron from the @xmath21 shell in @xmath0c .",
    "results of these calculations are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "they were obtained for an excited @xmath43 level at @xmath84  mev in @xmath36c with an associated lorentzian width of @xmath54=7  mev .    .",

    "for the final states marked with @xmath42 , due to the very large lifetime of the daughter nuclei , the experimental signature is assumed to be a single hit . [ cols=\"<,<,>,^ \" , ]     there are two final - state modes in this table that would result in a 3-hit event signature in the liquid scintillator detector , each with a branching of about 6@xmath86 per s - shell neutron .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the energy spectra of neutrons for these de - excitation modes .",
    "note that both spectra reflect an initial lorentz - shape distribution of excitation energy . for the mode @xmath87c@xmath88b@xmath89 , the proton , which comes from the decay of the first excited state in @xmath90c , is monoenergetic with energy 0.922 mev .",
    "the kamland detector @xcite is perfectly suited to search for the neutron disappearance processes in carbon , i.e. , for the observation of sequences of nuclear de - excitation events .",
    "the active mass of the kamland detector filled with a liquid scintillator ( formula @xmath24 ch@xmath91 ) is @xmath92 tons ; the trigger threshold can be as low as @xmath93 mev ; the photon energy resolution at 1 mev is @xmath94% .",
    "good time and energy resolution allow reconstruction of an event position in the detector with the accuracy down to several cm .",
    "low background in the kamland experiment is due to a deep underground location ( 2,700 meters of water equivalent ) , water shield , buffer oil shield , veto system , radon shields , and liquid scintillator purification that provide concentration of @xmath95u , @xmath96th , and @xmath97k at the level below @xmath98 g / g @xcite .",

    "the first hit will be followed by a second hit , which is due to neutron capture by hydrogen in the scintillator ( correlation time is @xmath101sec ) .",
    "the third hit will be due to delayed @xmath1 decay of @xmath87c@xmath89 with correlation time 27.8 sec and detectable energy in the range 1.743.65 mev .",

    "this accidental background rate can be measured in the detector and subtracted .",
    "using branching for @xmath36c@xmath99c@xmath89 from table [ tab1 ] and assuming no other sources of events with such a signature ( e.g. from atmospheric neutrino interactions ) , for one year of exposition time in the kamland detector , one can , with 90% cl , set a limit for 3nu decay at the level @xmath103 years .",
    "this is 1,000 times better than the present limit for this decay mode @xcite .",
    "detection of the 3-hit process @xmath36c@xmath104c@xmath89 will be similar to the one discussed above , probably with a different threshold for the first hit that will be formed by the slow - down interactions of neutrons in the liquid scintillator .",
    "detection of the 4-hit process @xmath36c@xmath105c@xmath89 would be a spectacular observation ; unfortunately its branching , as follows from table [ tab1 ] , is much lower than for two processes with the 3-hit signature discussed above .",
    "the two - hit events listed in table [ tab1 ] should be divided into two categories .",
    "events with one of the de - excitation particles being a neutron belong to the first category ; in kamland these events will have a signature similar to that for anti - neutrino reactor events with a corresponding background and will be difficult to disentangle",
    ". the second category should include events with radioactive daughter nuclei .",
    "events resulting from the neutron disappearance from the @xmath22 state of @xmath0c should also belong in this category .",
    "accidental coincidence background will be more of a problem for the events with long lifetime daughter isotopes therefore only modes with a production of @xmath36c@xmath89 might have practical interest for the detection .",
    "correlation time between two hits in this case is 20.4 min due to lifetime of @xmath36c@xmath89 .",
    "the statistical fluctuations of the background will determine the sensitivity limit for a corresponding process search . optimistically",
    ", this measurement alone can improve the existing lifetime limit for 3nu by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "de - excitation final states originated by the disappearance of two neutrons from @xmath0c provide two interesting 3-hit signatures : @xmath87c@xmath106c@xmath89with a branching of 6.2% and @xmath87c@xmath88b with a branching of 6.0% .",
    "the relatively short lifetime of the daughter nuclide makes such events free of accidental background .",
    "it is interesting to see whether atmospheric neutrino events can provide a signature similar to @xmath36c@xmath99c@xmath89 , @xmath36c@xmath104c@xmath89 , or other processes .",
    "we anticipate in the future to study this interesting question in a separate paper treating nuclear de - excitations produced by atmospheric neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in @xmath0c .",
    "such a study will also be interesting from the point of view of identification of atmospheric neutrino and anti - neutrino interactions in liquid scintillator detectors through the detection of associated nuclear chains of de - excitations and radio - nuclide decays . in the respect of the background for one - neutron or two - neutron disappearance addressed in this paper ,",
    "few qualitative comments can be made here .",
    "charged current atmospheric neutrino reactions have a rate of about 100 interactions per kt - detector per year . due to the relatively high energy spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos , leptons produced in charged current interactions usually have an energy larger than the energy typical for nucleus de - excitation .",
    "we remind the reader that in the kamiokande experiment @xcite the energy range between 19@xmath3750 mev was practically free of background .",
    "thus , one can hope that charge current processes initiated by atmospheric neutrinos will not produce significant background for neutron disappearance processes , i.e. , the chain of events with the first signal in a few - mev range . however , detailed simulations of atmospheric neutrino interactions with @xmath0c using the smoker code for treatment of nuclear de - excitations are needed to understand this background quantitatively . in such simulations ,",
    "the production of low energy charged leptons has to be estimated together with de - excitation of @xmath0n@xmath42 and @xmath0b@xmath42 nuclei with a continuous spectrum of excitations .",
    "neutral current atmospheric neutrino interactions should be also followed by de - excitations of @xmath0c@xmath42 ( see paper @xcite ) and might , for example , potentially lead to the process @xmath0c@xmath107c@xmath89 with one of the neutrons lost at the edge of the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "in this paper we show that modern high - mass , low - threshold , and low - background liquid scintillator detectors can observe unique signatures of chains of time- and space - correlated events , formed by nuclear de - excitations following the neutron or two - neutron disappearance from the nucleus .",
    "the kamland detector @xcite is perfectly suited to search for such processes originating from @xmath0c nuclei .",

    "<S> for neutrons bound inside nuclei , baryon instability can manifest itself as a decay into undetectable particles ( e.g. , 3nu ) , i.e. , as a disappearance of a neutron from its nuclear state . if electric charge is conserved , a similar disappearance is impossible for a proton . </S>",
    "<S> the existing experimental lifetime limit for neutron disappearance is 4 - 7 orders of magnitude lower than the lifetime limits with detectable nucleon decay products in the final state @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the spectrum of nuclear de - excitations that would result from the disappearance of a neutron or two neutrons from @xmath0c . </S>",
    "<S> we found that some de - excitation modes have signatures that are advantageous for detection in the modern high - mass , low - background , and low - threshold underground detectors , where neutron disappearance would result in a characteristic sequence of time- and space - correlated events . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the kamland detector @xcite , a time - correlated triple coincidence of a prompt signal , a captured neutron , and a @xmath1 decay of the residual nucleus , all originating from the same point in the detector , will be a unique signal of neutron disappearance allowing searches for baryon instability with sensitivity 3 - 4 orders of magnitude beyond the present experimental limits . </S>",
