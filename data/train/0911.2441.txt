    "in a recent work on the transcendence of the log - gamma function and some discrete periods , gun , murty and rath ( gmr ) have presented the following ` theorem ' on the transcendence of certain dirichlet series ( see theorem  4.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "[ gmr ] [ conj : gmr ] let @xmath4 be a non - integral rational number and @xmath5 be a natural number .",
    "then @xmath6 is a transcendental number .    in a recent work ,",
    "i have shown that even the main ` theorem ' in that work ( namely , their theorem  3.1 ) has an incorrect proof  @xcite .",
    "so , by suspecting that the above series could converge to an algebraic number for some non - integral rational @xmath4 , i have considered the possibility of finding a counterexample to their assertion . after some computational tests , i have found a simple counterexample : the series is _ null _ ( hence an algebraic number ) for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "of course , this implies that conjecture  [ conj : gmr ] , above , is _ false_.    here in this work , i show that the original proof by gun and co - workers is _ invalid _ when @xmath4 is a half - integer and @xmath2 is an odd integer . by repairing their defective proof ,",
    "i show that these values of @xmath4 and @xmath2 compose an ( infinite ) set containing all possible counterexamples , which allows for a correct reformulation of their assertion .",
    "this yields a theorem that determines whether @xmath9 is an algebraic or a transcendental number , for all rational @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and every @xmath11 , @xmath5 .",
    "my proof is based only upon the periodicity and some basic properties of this series .",
    "i also show that the theorem has interesting consequences for the transcendence of both the polygamma function at rational entries and certain zeta series .",
    "by testing the validity of the gmr conjecture for @xmath12 and some rational numbers @xmath13 , i have found the following counterexample .    [",
    "lem : k3a12 ] the series @xmath14 is _ null _ , thus an algebraic number .    by writing the above series as the sum of two series , one for the non - negative values of @xmath15 and the other for the negative ones , which is a valid procedure",
    "since the series converges absolutely , one has @xmath16 now , by substituting @xmath17 in the series for @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the series for @xmath20 , one has @xmath21",
    "@xmath22    the existence of a counterexample to the gmr conjecture implies that its original statement ( see theorem  4.1  ( 2 ) of ref .",

    "false_. in fact , by scrutinizing the proof furnished there in ref .",
    "@xcite , i have found some defective points .",
    "their proof reads  @xcite :    we know that @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "it is a consequence of a result of okada  @xcite that @xmath25 is non - zero .",

    "note , however , that this lemma says nothing about the cotangent derivatives at @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "then , the linear independence over @xmath38 is not guaranteed if @xmath43 is a half - integer , which is a source of potential counterexamples to the gmr conjecture . moreover , the proof of okada s theorem is based upon the following partial fraction decomposition for his function @xmath44 , valid for all @xmath40 ( see eq .",

    "property ( iii ) follows from the fact that the series for @xmath49 in eq .",
    "is term - by - term differentiable with respect to @xmath43 , without restrictions for @xmath57 , and that differentiation does not affect the convergence for any @xmath43 in this interval . as a sum / difference of two polygamma functions @xmath58 with @xmath57 , since each @xmath58 is differentiable at all points of this interval .",
    "this representation will be considered in the next section . ]",
    "this differentiability for @xmath57 can then be extended to all real @xmath40  i.e. , all points in the domain of @xmath49  by making use of their periodicity , as established in property ( i ) .",
    "property ( iv ) follows from a less direct argument .",
    "firstly , from eq .",
    "we deduce that , for any positive integer @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 by isolating the cotangent derivative at the right - hand side of eq .   and then substituting it on eq .",

    "then , @xmath65 is a strictly decreasing function in all points of its domain . @xmath66",
    "an immediate consequence of the periodicity of @xmath49 is the periodic repetition of the null result established for @xmath7 in lemma  [ lem : k3a12 ] .",

    "@xmath22    all counterexamples to the gmr original assertion presented hitherto are particular cases of a more general set of counterexamples , as establishes the next lemma .",

    "@xmath22    with these properties and counterexamples in hands , we can now reformulate the gmr conjecture .",
    "let us present and prove a theorem which determines whether @xmath80 is an algebraic number or not for non - integral rational values of @xmath4 .",

    ", it is easy to note that when the above cotangent derivative is non - zero , it is @xmath88 times a non - zero linear combination ( with integer coefficients ) of algebraic numbers of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath22    from the fact that @xmath100 is a transcendental number , as first proved by lindemann ( 1882 ) , it follows that    [ cor : transcend ] for any integer @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and every @xmath101 , the series @xmath82 is either null or a transcendental number . it is null * if and only if * @xmath102 is an odd integer and @xmath85 is a half - integer .",
    "another interesting consequence of theorem  [ teo : main ] comes from the fact that we can easily write the cotangent derivatives in eq .   in terms of the polygamma",
