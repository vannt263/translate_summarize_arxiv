    "@xcite these two properties have in common that they represent ensemble averages , rather than sample - to - sample fluctuations .",

    "this has immediate experimental consequences , because it is much easier to violate the condition @xmath113 than the condition @xmath112 .    to test this proposal ,",
    "an obvious next step would be to determine the ratio of time scales that govern the breakdown of universality of the fluctuations in the superconducting excitation gap .",
    "the numerical data in refs .   and was interpreted in terms of the ratio @xmath114 , but an alternative description in terms of the ratio @xmath115 was not considered .    one final remark about the distinction between classical and quantum fluctuations , explained in sec .",
    "it is possible to suppress the classical fluctuations entirely , by varying only the quasi - energy at fixed lead positions . in that case",
    "we would expect the breakdown of universality to be governed by @xmath110 instead of @xmath111 .",
    "our numerical data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) does not show any systematic deviation from rmt , probably because we could not reach sufficiently large systems in our simulation .",
    "_ note added _ : our final remark above has been criticized by jacquod and sukhorukov [ ] .",
    "they argue that the numerical data of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( and similar data of their own ) does not show any systematic deviation from rmt because quantum fluctuations remain universal if @xmath112 .",
    "their argument relies on the assumption that the effective rmt of ref .",
    "holds not only for the classical fluctuations ( as we assume here ) , but also for the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the effective rmt says that quantum fluctuations are due to a number @xmath116 of transmission channels with an rmt distribution .",
    "universality of the quantum fluctuations is then guaranteed even if @xmath117 , as long as @xmath118 is still large compared to unity .",
    "this line of reasoning , if pursued further , contradicts the established theory @xcite of the @xmath109 dependence of weak localization .",
    "rmt says that the weak localization correction @xmath119 is independent of the number of channels @xcite .",
    "validity of the effective rmt at the quantum level would therefore imply that weak localization remains universal if @xmath112 , as long as @xmath120 .",
