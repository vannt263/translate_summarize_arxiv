    "we wish to evaluate @xmath102 the integral over the brillouin zone is dominated by those values of @xmath103 where both green functions correspond to states near a saddle point .",
    "expanding the energy about the saddle points , we rewrite the integral as @xmath104 where the integral is understood to have a uv cutoff for @xmath103 of order @xmath105 .",
    "we now define @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and rewrite the above integral as @xmath108 we now define @xmath109 and rewrite the integral as @xmath110 we now assume @xmath111 ( which should certainly be the case for weak / moderate coupling ) . in this limit , we can perform the integral over @xmath112 approximately , using the cauchy integral formula , to get @xmath113 the imaginary part of the above integral is odd in @xmath114 and hence vanishes upon performing the matsubara sum to leave an integral that is purely real @xmath115 with logarithmic accuracy . performing the integral over @xmath116 ( again with logarithmic accuracy )",
    "gives @xmath117 where we take @xmath118 , @xmath119 and perform the discrete sum on mathematica .",
    "this time we want to evaluate @xmath120 again , we anticipate this integral will be dominated by regions of the brillouin zone where all three green functions correspond to states near saddle points .",
    "expanding the dispersion about the saddle points , we obtain @xmath121 making the same coordinate substitutions as in the preceding section , we recast this as @xmath122 after scaling out @xmath123 , we can rewrite it as @xmath124 where the rescaled integral is fully convergent , and can be done numerically on mathematica .",
    "the sum over matsubara frequencies can also be done on mathematica , and yields the answer @xmath125 comparing with the previous expression for @xmath43 , we see that @xmath126 .",
    "thus , @xmath127 provided the log is large .",
    "( if the log is not large then the evaluation of @xmath43 with logarithmic accuracy does not suffice , and sub - logarithmic contributions to @xmath43 must also be taken into account . )      we want to evaluate @xmath128 this time it is not possible to place all the green functions at the saddle points .",
    "in fact , we can not even place all the green functions at the fermi surface - the best that can be done is to place three of the green functions near a saddle point , but the fourth has to be off fermi surface .",
    "thus , we obtain , @xmath129 making the usual substitutions , and assuming @xmath130 , we obtain @xmath131 the integral is convergent . as usual , the imaginary part is odd in @xmath114 and vanishes and we care only about the real part . performing the integral on mathematica and taking the real part , we obtain @xmath132 which is parametrically smaller than @xmath43 and @xmath55 by @xmath52 .",
    "we now calculate the coefficient of the sixth order chirality sensitive term in the free energy , @xmath133 . after some analysis of diagrams we find that , @xmath134 we can now place all the green functions on the near a saddle point . making the usual substitutions , we obtain @xmath135 where in the second line we have assumed that the matsubara sum is controlled by the first few matsubara frequencies .",
    "the integral can be done numerically , and it is negative for small @xmath52 .",
    "it then follows that at weak / moderate coupling @xmath136 , so that the free energy at sixth order also disfavors chirality .",
    "the above calculations were performed at weak / moderate coupling , assuming @xmath97 .",
    "however , the integrals can be evaluated at arbitrary @xmath52 . to this end",

    "at strong coupling , when @xmath138 and @xmath100 , our analysis based on ginzburg - landau expansion is less accurate because fermions can no longer be approximated as free particles ( the self - energy corrections to fermionic lines and vertex corrections to square and hexagonal diagrams are generally of order one ) . nevertheless , if we apply our analysis to @xmath100 , we find that @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath139 all change signs at some @xmath52 ( see fig .  [ fig : scaling functions ] ) .",
    "the first sign change occurs in the sixth order chirality sensitive term @xmath46 , which becomes positive for @xmath140 .",
    "when @xmath46 is positive , the chiral sdw state @xcite is energetically favored , provided we are sufficiently far below @xmath0 for the sixth order term to dominate over the quartic term @xmath44 .",
    "thus , at large @xmath52 , the uniaxial sdw phase has a much narrower region of stability , and the transition into the chiral sdw phase happens quite close to @xmath0 .",
    "the term @xmath141 is next to change sign , becoming negative for @xmath142 .",
    "once this term becomes negative , the system prefers instead a @xmath143 collinear state , of the form discussed in @xcite , wherein sdw order develops only at a single nesting vector .",
    "the subsequent sign change of @xmath44 at @xmath144 has no physical consequences .",
    "the @xmath143 collinear sdw state that forms at @xmath145 is a ( full ) metal because the entire fs is not gapped out .",
    "the competition between a metallic collinear state and non - coplanar insulating state has been detected numerically in the mean - field analysis at strong coupling @xcite , and our results for the strong coupling case are in line with this earlier study .",
    "our strong coupling results are also consistent with the studies that found a non - coplanar , chiral sdw order in the models of spins of the same fixed length at every lattice site @xcite . however , in the weak / moderate coupling limit , our results indicate that the preferred state is a uniaxial @xmath59 state of a sort not considered before , which can only be realized in a model starting from itinerant fermions .",
    "we also analyzed the evolution of @xmath99 with @xmath52 for fermions on a triangular lattice .",
    "we found similar trends , e.g. , sign change of @xmath46 .",
    "however , for a triangular lattice , the first sign change ( in @xmath46 ) occurs at a much larger @xmath146 , when the itinerant approach is very questionable ."

    "<S> our result differs from earlier mean - field analysis  @xcite which found non - coplanar insulating sdw order at weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , the @xmath59 state that we found , with non - equal spin length on different sites , was not considered in that work and other earlier considerations of the type of sdw order . </S>",
    "<S> we found analogous results for fermions on a triangular lattice at van hove filling . </S>",
    "<S> this system is identical to graphene , except that the nesting is less robust and is spoiled already by second neighbor hopping .    </S>",
    "<S> _ properties of a uniaxial sdw : _ is the uniaxial sdw state a metal or an insulator ? to address this issue we need to compute the fermionic spectrum . without loss of generality , we take the sdw to be uniaxial along the @xmath64 axis , so that @xmath65 is a good quantum number , and spin - up and spin - down fermions decouple . </S>",
    "<S> consider the state with @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the up spins near the three van hove points are described by a simple @xmath67 hamiltonian @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the dispersions near the van hove points , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ n_1 ] ) , and @xmath70 is the sdw - induced shift of the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath67 hamiltonian describing the spin down branch is obtained by taking @xmath71 . at @xmath72 ( i.e. , at van hove points ) </S>",
    "<S> the energies of spin - up excitations @xmath73 are @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , and the energies of spin - down excitations are @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . in conventional sdw states </S>",
    "<S> ( e.g. , sdw on a 2d square lattice ) @xmath78 is negligibly small and can be safely neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that in our case @xmath79 , so that gapless excitations arise in the spin - down spectrum .    to see the unexpected shift of the chemical potential , we diagonalize eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m_1 ] ) and the corresponding equation for down spins and inspect six branches of excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that fixing @xmath79 ensures that both in the paramagnetic and in the @xmath59 uniaxial sdw state there are four bands with @xmath80 and two bands with @xmath81 for all momenta in the reduced bz ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the chemical potential is fixed by the constraint that the total number of electrons ( equal to the number of states below the chemical potential ) must not change between @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite , it follows that we must set @xmath84 . for verification </S>",
    "<S> , we computed the thermodynamic potential @xmath85 from ( [ eq : grand potential ] ) , numerically solved the simultaneous equations @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and confirmed that @xmath79 to a high accuracy .    having determined that @xmath79 , we find from ( [ m_1 ] ) that gapless excitations emerge when @xmath88 , which has solutions along three lines passing through each van hove point . </S>",
    "<S> two of then coincide with the original fs , the third is directed towards the center of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59 uniaxial sdw state is then obviously a metal . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize , however , that gapless states exist only for the electrons with spin projection opposite to @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons with spin projection along @xmath89 are fully gapped . </S>",
    "<S> since a fermi surface exists for one spin projection only , we dub this state a ` half metal . ' </S>",
    "<S> we found an analogous ` half - metal ' spectrum for the @xmath59 uniaxial sdw phase on the triangular lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the half - metallic nature of the sdw should manifest itself in numerous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in tunneling experiments conducted with electrons spin polarized along the @xmath64 axis , a hard gap will be seen for down spins , but a fermi surface will be seen for up spins . furthermore , since the low energy charged excitations involve up spins only , any charge currents will necessarily also be spin currents . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the half metal state allows for electrical control of spin currents , which may be beneficial for nanoscience applications .    </S>",
    "<S> _ order parameter manifold : _   the uniaxial sdw order obviously breaks @xmath90 spin - rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it also breaks @xmath46 discrete symmetry associated with either parallel or antiparallel ordering of @xmath60 , i.e. , in addition to the @xmath91 state which we considered above , there are also @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 states . </S>",
    "<S> these states have an identical structure of fermionic excitations , and correspond to the four in - equivalent ways to choose which two of the eight sites of the sdw unit cell carry large spins ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , the three other states from the @xmath46 manifold are obtained from the @xmath91 state by shifting the origin of coordinates to the center of one of three neighboring hexagons . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting possibility , which deserves further study , is that @xmath46 symmetry can be broken before @xmath90 symmetry , leading to a nematic - like state  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram : _   thus far we have constructed the ginzburg - landau expansion in small @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion becomes less justified as we move towards zero temperature . to investigate the behavior at arbitrary @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> we calculate numerically the full free energies of the various sdw states from ( [ eq : grand potential ] ) . upon doing this , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath59 uniaxial state has the lowest free energy over a wide range of intermediate temperatures , but undergoes a first order transition at a lower temperature to the insulating chiral sdw state discussed in earlier works  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show the free energy profile in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum]b . </S>",
    "<S> we found this behavior both for graphene and for fermions on a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , the chiral sdw state wins at the lowest @xmath96 because it has spin - degenerate excitations and opens a full spectral gap , unlike the half - metal state .    the free energy profile in fig . [ fig : spectrum]b is for weak / moderate coupling , when @xmath97 . at @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is more complex and less universal . for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the forms of @xmath99 and the phase diagram at @xmath100 in the supplementary material @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion : _   we considered in this work the sdw instability on the honeycomb and triangular lattices , when doped to the saddle points of the dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the sdw instability is subleading to a @xmath101wave superconducting instability at weak coupling , but becomes the leading instability if superconductivity is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that if the sdw ordering temperature @xmath0 is much smaller than the fermionic bandwidth , then a uniaxial sdw order develops simultaneously at three inequivalent nesting vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this has an order parameter manifold @xmath2 and corresponds to the ordering pattern shown in fig.[fig : lattice ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a state can only be obtained from an model of itinerant electrons with interactions , and not from a spin model of local moments . </S>",
    "<S> we found that such sdw state is a half - metal in which gapless excitations exist in one spin branch only . </S>",
    "<S> such a state may be beneficial for nanoscience applications particularly because charge currents will necessarily also be spin currents , which allows for electrical control of the latter .    </S>",
