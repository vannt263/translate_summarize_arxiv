    "pair - density - wave ( pdw ) superconducting order has emerged as a realistic candidate for order in the charge - ordered region of the pseudogap phase of the cuprates near one - eighth filling .",
    "it naturally accounts for both superconducting ( sc ) correlations and for static quasi - long - range charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order observed near this hole doping and at temperatures below approximately 150 k @xcite , and it can explain observed signatures of broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , pdw can lead to the quantum oscillations seen in the cuprates @xcite and can also explain anomalous quasi - particle properties observed by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations of theories of a doped mott insulator reveal pdw order to be a competitive ground - state to @xmath0-wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to find experiments that can identify pdw order in the cuprates .",
    "motivated by the observation of checkerboard cdw order inside @xmath0-wave vortex cores by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite and by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , we examine the competition between @xmath0-wave and pdw superconductivity in applied magnetic fields .",
    "previous theoretical studies of competing orders in a magnetic field have emphasized competing spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order @xcite , cdw order @xcite , and staggered flux phases @xcite with @xmath0-wave superconductivity . competing pdw and @xmath0-wave order has not been extensively studied ( note that superconducting phase disordered pdw competing with @xmath0-wave order has been examined @xcite ) .",
    "here , we find that inside the vortex cores of @xmath0-wave superconductivity , pdw order drives the observed checkerboard cdw order and , in conjunction with @xmath0-wave superconductivity , it also drives an additional cdw order that appears in a ring - like region outside the vortex cores .",
    "this additional cdw order has twice the period of the observed checkerboard cdw order and serves as a smoking gun for pdw order .    to    in the following ,",
    "we develop a phenomenological theory for competing pdw and @xmath0-wave superconductivity , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : htdiagram ] .",
    "we assume that in zero field , only @xmath0-wave superconductivity appears at the expense of the pdw order .",
    "the pdw order can only appear when the @xmath0-wave order is weakened by the external field .",
    "this is followed by an analysis of the core structure of a single @xmath0-wave vortex , where we show that pdw order appears inside these cores , without any phase winding , generating the cdw order discussed above .",
    "finally , we examine the behavior of this competing system as the field is further increased and identify a transition at which pdw order develops phase coherence and forms a vortex phase . at the mean - field level , pdw order simultaneously breaks gauge invariance and translational symmetry .",
    "fluctuations can lead to two separate transitions : one for which gauge symmetry is broken and one for which translational symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "we argue that at high fields , the superconducting order is removed by phase fluctuations , leaving behind the cdw order seen through nmr experiments .",
    "to investigate the physics resulting from the @xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : htdiagram ] , we consider a model with competing @xmath0-wave and pdw superconductivity .",
    "the pdw order parameter is represented by a four component complex vector @xmath3 , defined as @xmath4 and the @xmath0-wave by one complex ( scalar ) field @xmath5 . for an external applied field @xmath6 , which we will take to be along the @xmath7-axis , @xmath8 ,",
    "the ginzburg - landau free - energy density is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic field and @xmath11 its vector potential .",
    "@xmath12 describes the pair - density - wave @xmath3 , and @xmath13 its coupling to the @xmath0-wave order that obeys @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "symmetry arguments dictate that the free energy of the pdw has the following structure @xcite : @xmath16 here , we neglect variations along the @xmath7-axis , thus @xmath17 is the spatial index , while @xmath18 is a wave - vector index : @xmath19 . in the following , another convenient index @xmath20 , will also be used .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 of the kinetic term satisfy the following relation @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 measures the anisotropy of the system .",
    "has very little influence on the physics we describe here .",
    "we verified that indeed for @xmath25 , moderate anisotropies do not qualitatively change the physical properties we discuss .",
    "thus in the rest of the paper , we consider only the isotropic case @xmath26 . ] here @xmath27 represents the wavevector @xmath28 , @xmath29 represents @xmath30 , and @xmath31 represents the gap associated with the pairing between the fermion states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the momentum and @xmath35 , @xmath36 denote the spin - states .",
    "our choice of the wavevectors and model for the pdw order is motivated by the recent proposal of amperean pairing by p.a .",
    "lee @xcite , for which it has been shown that pdw order can account for both the anomalous quasi - particle properties observed by arpes and the cdw order ( at momenta 2@xmath37 and 2@xmath38 ) observed in the pseudogap phase of bi@xmath39sr@xmath40la@xmath41cuo@xmath42 ( bi2201 ) . depending on the parameters @xmath43 , the free energy of the pdw sector allows five possible distinct ground - states @xcite .",
    "we choose parameters such that , in the non - competing case , the pdw ground - state has the form @xmath44 .",
    "this pdw ground - state is the same as that proposed in ref .   and is also found to be a ground - state in the spin - fermion model @xcite .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath3 interact with the magnetic field ( through the kinetic terms ) and are therefore indirectly coupled .",
    "they also directly interact through @xmath13 : @xmath45{\\delta_d}^2 + c.c.\\right)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in is a bi - quadratic coupling between the @xmath0-wave and the pair - density - wave @xmath46 .",
    "the coexistence of both order parameters is penalized for positive values @xmath47 , and when strong enough , only one of the condensates supports a nonzero ground - state density .",
    "our choice of parameters is such that when @xmath48 , @xmath5 has lower condensation energy and @xmath3 is completely suppressed , because of the interaction terms .",
    "moreover , as cdw order emerges at high field , we require @xmath3 to have a higher second critical field ( @xmath49 ) than @xmath5 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "these conditions lead to fig .",
    "[ fig : htdiagram ] .",
    "we note that in principle , the existence of the competing pdw order can allow for the pdw driven cdw order to appear in zero field in the vicinity of inhomogeneities or due to fluctuations in some materials . indeed cdw order has been observed in yba@xmath39cu@xmath51o@xmath52 in zero field through high - energy x - ray diffraction @xcite ( this cdw order is enhanced by magnetic fields ) .",
    "we take cdw order to be denoted by @xmath53 ( note that @xmath54 ) . the coupling between @xmath55 ( with @xmath20 ) and",
    "pdw order is given by @xcite : @xmath56 assuming that the cdw order is induced by the pdw order , we find that @xmath57 the cdw order given by @xmath55 corresponds to that observed in the pseudogap phase in zero field and to the checkerboard order observed inside the @xmath0-wave vortex cores . an important feature of this work is that the interplay between @xmath0-wave and pdw orders gives rise to an additional contribution to the cdw order .",
    "in particular , this coupling is given by @xcite @xmath58 \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\rho_{-q}[\\delta_{q}\\delta_d^*+\\delta_{-q}^*\\delta_d ] \\big )    \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] differentiation with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath60 yields the relations ( this also assumes the cdw order is purely induced ) : @xmath61    the contributions @xmath62 and @xmath63 to the cdw are reconstructed according to @xmath64 which shows the @xmath65th - order contribution to the cdw .",
    "the cdw order @xmath62 has twice the periodicity of @xmath63 and is not an induced order of the pure @xmath3 : it only appears when both @xmath5 and @xmath3 coexist .",
    "consequently , @xmath62 is a signature of the appearance of @xmath3 in a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "note that the existence of @xmath62 requires superconducting phase coherence for both the pdw and @xmath0-wave orders ( strictly speaking , coherence in the phase difference between these two orders will suffice ) .",
    "we note that an observation of @xmath62 has been reported @xcite , and below we make predictions about the structure of @xmath62 around a vortex in @xmath5 .",
    "in order to investigate the interplay of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , within the framework sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : htdiagram ] , we numerically minimize the free energy both for single vortices and for a finite sample in external field .",
    "the theory is discretized within a finite element formulation @xcite and minimized using a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm ( for detailed discussion on the numerical methods , see , for example , @xcite ) .    to    typical single vortex solutions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vortex ] ) clearly show that the components of the pdw order acquire small , yet nonzero density at the center of the @xmath0-wave vortex core . as a result ,",
    "the cdw order is also nonzero at the vortex core .",
    "far from the vortex , the @xmath3 decays to zero , and the induced cdw is suppressed as well .",
    "[ fig : checkerboard ] shows the magnitude of the total cdw order as well as the contributions from different orders in @xmath66 . here , we used the values @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the cu - cu distance in cuprates and , in qualitative accordance with experimental data @xcite",
    ", we take the @xmath0-wave coherence length to be @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath63 forms a checkerboard pattern that extends significantly outside the vortex core , and this is consistent with the observations .    to    in addition to this checkerboard order , we also find that @xmath62 , which varies at twice the wave - length of @xmath63 , is nonzero and also has a non - trivial structure .",
    "more precisely , at the singularity in the @xmath0-wave , @xmath71 , and when @xmath72 becomes nonzero , @xmath62 also becomes nonzero .",
    "since @xmath3 exhibits no phase winding , @xmath73 inherits the phase winding of @xmath5 .",
    "a phase winding in @xmath62 implies a dislocation in the corresponding real - space order @xcite .",
    "consequently , the cdw order associated with @xmath62 has a dislocation at the vortex core .",
    "since @xmath62 is suppressed in vortex cores , the checkerboard pattern that appears there , is essentially due to @xmath63 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath62 to the cdw becomes important at distances larger than @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , as it varies with a doubled wave - length , every other charge peak is magnified in a region outside the core .",
    "note that away from the vortex , @xmath62 is suppressed at a much slower rate than @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath62 is observable at all , then it should vanish at @xmath50 , while @xmath63 , will persist to much higher fields .",
    "to investigate the evolution of the pdw and @xmath0-wave orders in external field @xmath6 , for parameters corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : htdiagram ] , we minimize the free energy , while imposing @xmath75 at the ( insulating ) boundary of the domain .",
    "we follow the vertical line sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : htdiagram ] .",
    "that is , starting from @xmath48 , the field is sequentially increased after the solution for the current value of @xmath1 is found .",
    "typical results illustrating such a simulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] .    to    in low fields , only @xmath5 has a nonzero ground - state density and , as a result of the competition with @xmath5 in the interacting terms , @xmath3 is fully suppressed ( or vanishingly small ) .    above the first critical field , vortices in @xmath5 , carrying a small amount @xmath3 in their core , start entering the system .",
    "the averaged pdw over the whole sample @xmath76 is still vanishingly small . with increasing field , the density of vortices increases and they start to overlap .",
    "that is , @xmath77 and @xmath78 do not have  enough room \" to recover their ground - state values . at this point ,",
    "the lumps of @xmath3 , previously isolated in vortex cores , interconnect and @xmath3 acquires a phase coherence globally .",
    "this behavior was also found to occur in a similar system with competing orders @xcite . at this phase transition ,",
    "not only does @xmath76 become nonzero , but the induced cdw @xmath79 and @xmath80 , also become nonzero on average ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that this phase transition is related to that seen though nmr @xcite .",
    "when the pdw order is on average nonzero , energetic considerations dictate that it should acquire phase winding as well .",
    "indeed , when two condensates have nonzero density , the energy of configurations that has winding in only one condensate diverges ( at least logarithmically ) with the system size . as a result vortices in @xmath81",
    "are created when @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "note that as it is still beneficial to have nonzero @xmath3 inside the vortex cores of @xmath5 , the singularities that are formed due to the winding in @xmath81 do not overlap with those of @xmath5 [ and they do not overlap with each other due to the terms @xmath43 in , which favor core splitting ] .",
    "thus , the cdw order still appears within the vortex cores of @xmath5 .",
    "since all the vortices that are created do not overlap with each other , the magnetic induction is smeared out and is much more spatially uniform than in usual vortex phases .    for fields above the second critical field of @xmath5 , only the pdw order survives . as a result , the contribution @xmath73 to the induced cdw also vanishes and the observed cdw order above @xmath50 is solely that induced by the pdw ( that is @xmath63 ) . in this state , at the mean - field level , the vortices in @xmath81 do not overlap , as the terms with @xmath43 in favor vortex core splitting . in principle , the parameters @xmath43 can also be chosen so that the @xmath81 cores coincide for some or all pdw components .",
    "this will not change the qualitative physics associated with the competition between @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , it will affect the resulting high - field regime .",
    "in either case , we expect superconducting phase fluctuations to play an important role in the high - field phase .",
    "in particular , it is known that for type - ii superconductors , high magnetic fields significantly enhance the role of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "phase fluctuations will remove the superconducting long - range order of the pdw state , but the cdw order can still survive @xcite .",
    "a related mechanism was also considered in a different but related model of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "we have considered a model of competing pair - density - wave and @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "the superconducting state in the meissner phase is purely @xmath0-wave . with increasing external field ,",
    "vortices in the @xmath0-wave superconductor are formed and they carry pdw and induced cdw order in their core .",
    "when these vortices significantly interact , the lumps of pdw order acquire global phase coherence and both pdw and @xmath0-wave superconductivity coexist . in the regions where both pdw and @xmath0-wave order exist ,",
    "the induced cdw order features a @xmath73 contribution that exists at twice the periodicity of the cdw order observed in the pseudogap phase at zero fields .",
    "the observation of @xmath73 can serve to identify the existence of pdw order in the pseudogap phase .",
