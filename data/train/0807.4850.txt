    "the first - order theories of peano arithmetic and zermelo - fraenkel set theory with the axiom of infinity negated are bi - interpretable : that is , they are mutually interpretable with interpretations that are inverse to each other .    more precisely , they showed that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are bi - interpretable , where @xmath3 is obtained from @xmath4 by negating the axiom of infinity , and @xmath2 is obtained from @xmath3 by adding an axiom of transitive containment , which says that each set is contained in a transitive set .    in this note ,",
    "i describe a theory of sets that is bi - interpretable with the bounded arithmetic @xmath0 . because of the weakness of this theory of sets , i can not straightforwardly adapt kaye and wong s interpretation of the arithmetic in the set theory .",
    "instead , i am forced to produce a different interpretation .    in section [ interps ] , i lay down some notation and definitions that will aid the discussion of interpretations throughout the paper . in section [ ea ] , i describe a theory of sets called @xmath5 and , in section [ eaid ] , i describe the ackermann interpretation of this theory in @xmath0 . in section [ ordcardinterps ] , i consider a natural interpretation of @xmath0 in @xmath5 , but note that it is not inverse to the ackermann interpretation , and , in section [ idea ] , i describe my alternative to kaye and wong s inverse .",
    "kaye and wong consider only first - order languages with relation symbols .",
    "however , both @xmath0 and the set theory described in section [ ea ] are most naturally formulated in languages that include function symbols .",
    "after all , amongst the axioms of both theories are schema that are indexed by the set of _ bounded quantifier formulae _ of the language  the axiom schema of induction for @xmath0 and the axiom schema of subset separation for @xmath5 . and it is most natural to stipulate which formulae are to count as bounded by appealing to terms of the language built up using function symbols .",
    "thus , we consider first - order languages with relation symbols _ and _ function symbols .",
    "however , this is not essential .",
    "we could formulate both theories in languages that contain only relation symbols . and",
    ", if we were to do this , our interpretability results would still go through using kaye and wong s definition of bi - interpretability for languages that only contain relation symbols .    like kaye and wong",

    "@xmath58    @xmath59    a remark is in order . like kaye and wong ,",
    "i wish to interpret set theory in arithmetic using the interpretation described by ackermann in @xcite .",
    "if we are to find an inverse to this interpretation , we must ensure , for every sentence @xmath60 of our chosen set theory , that our chosen arithmetic proves the ackermann translation of @xmath60 only if our set theory proves @xmath60 . here",
    "are two important examples . @xmath1 and @xmath0 both prove the and both prove the weak hierarchy principle . however",
    ", neither sentence occurs as an axiom in kaye and wong s @xmath2 .",
    "this is not a problem because , in @xmath3 , the is equivalent to kaye and wong s @xmath61 , which says that each set is contained in a transitive set ; and , in without , the is equivalent to the negation of .",
    "however , neither of these equivalences hold in the relevant fragments of ea : follows from and @xmath62 follows from the , but neither converse holds .",
    "thus , we must include the full strength of the and the in our axioms .",
    "as mentioned above , i will exploit ackermann s interpretation of arithmetic in set theory to interpret @xmath5 in @xmath0 .",
    "i describe this interpretation in this section ; in section [ idea ] , i describe its inverse .",
    "the ackermann interpretation of set theory in arithmetic is based on the following interpretation of the membership relation : @xmath63\\ ] ] the right - hand side says that the @xmath64 bit of @xmath65 is 1 .",
    "further , @xmath66 to complete our definition of @xmath67 , we must define @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and , for each bounded quantifier formula @xmath43 , @xmath72 .",
    "these are straightforward to define , if somewhat intricate . with this in hand , it is equally straightforward to establish that    @xmath73 defines an interpretation of @xmath5 in @xmath0 .",
    "_ the proofs of extensionality@xmath74 and foundation@xmath74 are adapted from the well - known proofs of these sentences in @xmath1 . in that case , they are proved by induction . in @xmath0 , we identify bounds for the quantifiers in the induction formulae and proceed as before .",
    "dedekind finiteness@xmath74 is derived as a consequence of the ackermann interpretation of what mayberry calls _",
    "one point extension induction _ , which is easily seen to be provable by bounded induction in @xmath0 ( theorem 8.3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "one point extension induction says that , for any bounded quantifier formula @xmath43 , we have @xmath75\\rightarrow \\forall x\\phi(x)\\ ] ]    the proof concludes by establishing that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 have the properties that the translations of the corresponding axioms require of them .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "kaye and wong note that there is an obvious interpretation of @xmath1 in @xmath2 , which interprets the arithmetic as ordinal arithmetic .",
    "thus , let @xmath77 be the class of von neumann ordinals , as usual , and define the following relations on this class : @xmath78 ( ordinal addition ) and @xmath79 ( ordinal multiplication ) .",
    "then let @xmath80 be the interpretation mapping defined as follows : @xmath81    @xmath82 defines an interpretation of @xmath1 in @xmath2 .    as kaye and wong point out , @xmath82 is clearly not inverse to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we must look elsewhere . in the next section",
    ", we do this .    nonetheless , before we seek the inverse interpretation , we note in passing that we can not adapt @xmath82 to give an interpretation of @xmath0 in @xmath5 .",
    "this is a consequence of the following fact : in @xmath5 , we can not prove that the class of von neumann ordinals is closed under ordinal addition , let alone multiplication and exponentiation .",
    "this , in turn , is a consequence of the following theorem .",
    "[ gblfnboundinglemma ] suppose @xmath43 is a bounded quantifier formula of @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath83 if , and only if , there is a natural number @xmath84 such that @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "_ proof sketch .",
    "_ this is proved in two steps .",
    "first , for bounded quantifier @xmath43 , we show that @xmath87 if , and only if , there is a term @xmath47 of @xmath5 such that @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , this is analogous to parikh s celebrated result concerning @xmath0 ( theorem 4.4 of @xcite ) , and may be proved using a similar compactness argument .",
    "this is possible in part because separation is restricted to bounded quantifier formulae ; a single unbounded quantifier instance would render the theorem false .",
    "second , we show , by induction on the construction of terms in @xmath5 , that , for any term @xmath47 of @xmath5 , there is @xmath84 such that @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath76    as we will see in section [ idea ] , this result also entails that kaye and wong s inverse to the ackermann interpretation can not be defined from @xmath0 to @xmath5 .",
    "however , although we can not define an _ ordinal _ interpretation of @xmath0 in @xmath5 , we can define a _",
    "cardinal _ interpretation : see @xcite . to state this , we need some notation :    * @xmath90 iff there is an injection from @xmath91 into @xmath65 * @xmath92 iff @xmath90 and @xmath93 * @xmath94 iff @xmath90 but @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 be the interpretation mapping defined as follows : @xmath97    @xmath98 defines an interpretation of @xmath0 in @xmath5 .    under this interpretation ,",
    "the bounded induction axioms of @xmath0 follow from @xmath99-induction for bounded quantifier formulae in @xmath5 : see theorem 8.3.3 of @xcite .",
    "again , however , it is clear that @xmath98 and @xmath73 are not inverses of each other .",
    "to define the inverse to the ackermann interpretation of @xmath2 in @xmath1 , kaye and wong exploit a function @xmath100 , which takes each set to its ` ackermann code ' in the von neumann ordinals .",
    "that is , @xmath101 satisfies the following @xmath99-recursive definition , @xmath102 where the bounded sum and exponentiation operation on the right - hand side are ordinal bounded sum and ordinal exponentiation respectively . with this in hand",
    ", they define @xmath103 as follows : @xmath104 where the relations in the final three lines on the right - hand side are relations on the ordinals .    in section [ ordcardinterps",
    "] , i noted that the von neumann ordinals are not closed under addition in @xmath5 and i remarked that this precludes the usual ordinal interpretation of @xmath0 in @xmath5 . here",
    "again it prevents an interpretation .",
    "clearly , we can not define kaye and wong s function @xmath101 , nor _ a fortiori _ their interpretation @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we must be more resourceful .",
    "essentially , kaye and wong s inverse interpretation @xmath105 exploits two facts : ( i ) the von neumann ordinals provide a model of @xmath1 ; and ( ii ) there is a bijection between the universe and that model that takes a set to its ` ackermann code ' in the model",
    ". we can not adapt their construction because , as we have seen , in @xmath5 , the von neumann ordinals do not provide a model of @xmath0",
    ".    however , we can adapt their strategy .",
    "i will define a class of sets in @xmath5 with the following two properties : ( i ) it provides a model of @xmath0 ; and ( ii ) there is a bijection between the universe and that model that takes a set to its ` ackermann code ' in the model .    indeed , the class is @xmath106 , the class of all sets . and",
    "the bijection is simply the identity mapping .",
    "that is , i will define a set @xmath107 , a relation @xmath108 , and functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 such that @xmath113 .",
    "then i will show that each set is its own ackermann code , when considered as an element in this model .",
    "this will give rise to the following natural interpretation @xmath114 , which is inverse to @xmath73 : @xmath115    the definitions of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 depend on a function that takes each level of the cumulative hierarchy @xmath116 to a linear ordering of @xmath116 . to define this function",
    ", we need to introduce the notion of a _",
    "lexicographical ordering_. first , notation : given a linear ordering @xmath117 $ ] , let @xmath118 .",
    "given a linear ordering @xmath119 , define the lexicographical ordering , @xmath120 , of the power set of @xmath121 as follows : given @xmath122 , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the symmetric difference of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "now suppose @xmath116 is a level of the cumulative hierarchy .",
    "that is , there is a linear ordering @xmath52 $ ] such that @xmath127 , @xmath54 , and @xmath57 for @xmath128 , ... , @xmath129 .",
    "then we define a local function @xmath130 we define @xmath131 by recursion along @xmath52 $ ] as follows : @xmath132 \\mbox{\\ \\ ( the empty ordering ) } \\\\ \\ack(v_{k+1 } ) & = & \\mathrm{lex}(\\ack(v_k))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath5 , we can prove that this recursion is effective  that is , we can prove that there is such a local function @xmath131 .",
    "the reason is that a set containing all the values taken by @xmath131 can be specified prior to carrying out the recursion : the set is the set of those linear orderings whose fields are subsets of @xmath116 .",
    "thus , it is an instance of _",
    "definition by limited recursion _ in mayberry s terminology : see theorem 9.2.2 of @xcite . in @xmath5 , recursions may be carried out if it is possible to specify a set containing the range of the recursively defined function _ prior to defining the function_. recursions in which this is not possible are not necessarily effective in @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath133 .",
    "thus , together with the weak hierarchy principle , this construction induces an order on the universe of sets : @xmath134 ( recall that @xmath135 is the first level of the cumulative hierarchy at which @xmath91 occurs . )",
    "i claim that the universe of sets , ordered in this way , provides a model of @xmath0 .",
    "i describe this model precisely now .",
    "let @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath137 be the element of the ordering @xmath138 that follows immediately after @xmath91 .",
    "( since all sets and thus all linear orderings are finite , every linear ordering has endpoints and immediate successors and predecessors . )",
    "to define addition , multiplication , and exponentiation , we require a little notation : given a linear ordering @xmath119 and @xmath139 , let @xmath140_l$ ] denote the segment of @xmath119 between @xmath91 and @xmath65 inclusive .",
    "now , without loss of generality , suppose @xmath141 .",
    "so @xmath142 .",
    "then , since @xmath143 is an ordering of @xmath144 , which is a level of the cumulative hierarchy , it follows that @xmath145 .",

    "@xmath149_{\\ack(\\p(\\r(y)))}\\right ) $ ]    in the proof of theorem [ numerals ] , it will become clear why we must begin with @xmath150 rather than with @xmath37 : in short , it avoids a ` bug by one ' problem .",
    "define @xmath151 and @xmath152 similarly .",
    "this completes our definition of the interpretation mapping @xmath114 .",
    "the following easy theorem establishes that @xmath153 defines an interpretation of @xmath0 in @xmath5 .    @xmath113 .",
    "we now turn to the problem of showing that @xmath73 and @xmath153 are inverses .",
    "it suffices to prove the following theorem :    [ numerals ] @xmath154    _ proof .",
    "_ we prove this indirectly .",
