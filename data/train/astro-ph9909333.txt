    "the amount of interstellar dust is indirectly inferred in the following way : the abundances of elements heavier than helium measured along the line - of - sight to a nearby star are compared with `` cosmic abundances '' and any missing heavy elements are assumed to be tied up in grains , which gives the amount of interstellar dust ( cf . _",

    "galactic dust is believed to originate from a variety of different stars and stellar phenomena : e.g. carbon - rich stars , red giants , or supernovae , all of which provide dust with a different and characteristic chemical and isotopic signature ( for a review , see _ dorschner and henning _ , 1995 ) .",
    "a variety of presolar grains have been identified in primitive meteorites : e.g. diamonds , graphite , silicon carbide , or corundum grains ( _ zinner _ , 1998 ) .",

    "the composition of the bulk of the grains is largely unknown .",

    "interstellar dust was identified as close as 1.8 au from the sun at ecliptic latitudes above @xmath12 ( _ grn et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , dust impact measurements from the hiten satellite , in high eccentric orbit about the earth , gave indications that interstellar meteoroids indeed reached the earth s orbit ( _ svedhem et al .",

    "other dust measurements by galileo confirmed these findings ( _ baguhl et al . _ , 1995 ; _ baguhl et al .",

    "modeling of the galileo and ulysses data suggested that up to @xmath13 of dust flux , with masses above @xmath3 , at 1 au is of interstellar origin ( _ grn et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; _ landgraf _ , 1999 ) .",
    "the masses of clearly identified interstellar grains range from @xmath8 to above @xmath14 with a maximum at about @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , even bigger ( @xmath15 ) interstellar meteors have been reliably identified ( _ taylor et al .",
    "_ , 1996 , _ baggaley _",
    "the deficiency of small grain masses ( @xmath16 ) is not solely introduced by the detection threshold of the galileo and ulysses instruments , but indicates a depletion of small interstellar grains in the heliosphere .",

    "_ , 1999 ; _ linde and gombosi _ , 1999 ; _ landgraf _ , 1999 ) , show that these particles are strongly impeded from entering the inner planetary system by the interaction with the ambient magnetic field that is carried by the solar wind .",
    "we will assume in the following analysis that , in addition to the big particles observed within the heliosphere , there exist also the astronomically observed smaller grains in the local interstellar medium .",
    "astronomically observed interstellar dust is conveniently described by the mrn size distribution ( _ mathis , et al . _ , 1977 ) ranging from 5 to 250 nm in size ( about @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) .",
    "the size distribution of these particles can be described by a power law distribution ( with an exponent of -3.5 ) and the total amount is related to the volatile density in the local cloud .",
    "on the basis of this size distribution , _ jones et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) find that collisional shattering is a source of the smallest of these grains , but grains bigger than about 30 nm are rapidly depleted , much faster than they can be replenished by condensation in stellar outflows ( _ jones et al .",

    "we investigate whether collisions with the newly found bigger particles could provide a source for grains bigger than those generated by collisions from the classic interstellar grains alone ( cf .",
    "_ jones et al .",

    "the mass distribution of interstellar grains measured by galileo and ulysses only overlaps with the biggest masses of the classical mrn distribution , and extends to much bigger particles . for this analysis",
    ", we will assume that the mass distribution of the big particles extends to the mass of the observed interstellar radar meteors ( @xmath1 , see _ landgraf et al .",
    "_ , 1999 , for a discussion of the mass distribution observed by spacecraft and radar observations ) . while the grain flux up to @xmath18 is well characterized by spacecraft measurements the meteor flux at about @xmath19 has still large uncertainties",
    "_ landgraf et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) give a cumulative mass flux with a slope of @xmath20 ( corresponding to a @xmath21 slope of the size distribution ) for the ulysses and galileo measurements alone , however , the radar data suggest a significantly flatter slope of the combined mass distribution , and a slope of -4 is compatible with both measurements .",
    "these big particles are mostly hidden from astronomical observations because their contribution to the total cross section for extinction is low .",
    "where do big grains come from ?",
    "since big grains are difficult to observe , here we can only speculate .",
    "stellar outflows ( star dust ) and explosion shells display only small grains that are injected into the interstellar medium .",
    "circumstantial evidence for micron sized and bigger grains outside of our own solar system exists mostly in dust disks around vega type stars ( cf .",
    ". _ backman and paresc _ , 1993 ) .",
    "it is in molecular clouds , star forming regions and , especially , in proto - planetary disks where one would expect grain growth , however , the mechanism by which these large grains escape into the diffuse medium remains unclear .",
    "excess emission at millimeter wavelengths from very cold dust in the galactic plane is interpreted by _ rowan - robinson _ ( 1992 ) to be due to particles of several @xmath22 in size .    in the main part of this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate that the mere existence of a significant number of big particles in parts of the diffuse interstellar medium has locally profound consequences for the evolution of interstellar material .",
    "the big particles masses provide a significant collisional reservoir for smaller particles , in those interstellar regions where big particles are abundant . however , it is not the scope of this paper to develop an evolutionary model of interstellar dust in the local interstellar medium , especially , since source terms for interstellar grains are not considered .",
    "we will make simplifying assumptions for the size distribution and the collision speed in order to arrive at an estimate of the collisional effects of big interstellar grains .",
    "first , we assume a size distribution of big grains that is compatible with that observed by ulysses , and combine it with a standard model of locally unobserved small classic grains .",
    "the consequence of this assumption will be that the results obtained are strictly valid only in regions of space where such a grain size distribution is found .",
    "furthermore , we will assume a constant speed of @xmath23 , as the effective collision speed at which particles of different sizes collide .",
    "this speed is derived from the average speed that supernova shocks travel through the interstellar medium ( cf . _",
    "jones et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "the collisional effects are mitigated by the factor f that is the fraction of total lifetime when grains are exposed to shocks , where @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "while the absolute numbers may be uncertain by a factor 10 , the qualitative results that we emphasize are still valid .",
    "the mass added by the big grains to the local interstellar medium is not violating well founded cosmic abundance arguments . in the discussions portion of the paper",
    ", we will argue that the dust - to - gas mass ratio may vary locally , and that the cosmic abundance needs only to be preserved from averages over large volumes of space .",
    "the mrn size distribution of grains in the diffuse interstellar medium is given by a power law @xmath24 , with slope @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( _ mathis et al .",
    "_ , 1977 ) . in the following",
    ", we will assume @xmath27 , a typical value for the local interstellar medium ( _ frisch et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) .",
    "the grain sizes , a , range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 to @xmath31 ) . in our discussion , we follow a similar discussion by _ grn et al . _ ( 1985 ) for the distribution of interplanetary dust but we use , instead of the size distribution , the mass distribution after assuming spherical particles of density @xmath32 . for mass distributions covering a wide mass range , it is convenient to use the logarithmic differential distribution : @xmath33 with the constant @xmath34    = .9    the new extended mass distribution consists of three parts : a mrn - type distribution ( slope @xmath35 ) for small particles ( about @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) , a distribution with a steeper slope ( @xmath38 ) for bigger particles ( about @xmath39 to @xmath40 ) , and a transition region in between . we have assumed that the slope of the big particle distribution holds up to the size of the radar meteors .",
    "the extended mass distribution is represented by    @xmath41^{\\beta \\delta } da\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the slope for small particles and @xmath44 is the slope for big particles , and @xmath45 controls the transition .",
    "again , we transform this extended distribution to the logarithmic differential distribution :    @xmath46^{\\beta\\delta } \\left ( \\frac{3}{4\\pi\\rho } \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\frac{1}{3 } m^\\frac{1}{3 } d\\!\\log m\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath47 , the transition mass @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the extended distribution is valid from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) .",
    "the cross - section and the mass distributions are given by @xmath54    with @xmath55 , and by @xmath56    fig .",
    "1 shows the mrn and extended mass distributions and their moments : cross section density @xmath57 and mass density @xmath58 distributions .",
    "for the extended distribution , the total mass density is @xmath59 ( mrn : @xmath60 ) and the total cross section density is @xmath61 ( mrn : @xmath62 ) .",
    "the cross section density of the extended distribution is not significantly increased ( @xmath63 ) over that of the mrn distribution and , consequently , the interpretation of extinction measurements at visible and uv wavelengths is not affected .",
    "however , most mass density is contained in the big particles ( the total mass of the extended distribution is about a factor 3.5 increased over that in the mrn distribution ) .",
    "we now determine the effects of mutual collisions in a cloud of interstellar matter like that currently surrounding the solar system . on an average of every few @xmath64 years",
    ", a supernova shock passes through the diffuse medium with relative speeds of about 50 to @xmath65 ( _ jones et al . _ , 1996 ) . the pressure jump and",
    "the entrained magnetic field first accelerates the gas then betatron acceleration causes the small grains , and eventually the bigger grains , to reach their post shock speed . in this way",
    ", relative speeds between grains of various sizes are introduced . in this study , we will focus on the collisional destruction and the generation of fragments by collisions between grains , and we will ignore sputtering of grains by the fast moving gas , which may additionally erode small grains in very fast shocks .",
    "we assume a quasi - stationary situation , by taking into account , only the shock environment where the relative speeds between the grains are of the order of the shock speed .",
    "hence , we will not follow the collisional time evolution of the size distribution , and therefore we assume that the grain size distribution does not change with time .",
    "taking into account that interstellar matter cycles repeatedly through a warm and cold interstellar medium ( where it is effectively shielded from shocks ) , the effective lifetimes may be a factor @xmath5 to @xmath6 times longer than calculated .",
    "in the subsequent section , we follow the collision formulation of _ grn et al . _ ( 1985 ) for interplanetary dust and that of _ jones et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) for interstellar dust .",
    "an important parameter describing the effect of collisions is @xmath66 , the ratio of the target and projectile masses , at which a `` catastrophic '' collision occurs , i.e. a collision that shatters the target particle completely .",
    "_ jones et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) derives this value @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) from first principles for interstellar particles in a shock environment .",
    "_ grn et al . _ ( 1985 ) used values @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) for interplanetary collisions that were derived from laboratory experiments with cm - sized projectiles and basalt targets at impact speeds below @xmath71 . since the _",
    "jones et al .",
    "_ values were derived for the size and speed range applicable to interstellar grains , we use their value ( @xmath72 ) .    during the passage of a supernova shock through the interstellar medium , the relative speeds between particles of different sizes vary over a wide range with the maximum relative speed close to the shock speed itself .",
    "any target particle of a given mass is most effectively destroyed by projectiles that are up to a factor @xmath66 smaller than the target particle .",
    "relative speeds between different massive particles reach shock speed .",
    "even particles of the same mass can get high relative speeds , since shock acceleration is facilitated by the pick - up process , where charged grains gyrate about the moving magnetic field and hence colliding particles can be at different phases of their gyration .",
    "collisional effects are strongly dependent on the collision speed ( see e.g. _ jones et al . _ , 1996 ) , and the highest speeds have the strongest effect .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath73 as the effective speed of all catastrophic collisions during the passage of a shock .    the collision rate @xmath74 of target particles of mass m1 is given by @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the collisional cross section .",
    "= .95    from the collision rate we can determine the mean collisional lifetime @xmath77 of grains of mass @xmath78 : @xmath79    fig .",
    "2 shows that collisional lifetimes for the biggest particles of the mrn distribution ( @xmath3 ) are of order a few @xmath80 years , giving rise to a fast depletion of these particles , and a steepening slope of the mrn distribution as described by _",
    "jones et al . _",
    "the biggest particles of the extended distribution ( @xmath40 ) have lifetimes about 100 times longer than those of the biggest mrn - particles .    in the next step ,",
    "we calculate the mass density destruction rate @xmath81 shattered in catastrophic collisions :    @xmath82    it must be noted that the mass of the colliding particles is not lost , but reappears in the distribution of fragment particles . from laboratory experiments ,",
    "the fragment mass distribution is given by    @xmath83    with @xmath84 ( after _ jones et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) , @xmath85 is the mass of the largest fragment ( we will use a value of @xmath86 of the target mass ) and the constant in equation ( [ eqn_dg ] ) can be evaluated from the conservation of mass ( assuming no significant losses by evaporation ) .",
    "the mass density generation rate @xmath87 of fragments can be calculated from    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the mass of the smallest particle considered as projectiles .",
    "3 shows the mass distributions of the destroyed particles and the generated fragments for the extended distributions .",
    "the total mass shattered ( equals the total mass of generated fragments ) per unit time and volume for the mrn distribution is @xmath90 ) whereas the processed mass for the extended distribution is @xmath91 ) .",
    "= .95    collisions are an effective source of small grains ( cf . _",
    "jones et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) :",
    "more fragments are generated than grains are destroyed in each mass interval below @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the mrn and the extended mass distribution , respectively .",
    "the situation is reversed above these thresholds , however , while bigger grains are rapidly lost from the mrn distribution , the losses from the extended mass distribution are reduced by collisional fragments that are generated up to @xmath18 .",
    "a second consequence of the existence of big interstellar grains in the local interstellar medium is that the gas - to - dust ratio may deviate significantly from that derived from cosmic abundance arguments ( about @xmath92 of the total mass is in refractory dust ; cf . _",
    "frisch et al . _ , 1999 ) . in this section ,",
    "we show that massive dust grains couple to the interstellar gas over much larger distance scales than do the small classic interstellar grains . as a consequence",
    ", the dust - to - gas mass ratio may vary locally ( on scales of a few pc ) , depending on the relative abundance of massive grains , and cosmic abundance arguments are valid only averaged over large volumes of space ( 100 to 1000 pc dimension ) . in the following section , we calculate relevant length scales that govern grains in the diffuse interstellar medium and discuss consequences for the gas - to - dust mass ratio .",
    "again we assume that dust particles move with a speed of @xmath94 with respect to the ambient medium .",
    "this length scale is a lower limit  it could be a factor f longer .",
    "next we calculate the length scales over which interstellar dust couples to other constituents of the ambient diffuse interstellar medium : gas and fields .",
    "the frictional scale ldrag over which the dust couples to the gas ( cf .",
    "_ morfill and grn _ , 1979 ) is given by the path length it takes for the grain to sweep - up its own mass , md , in form of interstellar gas ( hydrogen , @xmath95 ) :      an important scale for an interstellar grain is its coupling to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "we will assume that interstellar particles in the local interstellar medium are charged typically to @xmath97 ( _ grn and svestka _ , 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , their charge is given by @xmath98 , with permittivity , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 in meters .",
    "the gyro radius , @xmath101 , in the ambient magnetic field , @xmath102 ( estimated average value in the local diffuse interstellar medium , _ holzer _ , 1989 ) , is @xmath103    fig .",
    "4 compares the scales for collisional destruction , gas friction , and gyration , assuming that the local condition are representative for the diffuse interstellar medium over a much larger volume .",
    "the shortest scale is the interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "if we further assume that the interstellar magnetic field is coupled to the gas via the ionized component , the gyro radius is the shortest scale over which the dust couples to the gas .",
    "nevertheless , the biggest particles ( @xmath40 ) can travel over about one kpc before they are captured by the magnetic field , and therefore , big particles may be generated several 100 pc from the place where they are found .",
    "it is evident that big particles couple over much larger scales to the ambient diffuse interstellar medium ( gas and fields ) than small particles do , therefore , they may be unrelated to the local gas density and the small particles except via collisions .",
    "consequently the dust - to - gas mass ratio may vary locally , and hence , the cosmic abundance ( about 1only over large scales ( 100 pc to 1 kpc ) .",
    "another consequence of the much longer coupling length of big particles is that there is everywhere a significant relative speed ( of the order of @xmath104 ) between big grains and smaller grains that couple to the local gas .",
    "initial estimates indicate that the collisional effects of this constant grinding may be as important for the generation of small particles as those induced by supernova shocks .",
    "the most important consequences of the big particle population in the local diffuse interstellar medium are that : 1 .",
    "most mass is in big particles , 2 .",
    "massive particles have long collisional lifetimes ( @xmath64 years ) , 3 .",
    "big particles provide a source for small mrn - type particles as long as big grains are present , 4 .",
    "massive grains couple to the gas over length scales of 100 to 1000 pc , 5 .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio varies locally depending on the relative amount of massive particles , 6",
    ". cosmic abundance ratio of gas to dust is only valid over kpc distances .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to draw the attention to effects of big interstellar grains that have not been previously recognized .",
    "a full evolutionary model of interstellar dust in the diffuse interstellar medium is left to future work .",
