    "this opens the path for self - sustaining sensors , power generation from waste heat or a complementary to photovoltaics@xcite . in recent years",
    ", several approaches for different material systems and device layouts have been developed to achieve a high efficiency at low cost.@xcite while the highest efficiencies have been reported for te elements based on inorganic semiconductors , recently , doped polymers gained attention because despite having lower efficiency they have the potential of a strong cost reduction.@xcite additionally , these organic compounds allow for fabrication of te devices on flexible foils which are easier to handle and can e.g.  be installed on large and curved surfaces like in cooling towers .    in this work ,",
    "another class of organic semiconducting compounds is studied : small molecules , which so far have hardly been examined with respect to their te properties , but are predicted to be a promising material class@xcite .",
    "small molecules have the advantage to polymers that due to their low molecular weight they can be deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum , allowing for high material purity and arbitrary layer stacks , while mass production on large substrates via roll - to - roll fabrication is feasible as well .",
    "doping of small molecules has led to novel devices like organic light - emitting diodes ( oleds ) and organic photovoltaic cells.@xcite the electrical conductivity of such doped layers of small molecules typically increases with temperature@xcite , while their thermal conductivity is rather low@xcite .",
    "the scope of this publication is the comparison of the te potential of several material combinations of small molecular hosts and dopants .",
    "it is found that @xmath0-doped c60samples show several orders of magnitude higher power factors , compared to @xmath1-doped hole transporting compounds .",
    "the highest values are obtained for low concentrations of cr2(hpp)4)or high concentrations of in c60 .",
    "the resulting of these first tests for this material class are as high as 16% of the current record reported for optimized devices employing the doped polymer .",
    "samples are prepared and measured in - situin a vacuum setup ( base pressure @xmath2pa ) , which has been described in detail earlier@xcite . a doped organic layer of mostly thickness is deposited by thermal co - deposition of host and dopant onto a glass substrate with two parallel , thick gold contacts of distance .",
    "this sample layout allows for measurement of both , conductivity and seebeck coefficient at different temperatures , because the substrate is mounted onto two separately heated copper blocks below the gold contacts .",
    "all samples are thermally annealed at in vacuum prior to investigation to ensure reproducibility of temperature - dependent measurements .",
    "electrical measurements are performed using a keithley 236 source measure unit . for probing the conductivity ,",
    "a voltage of is applied to the gold contacts and the current flow is measured and averaged over 2 minutes to compensate for statistical fluctuations . as for all samples a linear and symmetric current response is found for @xmath3 to , we assume ohmic injection . for measuring the seebeck coefficient  , a temperature difference of between the gold contacts is used and the thermovoltage is measured and averaged for several minutes , followed by a measurement at to compensate for measurement artifacts . both , and  ,",

    "some of the conductivity and seebeck data presented in this work have been published earlier in the given references , but so far no conclusion for the te properties have been deduced .",
    "the thermoelectric potential of a material is determined by the material s figure of merit @xmath4 with seebeck coefficient  , electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity , measured at the mean temperature .",
    "hence , for te applications , materials of low but high  and are desired .",
    "the numerator @xmath5 in equation  ( [ eq : ztm ] ) is called power factor . doping a semiconducting te material allows for manipulating these parameters .",
    "the presence of dopants leads to an increasing density of free charge carriers and thus along with a reduction of  , due to the shift of the fermi level towards the transport level@xcite . at low doping concentrations ,",
    "the thermal conductivity is attributed to phonons while at high contributions from the electrons dominate .",
    "consequently , the optimum in doping concentration needs to be determined .    for the most extensively studied inorganic te material system bi@xmath6te@xmath7 , record values in the order of at were achieved@xcite , while for the doped polymer recently a promising record of at room temperature has been reported@xcite .",

    "this evaluation is performed for a variety of material combinations and doping concentrations .",
    "data measured at are chosen , because that temperature was most reliable to control for all samples .",

    "-doped by of . ]    for intrinsic c60 , the thermal conductivity has been reported to be almost temperature - independent between 30 and at a value around @xcite , which is 4 orders of magnitude lower than values observed for @xcite .",
    "assuming that is mainly attributed to phonons and hence unaltered by introduction of dopant molecules , the value for intrinsic c60can be used to derive , which is shown by the right hand axes of fig .",

    "however , since in our setup it was impossible to measure at such a large , this work requires a different experimental approach and will be done in future .",
