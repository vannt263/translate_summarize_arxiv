    "let @xmath5 be a hausdorff topological group .",
    "@xmath5 is said to be * amenable * if every jointly continuous action on a compact hausdorff space @xmath6 ( often called a @xmath5-flow ) supports an invariant borel probability measure .",
    "it is normally quite difficult to determine wheter a given topological group @xmath5 is amenable or not .",
    "however , there are some observations we can make to simplify our discussion . if @xmath6 is a @xmath5-flow , a",
    "_ subflow _",
    "@xmath7 is a compact subspace which is invariant under @xmath5-action . using zorn s lemma",
    ", we see that each @xmath5-flow contains a minimal subflow . therefore to show that @xmath5 is amenable",
    ", it is enough to show that every minimal @xmath5-flow supports an invariant borel probability measure .",
    "we can simplify things even further ; if @xmath6 and @xmath8 are @xmath5-flows , we say that @xmath9 is a @xmath5-map if @xmath10 is continuous and @xmath11 for each @xmath12 .",
    "it is a fact that each topological group @xmath5 admits , up to isomorphism , a * universal minimal flow * @xmath13 , a flow which is minimal and such that for any other minimal @xmath5-flow @xmath6 , there is a @xmath5-map @xmath14 ( see [ a ] for further reading ) .",
    "hence by push forward , @xmath5 is amenable if and only if the flow @xmath13 supports an invariant borel probability measure .",
    "kechris , pestov , and todorcevic in [ kpt ] provided a way of explicitly describing @xmath13 in many instances where @xmath5 is the automorphism group of a frass structure .",
    "we will discuss this in much more detail in section 2 .",
    "in particular , having a concrete representation of @xmath13 allows one to address questions of amenability .",
    "kechris and soki in [ ks ] take advantage of this to show that the automorphism groups of the random poset and the random distributive lattice are not amenable .    indeed , amenability is not the only property of topological groups @xmath5 for which is it sufficient to verify a property only for the flow @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath5 is said to be * uniquely ergodic * if each minimal @xmath5-flow supports a unique invariant borel probability measure , and @xmath5 is said to have the * generic point property * if for each minimal flow @xmath6 , there is @xmath12 with @xmath15 comeager in @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth noting that any comeager orbit must be unique since the intersection of two comeager sets is comeager , hence nonempty . as promised , @xmath5 is uniquely ergodic iff @xmath13 supports a unique invariant borel probability measure , and @xmath5 has the generic point property iff there is @xmath16 with @xmath15 comeager .",
    "these two definitions provide us with two notions of a canonical choice of `` large '' subset of @xmath13 , namely the support of the unique measure and the comeager orbit . in all examples of groups previously shown to be uniquely ergodic and to have the generic point property , the measure was in fact supported on the generic orbit .",
    "angel , kechris , and lyons in [ akl ] asked whether this phenomenon holds generally .",
    "this paper is divided into two main parts .",
    "the first half generalizes the methods in [ ks ] and finds a necessary and sufficient condition for those groups whose universal minimal flows can be described using the methods of [ kpt ] to be amenable .",
    "armed with this condition , we consider the ultrahomogeneous directed graph @xmath0 and the boron tree structure @xmath1 , which are defined in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we show that :    the groups @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not amenable .    the second half answers in the negative the question of angel , kechris , and lyons by exhibiting the following counterexample ; fix a finite field @xmath4 , and let @xmath3 be the countably infinite vector space over @xmath4 . in section 6 ,",
    "we prove :    the unique invariant measure on @xmath19 is not supported on the generic orbit .    of course",
    ", after asserting where the unique measure in this example is _ not _ supported , it is natural to ask where it is supported .",
    "this is the focus of sections 7 and 8 .",
    "i would like to thank alekos kechris , miodrag soki , and anush tserunyan for many helpful discussions and comments , as well as ola kwiatkowska and robin tucker - drob for patiently lending an ear .",

    "our investigations above lend themselves to a number of open questions :      assume the frass class @xmath44 admits a companion @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath59 be the frass limit of @xmath44 . if @xmath92 is uniquely ergodic , what are necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique measure on any minimal flow to be supported on the generic orbit ?",
    "pongrcz in [ p ] has given a partial answer to question 8.2 .",
    "let @xmath782 , for @xmath453 a symbol for a linear ordering and @xmath23 * relational*. let @xmath85 be an excellent pair of frass classes in @xmath23 and @xmath783 .",
    "suppose @xmath80 is order forgetful , i.e.  for @xmath784 , we have @xmath785 .",
    "we see that @xmath92 , if amenable , is uniquely ergodic , and the measure satisfies @xmath786 ( see the introduction ) .",
    "pongrcz has shown that in this case , @xmath141 is supported generically .",
    "note that this does not contradict theorem 1.2 ; every hypothesis of pongrcz s theorem is satisfied except that the language of vector spaces contains function symbols .",
    "his calculations also shed some light on the role that functions play in my calculations for @xmath3 , and they also suggest that we may be able to find relational examples with @xmath787 with the measure @xmath141 as above not supported generically .      to make question 9.3 more precise , consider what was shown in sections 7 and 8 .",
    "though no single orbit has positive measure , it seems that by taking a suitable completion of @xmath3 , the unique measure concentrates on the isomorphism type of @xmath788 ordered lexicographically . in what sense",
