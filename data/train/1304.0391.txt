    "homology -spheres , then the analogous question is open ; our theorem  [ thm : ihs ] answers affirmatively a weakened version of this question .",
    "the manifolds of @xcite came from a tower of congruence covers of a fixed base manifold , and it seems unlikely this method would work for integer homology -spheres as we now describe .",
    "recently , number theorists have become interested in torsion in the homology of arithmetic groups @xcite .",
    "specifically , bergeron and venkatesh posited the following as part of an intriguing general conjecture for arithmetic lattices in semisimple lie groups ; in the present context of hyperbolic 3-manifolds , le independently formulated a closely related conjecture , see @xcite for details .",
    "[ conj : bv ] let @xmath2 be a closed congruence arithmetic hyperbolic -manifold , and @xmath11 a tower of congruence covers where @xmath12 .",
    "then the size of the torsion subgroup of @xmath13 grows exponentially in @xmath14 and moreover @xmath15    in particular , if this conjecture holds then the approach of @xcite which used exactly such a tower to answer cooper s question can not be modified to prove theorem  [ thm : ihs ] .",
    "one of two key parts to conjecture  [ conj : bv ] is the expected convergence of ray - singer analytic torsion in such a tower of covers .",
    "more precisely , the logarithm of the analytic torsion of a riemannian manifold @xmath2 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the laplacian on smooth @xmath18-forms and @xmath19 is the zeta - regularized product of nonzero eigenvalues ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) .",
    "then for covers @xmath20 as in conjecture  [ conj : bv ] , part of ( [ eqn : l2tor ] ) is that one should have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath1-analytic torsion of @xmath0 .",

    "were able to show that this notion of geometric convergence also implies convergence of part of the topology :    [ thm : localconv ] let @xmath20 be a sequence of closed hyperbolic -manifolds which benjamini - schramm converge to @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath28    here , the @xmath29 in the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : l2betti ] ) should be interpreted as the first @xmath1betti number of @xmath0 , and the moral of theorem  [ thm : localconv ] is that suitable local convergence of the geometry of the @xmath20 leads to convergence of their normalized betti numbers to the corresponding @xmath1betti number of their common universal cover .",
    "theorem  [ thm : localconv ] generalizes results of lck and lott @xcite which apply only to @xmath20 coming from finite covers of a fixed manifold ( as in conjecture  [ conj : bv ] ) .",
    "a key consequence of theorem  [ thm : ihs ] is that theorem  [ thm : localconv ] does not have an analog for analytic torsion :    [ cor : tornonconverge ] there exist closed hyperbolic -manifolds @xmath20 which benjamini - schramm converge to @xmath0 where @xmath30 as @xmath27 . in particular , the limit is not @xmath31 .",
    "thus , while the geometric notion of benjamini - schramm convergence is enough to control the convergence of ( normalized ) betti - numbers to the corresponding @xmath1 invariant of the limit , the same is not true for torsion .",
    "corollary  [ cor : tornonconverge ] limits how much one can broaden conjecture  [ conj : bv ] , and in this narrow sense could be taken as evidence against conjecture  [ conj : bv ] .",

    "our experiments complement prior work of engn  @xcite and page @xcite . to frame our results ,",
    "we need to expand on the connection between conjecture  [ conj : bv ] and analytic torsion . for a closed riemannian -manifold ,",
    "the cheeger - mller theorem @xcite implies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that @xmath32 here the regulator of @xmath33 is the covolume of the lattice @xmath34 in @xmath35 , where the latter has the inner product coming from its identification with the set of harmonic forms .",
    "the first part of conjecture  [ conj : bv ] is that @xmath36 and the second is that @xmath37 . in section  [ sec : exp ] , we provide evidence in favor of a broadening of the first part conjecture  [ conj : bv ] to _ all _ hyperbolic -manifolds :    [ conj : gentor ] let @xmath20 be covers of a fixed closed hyperbolic -manifold @xmath2 which benjamini - schramm converge to @xmath0 . then @xmath38 .",
    "in contrast , it is not expected that @xmath39 for nonarithmetic manifolds ; we give data in support of this , see especially figure  [ nonarithg ] . for arithmetic manifolds , experiments of engn",
    "@xcite identified the case of congruence covers of prime - power level as a place where such convergence appears to be slowest , to the point where one hits computational limits before getting convincing evidence for or against conjecture  [ conj : bv ] . in section",
    "[ sec : exp ] , we investigate several families of examples of this type .",
    "while some of these remain ambiguous , overall they provide additional evidence that @xmath40 even in this case .      given a homeomorphism @xmath41 of a surface @xmath42 there are two natural 3-manifolds we can build from it .",
    "one is the mapping torus @xmath43 , which fibers over the circle .",
    "alternatively , we can identify @xmath42 with the boundary of a handlebody @xmath44 and consider the associated heegaard splitting : @xmath45 . while the natural copies of @xmath42 in @xmath43 and @xmath46 are radically different topologically ( the first is incompressible and the other maximally compressible ) , the philosophy of kleinian groups , specifically @xcite , indicates that in favorable conditions on @xmath41 , and for large powers @xmath47 , there are large chunks of the geometry of @xmath48 and @xmath49 that are nearly isometric .",
    "here is the basic idea behind the manifolds in theorem  [ thm : ihs ] .",
    "fixing @xmath25 , it is easy to construct @xmath50 so that @xmath43 has @xmath51 .",
    "now for @xmath43 we have @xmath52 , and in particular @xmath43 is not a homology sphere .",
    "however , we will `` photocopy '' its geometry onto a heegaard splitting whose homology we can independently control .",
    "specifically , choose homeomorphisms @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xmath42 so that @xmath55 and @xmath54 acts trivially on @xmath56 . then define @xmath20 to be the heegaard splitting associated to @xmath57 .",
    "this @xmath20 is an integral homology sphere since the gluing map acts on @xmath58 precisely as @xmath53 does .",
    "we show that @xmath41 and @xmath54 can be chosen so that when @xmath47 is large , most of the geometry of @xmath20 is locally nearly isometric to @xmath43 and hence @xmath59 on most of @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , the volume of @xmath60 is uniformly bounded whereas @xmath61 ; hence we can make the ratio @xmath62 , as required by theorem  [ thm : ihs ] .",
    "in realizing this outline , there are several different routes one could take through the machinery of kleinian groups .",
    "we choose one which only uses results about manifolds with incompressible boundary and bounded geometry .",
    "moreover , unlike the corresponding parts of @xcite , our argument does not rely on @xcite .",
    "one very natural question is whether there are integral homology 3-spheres where the injectivity radius is large everywhere . from the point of view in the discussion in sections",
    "[ sec : context ] and [ sec : bs ] , in fact it would be very interesting if one could add to theorem  [ thm : ihs ] a _ uniform _ lower bound on @xmath63 independent of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
