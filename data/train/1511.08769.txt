    "there is an obvious tension between the above requirements .",
    "while efficient algorithms are needed to estimate a large number of parameters , the maximum likelihood method often requires to solve np - hard combinatorial optimizations . a flourishing line of work addresses this conundrum by designing effective convex relaxations of these combinatorial problems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the statistical properties of such convex relaxations are well understood only in a few cases ( compressed sensing being the most important success story @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we use tools from statistical mechanics to develop a precise picture of the behavior of a class of semidefinite programming relaxations .",
    "relaxations of this type appear to be surprisingly effective in a variety of problems ranging from clustering to graph synchronization . for the sake of concreteness",
    "we will focus on three specific problems :    * @xmath0-synchronization . * in the general synchronization problem , we aim at estimating @xmath1 which are unknown elements of a known group @xmath2 .",
    "this is done using data that consists of noisy observations of ` relative positions ' @xmath3 .",
    "a large number of practical problems can be modeled in this framework .",
    "for instance , the case @xmath4 ( the orthogonal group in three dimensions ) is relevant for camera registration , and molecule structure reconstruction in electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-synchronization problem is arguably the simplest problem in this class , and corresponds to @xmath5 ( the group of integers modulo @xmath6 ) . without loss of generality",
