    "attempts to understand stress distribution in static , non - cohesive , granular materials have uncovered a rich structure of force chains that currently is poorly understood @xcite .",
    "although mechanical systems such as bead or granular packings subject to uniaxial compression seem straightforward , they harbor fundamental theoretical challenges concerning the connection between the micro and macro scales . such systems are far from thermal equilibrium since thermal energy scales are negligible compared to the potential energies stored in elastic deformation of the grains . in addition , the force between grains is strongly nonlinear , as it vanishes identically when the grains are not in contact .    in this paper , we report results and analyses of a toy model for the compaction of a granular material .",
    "our model consists of `` grains '' placed on a square lattice and connected by vertical springs .",
    "the grains are constrained to move only in the vertical direction , so the model treats forces and stresses as _ scalar _ quantities .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . ) geometric disorder is introduced in the model by assigning to each spring an equilibrium length drawn randomly from a square distribution .",
    "though we can not hope to capture the true physics of tensorial stresses in this manner , we can study the validity of arguments that have been applied to real granular systems and should equally well apply to our toy model .",
    "in particular , we compare the distribution of inter - grain forces generated by our model to the distribution predicted by the @xmath0-model  of coppersmith et al @xcite , and we compare the stress - strain power law generated by our model to that expected on the basis of a mean - field argument .",
    "our results provide a warning : in neither case are the theoretical predictions borne out by the numerics .",
    "the structure of our model is shown in fig .  [ fig : model ] .",
    "grains are placed at the even - parity sites of a @xmath1 cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to such a system as an `` @xmath3 '' system . excluding the sites on the lower boundary",
    ", it contains @xmath4 grains .",
    "grains are constrained to move only in the vertical direction , as if sliding on fixed , frictionless wires ( shown as thin lines in the figure ) .",
    "we let @xmath5 denote the vertical displacement of the grain at lattice site @xmath6 from its nominal height @xmath7 , with @xmath8 for upward displacements . between every two nearest - neighbor grains",
    "there is a vertical spring .",
    "all of the springs respond linearly under compression , with spring constant @xmath9 , but they produce no force under extension .",
    "the energy of the spring between grains @xmath10 and @xmath11 is taken to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent , quenched random variables designating the different uncompressed lengths of the springs .",
    "we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be distributed uniformly over the interval @xmath15 .",
    "note that when @xmath16 , the uncompressed spring has length @xmath2 , the lattice constant .",
    "one may imagine the grains to have arbitrary shapes and the uncompressed spring length to be the vertical spacing between grain centers when the grains are just barely in contact .",
    "the system is taken to satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "all grains at the top are constrained from above by a rigid `` ceiling '' and therefore satisfy @xmath17 . on the bottom row , grains are constrained by a rigid `` floor '' whose height @xmath18 is an independent variable ; thus @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the maximum value of @xmath18 such that no springs are compressed .",
    "typically @xmath20 , which is a function of the random @xmath21 s , is negative and of the order of @xmath22 in absolute value .",
    "( it can not be less than @xmath23 . ) below we measure the floor height in terms of the incremental variable @xmath24 .",
    "though we use the terms `` floor '' , `` vertical '' , etc . , for convenience , there is no gravity in the model and there is complete statistical symmetry between the up and down directions .",
    "the algorithm discussed below for determining equilibrium configurations explicitly breaks this symmetry , though the configurations it produces do not .",
    "our model apparently depends on the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath9 , but these merely set the scales for distance and force . for the rest of this paper , numerical values for distances",
    " spring - length variations @xmath21 , grain displacements @xmath5 , and boundary displacement @xmath26  will be quoted in units of @xmath25 ; and forces  individual forces @xmath27 and the total force @xmath28 on the ceiling  in units of @xmath29 .",
    "although the _ width _ of the distribution of spring lengths scales out of the problem , its _ shape _ could conceivably make a difference .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect the precise shape to be important as long as the probability of having very large uncompressed lengths decays sufficiently rapidly . in any event , we consider only the square distribution .",
    "let us contrast the alternative of random spring constants with the random equilibrium lengths we study here .",
    "if the @xmath9 s were random but all equilibrium lengths were equal , then as @xmath26 increased all the springs would begin to be compressed simultaneously at @xmath30 and the system would be perfectly linear for all @xmath31 ; the force - vs .- displacement law would be @xmath32 for @xmath31 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant determined by the random @xmath9 s . by contrast , with random spring lengths we capture some of the geometric disorder of real granular materials , which inevitably introduces nonlinearities associated with the formation of new contacts during compression .",
    "we will refer to a spring under compression as an `` active bond '' , and to a site connected to such a spring as an `` active site . ''",
    "an equilibrium configuration for @xmath26 positive , but not too large , has a mixture of active and inactive sites and bonds . for a given set of @xmath21 s ,",
    "the equilibrium configuration of active sites and bonds is unique , although the exact positions of inactive sites are not determined .",
    "this uniqueness follows from the strict convexity of the total energy as a function of the lengths of active bonds .",
    "[ fig : configs ] shows three equilibrium configurations with the same set of @xmath21 s on a @xmath36 lattice , for different amounts of compression .",
    "only the active bonds are shown , with line thickness proportional to the force transmitted .",
    "also shown are two bars representing the ceiling and the floor .",
    "let @xmath37 be the total force exerted by the system on the ceiling .",
    "[ fig : onecurve ] shows a typical force curve for a @xmath36 system , together with the fractions of sites and bonds that are activated .",
    "elementary considerations reveal the limiting behaviors of @xmath28 for large and small @xmath26 . for very small",
    "@xmath26 , the force on the ceiling is due to a single chain of activated springs that reaches from top to bottom .",
    "this chain , which follows the directed path @xmath38 through the lattice that yields the highest value of @xmath39 , produces a force linear in @xmath26 : @xmath40 when @xmath26 is very large , all of the springs in the system are compressed .",
    "the system is then again entirely linear : because all of the springs have the same stiffness , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a ( negative ) constant that depends on the random @xmath21 s and is difficult to compute .    in general , as @xmath26",
    "is increased from zero , additional chains are activated and @xmath37 increases .",
    "in fact it can be shown that @xmath28 must increase monotonically with @xmath26 .",
    "( this is why @xmath42 must be negative . )",
    "surprisingly , however , the slope of @xmath37 may _ decrease _ with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "occasionally bonds that are active at small values of @xmath26 become inactive for larger @xmath26 , thus reducing the effective spring constant of the network .",
    "the simplest example of this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : break ] .",
    "the figure shows a sequence of configurations in which the central bond is originally active , but becomes inactive due to the effective stiffening of other parts of the network when additional bonds are activated .",
    "the algorithm we employ for generating equilibrium configurations of our model relies heavily on the fact that for a given set of active bonds , the system response is linear . by solving for the times at which inactive bonds are activated during compression",
    ", the algorithm generates the entire curve @xmath37 , starting from @xmath43 and explicitly visiting every configuration . to construct the initial , uncompressed configuration ,",
    "we begin with @xmath44 for all @xmath45 and march up layer by layer applying the rule @xmath46 this configuration can be thought of as the packing that would result from an infinitesimal gravitational force acting on the system .",
    "( strictly speaking , we set @xmath47 , march upward , determine @xmath20 from the height reached , and translate all displacements accordingly . )    a typical initial configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trees ] .",
    "sites joined by line segments are separated precisely by the equilibrium length of the spring between them .",
    "springs that are not long enough to connect their two sites are not drawn .",
    "already one can see that there is a rich geometric structure hidden in this model , quite similar to that described by roux et al @xcite .",
    "the heavy lines in the figure highlight structures we call `` trees '' , consisting of all sites that are connected to the same site on the first layer .",
    "we refer to the distance between the upper end of an _ inactive _ spring and the site to which it will eventually connect as a `` gap '' .",
    "note that sizes of the gaps reflect the structure of our initialization algorithm .",
    "we have moved all the grains to their lowest possible position , concentrating all of the small gaps that might be present in a chain into a single large gap at the top of a branch of a tree .    to generate the force curve ,",
    "we maintain a list of active sites and their active bonds , and we keep track of changes in the tree structure of the uncompressed chains as the floor is raised . for any fixed set of active bonds ,",
    "the @xmath5 s increase linearly with @xmath26 , since all of the active springs are linear .",
    "it is therefore a straightforward linear problem to solve for the rate , @xmath48 , at which each @xmath5 advances .",
    "advancing @xmath26 through one stage involves solving for @xmath5 for some arbitrary increase in @xmath26 , for which we employ an iterative biconjugate gradient routine @xcite , using the current configuration of @xmath5 s as an initial guess for the solution .",
    "the solution is used to determine the rates of advance of all the active sites .",
    "the rate of advance of each inactive site is equal to that of the active site that supports it through an uncompressed chain .",
    "the rates are used to determine the value of @xmath26 at which the network topology changes .",
    "the @xmath5 s are then updated according to the calculated rates , the list of active sites or the tree structure is updated , and the process is repeated .",
    "the updating of the network topology is necessitated either by the closure of a gap or by the breaking of a bond .",
    "the closure of a gap can generate one of two types of events .",
    "first , it can cause an additional set of sites to be activated , which increases the size of our active site list ( and also increases the size of the linear problem that must be solved on the next iteration ) .",
    "second , it can result in a `` push '' event , in which an inactive branch of one tree is simply transferred to another tree without becoming active .",
    "pushes dominate the behavior of the system in the early stages of compression , becoming more and more rare as compression continues and the number of inactive sites decreases .",
    "the breaking of a bond , as mentioned in section  [ subsec : features ] , is the final possibility for changing the network of active bonds .",
    "breaks are generally rare events . during full compression of a @xmath36 system , which undergoes approximately 2000 events ( pushes , chain additions , breaks ) ,",
    "there are typically about 5 breaks .",
    "the algorithm reaches completion when all bonds have been activated . as explained above , further compression would be homogeneous with all @xmath27 s increasing at precisely the same rate . to compress one configuration on a 40x40 lattice , generating one complete force curve ,",
    "requires approximately one hour of computation on a typical 200mhz workstation .",
    "we have accumulated data for various lattices with at most a few thousand sites .",
    "future efforts to optimize the algorithm should permit investigation of substantially larger lattices .    despite our reliance on linear methods for evolving the system between gap events , it must be emphasized that the absence of tensile forces introduces a strong nonlinearity for larger increments in @xmath26 .",
    "an alternative approach to following the entire evolution of the system would be to solve directly for the configuration of the system at an arbitrarily chosen value of @xmath26 by minimizing the nonlinear energy function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eij ] ) . such an approach might speed up the calculation even with linear springs , and it would be essential if the springs were nonlinear ( e.g. hertzian ) under compression .",
    "fig  [ fig : forcecurves ] displays numerically computed curves of @xmath28 vs. @xmath26 for a few rectangular systems of various sizes . at a cursory level , the force curves appear to have the form @xmath49 , which correspond to lines of slope @xmath50 on our log - log plots .",
    "interestingly , this exponent depends strongly on system geometry .    closer inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves ] reveals both expected and unexpected behavior . for any particular realization of the disorder",
    ", there is a region , sometimes substantial , on the log - log plot for small values of @xmath26 in which the force curve appears nearly linear because it is dominated by a single chain .",
    "there is also a crossover to linear behavior for large @xmath26 since , as the fraction of active bonds approaches unity , the system approaches the linear limit described in previous sections .",
    "the intermediate regime is the one of interest , and the behavior there is rather complex . in",
    "many runs an exponent @xmath51 in the intermediate regime can be readily identified .",
    "however , in other runs ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]c ) , small - system statistics tend to obscure the phenomena .",
    "it appears that completely reliable measurements of the exponents in the various regimes will require bigger systems , beyond the reach of our current numerical codes .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the results for systems of a few thousand grains support the conclusions drawn below .",
    "( see ref  @xcite for a discussion of a closely related model . )    in studying force curves for bead packs , several authors have proposed a mean - field argument suggesting that for various granular systems one should observe @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the exponent of the single - contact force law .",
    "thus for our model the mean - field theory predicts @xmath54 .",
    "( for the reader s convenience , we summarize a version of the theory in the appendix .",
    "the treatment there is similar to that of references  @xcite and  @xcite . )",
    "the argument is based on the assumption that the rates at which pairs of nearest neighbor sites approach each other may all be taken to be equal to the average rate of compression .    in subsection c below",
    "we present numerical results for our model showing that @xmath50 can be significantly less than 2 for some system geometries and in subsection d we seek to explain the failure of the mean - field argument . in our view , this failure casts doubt on the argument s applicability to real granular systems .",
    "useful supplementary information is covered in subsections  b and  e.      it is instructive to consider two cases for which the force curves can be explicitly calculated .    _ case 1 : _",
    "this system consists of only a single layer of random - length springs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitmodels]a . assuming the equilibrium spring lengths to be uniformly distributed in a finite interval , one immediately obtains @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the mean - field argument ( appendix a ) is exact , as all gaps do close at the same rate .",
    "_ case 2 : _ @xmath57 . because of the periodic boundary conditions , this case is equivalent to a single column of grains without periodic boundary conditions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitmodels]b .",
    "again we take the distribution of equilibrium lengths to be a square distribution of width @xmath58 . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to fix the force @xmath28 and compute the displacement @xmath59 since the compressive stress on each grain must be the same .",
    "let us decompose the displacement @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the displacement of the @xmath62th spring .",
    "when @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 for each @xmath62 , the longer spring at each level being just at the threshold of compression .",
    "the growth of @xmath61 with @xmath28 depends only on @xmath65 , the difference between the equilibrium lengths of the two springs in the @xmath62th layer .",
    "specifically , @xmath66 note that the @xmath65 s are independent and all have the probability density @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "the expected value of @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 using the fact that all the terms in the summation are equal and performing the integration , we obtain @xmath71 , which in turn may be integrated to yield @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the nondimensionalized displacement and force per layer , respectively .",
    "( [ eq : averagedelta ] ) shows that , in this case , there is no simple power - law behavior in the large @xmath75 limit .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : averagedelta ] ) is approximately linear near @xmath76 ( i.e. , @xmath77 = 1 $ ] ) , and it is linear near and beyond @xmath78 .",
    "if we attempt to identify a single power law for intermediate values of @xmath79 , the natural choice is the derivative @xmath80 , evaluated at the point where this quantity is most slowly varying ; i.e. , where @xmath81 vanishes .",
    "this method yields @xmath82 with @xmath83 , where we have returned to displacement as the independent variable .",
    "the analysis of case 2 shows that it is possible for the force curve to exhibit a region corresponding to a power less than 2 .",
    "it also shows that the emergence of a true power law should not be taken for granted in these systems .",
    "we find , however , that in sufficiently wide systems , a power law does arise ( cf .",
    "discussion below ) .",
    "_ short , wide systems : _ fig.[fig : forcecurves]a shows two typical force curves for an @xmath84 system .",
    "it appears here that there is a regime in which @xmath85 , followed by the expected crossover to @xmath86 at large @xmath26 .",
    "this observation lends some support to the mean field argument and is consistent with the claim of gilabert et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the electrical analogue of our model .",
    "( see section  [ sec : electrical ] below . )    _ tall , narrow systems : _ in a @xmath87 system , the exponent @xmath50 appears to shift noticeably .",
    "the best fit to the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]b is @xmath88 in the intermediate regime of interest . the error in this measurement is estimated to be @xmath89 on the basis of fits made with different choices for which points to exclude from the intermediate regime .",
    "the data clearly rule out @xmath54 .",
    "_ roughly square system : _ an estimate of @xmath90 is obtained from data on @xmath36 systems .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]c shows data from two @xmath36 systems .",
    "the apparent lack of consistent behavior is presumably due to finite size effects .",
    "nevertheless , using data from 25 runs , an estimate of @xmath90 can be obtained as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]d . to obtain the dotted line in the figure ,",
    "the data in the intermediate regime were fit to a power - law ; data from the initial linear regime and data from the two largest forces in the figure ( where we expect a crossover to linear growth ) were excluded in making this estimate for the exponent @xmath50 .",
    "we suggest that the variation of exponent with aspect ratio can be traced to the tree structure in the system .",
    "specifically , we conjecture that if most of the force is transmitted within a single tree , then a smaller exponent will be observed , whereas if the force is spread over many trees , a larger exponent .",
    "we interpret the following numerical experiment as support for this conjecture . starting with a @xmath91 grid",
    ", we removed all sites lying outside the @xmath92 cone emanating from the center of the bottom boundary .",
    "we then measured @xmath37 for this reduced system . in this geometry all the active sites at every stage of compression are connected to the floor at the same point , so all the active bonds are contained within a single tree . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]e the exponent @xmath50 is close to @xmath93 , indicating that the behavior within a single tree has a different character than in a system with many trees .    to explore this issue",
    "further , we measured the rate at which trees expand as a function of height _ in the initial configuration_. ( roux et al . have investigated a similar , but not identical , model @xcite . ) while building the initial configuration , we keep track of the root of the tree associated to each site , thereby counting the number @xmath94 of trees that survive up to layer @xmath95 . since only initial configurations are involved",
    " not their subsequent evolution  rather large systems can be simulated . for a system of width 50,000 with data collected for up to @xmath96 layers , we obtained an excellent power law fit @xmath97 , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with only a slight deviation for very small heights ( @xmath100 ) and very large heights ( corresponding to @xmath101 ) .",
    "note that @xmath102 .",
    "( incidentally , since @xmath103 , it is clear that the power law fit must be inaccurate for @xmath95 of order @xmath104 .",
    ") generalizing from this system to one of arbitrary width , we estimate that in the initial configuration of an @xmath3 system , approximately @xmath105 trees will reach the top layer .",
    "let us speculate on possible consequences of this estimate .",
    "the rates of advance of all sites within a single tree are correlated , since compression of the bottom bond of the tree affects the rates of all the branches above it .",
    "we therefore expect the sequence of gap closings to depend upon the initial tree structure .",
    "assuming that the system obeys a simple anisotropic scaling law , we conjecture that in large systems the exponent @xmath50 is a function of @xmath106 alone .",
    "limited support for this conjecture comes from two additional runs on @xmath107 and @xmath108 systems . in both cases , @xmath109 , and in both cases",
    "we observe power - law behavior with @xmath110 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]f .",
    "a more rigorous test would require runs on significantly larger systems , for which a more efficient code is needed .",
    "note that the @xmath108 system was already too large for us to run to completion ; the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves]f ends well before the crossover to the linear regime occurs .",
    "note also that in the @xmath108 system , a clean power - law regime extends over at least two decades in @xmath26 and three decades in @xmath28 , giving us some confidence that a true power - law regime does exist in large systems .",
    "a consequence of our scaling conjecture is that increasing the system size while keeping the aspect ratio _ fixed _ should result in exponents that eventually approach that of a wide , short system . as we have shown that @xmath54 in the @xmath111 limit ( case 1 , section  ivb ) , we expect to observe the mean - field result @xmath54 in very large , approximately square systems as well .",
    "the key assumption in the mean - field argument is that nearest neighbor sites approach each other at the mean compression rate . in terms of the probability density for inter - site distances ,",
    "the assumption is expressed quantitatively in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pxdelta ] ) of the appendix . which asserts that the shape and width of the distribution of inter - site distances are independent of the compression @xmath112 .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , in our model the probability density @xmath113 is well defined only for @xmath114 ; i.e. , for bonds whose springs are compressed .",
    "however , even restricting our attention to the active bonds , we find that our data are inconsistent with the above assumption .",
    "specifically , in fig .  [ fig : pofx]a we show the probability densities for the ( nonzero ) forces @xmath79 , where @xmath115 , at various stages of compression of a @xmath36 system , and it is clear that the distribution broadens as @xmath116 increases .",
    "more quantitatively , in fig .  [",
    "fig : pofx]b we plot the widths of the best fits to the data by gaussian distributions restricted to @xmath117 , for several values of @xmath116 .",
    "the broadening of @xmath113 , which occurs during the early and intermediate regime of compression , is a simple consequence of force balance at branching points of chains of active bonds .",
    "consider a site at which three active bonds meet , forming a `` y '' ( either right - side - up or upside - down ) . because there are no tensile forces , the force in the unpaired branch of the y is greater than either of those in the paired branches .",
    "moreover , as the y is further compressed , the rate at which the force in the unpaired branch increases must equal the _ sum _ of the rates of increase of the forces in the paired branches . since the larger force evidently increases more rapidly than the two smaller forces ( the forces almost always being increasing functions of @xmath26 )",
    ", the distribution broadens .    during the late regime of compression",
    ", the addition of active bonds will convert y s to x s , for which any correlation between force and bond compression rate must be more subtle . indeed , when all of the bonds are activated , all bonds compress at exactly the same rate and the force distribution simply shifts uniformly to higher forces  the mean field assumption becomes exact .",
    "thus we expect to observe a broadening of the force distribution during early and intermediate stages of compression , with a rate that decreases as the density of y s becomes smaller .",
    "this is precisely the behavior displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pofx ] , where the width of the positive @xmath118 portion of the distribution is seen to grow roughly as a power of @xmath26 less than unity for small @xmath26 and level off at high compression . a quantitative calculation of the rate of broadening would require a detailed understanding of the statistics of branching in the active network and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "let us argue that the broadening of the force distribution generically leads to an exponent @xmath50 smaller than the mean field value .",
    "suppose , for definiteness , that @xmath113 has a sharp leading edge at @xmath119 ; i.e. , that @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 is bounded away from zero . the existence of y s in the active bond network leads to an advance of the leading edge @xmath119 that is more rapid than the advance of @xmath116 itself . taking into account the formation of new contacts and branch points during compression , and assuming simple asymptotic behavior",
    ", we expect that @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "@xcite thus , to lowest order in @xmath116 , we find @xmath125 , and therefore @xmath126 .",
    "corrections to this exponent should become significant for @xmath116 of order unity , which is also the order of the width of @xmath127 .",
    "this expectation is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecurves ] , where it can be seen that the crossover to the linear regime for large @xmath26 occurs for @xmath128 , which is the last half decade in the plots .",
    "these qualitative results do not depend on the linearity ( under compression ) of the springs in our model , nor do they depend on the dimensionality of the model .",
    "they should also apply to the _ vertical _ forces in a system with horizontal degrees of freedom , providing only that the creation of new branch points is sufficiently common .",
    "thus the mean - field argument seems problematic for physical bead packs .",
    "the analysis shows that new contact formation can lead to exponents smaller than the mean field value , an important point in light of other mechanisms proposed to explain experimental observations of this exponent .",
    "@xcite      the analogy between the elastic properties of a network of linear springs and the electrical properties of the same network of resistors has been exploited in numerous studies @xcite . in order to clarify the relation between our model and others , and particularly with random networks near the directed percolation threshold ,",
    "let us consider the analogy in some detail .",
    "we will see that there are good reasons to be skeptical of the applicability of percolation model results to our model , but there is also an intriguing numerical coincidence .",
    "there is a formal identity between our equations for mechanical equilibrium @xmath129 and the electrical equations @xmath130 in the latter equation , @xmath131 specifies the current between sites that are joined by a resistance @xmath132 in series with a battery generating a potential difference @xmath133 .",
    "note that the resistors conductance plays the role of the springs stiffness .",
    "the property that the springs function only under compression can be modeled in the electrical system by the insertion of perfect diodes , all directed `` downward '' , in series with each resistor .",
    "roux et al . studied this very model @xcite , but did not report results for varying aspect ratios or single trees and did not study its relation to the @xmath0-model , which had not yet been introduced .",
    "a system with batteries is substantially more complicated than a simple , randomly diluted resistor - diode network .",
    "to relate the randomly diluted network at the directed percolation threshold to our model just beyond the initial linear regime , one must first assume that the network of active springs in our model has the same structure as the current carrying paths in a directed network of resistors placed at random on the lattice .",

    "the natural assumption here would be that the probability @xmath135 is proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath136 is the critical value for percolation , since @xmath43 is the point where a single force chain ( or current carrying path ) first forms and on average the bonds in our model are compressed by an amount proportional to @xmath26 @xcite . in our system , however , the batteries play two roles .",

    "further study of the model is needed , especially simulations of larger systems , but already two important facts have been established .",

    "( 2 ) depending on the ( properly scaled ) aspect ratio , new contact formation may play a decisive role in determining the macroscopic stress - strain relationship , with sufficiently tall systems showing power - law behavior with a nontrivial exponent . regarding ( 1 ) ,",
    "we have identified two important effects : ( i ) the distribution of forces broadens under compression because of force balance constraints at sites where three active bonds meet ; and ( ii ) larger forces tend to divide more evenly between supporting grains as a result of the dynamical process that determines the structure of the active bond network .",
    "theories that neglect these correlations fail when applied to our model",
    ".    one may wonder whether qualitatively new features might appear in a 3d generalization of our model in which the vertical direction is taken to be the 111 direction of a simple cubic lattice . as a preliminary check ,",
    "we have measured the statistics of trees in the initial configuration and observed their general morphology .",
    "the number of surviving trees decays as @xmath154 and the trees remain relatively compact . in other words ,",
    "the diameter of surviving trees grows as @xmath155 ( compared to @xmath156 in two dimensions ) and the branches of separate trees do not become heavily entangled with each other . on this basis , we conjecture that the essential physics of the stress - strain relation will not be qualitatively different in three dimensions .",
    "in particular , we expect a variation in the exponent @xmath50 with the scaled aspect ratio .",
    "we draw two general conclusions .",
    "first , it appears that the mechanism for the broadening of the vertical force distribution should be present in the full tensorial problem as well , and therefore should be re - examined as a possible explanation for the observation of smaller exponents than those derived from the mean - field argument .",
    "experiments measuring the dependence of the exponent @xmath50 on aspect ratio would be especially interesting .",
    "second , the success of the @xmath0-model  in predicting the distribution of single - grain forces in bead packs stands in need of explanation .",
    "the @xmath0-model   has already been criticized for its neglect of tensorial stresses @xcite .",
    "one may have expected it to provide a better description of the stresses in a scalar model of the type we have studied , but this is not borne out by our results .",
