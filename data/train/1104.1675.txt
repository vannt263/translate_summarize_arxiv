    "quantum entanglement is a physical resource with various applications to quantum information and communication processing .",
    "quantum teleportation uses maximal entanglement between two particles as a resource to transfer an unknown quantum state from one particle to another without sending the actual particle itself  @xcite .",
    "the non - local correlation of quantum entanglement also provides us with secure cryptographic keys  @xcite .",
    "whereas classical correlation can be freely shared among parties in multi - party systems , quantum entanglement is restricted in its shareability . if a pair of parties are maximally entangled in multipartite systems , they can not share entanglement  @xcite nor classical correlations  @xcite with the rest of the system , thus the term _ monogamy of entanglement _  ( moe )  @xcite .",
    "moe lies at the heart of many quantum information and communication protocols . in quantum cryptography , for example",
    ", moe is fundamentally important because it quantifies how much information an eavesdropper could potentially obtain about the secret key to be extracted ; the founding principle of quantum cryptographic schemes that an eavesdropper can not obtain any information without disturbance is guaranteed the law of quantum physics , namely moe rather than assumptions on the difficulty of computation .",
    "the first mathematical characterization of moe was established for three - qubit systems as an inequality in terms of concurrence  @xcite , which is referred as the coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) inequality  @xcite .",
    "the ckw inequality was generalized for multi - qubit systems  @xcite and for some cases of multi - qudit systems  @xcite , and dual monogamy inequalities were also proposed for multi - party quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "however , there exist quantum states in higher - dimensional systems violating ckw inequality  @xcite ; thus the ckw inequality in multi - qubit systems fails in its generalization into higher - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "moreover , characterizing moe as an inequality is not generally true for other entanglement measures such as _ entanglement of formation _  ( eof )  @xcite ; monogamy inequality in terms of eof is not valid even in multi - qubit systems .",
    "thus it is important to have a proper entanglement measures to characterize moe not only for the study of general moe in higher - dimensional quantum systems but in multi - qubit systems as well .",
    "the proof of the ckw inequality in multi - qubit systems  @xcite is based on the feasibility of analytic evaluation of concurrence for two - qubit mixed states .",
    "in fact , there are various possible definitions of bipartite entanglement measure using different entropy functions such as rnyi-@xmath5 and tsallis-@xmath6 entropies  @xcite . for selective ranges of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "these entanglement measures are tractable in two - qubit systems , and , moreover , monogamy inequality of multi - qubit entanglement is feasible in terms of these measures  @xcite .    here",
    "we establish a unification of monogamy inequalities in multi - qubit systems .",
    "using unified-@xmath0 entropy with real parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite , we define a class of bipartite entanglement measures namely _ unified-@xmath0 entanglement _ , and show a broad class of monogamy inequalities of multi - qubit systems in terms of unified-@xmath0 entanglement .",
    "our result shows that unified-@xmath0 entanglement contains concurrence , eof , rnyi-@xmath5 and tsallis-@xmath6 entanglement as special cases , showing their explicit relation with respect to a smooth function .",
    "furthermore , our result reduces to every known case of multi - qubit monogamy inequalities such as rnyi and tsallis monogamy  @xcite and the ckw inequality for selective choices of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
