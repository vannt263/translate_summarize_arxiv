    "motivated by applications in the field of quantum information processing  @xcite , quantum memory devices are being investigated in a variety of physical systems and with different techniques and protocols ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) . among the various criteria used to evaluate the performance of a quantum memory , are generally of interest its fidelity , its efficiency , its storage time and its multimode capacity  @xcite . for optical quantum memories ,",
    "in which an input light pulse is stored into a material system and subsequently retrieved , the efficiency can simply be defined as the ratio between the energies of the output and input pulses . for an important class of optical quantum memories based on electromagnetically",
    "induced transparency ( eit ) processes in atomic ensembles  @xcite , the efficiency crucially depends on the optical depth of the ensemble  @xcite . enclosing the atomic medium in an optical cavity allows for substantially increasing the effective optical depth experienced by the light and cavity eit protocols have been proposed to achieve high storage efficiencies  @xcite .    among the variety of atomic systems studied in connection with quantum memories , an ion coulomb crystals positioned in an optical cavity has been suggested as a good candidate to realize a high - performance quantum memory , potentially meeting the criteria mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "recently , this analysis has been backed up by a series of key experimental results .",
    "substantial effective optical depths can indeed be realized by strongly coupling large ion coulomb crystals to a cavity field and long coherence times can be achieved in such a system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , strong coupling to various spatial cavity modes has been demonstrated  @xcite , which is promising for multimode storage . finally , cavity eit has recently been observed with ion coulomb crystals using an _ all_-cavity geometry in which both the probe and control fields are coupled to the same cavity mode  @xcite .    in this specific cavity eit geometry , it has been observed , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , that the spatial transverse profile of the control field has a significant effect on the probe transmission / reflection lineshapes and dynamics .",
    "this is in contrast with more standard cavity eit configurations in which the control field is free - propagating and has typically a much larger extension than the probe field  @xcite .",
    "since the all - cavity geometry is one natural realization of the scheme presented in  @xcite , it is interesting to investigate its implications for the performance of such an ion coulomb crystal - based quantum memory . in this paper",
    ", we extend the existing theoretical models for cavity eit - based light storage and retrieval  @xcite to the all - cavity configuration and numerically investigate the effect of the transverse mode profile of the fields on the quantum memory efficiency .",
    "we find in particular that the optimal efficiency depends not only on the cooperativity parameter , but also on the radial extension of the crystal , as a result of the more complex spatial mode structure defined by the fields inside the atomic medium .",
    "using parameters taken from current experiments with ion coulomb crystals  @xcite , our simulations predict that similarly high - efficiencies ( @xmath0 ) should however be obtainable in the all - cavity configuration .",

    "the duration of the storage phase is then simply chosen such that the dynamics of the write and read phases occur in well - separated time windows .",
    "if the waist of the control field is much larger than the probe field , as in many eit experiments , one can neglect the transverse variations of the control field intensity over the section of the atomic ensemble that interacts with the probe field .",
    "following , e.g.  @xcite , one can define an effective number of atoms interacting with the probe field @xmath34 and collective operators for the ground state coherence and the optical dipole by @xmath35 equations  - can be straightforwardly rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the collectively enhanced coupling rate  @xcite .    in this collective mode picture ,",

    "similarly , one can define a readout efficiency by the ratio of the number of output photons and the number of atomic excitations before readout @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the start time of the read phase . in the adiabatic limit ,",

    "the spatial mapping of the probe field onto the ground state spin now depends on the control field transverse profile , in addition to that of the probe field . because of the intershell coupling during the mapping the radial extension of the ensemble now becomes a parameter which affects the memory efficiency in a non - trivial way .    in the following section we numerically solve these equations of motion for a fixed probe field pulse basing ourselves on the analytical control field pulse derived from the temporal optimization of sec .  [ sec : optimization_extended ] in absence of effects due to the control field transverse profile",
    "note that , because of the impossibility of defining analytically a spatial collective spin - mode during the write or read phase , and thereby of defining write or read efficiencies , this optimization is performed numerically using the total efficiency @xmath32 as a figure of merit .",
    "to solve the problem of optimizing the quantum memory efficiency in the conditions of the previous section we take for the physical storage medium an ion coulomb crystal , trapped and laser - cooled in a linear paul trap , with the optical cavity positioned along the trap axis , as in  @xcite .",
    "although single - component ion coulomb crystals ( i.e. consisting of only ion species ) have spheroidal shape and may therefore deviate from the cylindrical shell model ( unless they are sufficiently prolate ) , the inner component of a prolate two - species crystal can be assimilated to a good approximation to a uniform density cylinder  @xcite .",
