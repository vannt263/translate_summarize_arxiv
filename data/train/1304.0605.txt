    "blazars are a class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) comprised of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl  lac objects . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by non - thermal continuum spectra with a broad low - frequency component in the radio  uv or x - ray frequency range and a high - frequency component from x - rays to @xmath1-rays , and they often exhibit substantial variability across the electromagnetic spectrum , in extreme cases on time scales down to just a few minutes .",
    "blazars are sub - divided based on the location of their synchrotron peak : low - synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) blazars , consisting of fsrqs and low - frequency - peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) have @xmath5  hz ; intermediate - synchrotron - peaked ( isp ) blazars ( which are exclusively bl  lac objects and hence also termed ibls for intermediate bl lac objects ) have @xmath6  hz  @xmath7  hz ; high - synchrotron - peaked ( hsp ) blazars ( also exclusively bl lac objects , termed hbls for high - peaked bl lac objects ) have @xmath8  hz .",
    "the extreme inferred isotropic luminosities , combined with the rapid high - energy variability , provide convincing evidence that the high - energy emission from blazars originates in relativistic jets closely aligned with our line of sight ( for a review of those arguments , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the simplest ( and often sufficient ) assumption is that the emission is produced in an approximately spherical region , propagating along the jet with a speed @xmath9 , corresponding to a bulk lorentz factor @xmath10 .",
    "if the jet forms an angle @xmath11 with respect to our line of sight , this results in doppler boosting characterized by the doppler factor @xmath12   \\right)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the observed bolometric flux will be enhanced by a factor @xmath13 , while photon energies are blue - shifted by a factor @xmath14 , and variability time scales will be shortened by a factor @xmath15 ( for a review of relativistic effects in the jets of agn , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally accepted that the low - frequency ( radio through uv or x - ray ) emission from blazars is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "for the origin of the high - energy ( x - ray through @xmath1-ray ) emission , two fundamentally different approaches have been proposed , generally referred to as leptonic and hadronic models .    in leptonic models , the radiative output throughout the electromagnetic spectrum",
    "is assumed to be dominated by leptons ( electrons and possibly positrons ) , while any protons that are likely present in the outflow , are not accelerated to sufficiently high energies to contribute significantly to the radiative output .",
    "the high - energy emission is then most plausibly explained by compton scattering of low - energy photons by the same electrons producing the synchrotron emission at lower frequencies @xcite . in hadronic models , both primary electrons and protons",
    "are accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies , with protons exceeding the threshold for p@xmath1 photo - pion production on the soft photon field in the emission region .",
    "while the low - frequency emission is still dominated by synchrotron emission from primary electrons , the high - energy emission is dominated by proton synchrotron emission , @xmath16 decay photons , synchrotron and compton emission from secondary decay products of charged pions , and the output from pair cascades initiated by these high - energy emissions intrinsically absorbed by @xmath0 pair production @xcite . for a general overview of the features of both leptonic and hadronic blazar models , see @xcite .",
    "steady - state leptonic models have met with great success in modeling the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of all classes of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , including substantial samples of _ fermi_-detected blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "any short - term variability in the seds of the blazars under consideration , has therefore been averaged out over this integration time .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of this study , we will use time - independent models , which represent an appropriate time average of the rapidly variable broadband emission .",
    "the accurate evaluation of the radiative output of hadronic models is best achieved by monte - carlo simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the complicated energy dependence of the cross sections ( in particular , for p@xmath1 interactions ) involved .",

    "for the latter , we have developed a pre - processing routine which produces a spectrum file of the external radiation field in the agn rest frame .",

    "for the stationary model used in this work , our code finds an equilibrium between the relativistic particle injection mentioned above , radiative cooling , and escape . for this purpose , a critical lorentz factor @xmath32 is determined , for which the radiative cooling time scale equals the escape time scale , @xmath33 .",

    "condition ( 3 ) allows us to derive constraints on the size of the emission region from the observed variability time scale @xmath135 via @xmath136 ; ( 4 ) superluminal motion with a speed @xmath137 allows us to place a lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor of @xmath138 ; and ( 5 ) knowledge of the accretion - disk and blr luminosities further constrains the modeling of fsrqs in which these sources of external radiation fields are generally believed to be important .",
    "we found that the following objects fulfilled our criteria : the fsrqs 3c  273 , 3c  279 , 3c  454.3 , pks  1510 - 089 , pks  0420 - 01 , and pks  0528 + 134 ; the lbls bl  lacertae , ao  0235 + 164 , s5  0716 + 714 , and oj  287 ; and the ibls w  comae and 3c  66a .",
    "sed data for these objects are obtained from @xcite , and table [ constraints ] lists observational data that are used to further constrain our models .",
    "our fitting procedure is a `` fit - by - eye '' method , starting with plausible values for the parameters that are not directly constrained by observations .",
    "the unconstrained parameters are then adjusted to obtain an acceptable representation of the sed .",
    "simpler models with fewer parameters , such as a single - zone , static ssc model , allow for a detailed @xmath139 minimization technique ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , given the substantial number of adjustable parameters , such a fitting method is infeasible for the models considered here . while we are confident that our best - fit parameters are in the correct ball - park range for these objects , the lack of a rigorous @xmath139 minimization strategy prevents us from determining errors on the fit parameters .",
    "therefore , while we will proceed to a global assessment of parameter values among different classes of blazars , we will refrain from any quantitative statements in this respect .",
    "in the course of the fitting , we strive to achieve acceptable fits with parameters close to equipartition between the dominant particle species ( electrons in the leptonic model , protons in the hadronic model ) and the magnetic field .",
    "this is motivated by two arguments : ( 1 ) if the relativistic jets of agn are powered by rotational energy from the central black hole @xcite , the jets are expected to be initially poynting - flux dominated , and the energy carried in electromagnetic fields needs to be transferred to relativistic particles in order to produce the observed high - energy emission .",
    "this energy conversion is expected to cease as approximate equipartition between the magnetic field and relativistic particles is reached , so that the jets are not expected to become matter dominated in the central few parsecs of the agn , where the high - energy emission in blazars is believed to be produced @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) if magnetic pressure plays an essential role in collimating agn jets out to kpc scales , the particle pressure can not largely dominate over the magnetic pressure in the inner few parsecs of the agn .",
    "for these reasons , we prefer model parameters with magnetic fields dominating the pressure and energy density in the emission region over particle - dominated scenarios .    for all objects",
    ", we produced one leptonic and one hadronic model fit to the contemporaneous sed . in the case of 3c  66a ,",
    "the catalog value of the redshift of @xmath140 is highly questionable .",
    "the recent analyses of @xcite and @xcite place the object at a likely redshift of @xmath141  0.3 , while @xcite provide a lower limit on the redshift of @xmath142 , based on uv absorption features by intervening intergalactic medium . in our modeling",
    ", we assume a fiducial redshift of @xmath43 for 3c  66a . while , of course , the parameter values slightly change when using a slightly higher redshift ( say , @xmath143 to be consistent with @xcite ) , the overall conclusions from the modeling remain unaffected .",
    "all our model seds are corrected for @xmath0 absorption by the extragalactic background light using the model of @xcite .",
    "figures [ leptonic_fsrq ]  [ leptonic_ibl ] show the seds and our leptonic model fits for the 12 blazars we selected for this study .",
    "the fit parameters used and a few quantities derived from those parameters , are listed in table [ fitpars ] . in general , satisfactory fits to most blazar seds with parameters close to ( within an order of magnitude of ) equipartition can be achieved with the leptonic model described above .    in agreement with many previous studies",
    ", we find that fsrqs require a dominant contribution from external - compton ( on the direct accretion disk and the blr emission ) in order to provide acceptable sed fits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in our model fits , we are able to produce the spectral breaks observed in the fermi - lat spectra of many blazars , with a superposition of two different @xmath1-ray emission components , as previously proposed for the case of 3c454.3 by @xcite .",
    "typical minimum variability time scales from light - travel time arguments are of the order of 1  2 days , consistent with the day - scale variability seen in most fermi - detected fsrqs .",
    "as argued previously , e.g. by @xcite and @xcite for the case of bl  lacertae , also lbls are represented with more plausible parameters when including an ec component using a low - luminosity accretion disk and blr , compared to a pure ssc model . in the case of s5  0716 + 714 , where no observationally motivated estimates of the luminosity of the accretion disk or the blr could be found ,",
    "we have assumed the existence of a dust torus with a very low infrared luminosity , consistent with the absence of any direct observational evidence for it .",
    "our models allow for variability on time scales of a few hours for the lbls modelled here . while the seds of bl lacertae , s5  0716 + 714 and oj  287 are well represented by a leptonic ssc+ec model , our model has problems representing the very hard @xmath1-ray spectrum of ao  0235 + 164 above a few gev as our model @xmath1-ray spectra are truncated by klein - nishina effects .    in blazars",
    "in which we find that a substantial contribution from ec on direct accretion - disk emission is relevant , we find a best - fit distance of the @xmath1-ray emission region from the central black hole in the range @xmath144  pc .",
    "an important contribution from ec on blr emission would imply a characteristic distance of @xmath145  pc , while a much larger distance would be consistent with situations in which ec on infrared emission ( from warm dust ) dominates the @xmath1-ray production . as described in ",
    "[ lepton ] , the external radiation fields from the blr and/or warm dust are modelled as isotropic in the agn rest frame so that for such fits , the distance to the black hole is not necessary input parameter for our model .    while bl  lac objects detected at @xmath146  gev @xmath1-rays by ground - based atmospheric cherenkov telescopes have often been found to be well represented by pure ssc models , the careful analysis of the simultaneous seds of the veritas - detected ibls w  comae and 3c  66a @xcite revealed that also in these two cases , a pure ssc fit would require rather extreme parameters with magnetic fields far below equipartition",
    "this situation could be remedied allowing for a contribution from external compton to the @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "these findings are confirmed in this study .",
    "however , the unusual , apparent upward curvature of the _ fermi_-lat spectrum of 3c  66a and w  comae can not be satisfactorily represented with our model , irrespective of the dominant target photon field for external compton scattering .",
    "we find that the two ibls in our sample require systematically higher doppler factors than the lbls and fsrqs .",
    "also , as expected , bl  lac objects are characterized by less powerful jets ( i.e. , lower @xmath147 ) than fsrqs , and the two ibls require harder electron spectra than the lbls and fsrqs .",
    "we do not find a systematic difference in magnetic - field values between bl  lacs and fsrqs , neither are the characteristic electron energies ( represented by @xmath148 ) systematically different between the two classes of objects .",
    "if charge neutrality in blazar jets is provided by cold protons ( rather than positrons ) , our fits indicate that the kinetic energy carried by the jets should be dominated by protons .",
    "overall , we find that the seds of bl lac objects , both ibls ( fig .  [ hadronic_ibl ] ) and lbls ( fig .",
    "[ hadronic_lbl ] ) , can be well represented with our model .",
    "the typically low ratio of @xmath1-ray to x - ray flux and the hard @xmath1-ray spectra observed in bl lac objects ( as compared to fsrqs ) is naturally obtained by photo - pion induced cascade emission with substantial contributions from proton - synchrotron radiation . in some cases , an additional contribution from the leptonic ssc emission aids in producing the observed x - ray flux .",
    "however , even though the addition of photopion induced cascade emission to a proton synchrotron component is , in principle , able to reproduce concave @xmath1-ray spectra , the steep upturn of the fermi - lat spectrum of 3c  66a and w  comae at gev energies is still not well represented also by this model , and may indicate the need for an additional emission component ( possibly from muon / pion synchrotron radiation , with consequences for the values of the fit parameters ) .",
    "we note that the required power in relativistic protons , @xmath149 , is very large , in the range @xmath150 ",
    "@xmath3erg s@xmath4 , which is significantly higher than the observed radiative luminosities of these objects .",
    "fits within the framework of the hadronic model to the seds of the fsrqs in our sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ hadronic_fsrq ] .",
    "although the hadronic model appears to satisfactorally fit most of the snap - shot seds , the typically observed spectral break at gev energies seems problematic in the cases of 3c  273 and 3c  279 .    also here , the @xmath1-ray component is dominated by proton synchrotron radiation , with some contribution from proton initiated pair cascade emission above @xmath151  gev .",
    "the too steep decline of the proton synchrotron emission at a few gev may indicate too steep a decline of the radiating proton distribution in the cutoff region ( here considered a hard - cutoff ) , and hence possibly an impact of the acceleration mechanism in this region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed hard x - ray to soft @xmath1-ray spectral shapes can be fitted if proton synchrotron emission is the dominant radiation channel ( in order not to over - predict the x - ray flux due to reprocessing of uhe @xmath1-ray emission in cascades ) .",
    "this indicates the presence of high magnetic field strengths in the emission region .",
    "the hadronic fsrq fits also require extreme jet powers , in some cases exceeding @xmath3erg s@xmath4 in relativistic protons .    in summary , we find that the hadronic model presented here provides satisfactory fits to most of the bright blazar seds of our sample .",
    "however , the declining ( in @xmath152 ) broken power - law shape observed in many _",
    "fermi_-lat spectra of fsrqs causes problems for adequate fits in two cases within the limits of this model .",
    "fits to most objects have been achieved with magnetic fields in the range @xmath153  30  g. all fits required proton acceleration to energies of @xmath154  ev .",
    "nearly all model fits used a strong cascade component to aid modeling the high energy gev data .",
    "this leads to the requirement of a disproportionately large proton luminosity as compared to the magnetic field luminosity . as a consequence in all hadronic model fit parameter sets presented here the total jet power",
    "is dominated by protons .",
    "alternatively , hadronic models that take charged @xmath155 synchrotron radiation into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could lower the strength of the pair casade component , thereby reducing the proton contribution to the jet power at the expense of magnetic field power . in order to produce the observed ( electron - synchrotron ) ir  uv emission",
    ", the model requires lower characteristic electron energies for fsrqs ( @xmath156 ) than for bl  lac objects ( @xmath157 ) , along with harder electron spectra in bl  lac objects .",
    "all our fits were achieved with characteristic doppler factors of @xmath158  30 .",
    "in this paper , we have described the development of new implementations of stationary , single - zone leptonic and hadronic models .",
    "our leptonic model allows for arbitrary external photon sources , and solves self - consistently for an equilibrium between relativistic particle acceleration ( injection ) , radiative cooling , and escape .",
    "our hadronic model is based on the @xcite templates for the final products of photo - pion production , and uses a new , semi - analytical method for calculating the output from ultra - high - energy induced pair cascades .",
    "we have used both leptonic and hadronic models to fit the contemporaneous seds of 12 _ fermi_-lat deteced blazars with good multiwavelength coverage and additional observational constraints on model parameters .",
    "we find that the seds of all types of blazars can be well represented with leptonic models with parameters close to equipartition between the magnetic field and relativistic electrons in the emission region .",
    "however , our leptonic model is unable to provide a good fit to the hard _ fermi_-lat spectrum of ao  0135 + 164 .",
    "the problem lies in the mismatch between the very steep synchrotron ( ir  optical  uv ) continuum , as opposed to the very hard @xmath1-ray spectrum , and klein - nishina effects at the highest @xmath1-ray energies . we confirm that even intermediate bl  lac objects are more appropriately fit including an external radiation field as source for compton scattering to produce the observed @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "fsrqs are characterized by systematically more powerful jets , but lower bulk lorentz factor and softer electron spectra than bl  lac objects . if charge neutrality in blazar jets is provided by cold protons ( rather then relativistic positrons ) ,",
    "our fits indicate that those protons are dominating the kinetic power carried by the jets by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the hadronic model presented here has difficulty describing the gev - break in the seds of two fsrqs , but provides appropriate fits for all other blazars in our sample .",
