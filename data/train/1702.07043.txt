    "electrical energy is an inseparable part of modern life and , especially in developing countries , efficient electricity generation has become increasingly important and even of strategic value @xcite .",
    "many power plants in the world use fossil fuels ( coal , oil , and natural gas ) to produce electricity .",
    "however , use of fossil fuels causes severe environmental damages and affects human health , and resource limitation can lead up to an energy crisis in the following decades @xcite .",
    "moreover , transmitting electricity produced in large power stations to remote consumers requires installation and maintenance of expensive overhead power lines , which may not be a viable solution for many regions economically or due to inaccessible geographical location @xcite .",
    "an alternative is using renewable energy , such as the water , wind , biofuel or solar energy ; and the environmental challenges presented by the use of fossil fuels has dramatically increased the necessity of using renewable energy as one of the sustainable and clean natural energy resources @xcite . among them",
    ", water is a cheap and clean source of power generation and plays an important role for a sustainable future @xcite .",
    "hydropower has been utilized for more than a century and is the most common and most efficient source of renewable electricity generation @xcite .",
    "additionally , it can have a positive impact on country development and increase the quality of life @xcite . in 2014 ,",
    "4000 twh of electricity was produced by hydropower and it accounted for 16.4% of world electricity , and 73.2% of total renewable electricity production .",
    "this amount is expected to increase to 4500 twh by 2020 @xcite .",
    "generally , hydropower is produced by turbines installed in large dams ; however , the high initial cost of installation and power transmission , as well as the environmental challenges associated with dams , makes local power generation an attractive and efficient option , especially in rural , remote and mountainous areas @xcite .",
    "small turbines can be installed on rivers , fish farms , and water purification facilities to provide enough electricity for homes , farms and small plantations in remote areas @xcite . however , the turbine used for this purpose should have unique characteristics , including an affordable price , easy and low cost of maintenance , and a high efficiency under varying load conditions that is present in many local water sources .",
    "these features are all present in a cross - flow turbine .    in a cross - flow turbine",
    ", water enters the rotor tangentially , passes through it transversely and exits it radially , thereby transmitting the majority of its kinetic energy to the rotor .",
    "the specific speed of the cross - flow turbine is greater than the impulse pelton turbine but lower than the mixed - flow francis turbine .",
    "a cross - flow turbine can achieve an efficiency value of up to 86% , which is slightly less than other types of hydraulic turbines ( pelton , francis , and kaplan ) @xcite , and is suitable for applications where water head is between 2.5 and 200 meters and water volume flow rate is between 0.025 and 13 cumecs @xcite .",
    "cross - flow turbine is generally used in micro and small power plants , with output powers ranging from 20 kw to approximately 5 mw @xcite .",
    "components of a typical cross - flow turbine are shown in .",
    "in addition to having a simple structure and design , which results in a low manufacturing cost , the cross - flow turbine is particularly of interest because it has a flat efficiency curve @xcite . when needed , the turbine can be built as a multi - cell turbine with a 1:2 division .",
    "this enables the turbine to handle low - flow conditions and operate at optimum efficiency for any water flow from 1/6 to 1/1 of the design flow rate .",
    "in addition , a cross - flow turbine does not require any special maintenance or treatment and is self - cleaning : water that passes through the turbine clears away any object in its path and prevents rotor clogging .    in the following two sections ,",
    "we give a brief review of theoretical equations proposed for designing the turbine and previous studies .",
    "the ambiguous , inconsistent and sometimes contradictory nature of many of these results is discussed in order to demonstrate the need for a universal design framework .",
    "the two main parts of a cross - flow turbine are nozzle and rotor .",
    "the rotor is made up of two parallel discs that are joined to each other at the rim using several curved blades .",
    "the nozzle , which has a rectangular cross - sectional area , guides the water jet towards the rotor , which then strikes the blades on the rim , flows inside the channels between the blades for the first time , passes through the empty space in the middle of the rotor and flows through the mid - blade channels for a second time , exiting the rotor almost radially @xcite .",
    "using the reynolds transport theorem , mockmore and merryfield showed that the highest value of efficiency that can be achieved theoretically is equal to @xmath0 and it is achieved if @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath3 denotes turbine efficiency , which is the ratio of output power @xmath4 to input power @xmath5 , and should not be confused with turbine s hydraulic efficiency , which is defined as , @xmath6 @xmath7 is the amount of water s energy ( total pressure ) leaving the turbine .",
    "hydraulic efficiency merely accounts for the amount of energy loss in the turbine , and ideally has a value of 1 .    using ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the blade inlet angle is calculated by using : @xmath8 the blade exit angle @xmath9 is selected similarly , and its value must be equal to 90 degrees to avoid loss of efficiency @xcite .    the nozzle height can be determined by using : @xmath10 furthermore , mockmore and merryfield showed that , accounting for the centrifugal force of the rotor , the optimal rotor inner - to - outer diameter ratio ( from here on simply called `` diameter ratio '' ) can be calculated by using @xcite : @xmath11\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_1}\\right ) - \\tan^2(\\beta_1 ) = 0 ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the rotor length by , @xmath12    to reduce manufacturing costs , turbine blades are assumed to be circular arcs having a constant thickness .",
    "the blade radius @xmath13 is calculated by using : @xmath14 similarly , for the blade central angle @xmath15 : @xmath16",
    "australian engineer a. g. m. michell , hungarian inventor donat banki , and german entrepreneur fritz ossberger are generally credited as the first people to develop a cross - flow turbine .",
    "michell patented his design in 1903 , while banki further developed it in west germany , and the turbine became known as the banki or banki - michell turbine .",
    "banki suggested expressions for maximum turbine efficiency , diameter ratio and energy transfer at each stage and developed methods for designing rotor blades @xcite . meanwhile , ossberger collaborated with michell and improved his design , patenting the `` free - jet turbine '' in 1922 .",
    "after years of refinement , ossberger obtained an imperial patent for the `` cross - flow turbine '' and started production in 1933 @xcite .",
    "mockmore and merryfield laid the foundation of research on cross - flow turbine by translating banki s transcripts into english .",
    "they also built an experimental model of this turbine and investigated the effect of rotational speed on turbine efficiency under various load conditions , verifying that the maximum efficiency occurred near the nominal speed calculated theoretically @xcite .",
    "since then , many researchers have performed experimental studies on cross - flow turbine .",
    "khosrowpanah et al .",
    "tried to optimize the number of blades , diameter ratio , and admission angle @xcite .",
    "fiuzat et al .",
    "experimented on the turbine to determine the contribution of each stage to the output power @xcite .",
    "aziz et al . performed several experiments to identify the favorable values of attack angle , diameter ratio , and the number of blades @xcite .",
    "olgun conducted experiments to investigate the effect of diameter ratio and internal guide tubes in rotor on the performance of cross - flow turbine @xcite .",
    "kaunda et al . performed several experimental studies to investigate the effect of water head , rotational speed and guide vane opening on the performance of cross - flow turbine , and later used a numerical approach as well @xcite .",
    "since the early days of cfd , many researchers have used it solely or in conjunction with experiments to analyze and optimize cross - flow turbine performance .",
    "choi et al . used cfd extensively to analyze the effect of various parameters , as well as nozzle shape , draft tube and air layer on the performance of cross - flow turbine @xcite .",
    "de andrade et al . investigated internal flow characteristics in a cross - flow turbine numerically @xcite , while sammartano et al .",
    "used a transient model to analyze the behavior of a cross - flow turbine , investigate the effect of rotor shaft on turbine performance and optimize various parameters such as rotational speed , number of blades and diameter ratio , validating the results experimentally later @xcite .",
    "yassen used cfd to optimize various parameters , including the number of blades , diameter ratio , attack angle , admission angle , and blade and nozzle profiles @xcite , while adhikari et al .",
    "studied the occurrence of cavitation in cross - flow turbine using cfd @xcite .",
    "summarizes results of previous studies on the cross - flow turbine and contains values of turbine parameters used or optimized in each study .",
    "a - mark indicates the information has not been mentioned in the respective research . also , theo represents a theoretical , con a conceptual , num a numerical , and exp an experimental study .",
    "[ table1 ]    almost every study reviewed in has investigated the performance of a low - head micro cross - flow turbine .",
    "therefore , rotor diameter mostly has a value that falls between 150 and 350 millimeters .",
    "moreover , suggests that results obtained in these studies are partly inconsistent and occasionally even contradictory .",
    "most studies agree that an optimal attack angle is between 12 and 20 degrees , with 16 being the favorable value . only a few have concluded that an attack angle greater than 20 degrees leads to a higher efficiency ( @xcite ) ; however , it seems that in these studies the value of hydraulic efficiency is mistakenly reported instead of turbine efficiency , leading to the erroneous conclusion that 22 degrees is the optimal value for attack angle . additionally , according to the optimal value of diameter ratio is between 0.65 and 0.69 .",
    "inconsistencies become notable when considering data on the number of blades and admission angle .",
    "while data in suggests that the optimal value of admission angle is between 80 and 120 degrees , some researchers reported 90 degrees as the optimal value while others favored 120 degrees .",
    "furthermore , it is seen that data in for the number of blades is evenly distributed between 15 and 35 blades without any relation to site - specific values such as water head or volume flow rate .",
    "therefore , no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the optimal value of the number of blades based on .",
    "although these studies provide a good insight into the effect of each single parameter on the efficiency of the turbine , only a few of them provide a limited framework for designing a new turbine .",
    "none of these studies provide details about the system - level design phase , which includes defining product architecture and determining key parameters such as rotor diameter , while only a few ( such as @xcite ) propose limited methodologies for the detail design phase .    in order to facilitate the design process in the future ,",
    "a new design framework is proposed in this article that encompasses both the system - level design and detail design phases .",
    "this new methodology relies on theoretical expressions and experimental data for the system - level design phase and on cfd simulations for the detail design phase , where an appropriate cfd model is discussed in detail and validated by experimental data .",
    "furthermore , in order to demonstrate its strength , the proposed methodology is used to design and optimize the performance of a new cross - flow turbine , which not only achieves a high value of efficiency , but also maintains that efficiency under a wide range of load conditions .",
    "design and development of a new product normally comprises these five phases : concept development , system - level design , detail design , testing and refinement , and production ramp - up @xcite . to install a new hydraulic turbine , in the concept development phase it is essential to collect data on water head and volume flow rate of a potential installation site for several months ( usually one year ) .",
    "this data should be analyzed to determine whether a hydraulic turbine can be installed , and if so , what kind of turbine(s ) should be used .",
    "also , the project should be examined from a financial standpoint to determine whether the proposed turbine(s ) are affordable and whether the installation is a wise investment .",
    "the next two phases , system - level design and detail design , explore determining the product architecture , parameter value selection , and geometry optimization @xcite .      in the following sections ,",
    "first we establish a design framework for the system - level design phase , which primarily discusses the process of selecting key turbine parameters , and then validate it using data from working turbines .",
    "the first stage in the system - level design phase is defining product architecture and identifying its components .",
    "cross - flow turbine typically consists of a nozzle and a rotor , and water is discharged from the nozzle onto the rotor .",
    "this simple design has evolved over the years and has taken various forms .",
    "the architecture that we use consists of four major components : nozzle , rotor , housing and guide vane .",
    "the rotor should be installed inside the housing at the nozzle exit within a small clearance ( 1 to 2 millimeters ) , which ensures that efficiency losses due to air entrainment are kept at a minimum .",
    "also , a curved guide vane should be used inside the nozzle to guide and regulate water flow , as shown in . moreover",
    ", a low - head turbine can feature a draft tube to increase the net water head and an air vent to regulate the pressure inside the housing .",
    "the second stage is determining turbine parameter values , including rotor diameter and length , diameter ratio , rotational speed , attack angle , blade inlet and exit angles , admission angle , and the number of blades .",
    "note that values assigned to some of these parameters are preliminary and subject to change in the detail design phase .    in order to facilitate the process",
    ", we utilize the theoretical relations presented in to determine parameter dependency .",
    "specifically , if values of rotor diameter , attack , admission and blade exit angle , and the number of blades - which we call key turbine parameters - are known , rotor length is obtained from and rotational speed is calculated by using ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "furthermore , blade inlet angle is computed from and diameter ratio is obtained from . finally , nozzle height and blade specifications are determined by using , and , respectively .",
    "therefore , it suffices to determine the value of key turbine parameters , and other parameter values will be determined accordingly .    as discussed in",
    ", the value of blade exit angle must be 90 degrees to avoid loss of efficiency .",
    "based on the discussion in we use the universally accepted value of 16 degrees for attack angle , as well as preliminary values of 120 degrees for admission angle and 32 for the number of blades , although they will be optimized in the detail design phase .",
    "we utilize a parameter similar to the specific speed of turbomachinery to determine the value of rotor diameter .",
    "this parameter has been computed for numerous hydraulic turbines ( including cross - flow turbine ) experimentally and is used to determine the optimal range of rotational speed of a turbine based on water head and volume flow rate @xcite . for a cross - flow turbine , this information leads to the value of rotor diameter by using ( @xmath2 ) .    presents the dimensionless specific speed of turbomachinery , but this definition is rarely used and the definition given in that uses metric units is more common @xcite .",
    "@xmath17^{\\frac{5}{4}}}. \\label{equation10 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by slightly changing the definition of @xmath18 , a new parameter is obtained which is denoted by @xmath19 , and is defined as , @xmath20^{\\frac{3}{4}}}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the main advantage of @xmath19 over the traditional @xmath18 is that instead of using the output power to calculate the parameter , which is usually unknown during the system - level design phase , only site - specific values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are used .    the value of @xmath19 has been calculated for various types of turbines experimentally , and the results are plotted against water head to obtain regions of optimal performance for different types of turbines @xcite . this diagram is shown in .",
    "it is observed from that the value of @xmath19 for a cross - flow turbine is slightly greater than its value for a pelton turbine , but almost the same as that for a francis turbine .",
    "the main difference between these turbines is in the operating range of water head ; cross - flow turbines are mostly used for low - head applications , whereas francis and pelton turbines are mainly used in medium- and high - head sites , respectively .",
    "the process described here for the system - level design phase can be summarized in the flow - chart in . as explained earlier",
    ", this process receives water head and volume flow rate values as inputs and leads to preliminary values of key turbine parameters , as well as turbine s architecture .      in this phase , use of previous studies to determine the values of key turbine parameters - except rotor diameter - guarantees that they are in the optimal range . the method used to determine rotor diameter",
    "is based on experimental data as well , but further evaluation can point out any possible flaws .",
    "the best way of doing so is by using publicly available data from several ossberger@xmath23 turbines , which is tabulated in .",
    "[ table2 ]    in order to validate the proposed methodology , the value of @xmath19 for each turbine is calculated using data from .",
    "then , these values are plotted against the optimal region proposed in .",
    "the result is presented in .    from a total of 18 turbines ,",
    "14 of them fall inside the designated region in .",
    "the four remaining turbines are those installed at goodyear lake and zahlen power plants . turbines of the goodyear lake power plant were installed during the 1970s and have an efficiency of approximately 75 percent which is far less than the optimal value of 85 percent @xcite , so they should be located outside of the optimal region .",
    "furthermore , note that all of these four turbines have very low rotational speeds ( which is the only non - site - specific variable affecting the value of @xmath19 ) , and lowering that speed any further may require a bigger gearbox or a more expensive generator which may impact the overall efficiency and cost of the power plant .",
    "this can explain why a higher rotational speed is preferred instead .",
    "overall , the conclusion that can be drawn from the argument above is that unless there are concerns about the impact of other components of the system on the overall efficiency of the power plant , the value of @xmath19 for a cross - flow turbine should be in the designated region in for the turbine to operate at optimal conditions .",
    "the detail design phase encompasses a broad range of activities and much of it is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "our focus is on the first level of this phase for a cross - flow turbine , which is specifying its interior geometry .",
    "this level can be broken down into three steps .",
    "the first step is nozzle design for nominal operating conditions , the second step is optimizing turbine parameter values for nominal operating conditions , and the final step is analyzing turbine s performance under various load conditions and making necessary modifications in order to achieve a constant value of efficiency for a wide range of water head and volume flow rate .",
    "this approach is further illustrated in .",
    "the first step in the new methodology is nozzle design for nominal operating conditions .",
    "the goal of this step is to achieve a uniform velocity and attack angle profile at the nozzle exit .",
    "this can be accomplished by modifying nozzle and guide vane geometries and analyzing flow conditions and velocity and attack angle profiles at the nozzle exit .",
    "the second step is parameter optimization for nominal operating conditions .",
    "the goal of this step is to increase turbine s efficiency by optimizing the value of several turbine parameters .",
    "therefore , this step is broken down into sub - steps , and in each sub - step one parameter is optimized .",
    "then , the optimal value of that parameter is used in future optimizations . in our methodology ,",
    "six parameters have been selected for optimization because we believe that they have the greatest effect on turbine s efficiency .",
    "however , some may prefer to skip optimizing one or more of these parameters to reduce development time and cost .",
    "the third and final step is design modification . in this step ,",
    "turbine s performance is analyzed under varying water head or volume flow rate conditions and necessary modifications - both to turbine geometry and parameter values - are made in order to achieve an approximately constant efficiency for a wide range of load conditions , which is the hallmark of the cross - flow turbine .",
    "optionally , the effects of a draft tube and an air vent on turbine s performance can be studied in this step .",
    "reveals that in the second step , each parameter is optimized separately instead of optimizing them all at once .",
    "the reason is that if the latter approach was adopted with a numerical algorithm to optimize all of the parameters , like the genetic algorithm , the effect of each parameter on turbine s performance could not be understood . alternatively , if an experimental method was implemented , and assuming that at least three values were considered for each parameter , at least @xmath24 experimental setups would be required which if not impossible , is both economically unjustifiable and time - consuming .",
    "also shows that nozzle design and parameter value optimization are done separately because it helps reduce the time needed for each of these steps .",
    "initially , this methodology is highly iterative and several cases must be analyzed ; however , the results are scalable .",
    "once the geometry has been determined , it can be scaled with respect to rotor diameter to obtain the geometry of a larger or smaller turbine .",
    "this is true for many parameters as well : once it has been determined that @xmath25 is the optimal value of a parameter , @xmath25 can be used for every cross - flow turbine regardless of its size .",
    "exceptions to this rule are diameter ratio and number of blades , which are dependent to each other by a parameter called solidity @xcite , and their values slightly depend on water head .",
    "therefore , they should be optimized on a case by case basis .",
    "this methodology , which many researchers have partially used in their studies , can be implemented both experimentally and numerically .",
    "a numerical approach is preferred , however , since an experimental setup is both prolonged and expensive .",
    "nevertheless , in a numerical approach it is essential to use a correct cfd model and to verify and validate that model using experimental data .      in this research , we used solidworks@xmath26 to design cad models , ansys@xmath26 meshing to mesh the geometry and ansys@xmath26 cfx to perform cfd simulations .",
    "however , any other native or commercially available cad or cae program may be used , as long as the cfd model is validated by experimental results .",
    "the first step of performing a numerical simulation is designing the geometry .",
    "the focus of this step is on the interior design of the turbine , so it suffices to prepare a simple model of turbine s interior while discarding external features .",
    "moreover , it is a good practice to use a parametric design for easy geometry scaling . since cfx does not allow two - dimensional cfd simulations , a slab with a small width ( 1 or 2 millimeters ) is prepared and used instead , with symmetry boundary condition assigned to the sides @xcite .",
    "next , the geometry must be meshed , which is highly important since mesh size and quality directly impacts solution time and the accuracy of results .",
    "unstructured mesh is favored over structured meshing since the fluid flow - especially that of air - is largely undetermined .",
    "the majority of the meshing consists of tetrahedral elements , each having a size that is equal to the width of the slab @xcite .",
    "however , near - wall regions have been meshed using meshing s built - in pre - meshing inflation algorithm with multiple ( more than 20 ) layers of prismatic elements @xcite .",
    "the first layer has a height of only 10 micrometers and layer heights grow geometrically by a factor of 1.05 .",
    "this resolution is necessary for error reduction when using the shear stress transport ( sst ) turbulence model @xcite .",
    "a sample meshing is shown in .",
    "after geometry meshing is complete , a cfd model should be defined to simulate fluid flow . in our models",
    "we assume that the flow condition is steady and that buoyancy forces are negligible due to the small elevation difference in the turbine in comparison to the water head . furthermore , since no noticeable temperature change occurs during turbine s operation , we assume that heat transfer between the turbine and its surroundings is negligible as well .",
    "we used the shear stress transport ( sst ) turbulence model with automatic wall function to model the flow @xcite .",
    "the sst model gives highly accurate predictions of the onset and the amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradients @xcite , which is extremely useful when studying the effect of blade profile on turbine efficiency .",
    "for the first step , a single - phase model with water as the only phase is used to simulate flow in the nozzle , and the convergence target is set to 1.0e-08 to obtain accurate results .    as stated before , symmetry boundary condition",
    "is assigned to the sides , and static pressure at the outlet is set to 1 atm .",
    "mass flow rate boundary condition is assigned to the inlet because it gives the most robust configuration and is not sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "the inlet total pressure is an implicit result of the simulation @xcite .",
    "a smooth no - slip wall boundary condition is assigned to the rest of the surfaces , and initial conditions are determined automatically by the software .",
    "these boundary conditions are illustrated in .",
    "the cfd model used for the second step is more complex than before because it models the rotation of the rotor , and is very similar to the model used by kaunda et al .",
    "@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the rotor is divided into two separate domains , one is rotating and consists of the area surrounding the blades , while the other is stationary and comprises both the inside of the rotor as well as the outside space in the housing .",
    "we used a multiphase model utilizing both water and air as continuous fluids for the stationary domain .",
    "additionally , since a well - defined interface exists between water and air , we utilized a homogeneous turbulence model @xcite .",
    "surface tension between the two phases is also modeled with air as the primary fluid .",
    "the model used for the rotary domain is the same , except that the domain revolves around the rotor s axis .    to obtain accurate results , a physical timescale equal to @xmath27",
    "is used , where @xmath28 is in rad / s @xcite , and the convergence target is set to 1.0e-06 .",
    "additionally , we utilized advanced options like rhie - chow pressure - velocity coupling to achieve a smooth pressure field @xcite .    in the second step , it is assumed that water enters the rotor with the desired velocity and angle so that we can analyze the effect of selected parameters on the turbine s performance .",
    "therefore , components of water velocity in cylindrical coordinates are defined at the rotor inlet , water s volume fraction is set to 1 , and that of air is set to 0 . at the outlet , an opening boundary condition is used with the static pressure set to 1 atm , and values of volume fraction and turbulence are assumed to have a zero gradient at the outlet .",
    "same as before , symmetry boundary condition is assigned to the sides , while a smooth no - slip wall boundary condition is given to the housing and rotor blades .",
    "a rotating wall boundary condition is also assigned to the rotor shaft , having the same speed as the rotor @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions are illustrated in .",
    "the frozen rotor frame change model is utilized to model the interface between the stationary and rotating domains .",
    "this model treats the flow from one domain to the next by changing the frame of reference while maintaining the relative position of the components and has the advantages of being robust , using fewer computer resources than other frame change models , and being well suited for high blade counts .",
    "however , using this model may result in inadequate prediction of physics for local flow values , and the results are slightly sensitive to the relative position of the stationary and rotating domains @xcite .",
    "the cfd model used for the third step is the same as the previous step , except that now the body is divided into three domains , one stationary domain for the nozzle , one rotating domain for the rotor , and another stationary domain for the housing .",
    "the boundary conditions and interfaces are the same as well , except at the nozzle inlet . in order to obtain accurate results ,",
    "first a simulation is performed using the mass flow rate boundary condition , then the boundary condition is changed to total pressure and the previous result is used as the initial condition of the new simulation .",
    "these boundary conditions are illustrated in .",
    "several methods have been suggested for validation of a cfd model , including iterative convergence examination , consistency examination , spacial ( grid ) convergence examination , temporal convergence examination and model uncertainty examination .",
    "however , the best method is still the comparison of cfd results to experimental data , because experimental data is the observation of the `` real world '' in some controlled manner . a good agreement between these results increases confidence that the physical model and the code represent the `` real world '' for this class of simulation @xcite .",
    "in order to validate the proposed cfd model , we used it to simulate the operation of a prototype cross - flow turbine designed and developed by durali system design and operation ( dsda ) , which was tested under various load conditions experimentally to examine its efficiency . in the end ,",
    "simulation results are compared to experimental data to check their agreement and model validity .",
    "[ [ section4.2.3.1 ] ] experimental setup + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    experimental tests were carried out at the testing facility of water research institute of iran ( wri ) located in tehran which is 1300 meters above the sea level .",
    "the facility consists of a water pumping system and a test stand on which the prototype cross - flow turbine is coupled to a synchronous generator .",
    "the experimental setup is similar to the one used by sammartano et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experimental setup operates in a closed loop mode and is composed of an open tank reservoir , a suction pipe , four centrifugal pumps ( to simulate various flow conditions ) and a discharge pipe that is connected to the test stand .",
    "the rotor shaft is coupled to the generator shaft using pulleys and v - belts , and the electrical characteristics of the generated power are measured using a power analyzer unit .",
    "the generator has four poles and a speed of 1500 rpm when used with 50 hz electricity .",
    "several other instruments are used to measure different variables , and a summary of their specifications is available in .",

    "@xcite or sammartano et al .",
    "@xcite who consider a value of 5% absolute error acceptable ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the relatively large value of uncertainty in experimental results is caused by two factors : first , turbine efficiency variation due to the changing relative position of the rotor and the nozzle and second , the large relative uncertainty of the flow meter .    shows the operating prototype turbine , and shows the distribution of total pressure inside the turbine that was obtained from the simulation results .",
    "it is evident from that water flow follows the correct path inside the turbine ; however , water exits the turbine in a different manner than the way observed in .",

    "gives a closer look at velocity vectors entering the rotor and shows that the main cause of power loss is the flow separation that occurs at the tip of several blades which prevents water from transferring its energy to the rotor .",
    "also , a portion of the water in the front and back of the turbine scarcely enters the rotor because of its centrifugal force , which results in the loss of power .",
    "the final step is to validate the methodology and show that it can be successfully used to design a high - efficiency cross - flow turbine . to that end",
    ", we used the new methodology to design a turbine with a much higher efficiency which will replace the prototype turbine developed by dsda .",
    "we designed the turbine for a nominal water head of 10 m and volume flow rate of 200 l / s .",
    "this nominal operating condition is one of the most prevalent hydro potentials in iran .",
    "preliminary values of key turbine parameters , except rotor diameter , are selected according to the process described in . to select the value of rotor diameter by using , for a 10 m water head the minimum and maximum possible values of @xmath19 are 28 and 56 , respectively , hence by using , the minimum and maximum possible values of rotational speed are obtained to be 352 and 704 rpm , respectively .",

    "are 300 and 200 mm ; however , the 300 mm diameter rotor is preferred because it results in less centrifugal force ( which causes efficiency loss ) and reduces the possibility of cavitation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this choice implies the use of a gearbox with a higher reduction ratio which may impact overall efficiency .",
    "after the value of rotor diameter is determined , equations that were introduced in are utilized to calculate the values of the remaining turbine parameters .",

    "starting from the initial geometry , water flow through the nozzle is simulated and velocity and attack angle profiles at the nozzle exit are plotted .",

    ". however , reveals a considerable difference in the attack angle profiles .",
    "the reason for this difference is that attack angle is much more dependent on the nozzle geometry than velocity , and several parts of the nozzle geometry play a crucial role in determining it . in the final nozzle ,",
    "the curve below the guide vane and the curve at the end of the nozzle are linear in terms of polar angle ( which is explained in detail by sammartano et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    as can be seen from , the final nozzle has smoother curves , which prevents an abrupt increase in water velocity and reduces flow separation at the bends above and below the guide vane .",
    "furthermore , shows a notch at the middle of the profile .",
    "this notch is located at the tip of the guide vane and has a lower velocity than other regions because of the fully developed boundary layers on both sides of the guide vane that merge at that point .",
    "calculations show that the values of nozzle loss coefficient for the initial and final nozzles are 0.972 and 0.977 , respectively . using the latter value and , and assuming that the value of rotor loss coefficient is equal to 0.94 , the maximum possible efficiency for this design is 85.6% .",

    "<S> an extensive amount of research has been conducted on hydraulic cross - flow turbine over the past decades in order to improve its performance , but in several cases results are contradictory and little has been mentioned about the design process . therefore , there is no universal , coherent methodology for designing a cross - flow turbine given the water head and volume flow rate . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we address this issue by introducing a design framework , both for the system - level design and detail design phases , which relies on theoretical expressions , numerical simulations , and experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this methodology is utilized to design a new cross - flow turbine and optimize its performance by investigating the effect of several parameters , such as admission angle , blade profile , and diameter ratio , on turbine s efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the turbine that is developed using this method achieves an efficiency of 82% and maintains this high value of efficiency for water volume flow rates as low as 16% of the nominal flow rate and water head variations of up to 30% .    </S>",
