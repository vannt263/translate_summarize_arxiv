    "star formation occurs regularly in the simulation after redshift 25 , four ( six ) ionizing photons are needed per sustained hydrogen ionization .",
    "as the most massive halo becomes larger than @xmath0@xmath159 in the simulations without sne , regions become trapped and ionizing radiation only escapes into the igm in small solid angles .",
    "hence the number of photons per effective ionization increases to 15 ( 50 ) . in simb - sn ,",
    "stellar radiation from induced star formation have an escape fraction of nearly unity , which occur four times in the calculation .",
    "this allows the igm to remain ionized at a volume fraction 3 times higher than without sne .",
    "similarly , the ionizing photon to ionization ratio also stays elevated at 10:1 instead of decreasing in the calculations with star formation only .",
    "our simulations that include star formation and h@xmath10  formation capture the entire evolution of the clumping factor that is used in semi - analytic models to calculate the effective enhancement of recombinations in the igm .",

    "we calculated the jeans filtering mass with the volume - averaged temperature only in fully and partially ionized regions , which yields a better estimate than the temperature averaged over both ionized and neutral regions .",
