    "the threshold theorem of quantum error correction promises the accurate implementation of arbitrary size quantum algorithms if the underlying physical errors are below certain values .",
    "the error thresholds depend strongly on the specific quantum error correcting code , how errors are detected and fixed @xcite , and what errors are assumed @xcite .",
    "most codes have been designed to fix random pauli errors and error correction procedures can be simulated efficiently using the stabilizer formalism @xcite . a broader class of errors including clifford operations @xcite and pauli measurements @xcite",
    "can also be included in this formalism . for a single qubit",
    ", this extended error set has been shown to yield improved approximations of realistic error models including amplitude damping @xcite .    here",
    "we examine whether these improved approximations also lead to more accurate threshold estimates .",
    "specifically , we calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code @xcite for two non - stabilizer errors , amplitude damping and a depolarization channel along a magic - state axis , and compare the exact solution to approximations based on pauli errors or clifford and pauli measurement errors .",
    "the steane code has been well studied theoretically @xcite and a logically encoded state has been recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite . the code is small enough to allow for exact simulation similar to recent work on distance-3 surface codes , which compared a realistic error model corresponding to t@xmath0 ( amplitude damping ) and t@xmath1 ( dephasing ) processes and an approximate pauli error model based on twirling @xcite .",
    "in addition to the pseudothreshold , we are interested in two other qualities of the approximation , the accuracy and the honesty .",
    "the accuracy is a measure of how close is the state generated by the approximate evolution to the state generated by the exact evolution .",
    "we describe an approximation as honest if the final state after the approximate evolution is further from the initial state than the final state after the exact evolution . in other words ,",
    "an approximation is honest if it upper - bounds the error of the exact evolution . as pointed out by puzzuoli _",
    "the composition of honest approximations is not necessarily honest @xcite .",
    "this implies that an approximation that is honest at the 1-qubit physical level might lead to a dishonest representation of the overall error produced on the system .",
    "if our goal is to employ our approximate channels to infer the performance of error - correcting strategies under realistic non - stabilizer noise , then we need to be cautious and be sure that they compose in an honest fashion .",
    "we provide numerical evidence that , in the context of an error - correcting circuit , an honest approximation at the physical level remains honest at the logical level .",
    "furthermore , we show that , for the error models studied , physically dishonest approximations based on the pauli channel might lead to approximations at the logical level that are both approximately honest and very accurate , in agreement with similar results obtained by geller and zhou @xcite .",
    "this suggests that it might not be necessary for the approximations to be honest at the physical level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : channels ] , we describe the target realistic error channels and our method for generating approximate channels @xcite . in section [ sec : hon_and_acc ]",
    ", we review the important concepts of honesty and accuracy of an approximate channel . in section [ sec : threshold_method ] we explain our procedure for calculating the pseudothreshold . in section [ sec : results ] , we present our results before concluding in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we review all the error channels introduced in @xcite . we start with the stabilizer expansions to the pauli channel ( pc ) that are used as models to approximate realistic non - stabilizer error channels .",
    "next we discuss two important cases of these error channels that lie outside the stabilizer formalism .",
    "finally we review two different constraints under which the approximations are performed .",
    "all the error channels introduced in this section will be expressed in the operator - sum representation .    throughout the paper we use @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 to represent the pauli matrices with associated eigenvectors",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 respectively .      one of the main ideas introduced in @xcite was that the pc can be greatly expanded without becoming non - stabilizer .",
    "we do this by adding kraus operators that correspond to either clifford operations or pauli measurements followed by conditional pauli operations . for the 1-qubit case ,",
    "the clifford channel ( cc ) , which corresponds to the first expansion , is composed of the 24 operators that maintain the symmetry of the chiral clifford octahedron @xcite .",
    "another expansion to the pc can be obtained by introducing pairs of operators that effectively produce a measurement in a pauli basis followed by a conditional pauli operation , such that all states are mapped to the same state .",
    "we refer to these pairs of operators as measurement - induced translations . for each pauli state ,",
    "@xmath8 , these operations can be represented by the following pairs : @xmath9    the addition of these measurement - induced translations to the pc gives rise to the pauli + measurements channel ( pmc ) , while their addition to the cc produces the clifford + measurements channel ( cmc ) .",
    "as in @xcite , we use the efficiently simulable channels to approximate realistic non - stabilizer channels . in particular",
    ", we focus on the amplitude damping channel ( adc ) and the polarization along an axis in the x - y plane of the bloch sphere ( pol@xmath10c ) , shown on equations [ eq : adc ] and [ eq : polc ] , respectively :    @xmath11    @xmath12 \\end{cases } \\label{eq : polc}\\ ] ]      the free parameters in the pc and its expansions correspond to the probabilities associated with the kraus operators .",
    "previously , we have obtained stabilizer approximations to the realistic non - stabilizer channels by minimizing the hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite over the parameter space of the models . as we do not want to underestimate the deleterious effect of the target channel on quantum information ( i.e. we want our approximation to be `` honest '' @xcite ) , we perform the minimizations such that the approximate channels constitute an upper bound on the error induced on the system .",
    "mathematically , this condition can be enforced in a variety of ways , by employing different fidelity or distance measures . from the constraints that we have studied",
    ", the most lenient one corresponds to the average fidelity constraint , in which we enforce the following condition : @xmath13 the average fidelity between a unitary transformation @xmath14 and a quantum channel @xmath15 is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimension of the hilbert space and @xmath18 are these kraus operators of the error channel @xmath15 .",
    "on all the approximations that we have performed , the average fidelity constraint has always given the same results as if no constraint had been applied .",
    "on the other hand , the most stringent constraint corresponds to the worst trace distance one , in which we enforce that for every initial pure state its trace distance to the resulting state after the target transformation is not greater than its trace distance to the resulting state after the model approximation : @xmath19 where the trace distance is calculated using the following expression : @xmath20    this worst trace distance constraint results in approximate channels that are honest , in the sense that the deleterious effect of the target error channel on any pure quantum state will never be underestimated , as pointed out by magesan @xmath21 @xcite and puzzuoli @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we could think of an even tighter constraint in which we enforce this condition on every initial state , pure or mixed . however , if the target and the model transformations have different fixed points , this condition is impossible to satisfy .",
    "we compare results for both constraints and label them `` a '' ( average fidelity constraint ) and `` w '' ( worst trace distance constraint ) .",
    "for each approximate channel , we study two properties : honesty and accuracy .",
    "an approximate channel is honest if it does not underestimate the detrimental effect of the target error channel .",
    "the accuracy of an approximate channel refers to how closely it can mimic the effect of the target channel on an initial state .",
    "more explicitly , if a target error channel @xmath22 maps a pure state @xmath23 to @xmath24 and an approximate channel @xmath25 maps the same state to @xmath26 , then @xmath25 is honest if @xmath27 for every pure state in the initial physical or logical space .",
    "the accuracy is measured by the average trace distance between the resulting states : @xmath28    notice that for both properties , our measure of choice is the trace distance .",
    "a good approximate channel will be honest ( or as least dishonest as possible ) and as accurate as possible , not only at the physical level , but also at the various logical levels .",
    "we distinguish 4 different scenarios to compare honesty and accuracy : ( a ) the physical ( 1-qubit ) level , ( b ) the uncorrected logical level , ( c ) the logical level with perfect ec , and ( d ) the logical level with faulty ec , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : the_levels ] .    for each target non - clifford error channel ,",
    "we study two kinds of approximations : ( a ) the pauli channels ( pc ) , which employ only 1-qubit pauli operators , and ( b ) the expanded channels or clifford+measurements channels ( cmc ) , which include all the 1-qubit clifford operators and the measurement - induced translations @xcite . in turn , each kind of approximation is performed with the average fidelity constraint ( `` a '' ) and the worst trace distance constraint ( `` w '' ) , resulting in four approximate channels . notice that the unconstrained pc is equivalent to the pauli twirled approximation @xcite , the channel obtained by removing the off - diagonal elements from the target channel s process matrix in the pauli basis @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the completely isotropic pauli channel or depolarizing channel ( dc ) , the most common error model used when calculating thresholds . in this paper",
    "we are comparing single qubit error channels and we only use the single qubit depolarizing channel .",
    "this channel is a version of the pc a where the coefficients corresponding to each pauli matrix are forced to have the same value .",
    "this error model serves as a reference .",
    "the approximations are summarized in table [ table : channels_summary ] .",
    ".summary of the various target and approximate channels . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : summarysteanepolxy ]    the results for the adc and the pol@xmath29c are summarized in tables [ table : summarysteaneadc ] and [ table : summarysteanepolxy ] , respectively . for the adc ,",
    "the pseudo - thresholds are expressed in terms of the damping strength , @xmath30 , while for the pol@xmath29c , they are expressed in terms of the noise strength , @xmath31 . in both cases , the standard deviation of the pseudo - thresholds",
    "is included inside parentheses .",
    "notice that the code - capacity pseudo - thresholds are about 3 orders of magnitude higher than the circuit - based ones .",
    "the latter ones are on the range expected for the steane code @xcite .",
    "although the code - capacity pseudo - thresholds are unrealistically high , they show similar trends with respect to their circuit - based counterparts .    in general , the target non - clifford channels and their cmc approximations result in high standard deviations of the pseudo - thresholds around its average values .",
    "this implies that for these channels the pseudo - thresholds are much more dependent on the initial state than for the pcs .",
    "it is interesting that the pauli channels always result in pseudo - thresholds that are lower than the real ones .",
    "this trend has also been observed by tomita and svore on the surface code @xcite and suggests that anistropic pauli channel approximations to realistic noise models are pessimistic",
    ". the cmc w approximations also result in lower pseudothresholds .",
    "this is in contrast to the isotropic pauli channel approximation ( dc ) that yields optimistic pseudothresholds .",
    "the cmcs give more accurate pseudo - threshold estimates than the pcs , as can be seen by comparing their rms values . although we might expect the `` a '' channels to result in better approximations than the `` w '' channels , in general this is not the case .",
    "the most important variation is between the cmcs and the pcs . in general",
    ", however , the `` w '' channels result in lower pseudo - thresholds than the `` a '' channels , which implies that honest approximations at the physical level generate conservative estimates of the threshold .",
    "finally , we notice that the circuit - based pseudothresholds are quite comparable yielding pseudothresholds within a factor of two for all of the error models . the dc model representing isotropic depolarizing noise yields the least accurate results and the highest thresholds .    in the previous section , we noticed that the pc a , one of the simplest approximations at the physical level , and one that is not even honest , results in very accurate and practically honest approximations at the corrected logical levels . in the context of our level-1 pseudo - threshold estimation",
    ", this result suggests that we can take a different strategy . instead of using the approximate channel at both the physical and logical level to calculate the pseudo - threshold",
    ", we can use the target channel at the physical level and the pc a approximation at the logical level .",
    "more generally , we can simulate the realistic noise model in an exact way whenever it is feasible , and in the encoded cases just use the pc a. if we take this approach , we obtain more accurate state by state pseudo - thresholds for the circuit - based case as seen in tables [ table : summarysteaneadc ] and [ table : summarysteanepolxy ] .",
    "we have studied the feasibility of using approximate error channels at the physical level to simulate the performance of qec protocols under the influence of non - stabilizer errors .",
    "we have selected the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code as a model qec protocol and have calculated the honesty and accuracy of the pauli and expanded approximations to realistic non - stabilizer errors .",
    "we have also computed the code s pseudothreshold under the different error models .    similarly to results recently obtained for distance-3 surface codes @xcite , the pc approximations result in lower pseudothreshold values than the realistic error channels .",
    "in contrast , the isotropic dc approximation yields higher pseudothresholds than the target channels in the circuit - based model . since most thresholds in the literature use two - qubit and one - qubit depolarizing channels",
    ", we expect that realistic error models with equivalent fidelity will have slightly lower pseudothresholds in practice .",
    "we have also found that physically honest approximations compose well : they result in honest approximations at the logical level .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , for both realistic noise models analyzed , the dishonesty of the pc a gets greatly reduced at the corrected logical levels and its accuracy becomes extremely high .",
    "this suggests that , if our goal is to estimate thresholds , then the best protocol is to model the error as realistically as possible at the physical level and use the pc a at the logical level .    as explained by puzzuoli _",
    "@xcite , single qubit errors can be separated into errors that deform the bloch sphere and errors that preserve the bloch sphere .",
    "both target error models analyzed in our work deform the bloch sphere where the pc a yields effectively honest approximations at the logical level for small errors .",
    "_ found that when the errors are unitary , the pc a generally results in a poor approximation . in future work , we will compute the level-1 pseudothreshold for the steane and other codes under unitary errors , to determine if pauli and expanded approximations still result in pessimistic pseudothreshold estimates .",
