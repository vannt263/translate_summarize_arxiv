    "<S> many problems in geometry , topology and dynamical systems on surfaces lead to the study of closed surfaces endowed with a flat metric containing several cone - type singularities , that are called _ </S>",
    "<S> flat structures _ or _ translation surfaces_. + the first construction in the theory is that of a flat structure which is obtained from billiard on a rational polygon by _ unfolding _ it to a collection of polygons with gluings . that is , from a polygon @xmath0 , we develop a polygonal system @xmath1 , with sides identified by translation , to get a surface @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to associate a closed , orientable surface to the billiard table which has the same geodesics ( the billiard trajectories ) . </S>",
    "<S> rational billiard determines a flat structure ; however most of the flat structures are not obtained from billiards . + </S>",
    "<S> over the course of studying billiard dynamics , several questions were raised . </S>",
    "<S> one of the questions was , which surfaces satisfy the following property ( which is called </S>",
    "<S> _ veech s dichotomy _ ) : any direction is either _ completely periodic _ or _ uniquely ergodic_. + in an important paper @xcite veech gave a sufficient condition for this dichotomy . </S>",
    "<S> he showed that if the stabilizer of a translation surface is a lattice in @xmath3 , then the surface satisfies veech s dichotomy . </S>",
    "<S> later , smillie and weiss @xcite proved that this condition is not necessary . </S>",
    "<S> they constructed a translation surface which satisfies veech s dichotomy but is not a lattice surface . </S>",
    "<S> their construction was based on previous work of hubert and schmidt @xcite , by taking a branched cover over a lattice surface , where the branch locus is a single _ non - periodic connection point_. + in this work we tried to answer the following question : is there a flat structure obtained from a billiard table that satisfies veech s dichotomy , but its veech group is not a lattice ? in theorem [ main ] we prove that in the entire list of possible candidates for such a construction , an example does not exist . </S>"
