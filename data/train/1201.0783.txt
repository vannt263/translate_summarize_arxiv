    "understanding the evolution of galaxies and large scale structure remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics .",
    "many ambitious galaxy surveys have been carried out to address this problem , but limited time on large telescopes results in a classic problem : sky coverage , depth , and spectral resolution ",
    "choose two .",
    "for example , the very - wide - area sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provides a wealth of spectral information for galaxies over a cosmologically significant volume , but its modest depth limits the sdss to the relatively local , ` modern ' universe .",
    "conversely , the hubble ultra - deep field photometric survey probes deep into cosmic time  to the epoch of reionization , but only over a tiny volume whose small population of galaxies leads to large uncertainties on their physical properties . while the union of such surveys has begun to paint a coherent picture of galaxy growth , significant patches of blank canvas limit our ability to fully describe how environmental processes , the infall of gas that fuels star formation , galaxy mergers and acquisitions , and feedback , all shape the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time .",
    "the carnegie - spitzer - imacs survey ( csi ) has been designed to address one of the most dramatic and least understood features of galaxy evolution  the remarkably rapid decline in cosmic star formation since @xmath1 .",
    "it is during this extended epoch of galaxy maturation that galaxy groups and clusters have also emerged as a conspicuous feature of the landscape .",
    "the csi survey is uniquely able to link together the evolution of individual galaxies with these features of large - scale structure growth .    in our ambitious spectrophotometric redshift survey of distant galaxies , we strike a balance between the aforementioned three factors : ( 1 ) high completeness to moderate redshift ( @xmath9 ) , ( 2 ) spectral resolution intermediate between conventional photometric and spectroscopic surveys ( combining the efficiency of imaging surveys with a spectral resolution high enough to resolve large - scale structure and prominent emission - lines ) ; and ( 3 ) an unprecedented area of 15 deg@xmath2 for a @xmath10 survey .",
    "this gives the csi survey a volume comparable to the sdss , with a selection method that efficiently traces stellar mass over 2/3 the age of the universe ( @xmath11 )  spanning the critical redshift range where cosmic star formation precipitously drops , and groups and clusters become prominent .",
    "as the redshift survey with the largest unbiased volume at @xmath12 , csi will allow us to comprehensively address the interplay between environment , galaxy mass buildup , and star formation at these redshifts .    in this , the first paper of the csi survey , we describe the design of the project , with particular focus on the flux limits of the selection , the data processing and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting with its attendant determination of redshifts and redshift errors .",
    "we apply our methodologies to the first batch of data in 5 degs@xmath2 of the swire xmm - lss field , and provide an overview of some basic properties of galaxies over the past 9 gyr , with an emphasis on the gains made by selecting galaxies by stellar mass instead of by their rest - frame uv light .",
    "any effective probe of galaxy assembly must sample a wide range of masses in order to trace evolutionary connections between large and small systems .",
    "the build - up of massive red sequence galaxies may be driven by mergers with sub-@xmath13 systems , so it is essential to trace evolution to masses below @xmath13 to mitigate against the differential growth of the high- and low - mass populations .",
    "this trade - off between depth and area noted above has led to a dichotomy in redshift surveys .",
    "very deep programs , such as the gemini deep survey ( gdds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the galaxy mass assembly ultra - deep spectroscopic survey ( gmass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could not cover enough volume to robustly sample the evolution of the high mass population at @xmath14 , while other surveys that have traded depth for area do not reach below @xmath13 with high fidelity .",
    "an old stellar population at @xmath12 with a stellar mass of @xmath15 corresponds to roughly @xmath6 mag and @xmath16 mag in the optical , as shown in figure [ fig : masslimits](top left ) .",
    "the extreme optical faintness of such galaxies results in many of them being missed in optically - selected surveys despite their relatively high masses .",
    "for example , the selection limits for deep2 @xcite and primus @xcite are shown in this figure by the blue and green dashed lines , respectively . at @xmath17 these programs _ required _ galaxies to be extremely massive or have their optical light dominated by young stellar populations in order to be fall within the survey selection .",
    "at best it can be difficult to trace the evolution of the most massive galaxies with such surveys . at worst , if not properly accounted for , color - dependent selection effects introduce biases and systematic effects .",
    "extremely deep optical limits can be taken as one valid approach to ameliorating this problem , with the side effect of an overwhelming number of low - mass star - forming dwarfs dominating one s source catalog .      the integrated light of all but the youngest stellar populations are dominated by light from the stellar giant branch , cool stars whose light output peaks in the near - ir .",
    "it has long been recognized ( e.g. , wright  1994 ) that this results in a @xmath18 m `` bump ''  a peak in bolometric luminosity  for galaxies with a wide range of star formation histories .",
    "indeed , as shown clearly in ( for example ) figure 1 of @xcite , this feature is nearly unchanging in @xcite models of stellar populations with mean ages 100 myr @xmath1910 gyr . put in other terms , the near - ir mass - to - light ratio , m / l@xmath20 changes slowly for all but the youngest stellar populations .",
    "the csi survey exploits the wide field and sensitivity of the _ spitzer space telescope _ with the _ infrared array camera _ ( _ irac _ ) to take advantage of this property of the integrated near - ir light from stellar populations in @xmath21 galaxies .",
    "combined with the insensitivity to internal and galactic extinction , selection at @xmath0 m closely mirrors selection by stellar mass .",
    "figure 1 ( top left ) directly compares the evolution of @xmath0 m magnitude with the optical @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands : the csi selection wavelength has a dependence on redshift that is much shallower than surveys selected in the optical .",
    "what slope remains for the csi selection function is the unavoidable _ k - correction _ : over the redshift range @xmath24 , the center of the @xmath0 m _ irac _ band corresponds to restframe wavelengths of @xmath25 , that is , straddling the @xmath18 m `` bump '' of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , but shifting through this feature as the redshift changes .",
    "even so , massive galaxies exhibit a much flatter trend of observed magnitudes with redshift in the ir than in the optical , and this weaker dependence on galaxy mass afforded by @xmath0m - selection of the sample is a key feature of the csi survey .",
    "our goal has been to make a spectrophotometric survey to characterize the galaxy populations and environments to @xmath26 , unbiased at all redshifts down to a stellar mass of @xmath27 . as can be read from figure 1",
    ", this mass limit corresponds at @xmath12 to @xmath28 mag or @xmath29 mag , with equivalent limits of @xmath30 mag and @xmath31 mag to reach this mass limit at @xmath32 .",
    "our current spectroscopic reduction and analysis , described below , is reaching an effective photometric limit of @xmath30 mag ( the dashed orange line ) .",
    "figure 1 ( bottom left ) plots the limiting mass as a function of redshift for csi ( solid orange ) and other redshift surveys .",
    "the depth of csi in stellar mass is substantially less sensitive to redshift compared to the others due to the _ irac _",
    "@xmath0 m selection , varying by a factor @xmath33 over @xmath34 , compared to @xmath35dex over the same redshift range for optically - selected surveys .",
    "the result is that csi samples nearly uniformly by stellar mass for the full , large volume of the survey , and to a lookback time of 9 gyr .",
    "this critical point is illustrated in figure 1 ( bottom right ) , plotting the depth in stellar mass against the volume probed with complete , unbiased samples .",
    "deep2 , shown in violet ( the line colors are the same as in the bottom left ) , is limited in both area and mass depth .",
    "primus s 9 degs@xmath2 is limited in depth , and thus only probes an unbiased volume comparable to our first 5 degs@xmath2 .",
    "when csi reaches its goal of 15 degs@xmath2 , the survey will cover an unbiased volume equal to the sdss with similar depth in stellar mass .",
    "the large areas available from legacy spitzer _ irac _ surveys  both wide _ and _ deep , and the freedom from foreground and internal extinction at this wavelength , allows the construction of uniformly deep , homogeneous photometric samples for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "csi reaches factors of 2 - 6 deeper than deep2 in mass , over an area ultimately 8 times wider , and redshifts sufficiently accurate to characterize environments by directly identifying groups and clusters .",
    "with such data we aim to make the first group catalog at @xmath12 that is statistically comparable to sdss , and thus enable the first detailed environmental characterizations of galaxies at a time when the universe was less than half its current age .    in this first paper",
    ", we describe the details of our data reduction and redshift fitting , redshifts for the first 37,000 galaxies in 5.3 degs@xmath2 of the swire - xmm field ( figure [ fig : xmmfield ] ) , and an initial characterization of the general galaxy populations in our stellar mass - limited sample .",
    "a project of this type and scope requires attention to detail and care in the processing of a broad range of data from different sources . in this section",
    "we describe the imaging data and reductions that underpin the broadband flux measurements for the sample , both for the ultimate goal of fitting seds , but also for defining the selection criteria and incompleteness functions .",
    "unless otherwise specified , all object detection was performed using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the swire legacy survey @xcite observed several large fields with _",
    "irac _ to a depth suitable for our survey .",
    "three of these fields are accessible from southern telescopes , providing up to 23.8 deg@xmath2 of coverage at @xmath0 m .",
    "basic properties of the three fields are given in table [ tab : fields ] .",
    "of these fields , @xmath36 deg@xmath37 have supplemental optical imaging that is publicly available . of the 9.1 degs@xmath2 of _ irac _ imaging in the xmm - lss field ,",
    "6.9 degs@xmath2 is covered by the cfht legacy survey w1 @xmath38 imaging . in this section",
    "we discuss our analysis of the swire xmm - lss _ irac _ data , our reprocessing of the cfhtlsw1 @xmath38 imaging and subsequent photometry of the @xmath0 m catalog , as well as our observations at @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the field using newfirm @xcite on the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the swire legacy survey was a program undertaken to trace galaxies by stellar mass back to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the _ irac _ images of the xmm - lss field were obtained from the archive at ipac .",
    "the reductions and processing of these data were described by @xcite . in order to minimize contamination of the object catalog by artifacts around stars , we configured sextractor so as to ignore elliptical regions around bright stars . a ` mexican hat '",
    "convolution kernel was used for object detection , resulting in 585,159 objects in the @xmath0 m catalog of the xmm - lss field .",
    "fluxes were measured in a manner described by @xcite . down to our selection limit of @xmath42 mag",
    "the @xmath0 m catalog contained 266,621 objects .",

    "the `` wide '' survey focused on several astrophysical questions , with the w1 field providing almost 7 deg@xmath37 of overlapping @xmath38 coverage in the swire xmm - lss field .",
    "unfortunately , the processed images and catalogs available at terapix were not entirely suitable for our purposes , owing to uncertain astrometry and improper defringing of the @xmath23 and @xmath43 data .",
    "therefore , we obtained the complete set of calibrated frames from the cfht archive and processed the data using the following additional steps .",
    "first , we constructed new fringe frames in @xmath23 and @xmath43 by medianing scaled exposures obtained within a single night .",
    "these were then rescaled and subtracted from the individual exposures .",
    "some bright objects did bias these medians when the number of exposures was small ( i.e. @xmath44 ) , leaving faint traces in the resulting fringe frames . in general , however , the greater sky uniformity after subtraction of these new fringe frames improved the depth of our resulting catalogs by @xmath45 to @xmath46 mag compared to the on - line catalogs .",
    "we constructed sky frames as well for the @xmath47 , and @xmath22 bands using a similar methodology , though not restricting the construction to data collected within single nights .",
    "new astrometric solutions were derived for each exposure using the _ irac _ catalog as a set of deep astrometric standards .",
    "cubic solutions for each chip were derived with a typical rms scatter of 015 .",
    "for those regions of the megacam images that did not overlap the swire data , we supplemented the catalog with the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , in order to prevent the solutions from diverging at the edges of the _ irac _ field .",
    "using these new astrometric solutions , and the photometric solutions from the headers of the individual frames , we constructed cosmic - ray - cleaned image stacks with 0185 pixels , 30 arcmin on a side and evenly spaced .",
    "these smaller images were more easily managed than the larger image formats provided by terapix , which allowed us to distribute the image analysis and photometry tasks over multiple processors .",
    "the zeropoints were checked by comparing the photometry of moderately bright objects with the data in the catalogs from terapix and we found systematic offsets less than @xmath48 mag in every case .",
    "object catalogs were generated using sextractor , and these were matched to the _ irac _ catalog with a tolerance of 15 arcsec , with the goal of using the optical image characteristics to aid in star / galaxy separation , and to determine which _",
    "irac_-selected objects have centroids with optical centers falling far from the defined slit positions .",
    "newfirm @xcite is a wide - field ( @xmath49 ) near - ir camera deployed by noao at the mayall 4 m at kitt peak from 2007 to early 2010 . during the fall semesters we imaged the xmm - lss field in @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "typical exposure times were 70 min / pixel in @xmath39 and 32 min / pixel in @xmath40 .",
    "the seeing ranged between @xmath50 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "the data were processed using a fully automated , custom pipeline , written as a prototype for a wide - field imager being deployed at magellan .",
    "the basic steps in the reduction were : ( 1 ) subtraction of the dark current ; ( 2 ) correction for nonlinearity ; ( 3 ) division by a flat - field ; ( 4 ) masking of known bad pixels ; ( 5 ) construction of first - pass sky frames ; ( 6 ) derivation of image shifts , in arcsec , on the sky ; ( 7 ) stacking of the first - pass sky - subtracted frames ; ( 8) generation of a deep object catalog ; ( 9 ) construction of object and persistence masks for second - pass sky estimation ; ( 10 ) temporary interpolation over objects , persistence , and bad pixels for each frame ; ( 11 ) constructing bivariate wavelet transforms of these masked frames ; ( 12 ) fitting the time variation of the wavelet transforms of the sky using shorter frequencies for larger spatial scales ; ( 13 ) reconstruction of model sky frames by inverting the temporally smoothed wavelet transforms ; ( 14 ) subtraction of the model sky frames ; ( 15 ) re - derivation of image shifts , in arcsec , on the sky ; ( 16 ) final stacking of the sky - subtracted frames , including the generation of sigma and exposure maps ; ( 17 ) identification of objects in the 2mass point source catalog , restricted by 2mass psc quality flags ; ( 18 ) application of rotation , translation , and scale to the camera distortion based on the 2mass objects ; and ( 19 ) calculation of image zero - points using the 2mass objects .    using the zeropoints of each image",
    ", we constructed image mosaics @xmath51 on a side centered at the locations of our @xmath38 mosaics , but with 04 pixels .",
    "magnitudes in @xmath52 were derived using aperture photometry within a range of circular apertures for the entire swire catalog . because the seeing varied with wavelength and pointing , we convolved the @xmath43-band image stacks with gaussians to simulate the effects of poorer seeing in the @xmath53 data .",
    "the offsets in magnitude from the degraded @xmath43 images were applied as psf - corrections to the @xmath53 aperture magnitudes . while the details of the psf and potential blending are critical for small apertures and for modeling the profiles of the objects , our choice of fitting the seds to much larger - aperture ( @xmath54 ) magnitudes allows us to utilize a simple and economical approach to the psf corrections .",
    "this choice was especially important given the enormous size of the object catalog , while reducing the systematic errors in matching the aperture magnitudes to the _ irac _",

    "the eight layers are made from thin prisms of s - fpl51 and n - kzfs2 , to make a stack of glass 150 mm thick .",
    "this prism has a resolution with a mild dependence on wavelength ( see figure [ fig : resolution ] ) compared to the first prism deployed in imacs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : udpphoto],width=288 ]          between 2008 and 2009 the swire xmm field was targeted in 31 multislit mask exposures with the _ imacs _ f/2 camera configuration and the low dispersion prism ( ldp ) designed by s. burles for the primus redshift survey @xcite . in 2010",
    "we observed 29 swire xmm masks using an innovative eight - layer disperser called the uniform dispersion prism ( udp , see figure [ fig : udpphoto ] ) .",
    "although both of these dispersers produce spectra with median resolutions of @xmath56 , the dispersion curve of the udp is much flatter , providing significantly higher resolution out to @xmath57 m than the ldp at the expense of marginally lower resolution in the blue ( figure [ fig : resolution ] ) .",
    "previous work by the pi on a similar program had obtained adequate @xmath58 ratios with exposure times of 3 hours down to @xmath59 mag using less sensitive site detectors ( patel et al . 2009ab , 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "significantly more sensitive e2v detectors were installed in imacs , thanks to support from the nsf s tsip program ( see dressler  2011 ) ; these ccds boosted the throughput of the instrument by factors of 2 - 3 in the far red .",
    "we observed with these detectors using the nod and shuffle mode of imacs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and accumulated exposure times of 2h per galaxy for more than 90% of the sample , using individual integrations with durations of 30 min ( 15 min per position ) .",
    "typical slit lengths were 5 arcsec .",
    "the positions of the slit masks are shown in figure [ fig : xmmfield ] .",
    "spectrophotometric standards were obtained during most observing runs , with a consistency of 5% from run - to - run .",
    "helium calibration lamps illuminating the deployable flat - field screen were taken approximately every hour ( i.e. , every other science exposure ) . in this section",
    "we describe the basic steps involved in reducing the multislit prism data using the custom pipeline that had been written for the earlier cluster programs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two critical aspects of the reduction of low - dispersion prism data involve mapping wavelengths on the detector , and transposing between sky coordinates of objects and ccd coordinates .",
    "too few calibration lamp lines can be used to define the solution for a given slitlet , so we derive global wavelength mappings over an entire ccd using all of the slitlets simultaneously .",
    "thus , lines in a single spectrum that may be corrupted by bad columns or pixels will not affect the solution for that slitlet , as the @xmath60 helium lines over a ccd frame constrain the fit .",
    "the following are the basic , automated steps we have implemented in our pipeline :    * derive mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates using an image of the slitmask ; * identify lines and fit 2d wavelength solutions using isolated helium lamp exposures on a chip - by - chip basis ; * refit new centroids for blended helium lines using nonlinear simultaneous gaussian fitting on a slit - by - slit basis ; * fit for improved mapping of 2d wavelength solutions ; * shift the wavelength maps using 2 - 3 night sky emission lines ( e.g. , [ o i ] 5577 , na 5890 , [ o i ] 6300 ) ;    we start with a distortion map for the camera , defined from previous exposures of the field around the globular cluster palomar 5 , to compute the approximate mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates for the objects in the multislit mask .",
    "sextractor is run on a direct image of the slit mask and a simple pattern analysis matches up the predicted positions of the slits and the measured positions of the slits to create an adjusted mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates .    with a theoretical dispersion curve for the prism , we generate a trivariate mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates that is wavelength dependent .",
    "sextractor is run on a helium comparison lamp image and the resulting catalog of the 3,000 to 4,000 helium lines is pattern - matched to the predicted positions of 8 unblended helium lines ( out of the 11 lines in our line list ) .",
    "new wavelength mappings are solved for as the order of the fit is gradually increased .",
    "the nearly final solutions generated at this stage are first order rescalings of the theoretical dispersion , with coefficients that are cubic ( check ! ) polynomials of the sky coordinates .",
    "the typical rms at this stage is 0.4 pixels ( check ) . with these solutions ,",
    "we can now generate predicted positions for the complete helium line list and fit gaussian profiles to the full line list for each slit . within each slit ,",
    "the gaussians are fit simultaneously , providing accurate positions for both the unblended and blended helium lines .",
    "using these new positions for the helium lines in ccd coordinates , we derive through iteration , the trivariate mapping between ccd coordinates and both wavelength and sky positions , with a typical final rms scatter of 0.25 pixels . for ldp data this scatter corresponds to @xmath61at @xmath62 , or @xmath63",
    "this large uncertainty in the wavelength calibration in the far red is due to the fact that the dispersion reaches @xmath64 / pixel at @xmath62 ; the scatter of @xmath65  introduces a 25% uncertainty in @xmath66 at such wavelengths when computing the flux calibration . because the resolution with the udp is @xmath67 higher at these red wavelengths , this additional source of uncertainty is negligible for those data .",
    "the final step involves cross - correlating simulated night sky emission lines ( [ oi]5577 , na i 5890 , and [ oi]6300 ) placed at their predicted positions with the spectra in the science frames , on a slit - by - slit basis .",
    "the median offset in both @xmath68 and @xmath69 is then applied to the wavelength mappings found from the nearest helium lamp exposure .      due to the unique nature of these prism data , the science frames must also be processed in a nonstandard fashion using custom written routines .",
    "we take particular care in the extraction of spectra because of the small number of pixels covered by each object , the faint optical limits we expect to probe , and the proximity of the objects to slit ends where residual sky counts can bias simple extraction algorithms . starting with the two 2-dimensional spectra ( here denoted `` a '' and `` b '' ) of each galaxy that come from the nod - and - shuffle observations , the basic processing steps are as follows :    *",
    "subtract spectrum a from b , and b from a ; * divide by a normalized flat - field , using pixels only covered by spectrum a ; * optimally extract each object within a given exposure , adopting a wavelength - dependent gauss - hermite expansion of the spatial profiles for each object , and using the pixels of the a and b spectra simultaneously ; * solve for the global translation , rotation , and scale changes in the object positions due to slitmask misalignment ; * fix the object positions and redo the optimal extractions , deriving new gauss - hermite moments and 1d spectra . *",
    "combine the data from all exposures of an object into a single extracted spectrum .",
    "a more detailed description of these steps follows .",
    "initially we subtract the night sky background spectrum , using the `` b '' spectrum as the sky for the `` a '' spectrum , and vice versa .",
    "next we divide the results by a normalized flat - field using the pixel locations of the `` a '' spectrum for both `` a '' and `` b '' spectra ( reminder to the reader unfamiliar with the details of nod & shuffle : electrons counted in the `` b '' pixels originated in the `` a '' pixels ) .",
    "recovering the one - dimensional spectra of the objects in the slitlets is now possible , but several additional steps and some care are required , because of the proximity of the objects to the ends of the slitlets , and given the relatively short nods ( @xmath70 arcsec ) .",
    "our procedure is a modification of the standard optimal extraction @xcite with several key differences .",
    "crucially we can use both the `` a '' and `` b '' spectra simultaneously to measure the spatial profile of a given object .",
    "we employ a gauss - hermite decomposition of the spatial profile , with moments that are low - order legendre polynomial functions of wavelength .",
    "an iterative routine also solves for the centroid of the gaussian as a low - order polynomial of wavelength . the second moment ( e.g. , standard deviation of the gaussian )",
    "is also determined as yet another low - order function of wavelength . a first guess for the one - dimensional spectrum of the object",
    "can be obtained using this gaussian approximation for the spatial profile , by solving for the b - spline ( dierckx 1983 ) that fits the `` a '' and `` b '' data , both normalized by the wavelength - dependent gaussian spatial profile . with this approximate spectrum ,",
    "we resolve for the parameters of the spatial profile , including up to 4 hermite moments ( 10 for spectrophotometric flux standards ) , each also wavelength - dependent .",
    "the wavelength binning of each slitlet is preserved , defined by the wavelength solution at its location .    with a first set of extracted spectra and , more importantly , object moments , in all eight ccds of a given exposure",
    ", we analyze the difference between the predicted object positions and the detected object positions .",
    "deviations are well described by a linear function of coordinates in the slitmask , largely the result of small misalignments when the observations were taken .",
    "we use this new linear function to fix the object positions , re - compute spatial profiles , and re - extract object spectra .    using the spatial profiles of each observation of a given object",
    ", we have a final procedure that solves for the one - dimensional spectrum using all exposures simultaneously , using the flux calibration ( see below ) so that all data are now in physical units .",
    "we fix the first and second moments to those determined above , and employ a similar optimal extraction routine to that described earlier , but one which uses the `` a '' and `` b '' spectra of all the exposures , recomputing the higher - order hermite moments of the spatial profiles and solving for a b - spline that best represents the spectrum of the object in a least - squares sense . pixels are weighted according to the inverse of the expected noise .",
    "bad columns and flagged pixels are given zero weight .",
    "iteration allows us to flag and reject most cosmic rays .",
    "the process performs an optimal extraction that yields a single 1d spectrum that matches all the data in a least - squares sense .",
    "given the small differences between the wavelength solutions of the exposures , we sample the one - dimensional b - spline representation of the spectrum at a fixed set of wavelengths , defined by the dispersion of the prism at the center of the field .",
    "this fixed grid greatly simplifies the construction of templates for fitting the seds .",
    "spectra for objects repeated in overlapping slitmasks were not combined at this stage , but kept separate  for this paper  so that we could better assess data quality and empirically estimate our redshift precision .",
    "approximately 10% of the galaxies were repeated ; we discuss these below in the context of the redshifts and their uncertainties .",
    "approximately 20% of the objects observed with the ldp were also reobserved with the udp .",
    "accurate flux calibration of the spectra is a critical component of the survey because the relative slope of a spectrum provides useful information for the determination of redshift . for csi",
    "we choose bright hydrogen white dwarf standard stars with deep , broad balmer lines that can be detected with the ldp / udp .",
    "deep balmer lines are required because we expose these stars in the alignment star boxes and the positions of the absorption lines allow us to refine the zeropoints of the wavelength calibrations for the stars when they are not accurately centered in the boxes .",
    "the processing of standard star exposures is similar to that described above , with the following modifications .",
    "first , to capture essentially all of the photons from the star , we place it in the center of an alignment star box on one of our slitmasks . by doing so we can infer the wavelength calibration for the alignment star box by using the trivariate wavelength solution of the helium lamp exposure obtained immediately after the standard star .    in order to derive the sensitivity function , we must first compensate for the fact that the seeing in the standard star exposure leads to different resolution than one would obtain with a narrow slit .",
    "we make an assumption that the seeing was isotropic and that the gauss - hermite parameterization of the spatial profile is a valid descriptor of the seeing profile in the dispersion direction . using this profile as a kernel , we deconvolve the extracted spectrum using an implementation of clean @xcite , convolving the result to a resolution equivalent to that defined by the science data ( fwhm=4.5 pixels ) .",
    "due to time and weather constraints , spectrophotometric flux standards were not obtained during every night , but the excellent run - to - run repeatability of the relative flux calibration from 8500  to 4500  for the ldp and from 9000  to 4500  for the udp , of approximately @xmath71 allows us to use flux standards obtained on different nights or during different runs .",
    "with flux calibrated spectra and broadband photometry in hand , a suitable library of template spectra can now be employed to estimate spectrophotometric redshifts . in this section",
    "we describe the basis functions in our templates , implement a generalized maximum likelihood method and estimate confidence limits for the redshifts of each galaxy along with several other parameters and properties .    here",

    "we adopt a simple set of stellar population basis functions : these components are sensitive to different timescales of a galaxy s star formation history ; in combination , they reproduce the broad range of sed properties seen in normal galaxies .    the first base component is a constant star formation model with a starting epoch of @xmath73 .",
    "the time at which star formation ceases for this component is a free parameter our analysis , a grid of values ranging from @xmath74 yr to @xmath75 yr prior to the redshift of observation ( capped at @xmath76 ) , whose values are spaced logarithmically with an interval of 0.10 dex .",

    "lastly , these are all replicated with extinctions of @xmath83 mag in an effort to reproduce the effects of complexity in the geometries of dust attenuation than simple screen models .",
    "in addition to the continuum components , we include several emission line components : ( 1 ) a single unresolved gaussian emission line for [ oii]3727 , ( 2 ) a blend of three gaussians at [ oiii]5007 , [ oiii]4959 , and h@xmath84 , with ratios of @xmath85 , to broadly mimic the typical line ratios seen in galaxies at the masses we expected ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 2003 ) , ( 3 ) a gaussian for h@xmath86 , and ( 4 ) an unresolved emission line for mgi2799 . because of the increasing uncertainties in the flux calibration of ldp data beyond 8000 , no emission lines were allowed beyond that point in those fits .",

    "we have computed confidence limits for every parameter , and for several derived combinations of parameters such as stellar mass or a broad range of restframe colors . with these confidence limits , and a broad array of data quality measures , such as @xmath58 ratios , minimum @xmath90 , @xmath90 at the peak of the likelihood function , and the confidence limits themselves",
    ", we can identify the highest quality sample possible with the current dataset .",
    "several criteria are used to eliminate substandard results .",
    "a number of measures were judged to be helpful , including @xmath90 for the best - fit template at a given @xmath58 ratio , the number of pixels not flagged as bad or contaminated , or unphysical inferred rest frame colors . the final criterion used to define our high quality sample was to restrict the set to those galaxies with formal 95% uncertainties in rest frame @xmath103 of @xmath104 mag ( equivalent to @xmath105 mag ) .",

    "example results of the sed fitting illustrating a broad range of redshifts and spectral types from our high quality sample are shown in figures [ fig : examples1 ] and [ fig : examples2 ] .",
    "given that our sample is more effectively reaching higher redshifts at a given stellar mass than optically selected surveys such as deep2 and primus , we now turn to characterizing the accuracy of our redshifts .      in a spectroscopic galaxy survey , the degree to which the population is sampled can be characterized by two quantities : the success rate ( fraction of _ targeted _ galaxies for which usable spectra are obtained ) and the completeness ( fraction of the original _ photometric _ that is observed and usable spectra obtained ) .",
    "the latter quantity necessarily is necessary dependent on the former , and includes the effect of slit collisions . in figures [ fig : comp ] ( top ) and ( bottom ) we plot success rates and completeness as functions of @xmath0 m , @xmath23 , and @xmath22 magnitudes . for galaxies brighter than @xmath106 mag the current pipeline produces a mean success rate of 70% and mean completeness of 38% .",
    "in detail we model the completeness as a 2d function of both @xmath0 m magnitude and @xmath107 $ ] color , and for illustrative purposes we have overplotted the mean success rate and completeness within broad color bins ( though our subsequent analysis employed finer color bins when modeling the incompleteness ) .",
    "spectroscopic surveys such as csi that intend to study the density dependence of galaxy properties must carefully model the effect of slit collisions on the completeness .",
    "to accomplish this we divided our sample into bins based on local source density .",
    "the footprint of a csi spectrum is @xmath108 pixels long , or @xmath109 arcmin . for every target and observed galaxy , we compute the local source density within @xmath110 arcmin@xmath2 . in figure [ fig : comp ] we show the mean completeness as a function of source density computed on this scale .",

    ", we can directly multiply the two for every galaxy in the final sample .",
    "in subsequent , and relevant analysis , one can employ weights defined as the inverse of these completeness estimates . for those galaxies with multiple observations",
    ", we currently divide these weights by @xmath113 , the number of observations , though more complicated procedures may be devised at a future date .",
    "we have tested the validity of these density - dependent completeness corrections by recomputing the local source densities based on the high - quality spectroscopic sample alone .",
    "on the scales of @xmath109 arcmin , the agreement is very good , with a scatter of approximately @xmath114 dex . on larger scales , of 2 or 4",
    "arcmin , the agreement is even better with scatters of @xmath115 dex at a given density .",
    "these corrections , and the accuracy with which they can reproduce the original source densities , are crucial for ensuring confidence in the galaxy group mass estimates derived below .",
    "we have three different methods at our disposal for evaluating the accuracy of csi redshifts : ( 1 ) directly comparing our results with several hundred optically - selected high - resolution spectroscopic redshifts in the vvds sample @xcite ; ( 2 ) deriving uncertainties using the large number of objects with repeat measurements ; and ( 3 ) employing the @xcite pairwise velocity approach , in which galaxy groups and large scale structures mean that large numbers of galaxies lie at the same redshifts , effectively providing repeat redshift measurements of cosmic structures .",
    "all three methods give consistent estimates of the redshift uncertainty to @xmath116 mag and/or @xmath117 . at fainter magnitudes and higher",
    "redshift there is insufficient overlap to empirically characterize the redshift errors using the vvds .",
    "however , to these limits , these checks on our redshift uncertainties all show good agreement .",
    "in our sample of galaxies with high quality redshifts , there are 400 with vvds spectroscopic measurements ; figure [ fig : vvds ] compares these redshifts .",
    "we have visually inspected and verified redshifts of the vimos spectra of these objects common to the vvds and csi , in a few cases revising vvds redshifts and quality flags . for vvds objects flagged as ` low quality ' ( 3 & 2 )",
    ", we were not able to verify all redshifts ; we nevertheless include them here , using smaller points in figure [ fig : vvds ] .    for the 191 galaxies with high quality vvds measurements , 91% of the redshifts agree to within @xmath118 , with 96% within @xmath119 .",
    "the standard deviation for this subsample is @xmath120 ( using @xmath121 mad median absolute deviation ; * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : vvds ] we show the @xmath124 scaters in different magnitude bins also derived using @xmath121 mad . note that these values include a number of galaxies with low quality vvds redshifts . for galaxies down to the primus selection limit of @xmath6 mag ,",
    "the scatter is @xmath125 .",
    "fainter than @xmath6 mag , the scatter rises to @xmath126 . for galaxies selected by csi to be between @xmath127 ,",
    "we find @xmath128 , though the distribution is non - gaussian and the subsample largely contains objects with low quality vvds redshifts .    the comparisons between our redshifts and those made available by the vvds have allowed us to confirm that our procedures are working well .",
    "however , a larger numbers of galaxies is required to accurately characterize redshift uncertainties as a function of magnitude , color , or spectral type . fortunately , we have two additional tests to help us probe the accuracy of our redshifts .",
    "the data from individual slit masks were reduced independently , and so repeat measurements can be compared .",
    "these comprise approximately 20% of the measured redshifts , providing a sample large enough to be analyzed as a function of galaxy properties , such as magnitude , color , stellar mass , or redshift . without prior constraints or measurements for the derived properties of these objects",
    "we adopt the mean of multiple measurements when plotting or analyzing the distributions as functions of redshift . in figure",

    "is @xmath129 at @xmath130 , @xmath131 for @xmath132 . as can be seen in the third panel ,",
    "the width of the distribution is a stronger function of optical magnitude than near - ir magnitude because our sed fitting is dominated by the imacs spectroscopy .",
    "currently , we find @xmath133 at 22.5 mag @xmath134 24 mag , and @xmath135 at 24 mag @xmath136 25.2 mag . planned refinements in the pipeline are expected to improve the fidelity of the extracted spectra for such faint sources as the csi survey progresses .",
    "the redshift uncertainties are dissected further in figure [ fig : repeats_z2 ] by breaking up the sample into three redshift ranges and plotting against @xmath58 ratios of the imacs spectra , stellar mass , star formation activity , and rest frame @xmath137 color . from these panels",
    "one can see that the redshift errors are not strongly correlated with spectral type or color , unlike the typical dependencies seen in photometric redshifts .",
    "there is a rather small , subtle dependence on spectral type : quiescent galaxies ( those with a negligible specific star formation rate and hence strong balmer/4000  breaks ) and strongly starforming galaxies have the greatest precision , while galaxies with modest or intermediate sfr have degraded redshift precision .",
    "weak [ oii]3727  emission at high redshift and observed at low resolution can appear blended with the 4000  break break and produce spectra that are reasonably well fit by an sed with a balmer break and no [ oii]3727 .",
    "more specifically , [ oii]3727  is imperfectly correlated with the sfr inferred from the stellar continuum , leading to an additional uncertainty in the redshifts at the @xmath138 level , depending on the @xmath58 ratio of the spectra , and even when not particularly statistically significant .",
    "this effect is substantially less pronounced for udp data , where the higher resolution of the disperser shifts the wavelength of such [ oii]3727  confusion farther to the red .",
    "this power of the higher resolution udp is illustrated in the last sed of figure [ fig : examples1 ] , in an old galaxy at @xmath139 with [ oii]3727  line emission ( likely a liner , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "again , this problem with low resolution spectroscopy is only important for `` green '' galaxies ; the bulk of the galaxy population , lying in the blue cloud and red sequence ( with strong [ oii]3727  and balmer breaks respectively ) , is unaffected .        while the abundance of repeat spectroscopic measurements has allowed us to characterize the redshift uncertainties , repeated spectra of any given object are fine - tuned with the same broadband photometry as described in section [ subsec : fitting ] . for some galaxies",
    "this can in principle introduce artificially tight correlations between the repeat spectroscopic measurements .",
    "presumably , this issue becomes a serious problem only if the broad - band photometry is allowed to have greater weight in the likelihood analysis .",
    "this never occurs in our procedures , in particular because the number of data points in the udp and ldp spectra far exceed the number of photometric bands .",
    "even when the @xmath58 ratios of the spectra are low , binning these data over the photometric bandpasses yield @xmath58 ratios that still exceed what obtains from the photometry for those fainter galaxies . even with these reasons to trust the analysis of the repeat measurements ,",
    "we employ yet another means to assess the redshift errors in the next section .",
    "because galaxies largely exist in close pairs , in groups , in clusters , and in even larger coherent structures , all of which have velocity widths smaller than the redshift errors we expect in our data and analysis , the distribution of redshift errors can be inferred statistically from the distribution of pairwise redshift differences in a given sample .",
    "this technique was first explored and described by @xcite in an effort to derive the redshift uncertainties in photometric redshift surveys , where a lack of repeat measurements and limited templates can hamper one s ability to estimate uncertainties .",
    "any methodology relying explicitly on clustering requires dense spatial sampling in order to extract a high @xmath58 signal from the pairwise velocity histograms . while photometric redshift surveys , by definition , result in the highest possible spatial sampling , the spatial sampling of csi is limited by slit collisions .",
    "this limits the number of galaxy pairs available to perform this analysis , compared to what would be obtained in a purely photometric redshift survey .",
    "we divided our sample into subsets based on @xmath22-band magnitude and redshift and constructed pairwise velocity histograms .",
    "for the subsamples based on magnitude , we used those galaxies brighter than a given bin as a reference set , assuming those galaxies have more precise redshifts .",
    "while @xcite chose to randomize the positions in their dataset to correct for close pairs that arise only in projection , we opted to randomize the galaxy velocities since our slit - placement constraints lead to nontrivial spatial dependencies .",
    "care was taken to properly normalize the histograms derived from the randomized distributions , as the number of galaxies in them , by definition , is too large by the number of galaxies within coherent velocity structures . because this number can not be precisely defined _ a priori _ , it must be deduced from the data  from the wings of the histograms .",
    "we made several realizations to reduce the poisson noise imposed by the randomization process .",
    "the results of these experiments are shown in figure [ fig : quadricompare ] as the red histogram .",
    "overplotted are the @xmath140 confidence limits on our redshifts , shown in blue , and computed by dividing the @xmath141 confidence limits by four .",
    "the green filled circles are the expected standard deviations of the pairwise velocity histograms for galaxies with redshift uncertainties shown in blue .",
    "overall the @xcite method has reinforced the validity of the redshift uncertainties derived from our generalized likelihood analysis down to faint magnitudes , and from our comparisons to the relatively bright vvds sample .",
    "this result should be of general interest , since the @xcite method was in part devised to remedy the deficiency that photometric redshift surveys do not provide repeat measurements of a given galaxy .",
    "however , any spatially dense survey will provide repeat measurements of ( relatively ) cold cosmic structures , so the @xcite methodology remains a valuable technique for any spatially dense spectroscopic or photometric redshift survey  any survey where one does not have repeat observations with which to characterize uncertainties empirically .",
    "based on these three methods , we conclude that our random redshift uncertainties have been reliably characterized , and also that systematic uncertainties appear to be minimal . in particular",
    "we stress that our redshift errors are not strongly dependent on relative star formation activity , spectral type , or color .",

    "by doing so csi will uncover the extent to which the growth in the number density of passive galaxies over the past @xmath109 of the lifetime of the universe can be attributed to group - related processes such as , for example , galaxy - galaxy interactions ( leading to differential number density evolution between groups and galaxies ) , and/or a decrease in the available fuel for on - going star formation ( leaving galaxy number densities unchanged ) . given",
    "that most galaxies in groups are `` red and dead '' even at @xmath21 @xcite , the mass selection , high spectral coverage , and color - insensitive redshift accuracy of csi will all be critical elements in characterizing relatively poor groups at high redshift .",
    "subsequent csi analyses will also focus on , for example , agn and any connections to group and/or host galaxy properties , on differences between centrals and satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and on merger rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as functions of environment .",

    "<S> this first paper provides an overview of the survey selection , observations , processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe the processing of the data : new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energy distributions are used to derive redshifts , stellar masses , emission line luminosities , and coarse information on recent star - formation . our unique methodology for analyzing low - dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prisms in _ imacs </S>",
    "<S> _ , combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the ir , has yielded 37,000 high quality redshifts in our first 5.3 degs@xmath2 of the swire xmm - lss field . </S>",
    "<S> we use three different approaches to estimate our redshift errors and find robust agreement . over the full range of @xmath0 m fluxes of our selection , </S>",
    "<S> we find typical uncertainties of @xmath3 . in comparisons with previously published vvds redshifts , for example </S>",
    "<S> , we find a scatter of @xmath4 for galaxies at @xmath5 . for galaxies brighter and fainter than @xmath6 mag , </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> notably , our low - dispersion spectroscopy and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates for both red and blue galaxies , largely eliminating color - based systematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment . </S>"
