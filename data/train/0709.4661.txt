    "considering the convolution of @xmath0-independent random variables associated with @xmath307 , it has been shown that the triplet of parameters @xmath302 corresponds in fact to @xmath308 , or simply @xmath309 following mapping relations . in this way",

    "the physical interpretation of these as well as other relations between entropic indices constitutes an interesting open challenge .",
    "finally , let us mention the fact that the central limit theorem results appear to also be applicable to the sum of deterministic variables  @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that , when the maximum lyapunov exponent is positive , the sum of deterministic variables obtained from some dynamical process leads to a gaussian distribution .",
    "recently , studies on the sum of deterministic variables obtained from dissipative and conservative systems have been made .",
    "for the logistic map  @xcite ( dissipative system ) at the edge of the chaos ( vanishing lyapunov exponent ) it has been verified that the intermediate part and the tail of the distribution are consistent with a @xmath0-gaussian distribution .",
    "concerning conservative systems , studies on the hamiltonian mean field  model @xcite at its metastable state have shown the emergence of non - gaussian attracting probability density functions when the sum of velocities is performed .",
    "these resulting distributions have been numerically quite well approached by @xmath0-gaussians over its whole range of values .",
