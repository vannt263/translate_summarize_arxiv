    "polymer brushes , _",
    "i.e. _ polymer chains grafted onto substrates , have been drawing broad attention of physicists , chemists , and others  @xcite .",
    "polymer brushes also play a vital role in industrial applications , _",
    "e.g. _ surface coating , wetting , and colloidal stabilization  @xcite .",
    "diblock - copolymer brushes and multicomponent - homopolymer brushes , _",
    "i.e. _ sophisticated brushes , have been extensively studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "polymers grafted onto spherical substrates or colloids have also drawn significant attention  @xcite .",
    "these complicated brushes show various phenomena according to the molecular architecture , mixing ratio between the polymer species , curvature and shape of the substrate , and other unique characteristics of each system",
    ". however , unique phase behavior of each system originated from such unique characteristics obstructs studies on the universal phase behavior of polymer brushes .    therefore , the most basic and simplest polymer brush , _",
    "i.e. _ single - component linear homopolymers homogeneously grafted onto a planar substrate , was simulated in 3 dimensions ( 3-d ) using the molecular monte carlo method to determine the universal and structural phase behavior of polymer brushes  @xcite .",
    "the simulation results showed that 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) microphase separation of the grafted polymers in the lateral direction of the substrate occurs at low temperature .",
    "various lateral domain patterns to minimize the interfacial free energy between low and high - density domains of the polymers are revealed .",
    "these domain patterns are similar to those found in diblock copolymer melts at microphase separation .",
    "these results demonstrate that topological constraints , _",
    "i.e. _ the grafting points of the brushes and connecting points between blocks of each block copolymer , universally yield the microphase separation and various domain patterns , independently of the unique characteristics of each system .",
    "early researchers also studied the single - component linear homopolymers grafted onto planar substrates and found one domain pattern ; small circular clusters of the grafted polymers distributed over the substrate  @xcite .",
    "however , determination of the spatial arrangement of these circular clusters was reserved for future study .",
    "furthermore , these early researchers missed the possibility of the other domain patterns .",
    "another universal structural phase behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ percolation and concomitant critical phenomena , has never been investigated in the homopolymer brush .",
    "percolation transition is related to various physical phenomena and industrial applications , such as forest fire , diffusion in disordered media , string - like colloical assembly , and nano - switching devices  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , according to the general percolation theory  @xcite , critical phenomena , such as fractal structure of the percolation cluster and power law of cluster size distribution , are observed at the transition .",
    "we demonstrate that the percolation and critical phenomena also occur in brushes in the lateral direction of the substrate .",
    "the fractal structure of the percolation cluster of the grafted polymers is revealed and analyzed for the first time .",
    "the lateral structure of the brush depends on these phenomena as well as the 2-d microphase separation .",
    "these are also important for application , such as surface patterning , friction , and 2-d nano - switching devices .    giving thought experiments , here we qualitatively discuss the percolation transition of the brush .",
    "mushrooms of the grafted homopolymers are isolated from each other at extremely low @xmath0 , where @xmath0 denotes the grafting density .",
    "in contrast , a polymer layer continuous in the lateral direction of the substrate covers the whole substrate at extremely high @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that , when @xmath0 rises from the extremely low value , percolation clusters of the grafted polymers , which bridge both the edges of the substrate , appear at an intermediate value of @xmath0 .",
    "this percolation threshold ( transition density ) depends on the temperature , denoted by @xmath1 , and the quality of the solvent because the size of the mushroom is dependent on these parameters .",
    "therefore , a percolation transition line is constructed in @xmath2-plane , in which typical phase diagrams of brushes are constructed for the sake of studying effects of the solvent quality and grafting density on the phase behavior  @xcite . simulating the homopolymer brush in a coarse - grained scale using the molecular monte carlo method , we study these percolation and critical phenomena in the present work . the transition line , values of critical exponents , and fractal dimension of the percolation clusters are determined .",
    "we also discuss the relation between the percolation transition and microphase separation of the brush .",
    "in the present work , we employ a 3-d solvent - free coarse - grained model  @xcite of single - component linear homopolymers proposed by mller and daoulas  @xcite .",
    "this was also utilized in our recent work  @xcite and quickly summarized in the present section .",
    "the solvent - free model explicitly integrates out degrees of freedom of solvents , which are replaced with an effective non - bonded potential between solutes .",
    "this drastically diminishes degrees of freedom of the system and results in significantly reduced computational time required for simulation of the polymer brush laid in 3-d .",
    "harmonic spring potential , denoted by @xmath3 , with the spring constant @xmath4 linearly connects the coarse - grained segments in each polymer , where @xmath5 denotes the distance between the centers of the pair of the connected segments and @xmath6 is the number of segments per polymer .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the root mean square of the end to end distance of an ideal chain with the same molecular architecture .",
    "this @xmath7 is chosen as the unit length .",
    "this spring potential corresponds to the bonded interaction potential between the segments .",
    "the free energy of non - bonded interactions in the solvent - free model is given by a functional , @xmath8 , of the local segment density .",
    "we employ a third - order expansion of the non - bonded interaction free energy in a form of powers of the local segment density : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 denotes the local volumetric number density of the segments at the spatial coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "the positive dimensionless constants , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , set the attractive and repulsive interaction strengths among the segments , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the dimensionless local polymer density .",
    "first , the phase behavior of a bulk solution of the non - grafted polymers modelled using the solvent - free system is discussed .",
    "this underlies the phase behavior of the brush of our model system  @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless average volumetric polymer density of the solution is denoted by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number of polymers and the system volume , respectively . at extremely large @xmath13 and finite @xmath14 , macrophase separation of the polymers",
    "occurs , which results in a dense droplet floating in a dilute gas .",
    "in contrast , at finite @xmath13 and extremely high @xmath14 , the system is in a homogeneous phase . the binodal line in @xmath19-plane at fixed @xmath14 is determined using mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "the critical point of this binodal line is denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( ref .",

    "this value of @xmath14 determines @xmath24 , which was @xmath25 and @xmath26 in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the present value of @xmath27 , reduced from the previous work , decreases @xmath17 in a region of @xmath28 , in which the simulation is performed .",
    "therefore , with the present value of @xmath23 , the amount of computation is significantly reduced , compared with the previous value of @xmath14 . the binodal line , calculated based on the mean - field theory at this fixed @xmath23 in the present work , is shown with a solid black line in fig .

    "these features of the brush change the effective value of @xmath97 and both the percolation and non - percolation phases are observed in the present system , although the corresponding conventional lattice model is always in the percolation phase .",
    "this inhomogeneity of the lattice also indicates that , as discussed in section  [ sec : simulationmethods ] , the simulation results do not significantly change when the grafting points are randomly distributed over the substrate .",
