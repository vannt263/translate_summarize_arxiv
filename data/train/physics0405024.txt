    "the van der waals gradient theory @xcite was originally developed at the end of the 19-th century as an `` effective '' physical picture to describe the critical region .",
    "this theory considers a local helmholtz free - energy composed of two parts .",
    "the first one describes the homogeneous behaviour of the system , while the second part characterizes the non - homogeneous one . in addition , the first part is proportional to the fluid density @xmath0 while the second one is proportional to the square of the density gradient .",
    "much effort has been devoted to apply the van der waals gradient theory to various fluids . at present , it can be considered as the most simple and comprehensive model in the physics of interfaces and capillarity .",
    "the associated hydrodynamic equations can be written as @xmath1 } , \\label{korteweg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a function of the density @xmath0 and of @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 is the current velocity .",
    "this formulation of the van der waals theory was originally due to korteweg @xcite , who proposed a continuum mechanical model in which the cauchy stress tensor apart from the standard cauchy - poisson term contains an additional term defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the unit tensor . as already mentioned by dunn and serrin @xcite , the modern terminology concerning the korteweg model refers to elastic materials of grade @xmath7 , where the particular case of @xmath8 has been well studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ korteweg ] ) have been linked recently @xcite to a nonlinear schrdinger equation viewed as a particular set of hydrodynamic equations describing the so - called nonlinear madelung fluid @xcite .",
    "this link between capillarity and the schrdinger equation can shed more light onto the so - called quantum - like approach to many - particle systems such as beams in particle accelerators and beam - plasma systems . the standard procedure in this direction is to approximate the physical systems characterized by an overall interaction with a suitable van der waals mean field theory .    to avoid misunderstanding ,",
    "it is worthwhile to note that schrdinger equation alone does not provide an entire quantum mechanical picture . it should be necessarily supplemented by a theory of quantum measurement and consequently by a proper physical interpretation of wave packets . in the quantum - like approach ,",
    "the many - particle systems are described in an effective way as a whole .",
    "based on the above considerations , it appears interesting and attractive to explore the possibility of a rigorous derivation from kinetic theory of the general hydrodynamic picture thus discussed .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the equation for the microscopic phase space density @xmath9 @xmath10 } = 0 , \\label{micphspdens}\\ ] ] for a system consisting of @xmath11 particles , which occupies volume @xmath12 in the configuration space . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coordinates and the canonically conjugate momenta , @xmath15 is the particle mass and @xmath16 is the microscopic force , which apart from the external force includes a part specifying the type of interaction between particles .",
    "suppose that at some initial time @xmath17 the microscopic phase space density is known to be @xmath18 .",
    "then , the formal solution of equation ( [ micphspdens ] ) for arbitrary time @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the evolution operator , specifying the hamiltonian flow .",
    "the choice of the initial @xmath22 is based on the knowledge of the microscopic characteristics of the system . due to the extremely complex particles dynamics ,",
    "full consistent description is not feasible .",
    "therefore , the detailed information on the microscopic level is incomplete .",
    "if our system is a complex one in the sense that both the external forces and the collective forces are highly nonlinear , a dynamic instability of motion is likely to occur on a characteristic time scale @xmath23 .",
    "the only information available to an outside observer by means of a macroscopic measuring device is a coarse - grained density distribution with a smoothing function , which takes into account the dynamic instability of motion .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath24 where for simplicity the explicit dependence on the momentum variables @xmath14 has been suppressed . to take into account the initial preparation of the system , one has to displace the initial time @xmath17 at @xmath25 and perform an average over the past history of the system",

    "there is however , an important conceptual difference between the two equations . in the bgk equation",
    "the function @xmath45 should be replaced by the equilibrium distribution function @xmath46 describing the global equilibrium and the characteristic time @xmath23 should be replaced by the corresponding relaxation time . the smoothed distribution function in equation ( [ onepartdfsms ] )",
    "characterizes a local quasi - equilibrium state within the smallest unit cell of continuous medium , while @xmath23 is the corresponding time scale .",
    "rather than following the standard approach in deriving the hydrodynamic picture , we introduce the characteristic function @xmath47 instead .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath48 satisfies the following equation @xmath49 note that the local moments @xmath50 can be obtained from the characteristic function according to the relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the well - known hydrodynamic quantities , such as the mass density @xmath0 , the mean velocity @xmath53 of a fluid element and the hydrodynamic stress tensor @xmath54 can be defined as @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 here , @xmath58 , implies the thermodynamic limit . defining also the deviation from the mean velocity as @xmath59 and using the evident relation @xmath60",
    "we can represent the stress tensor @xmath61 according to the relation @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the internal stress tensor .",
    "equation ( [ charfunceq ] ) and the one obtained after differentiating with respect to @xmath64 evaluated at @xmath65 , yield the smoluchowski equation and the equation for the momentum balance , respectively .",

    "we argue that there exists a backward velocity @xmath71 such that @xmath72 the transformed smoluchowski equation ( [ contineq ] ) can be represented according to @xmath73 } = - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } \\nabla_k \\nabla_l { \\left ( b_{kl } \\varrho \\right)}. \\label{contineqb}\\ ] ] summing up and subtracting equations ( [ contineq ] ) and ( [ contineqb ] ) , we obtain the continuity equation @xmath74 and the fick s law @xmath75 here @xmath76 are the current and the osmotic velocity , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that since the mean velocity of a fluid element is a generic function of time @xmath19 , it can be split into odd and even part .",
    "note that from equation ( [ currentosm ] ) it follows that @xmath77 , where @xmath4 is the odd part , while @xmath78 is the even part .",
    "equation ( [ momentbal ] ) for the balance of momentum can be written alternatively as @xmath79 after performing a time inversion in equation ( [ momentbalb ] ) , we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the transformed internal stress tensor after performing the time inversion . summing up the last two equations , we arrive at the sought - for equation for the current velocity @xmath82 where @xmath83 in order to find the explicit form of the internal stress tensor ( [ internstdef ] ) , we observe that the maximum entropy of the system is realized , provided the small source in the generalized kinetic equation ( [ onepartdfsms ] ) vanishes .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the condition of detailed balance in the case , where the collision integral ( small source ) is approximated by a fokker - planck operator .",
    "the condition of detailed balance implies that the distribution function factorizes in the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a normalizable function . from the above considerations",
    ", it follows directly that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath88 is the temperature .",
    "+ in the simplest case , where the external force vanishes and the diffusion tensor is diagonal and isotropic , @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic equations describing a free capillary fluid have been recovered .",
    "+ in the case , where an external force is applied , the korteweg stress tensor contains an additional term proportional to the drift coefficient @xmath92 . on the other hand from the principle of detailed balance",
    ", it follows that the drift coefficient is proportional to the external force .",
    "the physical implication of the latter is that the additional term in the korteweg stress tensor can be regarded as a coupling between the external field and the mean field of purely hydrodynamical origin .",
    "since a detailed information about the system on the microscopic level is incomplete , one possible way to take into account its initial preparation , i. e. an eventual dynamic instability of motion that might have set in and/or other large - scale characteristics , is to introduce a suitable smoothing procedure . as a result ,",
    "the kinetic equation providing an unified kinetic , hydrodynamic and diffusion description contains a small source and is therefore irreversible .",
    "although the effective collision integral ( small source ) can be represented as a kramers - moyal expansion , for the purposes of the present paper it suffices to consider the right - hand - side of the generalized kinetic equation as approximated with a properly defined fokker - planck operator .",
    "the latter form of the collision term is adopted as a starting point in the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations for capillary fluids .",
    "+ the hydrodynamic approximation is further obtained in a standard manner from the characteristic function for the local moments of the distribution function .",
    "an important feature of the approach is that the fick s law emerges naturally from the transformation properties of the hydrodynamic quantities under time inversion .",
    "the osmotic velocity is uniquely specified by the first two infinitesimal moments of the smoothing function and in a sense is a measure of the irreversibility .",
    "+ the main result of the analysis performed in this paper , the hydrodynamic equations for free capillary fluids have been derived from kinetic theory .",
    "if an external force is present , the korteweg stress tensor has to be modified accordingly .",
    "an additional term proportional to the drift coefficient emerges implying a coupling between the external field and the mean field of purely hydrodynamical origin ."
