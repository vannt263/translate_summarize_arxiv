    "the development of strategies to control the dynamic of a viral spread in a population is a central problem in public health and network security@xcite . in particular , how to control the traffic between subpopulations in the case of an epidemic outbreak is of critical importance . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the problem of controlling the spread of a disease in a population by regulating the traffic between subpopulations .",
    "the dynamic of the spread depends on both the characteristics of the subpopulation , as well as the structure and parameters of the transportation infrastructure .",
    "our work is based on a recently proposed variant of the popular sis epidemic model to the case of populations interacting through a network @xcite .",
    "we extend this model to a metapopulation framework in which large subpopulations ( i.e. , cities ) are represented as nodes in a metagraph whose links represent the transportation infrastructure connecting them ( i.e. , roads ) @xcite .",
    "we propose an extension of the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) viral propagation model to metapopulations using stochastic blockmodels @xcite .",
    "the stochastic blockmodel is a complex network model with well - defined random communities ( or blocks ) .",
    "we model each subpopulation as a random regular graph and the interaction between subpopulations using random bipartite graphs connecting adjacent subpopulations .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is that we can find the optimal traffic among subpopulations to control a viral outbreak solving a standard form convex semidefinite program .",
    "in this section we introduce some graph - theoretical nomenclature and the dynamic spreading model under consideration .",
    "let @xmath0 denote an undirected graph with @xmath1 nodes , @xmath2 edges , and no self - loops .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of nodes and by @xmath4 the set of undirected edges of @xmath5 .",
    "the number of neighbors of @xmath6 is called the _ degree _ of node i , denoted by @xmath7 . a graph with all the nodes having the same degree",
    "is called regular .",
    "the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath8 $ ] , is an @xmath9 symmetric matrix defined entry - wise as @xmath10 if nodes @xmath6 and @xmath11 are adjacent , and @xmath12 otherwise for all @xmath6 . ] .",
    "since @xmath13 is symmetric , all its eigenvalues , denoted by @xmath14 , are real . in a regular graph ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath15 is equal to the degree of its nodes @xcite , and the associated eigenvector is @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the vector of all ones of size @xmath1 ) .",
    "our modeling approach is based on the n - intertwined sis model proposed by van mieghem et at . in @xcite .",
    "consider a network of @xmath1 individuals described by the adjacency matrix @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the infection probability of an individual at node @xmath19 at time @xmath20 is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "let us assume , for now , that the viral spreading is characterized by the infection and curing rates , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , .",
    "hence , the linearized n - intertwined sis model in @xcite is described by the following differential equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . concerning the non - homogeneous epidemic model",
    ", we have the following result :    [ prop : heterogeneous sis stability condition]consider the heterogeneous n - intertwined sis epidemic model in ( [ eq : heterosis ] ) .",

    "metapopulation models are useful to characterize the dynamics of systems composed by connected subpopulations @xcite . for example , consider a population of @xmath1 individuals distributed over @xmath31 cities connected via a collection of roads . at a lower level , we can described the pattern of interactions in the entire population as a massive graph with @xmath1 nodes ( individuals ) , where an edge @xmath32 represents the interaction between two individuals @xmath6 and @xmath11 . alternatively , we can describe this population at a higher level using a much smaller graph , called the metagraph , in which nodes represent cities and edges represent roads connecting cities .    in the metapopulation model",
    ", there are two elements to take into consideration . on the one hand",
    ", we have the intrapopulation evolution , which is related to the evolution of an infection within each subpopulation , as in isolation . on the other hand",
    ", we have the subpopulation interaction , which is related to encounters between individuals from different subpopulations .",
    "we describe both elements in the following subsections .",
    "assume we partition the whole population of @xmath1 individuals into @xmath31 subpopulations of sizes @xmath33 .",
    "we denote the sets of nodes in each subpopulation by @xmath34 .",
    "we also assume that we are not given any information about the connectivity of individuals inside each subpopulation , apart from the number of nodes , @xmath35 , and the average degree @xmath7 of the individuals inside the @xmath6-th subpopulation .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to model the connectivity structure of each subpopulation as a random regular graph of size @xmath35 and degree @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the @xmath36 adjacency matrix of this random regular graph as @xmath37 . as we mentioned above , the largest eigenvalue of this random regular graphs",
    "is @xmath38 and the associated eigenvector is @xmath39 .",
    "the interaction between subpopulations is a crucial component that strongly influences the entire dynamics of the system . to model the interaction between subpopulations @xmath6 and @xmath11",
    ", we assume that a random collection of @xmath40 individuals in @xmath41 connect to a random collection of @xmath40 individuals in @xmath42 .",
    "we can algebraically represent this connectivity pattern by defining a @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 representing to the structure of a random bipartite graph connecting two sets of nodes of sizes @xmath35 and @xmath45 via @xmath40 edges .",
    "the @xmath9 adjacency matrix of the whole population of individuals described above is a random matrix , denoted by @xmath46 , that can be defined according to block matrices , as follows .",
    "first , the @xmath47-the diagonal block of the population adjacency matrix is the @xmath36 random matrix @xmath37 , defined above .",
    "second , the @xmath48-th off diagonal block is the @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 , defined above .",
    "hence , the adjacency matrix of the complete population is @xmath49.\\ ] ]    in the following subsection , we apply the n - intertwined sis epidemic model to the above adjacency matrix to derive a spectral condition for stability of a small initial infection .",
    "we use ( [ eq : heterosis ] ) to model the dynamics of an sis spreading process in a metapopulations .",
    "assume that the the sis model spreads through the individuals in population @xmath41 with an spreading rate @xmath50 .",
    "the recovery rate of individuals in population @xmath41 is @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the spreading rate of a virus from an infected individual in population @xmath11 towards a susceptible individual in population @xmath41 is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "let us define the vector @xmath52 as the @xmath35-dimensional vector containing the probabilities of infection of all the individuals in the subpopulation @xmath41 at time @xmath20 .",
    "hence , according to ( [ eq : heterosis ] ) , this vector of infection probabilities evolves as @xmath53 where the first and last terms represent the spreading and recovery dynamics within subpopulation @xmath6 .",
    "the second term accounts for the spreading of the disease from subpopulations @xmath11 to @xmath6 .",

    "we study the largest eigenvalue of @xmath58 in terms of metapopulation parameters .",
    "notice that @xmath58 is a random matrix , since its blocks represent random graphs . to analyze the largest eigenvalue of this random matrix , we make use of the following spectral concentration result from @xcite :    consider the random matrix @xmath58 , then , almost surely , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the expectation of @xmath58 .",

    "hence , the condition under which the epidemic is guaranteed die out at rate @xmath73 if @xmath74 is satisfied .",

    "the problem travel restriction problem is formally stated as @xmath78 where , since we do not consider permanent relocation between cities , we assume that @xmath79 .    the following lemma states the condition on the model parameters under which the travel restriction problem is feasible .

    "satisfying the constraints in ( [ problem ] ) if @xmath81 for all cities @xmath82 .    included in proof of theorem [ sdp ]    the constraint in lemma [ feas ] is equivalent to the condition that in each individual city the virus would die out at a rate @xmath73 with no intercity connections .",

    "multiplying by the positive definite matrix @xmath86 preserves the sign of the largest eigenvalue so we can express the relation as @xmath87 since @xmath88 is a symmetric matrix , we can express ( [ sym ] ) as the semidefinite constraint given in ( [ sdp ] ) , completing the proof of theorem [ sdp ] .    to prove lemma [ feas ]",

    "standard form semidefinite programs are solvable in polynomial time via convex optimization methods therefore , a central authority can set traffic limits on all cities in order to guarantee the epidemic dies out at rate @xmath73 while minimizing the cost .",
    "in many cases it may not be possible to compute or implement a centralized policy . if we suppose the costs are incurred locally by each city directly effected by the restriction , @xmath97 then we can compute a heuristic local solution by first having each city manager solve @xmath98 then coordinating with neighboring cities allowing traffic @xmath99 [ heur ] the local heuristic solution defined in ( [ local1 ] ) and ( [ local2 ] ) yields a feasible solution to the traffic restriction problem , ( [ problem ] ) .",

    "theorem 6.1.10 from @xcite guarantees that the matrix in ( [ mat ] ) is negative semidefinite , satisfying the eigenvalue constraint and completing the proof .",
    "the heuristic solution proposed in ( [ local1 ] ) and ( [ local2 ] ) is local in the sense that traffic restrictions on the edges in the intercity network can be computed by each city solving the optimal restrictions for the edges connecting them to other cities .",
    "two cities will not necessarily compute the same optimal restriction so the minimum of the two values is used .",
    "this is consistent with our model because all travel assumed to be is round trip , thus the realized traffic can be at most the minimum of the traffic allowed by the two cities involved .",
    "theorem [ heur ] formally guarantees that this local method yields a solution that causes the virus to die out at at least rate @xmath73 .",
    "the fraction of people who are infected is driven to 0 in every city via traffic control .",
    "the cost incurred by the local heuristic is about 33% greater than the optimal cost . ]",
    "we demonstrate the relative performance of our centralized and local solutions using a sample problem with randomly generated parameters .",
    "we choose the cost function @xmath104 because it is convex and satisfies ( [ sep ] ) .",
    "furthermore , ( [ cost ] ) intuitively captures the cost of restricting traffic on each edge because there is no cost when traffic is unrestricted ( i.e. @xmath105 ) but the cost tends to @xmath106 as @xmath107 .",
    "it is not possible to completely delete an intercity connection .",
    "figure [ sim ] shows that with no traffic restrictions all cities go to 100% infection rate while both the optimal solution and local heuristic force the virus to die out .",
    "the heuristic solution incurs a higher total cost but also forces the epidemic to die out faster .",
    "figure [ net ] shows the network of cities and the traffic restrictions on the edges .",
    "points representing cities are scaled proportional to their populations @xmath35 .",
    "edges are scaled proportional to the the unrestricted traffic @xmath108 .",
    "the color of each edge is linearly scaled from green ( @xmath109 ) to red ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "it significant to note that despite the local approach , the restrictions imposed are very similar to the optimal case .",
    "more traffic restrictions are required by the heuristic solution , however there is a strong correlation between which edges are restricted by the heuristic solution and by the optimal solution . ]",
    "we have proposed a convex framework to contain the propagation of an epidemic outbreak in a metapopulation model by controlling the traffic between subpopulations . in this context , controlling the spread of an epidemic outbreak can be written as a spectral condition involving the eigenvalues of a matrix that depends on the network structure and the parameters of the model . based on our spectral condition",
