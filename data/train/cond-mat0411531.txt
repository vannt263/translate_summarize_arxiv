    "the performance of @xmath2 superconducting materials@xcite can be greatly enhanced by the addition of small amounts of carbon that will raise the upper critical magnetic field , @xmath0,@xcite and the critical current density , @xmath7.@xcite point defects like carbon that substitute for boron in the host lattice have been shown to raise @xmath16 from @xmath17 in pure @xmath2 to @xmath18 for a carbon level of @xmath19.@xcite at higher carbon contents , @xmath20 rises more slowly and eventually drops to about @xmath21 at @xmath22 carbon.@xcite several different precipitate phases have been used to form small pinning sites in the @xmath2 lattice . for example , @xmath23,@xcite @xmath24,@xcite , @xmath6@xcite and @xmath25@xcite have been added and show a rise of @xmath7 into the range of @xmath26 at @xmath27 and self field with about @xmath28 precipitate additions . in many of these experiments , either a powder - in - tube @xmath29 process or a pressed and sintered pellet method have been used to form the precipitates for the synthesis .    in a different approach to sample preparation , a chemical vapor deposition , @xmath30 , method@xcite can be used to co - deposit @xmath8 together with a doping element to form long lengths of carbon doped boron fiber.@xcite subsequent heat treatment in @xmath11 vapor transforms the doped boron into doped @xmath2.@xcite both the @xmath30 and powder methods have advantages .",
    "the advantage of powder methods is that the diffusion lengths are comparable to the powder size giving relatively low reaction temperatures and short reaction times .",
    "the advantage of co - depositing the impurity with the @xmath8 in a @xmath30 process is that the impurity is mixed with the @xmath8 on an atomic scale .",
    "both @xmath3@xcite and @xmath4@xcite separately have been successfully doped into @xmath2 using these @xmath30 methods .",
    "the purpose of the work reported here is to study the combined @xmath4 and @xmath3 doping of @xmath2 to determine whether samples can be prepared with the combined benefits of both dopants , raising @xmath31 to the range of @xmath32 and raising @xmath7 values to the range of @xmath33 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "two specific questions need to be addressed .",
    "does the addition of @xmath3 to the @xmath4-doped @xmath2 samples reported earlier,@xcite reduce the amount of @xmath4 in the @xmath2 lattice , possibly by forming @xmath36 precipitates ? in the presence of @xmath4 , can the @xmath3 precipitate size be maintained at @xmath37 for high @xmath7 performance ?",
    "long lengths of doped boron fiber are prepared in a @xmath30 apparatus similar to that used for commercial boron filament production.@xcite all of the materials reported here were deposited on a @xmath38 fiber with an initial diameter of about @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath38 enters the reaction chamber moving at a few @xmath40 through a @xmath41 seal into a long glass tube containing flowing @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . for @xmath3 doping",
    ", @xmath42 is bubbled through liquid @xmath45 to provide @xmath45 molecules in the gas stream .",
    "typically the @xmath43 flow rate was @xmath46 with the @xmath44 and @xmath45 flow rates adjusted for the desired doping levels .",
    "the diameter of the exiting doped @xmath8 fibers were in the @xmath47 to @xmath48 range .",
    "the doped @xmath8 fibers were cut to lengths of @xmath49 and placed in a @xmath50 tube with a @xmath11 to @xmath8 ratio of @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath50 was welded shut , sealed in a quartz tube , and heat treated in a box furnace for appropriate periods . upon removal from the furnace",
    ", ampoules were quenched in water .",
    "resistivity measurements are made by a four contact method using silver epoxy to make the electrical contacts .",
    "a quantum design @xmath52 system was used to make resistivity vs temperature , @xmath53 , measurements up to @xmath54 . at higher fields ,",
    "@xmath55 measurements are made in a @xmath56 copper coil magnet at the national high magnetic field laboratory at florida state university .",
    "magnetization measurements were made in a quantum design squid magnetometer with a magnetic field range of @xmath57 and @xmath7 was determined from the magnetization hysteresis using the bean model for cylindrical shell samples.@xcite a philips cm30 transmission electron microscope ( @xmath58 ) was employed for the microstructure characterization .",
    "samples for the @xmath58 were made using a crush - flow technique .",
    "in an earlier publication,@xcite we investigated a series of @xmath3-doped @xmath2 samples that were deposited on a commercial carbon coated @xmath23 fiber substrate with a diameter of approximately @xmath59 instead of the @xmath60 diameter @xmath38 substrate used here .",
    "the doped-@xmath2 layers ranged from about @xmath61 to @xmath62 thick .",
    "flux pinning was excellent and gave @xmath7 over @xmath63 at @xmath64 and @xmath65 for a sample with an average doping of about @xmath66.@xcite unfortunately , there were problems with this approach to sample preparation .",
    "first , the diffusion of @xmath11 into the @xmath8 caused swelling and the @xmath2 pulled away from the substrate .",
    "second , the presence of a carbon coated substrate made the amount of @xmath4 in the specimen uncertain .",
    "in addition , these samples had a rather inhomogeneous @xmath3 distribution .",
    "there was a high @xmath3 level near the @xmath23 core and near the outer surface of the fiber.@xcite transmission electron microscope @xmath67 observations for one of these samples that had been reacted for @xmath68 at @xmath69 are shown in fig .",
    "results reveal a random distribution of precipitates scattered through the grain , ranging in size from @xmath70 to @xmath71 with a spacing about 5 times as large .",
    "energy dispersive spectroscopy for a large portion of the grain in fig .",
    "1a , revealed that the @xmath72 ratio was @xmath73 .",
    "selected area diffraction taken along the c - axis showed the prominent hexagonal pattern of @xmath2 with additional powder pattern rings arising from the titanium boride precipitates .",
    "the beam was then tipped off axis to show the rings more prominently .",
    "indexing the rings revealed that the precipitates were @xmath5 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "these results differ from those found by zhao and coworkers.@xcite they found that samples prepared by mixing powders of @xmath11 , @xmath3 , and @xmath8 and reacting gave @xmath6 precipitates on the @xmath2 grain boundaries .",
    "this illustrates that different sample preparation methods can yield different types and locations of the precipitates .",
    "both the precipitation of @xmath5 throughout the grains@xcite and precipitation of @xmath6 on the grain boundaries@xcite seem to give enhanced flux pinning .",
    "samples with @xmath60 diameter tungsten cores were prepared using three different @xmath45 flow rates in the @xmath30 reactor , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "after the @xmath30 deposition , the fibers were reacted in @xmath11 vapor to form @xmath3-doped @xmath2 .",
    "energy dispersive spectra ( eds ) in a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) was used to probe the uniformity of @xmath3 distribution across the superconducting fiber and to measure the @xmath3 to @xmath11 ratio , @xmath77/[ti+mg]$ ] .",
    "line scans in various regions of the sample show that the @xmath3 level was uniform to about @xmath78 of the average value .",
    "multiple point scans and area scans in the eds give average values of the @xmath77/[ti+mg]$ ] ratio , shown in fig .",
    "2 indicating that the percent @xmath3 is roughly linearly related to the flow rate in the reaction chamber .",
    "point scans , line scans , and large area raster scans were used for analysis . the large area raster scan shown by the open squares on fig .",
    "2 comprises the most data and are probably the most accurate measure of the @xmath3 content .",
    "these three flow rates of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , give @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively for the @xmath77/[ti+mg]$ ] ratio .    because these @xmath3 doped samples were deposited on a @xmath60 diameter @xmath38 wire and had a @xmath82 outer diameter , these fibers require much longer times or higher temperatures to fully form the @xmath2 phase than the @xmath83 to @xmath62 @xmath8 layers of the earlier work.@xcite therefore , temperatures of @xmath84 to @xmath85 were often used .",
    "a sample with @xmath86 reacted for @xmath87 at @xmath88 were found to be @xmath89 reacted using polarized light in an optical microscope .",
    "a @xmath58 micrograph of this sample , fig .",
    "1b , shows precipitates that are much larger than in fig .",
    "in this figure , the sweeping shaded areas arise from the underlying holey carbon support . in this micrograph",
    ", the beam has been tilted to emphasize areas of dense dislocations as shown , for example , in the top center of the micrograph .",
    "many of the precipitates were @xmath90 to @xmath91 in diameter .",
    "selected area diffraction indicated the precipitates were @xmath6 and had c - axes coaxial with the @xmath2 grains in which they were imbedded . for a sample with @xmath86 plus @xmath92 ,",
    "the sample was fully reacted after @xmath93 at @xmath85 and shows the @xmath94 to @xmath95 diameter precipitates of fig .",
    "the large precipitates here are @xmath6 with the c - axis parallel to the c - axis of the @xmath2 grain in which it is imbedded .",
    "another series of samples having @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath96 were all reacted at @xmath97 for @xmath93 and studied in the @xmath58 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the precipitate size is less than @xmath99 and widely spaced . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the precipitate size ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath100 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the precipitate size ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 and the density of precipitates is correspondingly higher .",
    "all of these samples show @xmath7 values higher than pure @xmath8 , but lower than shown by the sample of fig .",
    "magnetization data , shown in fig .",
    "3 , indicate that the suppression of @xmath102 with @xmath3 doping depends on the temperature at which the @xmath2 forms .",
    "samples reacted at @xmath103 for @xmath87 have magnetization curves similar to pure @xmath2 except that they are shifted to lower temperature by about @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath105 and @xmath106 are nearly identical whereas the @xmath107 sample is a bit lower .",
    "the depression is not monotonic in @xmath3 content , and the results on fig .",
    "3 probably represent true scatter in the data .",
    "the cause of the suppression in @xmath102 is not understood .",
    "if the @xmath3 all precipitates as @xmath5 or @xmath6 and no @xmath3 is incorporated in the @xmath2 lattice , then it might be expected that the suppression of @xmath102 might be rather small and arise from lattice strains induced by the precipitates or other defects in the @xmath2 .",
    "it is also possible that some @xmath3 atoms replace @xmath11 in the @xmath2 lattice and reduce the superconducting interaction in that way .",
    "further study is going to be needed to determine which variables contribute to this suppression in @xmath102 .",
    "at @xmath97 for @xmath93 , the suppression of @xmath102 behavior in fig .",
    "3b is similar to fig .",
    "3a except that the downward shift of @xmath102 is somewhat larger . at @xmath108 for @xmath109 , shown in fig .",
    "3c , the suppression of @xmath102 is very large and increases monotonically with @xmath3 content .",
    "because the @xmath110 curves are not always monotonic in the @xmath3 content , a new series of samples were made at @xmath97 to check reproducibility .",
    "the data for the two sets of samples with the same @xmath3 content differed by as much as @xmath111 . with these large @xmath6",
    "precipitates , there are some as yet uncontrolled parameters .",
    "an x - ray study of the shift in the @xmath2 a - axis lattice constant was undertaken to look for a connection between the lattice constant an the amount of impurity .",
    "for the case of carbon,@xcite the a - axis lattice constant contracts linearly with increasing @xmath4 , as shown by fig .",
    "4 , while the c - axis remains essentially unchanged as reported by several authors.@xcite for the case of @xmath3 , the picture is more complicated . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the a - axis contracts with increasing @xmath3 , but there is considerable scatter in the data and the amount of change in the a - axis may depend on the temperature at which the @xmath2 is formed . an additional sample with @xmath112 flow rate of @xmath45 ( @xmath113 ) and reacted at @xmath85 for @xmath114 is shown by the open square of fig .",
    "the apparent flat region of the a - axis lattice parameter between @xmath115 and @xmath116 as shown by the open squares would appear to indicate that a solubility limit has been reached for @xmath3 in @xmath2 at about @xmath117 .",
    "for the case of @xmath3 additions only , samples with an @xmath118 for @xmath93 reaction temperature are used to illustrate the changes in superconducting properties .",
    "the values of @xmath0 measured up to @xmath119 for the three different @xmath3 concentrations are slightly lower than for pure @xmath2 as shown on fig .",
    "5 . as was found for values of @xmath110 curves in fig .",
    "3b , the @xmath117 sample has the largest suppression of @xmath102 and the largest suppression of @xmath0 .    as shown by fig .",
    "6 , the @xmath7 values at @xmath34 for these three @xmath3 concentrations are enhanced by about a factor of @xmath120 at fields , up to about @xmath121 .",
    "there is very little difference in @xmath7 as the @xmath3 level is raised from @xmath105 to about @xmath122 .",
    "values of @xmath7 drop through @xmath123 at about @xmath121 even though @xmath20 is above @xmath124 at @xmath34 for these three samples as shown in fig . 5 .",
    "all the samples reported here for the combined doping were reacted at @xmath85 to ensure full conversion to the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the @xmath4 content is determined from the @xmath44 flow rate in the @xmath30 chamber and previous results.@xcite for a sample with @xmath86 plus @xmath92 shown in fig .",
    "1c , the precipitates are @xmath94 to @xmath95 in diameter and selected area diffraction shows the precipitates to be @xmath6 with the c - axis parallel to the c - axis of the @xmath2 grain in which they are imbedded . in this micrograph , the beam is tilted so that the dislocations are not so apparent , but they are there .",
    "these precipitates of fig .",
    "1c are similar to those in fig . 1b , but in contrast to the @xmath5 precipitates of fig .",
    "an x - ray analysis of the combined @xmath3 and @xmath4 doping is illustrated in fig .",
    "the c - axis lattice parameter from the ( 002 ) peak essentially does not change with @xmath3 and @xmath4 addition .",
    "the a - axis lattice parameter contracts in a regular way as shown by the ( 110 ) peak of fig .",
    "the @xmath117-only peak moves to higher angle than the pure @xmath2 peak by about @xmath125 degree as shown by the heavy dotted line .",
    "the @xmath126-only peak shifts out from the pure @xmath2 peak by about @xmath127 degree as shown by the light dotted line . and , the @xmath117+@xmath126 peak shifts out from the pure @xmath2 peak by about @xmath128 degree as shown by the heavy solid line .",
    "roughly speaking , the decrease in a - axis lattice parameter is additive for @xmath3 and @xmath4 doping at this level .",
    "as was reported earlier,@xcite the @xmath110 curves and the resulting @xmath102 values are depressed monotonically with increasing @xmath4 content as shown by the open squares and solid circles of fig .",
    "if an additional @xmath117 is added to each of these @xmath4 concentrations , the combined suppression of @xmath102 is roughly additive . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the addition of @xmath129 to @xmath2 suppressed @xmath102 by about @xmath130 and the addition of @xmath129 plus @xmath107 suppressed @xmath102 by about @xmath131 .",
    "values of @xmath20 in samples with the combined doping shown in fig .",
    "9 by the open circles are very similar to values for @xmath4 doping only reported previously@xcite as shown by the solid symbols .",
    "the solid triangles were taken with @xmath132 measurements and the solid circles were taken at the national high magnetic field laboratory as @xmath133 measurements .",
    "for the combined @xmath3 and @xmath4 doped samples there was considerable rounding at the high field end of the @xmath133 transitions .",
    "the two open circles represent two different definitions of @xmath31 , the lower being a linear extrapolation of the long linear region of @xmath133 up to the normal state , and the upper open circle being the field where the resistivity reaches the normal state value within the noise .",
    "the addition of a few percent @xmath4 to the @xmath3 doped samples substantially raises @xmath31 ( open circles ) to values comparable to values for carbon only ( solid symbols ) .",
    "values of @xmath7 for a series of samples reacted at @xmath134 are shown in fig . 10 .",
    "for the combined @xmath126 + @xmath117 sample at @xmath14 , the @xmath7 curve crosses @xmath123 at about @xmath135 shown by the solid circles .",
    "the @xmath136 + @xmath137 sample at @xmath14 crosses @xmath123 at @xmath138 , as shown by the open circles .",
    "the @xmath86 only sample has the highest low field @xmath7 values and crosses @xmath123 at @xmath139 . a pure @xmath2 sample at measured at @xmath14 is shown by the solid squares .",
    "it is not shown here , but the the combined @xmath126 + @xmath117 sample at @xmath34 , the @xmath7 curve crosses @xmath123 at about @xmath121 .    to summarize , the addition of @xmath4 to raise @xmath0 and the addition of @xmath3 to form precipitate pinning centers are roughly independent of one another for the samples reported here .",
    "carbon doped @xmath2 shows a rapid rise in @xmath16 from @xmath17 for pure @xmath2 to @xmath21 for @xmath140 added carbon . with both @xmath141 @xmath4 and @xmath142 the sample retains a @xmath143 of @xmath144 and no evidence for the formation of @xmath36 was seen .",
    "the addition of @xmath3 enhances @xmath7 substantially in the magnetic field range of @xmath145 to @xmath146 , as shown in fig .",
    "much work needs to be done to optimize the the @xmath4 and @xmath3 levels and the processing to raise @xmath7 at high fields . for low reaction temperatures and short times to form the @xmath2 phase ,",
    "@xmath58 data show that the precipitates are intra - granular and randomly oriented particles ranging in size from @xmath147 to @xmath71 . for higher reaction temperatures in the range from @xmath84 to @xmath134 ,",
    "the precipitates are much larger .",
    "the precipitates are usually intra - granular @xmath6 particles coplanar with the @xmath2 host that range from @xmath99 to @xmath91 in size .",
    "coarsening of the @xmath6 precipitates at high temperatures and long times is clearly a problem . in magnetic fields from zero to @xmath148",
    ", the addition of carbon to @xmath3-doped @xmath2 gives relatively little change in @xmath7 , but in the @xmath149 to @xmath150 range , carbon additions clearly enhance @xmath7 .",
    "a very practical problem is that the addition of either @xmath4 or @xmath3 slows down the rate at which the @xmath8 fibers transform to the @xmath2 phase . for high @xmath7 values",
    ", it is helpful to react at low temperatures to give small @xmath2 grains and to prevent the @xmath3 precipitate coarsening .",
    "some method is needed to overcome these slow reaction rates , probably the use of fine powders to keep the reaction time short and the reaction temperatures low .",
