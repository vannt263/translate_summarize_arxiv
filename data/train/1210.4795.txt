    "while this result is interesting since the expression for the secrecy capacity is valid for all snr scenarios , there still exists no computable secrecy capacity expression for the mimo gaussian wiretap channel under an average total power constraint .    in this paper , we first investigate the rank property of the optimal input covariance matrix that achieves the secrecy capacity of the general gaussian multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) wiretap channel under the average total power constraint , where the number of antennas is arbitrary for both the transmitter and the two receivers .",
