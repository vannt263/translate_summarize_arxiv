    "it has been a long standing problem that one is forced to reduce the strength of the folding potential by a factor @xmath5 in order to reproduce the elastic scattering data  @xcite for loosely bound projectiles such as @xmath1li and @xmath6be within the optical model approach with a folding potential .",
    "this problem has been ascribed to the strong breakup character of the projectiles ; studies have been made of the effects of the breakup on the elastic scattering , based on the coupled discretized continuum channel ( cdcc ) method  @xcite .",
    "these studies were very successful in reproducing the elastic scattering data without introducing any arbitrary normalization factor and furthermore in understanding the physical origin of the factor @xmath5 needed to be introduced in one - channel optical model calculations .",
    "the authors of refs .  @xcite projected their coupled channel equations to a single elastic channel equation and deduced the polarization potential arising from the coupling with the breakup channels .",
    "the resultant real part of the polarization potential was then found to be repulsive at the surface region around the strong absorption radius , @xmath7 .",
    "this shows that the reduction of the folding potential by a factor of @xmath5 is to effectively take into account the effects of this repulsive coupling with the breakup channels .    in our recent study  @xcite",
    ", we explored this problem for the @xmath8li + @xmath2pb system in the framework of the extended optical model  @xcite , in which the optical potential consists of the energy independent hartree - fock part and the energy dependent complex polarization potential having two components , i.e. , the direct reaction ( dr ) and fusion parts , which we call the dr and fusion potentials , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using such an extended optical potential , we performed the simultaneous @xmath0 analyses of the elastic scattering and fusion cross section data , determining the two components of the polarization potentials as functions of the incident energy .",
    "our expectation was that the resulting real part of the dr potential would become repulsive consistently with the results of the cdcc calculations .",
    "indeed the real dr polarization potential turned out to be repulsive .",
    "in addition , it was shown that both the dr and fusion potentials satisfy the dispersion relation  @xcite separately .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath3li+@xmath2pb system . in this system , such a normalization anomaly as observed in @xmath1li+@xmath2pb does not appear around the coulomb - barrier energies ; the normalization factor @xmath9 necessary for reproducing the data is close to unity , @xmath10 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in contrast to the factor @xmath5 for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb .    in sec .",
    "ii of this article , we first discuss some characteristic features of elastic scattering cross section data of @xmath3li+@xmath2pb  @xcite in comparison with those of @xmath1li+@xmath2pb .",
    "it will be shown in the comparison that the dr cross section for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb is expected to be significantly smaller than that for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb . in sec .",

    "v , a comparison is made of the present results with those obtained from the cdcc calculations  @xcite and a previous study  @xcite based on the conventional optical model with a double folding potential .",
    "we also show a comparison of the present result with the analysis previously made by us  @xcite for the @xmath1li+@xmath2pb system . section vi concludes the paper .",
    "we begin with the discussion of some of the characteristic features of the elastic scattering cross sections @xmath13 data for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb in comparison with those for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb .",
    "such features can best be seen in the ratio , @xmath14 , defined by @xmath15 as a function of the distance of the closest approach @xmath16 ( or the reduced distance @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 is the coulomb scattering cross section , while @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is related to the scattering angle @xmath19 by @xmath20\\ ] ] with @xmath21 @xmath22 being the distance of the closest approach in a head - on collision . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass and charge of the projectile and target ions , respectively , and @xmath25 is the incident energy in the center - of - mass system . @xmath14 as defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) will be referred to as the elastic probability .    in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , we present the experimental values of @xmath14 for incident energies around the coulomb barrier energy as a function of the reduced distance @xmath17 for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb and @xmath1li+@xmath2pb , respectively .",
    "as seen , the values of @xmath14 at different energies line up to form a very narrow band .",
    "this is a characteristic feature seen in many of the heavy - ion collisions , reflecting the semiclassical nature of these collisions .",
    "@xmath14 remains close to unity until two ions approach each other within a distance @xmath26 , where @xmath14 begins to fall off .",
    "the distance @xmath26 is usually called the interaction distance , at which the nuclear interactions between the colliding ions are switched on , so to speak .",
    "the values of @xmath26 are about 1.9  fm for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb and 1.8  fm for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb .    as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fall off of the @xmath14 values in the region immediately next to @xmath26 is due to dr .",
    "the fact that the @xmath26-value ( 1.9  fm ) for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb is larger than the @xmath27  fm ) for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb shows dr starts to take place at larger distances for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb than it does for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb .",
    "also , it can be seen that the amount of decrease of the @xmath14 value from unity in @xmath1li+@xmath2pb is significantly larger than in @xmath3li+@xmath2pb at @xmath28  fm @xmath29  fm , where dr takes place .",
    "these features clearly indicate that dr ( which may be dominated by breakup ) takes place significantly stronger in @xmath1li+@xmath2pb than in @xmath3li+@xmath2pb .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be seen in the next section from the semi - experimental dr cross section to be extracted .",
    "finally , we note that in the region of @xmath30  fm where fusion dominates , the values of @xmath14 for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb and @xmath1li+@xmath2pb are almost identical .",
    "for our purpose of determining the fusion and dr potentials separately , it is desirable to have the data of the dr cross section in addition to the fusion and elastic scattering cross sections . for the @xmath3li+@xmath2pb system , however , no reliable data of the dr cross sections are available , although considerable efforts have been devoted to measure the breakup and incomplete fusion cross sections  @xcite . here",
    ", we thus generate the so - called semi - experimental dr cross section @xmath11 , following the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our method to generate @xmath11 resorts to the well known empirical fact that the total reaction cross section @xmath31 calculated from the optical model fit to the available elastic scattering cross section data , @xmath32 , usually agrees well with the experimental @xmath33 , in spite of the ambiguities in the optical potential .",
    "let us call @xmath33 thus generated the semi - experimental reaction cross section @xmath34 .",

    "i , @xmath36 data are not available @xmath3li+@xmath2pb , and thus we use the @xmath37 data taken for @xmath3li+@xmath12bi  @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we first carry out rather simple optical model @xmath0 analyses of elastic scattering data solely for the purpose of deducing @xmath31 and @xmath34 . for these preliminary analyses",
    ", we assume the optical potential to be sum of @xmath38+@xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath38 is the real , energy independent bare folding potential to be discussed later in sec .",
    "b , @xmath39 is an energy independent short range imaginary potential to be discussed in sec .",
    "a , and @xmath40 is a woods - saxon type complex potential with common geometrical parameters for both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the elastic scattering data are then fitted with a fixed radius parameter @xmath41 for @xmath40 , treating , however , all three other parameters , the real and the imaginary strengths @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the diffuseness parameter @xmath44 , as adjustable . the @xmath0 fitting",
    "is done for three choices of the radius parameter ; @xmath41=1.3 , 1.4 , and 1.5 fm .",
    "these different choices of the @xmath41-value are made in order to examine the dependence of the resulting @xmath34 on the value of @xmath45 .    as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the values of @xmath34 thus extracted for three different @xmath41-values agree with the average value of @xmath34 within 2% , implying that @xmath34 is determined without much ambiguity .",

    "it is noticeable that the two sets of @xmath34 determined independently agree within 1% .",
    "we can also see that the values of @xmath11 thus deduced are smaller than those for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb  @xcite by a factor of 1.23 @xmath46 1.72 as anticipated from the @xmath47 values discussed in the previous section .",

    "d , the real and imaginary parts of both dr and fusion polarization potentials determined from the present @xmath0 analyses satisfy the dispersion relation  @xcite separately .",
    "furthermore , the fusion potential exhibits the threshold anomaly as observed in heavy ion collisions involving tightly bound projectiles  @xcite . for the @xmath1li+@xmath2pb system",
    "studied earlier  @xcite similar threshold anomaly for the fusion potential and the dispersion relation were observed .",
    "it is remarkable that the real part of the dr potential , which we denote here by @xmath48 , turns out to be repulsive at most of the energies considered ; only exceptions appear at the lowest energy point of @xmath49=28.1  mev , where @xmath48 becomes very weakly attractive ( see fig .  3 ) .",

    "( [ e - w_d ] ) is repulsive above @xmath51 29 mev , but becomes attractive between @xmath52 19 mev and 29 mev .",
    "we remark that the repulsiveness of @xmath48 for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb is considerably weaker than that for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb  @xcite , which is consistent with the results drawn from the cdcc study made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the polarization potentials due to the coupling to the breakup channels are calculated for both @xmath1li+@xmath2pb and @xmath3li+@xmath2pb .",
    "it is also remarkable that the polarization potential in the surface region , say at the strong absorption radius of @xmath53  fm , are dominated by the dr part of the potential as shown in fig .",
    "[ imaginary ] .",
    "( note that fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] shows only the potential strength parameters , not the potential values . )",
    "the same was true for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb in ref .",
    "let us take as an example the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "then the contribution to the total imaginary part of the potential from the fusion part is less than 6% and 15% for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb and @xmath1li+@xmath2pb systems , respectively .",
    "therefore , the total polarization potential in the surface region is mainly characterized by the dr potential .",
    "it is then interesting to compare the values of the total imaginary potential at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0 analyses of the elastic scattering data of both @xmath1li+@xmath2pb and @xmath3li+@xmath2pb were carried out by using double folding potentials as a real potential and a woods - saxon type as an imaginary potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite the overall normalization constant @xmath9 of the double folding potential and all three parameters ( the strength , radius , and diffuseness parameters ) of the imaginary potential were treated as adjustable parameters .",
    "an important conclusion drawn from the analyses was that the resultant potentials at the surface exhibit the threshold anomaly for @xmath3li but not for @xmath1li .    in fig .",
    "[ potential ] , presented are values of @xmath56 , at @xmath57  fm obtained directly from the @xmath0 analyses ( not those of the dispersive potential such as given by eqs .",

    "@xcite are multiplied by factors 1.23 and 1.11 for @xmath3li and @xmath1li , respectively , for comparison .",
    "figure  [ potential ] shows that the two sets of the values are very close to each other , demonstrating clearly that the energy dependence of the @xmath58 values determined in both cases are essentially the same .",
    "combined with the above mentioned fact that the @xmath58 values determined in the present study and in ref .",
    "@xcite are essentially those of the dr potential , it follows that the energy dependence seen in the @xmath58 values of ref .",
    "@xcite is that of dr . in this sense ,",
    "the threshold anomaly claimed to be seen in ref .",

    "use is made of the double folding potential as a bare potential .",
    "it is found that the experimental elastic scattering and fusion data are well reproduced without introducing any normalization factor for the double folding potential and also that both dr and fusion parts of the polarization potential determined from the @xmath0 analyses satisfy separately the dispersion relation .",
    "moreover , we find that the real part of the fusion portion of the polarization potential is attractive while that of the dr part is repulsive except at energies far below the coulomb barrier energy",
    ". the repulsive real part of the dr potential is , however , considerably smaller than that for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb obtained earlier  @xcite , reflecting the fact that the dr ( breakup ) cross section for @xmath3li+@xmath2pb is smaller than that for @xmath1li+@xmath2pb .",
