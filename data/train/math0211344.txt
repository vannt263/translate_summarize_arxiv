    "radii ( of various types ) belong to the most important functionals of polytopes and general convex bodies in euclidean space @xmath0 @xcite , and they are related to applications in computer vision , robotics , computational biology , functional analysis , and statistics ( see @xcite ) . following the notation in @xcite , the _",
    "outer @xmath4-radius _ @xmath5 of a convex body @xmath6 is the radius of a smallest enclosing @xmath4-dimensional sphere in the optimal orthogonal projection of @xmath7 onto a @xmath4-dimensional linear subspace . studying these radii , mainly for regular simplices and regular polytopes ,",
    "is a classical topic of convex geometry ( see @xcite ) .    from the computational point of view , most of the existing algorithms for computing these radii focus on approximation  @xcite .",
    "a major reason is that exact computations lead to algebraic problems of high degree , even for computing , say , the outer @xmath8-radius in @xmath0 ( already if @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , since some approaches for computing radii of general polytopes consider the computation of a smallest enclosing cylinder of a simplex as a black box within a larger computation @xcite , these core problems on simplices are of fundamental importance .",
    "recently , the authors of  @xcite demonstrated that using their state - of - the - art numerical polynomial solvers , various problems related to cylinders in @xmath2 can be solved rather efficiently .",
    "in particular , the authors give a polynomial formulation for the smallest circumscribing cylinder of a simplex in @xmath2 , whose bzout number  the product of the degrees of the polynomial equations  is 60 .",
    "however , these equations contain certain undesired solutions with multiplicity  4 , and as a result of these multiplicities the computation times ( using state - of - the - art numerical techniques ) are about a factor 100 larger than those of similar problems in which all solutions occur with multiplicity  1 .    here",
    ", we provide a general algebraic framework for computing smallest enclosing and circumscribing cylinders of simplices in @xmath0 .",
    "first we reduce the computation of a smallest enclosing cylinder in @xmath2 to the computation of a smallest circumscribing cylinder , thus combining these two problems .",
    "then we investigate smallest circumscribing cylinders of simplices in @xmath2 .",
    "we improve the results of  @xcite by providing a polynomial formulation for the locally extreme cylinders , whose bzout bound is 36 and whose solutions generically have multiplicity one .",
    "our formulations use techniques from the paper @xcite which studies the lines simultaneously tangent to four unit spheres .",
    "these techniques also enable us to present classes of simplices for which the algebraic degrees in computing the smallest circumscribing cylinder can be considerably reduced .",
    "then , in section  [ se : radiindim ] , we give a generalization of our approach to smallest circumscribing cylinders of a simplex in @xmath0 .",
    "based on this formulation we give bounds on the number of locally extreme cylinders based on the bzout number . since",
    "this bound is not tight , we provide better bounds for small dimensions ; these bounds are based on mixed volume computations and bernstein s theorem .",
    "moreover , we study in detail the locally extreme circumscribing cylinders of a regular simplex in @xmath0 . to exploit many symmetries in the analysis",
    ", we provide a formulation based on symmetric polynomials . using elementary invariant theory",
    "we show that the direction vector of every locally extreme circumscribing cylinder has at most three distinct values in its components . with this result",
    "we can illustrate our combinatorial results on the number of solutions for general simplices .    as a byproduct of our computational studies , we discovered a subtle but severe mistake in the paper  @xcite on the explicit determination of the outer @xmath8-radius for a regular simplex in @xmath0 , thus completely invalidating the proof given there . in the appendix",
    "we give a description of that flaw , including some computer - algebraic calculations illustrating it .",
    "throughout the paper we work in euclidean space @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath10 with the usual scalar product @xmath11 and norm @xmath12 .",
    "we write @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath4-flat _ is an affine subspace of dimension @xmath4 . for a convex polytope @xmath15 ( or a finite point set @xmath15 ) and a @xmath4-flat @xmath16 , we consider @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the euclidean distance from @xmath19 to @xmath16 .",
    "the _ outer @xmath4-radius _ of @xmath20 is @xmath21    the choice of the indexing in the @xmath4-radius stems from the fact that it measures the radius of an enclosing @xmath4-dimensional sphere in the optimal orthogonal projection of @xmath20 onto a @xmath4-dimensional linear subspace ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most natural representatives of this class is the one with @xmath22 , @xmath9 , i.e. , the smallest enclosing ( circular ) cylinder of a polytope . in @xmath0 , we define a cylinder to be a set of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a line in @xmath0 , @xmath25 denotes the unit ball , @xmath26 , the addition denotes the minkowski sum , and @xmath27 denotes the boundary of a set .",
    "we say that @xmath28 _ can be enclosed _ in a cylinder @xmath7 if @xmath28 is contained in the convex hull of @xmath7 .",
    "thus the outer @xmath8-radius gives the radius of the smallest enclosing cylinder of a polytope .",
    "a simplex in @xmath0 is the convex hull of @xmath29 affinely independent points .",

    "namely , it suffices to compute the smallest circumscribing cylinder ( corresponding to case ( i ) ) as well as the smallest enclosing cylinders whose axes satisfies one of the condition in ( ii ) ; the latter case gives a constant number of problems of smaller algebraic degree ( since the positions of the axes are very restricted ) .",
    "before we start with the proof , we remark that theorem [ th : smallestenclosing ] and its different cases show a quite similar behaviour as the well known statement that the ( unique ) circumsphere of a simplex touches all its vertices , or one of its great @xmath8-circles is the circumsphere of one of the @xmath8-faces of the simplex ( see @xcite ) .    in the proof we will apply the following geometric equivalence .",
    "a point @xmath35 is enclosed in a cylinder with axis @xmath24 if and only if @xmath24 is a transversal of the sphere with radius @xmath32 centered at @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath24 is a line intersecting the sphere ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be a cylinder with axis @xmath24 and radius @xmath32 enclosing @xmath20 .",
    "then , denoting by @xmath37 the sphere with radius @xmath32 centered at @xmath38 , @xmath24 is a common transversal to @xmath39 . by continuously translating and rotating @xmath40",
    ", we can assume that @xmath24 is tangent to two of the spheres , say @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "further , by changing coordinates , we can assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 have the form @xmath43 , @xmath44 for some @xmath45 .",
    "the set of lines tangent to two spheres of radius @xmath32 constitutes a set of hyperboloids ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , any of these hyperboloids touches the sphere @xmath41 on a circle lying in a hyperplane parallel to the @xmath46-plane .",
    "hence , the set of hyperboloids can be parametrized by the @xmath36-coordinate of this hyperplane which we denote by @xmath47 .    if @xmath48 then the boundary values are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these two extreme situations yield a cylinder and a double cone with apex @xmath51 , respectively ( see figure  [ fi : cylindercone ] ) . for @xmath52 we obtain a hyperboloid of one sheet ( see figure  [ fi : hyperboloid1](a ) ) .    if @xmath53 then the boundary values are @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here , for @xmath56 we obtain hyperboloids of one sheet , too . for @xmath55",
    "the hyperboloid degenerates to a set of tangents which are tangents to the circle with radius @xmath57 in the hyperplane @xmath58 ( see figure  [ fi : hyperboloid1](b ) ) .",
    "let @xmath59 be the parameter value of the hyperboloid containing the line @xmath24 .",
    "the tangent to @xmath41 and @xmath42 is contained in the hyperboloid with some parameter value @xmath59 . by decreasing the parameter @xmath47 starting from @xmath59 the hyperboloid changes its shape towards the cylinder around @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the infimum of all @xmath61 such that the hyperboloid does not contain a generating line tangent to some other sphere @xmath62 for some @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 , then by choosing any point of @xmath20 not collinear to @xmath65 and @xmath66 we are in case ( ii ) ( a ) .",
    "if @xmath67 then let @xmath68 be the corresponding point .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the set of lines simultaneously tangent to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath70 .",
    "now let @xmath71 be the infimum of all @xmath61 such that there exists a continuous function @xmath72 with @xmath73 lying on the hyperboloid with parameter @xmath47 . since the spheres are compact , the infimum is a minimum .",
    "if @xmath74 then one of three hyperboloids involved by the three pairs of spheres must be one of the extreme hyperboloids in that situation and we are in cases ( ii ) ( a ) , ( b ) , or ( c ) .",
    "if @xmath75 then we distinguish between two possibilities .",
    "either during this process we also reached a tangent to some other sphere @xmath76 for some @xmath77 ; in this case we are in case ( i ) . or during the transformation all the points @xmath78 are enclosed in the cylinder with axis @xmath24 and radius @xmath32 , but none of them is contained in it .",
    "then we arrive at situation ( ii ) ( a ) .",
    "so far , we have seen how to reduce the computation of a smallest enclosing cylinder of a simplex in @xmath2 to the computation of a smallest circumscribing cylinder . in order to apply algebraic methods to compute a smallest circumscribing cylinder , there are many different ways to formulate that problem in terms of polynomial equations .",
    "it is well - known that the computational costs of solving a system of polynomial equations are mainly dominated by the bzout number (= product of the degrees ) and the mixed volume ( the latter one is discussed in section  [ se : radiindim ] ) .",
    "see  @xcite for comprehensive introductions and the state - of - the - art .",
    "hence , it is an essential task to find the right formulations .",
    "moreover , we are interested in simplex classes for which the degrees can be further reduced .      in the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6 ) , a polynomial formulation is given to compute the smallest enclosing cylinder of a simplex in @xmath2 .",
    "this formulation describes the problem by three equations in the direction vector @xmath79 of the line , one of them normalizing the direction vector @xmath80 by @xmath81 the equations are of degree 10 , 3 , and 2 , respectively , thus giving a bzout number of 60 .",
    "however , as pointed out in that paper , some of the solutions to that system are artificially introduced by the formulation and occur with higher multiplicity , and there are only 18 really different solutions . even more severely , in the experiments in that paper ( using synaps , a state - of - the - art software for numerical polynomial computations ) , the numerical treatment of these multiple solutions needs much time , roughly a factor 100 compared to similar systems without multiple solutions .    here , we present an approach , which reflects the true algebraic bound of 18 .",
    "namely , we give a polynomial formulation with bzout bound 36 in which every solution generically has multiplicity one .",
    "the additional factor 2 just results from the fact that due to the normalization condition   every solution @xmath80 also implies that @xmath82 is a solution as well .",
    "our framework is based on  @xcite in which the lines simultaneously tangent to four unit spheres are studied . a line in @xmath2 is represented by a point @xmath83 lying on the line and a direction vector @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "we can make @xmath86 unique by requiring that @xmath87 .",
    "a line @xmath88 has euclidean distance @xmath32 from a point @xmath89 if and only if the quadratic equation @xmath90 has a solution of multiplicity two .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath91 expanding this equation yields @xmath92 rather than using @xmath85 to further simplify this equation , we prefer to keep the homogenous form , in which all terms are of degree  4 .",
    "now let @xmath93 be the affinely independent vertices of the given simplex .",
    "without loss of generality we can choose @xmath94 to be the located in the origin .",
    "then the remaining points span @xmath2 . subtracting the equation for the point in the origin from the equations for @xmath65 , @xmath66",
    ", @xmath68 gives the following program to compute the square of the radius of the minimal circumscribing cylinder .",
    "@xmath95 we remark that the set of admissible solutions is nonempty ; a proof of that statement ( for general dimension ) is contained in section  [ se : radiindim ] .",
    "since the points @xmath96 are linearly independent , the matrix @xmath97 is invertible , and we can solve the equations in the bottom line of   for  @xmath86 : @xmath98 now substitute this expression for @xmath86 into the the objective function and into the first constraint of the system  ( [ eq : origintransform ] ) . after setting @xmath85 in the denominator of the first constraint ,",
    "this gives a homogeneous cubic equation which we denote by @xmath99 .",

    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] note that the objective function is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 .",
    "we denote this polynomial by @xmath104 .    using lagrange multipliers",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 , a necessary local optimality condition is @xmath107 by thinking of an additional factor @xmath108 before @xmath109 and considering   as a system of linear equations in @xmath108 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , we see that if   is satisfied for some vector @xmath80 then the determinant @xmath110 vanishes .",
    "\\(a ) any direction vector @xmath111 of the axis of a locally extreme circumscribing cylinder satisfies the polynomial system  . if this system has only finitely many solutions then this number is bounded by  36 .",
    "\\(b ) for a generic simplex the number of solutions is indeed finite , and all solutions have multiplicity one .",
    "let @xmath80 be the direction vector of an axis of a locally extreme circumscribing cylinder .",
    "then @xmath80 satisfies the first constraint of  , and the determinant   vanishes .",
    "since these are homogeneous equations of degree  3 and 6 , respectively , bzout s theorem implies that in connection with @xmath112 we obtain at most 36 isolated solutions .    for the second statement",
    "it suffices to check that for one specific simplex there are only finitely many solutions and that all solutions are pairwise distinct .      in this section",
    ", we investigate conditions under which the degree of the resulting equations is reduced .",
    "moreover , we show that for the equifacial simplex , the minimal circumscribing radius can be computed quite easily .",
    "we use the following classification from @xcite .",
    "[ pr : charactreducible ] let @xmath113 be a simplex in @xmath2 with vertices @xmath93 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath114 in the cubic equation factors into a linear polynomial and an irreducible quadratic polynomial if and only if the four faces of @xmath113 can be partitioned into two pairs of faces @xmath115 , @xmath116 with @xmath117 . moreover , @xmath114 factors into three linear terms if and only if the areas of all four faces of @xmath113 are equal .",
    "first let us consider the case where @xmath114 decomposes into a linear polynomial and an irreducible quadratic polynomial . by optimizing separately over the linear and the quadratic constraint , the degrees of our equations are smaller than for the general case .",
    "namely , analogously to the derivation in section  [ su : generalsimplices ] , for the quadratic constraint we obtain a bzout bound of @xmath118 and for the linear constraint we obtain @xmath119 thus , we can conclude :    if the four faces of the simplex can be partitioned into two pairs of faces @xmath115 , @xmath120 with @xmath117 then there are at most 28 isolated local extrema for the mimimal circumscribing cylinder .",
    "they can be computed from two polynomial systems with bzout numbers 20 and 8 , respectively .",
    "* equifacial simplices . * a simplex in @xmath2",
    "is called _ equifacial _ if all four faces have the same area . by proposition  [ pr : charactreducible ] , for an equifacial simplex the cubic polynomial @xmath114 factors into three linear terms .",
    "hence , we obtain at most @xmath121 local extrema .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , using a characterization from  @xcite , it is even possible to compute smallest circumscribing cylinder of an equifacial simplex esentially without any algebraic computation .",
    "namely , it is well - known that the vertices of an equifacial simplex @xmath113 can be regarded as four pairwise non - adjacent vertices of a rectangular box ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , there exists a representation @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "assuming without loss of generality @xmath85 , ( [ eq : tansphere ] ) gives @xmath127 subtracting these equations pairwise gives @xmath128 ( for indices 1 , 2 ) and analogous equations , so that @xmath129 since @xmath87 , this yields @xmath130 . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume @xmath131 .",
    "in this case , @xmath132 so we can express  ( [ eq : equifacialstart ] ) in terms of the direction vector @xmath80 , @xmath133 which , by using @xmath134 , gives @xmath135 thus , by computing the derivative of this expression @xmath136 and taking into account the three cases @xmath137 , we can reduce the computation of the minimal circumscribing cylinder to solving three univariate equations of degree  3 .",
    "however , we can still do better .",
    "substitute @xmath138 , and let @xmath139 be the expression for @xmath140 in terms of @xmath141 , @xmath142 since the second derivative of that quadratic function is negative , @xmath143 is a concave function .",
    "hence , within the interval @xmath144 $ ] , the minimum is attained at one of the boundary values @xmath145 .",
    "consequently , two of the components of @xmath146 must be zero and therefore @xmath80 is perpendicular to two opposite edges . since the latter geometric characterization is independent of our specific choice of coordinates , we can conclude :    [ eq : equifacialminradius ] if all four faces of the simplex @xmath113 have the same area then the axis of a minimum circumscribing cylinder is perpendicular to two opposite edges .",
    "hence , for an equifacial simplex it suffices to investigate the cross products of the three pairs of opposite edges ( equipped with an orientation ) , and we do not need to solve a system of polynomial equations at all .    in order to illustrate how these three solutions relate to the 18 solutions of the general approach above , we consider the regular simplex in @xmath2 . in the general approach ,",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , the six edge directions @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) all have multiplicity  1 , and each of the three directions in lemma  [ eq : equifacialminradius ] , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , have multiplicity 4 .",
