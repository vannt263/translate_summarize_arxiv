    "the relativistic kinetic energy of a quantum electron is described by the dirac operator @xmath9 acting on @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 here , the units are taken so that the reduced planck s constant @xmath14 , the speed of light @xmath15 , and the mass of an electron @xmath16 , are all set to 1 .",
    "the spectrum of the dirac operator is @xmath17\\cup[1,+{{\\ensuremath { \\infty}}})$ ] . to explain why real electrons have a positive kinetic energy , dirac suggested to postulate that , in nature , all the negative kinetic energy states of the dirac operator are already occupied by virtual electrons .",
    "thus , the relativistic vacuum is composed of infinitely many charged , virtual particles , usually called the _ dirac sea_.    in an external electromagnetic field , the distribution of charge of the dirac sea changes .",
    "this phenomenon is called _",
    "vacuum polarization_. in the same spirit , a negative kinetic energy virtual electron can turn into a positive kinetic energy real electron when given enough energy .",
    "this transformation results in a `` hole '' in the dirac sea , which itself has a positive energy with respect to the fully filled dirac sea .",
    "this hole can thus be observed and is identified with the anti - particle of the electron , the positron .",
    "hence , such a process is labeled _ electron / positron pair production_. in this paper , we are interested in the case where this energy is brought to the vacuum by an external , classical electric field . this situation has been originally considered by sauter@xcite , heisenberg - euler @xcite , and schwinger @xcite .",
    "since it is non - negligible compared to the other sources of pair production only for huge electric fields , it has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "however , the creation of such a strong field could be achieved in the near future , due to recent progress in laser physics @xcite .",
    "there exists two approaches to the problem of electron / positron pair production under an external electric potential @xmath18 .",
    "the first one consists in studying the vacuum in its ground state , in the presence of @xmath18 .",
    "one tries to determine if the vacuum then contains real particles or not , if @xmath18 is strong enough .",
    "in other words , for large @xmath18 one expects that it is energetically more favorable for the vacuum to contain real electrons or positrons , than to contain no real particle at all .",
    "if the vacuum contains real particles , we say that the external potential @xmath18 produces pairs , or more precisely produces particles .",
    "indeed , for this formulation of electron / positron pair production , called _ static _",
    "pair production , it is not necessary that the number of electrons created is the same as the number of positrons created . we still refer to it as pair production though , because one can think of it as a localized particle together with an anti - particle at infinity .",
    "the second approach consists in studying the time evolution of the vacuum with no electron and no positron ( the _ free _ vacuum ) , when the external field is compactly supported in time .",
    "one wants to determine if , for large times , some pairs still exist . in this case ,",
    "notice that it is necessarily pairs that are produced since the total charge of the system is conserved . the second approach is thus called _ dynamical _ pair production . while dynamical pair production may be more relevant from a physical point of view , it is also much harder to study mathematically .",
    "only a few mathematical results are known about electron / positron pair production .",
    "indeed , one has to deal with infinitely many relativistic particles , interacting with an external field and possibly with each other .",
    "the correct theory to describe such systems is quantum electrodynamics , which has only been formulated in a perturbative fashion so far .",
    "even the apparently simpler many - body theory of @xmath19 relativistic electrons is not well - defined mathematically . for the time being , one has to make approximations to obtain results about such systems .",
    "the case where the interactions between the particles are neglected is one of these approximations . in this",
    "setting , everything reduces to the spectral theory of the one - body operator @xmath20 , for which the issue of dealing with an infinite number of particles does not exist anymore .",
    "the problem of static pair production has been studied by klaus and scharf @xcite .",
    "the question of dynamical pair production has been tackled in the non - interacting case by pickl and drr @xcite , who proved that pairs were created for a certain class of potentials adiabatically evolving in time .",
    "this relies on a subtle analysis of the dispersive properties of the essential spectrum of the dirac operator .    when the interactions between the particles are taken into account",
    ", one can perform a mean - field approximation to again reduce the problem to the one - body space .",
    "the additional difficulty compared to the case without interactions is that the state of the system is not described by a wavefunction anymore , but rather by a _",
    "one - body density matrix _ , an infinite - rank operator on the one - body space ( usually an orthogonal projection ) .",
    "the idea of performing a mean - field approximation of quantum electrodynamics goes back to chaix and iracane @xcite .",
    "the first rigorous models formulating these ideas were developed by hainzl and siedentop @xcite , and by bach , barbaroux , helffer , and siedentop @xcite .",
    "later on , another related model , which took into account vacuum polarization , was introduced by hainzl , lewin , and sr in 2005 @xcite , and extended in a series of articles by gravejat , hainzl , lewin , sr and solovej @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we will use the latter , called the _ bogoliubov - dirac - fock _ model .",
    "in particular , the polarized vacuum is constructed in a rigorous fashion as a ground state of a certain nonlinear energy functional .",
    "static electron / positron pair production has already been studied by the author in this framework in a previous work @xcite .    in the case without interactions , the one - body density matrix of the vacuum polarized by a potential @xmath18 is given by @xmath21}\\left(d^0+v\\right)}}}.\\ ] ] if @xmath18 is smooth enough , the eigenvalues of @xmath22 are continuous with respect to the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "klaus and scharf @xcite proved ( in the case @xmath24 ) that a particle is created in the vacuum if one of these eigenvalues _ crosses 0 _ when increasing @xmath23 .",
    "if it crosses from the right to the left , it corresponds to the creation of an electron , while if it crosses from the left to the right , it corresponds to the creation of a positron . by the min - max principle of @xcite , in the case",
    "@xmath24 eigenvalues can only decrease so only electrons are created .",
    "this picture was confirmed by hainzl @xcite , from the point of view of the charge density of the system . when interactions are turned on",
    ", the one - body density matrix of the polarized vacuum satisfies a nonlinear equation of the form @xmath25}\\left(d^0+v+\\alpha x_p\\right)}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is an operator depending on @xmath27 ( see equation below ) and @xmath7 is a coupling constant controlling the size of the non - linearity ( or , equivalently , the size of the interactions ) .",
    "the number @xmath0 can also be interpreted as the square of the charge of an electron , @xmath28 , in which case it should also appear in front of the electric potential @xmath18 .",
    "since we are interested in pair production in strong fields , it is also natural to consider a fixed potential @xmath18 ( interpreted as the shape of a nucleus , for instance ) , which strength is controlled by a parameter @xmath29 ( interpreted as the charge of the nucleus ) .",
    "the equation satisfied by @xmath27 is then @xmath30}\\left(d^0+(\\alpha z)v+\\alpha x_p\\right)}}},\\ ] ] as a consequence , studying for @xmath18 fixed and @xmath7 small is the same as studying for @xmath31 fixed and @xmath7 small , which is a well - known regime in the physics literature @xcite . in the sequel , we will thus write @xmath32 . the existence of a solution to is non trivial .",
    "actually , one can show that there is _ no _ projection on @xmath10 satisfying .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to impose an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath33 , and to solve instead @xmath34}\\left(\\pi_\\lambda(d^0+\\kappa v+\\alpha x_p)\\pi_\\lambda\\right)}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the multiplication operator in fourier space by @xmath36",

    "we interpret this result as a _ first order charge renormalization _ of our model , meaning that we can compute the screening induced by the polarized vacuum explicitly in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the term `` first order '' refers here to the fact that this is valid only in the limit @xmath38 . roughly speaking , if we put an external potential @xmath18 in the vacuum , what we observe in return ( in the limit @xmath38 )",
    "is a screened potential @xmath39 , with @xmath40 a similar formula was already obtained in @xcite , and it was valid _ for all @xmath7_. however ,",
    "in @xcite , the non - linearity @xmath26 is simpler than the one we consider in this article ( namely , it does not contain the so - called _ exchange term _ ) . here",
    ", we obtain only in the limit @xmath38 , but we manage to include the exchange term .    finally , we study static pair production for this model with interactions . because of the nonlinearity @xmath26 , it is not clear if the picture provided by klaus and scharf is still valid , that is if an eigenvalue of @xmath41 crosses 0 when @xmath23 is increased , then a particle is created . instead , we will compare two operators @xmath42}\\left(\\pi_\\lambda(d^0+\\kappa v+\\alpha x_{p_+})\\pi_\\lambda\\right)}}},\\ ] ] and @xmath43}\\left(\\pi_\\lambda(d^0+\\kappa v+\\alpha x_{p_-})\\pi_\\lambda\\right)}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath44 .",
    "if the operator @xmath22 has an eigenvalue @xmath45 and @xmath0 is small enough , @xmath46 is interpreted as the polarized vacuum with a certain charge @xmath47 , while @xmath48 is the polarized vacuum with charge @xmath49 .",
    "we want to determine which one is the most advantageous energetically .",
    "to do so , we introduce the function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the energy functional which will be defined in the next section .",
    "our second result ( theorem [ thm : thm2 ] ) provides an explicit formula valid for @xmath0 small enough and @xmath4 fixed @xmath52 where @xmath39 is given by .",
    "in particular , if @xmath53 is positive for @xmath54 and negative for @xmath55 , then the polarized vacuum has charge @xmath47 for @xmath56 and charge @xmath49 for @xmath57 : an electron is created ; if @xmath53 is negative for @xmath54 and positive for @xmath55 , then a positron is created .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath58 as @xmath38 with @xmath4 fixed . hence ,",
    "due to the screening of the polarized vacuum , static pair production in the interacting case requires a stronger potential than in the non - interacting case .    in principle",
    ", we can expand explicitly the function @xmath59 to any order .",
    "for instance , we can compute the next order of @xmath59 in @xmath0 , that is @xmath60 .",
    "we are interested in the sign of this quantity , which would determine the growth of @xmath59 to the next order .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to determine its sign , due to the complicated form of this term .",
    "it remains an interesting open problem to compute this sign .",
    "finally , let us mention @xcite , where the same regime @xmath38 , @xmath4 fixed is studied without external field and for the vacuum of charge 1 , interpreted as an electron together with the dirac sea .",
