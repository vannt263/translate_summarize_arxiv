    "the study of geodesics of charged black holes in string theory is an important area of research , this is because where the gravity meets all other fundamental forces in nature and the classical equation of motion takes the form of einstein equations plus planck scale correction terms .",
    "a primary work by considering the circular motion and the scattering problem of charged particles by a charged dilatonic black hole with arbitrary coupling constant @xmath24 was realized by maki and shiraishi @xcite , however there is no detailed discussion of effective potential that accounts for all orbits allowed . in this work",
    "we are interested in investigating the time - like geodesics around a gmghs black hole which corresponds to the case @xmath25 , since once this task is performed , geodesic structure for this space - time is completed , because the null geodesics were resolved fully by fernando @xcite , while the study of the gravitational lensing was performed in @xcite . also , the geodesic motion of neutral test particles for equatorial time - like circular geodesic and null circular geodesic , both extremal and non - extremal case of charged black hole in string theory was studied in @xcite , whereas the geodesic motion in the multiply warped product space - time near the hypersurfaces in the interior of the event horizon can be found in @xcite .",
