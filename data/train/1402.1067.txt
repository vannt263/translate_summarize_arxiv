    "quantum waveguides have been studied by physicists , chemists and mathematicians for many years now and the rate at which new contributions appear is still high ( see  @xcite and references therein )",
    ". mathematically speaking , a conventional quantum waveguide corresponds to the study of the dirichlet laplacian on a thin tube around a smooth curve in @xmath1 .",
    "of particular interest are effects of the geometry of the tube on the spectrum of and the unitary group generated by the laplacian .",
    "similarly so - called quantum layers , i.e.  the laplacian on a thin layer around a smooth surface , have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the related problem of the constraining of a quantum particle to a neighbourhood of such a curve ( or surface ) by a steep potential rather than through the boundary condition was studied in  @xcite .",
    "recently , progress has also been made on quantum waveguides and layers in magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "there are obvious geometric generalisations of these concepts .",
    "one can consider the dirichlet laplacian on small neighbourhoods of @xmath4-dimensional submanifolds of @xmath10 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or of any @xmath11-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "another possibility is to look at the laplacian on the boundary of such a submanifold , which , in the case of a conventional waveguide , is a cylindrical surface around a curve in @xmath1 . beyond generalising to higher dimension and codimension , one could also ask for waveguides with cross - sections that change their shape and size along the curve , or more generally along the submanifold around which the waveguide is modelled .    in the majority of mathematical works on quantum waveguides , with the exception of  @xcite ,",
    "such variations of the cross - section along the curve must be excluded .",
    "the reason is that , physically speaking , localizing a quantum particle to a thin domain leads to large kinetic energies in the constrained directions , i.e.  in the directions normal to the curve for a conventional waveguide , and that variations of the cross - section lead to exchange of this kinetic energy between normal and tangent directions .",
    "however , the common approaches require that the laplacian acts only on functions that have much smaller derivatives in the tangent directions than in the normal directions . in this paper",
    "we show how to cope with several of the possible generalisations mentioned above : ( i ) we consider general dimension and codimension of the submanifold along which the waveguide is modelled .",
    "( ii ) we allow for general variations of the cross - sections along the submanifold and thus necessarily for kinetic energies of the same order in all directions , with possible exchange of energy between the tangent and normal directions .",
    "( iii ) we also include the case of `` hollow '' waveguides , i.e.  the laplacian on the boundary of a general `` massive '' quantum waveguide .",
    "all of this is achieved by developing a suitable geometric framework for general quantum waveguides and by the subsequent application of recent results on the adiabatic limit of schrdinger operators on fibre bundles @xcite . as concrete applications we will mostly emphasise geometric effects and explain , in particular , how the known effects of `` bending '' and `` twisting '' of waveguides in @xmath1 manifest themselves in higher dimensional generalised waveguides .    before going into a more detailed discussion of our results and of the vast literature ,",
    "let us review the main concepts in the context of conventional quantum waveguides in a geometrical language that is already adapted to our subsequent generalisation .",
    "moreover , it will allow us to explain the adiabatic structure of the problem within a simple example .",
    "consider a smooth curve @xmath12 parametrised by arclength with bounded second derivative @xmath13 and its @xmath0-neighbourhood @xmath14 for some @xmath15 . by @xmath16",
    "we denote the image of the curve in @xmath1 and we call @xmath17 the tube of a conventional waveguide .",
    "the aim is to understand the laplace operator @xmath18 on @xmath19 with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath17 in the asymptotic limit @xmath20 . as different metrics will appear in the course of the discussion",
    ", we make the euclidean metric @xmath21 explicit in the laplacian .",
    "for @xmath0 small enough one can map @xmath17 diffeomorphically onto the @xmath0-tube in the normal bundle of @xmath7 . in order to make the following compuations explicit ,",
    "we pick an orthonormal frame along the curve . a natural choice is to start with an orthonormal basis @xmath22 at one point in @xmath7 such that @xmath23 is tangent and @xmath24 are normal to the curve .",
    "then one obtains a ( in this special case global ) unique frame by parallel transport of @xmath22 along the curve @xmath7 .",
    "this construction is sometimes called the relatively parallel adapted frame @xcite . the frame @xmath25 satisfies the differential equation @xmath26 with the components of the mean curvature vector @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) given by @xmath29 the two normal vector fields @xmath30 form an orthonormal frame of @xmath7 s normal bundle @xmath31 . hence , for @xmath15 small enough , there is a canonical identification of the @xmath0-tube in the normal bundle denoted by @xmath32 with the original @xmath0-tube @xmath33 via the map @xmath34 we will refer to @xmath35 as the cross - section of @xmath36 and to @xmath37 as the cross - section of @xmath17 at @xmath38 .    in order to give somewhat more substance to the simple example ,",
    "let us generalise the concept of a conventional waveguide already at this point .",
    "for a smooth function @xmath39 $ ] with @xmath40 let @xmath41 be the tube with varying cross - section @xmath42 , a disc of radius @xmath43 .",
    "this gives rise to a corresponding tube @xmath44 in @xmath1 . to not overburden notation",
    ", we will drop the subscript @xmath45 in the following , i.e.  put @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    by equipping @xmath36 with the pullback metric @xmath48",
    ", we can turn @xmath49 into an isometry .",
    "then the dirichlet laplacian @xmath50 on @xmath19 is unitarily equivalent to the dirichlet laplacian @xmath51 on @xmath52 .    in order to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath51 with respect to the bundle",
    "coordinates @xmath53 associated with the orthonormal frame @xmath54 , we need to compute the pullback metric @xmath55 on the tube @xmath36 .",
    "for the coordinate vector fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , one finds @xmath59 here , we used @xmath60 and the differential equations  . knowing that @xmath61 is an orthonormal frame of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath21 , this yields @xmath63 the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath36 associated to @xmath55 is thus @xmath64 with @xmath65 . as the riemannian volume measure of @xmath55 on coordinate space reads @xmath66 , it is convenient to introduce the multiplication operator @xmath67 with the density @xmath68 as a unitary operator from @xmath52 to @xmath69",
    ". here @xmath70 just denotes lebesgue measure on the coordinate space .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 the rescaling by @xmath74 thus leads to a simpler split up of the laplacian @xmath75 into a horizontal operator @xmath76 and a vertical operator @xmath77 given by the euclidean laplace operator with dirichlet boundary conditions on the cross - sections @xmath42 .",
    "this simplification is , however , at the expense of an additional potential @xmath78 .    since @xmath42 is isometric to the disc of radius @xmath79 , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the vertical operator @xmath77 are @xmath0-dependent and also functions of @xmath38 . in order to arrive at an @xmath0-independent vertical operator and an @xmath0-independent domain , one dilates the fibres of @xmath31 using @xmath80 and its associated lift to a unitary operator mapping @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "one then arrives at @xmath83 with the second order differential operator @xmath84 and the bending potential @xmath85 these terms account for the bending of the curve in the ambient space , i.e.   its extrinsic geometry . in order to make the asymptotic limit @xmath86 more transparent ,",
    "we rescale units of energy in such a way that the transverse energies are of order one by multiplying the full laplacian with @xmath87 . in summary one",
    "finds that @xmath88 is unitarily equivalent to the operator @xmath89 acting on the domain @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath92 thus splits into the horizontal laplacian @xmath93 , the vertical laplacian @xmath94 and a additional differential operator @xmath95 that will be treated as a perturbation .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of the starting point for the born - oppenheimer approximation in molecular physics .",
    "there the @xmath96-coordinate(s ) describe heavy nuclei and @xmath87 equals the inverse mass of the nuclei .",
    "the @xmath97-coordinates describe the electrons with mass of order one . in both cases",
    "the vertical resp .",
    "electron operator depends on @xmath96 : the vertical laplacian @xmath98 in the quantum waveguide hamiltonian @xmath92 depends on @xmath38 through the domain @xmath99 and the electron operator in the molecular hamiltonian depends on @xmath96 through an interaction potential .",
    "this suggests to study the asymptotics @xmath20 for quantum waveguide hamiltonians by the same methods that have been successfully developed for molecular hamiltonians , namely by adiabatic perturbation theory .",
    "the latter allows to seperate slow and fast degrees of freedom in a systematic way .",
    "in the context of quantum waveguides the tangent dynamics are slow compared to the frequencies of the normal modes .    to illustrate the adiabatic structure of the problem ,",
    "let @xmath100 be the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath101 on @xmath102 and denote by @xmath103 the corresponding normalised non - negative eigenfunction , the so - called ground state wave function .",
    "let @xmath104 be the subspace of local product states and @xmath105 the orthogonal projection onto this space .",
    "now the restriction of @xmath92 to the subspace @xmath106 is called the adiabatic approximation of @xmath92 on the ground state band and the associated adiabatic operator is defined by @xmath107 a simple computation using @xmath108 and the unitary identification @xmath109 , @xmath110 , shows that the adiabatic operator @xmath111 can be seen as an operator acting only on functions on the curve  @xmath7 , given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . as such",
    "it is a one - dimensional schrdinger - type operator with potential function @xmath115 and the asymptotic limit @xmath20 corresponds to the semi - classical limit .",
    "this analogy shows that , in general , @xmath116 can not be considered small compared to @xmath117 , despite the factor of @xmath87 . to see this ,",
    "observe that all eigenfunctions @xmath118 ( and also all solutions of the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation ) are necessarily @xmath0-dependent with @xmath119 , unless @xmath120 for some constant @xmath121 . to be more explicit ,",
    "assume that @xmath122 near a global minimum at @xmath123 .",
    "then the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath124 are @xmath125 for @xmath126 . while the level spacing of order @xmath0 is small compared to @xmath127 , it is large compared to the energy scale of order @xmath87 of the geometric potentials .",
    "and for states @xmath118 with @xmath128 the kinetic energy @xmath129 in the tangential direction is of order one .",
    "however , the majority of mathematical works on the subject considers the situation where @xmath130 is of order @xmath87 .",
    "clearly this only yields meaningful results if one assumes @xmath131 for some constant @xmath121 .",
    "but this , in turn , puts strong constraints on the possible geometries of the waveguide , which we avoid in the present paper .",
    "now the obvious mathematical question is : _ to what extent and in which sense do the properties of the adiabatic operator @xmath124 reflect the corresponding properties of @xmath92 ? _ this question was answered in great generality in @xcite and we will translate these results to our setting of generalised quantum waveguides in section  [ sec : mainresults ] . roughly speaking ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : low spectrum ] states that the low - lying eigenvalues of @xmath124 approximate those of @xmath92 up to errors of order @xmath132 in general , and up to order @xmath133 in the special case of @xmath131 . in the latter case the order @xmath132 terms in @xmath124",
    "turn out to be significant as well .",
    "our main new contribution in this work is to introduce the concept of generalised quantum waveguides in section  [ chap : general ] and to compute explicitly the adiabatic operator for such generalised waveguides to all significant orders . for massive quantum waveguides , which are basically `` tubes '' with varying cross - sections modelled over submanifolds of arbitrary dimension and codimension ,",
    "this is done in section  [ chap : massiveqwg ] . there",
    "we follow basically the same strategy as in the simple example given in the present section .",
    "we obtain general expressions for the adiabatic operator , from which we determine the relevant terms for different energy scales . though the underlying calculations of geometric quantities have been long known  @xcite , the contribution of @xmath134 has usually been neglected , because at the energy scale of @xmath87 it is of lower order than @xmath135 .",
    "this changes however on the natural energy scale of the example @xmath136 with non - constant @xmath45 , where they may be of the same order , as we see in section  [ sect : h_a alpha ] .",
    "the contribution of the bending potential is known to be non - positive in dimensions @xmath137 or @xmath138  @xcite , while it has no definite sign in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it was stressed in  @xcite that this leads to competing effects of bending and the non - negative `` twisting potential '' in quantum waveguides whose cross - sections @xmath102 are all isometric but not rotationally invariant and twist along the curve relative to the parallel frame .",
    "the generalisation of this twisting potential is the adiabatic potential @xmath139 , which is always non - negative and of the same order as @xmath135 .",
    "using this general framework we generalise the concept of `` twisted '' waveguides to arbitrary dimension and codimension in section  [ sect : twist ] .",
    "in section  [ chap : hollowqwg ] we finally consider hollow waveguides , which are the boundaries of massive waveguides .",
    "so far there seem to be no results on these waveguides in the literature and the adiabatic operator derived in section  [ sect : h_a hollow ] is completely new . for hollow waveguides",
    "the vertical operator is essentially the laplacian on a compact manifold without boundary and thus its lowest eigenvalue vanishes identically , @xmath140 .",
    "the adiabatic operator on @xmath9 is quite different from the massive case . up to errors of order @xmath132 , it is the sum of the laplacian on @xmath7 and an effective potential given in  .",
    "for the special case of the boundary of @xmath141 discussed above this potential is given by @xmath142   =   { \\varepsilon}^2 \\left[\\tfrac12 \\tfrac{f''}{f } - \\tfrac14 \\big(\\tfrac{f'}{f}\\big)^2\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] which , in contrast to massive waveguides , is independent of the curvature @xmath143 and depends only on the rate of change of vol@xmath144 .",
    "one can check for explicit examples that a local constriction in the tube , e.g.  for @xmath145 , leads to an effective potential with wells .",
    "thus , constrictions can support bound states on the surface of a tube .",
    "in this part we give a precise definition of what we call generalised quantum waveguides . in view of the example discussed in the introduction",
    ", the ambient space @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath11-dimensional euclidean space and the role of the curve is played by an arbitrary smooth @xmath4-dimensional submanifold @xmath5 .",
    "the generalised waveguide @xmath3 is contained in a neighbourhood of the zero section in @xmath31 which can be diffeomorphically mapped to a tubular neighbourhood of @xmath146 .",
    "we will again call @xmath147 the cross - section of the quantum waveguide at the point @xmath38 and essentially assume that @xmath102 and @xmath148 are diffeomorphic for @xmath149 .",
    "this allows for general deformations of the cross - sections as one moves along the base , where in the introduction we only considered scaling by the function @xmath45 .    in order to separate the laplacian into its horizontal and vertical parts ,",
    "we follow the strategy of the previous section . however , it will be more convenient to adopt the equivalent viewpoint , where we implement the scaling within the metric @xmath150 on @xmath151 instead of shrinking @xmath152 and keeping @xmath153 fixed .",
    "for the following considerations , we assume that there exists a tubular neighbourhood @xmath154 with globally fixed diameter , i.e.  there is @xmath155 such that normals to @xmath7 of length less than @xmath156 do not intersect . more precisely , we assume that the map @xmath157 restricted to @xmath158 is a diffeomorphism to its image @xmath159 . again",
    ", this mapping @xmath49 provides a metric @xmath160 on @xmath161 and the rescaled version @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the dilatation of the fibres in @xmath31 .",
    "[ def : highdimqwg ] let @xmath5 be a smooth @xmath4-dimensional submanifold with tubular neighbourhood @xmath164 and @xmath8 be a compact manifold with smooth boundary and @xmath165 .",
    "suppose @xmath166 is a connected subset that is a fibre bundle with projection @xmath167 and typical fibre @xmath8 such that the diagram    m & & b + ^_m & & _ _ b + b & _ _ b&b    commutes .",
    "we then call the pair @xmath168 , with the scaled pullback metric @xmath169 a _ generalised quantum waveguide_.    it immediately follows from the commutative diagram that the cross - sections @xmath102 coincide with the fibres @xmath170 given by the fibre bundle structure . from now on we will usually refer to this object simply as the fibre of @xmath3 over @xmath96 . although other geometries are conceivable , the most interesting examples of generalised waveguides are given by subsets @xmath171 of codimension zero and their boundaries . in the following",
    "we will only treat these two cases and distinguish them by the following terminology :    [ def : massivehollow ] let @xmath172 be a generalised quantum waveguide as in definition  [ def : highdimqwg ] .    1 .",
    "we call @xmath3 _ massive _ if @xmath8 is the closure of an open , bounded and connected subset of @xmath173 with smooth boundary .",
    "we call @xmath3 _ hollow _ if @xmath174 and there exists a massive quantum waveguide @xmath175 such that @xmath176 .",
    "this definition implies @xmath177 , i.e.  each fibre @xmath178 of a hollow quantum waveguide is the boundary of @xmath179 , the fibre of the related massive waveguide @xmath180 .",
    "we denote by @xmath181 the vertical subbundle of @xmath182 .",
    "its elements are vectors that are tangent to the fibres of @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to the orthogonal complement of @xmath183 ( with respect to @xmath184 ) as the horizontal subbundle @xmath185 . clearly @xmath186 and",
    "this decomposition will turn out to be independent of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , the decomposition @xmath187 is orthogonal for every @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we will see ( lemma  [ lem : pullback ] and equation   for the massive case , equation   for hollow waveguides ) that the scaled pullback metric is always of the form @xmath188 where    * @xmath189 is the induced riemannian metric on the submanifold @xmath7 , * @xmath190 is a symmetric ( but not necessarily non - degenerate ) tensor with @xmath191 for any vertical vector field @xmath192 , * @xmath193 is the @xmath0-independent restriction of the scaled pullback metric to its vertical contribution .",
    "thus , if we define for any vector field @xmath194 its unique horizontal lift @xmath195 by the relation @xmath196 , we have @xmath197 for all @xmath198 and @xmath199 .    [ ex : conv ] in the introduction we considered a massive waveguide @xmath200 with @xmath137 and @xmath201 .",
    "the typical fibre was given by @xmath202 .",
    "using the bundle coordinates @xmath53 induced by  , one easily checks the the scaled pullback metric reads @xmath203 hence @xmath204 finally remark that @xmath205 is the typical fibre of the associated hollow waveguide .    after having introduced the geometry of a generalised waveguide @xmath168 , we now analyse the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath206 with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary condition is of course vacuous if @xmath3 is hollow since @xmath207 in that case .",
    "similarly to the introduction  , we apply a unitary @xmath208 ( which equals @xmath209 in the earlier notation ) .",
    "the according scaled density is given by @xmath210 we call the metric @xmath211 the ( scaled ) submersion metric on @xmath3 , since it turns @xmath212 into a riemannian submersion",
    ". the transformed laplacian then reads @xmath213 here , the horizontal laplacian is defined by its quadratic form ( with @xmath214 ) @xmath215 where @xmath216 denotes the orthogonal projection to @xmath217 , so integration by parts yields ( see also section  [ sect : laplace ] ) @xmath218 the vertical operator is given on each fibre @xmath102 by the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath219 with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the bending potential @xmath220 is a by - product of the unitary transformation @xmath221 and the second order differential operator @xmath222 accounts for the corrections to @xmath223 .",
    "in this section we show that the adiabatic operator @xmath111 approximates essential features of generalised quantum waveguide hamiltonians @xmath92 , such as its unitary group and its spectrum .",
    "this motivates the derivation of explicit expansions of @xmath111 in the subsequent sections . in this work",
    "we will only consider the ground state band @xmath224 and pay special attention to the behaviour of @xmath92 for small energies .",
    "this , as we will show , allows to view @xmath111 as an operator on @xmath9 .",
    "the results of this section were derived in  @xcite in more generality .    for a massive quantum waveguide set @xmath225 and for a hollow waveguide @xmath226 let @xmath227 be the smallest eigenvalue of the fibre operator @xmath228 acting on the fibre over @xmath96 . for hollow waveguides",
    "we have no boundary and @xmath229 with the eigenfunction @xmath230 in the massive case we have @xmath231 and denote by @xmath232 the uniquely determined positive normalised eigenfunction of @xmath233 with eigenvalue @xmath224 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the orthogonal projection in @xmath234 defined by @xmath235 the image of this projection is the subspace @xmath236 of @xmath234 .",
    "the function @xmath237 and its derivatives , both horizontal and vertical , are uniformly bounded in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the action of the horizontal laplacian @xmath238 on @xmath237 gives a term of order @xmath0 and @xmath239p_0 = [ h^{\\varepsilon}- h_f , p_0]p_0=\\mathcal{o}({\\varepsilon})\\label{eq : p0comm}\\ ] ] as an operator from @xmath240 to @xmath234 .",
    "since this expression equals @xmath241 , this justifies the adiabatic approximation   for states in the image of @xmath105 .",
    "however , the error is of order @xmath0 , while interesting effects of the geometry , such as the potentials @xmath139 and @xmath242 discussed in the introduction , are of order @xmath87 . because of this it is desirable to construct also a super - adiabatic approximation , consisting of a modified projection @xmath243 and an intertwining unitary @xmath244 with @xmath245 , such that the effective operator @xmath246 provides a better approximation of @xmath92 than @xmath124 does .",
    "it then turns out that the approximation provided by @xmath247 can also be made more accurate than expected from   using the unitary @xmath244 .",
