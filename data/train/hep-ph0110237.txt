    "neutrino masses can be incorporated in the standard model ( sm ) or its supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) by adding to the lagrangian the non - renormalizable dimension-5 operator @xcite @xmath0 in which @xmath1 label generations , @xmath2 are the weyl spinors transforming as doublets of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the higgs doublet with hypercharge @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 . after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( [ eqn : dl_sm ] ) gives the neutrino mass matrix in the form @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the higgs field @xmath4 ) , which is diagonalized by the unitary rotation @xmath10 .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath11 determine the neutrino oscillation probabilities and are , therefore , probed in the neutrino experiments .",
    "the operator ( [ eqn : dl_sm ] ) appears in the low energy effective theory as a result of integrating out fields of an underlying theory describing physics at some high energy scale .",
    "thus , it is supposed to be generated at some high scale @xmath12 ( much higher than the electroweak scale @xmath13 ) . therefore obtaining reliable predictions for neutrino masses and",

    "is therefore assumed to be given in that basis too .",
    "the normalization of @xmath18 is fixed by the higgs self interaction : @xmath19 . ] in the sm @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 for quarks and @xmath23 for leptons ; in the mssm @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the solution to eq .",

    "the rge ( [ eqn : rge ] ) was analyzed in many papers @xcite to see how much the initial pattern of neutrino masses and mixing angles generated at the scale @xmath12 is modified by quantum corrections involving large logarithms @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , it has been found @xcite that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rge ] ) exhibits a nontrivial fixed point structure . in many interesting cases ( e.g. for degenerate or partially degenerate neutrino mass spectrum ) that structure leads to the pattern of mixing angles",
    "that is not compatible with the present experimental indications ( i.e. bimaximal mixing and small @xmath34 matrix element ) .",
    "it has been however pointed out @xcite that in the mssm the so - called low energy threshold corrections which were neglected in previous analyses @xcite can in some cases be more important than the rg evolution and can change qualitatively the pattern obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rge ] ) .",
    "in this paper we compute these low energy threshold corrections both in the sm and in the mssm .",
    "we first show that they stabilize the results of the rg running with respect to the choice of the low energy scale @xmath35 ( to clarify the points raised in the recently published paper @xcite we demonstrate this explicitly in a pedagogical way ) and asses their magnitude and dependence on the parameters of the mssm .",
    "in this section we calculate one - loop corrections to the neutrino mass matrix in the sm .",
    "our starting point is the sm lagrangian ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) supplemented with the non - renormalizable term ( [ eqn : dl_sm ] ) .",
    "all parameters of this lagrangian are understood to be running parameters renormalized at the scale @xmath36 .",
    "also the wilson coefficient @xmath14 of the dimension 5 @xmath37 operator ( [ eqn : dl_sm ] ) is a renormalized parameter of the effective theory lagrangian . integrating its rge ( [ eqn : rge ] ) from the high scale @xmath12 down to some scale @xmath31 resums potentially large corrections involving @xmath38 to all orders of the perturbation expansion .",
    "however , since the low energy scale @xmath35 is not _ a priori _ determined by any physical requirement ( apart from the condition @xmath36 ) , the neutrino masses and mixing angles computed in the tree - level approximation from the wilson coefficient @xmath39 do depend ( albeit weakly ) on the actual choice of @xmath35",
    ". this dependence can be removed by computing masses and mixing angles in the one - loop approximation in the @xmath40 scheme with the same renormalization scale @xmath35 .",
    "since the neutrino masses are orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale , the calculation of the low energy threshold corrections is technically most easily achieved in the effective theory approach . at the scale @xmath31",
    "all gauge and higgs bosons are integrated out and the effective theory valid below the electroweak scale is constructed . in this low energy theory",
    "the one - loop neutrino mass matrix @xmath41 is given by the tree - level term ( [ eqn : treemass ] ) of the sm plus the one - loop ( threshold ) correction @xmath42 .",
    "the latter , apart from having leading @xmath43 dependence that exactly matches the @xmath43 dependence of the tree level mass @xmath44 ( [ eqn : treemass ] ) , can also contain nontrivial @xmath35-independent pieces .",
    "writing the sm higgs doublet as @xmath45 we get from ( [ eqn : dl_sm ] ) the neutrino mass term and various interactions ( we write down only those which will be relevant for us ) : @xmath46 in principle to get the feynman rules for neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath47 one has also to rotate the neutrino fields @xmath10 ( where @xmath48 is the matrix diagonalizing @xmath49 ) .",
