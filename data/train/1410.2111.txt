    "the well - established field of nonlinear photonics hosts a vast number of applications , including spatial and spectral control of laser light , all - optical signal processing , ultrafast switching , and sensing @xcite .",
    "because the efficiencies of nonlinear optical processes are generally poor , considerable effort has been devoted towards seeking materials that can display nonlinear effects at low light intensities and ultrafast response times @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "plasmonic nanostructures have been particularly attractive due to their ability to generate high local intensity enhancements through strong confinement of electromagnetic fields @xcite , leading to second - harmonic polarizabilities as high as @xmath0 esu per atom , as measured for noble metal nanoparticles @xcite , and even beating the best molecular chromophores @xcite .",
    "however , although localized plasmons can be customized through the size , shape , and surrounding environment of the metal nanostructures @xcite , they suffer from low lifetimes and lack post - fabrication tunability @xcite .",
    "doped graphene has recently attracted much attention as an alternative plasmonic material capable of sustaining electrically tunable optical excitations with long lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the existence of gate - tunable plasmons in graphene has been confirmed by thz @xcite and mid - infrared @xcite spectroscopies , while optical near - field microscopy has been used to image them in real space @xcite .",
    "efforts to extend the plasmonic response of graphene to the visible and near - infrared regimes are currently underway @xcite .",
    "additionally , graphene has been predicted to display intense nonlinearity due to its anharmonic charge - carrier dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "recent four - wave mixing @xcite , kerr effect @xcite , and third - harmonic generation @xcite experiments already confirm a large third - order response in this material in the undoped , plasmon - free state .",
    "graphene plasmons could amplify this response further @xcite , and even enable strong few - photon interactions in small islands @xcite .        here",
    "we show that the nonlinear optical polarizabilities of small graphene nanoislands ( @xmath1 nm ) exceed by several orders of magnitude those of the best conventional nonlinear materials , including noble metal nanoparticles of similar lateral size ( but obviously of much greater volume ) .",
    "nonlocal and finite - size effects dominate the response of these structures @xcite , which we model in a quantum - mechanical fashion . specifically , we perform density - matrix simulations using a tight - binding description of the electronic states and following complementary time - domain and perturbative approaches ( see details in methods and appendix ) .",

    "although graphene is a centrosymmetric 2d crystal , which ordinarily would prevent even - ordered nonlinear processes from occuring @xcite , this symmetry can be broken by the finite size of the nanoisland .",
    "notice that the mirror symmetry of the nanoisland along @xmath9 results in the vanishing of even - harmonic generation when the incident light is polarized along that direction .",
    "conversely , both odd and even harmonics are observed with a pulse polarized along the asymmetric @xmath10 direction .",
    "interestingly , the intensity of odd harmonics is independent of polarization direction because the nanoisland has threefold rotational symmetry . for the pulse polarized along the @xmath10-direction",

    "the linear polarizability ( fig .  [ fig2]a ) is dominated by a single @xmath13ev plasmon in the spectral region under consideration , which however produces only negligible shg ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) and thg ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "in contrast , when the island is doped , @xmath14ev plasmon features emerge ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , which move towards higher energies as @xmath15 is increased .",
    "these highly - tunable , low - energy dipole plasmon modes are a result of the collective nature of the electronic excitations of the nanoisland , and do not coincide with any dominant electron - hole pair transitions @xcite . incidentally , zigzag edges are detrimental for the emergence of these plasmons and the resulting tunable nonlinear response ( see figs .",
    "[ figs4 ] and [ figs5 ] in the appendix ) .",
    "importantly , intense features appear in the nonlinear spectra at incident photon energies tuned to the low - energy plasmons ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , c ) .",
    "these features exhibit multicomponent line profiles that indicate a complex interplay between the responses at the incident frequency and at multiples of that frequency .",
    "the nonlinear strengths follow a non - monotonic evolution with @xmath15 that we also attribute to that interplay ( see below ) . for quantitative comparisons with bulk materials ,",
    "we approximate the nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 in doped nanographene by considering the polarizability per atom ( denoted here as @xmath18 for the harmonic @xmath19 ) and calculating @xmath20 , where @xmath21@xmath4 is the areal density of carbon atoms in graphene and @xmath22 cm is the effective thickness of a graphene layer ( see right vertical axes in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . for comparison , we note that the third - order susceptibility of extended graphene without the involvement of any plasmons has been measured via four - wave mixing experiments as @xmath23esu , exceeding the maximum value obtained for a 4 nm thick gold film measured under the same experimental conditions @xcite . additionally , third - harmonic generation measurements have yielded values @xmath24esu in graphene @xcite .",

    "[ fig2]d and appendix ) , while it predicts optical bistability at even higher intensities ( @xmath35w@xmath7m@xmath8 ) .",
    "the number of electrons involved in the observed resonances , as estimated from the @xmath36-sum rule @xcite , is roughly proportional to the resonance frequency times the maximum polarizability , where the latter is given by the area of the symbols in the top panel of fig .",
    "although the largest islands studied here involve many electrons in each resonance according to this criterium , and thus , we can legitimately talk about plasmon resonances , it is interesting to note that the mode examined in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d for the @xmath37-atom triangle has an effective strength of only @xmath38 electrons .",

    "it is nonetheless surprising that nonlinear effects are observed at relatively moderate intensities ( e.g. , @xmath39w@xmath7m@xmath8 ) , for which the excited state still has a low population @xmath40 , as estimated by equating the energy absorbed by the particle ( i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the absorption cross section ) to the energy dissipated through plasmon decay ( i.e. , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mode frequency and decay time , respectively ) .",

    "[ fig2]a for low doping . as the nanoisland size increases , and with it the doping level",
    ", the lower - energy modes eventually become dominant . in contrast , the nonlinear polarizabilities exhibit a non - monotonic evolution with both @xmath15 and @xmath47 , which we again attribute to the presence of resonances at both the fundamental and the harmonic frequencies .",
    "when normalized per carbon atom , the thg susceptibilities take extraordinarily large values @xmath48@xmath49esu ( see appendix and below ) .    a mechanism of double plasmonic enhancement is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , showing anomalously large nonlinear polarizabilities when a plasmon exists at a multiple of the fundamental frequency , which is in turn tuned to another plasmon .",
    "this phenomenon has been recently invoked to predict nonlinearities in graphene islands at the single - photon level @xcite . for shg ,",
    "[ fig4]a shows this effect taking place for an island consisting of @xmath50 atoms . similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig4]b shows large thg with @xmath51 .",
    "the non - monotonic evolution of the nonlinear polarizabilities with size and doping noted in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are also due to this type of double resonance effect . for a fixed geometry , the double enhancement phenomenon should be attainable by varying the doping charge density : consider , for example , the highly - tunable , low - energy dipole plasmon mode of fig .",

    "this phenomenon should also occur in imperfect nanoislands with a predominance of armchair edges , although higher levels of doping could be necessary ( see fig .",

    "[ fig5]a shows that the shg polarizabilities predicted for nanographene exceed by three orders of magnitude the optimal values measured for noble metal nanoparticles of similar lateral size . for a comprehensive comparison of shg with noble metals , we present data from experiments performed on various nanoparticle morphologies , including highly asymmetric structures , as well as for different excitation frequencies @xcite .",
    "the comparison per unit volume is even more favorable to graphene , as it is an atomically thin structure , in contrast to the three dimensional nanoparticles .",
    "the third - order polarizability in graphene is also above that measured for copper and silver @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) , and more so when considering that these measurements refer to fully degenerate four - wave mixing experiments , which tend to yield significantly higher values than those obtained when looking at thg or non - degenerate four - wave mixing @xcite .",
    "although larger graphene islands present a computational challenge beyond our current computational capabilities , the pace at which their nonlinear polarizabilities increase with size should be faster than that of noble metals , as expected from the extrapolation of the dashed curves in fig .",
    "it should be noted that this occurs at plasmon energies that eventually evolve towards the mid infrared ( see fig .  [ fig3]a ) , whereas the size range here explored yields tunable visible and mid - infrared excitations .",
    "the extraordinary second- and third - harmonic generation reported above warrants further exploration of nonlinear optical phenomena in doped nanographene .",
    "other morphologies apart from nanotriangles should yield similar high levels of nonlinear response , particularly when their edges are predominantly armchair .",
    "graphene nanoislands with sizes comparable to those considered here have already been fabricated using various methods @xcite , although they lack precise control over size and shape , which limits their applicability to nonlinear photonic technologies .",
    "alternatively , a bottom - up approach based upon chemical self - asembly of molecular precursors provides better degree of control over the sizes and edge configurations @xcite . in practical devices ,",
    "electrical doping can be introduced in the nanoislands through a transparent substrate @xcite , or by placing them close to a contact , from which electrons can be tunneled .",
    "arrayed nanoislands can transform a substantial fraction of the incident light energy into nonlinear harmonics ( see fig .  [ figs7 ] in the appendix ) .",
    "our results indicate that a relatively small amount of charge transferred to a graphene nanoisland can facilitate a dramatic increase in the magnitude of the nonlinear polarizability .",

    "an estimate for the nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 for doped nanographene can be obtained from the polarizability per atom ( denoted here as @xmath18 for the harmonic @xmath19 ) by using the relation @xmath193 , where @xmath21@xmath4 is the density of carbon atoms in bulk graphene and @xmath194 cm is the effective thickness of a graphene layer . using this approach , the results presented in fig .",

    "this is a conservative choice , because chemical synthesis of finite - sized nanoislands should enable fabrication of nanographene with fewer defects and less disorder .",
    "arguably , graphene phonons may also contribute to losses via phonon - plasmon coupling decay channels , in particular for optical phonons near @xmath198ev @xcite .",
    "these modes are essentially connected with the stretching oscillations of c - c bonds , so they are very localized and give rise to relatively dispersionless bands .",
