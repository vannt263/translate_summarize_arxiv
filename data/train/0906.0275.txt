    "nonlinear coherent states are then defined as the right eigenstates of the generalized annihilation operator @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 . in",
    "the number state bases the explicit form of these states are given by @xmath12 with the coefficients @xmath13 as @xmath14^{-1}\\ ] ] and by definition @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 in ( [ newket ] ) denotes a normalization constant and can be fixed up using @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 note that we confine ourselves to the special case of real valued functions @xmath4 . with the help of equation ( [ dn ] ) the function @xmath4 corresponding to any set of generalized coherent states",
    "is found to be related to the expansion coefficients by @xmath19 manko @xmath20 @xmath21 introduced the hamiltonian of the deformed oscillator analogously to the harmonic oscillators as @xcite @xmath22 but later , roknizadeh @xmath20 @xmath21 derived a hamiltonian associated to a nonlinear system which was indeed the normal - ordered form of manko s hamiltonian based on action identity requirement of nonlinear coherent states as follows @xcite @xmath23 so the eigenvalue equation for any physical system with known discrete eigenvalues may be given by @xmath24 thus one simply has @xmath25 which indicates that the nonlinearity function corresponding to any quantum system with known discrete spectrum can be easily found .",

    "it is straightforward to check that the following eigenvalue equation holds : @xmath31 .",
    "it must be noted that the @xmath32 factor is an operator - valued function which acts on the bases @xmath33 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the notion of quantum phase is an important concept in physics , especially in quantum optics .",
    "it has been given a great deal of attention for a long time , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "searching for a hermitian phase operator of radiation field has a long history from the beginnings of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the initial attempts to construct explicitly a quantum phase operator as a quantity conjugate to the number operator were made by dirac @xcite .",
    "the idea was to perform a polar decomposition of the annihilation operator , similar to the polar decomposition of the complex amplitude performed for classical fields .",
    "susskind and glogower @xcite propose an exponential phase operator based on dirac s idea , with an extra condition related to vacuum . unfortunately , although their formalism permits to define associated hermitian operators , it has still a serious problem : it is non - unitary .",
    "later barnett and pegg @xcite introduced a unitary operator in an extended hilbert space .",
    "the apparent difficulty of the latter proposal is that it included unphysical negative number states . along these efforts ,",
    "a very important development in this field has been made by pegg and barnett @xcite .",
    "they have defined a unitary and hermitian phase operator , and a phase state but in a finite although arbitrarily large subspace whose dimension was allowed to tend to infinity after the calculation of expectation values of observable quantities and moments @xcite ( the point that we concern with it when deal with uncertainties in phase and number operators ) . up to now",
    ", the above three formalisms have been used along each other in the studies of phase properties and the phase fluctuations of various physical systems .",
    "a deep investigation in the three suggestions shows that all of them are problematic and the exact description of phase operator is still an open problem ( for a review on the subject see @xcite ) .",
    "altogether , in quantum optics the pegg - barnett formalism has been extensively employed in recent literature on the phase properties of a wide variety of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "we choose this formalism also due to the fact that it gives the ground state @xmath34 a random phase which avoids some of the drawbacks in previous developments .",
    "+ phase properties of nonlinear coherent states associated to the center of mass motion of a trapped ion have been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the increasing interest in their nonclassical properties .",
    "we continued this formalism with a few new classes of nonlinear coherent states such as penson- solomon nonlinear coherent states and su(1,1 ) coherent states in two distinct representation , i.e. , barut - girardello and gilmore - perelomov . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge",
    "they are limited to specific systems with known nonlinearity functions .",
    "generally , nonlinearity functions correspond to some nonlinear oscillator algebras comes out from the algebraic deformations procedure . by this",
    "we mean that they are not directly extracted from a physical potential .",
    "the main goal of the present manuscript is to extend the approach to arbitrary quantum system with known discrete spectrum using a simple idea based on the nonlinear coherent states approach .",
    "our motivation is to provide a general framework to investigate the phase distribution , and squeezing in phase and number operators as nonclassical features of some quantum systems such as hydrogen - like atoms , pschl - teller potentials and isotonic oscillator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . keeping in mind the pegg - barnett phase distribution formalism for `` nonlinear coherent states '' we extend it to `` solvable quantum systems '' in the next section .",
    "there , we will obtain the phase distribution of both categories , i.e. , in terms of @xmath4 or @xmath35 .",
    "then in section 3 squeezing properties in phase or number operator corresponding to nonlinear coherent states and solvable quantum systems are studied in a general framework . finally in section 4 the presented approach",
    "are applied to a few classes of generalized coherent stats with known nonlinearity functions as well as to some solvable quantum systems and the nonclassicality of the obtained states are investigated numerically .",
    "according to the pegg - barnett formalism a complete set of @xmath36 orthonormal phase states @xmath37 are defined by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the number states and @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 with arbitrary @xmath42 value .",
