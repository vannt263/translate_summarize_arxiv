    "descent theory is a generalization of a solution given by grothendieck to a problem related to modules over rings @xcite .",
    "there is a pseudofunctor @xmath1 which associates each ring @xmath2 with the category @xmath3 of right @xmath4-modules .",
    "the original problem of descent is the following : given a morphism @xmath5 of rings , we wish to understand what is the image of @xmath6 .",
    "the usual approach to this problem in descent theory is somewhat indirect : firstly , we characterize the morphisms @xmath7 in @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is a functor that forgets some `` extra structure '' .",
    "then , we would get an easier problem : verifying which objects of @xmath10 could be endowed with such extra structure ( see , for instance , @xcite )",
    ".    given a category @xmath11 with pullbacks and a pseudofunctor @xmath12 , for each morphism @xmath13 of @xmath14 , the _ descent data _ plays the role of such `` extra structure '' in the basic problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , in this context , there is a natural construction of a category @xmath15 , called descent category , such that the objects of @xmath16 are objects of @xmath17 endowed with descent data , which encompasses the @xmath0-dimensional analogue for equality/@xmath18-dimensional descent : one invertible @xmath0-cell plus coherence .",
    "this construction comes with a comparison functor and a factorization ; that is to say , we have the commutative diagram below , in which @xmath19 is the functor which forgets the descent data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath20 ^ -{\\phi _ p}\\ar[rd ] _ { \\aaa ( p ) } & { \\desc } _",
    "\\aaa ( p ) \\ar[d]\\\\ & \\aaa ( e)}\\ ] ] therefore the problem is reduced to investigating whether the _ comparison _ functor @xmath21 is an equivalence .",
    "if it is so , @xmath22 is is said to be of _ effective @xmath23-descent _ and the image of @xmath24 are the objects of @xmath25 that can be endowed with descent data . pursuing this strategy ,",

    "thereby , taking into account the original basic problem , we can ask , hence , if @xmath30 is ( co)monadic . again",
    ", we would get a factorization , the eilenberg - moore factorization : @xmath31 ^ -{\\phi } \\ar[rd]_{f } & ( co)\\alg \\ar[d]\\\\ & \\ddd } \\ ] ] and this approach leads to what is called `` monadic descent theory '' .",
    "bnabou and roubaud proved that , if the functor @xmath30 is induced by a pseudofunctor @xmath32 such that every @xmath33 has a left adjoint and @xmath26 satisfies the beck - chevalley condition , then `` monadic @xmath23-descent theory '' coincides with `` grothendieck @xmath23-descent theory '' .",
    "more precisely , assuming the hypotheses above , the morphism that induces @xmath30 is of effective descent if and only if @xmath30 is monadic @xcite .    thereby , in the core of classical descent theory , there are two constructions : the category of algebras and the descent category .",
    "these constructions are known to be examples of @xmath0-categorical limits ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , in a @xmath0-categorical perspective , we can say that the general idea of category of objects with `` extra structure ( plus coherence ) '' is , indeed , captured by the notion of @xmath0-dimensional limits .",
    "not contradicting such point of view , street considered that ( higher ) descent theory is about the higher categorical notion of limit @xcite . following this posture",
    ", we investigate whether pure formal methods and commuting properties of bilimits are useful to prove classical and new theorems in the classical context of descent theory of @xcite .",
    "willing to give such formal approach , we employ the following perspective : _ the problems of descent theory are usually reduced to the study of the image of a ( pseudo)monadic ( pseudo)functor_. we restrict our attention to idempotent pseudomonads and prove formal results on pseudoalgebra structures , such as a biadjoint triangle theorem and lifting theorems .    in order to apply such formal approach to get theorems on commutativity of bilimits , we employ a bicategorical analogue of the concept of ( pointwise ) kan extension : ( pointwise ) pseudo - kan extension , introduced in @xcite .    by successive applications of these formal results ,",
    "we get results within the context of @xcite , such as the bnabou - roubaud theorem , embedding results and theorems on effective descent morphisms of bilimits of categories .",
    "we also apply this approach to get results on effective descent morphisms of categories of small enriched categories @xmath34 provided that @xmath35 satisfies suitable hypotheses .    in this direction , the fundamental standpoint on `` classical descent theory '' of this paper",
    "is the following : the `` descent object '' of a ( pseudo)cosimplicial object in a given context is the image of the initial object of the appropriate notion of kan extension of such cosimplicial object . more precisely , in our context of dimension @xmath0 ( which is the same context of @xcite ) , we get the following result ( theorem [ indeeddescent ] ) : _ the descent category of a pseudocosimplicial object @xmath36 is equivalent to @xmath37 _ , in which @xmath38 is the full inclusion of the category of finite nonempty ordinals into the category of finite ordinals and order preserving functions , and @xmath39 denotes the right pseudo - kan extension of @xmath26 along @xmath40 . in particular , we show abstract features of the `` classical theory of descent '' as a theory ( of pseudo - kan extensions ) of pseudocosimplicial objects or pseudofunctors @xmath41 .",
    "this work was motivated by three main aims .",
    "firstly , to get formal proofs of classical results of descent theory . secondly , to prove new results in the classical context  for instance , formal ways of getting sufficient conditions for a morphism to be effective descent .",
    "thirdly , to get proofs of descent theorems that could be recovered in other contexts , such as in the development of higher descent theory ( see , for instance , the work of hermida @xcite and street @xcite in this direction ) .    in section [ basic problem ]",
    ", we give an idea of our scope within the context of @xcite : we show the main results classically used to deal with the problem of characterization of effective descent morphisms and we present classical results , which are proved using results on commutativity in sections [ proofsclassical ] and [ further ] .",
    "namely , the embedding results ( theorems [ facil1 ] and [ mergulho ] ) and the bnabou - roubaud theorem ( theorem [ roubaud ] ) . at the end of section [ basic problem ] , we establish a theorem on pseudopullbacks of categories ( theorem [ pseudopullback ] ) which is proved in section [ further ] .",
    "section [ formal ] contains most of the abstract results of our formal approach to descent via pseudomonad theory .",
    "we start by establishing our main setting : the tricategory of @xmath0-categories , pseudofunctors and pseudonatural transformations . in [ idempotent ] , we define and study basic aspects of idempotent pseudomonads .",
    "then , in [ btt ] , we study pseudoalgebra structures w.r.t .",
    "idempotent pseudomonads , proving a biadjoint triangle theorem ( theorem [ biadjointtriangle ] ) and giving a result related to the study of pseudoalgebra structures in commutative squares ( corollary [ square ] ) .",
    "we deal with the technical situation of considering objects that can not be endowed with pseudoalgebra structures but have comparison morphisms belonging to a special class of morphisms in [ tecnicoalmost ] .",
    "section [ kan ] explains why we do not use the usual enriched kan extensions to study commutativity of the @xmath0-dimensional limits related to descent theory : the main point is that we like to have results which works for bilimits in general ( not only flexible ones ) . in [ pseudokan ] , we define pseudo - kan extensions and , then , we give the associated factorizations in [ factorization ] .",
    "particular cases of these factorizations are the eilenberg - moore factorization of an adjunction and the descent factorization described above .",
    "we give further background material in [ spointwise ] , studying weighted bilimits and proving that , similarly to the enriched case , the appropriate notion of pointwise pseudo - kan extension is actually a pseudo - kan extension in the presence of weighted bilimits .    in [ psidem ] , [ commu ] and [ tecalmost ]",
    ", we fit the study of pseudo - kan extensions into the perspective of section [ formal ] .",
    "we apply the results of [ formal ] to the special case of weighted bilimits and pseudo - kan extensions : we get , then , results on commutativity of weighted bilimits / pseudo - kan extensions and exactness/_(almost / effective ) descent diagrams_.    section [ descent ] studies _ descent objects_. we prove that the classical descent object ( category ) is given by the pseudo - kan extension of a pseudocosimplicial object ( as explained above ) .",
    "in particular , this means that descent objects are conical bilimits of pseudocosimplicial objects .",
    "we adopt this description as our definition of descent object of a pseudocosimplicial object .",
    "we finish section [ descent ] presenting also the strict version of a descent object , which is given by a kan extension of a special type of @xmath0-diagram .",
    "we get , then , the strict factorization of descent theory .    section [ elementary examples ] gives elementary examples of our context of _ effective descent diagrams_. every weighted bilimit can be seen as an example , but we focus in examples that we use in applications . as mentioned above ,",
    "the most important examples of bilimits in descent theory are descent objects and eilenberg - moore objects : thereby , section [ eilenberg ] is dedicated to explain how eilenberg - moore objects fit in our context , via the free adjunction @xmath0-category of @xcite .    in section [ beck ] , we study the beck - chevalley condition : by doctrinal adjunction  @xcite , this is a condition to guarantee that a pointwise adjunction between pseudoalgebras can be , actually , extended to an adjunction between such pseudoalgebras .",
    "we show how it is related to commutativity of weighted bilimits , giving our first version of a bnabou - roubaud theorem ( theorem [ bfirst ] ) .",
    "we apply our results to the usual context  @xcite of descent theory in section [ proofsclassical ] : we prove a general version ( theorem [ facil1provado ] ) of the embedding results ( theorem [ facil1 ] ) , we prove another bnabou - roubaud theorem ( theorem [ formalbenabou ] ) and , finally , we give a weak version of theorem [ pseudopullback ] .",
    "we finish the paper in section [ further ] : there , we give a stronger result on commutativity ( theorem [ galoisi ] ) and we apply our results to descent theory , proving theorem [ pseudopullback ] and the galois result of @xcite ( theorem [ galoisii ] ) .",
    "we also apply theorem [ pseudopullback ] to get effective descent morphisms of the category of enriched categories @xmath35-@xmath42 , provided that @xmath35 satisfies some hypotheses . for instance",
    ", we apply this result to @xmath43-@xmath42 and @xmath42-@xmath44 .",
    "this work was realized during my phd program at university of coimbra .",
    "i am grateful to my supervisor maria manuel clementino for her precious help , support and attention .",
    "i also thank all the speakers of our informal seminar on descent theory for their insightful talks : maria manuel clementino , george janelidze , andrea montoli , dimitri chikhladze , pier basile and manuela sobral .",
    "finally , i wish to thank stephen lack for our brief conversations which helped me to understand aspects related to this work about @xmath0-dimensional category theory , kan extensions and coherence .",
    "in the context of @xcite , the very basic problem of descent is the characterization of effective descent morphisms w.r.t . the basic fibration . as a consequence of bnabou - roubaud theorem  @xcite ,",
    "this problem is trivial for suitable categories ( for instance , for locally cartesian closed categories ) .",
    "however there are remarkable examples of nontrivial characterizations .",
    "the topological case , solved by tholen and reiterman  @xcite and reformulated by clementino and hofmann  @xcite , is an important example .",
    "below , we present some theorems classically used as a framework to deal with this basic problem . in this paper , we show that most of these theorems are consequences of a formal theorem presented in section [ formal ] , while others are consequences of theorems about bilimits .",
    "firstly , the most fundamental features of descent theory are the descent category and its related factorization . assuming that @xmath11 is a category with pullbacks , if @xmath45 is a pseudofunctor , the [ jtdescent ] is described by janelidze and tholen in @xcite .",
    "we show in section [ descent ] that the concept of pseudo - kan extension encompasses these features .",
    "in fact , the comparison functor and the ( pseudo)factorization described above come from the unit and the triangular identity of the ( bi)adjunction @xmath46\\dashv ( \\ps)\\ran _ \\t $ ] .",
    "secondly , for the nontrivial problems , the usual approach to study ( basic / universal ) effective / almost descent morphisms is the embedding in well behaved categories , in which `` well behaved category '' means just that we know which are the effective descent morphisms of this category . for this matter",
    ", there are some theorems in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "that is to say , the embedding results :    [ facil1 ] let @xmath47 be a pullback preserving functor between categories with pullbacks .    1 .   if @xmath48 is faithful , then @xmath48 reflects almost descent morphisms ; 2 .   if @xmath48 is fully faithful , then @xmath48 reflects descent morphisms .",

    "it is interesting to note that , since theorems [ facil1 ] and [ mergulho ] are just formal properties , they can be applied in other contexts  for instance , for morphisms between pseudofunctors @xmath45 and @xmath54 , as it is explained in section [ proofsclassical ] .    finally , bnabou - roubaud theorem  @xcite is a celebrated result of descent theory which allows us to understand some problems via monadicity : it says that monadic @xmath26-descent theory is equivalent to grothendieck @xmath23-descent theory in suitable cases , such as the basic fibration .",

    "when this happens , we conclude that the inclusion reflects effective descent morphisms by theorem [ pseudopullback ] .",
