    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are energetic celestial objects prominent in a wide range of electromagnetic bands , from the radio up to the highest energies ( x - rays and @xmath2-rays )",
    ". the rich observational phenomena of agn can be understood in the framework of the orientation - based unified scheme ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "approximately 10 per cent of the optically - selected agn are radio - loud @xcite .",
    "the radio - loud fraction of agn may evolve with redshift @xcite , but the causes of this evolution are not well understood yet .",
    "radio - loud agn launch powerful pairs of relativistic jets in the opposite directions perpendicular to the accretion disk which supplies material for the central engine , a supermassive black hole ( smbh , @xmath1@xmath3m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the powerful relativistic jets are usually found in agn with high - mass smbhs , i.e. masses larger than @xmath5m@xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the radio emission of radio - loud agn originates from incoherent synchrotron processes in the jets ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the extended lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the angle between the approaching jet and the line of sight ( i.e. the viewing angle ) is small , the radiation from the approaching jet is strongly enhanced by relativistic beaming .",
    "these agn are called blazars .",
    "blazars can be divided into two main classes : flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lac objects .",
    "the former have prominent optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines , while bl lacs exhibit weak ( the rest frame equivalent width @xmath6   ) or even no emission lines in their spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fsrqs and bl lacs are thought to have different accretion mechanisms , i.e. different types of accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the former are quite luminous in optical , therefore can be seen from large cosmological distances .",
    "the most distant fsrq currently known is q0906 + 6930 at @xmath7 @xcite , while bl lacs are rarely found at redshift @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the multi - band @xmath9 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows a typical double - hump feature . in the one - zone leptonic model @xcite which is widely employed to explain",
    "the blazar sed , the low - energy hump ( peaked at the infrared / x - ray bands ) is due to the synchrotron radiation of the relativistic electrons in the jet , while the high - energy one ( peaked at hard x - ray/@xmath2-ray bands ) is produced by the inverse compton radiation ( ic ) of the same electron population that causes the synchrontron hump .",
    "depending on whether the seed photons are internal or external to the jet , ic can be further classified as synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) or external - compton ( ec ) emission model .",
    "the latter is often used to fit the fsrq seds , so as to obtain the physical parameters of the jets , e.g. the jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath10 and the viewing angle @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "high radio loudness ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ratio of rest - frame 5-ghz and 2500-  flux densities , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath14  w ; the inverse compton hump moves into the x - ray band ) and hard x - ray spectrum are typical characteristics of high - redshift blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "systematic search for high - redshift ( here and henceforth , `` high - redshift '' means @xmath0 ) blazars have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their method was to first select highly radio - loud sources ( radio loudness parameter @xmath15 ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) quasar catalogue @xcite and then to use x - ray data to further confirm the blazar identity of the candidates .",
    "blazars could be used to infer their parent population : statistically , for one blazar with a viewing angle @xmath16 , there should be @xmath17 radio sources with their jets pointing elsewhere .",
    "besides , once the mass of the smbh powering the blazar is known , the number density of smbhs hosted by radio - loud quasars as a function of redshift could then be explored @xcite",
    ".    blazars are compact and bright in the radio , and thus ideal targets for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "in particular , high-@xmath18 blazars allow us to probe the radio emission of the agn in the early universe .",
    "the vlbi images of blazars typically show milli - arcsec ( mas ) scale compact `` core '' emission or a one - sided core  jet structure .",
    "however , the high-@xmath18 ones rarely have prominent jets .",
    "this could be explained by taking into account the relation between the emitted ( rest - frame ) and observed frequencies in the expanding universe : @xmath19 .",
    "while the core has typically flat spectrum ( with a spectral index @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the flux density ) , the spectrum of the jet is steep ( @xmath23 ) . therefore , if we observe at a fixed frequency , the high redshift implies a higher emitted frequency and therefore the extended steep - spectrum emission appears fainter relative to the flat - spectrum core @xcite . to date , only one high - redshift blazar ( j1026 + 2542 , @xmath24 ) is known to have a pronounced jet structure extended to @xmath25-mas scale which allowed @xcite to estimate the apparent proper motion of the jet components using two - epoch vlbi observations separated by more than 7  yr .",

    "compiling larger samples and incorporating more vlbi observations of high-@xmath18 blazars are essential for successfully revisiting these cosmological tests because model differences are the most pronounced at the highest redshifts .",
    "high - resolution vlbi imaging is a powerful tool to directly confirm the blazar classification of the candidates .",

    "if we assume that the structure of the double - lobed radio source is intrinsically symmetric , the flux density difference between the approaching jet side ( @xmath75 ) and the receding counterjet side ( @xmath76 ) is caused by doppler beaming .",

    "we can conclude that , as in the case of j1420 + 1205 , the compact radio emission decected with the evn in this high - redshift source originates from an agn as it shows brightness temperature well above the @xmath84  k limit for normal galaxies @xcite .",

    "one of them was undetected at 5  ghz .",
    "the most plausible explanation of the radio properties of j1548 + 3335 is that a core ( at both frequencies ) and a hot spot ( at 1.7  ghz only ) in one of the two symmetric lobes in the kpc - scale extended structure of the source are seen with the evn .",

    "alternatively , the north - western component of j1420 + 1205 could also be interpreted as a foreground or background radio source physically unrelated to component c. deep follow - up radio interferometric observations with @xmath95arcsec angular resolution could settle this question by detecting a symmetric lobe structure and possibly jet features connecting the core with the lobe(s ) .",
    "another remarkable object in the list of 30 vlbi - imaged high - redshift radio agn compiled by @xcite is j0311 + 0507 ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "the inclination angle of the structure with respect to the line of sight could be close to @xmath97 in j0311 + 0507 @xcite .",

    "the radio structures can naturally be interpreted as expanding young symmetric sources in the early universe , as was also done for j0311 + 0507 by @xcite . simply assuming a constant expansion speed @xmath98 and a moderate jet inclination @xmath11=45",
    ", we obtain a rough estimate of their age , which is below @xmath99  yr .",
    "it is consistent with the value less than @xmath99  yr claimed for j0311 + 0507 by @xcite .",
    "what is puzzling is that both j1420 + 1205 and j2220 + 0025 show properties typical of blazars in x - rays @xcite .      since our vlbi data do not support the blazar classification of j1420 + 1205 and j2220 + 0025 , the strong and hard x - ray emission and the overall sed @xcite call for an alternative explanation . in general ,",
    "agn are prominent x - ray emitters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for radio - quiet agn ,",
    "the x - rays are produced by inverse - compton scattering of the uv / soft x - ray disk photons by the electrons in the hot corona .",
    "for radio - loud agn , x - ray emission can also originate from the relativistic jet .",
    "in fact , the sed is dominated by the jet emission over the widest range of elecromagnetic radiation , from the radio to @xmath2-rays . for blazars ,",
    "the one - zone leptonic model @xcite can successfully explain the double - humped sed .",
    "here the dominant x - ray emission also results from inverse - compton process , and comes from a small dissipation region in the jet near the central engine , where a high density of photons and relativistic electrons is expected .",
    "blazars are divided into three types according the position of the synchrotron peak frequency : low , intermediate , and high synchrotron - peak sources , abbreviated as lsps , isps , and hsps , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "different types may have different origin of seed photons for the inverse - compton hump ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the high-@xmath18 blazars belong to the lsps , because they are very luminous , and luminosity appears to correlate with the frequency peak location ( the  blazar sequence  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "blazars often show strong @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "however , there are no _ fermi _ detections of @xmath0 blazars reported so far . for the very high redshift sources , the inverse - compton peak moves into the x - ray band , and also the @xmath2-rays are likely absorbed in the intergalactic space along the path from large cosmological distances .",
    "only a couple of @xmath2-ray blazars are identified at @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "can extended x - ray structures be responsible for the emission of j1420 + 1205 and j2220 + 0025 ?",
    "to date , kpc - scale x - ray jets have been found in more than 100 objects , the most distant of them is the blazar j1510 + 5702 at @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "their x - ray radiation mechanism is not well understood .",
    "synchrotron emission of a secondary high - energy electron population is favored at low redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the acceleration mechanism producing the high - energy electrons is unclear .",
    "the inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the relativistic electrons in the jet ( the ic / cmb scenario ) may also play an important role at high redshifts , where the energy density of cmb is @xmath102 times higher ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the ic / cmb model works , then luminous x - ray jet components can even outshine the emission of the nucleus in high-@xmath18 sources .",
    "however , such sources are not found at @xmath0 so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the typical jet - to - core x - ray luminosity ratio is @xmath103 or smaller for lower - redshift quasars observed with _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the relativistic electrons in the radio lobes deposited by the jets can not produce x - ray emission via synchrotron radiation because they have lower energies . at redshifts above @xmath104",
    ", the cmb energy density may dominate over the magnetic field energy density .",
    "this intensifies inverse - compton cooling of the electrons , leading to an enhanced ( diffuse ) x - ray emission from the lobes @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from radio lobes has been observed in several sources at redshift @xmath105 and is interpreted as inverse - compton scattering off cmb photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there is no evidence for the diffuse nature of the x - ray emission in j1420 + 1205 and j2220 + 0025 . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite found j1420 + 1205 unresolved with _",
    "chandra _ at a resolution of @xmath106 , which is however not much smaller than the overall size of the radio structure in our vlbi image .",
    "the x - ray source position measured from the image ( right ascension @xmath107 , declination @xmath108 ) is more consistent with that of the compact nuclear vlbi component in fig .",
    "[ fig:1420]a .",
    "there are in principle two possibilities for the origin of x - ray emission in the two sources ( j1420 + 1205 and j2220 + 0025 ) that are clearly not blazars based on our high - resolution vlbi imaging observations .",
    "however , none of the explanations is particularly compelling .    _",
    "( 1 ) _ the x - ray emission may be a combination of the contribution from the ( unbeamed ) inner jet and from the kpc - scale jets and outer lobes ( hot spots ) of these expanding , powerful , presumably young radio sources .",
    "it is to be seen if any meaningful physical model can possibly reproduce the observed x - ray flux and spectral index , as well as the blazar - like sed of these agn .",
    "_ ( 2 ) _ the x - rays originate from the jet launchnig region very close to the smbh .",
    "the approaching jet then suddenly changes its direction on pc scale and appears already misaligned with respect to the line of sight and thus produces no doppler - boosted radio emission on the scale probed by vlbi . while jet direction changes are not unprecedented at larger scales in radio agn due to the interaction with the dense intestellar medium , it is unlikely to happen here , especially in two sources from a small sample of four .",
    "future sensitive spectral and high - resolution x - ray imaging observations of these sources , as well as the other two similar arcsec - scale extended high-@xmath18 sources , j0311 + 0507 @xcite and j1548 + 3335 @xcite , would help understand how these objects work and would provide the necessary input for detailed modeling of the x - ray emission .",
    "it is possible that other x - ray emitting , highly radio - loud agn also mimic the typical blazar properties , yet they belong to different types of sources .",
    "this may contribute to the apparently larger fraction of blazars found in the early universe ( cf .",
    "* ) . in the radio front , sensitive imaging at intermediate ( @xmath1100-mas scale )",
    "resolution is essential to map the extended structure which is mostly resolved out with vlbi , to possibly reveal both of the symmetric lobes and the large - scale jets .",
    "we performed evn observations of four high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) blazar candidates at 1.7 and 5  ghz frequencies .",
    "compact radio emission from all four target sources were detected at both frequencies .",
    "precise astrometric positions were determined with phase - referencing to nearby calibrator sources",
    ". however , the structures observed are spectacularly diverse in this small sample .",
    "the source j2134@xmath260419 is clearly confirmed as a blazar with a flat - spectrum radio core and a doppler - boosted jet emission .",
    "its jet structure extending to @xmath110  mas scale holds the promise of detecting jet component proper motion with multi - epoch 5-ghz vlbi imaging , a rare and valuable opportunity among high - redshift radio agn .",
    "the source j0839 + 5112 has a compact mas - scale structure with flat spectrum , and an indication of flux density variability .",
    "its brightness temperature is not enhanced by relativistic beaming which may indicate a larger inclination angle of the jet .",
    "surprisingly , the two other blazar candidates , j1420 + 1205 and j2220 + 0025 show arcsec - scale extended structures , with most of their flux density resolved out on the long vlbi baselies .",
    "their weak nuclear radio emission seems incompatible with the blazar scenario where the inner jet points nearly to the line of sight .",
    "further sensitive interferometric observations at intermediate resolution would allow us to better characterise their radio structure .",
    "the fact that two of the candidates are clearly non - blazar sources requires the refinement of the broad - band sed modeling and poses an interesting question about the physical origin of their high - energy emission .",
