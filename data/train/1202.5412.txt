    "formation processes of planetesimals have not been well understood in planet formation theory .",
    "the gravitational instability of the dust layer at the midplane of a protoplanetary disk has been proposed as a possible route to planetesimal formation .",
    "the classical scenario of gravitational instability requires high densities of dust layers to surpass the roche limit ( goldreich & ward 1973 ; sekiya 1983 ) .",
    "dust sedimentation only in the vertical direction hardly achieves such a high density ( sekiya 1998 ) .",
    "the dust layer becomes turbulent via kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) or streaming instabilities when its dust density exceeds the gas density , which is much less than the roche density , and further dust settling is significantly suppressed ( chiang & youdin 2010 for review ) .",
    "radial drift of the dust caused by gas drag may provide a possible route for further accumulation of the dust .",
    "when the dissipative effects of gas drag are included , the dust layer is secularly gravitationally unstable to the modes of dust accumulation in the radial direction ( ward 2000 ; youdin 2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "this secular gravitational instability ( sgi ) occurs in any dust layers even if their densities are small ( i.e. , there is no criterion on their toomre s @xmath8 values for sgi ; youdin 2011 ; shariff & cuzzi 2011 ; michikoshi et al . 2012 ; these papers are referred hereafter as y11 , sc11 , and mki12 , respectively ) .    however , the growth rate of sgi is greatly suppressed by gas drag , particularly for small particles , and could be too slow to have any effect on planetesimal formation .",
    "y11 , sc11 , and mki12 argue that the growth timescale must be shorter than the lifetime of the dust drifting toward the star owing to gas drag .",
    "the wavelength of the most unstable mode is determined by the balance between the radial accumulation of dust particles due to self - gravity and their diffusion due to gas turbulence . only perturbations with wavelengths",
    "sufficiently long are unstable . for stronger turbulence ,",
    "wavelengths of the unstable modes , as well as growth timescales , are longer . y11 and sc11 have calculated the growth timescales for various values of the turbulent diffusion parameter @xmath2 , and have derived an upper limit on @xmath2 required for the growth timescale to be shorter than the drift timescale .",
    "their approach is general and can be applied for any disk turbulence , provided that the value of @xmath2 is known .    in this paper , we focus on disk turbulence induced in the dust layer , assuming that the gas disk itself is a globally laminar flow . in such a disk ,",
    "the concentration of dust particles at its midplane triggers turbulence .",
    "the velocity difference between the dust and gas induces the kh or streaming instabilities and causes turbulence in the dust layer ( chiang & youdin 2010 ) .",
    "the ultimate energy source for turbulence is the accretion energy of the dust drifting toward the star , regardless of the kind of instability that occurs in the dust layer .",
    "thus , a simple energetics can be applied to estimate the turbulence strength , provided that the dust accretion velocity is known .",
    "takeuchi et al . ( 2012 , hereafter t12 ) calculate the energy supply rate to turbulence , using the classical formulae on the drift velocity of the dust ( nakagawa et al .",
    "1986 ; weidenschilling 2003 ; youdin & chiang 2004 ) , and then estimate the turbulence strength or the value of @xmath2 .",
    "t12 has shown that , from the comparison between the estimated value of @xmath2 and the recent results of numerical simulations of turbulence by johansen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bai & stone ( 2010 ) , the turbulence strength excited via kh and/or streaming instabilities can be estimated from the dust accretion rate .",
    "while y11 , sc11 , and mki12 have derived the growth time of sgi as a function of @xmath2 and other disk parameters ( equation ( 51 ) of y11 ) , t12 has obtained @xmath2 values of turbulence in the dust layer ( equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) below ) .",
    "combining these results gives an expression of the growth time without the unknown parameter @xmath2 , as shown in section [ sec : growthtime ] .",
    "consequently , in section [ sec : comptime ] , the criterion for sgi to operate is obtained as a condition on the dust abundance @xmath9 in the disk . for sgi to operate faster than the dust drift timescale",
    ", the dust abundance must be greater than a specific critical value @xmath4 , which is a function of the toomre @xmath8 value of the gas disk and the deviation fraction @xmath10 of the gas velocity from the keplerian velocity .",
    "the @xmath4 value derived in this paper gives the minimum dust abundance required for sgi , because we consider only turbulence induced in the dust layer .",
    "if turbulence were caused by another mechanism such as magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) of the gas disk , @xmath2 would be larger than the value we adopted , and consequently the required value of @xmath4 would increase .",
    "hence , @xmath4 derived in this paper is considered as the minimum value required for sgi in realistic disks .",
    "we consider a protoplanetary disk initially in a laminar flow state . sedimentation of dust particles to the midplane of the disk induces turbulence via kh or streaming instabilities caused by velocity differences between the dust and gas .",
    "a ( quasi-)steady dust layer forms when turbulent diffusion matches dust settling , in which steady state turbulence is maintained .",
    "we neglect intermittency of turbulence .",
    "if an extra source of turbulence is present such as global turbulence of the gas disk via mri , the turbulence would be stronger than that excited only by the dust - gas velocity difference .",
    "thus , in this paper , we consider the minimum strength of turbulence .",
    "the dust particles are characterized by their stopping time @xmath11 , which is the timescale of damping the velocity difference from the gas .",
    "we define the non - dimensional stopping time , @xmath12 , normalized by the keplerian frequency @xmath13 . in this study , we focus on the dynamics of relatively small particles such that @xmath14",
    ". particles with @xmath15 experience high speed collisions and the fastest radial drift , which likely hinder particle growth .",
    "sgi of the dust layer is a possible route for directly forming large bodies ( @xmath16 ) from small particles ( @xmath17 ) .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we compare the growth time of sgi with the orbital drift time of the dust particles due to gas drag in order to determine the condition for sgi to be a relevant process for planetesimal formation .      in his equation",
    "( 51 ) , y11 shows that the growth time of sgi for small particles with @xmath14 , normalized by the keplerian time @xmath18 , is @xmath19 here @xmath2 is the turbulent diffusion parameter ( see below ) , @xmath5 is the toomre stability parameter of the gas disk , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sound speed of the gas , @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath23 is the surface density of the gas disk . the disk `` metallicity '' @xmath9 is the ratio of the surface densities between the dust and gas , @xmath24 .",
    "the growth time depends on the turbulent diffusion parameter @xmath2 through its stabilizing effect for perturbations with short wavelengths .",
    "turbulence in the dust layer is induced by velocity differences between the dust and gas .",

    "t12 shows that the dust particles accrete toward the star due to gas drag and supply energy to turbulence via kh and/or streaming instabilities .",
    "dust accretion is either caused by the gas drag acting on individual particles or by turbulent drag acting on the surface of the dust layer .",
    "the former ( individual drag ) is effective if the dust - to - gas ratio at the disk midplane , @xmath35 , is less than unity , and the latter ( collective drag ) is effective if @xmath36 .",
