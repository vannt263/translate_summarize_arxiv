    "flows around solid bodies have been investigated in a wide variety of fields in science and engineering .",
    "computational fluid dynamics has advantages in both visualizing flow fields and providing detailed data over experiments .",
    "the flows around solid objects are often calculated using either a body - fitted grid system to impose boundary conditions or a set of appropriate orthogonal functions which satisfy the boundary conditions to expand the flow variables . however",
    ", if there exist complex - shaped solid bodies or bodies which move or deform in the flow , it is not easy to generate a body - fitted grid system or to find a set of orthogonal functions ; efficient computation is not possible at low cost by these methods .",
    "the volume penalization ( vp ) method is one of the alternative methods to simulate flows in these complicated situations .",
    "the vp method is one of the immersed boundary methods which are classified into two types : _ the continuous forcing approach _ in which an external force term is added to a continuous equation of motion and _ the discrete forcing approach _ in which the force term is added to a discretized one@xcite .",
    "the vp method is the former type .",
    "one can use it with the fourier pseudo - spectral method ; many flows in which multiple solid bodies exist @xcite , the flows inside rigid boundaries @xcite , and the flows around moving bodies @xcite have been simulated by the vp method . moreover , the vp method can be used with chebyshev pseudo - spectral method , wavelet solvers , and other high - precision methods@xcite .    in the vp method ,",
    "a solid body is regarded as porous medium of low permeability .",
    "there are two types of penalization modeling .",
    "one is the @xmath3 penalization : the navier - stokes ( n - s ) equation is converted to the darcy equation in the solid body ; and the other is the @xmath4 penalization : the n - s equation is transformed to the brinkman equation in the solid body @xcite . in the @xmath3 penalization , a damping force term which is called a penalization term and has a mask function @xmath5 and the permeability @xmath2 is added to the equation of motion .",
    "usually the step function , which is @xmath6 in the fluid region and @xmath7 in the solid region , is chosen as @xmath5 .",
    "the mask function activates the penalization term in the solid region so that the penalized n - s equation turns into the darcy equation .",
    "one of the advantages of the vp method is that there are rigorous results about convergence .",
    "as permeability tends to zero , the penalized solution converges to the solution of the original ( non penalized ) problem with dirichlet - type boundary conditions , e.g. no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "proved mathematically that the upper bound for the difference between the solutions of the original and penalized n - s equations , is @xmath8 in the fluid region@xcite .",
    "this upper bound is improved to @xmath9 by carbou and fabrie@xcite .",
    "kevlahan and ghidaglia@xcite considered a stokes flow over a flat plate whose dynamics is reduced to the one - dimensional diffusion equation and showed analytically that the error between the original and penalized solutions is @xmath9 in the fluid region .",
    "recently , kadoch _ et al .",
    "_ applied the vp method to problems with neumann - type boundary conditions , e.g. no - flux conditions@xcite .",
    "they draw the same conclusion as carbou and fabrie@xcite in the convergence property .",
    "these results suggest that in principle the error derived from the penalization term can be smaller than the discretization error by choosing sufficiently small @xmath2 with a fine grid which can resolve the internal boundary layer . however , we can not always choose a sufficiently small value for @xmath2 when an explicit method is used for time development .",
    "the relation @xmath10 should be fulfilled in order to ensure numerical stability , where @xmath11 is the time step and @xmath12 is a constant which depends on the method of time integration . in this paper a new approach for reducing the numerical error in the penalization method is proposed , which is effective in the range of relatively large @xmath2 for a moderately small value of @xmath1 so that the vp method can be used with high accuracy even if the explicit method is used for time integration .",
    "the results are verified for the problems of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) diffusion equation , burgers equation , and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) n - s equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 we mention the modification of the mask function on the basis of the analytical solution of 1d diffusion equation .",
    "next , we apply it to a 1d problem of burgers equation in section 3 , and to a 2d problem of n - s equation in section 4 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 5 .",
    "first , we derive _ shift length _ which is a parameter of changing the mask function to reduce the numerical error in the penalization method , based on the analytical solution of the 1d diffusion equation with a penalization term .",
    "next , we confirm the effect of error reduction numerically by solving the 1d diffusion equation .",
    "first we consider the initial value problem of the 1d diffusion equation @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient . given the initial value @xmath14",
    "the exact solution can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the initial amplitude , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the wavenumber of the 1d diffusion equation , and @xmath19 is the location of the interface between fluid and solid regions .",

    "the total error decreases as @xmath61 increases showing the second - order accuracy for the shifted mask functions , while it converges to a constant value for large @xmath61 for the original mask functions .",
    "moreover , the error is much more reduced for large @xmath2 .",
    "it is the same feature as that for the 1d diffusion and burgers equations ( figs .",
    "[ fig_errdiff1db ] and [ fig_errburg1db ] ) .",
    "this result shows that our new method for error reduction is also effective for the 2d n - s equations .",
    "the solutions in the whole region , near the inner boundary , and near the outer boundary are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_velns2d ] .",
    "the taylor - couette flow is well resolved by the pseudo - spectral method ( fig .",
    "[ fig_velns2d]a ) .",
    "looking at the vicinity of the inner and outer cylinders , however , we observe some differences between the numerical and the exact solutions ( figs .  [ fig_velns2d]b and c ) .",
    "the results obtained by the original type mask function are smaller / larger than the exact solution near the inner / outer boundary . by shifting the mask function toward the fluid region by @xmath0 ,",
    "the numerical solution agrees well with the exact solution in the fluid region except for the immediate vicinity of the cylinders .",
    "these features are exactly the same as those of the 1d diffusion and burgers equation .",
    "in addition , the radial distributions for @xmath186 and @xmath187 are in good agreement for @xmath188 .",
    "thus , if the grid resolution is high enough to capture the boundary layer , the effect of error reduction is independent of the angle for large @xmath61 , although the grid system is not spherically symmetric .",
    "we have investigated the error of the volume penalization method , and have proposed a new method for reducing the error due to the penalization term .",
    "our findings are summarized below .",
    "first , we found that the mask function type b , for which the boundary is located at the midpoint of the grid points where the mask function jumps from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , makes the numerical penalized solutions converge to the exact penalized solutions with highest order .",
    "next , we modified the mask function in order to reduce the numerical error in the volume penalization method .",
    "our new idea is to shift the boundary between fluid and solid regions of the mask function toward the fluid region by @xmath0 .",
    "the modified mask function makes the total error , which is defined as the difference between the numerical solution and the exact solution , decrease as @xmath61 increases .",
    "if the leaking area , whose size is @xmath0 , in the solid region should be adequately resolved for given @xmath61 , this technique is effective for comparatively large @xmath2 .",
    "thus it is useful when the explicit method is used for time integration because of the condition for numerical stability @xmath189 .",
    "then , we performed numerical simulations of the one - dimensional nonlinear burgers equation and the two - dimensional navier - stokes equations to confirm the applicability of the present method .",
    "the results showed that modifying the mask function is also effective for the one - dimensional nonlinear problem and the two - dimensional incompressible flow problem of the taylor - couette flow between two co - axial cylinders even if circular solid boundaries are immersed in the cartesian grids .",
    "therefore , it would be valid for various governing equations , spatial discretization methods , and multi - dimensional problems",
    ".    there are several conditions for permeability @xmath2 , some of which are mentioned above : ( i ) time resolution : response time @xmath2 should be smaller than the smallest time scale which should be resolved ; ( ii ) spatial resolution : the `` surface thickness '' @xmath0 should be smaller than the smallest length scale which should be resolved ; ( iii ) resolution at the boundaries : the grid spacing should be smaller than @xmath0 to resolve the surface `` layer '' at the boundaries ; ( iv ) numerical stability for explicit time integration : @xmath189 . the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are necessary , while ( iii ) is optional and ( iv ) is irrelevant when an implicit method is used for time integration .    in this study , we did not discuss the applicability of our error reduction method to the non - uniform grids and moving or deforming solid boundaries .",
    "furthermore , we did not deal with continuous mask functions@xcite .",
    "these problems are important for development of the volume penalization method and will be investigated as future works .",
