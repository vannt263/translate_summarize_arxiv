    "microtubule ( mt ) dynamics is essential for many cellular processes , such as cell division @xcite , intracellular positioning processes @xcite , e.g.   positioning of the cell nucleus @xcite or chromosomes during mitosis , establishing cell polarity @xcite , or regulation of cell shapes @xcite .",
    "an important feature of mt dynamics is their dynamic instability , which is the stochastic switching between phases of growth and rapid shrinkage @xcite .",
    "polymerization phases terminate in catastrophes , where the mt switches to a state of rapid depolymerization .",
    "depolymerization phases are terminated by rescue events , in which the mt switches back into a growing state .",
    "the dynamic instability is closely linked to the hydrolysis of tubulin dimers : mt catastrophe events are associated with the loss of the stabilizing gtp - cap through hydrolysis to gdp - tubulin within the mt .",
    "the depolymerization rate of gdp - tubulin dimers is significantly higher than the depolymerization rate of gtp - dimers .",
    "however , catastrophes are more than phases of rapid depolymerization of the gdp - cap of a mt .",
    "this is strongly suggested by conformational changes and mechanical forces occurring during catastrophes : ( i ) in a mt catastrophe the protofilaments of mt fall apart and curl into characteristic `` ram s horn '' conformations @xcite ; ( ii ) depolymerizing mts can exert forces , which are important in mitosis if chromosomes are separated @xcite .",
    "the curling into ram s horns is caused by a spontaneous curvature of gdp - tubulin dimers .",
    "this means hydrolysis gives rise to changes in the tubulin dimer conformation or the mt structure .",
    "two different models have been discussed in the literature to describe the influence of hydrolysis on the mechanics of the mt , the allosteric model @xcite and the lattice model @xcite . in the allosteric model , inter - dimer or intra - dimer bending angles change during hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "hydrolysis of a tubulin dimer changes one or both of these angles @xcite . if it is assumed that hydrolysis mainly changes the intra - dimer angle , this angle increases from @xmath0 for straight gtp - dimers to @xmath1 for curved gdp - dimers @xcite . in the lattice model ,",
    "both states of the tubulin dimers are slightly bent and hydrolysis weakens the lateral interaction strength between dimers in neighboring protofilaments @xcite . at present , the experimental evidence is not sufficient to rule out any of the two models .",
    "also combinations of both models are possible , where hydrolysis affects both the intra - dimer angle ( allosteric ) and the interaction strength between laterally neighboring dimers ( lattice ) .",
    "the influence of tubulin dimer hydrolysis onto the mechanics of the mt lattice suggests that , vice versa , mechanical forces and torques acting on tubulin dimers or the mt structure also affect hydrolysis rates .",
    "this effect has not been considered in the literature before , and we will use the allosteric model with intra - dimer bending to study this coupling of hydrolysis and mt mechanics .",
    "similar investigations should be done in the future for the lattice model .",
    "moreover , recent experiments also suggest that catastrophes are initiated in a multi - step process , which involves not a single rate - limiting event but a chain of at least two events , which are probably related to hydrolysis events @xcite .",
    "mechanical forces might be one possible way to orchestrate such a chain of hydrolysis events .",
    "our results on the influence of mt mechanics on the hydrolysis pathway will give hints on the mechanism of catastrophe initiation .",
    "there are numerous models for the growth dynamics of mts , which either ignore catastrophe events and focus on the growing phase of mt dynamics @xcite , or which include catastrophes as explicit stochastic switching events on a macroscopic level following @xcite .",
    "these approaches include details of the hydrolysis mechanism into the model for the catastrophe rate @xcite .",
    "one focus of these approaches was the explanation of the behavior of mt growth dynamics under force .",
    "in this paper , we want to concentrate on the coupling of hydrolysis events to mt mechanics .",
    "we will ignore the polymerization dynamics for simplicity and consider hydrolysis in mts of fixed length without any external forces . in the end",
    ", we try to develop a microscopic model for the initiation of catastrophes based on hydrolysis events coupled to the mechanics of the mt lattice and additional rupture events within the mt lattice .",
    "this means that we will not include catastrophes as explicit stochastic events but obtain catastrophes as emerging events from hydrolysis coupled to mechanics within the mt",
    ". our description will be microscopic on the level of tubulin dimers ( i.e. , not on the level of all - atom simulations as in @xcite ) .",
    "there exist already various models describing the stochastic dynamics of hydrolysis and the mechanics of mts on the dimer level .",
    "they can be classified into different categories :    \\(i ) there are purely `` chemical '' models not taking into account the mechanics of the mt lattice but only including chemical rate constants for addition and removal of tubulin dimers and hydrolysis rates @xcite . in these chemical models ,",
    "phases of accelerated depolymerization can be observed if the cap mainly consists of gdp - tubulin .",
    "these phases of fast depolymerization are identified with catastrophe events .",
    "different hydrolysis mechanisms such as random @xcite , vectorial @xcite , or mixed cooperative mechanisms @xcite are possible and have been discussed , but this issue is not settled for microtubules @xcite . the model proposed by flyvbjerg @xcite including both random and vectorial mechanisms in a cooperative mechanism has been successfully applied to fit catastrophe rates from the resulting first - passage statistics to zero gtp - cap length .",
    "the results suggest a strongly cooperative mechanism with mostly vectorial hydrolysis and a fairly small random component",
    ". however , if the results of @xcite for the resulting gtp - cap length are used , the strong cooperativity leads to rather large gtp - caps as compared to experimental findings of up to 3 layers of gtp - tubulin @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , a weakly cooperative mechanism with mostly random hydrolysis is found to describe experimental data on catastrophe rates best . in @xcite ,",
    "a random hydrolysis mechanism has been successfully used to model typical mt length fluctuations on the nanometer scale . in @xcite ,",
    "a coupled - random hydrolysis mechanism has been proposed , where the plus end gtp - dimer can not hydrolyze but only dissociate .",
    "one advantage of many chemical models is that exact or , at least , approximative analytical results can be found @xcite , for example , for catastrophe frequencies , which can be easily compared to experimental data .",
    "\\(ii ) chemical models also differ with respect to protofilament substructure . in some models",
    "the 13 protofilament substructure is ignored @xcite , more detailed models contain all 13 protofilaments explicitly @xcite .",
    "some of these more detailed `` chemical '' models also include a possible influence of the neighboring protofilament state on hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "however , all of these models still deal with strictly rigid mts .",
    "\\(iii ) furthermore , there are purely `` mechanical '' models on the level of single dimers , which include the possible bending of protofilaments and binding interaction between neighboring protofilaments @xcite , but do not model their influence onto chemical hydrolysis or polymerization rates .",
    "\\(iv ) only the model proposed in @xcite couples chemical and mechanical aspects of the mt lattice and considers the influence of mechanics on polymerization and depolymerization rates .    in all of these models ,",
    "the interplay of mechanical forces and hydrolysis remains unaddressed so far .",
    "in this paper , we will add this aspect and focus on the influence of mechanical forces onto hydrolysis rates and its consequences for hydrolysis pathways and the initiation of catastrophe events .",

    ", we will employ the so - called allosteric model and assume that gtp - tubulin dimers are straight and assemble into straight protofilaments , whereas gdp - tubulin tends to form curved protofilaments with curvature radius @xmath6 in the typical ram s horn configurations @xcite .",
    "protofilament curvature can be caused both by inter- and intra - dimer bending @xcite .",
    "if we assume that there is only intra - dimer bending during hydrolysis , a gdp - dimer acquires a bent configuration with an equilibrium angle of @xmath1 . the tube formed by the 13 protofilaments",
    "is stabilized by lateral bonds between tubulin dimers in neighboring protofilaments .",
    "these bonds are assumed to be identical for gtp- and gdp - dimer within the allosteric model .",
    "gtp - tubulin assembles into protofilaments ( i.e. , has a high polymerization rate and a low depolymerization rate ) , whereas gdp - tubulin tends to disassemble ( i.e. , has a depolymerization rate much higher than the polymerization rate ) @xcite . within the mt protofilaments",
    ", gtp - tubulin is hydrolyzed into gdp - tubulin after a certain waiting time depending on the exact hydrolysis mechanism and hydrolysis rates .",
    "this gives rise to mts consisting of an unhydrolyzed gtp - cap at the growing end and hydrolyzed gdp - tubulin behind this cap .",
    "comparison of recent experimental measurements of mt length fluctuations on the nanometer scale and a random hydrolysis model suggests a cap size of @xmath7 gtp - dimers corresponding to 3 layers of gdp - dimers @xcite . the structure of the cap will depend on the hydrolysis mechanism . for _ random _ hydrolysis , where dimers hydrolyze completely independent from each other @xcite ,",
    "the cap boundary is not sharp ( in the sense that there are many gtp-/gdp - boundaries in the cap region ) with an exponentially decaying gtp - tubulin concentration .",
    "for a _ vectorial _ mechanism , where hydrolysis propagates as a `` wave '' because hydrolysis can only happen if the neighboring dimer is already in its hydrolyzed gdp - state @xcite , the cap boundary is sharp by definition . for _ cooperative _ models incorporating both mechanisms @xcite",
    ", we get a cap structure consisting of many gtp - islands with a characteristic dependence of the island size distribution and cap size on the cooperativity parameter @xcite .    because gtp - tubulin dimers are straight",
    ", they stabilize the mt as they do not stress lateral bonds between protofilaments .",
    "intrinsically curved gdp - dimers , on the other hand , stress the lateral bonds and destabilize the mt lattice . in the following , we consider a mt with a fixed length , a stabilizing gtp - cap of fixed size and with a sharp cap boundary for simplicity ( typically 3 layers of gtp - dimers ) .",
    "we formulate a mechanical model , which ( i ) incorporates dimer bending and lateral bonds between neighboring protofilaments , ( ii ) gives mechanically stable tubular structures in agreement with experimentally observe mt structures , and ( iii ) is as simple as possible .",

    "we only allow for intra - dimer bending at the @xmath2-junction within each dimer , see figure [ fig : mt_def]a .",
    "the mt conformation is then described by bending angles of the @xmath2-dimer in the @xmath18 protofilament ( @xmath19 ) in the @xmath20 layer , where @xmath21 corresponds to the gtp - capped mt end and @xmath22 to the gdp - end , see figure [ fig : mt_def]b .",
    "we only allow for intra - dimer bending and regard the inter - dimer bonds as straight and fixed .    for the mathematical description , we can then group the @xmath5-tubulin in layer @xmath23 with the @xmath24-tubulin in layer @xmath25 into a straight `` rod '' @xmath25 oriented with angle @xmath11 in protofilament @xmath26 . in the following we will describe the mt configuration in terms of these rods , as shown in figure [ fig : mt_def]a .",

    "thus , the ending position @xmath41 of the @xmath18 rod in the @xmath20 layer is given by @xmath42 we assume that dimers or rods can only be displaced in radial direction , i.e. , all polar angles @xmath43 are fixed and independent of the layer number @xmath25 .",
    "the azimuth angles @xmath11 of rods describe the radial displacements of dimers and are the configurational variables that are determined by mechanical energy minimization .",
    "we consider mt configurations that contain @xmath44 complete layers of hydrolyzed gdp - tubulin and @xmath45 complete layers of gtp - tubulin ( @xmath46 ) ; we focus on 4 layer gtp - caps with @xmath47 . in accordance to the allosteric model we assume gtp - dimers to be straight with an equilibrium angle @xmath48 and gdp - tubulin bent with an equilibrium angle @xmath49 .",
    "we consider deviations from these preferred equilibrium angles to be governed by an elastic bending energy with a characteristic bending rigidity @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we define the longitudinal bending energy stored in the mt lattice as @xmath51 with @xmath52 fixed and the bending rigidity @xmath50 of individual tubulin dimers .    to obtain a tubular structure , we have to introduce lateral bonding .",
    "a reasonable and simple assumption is that only dimers in neighboring protofilaments interact laterally ( reminiscent of some form of molecular bonds forming ) .",
    "mechanical stability will require to introduce two contributions to these lateral interactions : one attractive binding contribution in form of a harmonic bond with a finite rest length and an additional hard - core - like repulsion , which basically prevents configurations with interpenetrating dimers .    for the attractive binding contribution , we assume that neighboring tubulin dimers interact via bonds between specific interaction points on the surface of the dimers .",
    "we use only one lateral bond per dimer , i.e. , each dimer or each rod has two interaction points , which we locate on the surface at the top of each rod , see figure [ fig : mt_def]a .",

    "the rest length @xmath34 can be determined by geometry ; with the mean radius @xmath55 and assuming spherical tubulin monomers of radius @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath56 \\simeq 1.14 { \\rm nm}. \\label{eq : l0}\\ ] ]    if the equilibrium angle @xmath12 of a tubulin dimer changes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 by hydrolysis , this will strain the lateral bonds in the mt lattice . because the interaction points for lateral bonds are located at the top of each rod ( or at mid - height of each dimer , see figure [ fig : mt_def]a ) , hydrolysis of the last @xmath5-tubulin monomer of the last tubulin dimer at the plus end ( @xmath21 ) does _ not _ strain the last bond .",
    "therefore , the hydrolysis state of the tubulin dimers at the plus end of each protofilament at @xmath21 will have no effect on mt mechanics in our model .",
    "if we consider mt - configurations with gtp - caps consisting of @xmath45 complete layers of gtp - tubulin , only @xmath57 gtp - layers have an effect on mt mechanics .",
    "we therefore ignore the last layer of @xmath5-tubulin monomers at the plus end in the following , in particular in the mt hydrolysis patterns shown in figures [ fig : hp_random_05 ]  [ fig : hp_vec_0005 ] below .",
    "we point out that the last tubulin layer has a stabilizing effect also in our model as the stabilizing lateral bonds are contained in our model ( at the top of the last rod , see figure [ fig : mt_def]a ) . however , this stabilizing effect is independent of the hydrolysis state of the last layer and only depends on the hydrolysis states of the layers below .",
    "this point of view can be further justified because gtp - dimers at the plus end can not hydrolyze as the last @xmath5-monomer has no inter - dimer contact @xcite .",
    "in addition to the attractive lateral binding forces , we apply a strongly repulsive hard core interaction to avoid overlapping of tubulin dimers , which we model by a @xmath58-potential .",

    "no direct experimental measurement of the microscopic mechanical parameters @xmath54 and @xmath50 is available so far . however , there are a number of experiments determining the macroscopic elastic moduli of the mt lattice which could be related to the microscopic mechanical parameters .",

    "the shear energy per dimer is @xmath73 with the distance @xmath74 between neighboring protofilament centers ( where @xmath55 is the mean of outer and inner tube radius ) . in order to calculate the shear energy of the mt lattice properly",

    "one important point regarding the influence of the mechanics of the mt lattice onto the hydrolysis rates is the following : _ differences _ between hydrolysis rates at different sites in the mt lattice are not governed by @xmath124 , which is identical for all mt lattices sites , but rather by the mechanical contribution @xmath130 to the barrier , which we want to estimate now .",
    "we know that the total mechanical energy is a quadratic function of @xmath117 via the bending energy contribution in ( [ eq : long_int ] ) . in order to determine @xmath130 for hydrolysis we have to increase @xmath117 from @xmath0 to @xmath126 to obtain the saddle point value @xmath130 .",
    "because we assume that a single hydrolysis reaction is faster than mechanical relaxation of the mt lattice , we increase @xmath117 for _ fixed _ values of the configuration angles @xmath11 .",

    ", @xmath130 will be small ( eventually even negative ) for hydrolysis of a given dimer if there are mechanical forces in the mt lattice that pull the dimer into its bent gdp - configuration .",
    "this mechanical shift of the free energy barrier for the hydrolysis reaction will modulate the hydrolysis rate @xmath136 of a dimer according to @xmath137 following bell @xcite .",
    "in particular , this leads to _ site - dependent _ hydrolysis rates , which depend on the position of the dimer in the mt lattice via the mechanical forces acting on it at that position .",
    "we conclude that the interaction via the mechanics of the mt lattice can give rise to possible correlation effects in the hydrolysis dynamics , which have not been taken into account before .",
    "our simulation algorithm for the most probable hydrolysis pathway ( see section [ sec : hydrolysis_path ] below ) will be based on two assumptions regarding the time scales for hydrolysis and mechanical relaxation : ( i ) a single hydrolysis reaction is fast compared to mechanical relaxation , which was the basis for calculating the modulated hydrolysis rate ( [ eq : rdeltae ] ) , and ( ii ) mechanical relaxation is faster than the time _ between _ successive hydrolysis events ( set by the hydrolysis rate @xmath138 ) such that we relax the mt lattice mechanically between successive hydrolysis events .      within the mt gtp - dimers",

    "if hydrolysis is mechanically dominated ( @xmath152 ) , the hydrolysis pathways , i.e. , the order of hydrolysis of dimers within the mt , is mainly determined by the mechanical shift @xmath130 of the energy barrier for the hydrolysis reaction : the dimer to be hydrolyzed next with highest probability is the gtp - dimer with the smallest @xmath130 among all gtp - dimers accessible by the hydrolysis mechanism . for random hydrolysis",

    "these different catastrophe characteristics for vectorial and random hydrolysis could be an interesting issue for future experimental studies .",
    "we introduced a mechanical model , which gives stable tubular mt structures if a stabilizing gtp - cap is present in accordance with experimental observations .",
    "the model includes intra - dimer bending and one lateral bond per dimer . in order to avoid overlapping of tubulin dimers",
    "we also include a sufficiently strong hard core interaction .",
    "we use the allosteric model for the hydrolysis state of tubulin dimers : gtp dimers are straight ; after hydrolysis , a gdp dimer has an equilibrium bending angle of @xmath1 .",
    "we obtained several constraints for the model parameters , the bending rigidity @xmath50 and the lateral bond strength @xmath54 : ( i ) the ratio @xmath65 is constrained by a lower bound @xmath220 , see ( [ eq : klowerbound ] ) , which ensures that gtp - capped mts do not spontaneously acquire a strongly bent shape similar to the ram s horn configuration .",
    "( ii ) the value for @xmath50 is constrained by an upper bound ( [ eq : kappa_upperbound ] ) because hydrolysis is not observed to be a reversible reaction and the free energy released in hydrolysis should exceed the mechanical energy increase in the mt lattice during hydrolysis .",
    "( iii ) if we additionally assume that hydrolysis is dominated by mechanical forces in the mt lattice , i.e. , typical mechanical energy changes of the the mt lattice during hydrolysis exceed the thermal energy @xmath221 , the value for @xmath50 is also constrained by a lower bound ( [ eq : kappa_lowerbound ] ) . the bounds ( ii ) and ( iii ) define a range @xmath159 of dimer bending rigidities .",
    "the mechanical model allows us to investigate the interplay of mechanical forces in the mt lattice and hydrolysis , which has not been done previously .",
    "the interaction via the mechanics of the mt lattice can give rise to possible correlation effects in the hydrolysis dynamics , which have not been taken into account before .",
    "under the assumption of a mechanically dominated hydrolysis reaction the concept of a _ most probable hydrolysis pathway _ becomes very useful .",
    "we calculated most probable hydrolysis pathways numerically both for random hydrolysis ( figures [ fig : hp_random_05 ] and [ fig : hp_random_0005 ] ) , where all gtp - dimers in the mt cap can be hydrolyzed , and for vectorial hydrolysis ( figures [ fig : hp_vec_05 ] and [ fig : hp_vec_0005 ] ) , where only gtp - dimers at the gtp - gdp interface can be hydrolyzed .",
    "we also studied the effect of lateral bond strength on the hydrolysis pathway .    for mechanically dominated random hydrolysis",
    ", the most probable hydrolysis pathway shows a preference for layer - by - layer hydrolysis starting at the gtp - layer at the plus end . for mechanically dominated vectorial hydrolysis , the most probable hydrolysis pathway shows a preference for hydrolysing complete protofilaments towards the plus end starting from a certain `` nucleus '' configuration consisting of three neighboring hydrolyzed gdp - dimers within the same layer .",
    "this could be related to the experimental observation of several rate - limiting steps for catastrophe initiation @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the lateral bond forces occurring during hydrolysis . for random hydrolysis , mechanically dominated hydrolysis proceeds in a layer - by - layer fashion starting at the plus end , and we found sharp increases of the maximal lateral bond force if hydrolysis of one layer has been completed and hydrolysis of the next layer starts .",
    "the respective maximal forces occur at the plus end of the mt . for vectorial hydrolysis and weak lateral bonds",
    ", we found a sharp increase of the maximal lateral bond force if a single protofilament becomes completely hydrolyzed . for stronger lateral bonds ,",
    "several protofilaments need to become completely hydrolyzed to trigger a similar increase in the maximal lateral bond force .",
    "the respective maximal forces occur right at the plus end .",
    "moreover , we observe that the mt lattice becomes mechanically unstable at the sharp increase : rupture of the maximally strained bond further _",
    "increases _ the maximal bond force , which signals an instability with respect to a catastrophe event initiated by lateral bond rupture . if the rupture force value lies within the force range set by the sharp increase of the maximal lateral bond force , we indeed find continued bond rupture and catastrophe events as observed in experiments , see figures [ fig : catastrophe_vec ] and [ fig : catastrophe_random ] . using this criterion we find rupture force values between 1pn for weak and 5pn for strong lateral bonds . for vectorial hydrolysis , we find catastrophes starting with single protofilaments peeling off the mt . for random hydrolysis , on the other hand , we typically see several protofilaments peeling off the mt .",
    "these characteristic differences in our simulations could motivate further experimental studies of this issue .",
    "our results suggest several routes for future work .",
    "firstly , we only studied mts of fixed length for simplicity .",
    "further investigations will include stochastic polymerization and depolymerization similar to the models in @xcite .",
    "secondly , we assumed so far that hydrolysis is mechanically dominated and forces on the most probable hydrolysis pathway by selecting the next gtp - dimer to be hydrolyzed according to the maximal mechanical energy gain .",
    "future models should be fully stochastic with hydrolysis rates _ modulated _ by mechanical energies in order to include all hydrolysis pathways with their respective statistical weight into the analysis .",
    "finally , a similar mechanical mt model and its coupling to hydrolysis should be investigated not only for the allosteric model but also for the lattice model of dimer hydrolysis .",
    "we thank bjrn zelinski and sebastian knoche for fruitful discussions , and we acknowledge support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( ki 662/4 - 1 ) ."
