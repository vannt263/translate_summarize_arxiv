    "7 ) , shown as the fermi surfaces below @xmath88 by 0.1  ev for @xmath36 = sb . looking at our fig .",
    "[ btao_bands ] , we observe that the fermi level seems to be approaching down toward the dos peak as @xmath36 changes from bi and sb to as . this can be regarded as if @xmath88 effectively behaves like the sea - level down @xmath36 = as with a fixed landscape of @xmath36 = sb .",

    "7 by singh _",
    "et al._. @xcite the fixed landscape , namely the rigid band picture near to fermi level , can be justified to some extent because they are mainly composed of ti-@xmath24 orbital contributions as shown in fig .",
    "[ btao_bands ] .",
    "the reason why the sea - level gets down when @xmath36 is substituted into as can roughly be accounted as follows : as a rough estimation of how @xmath36 affects to shift @xmath88 , we can start with its homo level of the isolated atom [ homo stands for highest occupied molecular orbital though the orbitals in the present context is not molecular but isolated atomic orbital .",
    "we use homo rather than hoao just because the latter is not so commonly spread abbreviation .",
    "we expect this does nt matter so much even it is used for isolated atom . ] .",
    "namely , a negatively deeper homo would contribute to attract ti - electrons more strongly and make @xmath88 lower . noticing the deeper homo corresponds to the larger ionic potential",
    ", we expect that the lighter element ( as ) has deeper homo because the potential is enhanced by the less screening of the nucleus attractions by fewer inner electrons .",
    "@xcite the deeper homo also corresponds to the larger electronegativity , which is actually 2.18 for as while 2.05 ( 2.02 ) for sb ( bi ) by pauling scale .",
    "similar negativities for sb and bi can account for the common nesting vectors of these compounds , being different from that of as . summarizing the above , the negatively deeper homo level of as can attract ti - electrons more strongly and effectively push @xmath88 down when it forms pnictides , and then the fermi surface changes to get flattened nose as depicted in fig .",

    ". there exists , however , such quasi 2d systems  @xcite where their superlattice instabilities can clearly be explained by the nesting vectors . to investigate if our system corresponds to which case or that lying in between , it is quite intriguing to analyze @xmath92 for @xmath36 = as , but unfortunately we can not perform any of such phonon calculations under the perfect disappearance of imaginary frequencies because of too costly calculations for the @xmath65 superlattice .",
