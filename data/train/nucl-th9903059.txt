    "the main focus of klaus  work during the last years of his life was the event generator vni which describes relativistic heavy - ion collisions and high energy particle collisions in terms of a perturbative parton shower monte carlo in phase - space combined with a simple space - time hadronization prescription .",
    "a partonic starting point is certainly required at ultrarelativistic collision energies , @xmath0 gev , where perturbative contributions start to account for a significant part of the measured particle production . with his parton cascade model @xcite ,",
    "later amended by a space - time hadronization algorithm @xcite and made publicly available in form of the event generator vni @xcite , klaus geiger led the way .    from summer 1997 until klaus  death we collaborated with him and john ellis on implementing an afterburner for bose - einstein correlations into this code and testing it in simulations for @xmath1 collisions at lepi and lepii collisions .",
    "our goal was to prepare for an experimental test of the space - time dynamics predicted by vni and to provide theoretical guidance for multi - dimensional bose - einstein analyses of various event classes with hadronic final states generated at lep .",
    "this work @xcite was interrupted prematurely ; our contribution gives an account of the present status .",
    "vni distinguishes itself from many other high energy event monte carlos by following the event history in phase - space , not only in momentum space .",
    "_ space - time aspects _ enter in the numerical simulation in various ways : on the _ microscopic _ level , the rescattering between produced partons or hadrons is controlled by geometric cross sections , and hadronization is modelled geometrically by requiring partons to get ( in their pair rest frame ) closer than 0.8 fm in coordinate space in order to form a hadronic cluster . on a _ macroscopic _ level this leads to a strong density dependence of particle production and absorption rates , further affected by the collective expansion of the system which is generated by the rescattering .",
    "finally , quantum statistical effects among the produced final state particles , in particular bose - einstein correlations in momentum space between pairs of identical pions or kaons , depend on the _ phase - space density _ of the system at the point of decoupling and thus on both the momentum - space and space - time structure of the event at `` freeze - out '' ( i.e. at the point of the last strong interaction between the particles ) .    in this sense all measured quantities in a heavy - ion collision",
    "depend to some extent on the space - time structure of the reaction zone .",
    "the crucial question is , however , whether they are sufficiently sensitive to such aspects to allow for a reconstruction of the space - time geometry and dynamics .",
    "the successful reproduction of single - particle yields and spectra by event generators with different space - time features , or none at all like the popular jetset @xcite and pythia @xcite generators , seems to argue against such a possibility .",
    "two - particle correlations in momentum space , however , are sensitive to both the geometric extension of the `` fireball '' at freeze - out and to its collective expansion dynamics @xcite .",
    "the latter affects the two - particle spectra via so - called `` @xmath2-@xmath3-correlations '' in the emission function @xmath4 .",
    "this function is the quantum mechanical analogue of the single - particle phase - space density of the source at freeze - out : collective expansion correlates the average direction and magnitude of the momenta of the emitted particles with their emission points . a detailed analysis of 2-pion and 2-kaon correlations in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the brookhaven ags and the cern sps has recently led to an unambiguous demonstration of strong collective dynamics of the fireballs created in these experiments @xcite . on a finer level",
    ", however , there remain a number of open physical questions whose resolution requires two - particle correlation data of similar quality and detail from elementary particle collisions .",
    "such data do not exist , and another motivation for our work with klaus geiger was therefore to provide stimulation for similar experimental analyses of high - statistics high energy data samples like the @xmath5 million hadronic @xmath6 decays collected at lepi .    for sufficiently high secondary particle multiplicities ( i.e. at very high energies or for large collision systems )",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the two particles of a selected pair were emitted independently .",
    "this allows to express the two - particle correlation function in terms of the single - particle wigner density @xmath4 of the source @xcite .",
    "neglecting final state interactions ( assuming that they can be corrected for experimentally @xcite or theoretically @xcite at a later stage ) , it is given by @xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8 are the on - shell momenta of the two particles in the pair while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are their average and relative 4-momenta .",
    "the numerator in the second term stands for the product of the measured single - particle spectra @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the normalization @xmath13 will be discussed below .",
    "if , for a given momentum @xmath14 , the space - time dependence of @xmath15 can be characterized with reasonable accuracy by a single set of rms widths ( i.e. the particle emission is not characterized by several widely differing length scales ) , one can approximate @xmath15 by a gaussian in @xmath2 .",
    "the correlation function then takes the simple form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 describes the second space - time moments ( rms widths or `` homogeneity lengths '' ) of the _ effective source _ of particles with momentum @xmath14 .",
    "since the two measured particles are on - shell , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and only 3 of the 4 components of @xmath20 are independent .",
    "different choices for the independent components lead to different gaussian parametrizations of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "we will here use the cartesian parametrization which eliminates @xmath21 where @xmath22 is ( approximately ) the velocity of the particle pair .",
    "@xmath23 is decomposed into its cartesian components @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the `` longitudinal '' direction ( in heavy - ion collisions this is the direction of the beam axis , in @xmath1 collisions the direction of the thrust axis ) , @xmath26 denotes the outward direction , fixed by the azimuthal orientation of the transverse pair momentum @xmath27 around the @xmath25-axis , and @xmath28 denotes the third cartesian ( sideward ) direction ( defined by @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .    eliminating @xmath31 from the exponent in ( [ eq3b ] ) leaves a sum over 6 terms ; using furthermore the azimuthal symmetry of the event sample around the @xmath25-axis allows to further reduce this to 4 terms involving certain algebraic sums @xcite of the rms widths @xmath17 .",
    "so far , however , bose - einstein correlations in elementary particle collisions have been parametrized by much simpler gaussian forms , involving only one or at most two ( @xmath14-independent ! ) size parameters .",
    "such incomplete parametrizations have the fundamental disadvantage that the fit parameter(s ) mix(es ) the interesting space - time information contained in the rms widths @xmath17 of the effective source of particles with momentum @xmath14 in such a way that they can no longer be recovered @xcite",
    ". an important goal of our work with klaus was to make predictions for the multidimensional shape of the correlation function @xmath32 , by calculating the complete set of size parameters and their @xmath14-dependence .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting since it signals @xmath2-@xmath14-correlations in the emission function @xmath15 .",
    "while in heavy - ion collisions the dominant mechanism for such correlations appears to be collective expansion of the fireball @xcite , contaminations from resonance decays after freeze - out @xcite and from @xmath2-@xmath3-correlations in the primary hadron formation process @xcite ( e.g. from string fragmentation ) are known to exist .",
    "the latter are expected to play a much bigger role in elementary particle collisions where a multidimensional analysis of bose - einstein correlations may help to isolate them .",
    "this would provide crucial input into a quantitative discussion of bose - einstein correlations from heavy - ion collisions where , contrary to elementary particle collisions where the multiplicities are much lower , most resonance decays can _ not _ be reconstructed experimentally and their effects must therefore be simulated .",
    "event generators like vni evolve classical _ probabilities _ , not quantum mechanical _ amplitudes _ calculated from properly symmetrized many - particle wave functions .",
    "the bose - einstein correlations among pairs of identical pions or kaons must thus be included _ a posteriori_. for notational convenience , we restrict the following discussion to a single particle species , say like - sign pions .",
    "let us assume that we have generated @xmath33 collision events , and let the @xmath34th event ( @xmath35 ) consist of @xmath36 such pions in the final state , emitted as free particles from the phase - space points @xmath37}$ ] . for @xmath33 events ,",
    "the event generator thus simulates a classical phase - space distribution @xmath38 what is needed to calculate two - particle bose - einstein correlations according to ( [ eq3 ] ) is a prescription which relates this classical phase - space density with the quantum mechanical single - particle wigner density @xmath4 of the pion source which is supposed to be monte carlo simulated by the event generator . in sections  [ sec2a ] and  [ sec2b ] , we focus on two different interpretations of the event generator output which we call `` classical '' and `` quantum '' , respectively , although these names should not distract from the fact that conceptually both are on an equal footing .",
    "each one of them leads to a different algorithm for calculating the two - particle correlation function from the event generator output : @xmath39 }      \\bigr\\rbrace_{m\\in [ 1,n_{\\rm ev } ] }      \\longrightarrow \\ c(\\bq,\\bk)\\ , ,      \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] before discussing them we list three requirements which any such algorithm should fulfill :    1 .",
    "since the event generator evolves classical probabilities , not symmetrized production amplitudes , the generated momenta @xmath40 , @xmath41 do not show the enhanced probability at low relative momenta @xmath42 characteristic for bose - einstein final state symmetrization .",
    "the prescriptions ( [ eq1 ] ) should calculate this effect a posteriori .",
    "2 .   the strength of bose - einstein correlations depends on the distance of the identical particles in phase - space , not in momentum space .",
    "we thus require the prescriptions ( [ eq1 ] ) to use the entire phase - space information , and not only the generated momentum information . ` weighting ' or ` shifting ' prescriptions which are based only on the latter @xcite",
    "may successfully match the measured momentum correlations but obviously do not allow to test the simulated space - time structure .",
    "3 .   in general , bose - einstein statistics can affect particle multiplicity distributions during the particle production process but classical event generators do not include such effects explicitly .",
    "nevertheless they are tuned to reproduce the measured average particle multiplicities @xmath43 . in order not to destroy this tuning",
    "we require that the prescription ( [ eq1 ] ) conserves the single - particle multiplicities . if the event generator were also tuned to reproduce the average multiplicity of identical particle _ pairs _",
    ", @xmath44 , i.e. to reproduce not only the mean , but also the width of the multiplicity distribution , then the prescription ( [ eq1 ] ) should not change that either . interpreting the correlator as a factor which relates the measured two - particle differential cross section to the one simulated by the event generator , @xmath45",
    ", this then implies  @xcite that @xmath46 in ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the algorithms discussed below do not satisfy this last requirement , i.e. in general they change the width of the multiplicity distribution . however , since the space - time analysis of correlation data can be based entirely on the momentum dependence of @xmath32 , irrespective of its absolute normalization , this does not matter for our purposes .      in the `` classical '' interpretation  @xcite ,",
    "the phase - space points @xmath47 are seen as a discrete approximation of the on - shell wigner phase - space density @xmath4 : @xmath48 this defines both the two - particle correlator via ( [ eq3 ] ) and the one - particle spectrum via ( [ eq3a ] ) . for a numerical implementation",
    "one must replace the momentum - space @xmath49-functions in ( [ eq2 ] ) by normalized `` bin functions '' with finite width @xmath50 of rectangular @xcite or gaussian  @xcite shape , e.g. @xmath51 which reduce to the original @xmath49-function in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "the one - particle spectrum and two - particle correlator then read @xcite @xmath53 @xmath54     \\over     \\sum_{m=1}^{n_{\\rm ev } } \\left [ \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n_m }          \\delta^{(\\epsilon)}_{\\check{\\bp}_i,\\bp_1}\\right )         \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n_m }            \\delta^{(\\epsilon)}_{\\check{\\bp}_j,\\bp_2}\\right )     - \\sum_{i=1}^{n_m } \\delta^{(\\epsilon)}_{\\check{\\bp}_i,\\bp_1 }                        \\delta^{(\\epsilon)}_{\\check{\\bp}_i,\\bp_2 }     \\right]}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq13}\\ ] ] the correlator ( [ eq13 ] ) is the discretized version of the fourier integral in ( [ eq3 ] ) . the subtracted terms in the numerator and denominator remove discretization errors which would amount to pairs constructed from the same particles .",
    "this `` classical '' algorithm , as well as the `` quantum '' version discussed below , is numerically efficient since it involves only @xmath55 manipulations per event . the calculated observables ,",
    "while being discrete functions of the input , are continuous functions of the measured momenta , i.e. no binning in @xmath56 is necessary .",
    "the `` quantum '' interpretation @xcite of the event generator output starts from the observation that , for a given event , i.e. a single term in the sum of ( [ eq2 ] ) , the simultaneous sharp definition of the particle momenta and positions at emission violates the uncertainty relation . in the limit",
    "@xmath57 the sum is still expected to be a smooth phase - space function and , to the extent that the event generator provides an accurate simulation of the underlying qcd quantum dynamics , it is also expected to respect the uncertainty constraints on any allowed wigner density . since in practice , however , one has to work with finite numbers of events , one may wish to ensure consistency with the uncertainty principle on the single - event level .",
    "this is achieved @xcite by associating the centers of single - particle wave packets with the set of generated phase - space points @xmath58 } \\rbrace_{m\\in [ 1,n_{\\rm ev}]}$ ] : @xmath59 the @xmath60 describe quantum mechanically best - localized states , i.e. they saturate the heisenberg uncertainty relation with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "taking only two - particle symmetrized contributions into account ( `` pair approximation '' @xcite ) , all spectra can be written @xcite in terms of the single - particle spectrum @xmath63 corresponding to an individual wave packet at phase - space point @xmath64 : @xmath65        \\over           \\sum_{m=1}^{n_{\\rm ev } } \\left [ \\nu_m(\\bp_1)\\ , \\nu_m(\\bp_2 )         - \\sum_{i=1}^{n_m } s_i(\\bp_1)\\,s_i(\\bp_2 ) \\right]}\\ , ,   \\label{eq6 } \\\\",

    "this algorithm is consistent with an emission function @xmath66 which is obtained by folding the classical distribution @xmath67 of wave packet centers with the wigner density @xmath68 of a single wave packet : @xmath69 the latter saturates the uncertainty relation with a spatial uncertainty @xmath70 and a momentum uncertainty @xmath71 , and the folding ensures that now @xmath66 is always quantum mechanically consistent .",
    "however , in this algorithm both the one- and two - particle spectra depend on the wave packet width @xmath70 . the role of this parameter will be discussed in the context of our toy model study in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the `` classical '' and `` quantum '' algorithms differ only with respect to two points :    1 .",
    "the `` classical '' algorithm has no analogue for the gaussian prefactor @xmath72 in ( [ eq6 ] ) which is a genuine quantum effect stemming from the quantum mechanical localization properties of ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the gaussian single - particle distributions @xmath63 in the `` quantum '' algorithm are the quantum analogues of the `` bin functions '' in the `` classical '' agorithm . with the gaussian bin functions ( [ eq11 ] )",
    "the two agree for the choice @xmath73 .",
    "finite event statistics puts a lower practical limit on @xmath50 in the `` classical '' algorithm , but to get accurate spectra one should try to choose @xmath50 as small as possible , by simulating sufficiently many events .",
    "in contrast , @xmath70 in the `` quantum '' algorithm is the finite spatial width of the single - particle wave packets , and the limit @xmath74 ( which corresponds to @xmath52 ) is not physically relevant : according to ( [ eq8 ] ) it amounts to an emission function with infinite spatial extension and thus to a correlator @xcite @xmath75 .",
    "before describing realistic event generator simulations we discuss some analytical results for a classical toy model distribution @xmath67 .",
    "these are then used to test the algorithms of sections  [ sec2a ] and  [ sec2b ] , by applying those to sets of phase - space points @xmath76}$ ] generated from the model distribution with a monte carlo procedure . in this way we can make quantitative statements about i ) the @xmath70-dependence of the `` quantum '' algorithm , ii ) the @xmath50-dependence of the `` classical '' algorithm ( especially : how small @xmath50 has to be chosen to extract the limit @xmath52 numerically ) and iii ) the statistical requirements for the algorithms to work .",
    "the toy model , first introduced by zajc  @xcite , reads : @xmath77 the distribution is normalized to a total event multiplicity @xmath78 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 smoothly interpolates between completely position - momentum correlated and uncorrelated sources . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the position - momentum correlation vanishes and we are left with the product of two gaussians in @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the limit @xmath82 @xmath83",
    "the position - momentum correlation is perfect .",
    "the total phase - space volume of the distribution @xmath84 vanishes for @xmath85 .",
    "this strong @xmath28-dependence allows to study the performance of our numerical algorithms for different phase space volumes . in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the @xmath28-dependence of the one - particle spectrum and two - particle correlator , focussing in sections  [ sec3a ] and [ sec3b ] on analytical results , and comparing these in section  [ sec3c ] to numerical calculations .      inserting ( [ eq14 ] ) into ( [ eq10])-([eq13 ] )",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath86 we recover the physical hbt radius @xmath87 from ( [ eq20 ] ) in the limit @xmath52 or by inserting ( [ eq10 ] ) directly into ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the remarkable fact is that for sufficiently large @xmath28  @xcite , @xmath88 the hbt radius @xmath89 becomes negative and the two - particle correlator shows an unphysical rise of the correlation function with increasing @xmath90 .",
    "the change of sign in ( [ eq19 ] ) seems to be related to the violation of the uncertainty relation by the emission function for large @xmath28 when @xmath80 and @xmath81 become strongly correlated . at the critical value @xmath91 the phase - space volume @xmath92 of the source drops below 1 . only for @xmath93",
    "the distribution @xmath94 is a quantum mechanically allowed emission function , i.e. a wigner density .",
    "the practical importance of the zajc model in the unphysical limit @xmath95 is that it provides an extreme testing ground for our numerical algorithms .",
    "analytically , we conclude already from ( [ eq20 ] ) that in order to be close to the physical limit the bin width @xmath50 has to be small on the scale of the width of the generated momentum distribution , @xmath96 in the above toy model this requirement is independent of the strength of position - momentum correlations in the source .      inserting the model distribution @xmath94 into ( [ eq8 ] ) ( instead of ( [ eq10 ] ) ) , we find @xmath97 in this case , @xmath98 and @xmath99 satisfy @xmath100 independent of the value of @xmath70 and , in contrast to the `` classical '' algorithm , the radius parameter @xmath101 is now always positive , irrespective of the value of @xmath28 .",
    "even if the classical distribution @xmath102 is sharply localized in phase - space , its folding with minimum uncertainty wave packets leads to a quantum mechanically allowed emission function @xmath103 and to a correlator with falls off with increasing @xmath90 as expected .",
    "however , the spread of the one - particle momentum spectrum ( [ eq23 ] ) receives an additional contribution @xmath104 . choosing @xmath70 too small increases this term beyond the phenomenologically reasonable values , choosing it too large widens the corresponding hbt radius parameters significantly .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that @xmath70 can be interpreted as quantum mechanical `` size '' of the particle , @xmath105 fm .",
    "given the heuristic nature of these arguments and the significant modifications this implies for the spectra ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) , it is however fair to say that presently @xmath70 mainly plays the role of a regulator of unwanted violations of the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle while a deeper understanding of its origin in the particle production dynamics is still missing .",
    "we have studied the performance of our bose - einstein algorithms by generating with a random number generator sets @xmath106}$ ] of phase - space points according to the distribution @xmath94 and comparing the numerical results of our algorithms to the analytical expressions of section  [ sec3a ] and  [ sec3b ] .",

    "[ fig1](b ) , the situation is both qualitatively and quantitatively different .",
    "now , the hbt radius is always positive , since the gaussian wave packets take quantum mechanical localization properties automatically into account .",

    "we tested the accuracy and statistical requirements of these algorithms in simple toy model studies and applied them in a first realistic study to the hadronic channels in @xmath124 @xmath125 annihilation at the @xmath6-peak and near the @xmath126-@xmath127 threshold .",
    "however , a comparative study of both algorithms is still missing and our main goal , the application of these algorithms to the study of event simulations of heavy ion collisions , is not achieved yet .",
    "we plan to do so in the near future .",
    "also , we plan to make the algorithms described in section  [ sec2 ] publicly available , using the open standard for codes and routines ( oscar ) format , advocated in  @xcite .",
