    "the motivation for this survey was twofold :    * search for diffuse gamma - ray emission from the galactic plane * search for gamma - ray point sources    diffuse emission from the galactic plane results from the interactions of charged cosmic rays with interstellar gas confined to the plane or with photons .",
    "diffuse emission in the energy range from tens of mev to tens of gev has been studied intensively by sas  2 ( fichtel et al .",
    "1975 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1979 ) , cos  b ( mayer - hasselwander et al . 1980 , 1982 ) and egret ( hunter et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the basic features can be modeled assuming @xmath8 decay as the dominant mechanism , with the gamma - ray emission proportional to the product of the gas column density and the cosmic - ray density ( see , e.g. , hunter et al .",

    "the distribution of cosmic rays is assumed to follow the matter density with a characteristic correlation scale of 1.5 to 2 kpc ( hunter et al .",
    "in addition to diffuse galactic gamma rays , there is also a small extragalactic component , which should be fairly isotropic ( fichtel et al . 1978 ; sreekumar et al .",
    "1998 ) . above 1 gev",
    ", data show an excess in gamma - ray flux over model predictions ( hunter et al .",
    "1997 ; see however aharonian and atoyan 2000 ) . at these energies ,",
    "contributions from inverse compton scattering of electrons start to become relevant ( see , e.g. , porter & protheroe 1997 ) . in response ,",
    "revised models speculate that the local measurements of the electron flux may not be representative for the entire galaxy ( porter & protheroe 1997 ; pohl & esposito 1998 ) .",
    "electron propagation is limited by radiative losses , and the local electron spectra are strongly influenced by the history of sources in the local neighborhood ( aharonian , atoyan & vlk 1995 ; pohl & esposito 1998 ) . in case that the solar system is in an `` electron void '' , diffuse gamma - ray emission at high energies could be an order of magnitude above predictions based on local electron spectra ( pohl & esposito 1998 ) . detailed models of the full spectrum of diffuse gamma - ray emission from the galaxy ( moskalenko & strong 2000 ; strong , moskalenko & reimer 1999 , 2000 ) also favour a harder electron spectrum . in the galactic plane",
    "another ` diffuse ' gamma - ray flux component arises from the hard energy spectrum of those galactic crs that are still confined in the ensemble of their unresolved sources .",
    "assuming these to be snrs , berezhko & vlk ( 2000 ) showed that their spatially averaged contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray flux at 1  tev should exceed the model predictions of hunter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "it is therefore of significant interest to search for the extension of the diffuse emission from the galactic plane at higher energies .",
    "upper limits on diffuse gamma - ray emission at tev energies have been reported by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and lebohec et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , at a level of a few @xmath9 of the cosmic - ray flux .",
    "the most stringent limits at higher energies , above 100 tev , were given by borione et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and constrain the diffuse flux to less than @xmath10 of the cosmic - ray flux .",
    "the galactic plane is also a region rich in potential gamma - ray point sources . for obvious reasons , supernova remnants as well as pulsar driven nebulae cluster along the galactic plane .",
    "both types of objects are almost certainly accelerators of cosmic rays and emitters of high - energy gamma radiation .",
    "theoretical models predict that typical gamma - ray fluxes from the majority of these objects are below the detection threshold of the current generation of instruments ( see , e.g. , aharonian et al . 1997 ; drury et al .",
    "however , both the lack of knowledge of the individual source parameters as well as approximations used in the modeling result in large uncertainties in the predictions for individual objects , by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "in addition to pulsars and supernova remnants , many unidentified egret sources lie in the galactic plane .",
    "given the density of source objects , a survey provides an efficient way to search for gamma - ray emission .",
    "the selection of the region to be surveyed was governed both by astrophysical and by practical considerations .",
    "using the egret observations of the diffuse gamma - ray flux ( hunter et al .",
    "1997 ) as a guideline , a region within the inner galaxy ( @xmath11 ) and close to the galactic equator should show the strongest emission , corresponding to the gas column density .",
    "similarly , the density of supernova remnants ( green 1998 ) and pulsars ( tayler 1993 ) is highest in this region .",
    "however , from the location of the hegra telescope system , at @xmath12 n , the galactic centre region can only be observed at rather unfavourable zenith angles of 60@xmath5 or more , and the observation time is rather limited . at such large zenith angles ,",
    "the energy threshold of the telescopes is increased from 500 gev for vertical showers to 5 tev at 60@xmath5 ( konopelko",
    "best sensitivity is obtained for observations at zenith angles below 30@xmath5 , favouring regions at larger galactic longitude .",
    "another potential problem for cherenkov observations is the large and spatially varying background light from regions of the galactic plane , which may result in non - uniform sensitivity across the field of view of the cherenkov telescopes .    as a result of these considerations , a rather dark region at about 40@xmath5",
    "longitude was chosen for the survey , with an extension in galactic longitude of 5@xmath5 and in latitude of 15@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_region ] ) . the relatively large range in latitude",
    "was chosen in order to cover the full range expected for diffuse gamma - ray emission , taking into account that the inverse compton mechanisms may result in a wider latitude distribution than observed in the egret data , and to include additional background regions at large latitude .",
    "the observation region includes part of the `` sagittarius arm '' , one of the spiral arms of the galaxy .",

    "the analysis of cherenkov images could potentially suffer from variations in the sky brightness over the scan region . since the readout electronics of the telescopes is ac coupled , a star illuminating a pixel will not cause baseline shifts , but it will still result in increased noise in that pixel . as a measure of the influence of night sky background light ,",

    "[ fig_region ]    for reference and comparison , observations of the crab nebula in the winters 1997/1998 , 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 were used , and were subject to identical selection criteria . in total , 41.7 h of observations at zenith angles between 18@xmath5 and 32@xmath5 were used , with a roughly uniform coverage of the zenith angle range .",
    "the last telescope integrated into the system , ct2 , one of the corner telescopes , was only used for part of the crab reference data sets .",
    "therefore , all analyses discussed in the following were performed both using only the four telescopes , as well as the full set of five telescopes .",

    "in fact , indiscriminate combination of 2 , 3 , 4 and 5-telescope events may deteriorate the sensitivity compared to 5-telescope events alone .",
    "for these reasons , the current analysis is based exclusively on events with five triggered telescopes for point sources and on four and five triggered telescopes for extended sources .",
    "for a given point source candidate , events reconstructed within 0.11@xmath5 of the source direction were counted , after applying a cut on @xmath18 at 1.1 to reject cosmic - ray events . in case of extended objects , such as snr ,",
    "the angular cut was increased to 0.2@xmath5 or 0.25@xmath5 depending on the source size , to ensure that the whole source is contained in the search region and in addition the 4-telescope events were used , since angular resolution is no longer critical . to estimate backgrounds , three regions of the same size as the source region",

    "that the step size is smaller than the angular resolution to ensure that no sources are missed .",
    "this implies , however , that significances quoted for adjacent points are highly correlated .",
    "the highest significance observed is 4.1@xmath37 , compatible with the expected distribution in the absence of sources .",

    "[ fig_uplmap ] . for the well - sampled points of the survey the limits are below 10% of the crab flux .",
    "the limits given assume a slope of the energy spectrum similar to the crab nebula .",
    "however , since limits are given for an energy which corresponds to the peak differential detection rate , the variation of the limits with the assumed spectral index is small ( aharonian et al .",
    "1995 ) . for a variation of @xmath40 in the spectral index ,",
    "the limits typically change by 6% .",
    "+ specific flux limits were derived for the potential source candidates , namely the 15 pulsars , the 6 supernova remnants , and the egret source . in case of the fairly extended snr w50 ,",
    "hot spots known from x - ray measurements were treated as point sources .",
    "the so called eastern lobe ( e3 , see tab .",
    "[ tab_snr ] ) and the associated knot e2 were treated as extended sources .",

    ". + table  [ tab_upperlimit ] lists the upper limits obtained for all objects .",
    "compared to the search for point sources , the search for diffuse gamma - ray emission from the galactic plane is complicated by the extended structure of the emission region .",
    "the structure may be extended in latitude beyond the field of view .",
    "[ fig_difflat ] illustrates the profile in galactic latitude as measured by egret in the longitude range 30@xmath5 to 50@xmath5 , at energies above 1 gev .",
    "the egret latitude profile can be represented as a sum of two gaussians and an constant background value . since the angular resolution of the egret instrument above 1 gev is narrower than the latitude extend of the diffuse emission the latitude dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig_difflat ] indicates real structure .",
    "because of the possible change of the primary emission mechanism between the gev and tev range , from @xmath41 decay to inverse compton scattering ( porter & protheroe , 1997 ; pohl & esposito , 1998 ) , and because of the completely different parent and target populations in the two cases , the latitude dependence may differ at tev energies . at gev energies , the latitude distribution of gamma - ray emissivity is characterized by the scale height of interstellar gas , around 100 pc for atomic hydrogen ( lockman 1984 ) and somewhat less for molecular hydrogen ( dame 1987 ) . in contrast , inverse - compton interactions with the uniform microwave background photons are governed by the scale height of the electron component of cosmic rays , which might be characterized by the kpc scale describing the coupling of cosmic rays to matter .",
    "the scale height of far - infrared target photons , on the other hand , was given by cox , krgel and metzger ( 1986 ) as  100 pc , similar to the scale height of the gas .",
    "porter and protheroe ( 1997 ) find , from numerical simulations of electron propagation , a scale height of more than 500 pc for the inverse - compton emissivity at 1 tev .",
    "+ in the following , we will discuss three techniques to search for diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "the techniques differ in the degree of assumptions they make concerning the latitude dependency of the diffuse emission , and also in their sensitivity to systematic variations in the performance and characteristics of the telescopes .",
    "+    the most robust and model - independent  but also least sensitive  technique to derive limits on the diffuse flux simply selects events according to their shapes as gamma - ray candidates .",
    "a cut on @xmath18 less than 1.0 keeps about 1/2 of the gamma - rays , but rejects cosmic rays very efficiently ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mscw ] ) . in order to achieve the best separation between gamma - ray images and cosmic - ray images ,",
    "only five - telescope events were used .",
    "such events with small @xmath18 include genuine gamma - rays , electron showers from the diffuse cosmic - ray electron flux , and the tail of the distribution of cosmic - ray nuclear showers . assigning all 428 events after cut as diffuse gamma - rays a 99% upper limit on the diffuse gamma - ray flux at 1 tev of 23.4 @xmath42 ph @xmath3 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 mev@xmath4 results , for @xmath43 .",
    "as mentioned in the discussion of the point source limits , the measurement determines the integral flux above the energy threshold of the telescope system , rather than directly determining the differential flux .",
    "therefore the result depends in principle on the assumed spectral index . however , since flux values are quoted at energies corresponding roughly to the peak detection rates , the limits vary only very little with the spectral index .",
    "we note that the diffuse electron flux ( see , e.g. , the compilation by barwick et al .",
    "1998 ) should contribute about 1/3 of the number of gamma - ray candidates ; the limit can of course also be viewed as a limit on the electron flux , since the selection cuts are equally efficient for gamma - ray induced showers and electron - induced showers .",
    "+ the limit obtained by this technique can be improved by subtracting , on a statistical basis , the number of gamma - ray candidate events resulting from cosmic - ray electrons or protons .",
    "since it is virtually impossible to verify that simulations properly account for the tail towards very small @xmath44 of the distribution of proton showers , such a subtraction has to be performed using an experimental background region , sufficiently far away from the galactic plane such that diffuse gamma - ray emission from the plane is most probably negligible .",
    "such a background data sample will only contain the isotropic electron and nucleon flux . in order to minimize instrumental effects",
    ", the background sample should be taken at the same time , and at identical zenith angles .",
    "data sets can be normalized to each other using the rates of events with large @xmath18 ( @xmath45 ) , well outside the gamma - ray region .",
    "unfortunately , the availability of suitable background data samples with the same telescope configuration is limited to 4.1 h of data , and the statistical error of the background data set limits the sensitivity . after a @xmath46 cut 1928 events survived compared to 141 events in the referenc sample .",
    "the scaling factor between the two datasets is determined to 13.3 and the mc simulations predict 555 events for a crab like source smeared out over a fov of @xmath47 .",

    "since the analysis used to derive this limit is only sensitive to the variation of the diffuse flux with @xmath31 , rather than its absolute value , a distribution significantly wider than at egret energies will increase the limit .",
    "other variants of the data analysis are sensitive to the absolute flux , but give less stringent limits of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ph @xmath3 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 mev@xmath4 .",
    "the limit on the tev gamma - ray flux can be used to derive a lower limit on the spectral index of the diffuse radiation of 2.5 , and to exclude models which predict a strong enhancement of the diffuse flux compared to conventional mechanisms .",
    "however the tev flux limit is only about a factor of 1.5 larger than the predicted flux from unresolved snrs . a more sensitive survey should therefore be able to test this prediction , together with a determination of the `` diffuse '' tev gamma - ray spectrum that is directly related to the galactic cr source spectrum .",
