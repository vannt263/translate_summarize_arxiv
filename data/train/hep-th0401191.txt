    "according to dijkgraaf and vafa @xcite , the effective glueball superpotential of @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory has an asymptotic expansion given by the planar part of the topological expansion of a matrix model . to give the effective potential for various vacua of the gauge theory , dijkgraaf and vafa",
    "propose a formula obtained by saddle point expansion of the matrix integral around different critical points .",
    "the filling fractions , i.e. , the fraction of the eigenvalues sitting close to each of the critical points of the potential are the parameters selecting the vacua .    in this paper we give a way to define non - perturbatively ( i.e. , beyond the saddle point expansion ) the matrix integrals .",
    "different integrals are integrals over different cycles in the space of normal matrices . in the case of generic polynomial potentials",
    "it is possible to construct a cycle for each of the critical points , so that all effective potentials considered by dijkgraaf and vafa arise in the asymptotic expansion of our integrals .",
    "we note that the idea of integrating over eigenvalues along suitable contours in the complex plane appears in special situations in @xcite .",
    "david s contours were also more recently considered in @xcite , where a ( non - holomorphic ) modification of the integral was proposed to obtain arbitrary filling factors .",
    "a second result of this paper is the description of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues for each critical point .",
    "the eigenvalues , as predicted by dijkgraaf and vafa , lie asymptotically along arcs connecting branch points of a two - fold cover of the complex plane .",
    "we give a reality condition which specifies the shape of the arcs and the density of eigenvalues .    before considering the case of general @xmath2 matrices , it is instructive to consider the case @xmath3 of ordinary integrals .",
    "consider the airy integral @xmath4 this integral gives a formal solution of the airy differential equation @xmath5 . indeed",
    "the saddle point expansion around the two critical points of the integrand give the two linear independent formal power series solutions .",
    "the non - perturbative solutions can be obtained by integrating along paths in the complex plane connecting any two of the three directions at infinity where the integrand goes to zero .",
    "more generally , the integrals of the form @xmath6 for a generic polynomial @xmath7 of degree @xmath8 are solutions of a differential equation of order @xmath9 .",
    "we show that a system of @xmath9 linearly independent solutions are obtained by choosing @xmath8 integration contours in the complex plane going to infinity in directions where the integrand decays exponentially .",
    "moreover the contours can be chosen so that each of them passes through exactly one of the @xmath8 critical points .",
    "it follows that the @xmath9 saddle point expansions at each of the critical points are the asymptotic expansions of true solutions given by convergent integrals .    in the case of matrices",
    "we consider integrals of the form @xmath10 over real @xmath11-dimensional cycles @xmath12 in the space of complex @xmath2 matrices .",
    "the potential @xmath13 is a polynomial with complex coefficients , @xmath14 and the normalization factor @xmath15 is such that @xmath16 . the observables @xmath17 are holomorphic functions invariant under conjugation . in the well - studied case of integrals over hermitian matrices , with a polynomial @xmath13 with real coefficients bounded below ,",
    "the saddle point approximation becomes exact in the large @xmath18 limit with fixed @xmath19 and the relevant critical point is described by an asymptotic _ density of eigenvalues _ which has support on a union of intervals on the real axis . if @xmath19 is small , these intervals are small neighborhoods of the minima of the potential @xmath13 . to obtain the densities of eigenvalues needed to make contact to gauge theory",
    "one considers the variational problem for critical points subject to the side condition that the fraction of eigenvalues in the vicinity of each of the critical points ( not just minima ) are given numbers .",
    "we consider here the case of a generic polynomial @xmath13 of degree @xmath8 with complex coefficients , with distinct critical points @xmath20 , and propose to consider integrals over cycles in the space of normal matrices ( a matrix is normal if it commutes with its adjoint or , equivalently , if it is conjugated to a diagonal matrix by a unitary matrix ) .",
    "the cycles we consider are parametrized by integers @xmath21 whose sum is @xmath18 and are characterized by the condition that @xmath22 eigenvalues belong to a path @xmath23 in the complex plane going through @xmath24 and going to infinity in a direction where @xmath25 . in the limit @xmath26 with",
    "@xmath27 fixed , the eigenvalues in the saddle point approximation ( supposed to be exact in the limit ) are distributed along @xmath9 arcs in the complex plane . for small @xmath19",
    "the arcs are close to the critical points and the @xmath28th arcs contains the fraction @xmath29 of the eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath30 be a polynomial of degree @xmath31 with complex coefficients .",
    "we want to consider integrals of the form @xmath32 for polynomials @xmath33 . before considering the question of integration cycles we may evaluate such integrals as asymptotic series as @xmath34 by formal application of the saddle point method at each of the critical points @xmath20 , which we assume to be distinct . in this way we get @xmath9 asymptotic series of the form @xmath35 and",
    "the question is whether these are asymptotic expansions of our integral for suitable cycles @xmath23 .    the cycles which we should consider here are ( linear combinations of ) paths for which the integral converges .",
    "as the integrand is holomorphic , homotopic paths will give the same answer and what matters is the behavior at infinity .",
    "as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , so there are @xmath8 directions in the complex plane for which @xmath38 as @xmath39 tends to infinity in these directions .",
    "let us call these asymptotic directions valleys as in these directions the integrand decays exponentially .",
    "neighboring valleys are separated by hills , which are directions of exponential increase of the integrand .",
    "so the cycles one needs to consider are linear combinations of infinite paths connecting pairs of distinct valleys . as paths connecting two valleys can be deformed into sums of paths connecting the two valleys with any third one , there are only @xmath9 linearly independent cycles .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the critical values @xmath40 have distinct imaginary parts .",
    "then there is a canonical way to associate to each critical point @xmath24 a path @xmath23 in such a way that the asymptotic expansion of the integral over @xmath23 as @xmath34 is obtained by the saddle point expansion at @xmath24 .",
    "namely , we take the _ steepest descent _",
    "paths(see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) emerging from @xmath24 , defined by the condition that the tangent vector at each point points in the direction of the gradient of @xmath41 . as @xmath42 is holomorphic , the gradient of @xmath43 is orthogonal to the gradient of @xmath44 by the cauchy  riemann equations .",
    "thus steepest descent paths are level lines for the imaginary part of @xmath42 .",
    "each non - degenerate critical point @xmath24 is at the intersection of two such level lines .",
    "one of these two lines , the one along which @xmath41 takes its minimum at @xmath24 , is the steepest descent path @xmath23 . along the other line @xmath45 ,",
    "the real part takes its maximum at @xmath24 . we claim that @xmath23 is a smooth path going to infinity in both directions and connecting two valleys",
    "indeed , @xmath23 is ( in suitable parametrization ) given by a solution of the differential equation @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that latexmath:[$\\frac d{dt}\\mathrm{re}(p(z(t)))=    imaginary parts , so the steepest descent path passing through @xmath24 may not come close to any other critical point .",
    "thus @xmath48 is bounded below so that , as we go away from @xmath24 , @xmath49 must go to infinity and the path @xmath23 connects two valleys .",
    "similarly @xmath50 connects two hills .",
    "as @xmath23 and @xmath50 cross at @xmath24 , the two valleys connected by @xmath23 are separated by hills and are thus different .",
    "we have thus shown that for each critical point @xmath24 there is a steepest descent path @xmath23 going through @xmath24 and connecting pairs of different valleys .",
    "on @xmath23 the real part of @xmath42 is minimal at @xmath24 so that the saddle point expansion at @xmath24 indeed gives the asymptotic expansion of the integral over @xmath23 .",
    "we consider matrix integrals of the form for @xmath42 a polynomial of degree @xmath8 .",
    "they are integrals of holomorphic differential forms over @xmath11 dimensional cycles . for each set of natural numbers",
    "@xmath51 summing up to @xmath18 , we have a cycle in the normal matrices , characterized by the condition that @xmath22 eigenvalues run over the path @xmath23 of the previous section .",
    "more precisely , the cycle @xmath12 is parametrized by @xmath52 : @xmath53 the first @xmath54 diagonal elements @xmath55 are parametrizations of @xmath56 , the next @xmath57 are parametrizations of @xmath58 and so on .    the usual argument to reduce the integral to an integral over the eigenvalues ( see @xcite ) gives @xmath59 the integral is over @xmath60 and the function @xmath61 , a function on matrices invariant under conjugation , is regarded as a symmetric function of the eigenvalues .      to study the large @xmath18 limit , it is useful to introduce the trace of the resolvent : @xmath62 as products of such traces are generating functions of polynomial functions invariant under conjugation .",
    "the `` loop equation '' @xcite for this quantity is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a polynomial of degree @xmath65 with leading coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "this equation can be derived from the identity @xmath67 in the limit @xmath68 , the matrix integral is supposed to be dominated by an integral over a region where the eigenvalues are close ( for small @xmath19 ) to critical points of @xmath13 . with our choice of integration cycles and keeping @xmath69 fixed as @xmath68 , there will be a fraction @xmath70 of the eigenvalues close to @xmath71 .    in the limit @xmath68 one",
    "expects that the saddle point approximation becomes exact and thus @xmath72 converges to @xmath73 for some probability measure @xmath74 with support in regions around the critical points of @xmath13 and so that @xmath29 is the measure of the region around @xmath24 .",
    "technically one assumes that the limit @xmath68 exists and that @xmath75 .",
    "the function @xmath76 is defined and holomorphic for @xmath39 outside the support of the measure . setting @xmath77 we finally obtain @xmath78 for some polynomial @xmath79 of degree @xmath65 with leading coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "thus the function @xmath80 , which is a priori defined on the complement of the support of the measure , has an analytic continuation to a two - fold covering of the complex plane .",
    "the original function @xmath81 is the branch of the function defined by which behaves at infinity as @xmath82 .      with the analogy with the case of hermitian matrices in mind ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the measure @xmath74 has support on a collection of arcs @xmath83 which for small @xmath19 are close to the critical points of @xmath13 , and that @xmath84 for some _ density of eigenvalues _ @xmath85 defined on the arcs : namely , the measure @xmath86 of a set @xmath87 intersecting one of the arcs , say @xmath88 , in a piece @xmath89 is @xmath90 note that for the right - hand side to be defined we need to fix an orientation on @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath80 is a holomorphic function outside on the complement of the arcs and the density on @xmath88 is related to the discontinuity of @xmath81 : @xmath91 here @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) denotes the limit of @xmath80 as @xmath39 tends to @xmath94 from the left ( from the right ) of the oriented curve @xmath88 .    from this information",
    "we deduce that the arcs @xmath88 connect pairs of zeros of @xmath81 , the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve @xmath95 of genus @xmath65 .",
    "the measure of the @xmath96th arc is then the period @xmath97 over a cycle @xmath98 enclosing the pair of branch points in counterclockwise direction .",
    "it follows from the condition on the leading coefficient of @xmath99 that @xmath100 .",
    "we also note that since @xmath101 , we have the formula @xmath102 .",
    "there remains to determine the precise form of the arcs and the coefficients in @xmath99 as functions of the filling fractions @xmath70 .",
    "first of all , the relation between the @xmath65 free complex coefficients @xmath103 of @xmath79 ( recall that the leading coefficient is fixed to be @xmath104 ) and the periods @xmath70 ( @xmath105 ) subject to @xmath100 is , locally around any point where the branch points are distinct , a holomorphic diffeomorphism , since the jacobian matrix @xmath106 is non - degenerate , being the matrix of @xmath107-periods of a basis of abelian differentials on a smooth curve .",
    "it follows that locally there exists a real @xmath108-dimensional submanifold in the complex space @xmath109 of coefficients @xmath110 which maps to real positive @xmath70 .",
    "the condition that fixes the shape of the arcs is the reality and positivity condition for the density : if @xmath111 is a parametrization of the arc @xmath88 respecting its orientation , the condition is @xmath112 using @xmath113 , we may parametrize the arcs ( away from the endpoints ) to be solutions of the differential equation @xmath114 connecting branch points . alternatively",
    ", arcs may be described as level lines of a function : introduce the hyperelliptic integral @xmath115 it is a holomorphic many - valued function on the complement of the support of the measure . as we go around an arc @xmath88 , @xmath116 increases by @xmath70 so @xmath117",
    "is single valued .",
    "the measure of a piece between two points @xmath118 , @xmath119 on a curve @xmath88 is @xmath120 which is real .",
    "thus the arcs @xmath88 are level lines of the imaginary part of @xmath116 . around a branch point",
    "@xmath121 which is a simple zero of @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "therefore there are three smooth level lines of @xmath61 emerging from every simple branch points . in the most general situation the support of the measure may then be a graph consisting of level lines of @xmath124 joining branch points .",
    "a more precise description is possible in the case of small @xmath19 to which we turn .      for small @xmath125",
    "we claim that the arcs and the density of eigenvalues are determined completely by the filling fractions @xmath70 through and . to show this , notice first that as @xmath34",
    ", pairs of branch points @xmath126 converge to the critical points @xmath71 and the periods @xmath70 ( eq .  ) , regarded as functions of @xmath19 and the coefficients @xmath110 of @xmath99 are holomorphic at @xmath127 .",
    "we have @xmath128 since there is a bijective holomorphic correspondence between values @xmath129 at the distinct points @xmath71 and coefficients @xmath110 of @xmath99 , we have at @xmath127 , and by analyticity also for small @xmath19 , a biholomorphic map @xmath130 , @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , we can invert this map and find a unique @xmath99 for each set of @xmath131 , such that @xmath100 .",
    "it remains to show that for all small @xmath125 there is a level line @xmath88 of @xmath117 connecting @xmath132 to @xmath133 . as @xmath34 , @xmath134",
    "the level lines of @xmath135 at @xmath127 are thus the level lines of @xmath43 . in the neighborhood of a non - degenerate critical point",
    "@xmath71 they look like the left picture in fig .  [ f-1 ] : on any small circle around @xmath71 each value is taken on at most four times .",
    "( 150,130)(60,0 )    for positive small @xmath19",
    "the critical point @xmath71 splits into two branch points @xmath132 , @xmath133 from each of which three level lines emerge .",
    "the condition that the period @xmath70 is real implies that @xmath136 .",
    "the function @xmath137 is defined up to a sign in a neighborhood of @xmath126 , so that its zero level line is uniquely defined .",
    "it follows that there is a level line @xmath88 of @xmath124 , namely the zero set of @xmath138 , joining @xmath132 to @xmath133 as on the right picture in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] : if none of the level lines emerging from @xmath132 and @xmath133 were to join , @xmath139 would take the value zero six times on any small circle encircling @xmath126 , which can not be , as this does not happen at @xmath127 . also , a level line can not go from a point @xmath132 or @xmath133 to itself as the real part of @xmath61 is monotonic along level lines .",
    "we conclude that for any small @xmath125 , and any given filling fractions @xmath140 summing up to 1 , there is a unique polynomial @xmath141 , so that the curve @xmath142 has @xmath107-periods @xmath70 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath81 are connected in pairs by arcs @xmath88 obeying the reality condition . according to the discussion above ,",
    "these arcs are are the support of the measure and the density of eigenvalue is @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "we have given a non - perturbative definition of the matrix integrals that in the large @xmath18 limit give the superpotentials considered in @xcite .",
    "we considered the case of a generic polynomial potential with complex coefficients . for small t",
    "hooft coupling @xmath19 , the density of eigenvalues was shown to be given by arcs connecting pairs of branch points of a hyperelliptic curve .",
    "the shape of the arcs is uniquely determined by a reality condition . for larger @xmath19 or for potentials with degenerate critical points",
