    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) enables the study of the interaction between light and matter at the most elementary level , thanks to the achievement of a strong coupling between a single atom and a single photon trapped in a microwave or optical cavity@xcite .",
    "this paradigm has been recently brought into superconducting circuits : artificial atoms consisting of two level superconducting circuits have been coupled to superconducting cavities@xcite , in the context of circuit qed .",
    "these experiments provide an ideal playground to test the basic laws of quantum mechanics because they can be described in terms of simple models like the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .",
    "however , such models conceal essential physical differences between cavity and circuit qed .",
    "on the one hand , the coupling between isolated atoms and cavity photons mainly occurs due to the sensitivity of the atom electric dipole to the cavity electric field .",
    "this coupling depends on microscopic details since the atomic dipole is set by the structure of the atom electronic orbitals .",
    "furthermore , one can generally perform the `` electric - dipole approximation '' which assumes that the cavity field varies little on the scale of the atomic system@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of submicronic superconducting circuits is essentially insensitive to microscopic details due to the rigidity of the superconducting phase@xcite .",
    "for instance , the behavior of a superconducting charge qubit can be described with one macroscopic variable , i.e. the total charge of a superconducting island@xcite .",
    "this charge can vary due to the josephson coupling between the island and an external superconducting reservoir .",
    "the coupling between the superconducting charge qubit and the cavity is usually described in terms of a capacitive coupling between the superconducting island and the cavity central conductor . as a result ,",
    "the chemical potential of the superconducting island is shifted proportionally to the cavity electric potential@xcite .",
    "this picture implies strong inhomogeneities of the photonic electric field on the scale of the superconducting qubit , in contrast to what is generally considered in atomic cavity qed for a single atom .",
    "recent technological progress is enabling the development of a new type of experiments where nanocircuits based on carbon nanotubes , semiconducting nanowires , two - dimensional electron gases or graphene , are coupled to coplanar microwave cavities@xcite .",
    "this paves the way for the development of `` mesoscopic qed '' , a denomination introduced in a pioneering theory work@xcite .",
    "mesoscopic qed opens many possibilities because nanoconductors can be tunnel - coupled to various types of fermionic reservoirs such as normal metals , ferromagnets@xcite or superconductors@xcite , in a large variety of geometries .",
    "so far , theoretical studies on mesoscopic qed have mainly focused on quantum dot circuits@xcite .",
    "several configurations have been suggested to reach the strong coupling regime between an electronic spin and cavity photons@xcite , or more generally , to develop quantum computing schemes@xcite .",
    "mesoscopic qed also tackles problems which go beyond the mechanics of closed two level systems coupled to cavities , usually considered in cavity or circuit qed .",
    "the interaction between electronic transport and the light - matter interaction leads to a rich phenomenology@xcite .",
    "besides , coplanar cavities could be used as a powerful probe to reveal some exotic properties of hybrid nanocircuits , like for instance the existence of topological superconducting phases@xcite , majorana quasiparticle modes@xcite , or spin - entanglement in a cooper pair beam splitter@xcite .",
    "on the experimental side , pioneering works have focused on mesoscopic rings@xcite and metallic tunnel junctions@xcite .",
    "more recently , experiments have been performed with single quantum dots@xcite and double quantum dots ( dqds ) @xcite with normal metal reservoirs . reaching the strong coupling regime between the charge states of a dqd and",
    "a cavity is still a challenge@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , interesting resonance phenomena have already been observed@xcite .",
    "several experiments have also provided evidence for a modification of the cavity behavior by finite bias transport through a dqd@xcite , including a maser effect@xcite .",
    "these recent developments call for a full description of the coupling between a hybrid nanocircuit and cavity photons .",
    "one question naturally arises : is mesoscopic qed closer to atomic cavity qed or superconducting circuit qed ?",
    "what are the specificities of the coupling between a nanocircuit and a cavity ?",
    "so far , most theory works have considered a capacitive coupling between the nanocircuit and the cavity central conductor , by analogy with circuit qed@xcite .",
    "this approach implies a coarse grained electric description of the nanocircuit , and a concentration of the non - homogeneous photonic electric field inside some capacitive elements .",
    "a few works have considered a direct coupling between the motion of electrons trapped in the nanoconductors and the bare cavity electric field , which is assumed to be constant on the scale of the nanocircuit .",
    "this is reminiscent of the descriptions used in cavity qed@xcite . in this article",
    ", we introduce a description of mesoscopic qed which bridges between these two approaches .",
    "we use a model which focuses on conduction electrons tunneling between the different elements of a nanocircuit .",
    "the tunneling electrons occupy quasi - localized orbitals in each nanocircuit element , which recalls the atomic orbital degree of freedom of cavity qed .",
    "however , there also exists collective plasmonic modes in the nanocircuit , which can screen at least partially the cavity fields .",
    "we use a gauge - invariant mesoscopic qed hamiltonian which accounts for the non - uniform screening of the cavity fields inside the nanocircuit , and for the electromagnetic boundary conditions provided by cavity conductors and voltage - biased nanocircuit dc gates . in the limit where photon - induced magnetic effects are negligible",
    ", we can reexpress the mesoscopic qed hamiltonian in terms of a scalar photonic pseudo - potential .",
    "this picture unifies the different approaches used so far to describe mesoscopic qed devices , since the photonic pseudo - potential can vary linearly with space in the case of a locally uniform photonic electric field ( dipolar coupling limit ) , as well as remain constant inside a given circuit element in the limit of a coarse grained circuit model . in the framework of a tunneling model , the photonic pseudo - potential leads to various types of linear electron / photon coupling terms : cavity photons shift the orbital energies of the different nanocircuit elements , but also induce simultaneously tunneling and local orbital transitions .",
    "this general description can be used to study the behavior of many different types of mesoscopic qed devices .",
    "for instance , it can be applied to quantum dot circuits , molecular circuits , quantum point contacts , metallic tunnel junctions , and superconducting nanostructures enclosing andreev bound states or majorana bound states . to illustrate the richness of our approach",
    ", we study in details the elementary example of a cavity coupled to a `` quantum rc circuit '' , i.e. a single quantum dot coupled to a single normal metal reservoir .",
    "the photon - induced tunneling terms between the quantum dot and the reservoir induce a non - universal relation between the cavity frequency pull and the cavity damping pull , contrarily to what is expected with purely capacitive coupling schemes at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ii a , we discuss the gauge - invariant mesoscopic qed hamiltonian , which involves a photonic vector potential . in section ii b ,",
    "we perform a unitary transformation to obtain a new hamiltonian where the electron / photon coupling is due to the scalar photonic pseudo - potential . in section ii c , we reexpress the photonic pseudo - potential scheme in the framework of a tunnelling model . in section ii d ,",
    "we discuss the application of our formalism to the case of nanocircuits with superconducting elements .",
    "in particular , we give an explicit hamiltonian for a nanostructure with majorana bound states coupled to a cavity . in section iii",
    ", we work out in details the case of the quantum rc circuit coupled to a cavity .",
    "section iv concludes .",
    "appendix a gives a detailed mathematical justification for the form of the hamiltonian of section ii a , on the basis of an effective model which separates physically the tunneling electrons occupying individual orbital states in the different elements of a nanocircuit , from the plasmonic collective modes of this nanocircuit .",
    "appendix b discusses the advantages of the photonic pseudo - potential scheme .",
    "a nanocircuit encloses a large variety of degrees of freedom .",
    "our main interest in this paper is the interaction of the cavity with the ensemble @xmath0 of the `` tunneling '' conduction electrons , which can occupy orbital states in the different elements of a nanocircuit and tunnel between them .",
    "however , there also exists plasmonic electronic modes which are responsive for the screening of external fields from a massive metallic electrode .",
    "plasmons can also convey screening currents in the reservoir electrical lines , which reequilibrate locally charge distributions on tunnel junctions after a tunneling event .",
    "the question of plasmonic modes in a nanocircuit is complicated since nanoconductors have generally a low electronic density , which allows only a partial screening of the cavity field@xcite . in principle , even the metallic contacts of the nanocircuit are not able to screen totally the cavity field due to their thinness . in the limit where the nanocircuit contacts are connected to outside electrical lines with a low impedance ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the dynamics of plasmonic modes in the nanocircuit is very fast compared to the dynamics of the cavity modes and of the tunneling electrons@xcite . in this case , one can assume that the plasmonic modes in the nanocircuit generate a distribution of screening charges which is enslaved to the position of the tunneling charges and to the value of the cavity field .",
    "this produces a renormalization of the cavity field properties , and in particular its spatial dependence nearby and inside the nanocircuit .",
    "it also produces a renormalization of the coulomb interactions between the tunneling charges . in general",
    ", the coulomb interactions between the nanocircuit charges is also renormalized by the screening charges on the cavity conductors ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the positive ions and valence electrons constituting the crystalline structure of the nanocircuit can be treated in a mean field approach , leading to an effective potential @xmath1 which confines tunneling electrons inside the nanocircuit .",
    "this confinement potential can delimit quantum dots , or induce disorder effects in nanoconductors , for instance .",
    "this approach is sufficient provided the background charges producing @xmath1 and the microwave cavity are far off resonant . in this framework ,",
    "gauge invariance imposes the hamiltonian @xmath2 with@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath6 the elementary charge .",
    "the field operator @xmath7 includes all the tunneling charges of the nanocircuit . above",
    ", @xmath8 is a single electron hamiltonian , @xmath9 describes the coulomb interaction between the tunneling electrons ( see appendix a for details ) , and @xmath10 is the hamiltonian of a ( renormalized ) cavity electromagnetic mode .",
    "the potential @xmath11 is due to dc voltages applied on the nanocircuit electrostatic gates and to constant charges on floating conductors like the cavity central conductor in a coplanar geometry .",
    "the coupling between the cavity and the tunneling electrons arises from the photonic vector potential term of eq.([6 ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we have considered a single cavity mode with creation operator @xmath12 and vector potential profile @xmath13 .",
    "this description can be generalized straightforwardly to the multimode case by introducing a sum on a cavity mode index in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath13 can strongly vary on the scale of the nanocircuit .",
    "the formal description of the electromagnetic field and the light / matter interaction in mesoscopic qed requires some care . in atomic cavity qed , the cavity field",
    "is generally assumed to vary slowly on the scale of an atom@xcite .",
    "in contrast , we have to take into account strong spatial variations of the photonic field on the scale of a nanocircuit .",
    "in particular , a protrusion of a cavity conductor can be used to increase the photonic field locally , close to a given quantum dot @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the dc voltage - biased electrostatic gates , used to control the nanocircuit spectrum , provide supplementary boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field . besides",
    ", we have already mentioned that the plasmonic screening charges on the nanocircuit conductors can modify the photonic vector potential profile , especially inside and around fermionic reservoirs . in order to describe this complex reality and justify mathematically the shape of eqs.([1]-[6 ] ) , we introduce in appendix a an effective model which separates physically the tunneling electrons occupying individual orbital states in the nanocircuit from the collective plasmonic modes of the nanocircuit . in this framework",
    ", one can introduce a hodge decomposition of the electromagnetic field@xcite , which can be obtained thanks to the use of an auxiliary electrostatic green s function .",
    "this leads to the terms in @xmath14 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "( [ 1]-[6 ] ) .    in this section ,",
    "we disregard the spin of charge carriers because we want to focus on regimes where charge effects prevail",
    ". the introduction of the spin degree of freedom in hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) would be straightforward by invoking gauge invariance ( see for instance section [ ad ] ) .",
    "the direct coupling between the particles spin and the photonic magnetic field can usually be disregarded because this coupling is expected to be very weak unless collective excitations are considered in a large ensemble of spins@xcite . from recent predictions ,",
    "real@xcite or effective@xcite spin - orbit coupling provide an alternative way to obtain a spin - photon coupling .    in eq.([202 ] ) , the coupling of tunneling electrons to cavity photons occurs through two terms , one in @xmath15 , corresponding to single photon transitions , and the other one in @xmath16 , corresponding to two photon transitions .",
    "the second has no reason to be disregarded in the general case , even if it has no structure in the electronic sector .",
    "for instance , this term is crucial for determining the existence of a dicke quantum phase transition when many two - level systems are coupled transversely to a cavity@xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 term can also bring a non - negligible contribution to the cavity frequency pull caused by one nanocircuit , which is a central quantity in mesoscopic qed experiments ( see appendix b ) .",
    "hence , it is convenient to introduce a new representation in which the @xmath16 term is eliminated .",
    "this task is completed in the next section .      in atomic cavity qed",
    ", the power - zienau - wooley ( pzw ) transformation formally enables the elimination of a space - dependent @xmath17 term from the system hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "this generalizes the widely known `` electric - dipole '' transformation used in the case where @xmath18 can be considered as constant on the scale of an atom",
    ". however , the natural variables of the pzw hamiltonian are polarization and magnetization densities associated to the charge distribution of an atomic system , which are not directly useful in our case .",
    "to reexpress the pzw hamiltonian in terms of particles coordinates and momenta , it is necessary to perform a multipolar development of the light / matter interaction@xcite . in practice",
    ", this development is performed to a limited order , which means that only a moderate space dependence of the photonic electric and magnetic fields is taken into account . in this section ,",
    "we perform a unitary transformation of hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) in the same spirit as the pzw transformation , but with specificities required for mesoscopic qed . upon disregarding magnetic effects",
    ", we can take into account a strong space dependence of the photonic electric field , thanks to the use of a scalar photonic pseudo - potential .",
    "this procedure avoids the development of the light / matter interaction in terms of multipoles .",
    "this is necessary to describe e.g. multi - quantum dot circuits with strongly asymmetric capacitive couplings to the cavity .",
    "furthermore , we use a second - quantized description of charges , which is more convenient to describe central phenomena of mesoscopic physics like tunneling but also superconductivity ( see next section ) .    to account for the possibly strong spatial variations of @xmath13 on the scale of a nanocircuit",
    ", we define inside the volume of the nanocircuit a reference point @xmath19 and a continuous functional path @xmath20 relating any points @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we also define a photonic pseudo - potential @xmath23 with@xmath24 importantly , one can use @xmath25 inside the nanocircuit volume , provided the flux of @xmath26 through the nanocircuit can be disregarded .",
    "this criterion is generally satisfied , considering the typical amplitude of the cavity magnetic field and the size of nanoconductors . in this case",
    ", the arbitrariness on the choice of the contours @xmath20 leads only to marginal effects .",
    "one exception is nanocircuits with large loops leading to magnetic aharonov - bohm effects .",
    "this case is beyond the scope of the rest of this article , which focuses on  photon - induced electric effects .",
    "we perform the transformation @xmath27 with @xmath28 this gives @xmath29 with@xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this new representation",
    ", the single electron potential and the coulomb interactions are renormalized by the term in @xmath32 , but the electron / photon coupling takes a simpler linear form .",
    "the motion of tunneling electrons is modified by the pseudo - potential @xmath33 .",
    "note that the arbitrariness on the choice of @xmath19 is not an issue , since a change in @xmath19 shifts @xmath34 by a global constant and leads to a unitary transformation of @xmath35 . in the limit where the spatial dependence of the photonic vector potential can be disregarded i.e. @xmath36 , one finds @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to the electric - dipole approximation frequently used in atomic cavity qed . in the opposite limit of a small enough conductor or a perfect screening of @xmath39 inside this conductor",
    ", one can use a @xmath40 constant inside this conductor .",
    "this is reminiscent of the capacitive network models frequently used to describe superconducting charge qubits in circuit qed .",
    "note that we do not assume that the ensemble @xmath0 of the tunneling charges is neutral .      in this section ,",
    "we consider a nanocircuit gathering quantum dots and reservoirs connected by tunnel junctions .",
    "the effect of time - dependent classical fields on tunneling through quantum dots has been studied since the 1990s@xcite .",
    "mesoscopic circuit qed offers the opportunity to study the interaction between microwave photons and quantum dot circuits from a different perspective .",
    "quantum dot circuits are often described in terms of a tunneling model in which the dots and reservoirs contain quasi - localized orbitals coupled by tunnel elements@xcite .",
    "this decomposition is instrumental in order to particularize the treatment of the reservoirs and account for the irreversibility of transport processes or other reservoir - induced damping effects .",
    "importantly , the tunnel couplings arise from an overlap between neighboring orbitals .",
    "this means that these orbitals can not be considered as orthogonal , except in the limit of weak tunnel couplings ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , in practice , it may be necessary to take into account a strong inter - dot tunneling .",
    "for example , in the case of a dqd , there can exist a strong splitting between bonding and antibonding states , which can be resonant with the cavity@xcite . depending on the absolute energy scale of the dqd confinement potential",
    ", it might be necessary to go to the limit of a non - perturbative inter - dot tunnel coupling to obtain such a splitting . in order to circumvent the difficulty related to the non - orthogonality of the nanocircuit orbitals",
    ", we divide the nanocircuit into the ensemble @xmath41 of tunnel - coupled quantum dots from one side , and the different reservoirs with an index @xmath42 with @xmath43 , from the other side .",
    "we use an index @xmath44 ... @xmath45 to denote these different elements , and an index @xmath46 to denote the different orbitals in a given element @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that the low energy spectrum for the whole ensemble @xmath41 of the quantum dots can be determined in the absence of the reservoirs as the discrete spectrum of a potential profile with one or several potential wells .",
    "this procedure can be performed for an arbitrary inter - dot tunneling strength and leads to exactly orthogonal orbitals , so that @xmath48 .",
    "one can also define exactly orthogonal orbitals in the isolated reservoir @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , so that @xmath49 . in a second step",
    ", one can evaluate the tunnel coupling @xmath50 between the orbitals @xmath46 and @xmath51 of @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the overlap between their wavefunctions .",
    "this gives @xmath52 only at lowest order in tunneling@xcite .",
    "however , using a weak tunneling between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is not a severe restriction since the large density of states in the reservoirs can compensate for the smallness of the tunnel coupling elements , and lead to a large tunneling rate compatible with the kondo effect , for instance .",
    "to summarize , in the absence of the cavity , the tunnel hamiltonian writes@xmath53 where the creation operator @xmath54 corresponds to an orbital @xmath46 with energy @xmath55 and wavefunction @xmath56 mainly localized inside element @xmath44 ... @xmath45 .",
    "one can use @xmath57 at lowest order in the dot / reservoir tunnel couplings .",
    "we now reexpress the photonic pseudo - potential scheme of the previous section in the framework of the tunneling model . for this purpose",
    ", one needs to decompose the field operator @xmath58 associated to tunneling charges on the nanocircuit orbital states . at lowest order in the dot / reservoir tunneling , one can use@xcite @xmath59 hence , hamiltonian ( [ htottild ] ) directly gives@xmath60 with@xmath61 note that in principle , the term in @xmath32 from eq.([htottild ] ) renormalizes @xmath55 , @xmath62 and the coulomb interaction term @xmath63 , but this is not essential for the physics we discuss below .",
    "since the photonic pseudo - potential modifies the potential landscape seen by the tunneling charges , it can naturally affect all the parameters in the tunneling model .",
    "first , cavity photons shift the orbital energy @xmath64 , with a coupling coefficient@xmath65 in general , @xmath66 strongly depends on the indexes @xmath47 and @xmath46 due to the space dependence of @xmath67 .",
    "this makes the cavity - induced orbital energy shifts particularly relevant experimentally . for a standard metallic reservoir ,",
    "it is reasonable to disregard the dependence of @xmath66 on the orbital index @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath68 , because the properties of the electronic wavefunctions in the reservoir can be considered as constant near the fermi energy@xcite . in this framework ,",
    "a behavior similar to the capacitive coupling of the cavity central conductor to the reservoirs is recovered .",
    "this type of reservoir / cavity coupling enables one to interpret data obtained for a quantum dot coupled to two normal metal leads@xcite . in contrast , @xmath66 may strongly depend on @xmath46 for @xmath69 , as illustrated for instance by the example of a dqd with an asymmetric @xmath67@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath70 also contains coupling terms in @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "these terms include photon - induced tunneling terms in @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , and photon - induced transitions internal to @xmath47 , in @xmath75 . in principle , all the above cavity / nanocircuit coupling terms can coexist . in practice , we expect the terms in @xmath66 to be dominant over the tunnel terms in @xmath73 with @xmath74 , which involve a weak overlap between wavefunctions . nevertheless , as shown in the next section , the signatures of the photon - induced tunneling terms can be boosted by the large number of states they affect in the reservoirs .",
    "if @xmath67 varies slowly inside @xmath41 , the photon - induced transitions internal to @xmath41 are negligible , i.e. @xmath76 , since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are orthogonal by definition .",
    "however , these transitions become possible if the cavity field is weakly screened ( @xmath79 ) , or if a protrusion of a cavity conductor is placed close to one of the quantum dots in order to reinforce the spatial variations of @xmath80@xcite .",
    "transitions in @xmath81 can be particularly interesting in case of real or artificial spin orbit coupling which mixes spin and orbital states . in this case",
    ", the @xmath82 terms can correspond to spin - transitions inside a single quantum dot@xcite or a dqd@xcite . in the reservoirs , the @xmath83 terms are probably always non - resonant due to strong energy relaxation .",
    "hence , we will assume that these terms do not need to be treated explicitly because they can be included in a renormalization of the states @xmath84 .",
    "in practice , the potential @xmath67 can be evaluated numerically by removing all nanoconductors from the device and simulating the microwave electromagnetic field in the cavity in the presence of the metallic gates , sources and drains of the nanocircuit .",
    "this can be done using standard microwave simulation tools , which can take into account imperfect metals .",
    "it enables a realistic evaluation of the elements @xmath66 and @xmath73 .",
    "even if @xmath67 is not calculated numerically but replaced by a phenomenological expression , the expressions ( [ jj1 ] ) and ( [ jj2 ] ) remain interesting because they set constraints between the different @xmath66 and @xmath85 , which all depend on the same @xmath67 profile .",
    "we do not give details on the coulomb interaction term @xmath63 which stems directly from eq.([htottild ] ) .",
    "if coulomb blockade in the nanocircuit is already strong in the absence of the cavity , the effect of the cavity on interactions may be disregarded or treated perturbatively . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss another situation where we assume that the effects of @xmath63 are negligible due to the large tunnel rate between a quantum dot and a normal metal reservoir . in the general case",
    ", coulomb interactions between the tunneling charges can lead to a large variety of effects , which we will not discuss in this work .    to conclude , we obtain a decomposition of the system hamiltonian in terms of nanocircuit elements connected by tunnel couplings .",
    "while this is reminiscent of the coarse graining description of superconducting microcircuits frequently used in circuit qed , a full analogy is not possible due to the presence of the orbital degree of freedom in the mesoscopic qed case . due to this orbital degree of freedom , we obtain a large variety of electron / photon coupling terms . in this section ,",
    "we have discussed the case of quantum dot circuits which raises most experimental efforts so far .",
    "however , the above approach can be used for any other type of system in which a decomposition in terms of a tunneling model is relevant .",
    "this includes quantum point contacts , molecular circuits , metallic tunnel junctions , and hybrid superconducting systems enclosing andreev bound states or majorana bound states , for instance .",
    "this last case is discussed in more details in section [ supra ] .      many theoretical works on mesoscopic qed use as a starting basis a tunnel hamiltonian where all parameters ( orbital energies , tunnel rates , ... ) are perturbed by corrections proportional to the cavity electric field .",
    "these empirical approaches lack of a formal justification and can lead to unphysical predictions . our work provides a rigorous framework for the use of tunnelling models with a linear light / matter interaction ( the superconducting case will be discussed explicitly in section [ supra ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned above , our approach proceeds along a spirit similar to the pzw transformation , but with modifications necessary to take into account the specificities of mesoscopic qed , among which a strong space dependence of the cavity electric field on the scale of a nanocircuit , and boundary conditions provided by cavity conductors and voltage - biased dc electrostatic gates .",
    "interestingly , the effect of boundary conditions provided by grounded conductors on the pzw transformation has been discussed recently@xcite .",

    "such a joint measurement has already been realized in the case of a dqd .",

    "qed@xcite . however , since the physical ingredients and measured quantities are different in cavity and mesoscopic qed , it is useful to discuss more specifically the advantages of the photonic pseudo - potential scheme of section [ ppp ] .",
    "the first quantity which is generally measured in mesoscopic qed experiments is the cavity frequency pull for a given cavity mode , which is modified by the nanocircuits coupled to the cavity .",
    "since the minimal coupling scheme and the photonic pseudo - potential scheme are related by a unitary transformation , they must of course predict the same cavity pull .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to check this equivalence for a simple example . here",
    ", we use a simpler approach than in section iv , because we do not need to particularize the effect of the nanocircuit reservoirs and we will not discuss the cavity damping pull .",
    "we consider a cavity coupled to a nanocircuit with unperturbed many electron states @xmath327 which satisfy the general equation @xmath328 with@xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "we discuss the limit where the nanocircuit and the cavity are not resonant i.e. @xmath331 for any @xmath46 and @xmath51 . at second order in the cavity / nanocircuit coupling ( i.e. @xmath332 or @xmath333 )",
    ", an elementary perturbation theory gives the cavity pull @xmath334 with@xmath335 note that @xmath336 depends on the state @xmath337 occupied by the nanocircuit .",
    "this can be used , in principle , for a noninvasive readout of the nanocircuit state in the non - resonant regime@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ pull ] ) can be obtained by using hamiltonian ( [ htottild ] ) or equivalently hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) . in order to check the equivalence between the two approaches , it is necessary to invoke the completeness relation @xmath338 for the nanocircuit states .",
    "interestingly , one can check that the @xmath16 terms in eq.([1 ] ) give a contribution @xmath339 to @xmath336 , which is not negligible for @xmath340 .",
    "we conclude that in the framework of mesoscopic qed where the cavity frequency pull is a central quantity , it is particularly important to eliminate in a rigorous way the @xmath16 terms if one wants to use a linear light / matter coupling .",
    "the photonic pseudo - potential scheme completes such a task .",
    "the cavity frequency pull is not the only means to characterize the interactions between a nanocircuit and a cavity . a more general workout of mesoscopic qed devices requires the knowledge of the matrix elements between the different nanocircuit eigenstates , generated by the cavity photons .",
    "another argument in strong favor of the use of the photonic pseudo - potential scheme is the general relation @xmath341 it indicates that the single - photon coupling elements decay more quickly with @xmath342 in the photonic pseudo - potential scheme . in practice one",
    "often uses a truncated space for the nanocircuit electronic states which is difficult to handle or determine globally .",
    "this is what we do for instance in section iv , where we consider a single orbital quantum dot .",
    "equation ( [ el ] ) shows that in this case it is more accurate to use eq.([htottild ] ) to predict the cavity behavior .",
    "finally , the photonic pseudo - potential scheme involves only photon - independent superconducting gap terms ( see section [ supra ] ) .",
    "this can be another significant advantage considering the already rich structure of the nanocircuit / light coupling in the absence of superconductivity .",
