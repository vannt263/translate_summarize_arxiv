    "one of the most important tasks in hadron physics is to calculate and understand the mass spectrum and the wave functions of physical hadrons from a covariant quantum field theory .",
    "the wave functions encode all the properties which are needed for a phenomenological description of experiments .",
    "wave functions and probability amplitudes have a natural appearance in a hamiltonian approach .",
    "but the hamiltonian bound state problem is notoriously difficult in a field theory .",
    "procedures like those of schwinger and dyson or of bethe and salpeter are not easy to cope with in practice as reviewed recently in @xcite .",
    "actually , the difficulties were considered so enormous that the hamiltonian approach was given up in the fifties alltogether in favor of feynman s action oriented approach .",
    "modern successors like the lattice gauge theories @xcite govern the scene , maturing from infancy in recent times @xcite .",
    "phenomenological models @xcite are closer to experiment and have the different objective to classify the bulk of empirical data .",
    "they leave little doubt that a heavy meson contains primarily a pair of constituent quarks and _ not _ an infinity of sea particles as suggested by the perturbative treatment of quantum field theory .",
    "how can one reconcile these models particularly the constituent quark model ( cqm ) with the quantum field theory of chromodynamics ( qcd ) ?",
    "there are several reasons why the front form  @xcite of hamiltonian dynamics @xcite is one of the very few candidates , see @xcite or @xcite . particularly the simple vacuum and",
    "the simple boost properties @xcite confront with the ` complicated vacuum ' and the ` dynamical boosts ' of the conventional approach , the instant form .",
    "these aspects are stressed also in the arguments of wilson  @xcite and collaborators @xcite .",
    "nowadays we know that even the front form vacuum is not simple  @xcite , but still _ simplier _ than in the instant form : the problem can at least be formulated  @xcite .",
    "the success of discretized light - done quantization ( dlcq ) particularly in 1 + 1 dimensions has stirred hope that its apparent simplicities carry over to the physical 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "but this meets problems , among them : the hamiltonian matrix increases exponentially fast with the particle number of the fock states and with the number of transversal momenta . truncating the fock space to 2 particles like tamm @xcite and dancoff @xcite invokes perturbation theory , violates gauge invariance and generates non - integrable singularities .",
    "one must resort to _ ad hoc _ procedures to make things working @xcite .",
    "truncating to 3 particles @xcite , the numerical results are inconclusive as to test an onset of convergence .",
    "even worse than that : thus far , it is obscure how _ any hamiltonian _ including the one on the light cone could be subjected to a renormalization group analysis .",
    "this and the possibly large coupling constant has motivated wilson @xcite to give up the one - to - one connection with canonical field theory and to propose a radically new procedure in which the renormalization properties of front form operators play the crucial role .",
    "the problem is a very deep one and appears also in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in qed ,",
    "the smallness of the coupling constant obscures the fact that the simple coulomb potential between two point charges has not been derived from field theory thus far with other than perturbative methods .",
    "although higher order effects are expected to be small , and are indeed so , see for example @xcite and @xcite , no manifestly non - perturbative and closed analytical procedures are at hand .",
    "this is remarkable . in qcd the problems",
    "are only accentuated due to the larger coupling constant .    by practical considerations",
    "one must reduce the matrix dimension of the hamiltonian .",
    "but the reduction to comparatively small matrices is more than merely a technical issue .",
    "it becomes _ a matter of principle_. when analyzing the source of the difficulty one realizes that the many - body aspects of a field theory have not been mastered thus far : precisely those are treated in perturbation theory and precisely those are responsible for the large matrix dimensions .",
    "it is here where the present work supposedly contributes .",
    "the many - body aspects are kept in the form as they want to appear , as resolvents , and these _ are not expanded _ as perturbative series .",
    "our point is then : one should solve first the many - body aspects of the canonical hamiltonian , which has not been done thus far , and then think on the problems of renormalization .",
    "this is not in conflict with @xcite , but we emphasize a different aspects of the problem .",
    "one is faced then with problems similar to conventional many - body physics , problems as one meets them in the theory of atoms , nuclei or of solids .",
    "remarkably , one can carry out this programme essentially without assumption , and still arrive at a solvable equation . as a matter of fact it is also simple .    at the core of this work",
    "is a new method , the ` method of iterated resolvents ' to be introduced in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "it allows to do ` perturbation theory to all orders ' and ` perturbation theory in medium ' without a smallness parameter . for to be specific ,",
    "some of the ingredients of earlier work @xcite , particularly the lagrangian and the dlcq - fock - space for qcd , are summarized shortly in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] summarizes the theory of effective interactions as known from the literature @xcite and displays why the tamm - dancoff approach @xcite is bound to fail .",
    "the results of section  [ sec:4 ] are then applied to qcd in section  [ sec:6 ] . at the end of many formal manipulations",
    "one takes the continuum limit .",
    "the effective interaction of a quark and an antiquark will then turn out as a sum of two terms which have an intuitively appealing interpretation : ( 1 ) the effective potential @xmath0 , generated by the exchange of one effective gluon which is absorbed either by the same or by the other quark ; and ( 2 ) the effective annihilation interaction @xmath1 , where the quark and antiquark annihilate into two effective gluons .",
    "the potential @xmath0 is derived explicitly in section  [ sec:7 ] , and section  [ sec:8 ] summarizes the results including a broader discussion on their possible future application .",
    "both in non - relativistic quantum mechanics and in field theory , the hamiltonian operator propagates the system in time . in a covariant theory",
    "the concept of ` time ' can be generalized , since the space - time parametrization is arbitrary .",
    "but following dirac , there are no more than three standard forms how to choose generalized time and the corresponding hamiltonian dynamics : the ` instant ' , the ` front ' and the ` point ' form . in this section",
    "we shall summarize @xcite the front form hamiltonian for qcd , actually for su(n ) ,    the time - like coordinate is chosen as @xmath2 , the space - like coordinates as @xmath3 .",

    "the contraction of these four operators @xmath20 is lorentz _ invariant _ and refered to somewhat improperly but conveniently as the ` light - cone hamiltonian @xmath21 ' @xcite , or shortly @xmath22 .",

    "periodic boundary conditions on @xmath26 can be realized by periodic boundary conditions on the vector potentials @xmath27 and anti - periodic boundary conditions on the spinor fields @xmath28 because @xmath26 is bilinear in the latter .",
    "one expands these fields into plane wave states and satifies the boundary conditions by _ discretizing _ the momenta , hence discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath29 this is done at the expense of introducing two length parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which define a normalization volume @xmath32 .",
    "more explicitly , the free fields are expanded as fourier sums @xmath33 particularly for the two transversal vector potentials @xmath34 , ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "each particle is on its mass - shell @xmath36 .",
    "its four - momentum is @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "each particle state `` @xmath39 '' is then characterized by six quantum numbers : @xmath40 the first three , @xmath41 , specify the space - like momentum and @xmath42 the helicity @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "a quark is specified further by color @xmath7 and flavor @xmath45 .",
    "gluons carry no flavour , and the color index @xmath7 is substituted by the glue index @xmath46 .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath55 , see @xcite and @xcite , and the expansions in eq.([eq:212 ] ) complete the specification of all vector potentials @xmath56 .",
    "the space - like integrations in eq.([eq:208 ] ) can be carried out explicitly , leading essentially to kronecker deltas .",

    "the various terms in the hamiltonian are conveniently classified by a sum of four terms @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58 the kinetic energy @xmath59 survives the limit of the coupling constant @xmath60 going to zero .",
    "since it is diagonal in fock - space representation , its eigenvalue is the _",
    "free invariant mass squared _ of the particular fock state .",
    "the _ vertex interaction _",
    "@xmath61 is the relativistic interaction _ per se_.",
    "it is linear in @xmath62 and changes the particle number by 1 and _ only by _ 1 .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath63 which change the particle number by 3 ( as in the instant form ) are strictly zero in dlcq : the vacuum _ does not fluctuate_. the instantaneous interactions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are gauge artefacts , are consequences of working in the light - cone gauge and proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "the seagull interaction @xmath67 conserves the particle number .",
    "the fork interaction @xmath68 changes the particle number _ only _ by 2 . as illustrated below in figure  [ fig : holy-1 ] , each block in the hamiltonian matrix is therefore either the zero matrix , or has _ only _",

    "there is _ one and only one _ reference state which is annihilated by all destruction operators , namely the _ fock - space vacuum _ @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space for the single - particle creation and annihilation operators is the fock space . it is the complete set of all possible states @xmath70 subject to be eigenfunctions of the space - like momenta , with _ fixed eigenvalues _ @xmath71 and @xmath72 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath73 the sums run over all particles in a fock state . as consequence of discretization , the fock states are denumerable and orthonormal : @xmath74 . as usual , the _ momentum fraction _ carried by the particle is denoted by @xmath75 , and the sum of all fractions is constrained to @xmath76 .",
    "note that the fock states can be made color neutral . since @xmath16 has only positive eigenvalues and since each particle has a lowest possible value of @xmath77 , the number of particles in a fock state is limited for any fixed value of the _ harmonic resolution _",

    "they govern how much the particles can go off their equilibrium values @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "one tends to conclude that the solution of the bound - state problem for a gauge field theory like qcd is solvable on a computer .",

    "diagonalizes the matrix numerically .",
    "here is the bottleneck of the method : sooner or later , the matrix dimension exceeds imagination , and other than in 1 + 1 dimensions one has to develop new tools by matter of principle .",
    "intuitively one aims at something like an effective interaction between a quark and an antiquark , similar to the effective interaction between a negative and a positive point charge .",
    "effective interactions are a well known tool in many - body physics @xcite . to the community",

    "every value of @xmath133 defines a different hamiltonian and a different spectrum . varying @xmath133",
    "one generates a set of _ energy functions _ @xmath140 . whenever one finds a solution to the _ fixpoint equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath141 one has found one of the true eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath23 , by construction .",
    "one should emphasize that one finds this way _ all @xmath119 eigenvalues _ of @xmath22 , see also @xcite , irrespective of how small one chooses the @xmath121-space .",
    "even if one chooses a @xmath142-space with ` matrix ' dimension @xmath143 , the single energy function @xmath144 contains the infomation on _ all _ eigenvalues : the @xmath145 poles of @xmath144 generate the @xmath119 eigenvalues by means of eq.([eq:350 ] ) .",
    "explicit examples for that can be found in @xcite and in appendix  [ sec : c ] .",
    "it looks as if one has mapped a difficult problem , the diagonalization of a huge matrix onto a simplier problem , the diagonalization of a much smaller matrix .",
    "this is true , but not completely .",
    "one has to invert a matrix . in practice ,",
    "the inversion of a matrix is as diffficult as its diagonalization .",
    "in addition , one has to vary @xmath133 and solve the fixpoint equation ( [ eq:350 ] ) .",
    "the numerical work is thus rather larger than smaller as compared to a direct diagonalization .",
    "the advantage of working with the so defined effective interaction is that resolvents can be approximated systematically .",
    "the two resolvents @xmath146 defined once with and once without the non - diagonal interaction in the hamiltonian @xmath147 , respectively , are identically related by @xmath148 that is , by the _ infinite series of perturbation theory_. the point is , of course , that the kinetic energy @xmath59 is a diagonal matrix which can be trivially inverted to get @xmath149 .    after these formal considerations we return to gauge theory and its fock space representations as displayed in figure  [ fig : holy-1 ] .",
    "the identification of the @xmath95-space with the @xmath142-space and the related effective interaction between one constituent ( @xmath39 ) with an other ( @xmath150 ) appears as the most natural thing to do .",
    "but now the trouble starts : like tamm and dancoff @xcite one truncates the above series to the very first term @xmath151 .",
    "but the tamm - dancoff procedure fails for light - cone kinematics : when taken literally , the effective interaction has a non - integrable singularity @xcite .",
    "even worse , simple estimates show that the series in eq.([eq:354 ] ) diverges @xcite order by order , all that irrespective of violating badly gauge invariance due to the truncation .",
    "one has to invent _ ad hoc _ measures to get things working @xcite .",
    "one could try to _ resum the series _ in eq.([eq:354 ] ) at least partially , guided for example , like in quantum electrodynamics , by a smallness assumption on the coupling constant .",
    "when one tries that , one gets lost soon in the murky depths of perturbation theory _ driven to all orders _ , and quits the game .",
    "one the other hand , the procedure displayed in eqs.([eq:320 ] ) to ( [ eq:353 ] ) _ is in principle exact_. maybe one should look at it from an other point of view .",
    "one of the many conclusions might be that the interaction term in the denominator of eq.([eq:352 ] ) should be dealt with in a better way , for example , by the ` method of iterated resolvents ' to be presented next .",
    "dlcq applied to gauge field theory is , as mentioned , particular among matrix diagonalization problems to the extent that a _ finite number _ of fock - space sectors like in figure  [ fig : holy-1 ] appears in the most natural way .",
    "the same holds true for quantum - mechanical @xmath152-body problems where the fock space can be classified in terms of the _ finite number _ of 0-particle-0-hole ( 0-ph ) , 1-ph , @xmath153 , @xmath152-ph sectors , see for example @xcite . in either case the block matrix in sparse .",
    "most of the blocks are zero matrices due to the nature of the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "one should make use of that !    in dlcq one",
    "is confronted with the diagonalization of a _ finite dimensional block matrix _ , for which eq.([eq:320 ] ) represents the example of @xmath154 blocks . the step from eq.([eq:320 ] ) to eq.([eq:345 ] ) can then be interpreted as the reduction of a block matrix dimension from 2 to 1 . as a matter of fact , if one chooses the @xmath124-space identical with last sector @xmath155 in figure  [ fig : holy-1 ] and the @xmath142-space with the rest , @xmath156 , one reduces the block matrix equation from dimension @xmath155 to @xmath157 , with an effective interaction acting in the now smaller space .",
    "this procedure can be repeated , and again iterated , until one arrives at an effective interaction of block matrix dimension @xmath143 , _ with a well defined _",
    "effective interaction in the ` 1'-space .",
    "all that is needed is a reasonable notation @xcite .",
    "suppose , in the course of this reduction , one has arrived at block matrix dimension @xmath105 , with @xmath158 .",
    "denote the corresponding effective interaction @xmath159 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem corresponding to eq.([eq:345 ] ) reads now @xmath160 observe that @xmath161 and @xmath162 refer here to sector numbers .",
    "now , in analogy to eqs.([eq:331 ] ) and ( [ eq:332 ] ) , define @xmath163 respectively . the effective interaction in the ( @xmath164)-space becomes then @xcite @xmath165 for every block matrix element @xmath166 . to get the corresponding eigenvalue equation one substitutes @xmath105 by @xmath167 everywhere in eq.([eq:406 ] ) .",
    "everything proceeds like in section  [ sec:3 ] , including the fixed point equation @xmath168 .",
    "but one has achieved much more : eq.([eq:414 ] ) is a _ recursion relation _ which holds for all @xmath158 ! the only convention one must have , of course , is that one has started from the bare interaction @xmath23 , thus @xmath169 .",
    "the rest is algebra and interpretation .",
    "how can the procedure be interpreted ?",
    "one gets some inspiration from the paradigm of a @xmath170 block matrix as explicitly dealt with in appendix  [ sec : c ] .",
    "the consequences of eq.([eq:414 ] ) are worked out in appendix  [ sec : d ] : when expressed in terms of the bare interaction ( matrices ) @xmath23 and the resolvents @xmath171 , the effective interaction in sector @xmath105 wants to develope _ chains _ like @xmath172 the order of the chains is given by the number of propagators and not , as usual , by the power of the coupling constant .",
    "the maximum order of the chains _ is strictly finite for a finite matrix _ , as opposed to the infinite series of perturbation theory .",
    "the sector numbers in the chains are not arbitrary , but obey the rules tabulated in appendix  [ sec : d ] . for example",
    ", the effective interaction @xmath173 has no propagator with sector number @xmath105 .",
    "this implies that the system _ can not fall back _ , a feature distincly different from the usual perturbative propagators displayed in eq.([eq:352 ] ) .",
    "moreover , most of the chains vanish from the outset for the dlcq - hamiltonian : it suffices that only one of the four bare block matrix elements appearing in eq.([eq:4015 ] ) , namely @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , or @xmath177 is a zero - matrix .",
    "unpleasant is to some extent , that one has to deal with ` resolvents of resolvents ' , or with ` iterated resolvents ' . on the other hand ,",
    "each resolvents represents a resummation of all orders in perturbation theory , and it is this particular aspect which makes them interesting , at least .",

    "the second step , including closure , is not only permitted but also a valid approximation in line with standard many - body technology .",
    "no approximation , however , is involved relating the off - shell mass @xmath246 of the gluon to the other particles in @xmath247 . denoting the single - particle four - momentum of the gluon , the quark , and the antiquark by @xmath248,@xmath249 , and @xmath250 , respectively , only well - known light - cone kinematics is needed to establish that the two four - vectors @xmath251 are identical , and proportional to the time - like vector @xmath252 with @xmath253 .",
    "the identities @xmath254 are then obtained straightforwardly .",
    "some words of caution seem to be in place .",
    "( 1 ) the smallness condition requires that @xmath255 is smaller than the lowest bound state . restraining the transverse momentum of the gluon to be less than the pion",
    "mass is not a serious draw - back .",
    "one should note that the off - shell mass of the gluon can be large irrespective of how well the smallness condition is fulfilled .",

    "the role of @xmath217 becomes more obvious when setting @xmath276 but keeping @xmath277 in eq.([eq:7.0.07 ] ) , @xmath278 expanding @xmath277 to first non - trivial order , picking out a particular term , one gets diagrams like in figure  [ fig:7.2 ] , or formally @xmath279 as mentioned already , a propagator should be represented rather by a box than by a vertical line .",
    "this becomes important when the propagator is diagonal , see eq.([eq:7.0.09 ] ) , _ i.e. _ when it does not change the momenta of the ` in- ' and ` out - states ' .",

    "it is a well established fact , even in light - cone quantization @xcite , that asymptotically holds @xmath316 , with a coefficient @xmath317 well - known from theory and a mass scale @xmath318 which must be determined from experiment .",
    "the only difference between the textbooks and the present approach is , that the coupling function @xmath319 must be calculable down to momentum - transfer zero .",
    "the latter is required when one solves the integral equation .",
    "here is the problem , and here we must leave it , since the explicit calculation of @xmath301 and the subsequent renormalization of @xmath320 to yield a @xmath321 clearly goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "but we have spotted where the problem is .",
    "one should emphasize finally that the knowledge of the @xmath95-space eigenfunction @xmath322 is sufficient to retrieve all desired fock - space components of the total wavefunction @xmath323 .",
    "the key is the upwards recursion relation eq.([eq:411 ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath324 obviously , one can express the higher fock - space components @xmath325 as functionals of @xmath326 by a finite series of quadratures ( or matrix multiplications ) .",
    "one does not have to solve another eigenvalue problem .",
    "in order to show this , we ask for the probabilty amplitude to find a @xmath327 or a @xmath196 state in a particular meson @xmath224 as an example .",
    "with @xmath328 the first two relevant equations of ( [ eq:7.3.a ] ) are @xmath329 note that @xmath330 is expressed already in terms of @xmath331 .",
    "the sector hamiltonians @xmath332 have been dealt with in sections  [ sec:4 ] and  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "they can be expressed by chains with the bare interaction @xmath63 , particularly @xmath333 and @xmath334 . with the abbreviation @xmath335 and the ` selection rules ' of figure  [ fig : holy-2 ]",
    "one gets @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , and therefore @xmath339 one should emphasize again that these expressions are exact to all orders in the coupling constant .",
    "the propagators have to be treated like exposed in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "they include the running coupling constant and in the solution are independent of @xmath133 .",
    "obviously , the procedure is straightforward , well - defined , and actually simple .",
    "in the present work , one adopts the point of view that most , if not all , properties of a lagrangian gauge field theory are contained in the canonical front - form hamiltonian , which is calculated in the light - cone gauge omitting the zero modes .",
    "periodic boundary conditions allow to construct explicitly the hamiltonian matrix for fixed harmonic resolution .",
    "rows and columns of this matrix refer to all possible momentum states of 2 , 3 , or more particles .",
    "all variables are well defined , finite and denumerable : the total longitudinal momentum and the harmonic resolution are finite , the number of states and the number of sectors are finite , and last but not least every single matrix element of the hamiltonian is finite .",
    "one is confronted with the diagonalization of a finite block matrix and applies the theory of effective interactions in conjunction with the method of iterated resolvents .",
    "as shown , one can map the large hamiltonian matrix without smallness assumption onto a matrix problem with much smaller dimensions , to the problem of diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath100-space .",
    "it is shown why _ these two matrices have the same eigenvalues_. at the end , the periodic boundary conditions are relaxed by the limiting process of going over to the continuum limit .",
    "the diagrammatic representation of the effective interaction as given in figure  [ fig:7.1 ] looks like second order diagrams of perturbation theory . but",
    "despite this , they are far from being that : due to the vertex function ( which after renormalization is related to the running coupling constant ) , they represent a resummation of pertubative graphs to all orders in the bare coupling constant .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath0 is computed explicitly in section  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "it is our understanding that @xmath340 represents an exact mapping of the full many - body hamiltonian onto the @xmath95 space . solving for the eigenfunctions in this space one can retrieve all other many - body amplitudes of the wavefunction in a self - consistent way , as shown in section  [ sec:7 ] .    to arrive at this simple result it is crucial to include arbitrarily many gluons .",
    "only then , as argued in section  [ sec:6 ] , the russian puppet structure of ` resolvents within resolvents ' can be used as an argument why the effective interaction is the same in all hierarchies .",
    "it is precisely this aspect of self - similarity in a gauge theory which ultimately allows for the ` breaking of the hierarchy ' : in the solution , the particles propagate like free particles and all many - body aspects reside in the vertex coupling function .",
    "one can overstress the point for qed by stating that the generation of the simple coulomb potential requires infinitely many photons .",
    "finally , one should emphasize that the present approach needs no ` convergence - improving ' external potential as in @xcite , which once introduced is so difficult to get rid - off .",
    "the average potential generates itself , in the solution .    the present work claims to connect a lagrangian gauge field theory with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a bound state equation .",
    "we like to emphasize that all steps can be ( dis-)verified numerically in a well defined manner .",
    "one can start with a sufficiently large dlcq - hamiltonian matrix , as large as the computer can digest .",
    "the reduction to the effective hamiltonian can then be done by successive matrix inversions and multiplications as described in sections  [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the prediction is that the lower eigenvalues depend only weakly on the starting point energy .",
    "in addition , one can ( dis-)verify numerically _ a posteriori _ how well the succesive approximations from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:57 ] ) to ( [ eq:58 ] ) to ( [ eq:59 ] ) are satisfied in practice .",
    "important as the present work might be , it only can be the first step .",
    "the resulting effective potential depends on several formal and unphysical parameters , among them the harmonic resolution @xmath93 and the transversal length @xmath341 induced both by the periodic boundary conditions , the cut - off scale @xmath282 regulating the transversal momenta , and finally the smallness parameters @xmath342 and @xmath255 . the resolution and",
    "the length disappear when going to the continuum limit .",
    "but the dependence on @xmath282 , @xmath342 and @xmath255 remains .",
    "the second , and perhaps even more important step , must therefore be to remove them by a renormalization group analysis @xcite .",
    "this has not been done , yet .",
    "the present work thus culminates and ends at a pre - renormalization stage .",
    "the merit of the present work is to pinpoint the object of renormalization , namely the vertex function which is given here for the first time in a non - perturbative formulation to all orders in the coupling constant .    but even before a future renormalization group analysis the present formalism is useful and has some rather nice aspects : even without knowing the explicit structure of the running coupling constant in the infinite momentum frame one can do some educated guess work . for example , using richardson s version @xcite of the running coupling constant one can establish confinement in a parameter - free fashion .",
    "one can approximately , but analytically , calculate the heavy meson masses based on the parametric variation of a trial wave function @xcite .",
    "an explicit , but numerical , solution of the same problem is currently being attempted @xcite .",
    "last but not least one can choose the smallness parameters @xmath255 so small that no transversal momenta survive at all .",
    "one then ends up with a ` collinear model ' @xcite similar to the dimensionally reduced models solved thus far  @xcite , resulting in stupendous analytical properties of the light mesons @xcite .",
    "these features make it worth to communicate the present work even prior to a renormalizaton group analysis .    .",

    "the considerations in section  [ sec:4 ] can be substantiated with an explicit example . the rows and columns of any finite dimensional matrix",
    "can be grouped into four blocks .",
    "the block matrix has then the following shape : @xmath343 the reduction from the @xmath170 to the @xmath6 matrix is easy : since @xmath344 , one replaces all bare block matrix elements in the @xmath6 matrix by @xmath345 , with @xmath346 next , reduce the matrix of block matrix dimension 3 to the one of block matrix dimension 2 , by @xmath347 . inserting @xmath348 from eq.([eq:502b ] ) , one gets @xmath349 performing reduction and substitution once more one arrives at @xmath350 one has thus expressed the matrix elements of the effective interaction in sector 1 in terms of the bare interaction @xmath22 and the resolvents @xmath351 , @xmath352 , and @xmath353 , which in turn are given by the effective interactions @xmath354 , @xmath348 and @xmath355 , respectively , _ i.e. _ @xmath356 note that all operations are well defined matrix multiplications and inversions .",
    "the _ bare interactions _ @xmath23 alternate with the resolvents of _ effective interactions _ @xmath357 to build up _ strictly finite chains_. the longest chain in eq.([eq:506b ] ) has 5 propagators : @xmath358 .",

    "the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath305-space therefore has the structure of a continued fraction : @xmath367 one can test the method of iterated resolvents in an almost trivial way : assume that each of the blocks in eq.([eq:508c ] ) has dimension 1 .",
