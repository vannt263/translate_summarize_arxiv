    "recent analyses of pulsar proper motion ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ; lorimer et al .",
    "1997 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ) , observation of pulsar bow shocks ( cordes et al .",
    "1993 ) , and studies of pulsar - supernova remnant associations ( frail et al .",
    "1994 ) indicate that supernova explosions are asymmetric and the neutron stars receive large kick velocities at birth ( @xmath4@xmath5 kms@xmath2 on average , but possibly with a significant population having velocities greater than @xmath6 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "compelling evidence for supernova asymmetry also comes from the detection of geodetic precession in psr 1913 + 16 ( cordes et al .  1990 ) and orbital plane precession in the psr j0045 - 7319/b star binary ( kaspi et al .",
    "in addition , evolutionary considerations of neutron star binary population also imply the existence of pulsar kicks ( e.g. , fryer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "two classes of mechanisms for the natal kicks of pulsars have been suggested .",
    "the first class relies on local hydrodynamic instabilities in the proto - neutron stars ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; burrows & hayes 1996 ; janka & mller 1996 ) as well as global asymmetric perturbations seeded in the presupernova cores ( goldreich et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the asymmetries in matter and temperature distributions lead to asymmetric explosion and/or asymmetric neutrino emission , although the magnitude of the resulting kick velocity is still unclear .    in this _ letter _ , we focus on the second class of models in which the large pulsar velocities arise from asymmetric neutrino emission induced by strong magnetic fields . although a number of papers have been written on this subject ( chugai 1984 ; dorofeev et al .",
    "1985 ; binovatyi - kogan 1993 ; vilenkin 1995 ; horowitz & piekarewicz 1997 ; horowitz & li 1997 ) , they are unsatisfactory for a number of reasons : they either failed to identify the most relevant neutrino emission / interaction processes or the relevant physical conditions in proto - neutron stars , or stopped at estimating the magnetic field effects on neutrino opacities , and none of them treated neutrino transport in any systematic manner . as a result ,",
    "their estimates of the kick velocity that may be produced are unreliable .",
    "we have carried out systematic studies of neutrino transport in strong magnetic fields ( lai & qian 1998a , b ) in order to pin down the magnitude of the magnetic field effects on neutrino transport and pulsar kicks . here",
    "we report our most important finding on the macroscopic consequence of asymmetric neutrino opacities due to parity violation in weak interactions .",
    "more details can be found in our forthcoming publication ( lai & qian 1998a , hereafter lq ) .",
    "in the presence of an external magnetic field , the differential opacity for neutrino - nucleon scattering , @xmath7 can be written in the form : ( d_e^d)_ = 14_e^ , [ scat ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the unit momentum vectors for the incoming and outgoing neutrinos , respectively , @xmath10 is the unit vector along the magnetic field direction , and @xmath11 is the total scattering opacity without magnetic field ( the subscript `` e '' implies that the opacity depends on the neutrino energy @xmath12 ) .",
    "the presence of the @xmath10-depedent terms in eq .",
    "( [ scat ] ) implies that there is a preferred direction in the opacity .",
    "this is a manifestation of parity violation in weak interactions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related to the nucleon polarization @xmath15 by _",
    "= 2pc_a(c_a - c_v)c_v^2 + 3c_a^2 ,   _",
    "= -2pc_a(c_a+c_v)c_v^2 + 3c_a^2 , where @xmath16 for neutron and @xmath17 for proton ( raffelt & seckel 1995 ) . for nondegenerate nucleons ,",
    "the spin polarization @xmath15 is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the nucleon magnetic moment ( @xmath20 for neutron and @xmath21 for proton ) , and @xmath22 is the field strength in units of @xmath23 g. in the degenerate regime , we have @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the nucleon chemical potential ( or fermi energy ) .",
    "a general expression for @xmath15 is given in lq . in proto - neutron stars",
    ", one should average eq .",
    "( [ scat ] ) over composition ( neutrons and protons ) .",
    "it is also important to note that the differential opacity for @xmath26 scattering on nucleons is obtained by interchanging @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ scat ] ) as a result of the crossing symmetry of the leading order matrix elements .",
    "the neutrino absorption opacity is also asymmetric , i.e. , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "however , in the bulk interior of the neutron star , this asymmetry is exactly canceled by the asymmetry in emission ( see  4 ) .",
    "one also expects asymmetry in @xmath31 .",
    "however , for relativistic degenerate electrons , the @xmath32-@xmath33 opacity is much smaller than the @xmath32-@xmath34 opacity , while the electron polarization @xmath35 is of the same order as @xmath15 for nucleons .",
    "therefore the contribution from @xmath32-@xmath33 scattering to asymmetric neutrino transport is small compared with that from @xmath32-@xmath34 scattering .",
    "the asymmetry coefficients ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) in the opacity are extremely small even at @xmath36",
    ". however , cumulative effect due to multiple scatterings can enhance the asymmetry in neutrino emission . to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we consider a simple toy problem in which neutrinos leak out of a slab ( with infinite extent perpendicular to the @xmath37-axis which coincides with the magnetic axis ) via biased diffusion , i.e. , the neutrino scattering probability has the form @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the angle between the @xmath37-axis and the direction of neutrino propagation after each scattering .",
    "the evolution of the neutrino number density @xmath41 is governed by the fokker - planck equation : = 13c^2n- 13 c(n ) , [ diff ] where @xmath42 is the ( constant ) mean free path of the neutrino .",
    "the surfaces of the slab are located at @xmath43 ( so @xmath44 is the total optical depth of the slab ) .",
    "suppose we start with a uniform distribution @xmath45 at @xmath46 ( so that there is no initial asymmetry ) .",
    "as neutrinos gradually diffuse out , the profile @xmath41 becomes increasingly asymmetric , and the flux asymmetry @xmath47 grows ( where @xmath48 is the sum of the fluxes from both surfaces and @xmath49 is the difference ) . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the `` cooling '' front reaches the center of the slab , and @xmath47 saturates to constant value , @xmath51 ( valid for @xmath52 ) .",
    "this constant value can be derived analytically from a quasi - steady - state analysis .",
    "the fractional asymmetry in the total neutrino radiation energy is @xmath53 . in proto - neutron stars ,",
    "the neutrino optical depth @xmath54 is large .",
    "a rough estimate can be made by setting the diffusion time @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the neutron star radius ) to @xmath57s ( the spread in the arrival time of sn 1987a neutrinos was @xmath58s ) , which gives @xmath59 .",
    "this would imply a large enhancement in neutrino emission asymmetry .",
    "several complications arise when one applies the result of the toy problem to real neutron stars : as shown in  4 , the asymmetry in neutrino flux is determined by the coefficient @xmath60 and the local neutrino energy distribution function . due to the crossing symmetry",
    ", we have @xmath61 . because @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the same local energy distribution function , the `` drift fluxes '' ( see eq .",
    "[ [ fe ] ] ) associated with @xmath62 and @xmath63 exactly cancel .",
    "the `` drift fluxes '' of @xmath64 and @xmath65 do not cancel because a newly - formed neutron star is lepton - rich , i.e. , it contains more @xmath64 than @xmath65 , and the typical energy of @xmath64 is also different from @xmath65 . as the neutron star is deleptonized , the difference between @xmath64 and @xmath65 becomes smaller , and we expect the asymmetry in the total neutrino flux to gradually diminish .",
    "another issue which is not clear from the toy problem concerns the role of neutrino absorption : for electron - type neutrinos , absorption is more important than scattering ( by a factor of a few ) in the deleptonization phase .",
    "does the neutrino absorption completely wipe out the asymmetry associated with multiple scatterings ?",
    "we now describe our calculation of the thermal evolution of proto - neutron stars in the presence of the asymmetric neutrino opacities discussed in  2 .",
    "we start from the general transport equation for the spectral intensity @xmath66 of a given neutrino species : + i_e = _",
    "e^(i_e^(fd)-i_e ) + ( 1-f_e)()_ i_ed -i_e()_ ( 1-f_e)d , [ ie ] where",
    "@xmath67 , @xmath68 is the neutrino occupation number , and @xmath69 is the fermi - dirac distribution function for neutrinos : i_e^(fd)(t)=c4u_e^(fd)= e^3(2)^31e^(e-_)/t+1 ( @xmath70 is the corresponding energy density ) , with matter temperature @xmath71 and neutrino chemical potential @xmath72 . in eq .",
    "( [ ie ] ) the absorption opacity @xmath73 already includes the effect of stimulated absorption of neutrinos .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ie ] ) by @xmath8 and then integrating over @xmath8 , we obtain the first order moment equation : _ e = -c3_e^(t)u_e + _ a_e^3_e^(t ) c(u_e^(fd)-u_e)+(_-_)_e^3_e^(t ) cu_e(1-f_e ) , [ fe ] where @xmath74 is the spectral energy density and flux , and @xmath75 is the total opacity .",
    "the neutrino number flux is simply given by @xmath76 .",
    "equation ( [ fe ] ) reveals that in addition to the usual `` diffusive '' flux ( the first term ) , there is a `` drift '' flux ( the @xmath10-dependent terms ) along the magnetic field direction due to the asymmetric neutrino opacities .",
    "note that when @xmath77 ( i.e. , when neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium with matter ) , the asymmetric absorption opacity does not contribute to the drift flux , since in this case asymmetric emission exactly cancels asymmetric absorption . in the following",
    "we shall focus on the bulk interior of the star ( below the layer where neutrinos decouple from the matter ) , where @xmath78 for @xmath64 has the fermi - dirac form with chemical potential @xmath79 , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 have zero chemical potential .    for a given neutrino species @xmath82",
    ", the total opacity can be written in the form @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is a fiducial energy ) .",
    "in general , because of nucleon degeneracy and/or neutrino degeneracy , there can be additional @xmath12-dependence in the prefactor @xmath85 ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) . in these cases ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath85 at an appropriate mean neutrino energy . if we make a further assumption that @xmath64 and @xmath65 have the same form of opacities ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) , then an analytical expression for the total energy flux ( integrated over neutrino energy ) associated with @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be obtained : _ _ e+_|_e =- c e_0 ^ 26 ^ 2_+12 ^ 2_c t^4(_^33+^2_3 ) , [ fluxe]where we have defined @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ fluxe ] ) we have used the relation @xmath89 and @xmath90 . similarly , the net electron lepton number flux is given by @xmath91 we shall group @xmath92 and @xmath93 together and denote them as @xmath80 .",
    "with opacity @xmath94 , the total energy flux carried by these neutrinos is given by _",
    "= -ce_0 ^ 218_t^2 .",
    "as noted earlier , the drift flux associated with @xmath95-type neutrinos is zero .",
    "the equations governing the thermal evolution of a proto - neutron star can be written as @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the lepton number fraction ( @xmath98 is the baryon number density ) , and @xmath99 is the internal energy density of the medium ( a sum of contributions from neutrinos , electrons , positrons , photons , and nucleons ) .",
    "note that inside the star , @xmath100-equilibrium holds to a good approximation , thus we have @xmath101  mev ( @xmath102 do not include rest mass ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we have neglected gravitational contraction and have adopted a newtonian treatment .",
    "we assume a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath37-direction throughout the neutron star .",
    "when the asymmetry is small , we can expand @xmath103 and @xmath104 as t(,t)=t_0(r , t)+t(r , t ) ,   y_l(,t)=y_l0(r , t)+y_l(r , t ) , and similarly for other relevant quantities .",
    "the angular dependence can then be factored out .",
    "we solve the evolutionary equations numerically using an explicit finite difference code .",
    "our model neutron star has a mass @xmath105 and a radius @xmath106 km , with a density profile resembling a @xmath107 polytrope ( the central density is @xmath108 g@xmath109 ) . the initial temperature and @xmath110 profiles are shown in fig .  1",
    ". in the stellar interior",
    ", we have @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "the temperature is @xmath113 mev in the inner core ( @xmath114 ) and reaches @xmath115 mev in the outer core due to shock heating .",
    "these initial conditions are typical of those found in core collapse simulations .",
    "the initial chemical potentials of various particles at the center are @xmath116mev , @xmath117mev , @xmath118mev , and @xmath119mev .",
    "we assume that there is no asymmetry at @xmath46 .",
    "we adopt the zero boundary condition @xmath120 at the stellar surface .",
    "since the neutrino flux asymmetry mainly accumulates in the interior of the star , our crude treatment of the surface boundary condition is adequate .",
    "figure 1 depicts the @xmath121 profiles and the asymmetric perturbations ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) as functions of time for a magnetic field of strength @xmath124 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath125 and @xmath126 profiles is similar to that found by burrow & lattimer ( 1986 ) : the deleptonization phase ( @xmath127 s ) is dominated by the lepton number diffusion . in this early phase a heat wave moves inward , raising the core temperature .",
    "this is followed by a thermal cooling phase in which the core temperature decreases gradually due to energy diffusion .",
    "the asymmetries in the temperature and lepton number profiles increase during the deleptonization phase , reaching a maximum at @xmath128 s ( this behavior is analogous to that found in the toy problem discussed in  3 ) .",
    "this growth of asymmetry is also reflected by the increase in the ratio @xmath129 ( where @xmath130 is the luminosity , and @xmath131 is the net @xmath37-momentum carried away by the neutrinos per unit time ) as shown in fig .",
    "as the neutron star becomes more lepton - depleted , the difference ( in number and energy ) between @xmath64 and @xmath65 diminishes , and the asymmetry gradually declines .",
    "2(c ) shows the asymmetry in the integrated neutrino luminosity [ @xmath132 as a function of time .",
    "the asymmetry in the total radiated neutrino energy is @xmath133 .",
    "this result is smaller than suggested by the toy problem (  3 ) mainly because the energy carried away by electron neutrinos during the deleptonization phase is only about @xmath134 of the total neutrino energy released . in addition",
    ", geometric factors and cancellation of asymmetries associated with neutrons and protons tend to reduce the total asymmetry in neutrino emission .",
    "in this paper , we have identified the most efficient way of generating natal pulsar kicks based on asymmetric neutrino emission induced by magnetic fields .",
    "the key point of this mechanism is parity violation in weak interactions .",
    "the resulting pulsar kick velocity is v_kick1000(0.084 ) ( e_tot10 ^ 53erg ) ( 1.4m_m ) 214(b_z10 ^ 14 g ) ( e_tot310 ^ 53erg ) ( 1.4m_m)kms^-1 , where @xmath135 is the total energy released by neutrinos ( of all species ) from the proto - neutron star , and @xmath136 is the ( averaged ) ordered component of the magnetic field in the star . in reality , rotation ( if it is misaligned with the magnetic axis ) tends to reduce the kick velocity .",
    "we also note that the asymmetric @xmath64 and @xmath65 emission from the proto - neutron star would give rise to asymmetric neutrino heating behind the stalled shock in the delayed supernova mechanism .",
    "this asymmetric heating could lead to asymmetric supernova explosions .",
    "another related ( but distinct ) kick mechanism relies on the fact that @xmath64 and @xmath65 absorption opacities near the neutrinosphere depend on the local magnetic field strength ( due to quantization of @xmath137 and @xmath138 energy levels ) .",
    "if the magnitude of magnetic field in the north pole is different from that in the south pole , then asymmetric neutrino flux can be generated .",
    "we have shown in lai & qian ( 1998b ) that this kick mechanism requires a much larger field strength than the mechanism considered in this letter .",
    "it is plausible that magnetic fields stronger than @xmath139 g can be generated in proto - neutron stars ( thompson & duncan 1993 ) , and several pieces of evidence ( albeit tentative ) have been suggested in the literature ( e.g. , vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ) . while hydrodynamically - driven kick mechanisms may still be viable , ( depending on the magnitude of asymmetry seeded in the presupernova core ) , the possibility that a significant number of pulsars have kick velocities greater than 1000kms@xmath2 ( e.g. , cordes & chernoff 1998 ) may well require large magnetic fields ( @xmath139 g ) to be present in proto - neutron stars .",
