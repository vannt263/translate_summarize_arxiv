    "it is generally believed that the universe , evolving from the initial big bang , underwent a series of symmetry - breaking phase transitions @xcite accompanied by the creation of topological defects , frustrations of the unbroken phase within the broken one , induced by continuity of the order parameter values .",
    "these defects appear as magnetic monopoles , cosmic strings , domain walls and textures .",
    "direct experimental tests of these ideas are unfeasible , but transitions described by similar equations occur in experimentally accessible condensed matter systems , and a new trend has unfolded which compares these two systems .",
    "this `` cosmology in the laboratory '' relies on the fact that the dynamics of phase transitions lie in universality classes and the cosmological ones are hence analogous to those of condensed matter .",
    "for instance , vortices created in the superfluid phase transitions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been studied experimentally ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for extensive discussions ) following an earlier suggestion in which common features with cosmic strings have been noted @xcite .",
    "similarities between cosmological phase transitions and the isotropic - nematic phase transition in liquid crystals were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . analogy with the thermodynamics and transitions in polymer chains was drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the case of superconductors is of particular interest as the associated phase transition involves a local gauge symmetry - breaking process .    in superconductors ,",
    "cosmic strings manifest themselves as flux tubes or vortices .",
    "experiments aimed to observe defect densities in high-@xmath2 materials @xcite have lead to contradictory results with respect to the density predicted by the kibble - zurek ( k - z ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "this prediction is however accurate only for global gauge symmetry breaking , a situation where the geodesic rule for phase angle summation is valid . a local gauge treatment by hindmarsh - rajantie ( h - r ) @xcite identifies a new mechanism for defect generation , which leads to a prediction well below the first carmi - polturak experiment sensitivity , although the prediction for the second one is in reasonable agreement with observation .",
    "the above experiments were both conducted in type - ii materials , which exhibit a second order phase transition .",
    "the question naturally arises as to the extent of changes in the defect density predictions for type - i superconductors .",
    "this is the motivation for our work .",
    "distinction between type - i and type - ii superconductors is traditionally made through the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) parameter @xmath3 , the ratio between the magnetic field penetration length , @xmath4 , and the order parameter ( scalar field ) coherence length , @xmath5 .",
    "these characteristic length scales are obtained , in the presence of a gauge field @xmath6 , from the free energy density    f ( ) = 1 2m_e |i - e c |^2 + v ( ) + 1 2 ( )  , [ free ]    where @xmath7 is the magnetic moment of the specimen , @xmath8 is the electron mass and @xmath9 is the order parameter . the g - l potential is usually written as @xcite    v ( ) = ^2 + 2 ^4  , [ pot ]    where @xmath10 is assumed to depend linearly on the temperature , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants , and @xmath2 is the critical temperature .",

    "these results are then used to analyze the impact of the cubic term on the k - z and the h - r predictions for type - i superconductors , namely on the models themselves and on a possible nucleation suppression due to the slowing down of the transition induced by the potential barrier .",
    "a first - order superconductive phase transition manifests supercritical fields under variation of the temperature , as shown in figure [ curves ] . the superheating curve is given by the condition @xmath29 , for a certain value of @xmath30 .",

    "the electron mass determines the conversion as it is absent from the kinetic term of the lagrangean density of field theory , @xmath54 , while present in the corresponding condensed matter free energy term , @xmath55 ( or , equivalently , in the coherence length : @xmath56 _ vs. _ @xmath57 ) .",

    "( [ free ] ) , this translates into an unimportant correction to the scalar field mass , plus a negative cubic term , given by @xmath62 .",
    "this term implies a shift in the superheating temperature ( at zero field ) , of    _ t = 7.25 10 ^ -12 t_c^3 h_c(0)^2 _ 0 ^ 6  , [ deltat ]    with @xmath63 in _ gauss _ and @xmath19 in @xmath64 .",
    "this shift lies beyond experimental accessibility , since it requires a temperature sensitivity of @xmath65 ( for al ; @xmath66 for sn ) .",
    "however , such an experiment _ might _ be performed with al , using state of the art relative temperature measurement techniques .",
    "surprisingly , for both materials the slopes of @xmath43 predicted by tft and ref . @xcite",
    "have similar magnitudes , @xmath67 .",
    "this is an indication of the analogous underlying mechanisms behind them : the thermal averaging of the gauge field in condensed matter can be thought of as equivalent to finite temperature vacuum polarization in high energy physics ( expressed by the renormalization of 1-loop feynmann diagrams ) .",
    "let us now discuss some possible implications of the inclusion of the cubic term in the mean - field potential .",
    "since temperature sensitivity measurements constrain @xmath68 , we always assume @xmath69 .",
    "the k - z mechanism predicts a density of topological defects ( vortices ) , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the characteristic time scale , given by the gorkov equation , @xmath72 is the quench time , and @xmath73 is a critical exponent .",
    "moreover , it rests upon the assumption that there is a single topological defect per @xmath74 area and , therefore , one must look for changes induced in this quantity .",
    "however , since the characteristic scales of the problem are obtained via linearization of the g - l equations , close to @xmath2 and when the order parameter is small , we see _ no _ changes in this prediction .",
    "on the other hand , for a thin slab of of width @xmath75 , the h - r mechanism predicts a defect density of the order @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the domain size immediately after the transition .",
    "this quantity is related to the highest wavenumber @xmath78 to fall out of equilibrium and is obtained from the adiabaticity relation    = ^2(k )  , [ dispersion ] for a given dispersion relation @xmath79 . in the underdamped case , @xmath80 , with a photon mass given by @xmath81 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath82{\\al'e^{2}/\\be\\ta_q}$ ] , and hence @xmath83 . here , the introduction of a cubic term in the potential will change the photon mass , as the true vacuum shifts to    = -3 + 4  .",
    "[ field ]    however , since @xmath84 , the effect of the cubic term is too small to significantly change the h - r result .",
    "another effect related to metastability concerns the non - vanishing probability of the order parameter to quantum tunnel from the the symmetric ( false ) vacuum towards the non - symmetric vacuum . following refs .",
    "@xcite , the rate of transition per unit volume and time to the true vacua is given , in the thin wall approximation , by    = t^4(s_3 2  t)^3/2e^-s_3/t  , [ decayingrate ]    where    s_3(t ) = 281 1 ^7 ^9(t ) ^2(t ) [ thinwall ] is the euclidean action , and @xmath85 is the  depth \" of the true vacuum .",
    "the thin wall approximation is valid whenever the barrier s height is much greater than @xmath86 .",
    "this is true when @xmath43 is comparable to the other parameters , namely when @xmath87 . for eventually smaller values of @xmath43 , like those predicted by tft and ref .",
    "@xcite , the approximation fails .",
    "in fact , we have shown that the current temperature sensitivity of @xmath88 only allows values of @xmath89 smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , we must conclude that the barrier s height is not comparable to the true vacuum s depth , and the field should always tunnel through it ( i.e. with a probability close to unity ) .",
    "because of this , there is no concern that defects may not have time to nucleate within the resolution time of the measuring device , as would happen if the potential barrier were high and diminished too slowly .",
    "in this work we have examined a possible description of a type - i superconductive phase transition by introducing a cubic term in the g - l mean - field potential , inspired by a gauge field thermal averaging @xcite , and also by analogy with tft .",
    "our analysis of the bounds derived from the superheating field and temperature constraints clearly show that the contribution of any cubic term is small compared to other parameters in the g - l potential .",
    "thus the following conclusions can be drawn : first , the superheating temperature shift induced by a cubic term , derived either from ref .",
    "@xcite or from tft , increases with decreasing g - l parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath91 ; @xmath92 ) .",
    "this suggests that future experiments to search for a tft cubic term should be conducted with extreme ( @xmath93 ) type - i materials , for example @xmath10-tungsten , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , the shift in the supercritical field might be reinvestigated using a dc squid , which currently possess a sensitivity of @xmath96 , or @xmath97 over a 10 @xmath98 m grain diameter .    furthermore , the impact of any cubic term on the defect density predictions of k - z @xcite or h - r @xcite is negligible , with no suppression or slowing down of defect production because the potential barrier due to @xmath43 is not sufficient to prevent nucleation .",
    "these considerations suggest that , all else being equal , experiments to detect topological defect formation in type - i superconductors would observe a reduction of the predicted h - r defect densities by @xmath99 depending on choice of material .",
    "recent calculations @xcite however suggest that the defect structure formed in type - i materials survives significantly longer than in type - ii .",
    "given that the type - i estimate is of order @xmath100 seconds , it seems possible that the disadvantage in @xmath5 might be compensated by simple measurability .",
    "including the presence of a magnetic field with a @xmath9 dependent magnetic moment , the conditions for the reduced superheating field @xmath101 are                                                the authors wish to thank lus bettencourt , arttu rajantie , mark hindmarsh and boris shapiro for helpful suggestions and valuable insights on various aspects of this paper .",
