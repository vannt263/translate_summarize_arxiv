    "a traditional goal of population genetics is to understand the relationship between darwinian selection and evolution .",

    "one approach is to use the numbers of site polymorphisms between and within a pair of closely related species at a genetic locus ( mcdonald and kreitman @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "sawyer and hartl @xcite developed a poisson random field ( prf ) model for these counts that can be used to estimate the amounts of selection that are occurring at individual loci ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite used a time - dependent prf model to estimate the time since a hypothetical sudden change in human population size .",

    "first , a brief introduction to genetics and population genetics . the genetic material or dna of most living creatures is located in one or more chromosomes .",
    "a  chromosome can be thought of as a long string of letters from the alphabet a , c , g , t , where each letter corresponds to a specific nucleotide .",
    "most higher plants and animals are _ diploid _ , which means that their dna is arranged in pairs of chromosomes .",
    "each of these paired chromosomes typically has double - stranded dna , amounting to four dna strands for each chromosome pair .",
    "the nucleotides on the two dna strands of each chromosome are mirrored as a way of providing redundant information .",
    "creatures with nonpaired chromosomes ( such as bacteria and viruses ) are called _",
    "haploid_. a _ gene _ or _ genetic locus _ is a relatively - short segment of a chromosome that affects a particular trait or set of traits . _",
    "random mating _ for a population of @xmath0 diploid individuals , along with mendel s laws for the offspring of two diploid individuals , can be statistically approximated by random sampling with replacement of @xmath1 haploid individuals to form the next generation .",
    "that is , random mating of @xmath0 diploid individuals is approximated by random mating of their @xmath1 haploid genomes .",
    "proteins are built from peptides , which are strings of amino acids .",
    "peptide strings are created by reading a sequence of _ codons _ , which are consecutive triples of nucleotides , from one or more subsegments of a gene .",
    "one amino acid is added to the peptide for each codon of dna .",
    "( the amino acids and codons have no chemical similarity to one another . )",
    "there are around twenty different amino acids as opposed to @xmath2 possible codons on one dna strand , so that the mapping of codons to amino acids can not be one to one . about half of amino acids are encoded by four different codons that vary in the third codon position . most of the remaining amino acids are encoded by two different codons . a mutation at one of the three sites in a codon position",
    "is called a _",
    "silent _ mutation if the resulting new codon encodes the same amino acid .",
    "a site mutation that results in a different amino acid is called a _",
    "replacement _ mutation .",
    "most mutations at first and second position sites in codons are replacement , while mutations at the third position can be either silent or replacement .",
    "the majority of replacement mutations severely damage the gene product and may be lethal to the host , but a substantial number have mild to moderate effects and can be advantageous .",
    "a dna site is _ polymorphic _ in a population if there is more than one nucleotide at that site .",
    "if there is only one nucleotide at that site in a population , the site is _ monomorphic _ and the population is _ fixed _ at that nucleotide .",
    "the _ fitness _ of a gene is defined as the expected relative number of surviving offspring ( genes ) in the next generation that are descendants of that gene , assuming constant lifetimes for individuals .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath3 haploid individuals that are of one of two types @xmath4 or @xmath5 at a particular site or gene , where @xmath5 is the mutant type and @xmath4 is the pre - existing or `` wild type . ''",

    "we first derive two results that lead to poisson random fields ( see below ) for the distribution of site polymorphisms in a limiting infinitely large random - mating population .",
    "the population results can not be directly applied to data , both because we can not sample the entire population and also because the results imply that there are an infinitely large number of site polymorphisms in each gene , most of which have very small population frequencies ( see below ) .",
    "however , we can use the population results to derive the distribution of sample statistics for aligned dna sequences arising from two related but not too distantly related species .",
    "the sample statistics will turn out to be independent poisson with means depending on population parameters for mutation and selection rates .",
    "these , in turn , lead to likelihood methods for the estimation of mutation , selection and divergence time parameters .",
    "the proofs of the population results are deferred to sections [ sec4][sec8 ] .",
    "mathematically , the key steps in the proofs of both of the main population results depend on trotter s theorem for the dual process of a diffusion process ( section [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "the sampling formulas are discussed in sections [ sec22 ] and [ sec23 ] with the details in section  [ sec3].=1      the first result describes the limiting distribution of the population proportions of mutant nucleotides at polymorphic sites at a single genetic locus in a large population . under the assumptions of section [ sec1 ] , this distribution is a poisson random field ( prf ) @xcite on @xmath14 , where each point is a population frequency ratio at a different site ( see theorem [ theo21 ] below ) . the second result ( theorem [ theo22 ] ) describes the expected number of polymorphic sites that have become fixed in the population at the mutant nucleotide since time 0 .",
    "this random variable is also poisson and is independent of the prf derived in theorem [ theo21 ] .",
    "silent and replacement polymorphic sites are modeled separately and provide different information ( see below ) .",
    "we begin with a model for the frequency of a mutant nucleotide at a single site in a finite population of haploid size @xmath3 .",
    "assume that mutation is sufficiently rare at the site level that repeat mutations at the same site can be neglected .",
    "we use moran s second model @xcite for which , at each step , an individual is randomly chosen from the population with equal probabilities and replaced by a copy of a second individual ( perhaps the same as the first ) chosen with probability proportional to the fitness .",
    "then the number @xmath15 of individuals in the population that have the mutant nucleotide at a particular site is a markov chain on @xmath16 with transition function @xmath17 for @xmath18 with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fitness of the mutant nucleotide @xmath5 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "a generation corresponds to @xmath3 time steps .",

    "the random variables @xmath47 are somewhat unintuitive in that each variable depends on information from many different polymorphic sites , rather than one , but turn out to have good statistical properties .",
    "we assume that the random variables @xmath24 and @xmath52 are independent and poisson distributed .",
    "then , by a slight extension of what is called bartlett s theorem  @xcite , this implies that , for each fixed @xmath53 , the counts @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are independent poisson and thus define a poisson random field ( prf ) on @xmath56 .",

    "an important difference between the two types of polymorphisms is that legacy polymorphisms can lead to shared polymorphisms , which are sites that are polymorphic in both samples .",
    "in contrast , if mutations are sufficiently rare so that they never occur more than once at the same site , then new polymorphisms can cause sample polymorphisms in only one daughter species .",
    "another difference is that legacy polymorphisms begin at mutant population frequencies strictly between 0 and 1 , while new polymorphisms begin at mutant population frequency 0 ( or @xmath137 for the markov chain ) .",
    "thus legacy polymorphisms are more likely to have multiple copies of both the mutant and original nucleotides for relatively recent divergence times .",
