    "during the last years quantum chaotic scattering was a field of intense research .",
    "a great deal of the results obtained was based on the projection operator formalism due to feshbach , weidenmller and others @xcite . in this approach",
    "the scattering system is decomposed into a closed subsystem described by the internal hamiltonian @xmath2 with discrete bound states @xmath3 and a continuum of external scattering states labeled by the energy @xmath4 and an index @xmath5 corresponding to different open scattering channels . the coupling between the internal and external subsystems is then incorporated by an operator with matrix elements @xmath6 .",
    "the s - matrix of the complete system can be expressed in terms of these matrix elements and the hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "this relation can be cast into the form @xmath7 @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are energy - dependent square matrices of dimension @xmath11 , and @xmath12 has dimension @xmath13 . while this setting is very general ,",
    "the tools developed for the subsequent analysis of the properties of the s - matrix require additional assumptions . in particular , the energy thresholds for the opening of new scattering channels are usually neglected . as a consequence",
    "the energy dependence of the coupling matrix @xmath14 can be considered weak and then the s - matrix ( [ sk ] ) can be rewritten in terms of an @xmath15 effective non hermitian hamiltonian @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 this canonical formalism @xcite for expressing the s - matrix is sometimes denoted as the heidelberg description of scattering , and we use this name to distinguish it from an s - matrix obtained directly , i.  e.without reference to any auxiliary closed system .    when the internal hamiltonian in ( [ seffh2 ] ) describes a chaotic system , it is justified to replace it by a random matrix @xcite , and by performing an average over the appropriate ensemble a statistical theory for the s - matrix is obtained which allows to calculate quantities of interest such as correlation functions or the distribution of wigner delay times and resonance poles @xcite .",
    "it was found that the results of such an approach are to a large extent independent of the detailed structure of the matrix @xmath12 , but they do depend on the dimensionless mean coupling strength @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the mean energy level spacing of the internal subsystem , and the average @xmath21 is taken over the internal states @xmath22 and all open scattering channels @xmath23 .",
    "for example , when the coupling constant ( [ coupling ] ) exceeds the critical value @xmath24 and the number of scattering channels is small compared to the total number of states , a counterintuitive shrinking of the widths of most resonances with increasing coupling is observed @xcite . for each attached scattering channel",
    "only one of the resonance widths grows further with the coupling @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting redistribution of s - matrix poles was coined resonance trapping .",
    "chaotic billiards with attached waveguides are considered as paradigm for chaotic scattering @xcite .",
    "they are relevant as theoretical models for understanding the transport properties of mesoscopic semiconductor structures @xcite or experimental results on microwave scattering in flat resonators @xcite .",
    "also signatures of resonance trapping were recently observed in billiards both , numerically @xcite and in microwave resonator experiments @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge there is no theory which maps a given billiard to an effective hamiltonian with overcritical coupling , thus really establishing a connection between the numerically and experimentally observed phenomena and the results on resonance trapping obtained within the formalism ( [ sk])-([coupling ] ) .    motivated by this situation , it is the purpose of the present paper to discuss the application of the heidelberg approach to open billiards in some detail and to answer questions such as : how can ( [ sk ] ) , ( [ seffh ] ) be derived for a billiard , what kind of approximations are involved and what is the resulting expression for the coupling constants @xmath6 ?",
    "what is the influence of the choice of the internal subsystem which is _ not unique _ for a given scattering system ?",
    "using the expression for the coupling constants @xmath26 to be derived in section ii we will then address the effective coupling constant for a typical chaotic billiard with an attached waveguide .",
    "we show in section iii that _ in the semiclassical regime _ , and when no tunneling barriers obstruct the waveguides , the coupling strength is fixed at the critical value @xmath24 , independently of the size or the precise geometry of the billiard and of its openings . a numerical verification of our results is contained in section iv , followed by a short discussion of the implications of our findings .",
    "we consider a situation as shown in fig .  [ sketch ] .",
    "a scattering system is formed in two dimensions by an infinite waveguide of width @xmath27 and and an arbitrary cavity . inside the system",
    "the potential is identically 0 .",
    "we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that the stationary schrdinger equation reduces to the helmholtz equation @xmath30 with @xmath31 . on the boundary of the scattering system ( bold solid line in fig",
    ".  [ sketch ] ) we require dirichlet b.  c. @xmath32 . this boundary condition and also the precise geometry of the system are by no means essential , the following generalizes e.  g.  immediately to a cavity with more than one attached lead or neumann b.  c. @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] we have shown several possibilities to define a closed billiard which corresponds to the scattering system in question ( solid and dotted thin lines ) .",
    "we will restrict the discussion to the case shown with a solid line : we require that the boundary of the internal system is located inside the attached waveguide and that it consists of a transversal straight line on which either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions are imposed to close the system .",
    "clearly , even this restriction makes the correspondence between the scattering system and the auxiliary internal system not unique because the exact position of the closure along the waveguide is variable .",
    "we use coordinates where this closure is at @xmath34 while the matching between waveguide and cavity is at @xmath35 @xmath36 .    in the region of the attached waveguide ( @xmath37 )",
    "we can decompose any function into transversal modes @xmath38 because these functions form a complete and orthonormal basis on the interval @xmath39 according to @xmath40 and @xmath41 the most general solution of the helmholtz equation is a superposition of the scattering states @xmath42 which consist of a single incoming wave in transversal mode @xmath23 and the corresponding outgoing modes given by the s - matrix of the system @xmath43 the longitudinal wave number @xmath44 is real for @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 $ ] denotes the integer part .",
    "these modes are called open or travelling , and the @xmath11 matrix @xmath47 corresponding to the open modes is the unitary s - matrix we are interested in .",
    "for @xmath48 the momentum along the waveguide is imaginary .",
    "these modes are called closed or evanescent . in the scattering state @xmath49 with @xmath50",
    "the evanescent outgoing modes describe exponentially decaying contributions which modify the wave function in the vicinity of the mouth of the waveguide .",
    "evanescent incoming modes are exponentially increasing into the waveguide and thus unphysical for the scattering system .",
    "when the evanescent modes are included , the s - matrix becomes an infinite - dimensional operator which is no longer unitary .",
    "it is possible to construct an eigenstate of the closed billiard by a superposition of the scattering states ( [ sstate ] ) including evanescent modes : suppose @xmath51 has an eigenvalue unity at some energy @xmath52 and let @xmath53 be the components of the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "then the linear combination of scattering states @xmath54 @xmath55 satisfies neumann b.  c. at @xmath34 and it is thus indeed an eigenfunction of the billiard because it satisfies ( [ helmholtz ] ) and the remaining boundary conditions by construction .",
    "the normalization of the s - matrix eigenvector @xmath53 in ( [ billefn ] ) is _ not _ unity but rather determined by the normalization of the billiard eigenfunction @xmath56 .",
    "if dirichlet boundary conditions are required at @xmath34 the same argument can be repeated for an eigenvalue @xmath57 of the s - matrix and we have @xmath58 @xmath55 .",
    "consequently the spectrum of the billiard closed with neumann or dirichlet b.  c.  can be found from the secular equation @xmath59 which was first derived by doron and smilansky @xcite . in a sense we will in the following invert",
    "this so - called scattering approach to the quantization of billiards : we will express the s - matrix in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the closed system .",
    "for this purpose consider the green function of the closed billiard which is defined as the resolvent of @xmath60 in the space of functions which satisfy the boundary conditions of the billiard . in position representation",
    "this definition can be expressed by the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath61 in the eigenbasis of the billiard the green function reads @xmath62 which can be verified using @xmath63 and the completeness of the functions @xmath64 inside the billiard .",
    "for @xmath65 and @xmath66 inside the waveguide we can expand the green function with respect to the transversal modes @xmath67 and find as the general form of a solution of ( [ ihhelmholtz ] ) @xmath68\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indeed , the first term inside the brackets gives rise to one particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ ihhelmholtz ] ) , while the second term with the unknown matrices @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 represents the most general solution of the corresponding homogeneous helmholtz equation ( [ helmholtz ] ) .",
    "the unknown coefficients must be determined such that the green function satisfies also the boundary conditions inside the cavity and on the transversal closure of the waveguide . for this purpose",
    "assume first @xmath73 and consider @xmath65 as a fixed parameter .",
    "then @xmath74 as a function of @xmath66 should satisfy the homogeneous helmholtz equation with the boundary conditions of the scattering system , i.  e.  it can be written as a superposition of the scattering states @xmath75 defined in eq .",
    "( [ sstate ] ) . on the other hand , when @xmath66 is fixed , the green function as a function of @xmath65 satisfies the boundary conditions ( neumann or dirichlet ) at @xmath34 where the closed billiard is separated from the waveguide by the additional straight wall .",
    "thus , it must be a superposition of the functions @xmath76 which are in fact the scattering states for a semi - infinite waveguide with neumann or dirichlet b.c . at one end .",
    "consequently , the green function has the form @xmath77 with another set of undetermined coefficients @xmath78 . expanding ( [ gfdeco2 ] ) into transversal modes and comparing to ( [ gfdeco1 ] ) we obtain @xmath79 we can now repeat this argumentation under the opposite assumption @xmath80 and find again the relations ( [ relations ] ) but with @xmath70 and @xmath71 exchanged",
    "this can be regarded as a consequence of the symmetry of the green function with respect to its two arguments which in turn follows from time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we conclude @xmath81 and hence @xmath82 note that @xmath83 and thus the green function diverges as expected at the solutions of the secular equation ( [ seceq ] ) , i.  e. , when @xmath84 corresponds to an eigenvalue of the closed billiard .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) we can now directly relate the s - matrix to the transversal expansion coefficients of the green function at the closure of the billiard .",
    "we define for @xmath85 inside the waveguide @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88 and derive from ( [ gfdeco2 ] ) using ( [ gs ] ) @xmath89 @xmath90 obviously , @xmath91 for dirichlet b.  c.  and @xmath92 for neumann b.  c.  at @xmath34 .",
    "( [ ksn ] ) , ( [ ksd ] ) can be inverted and yield @xmath93 which is now in the form of ( [ sk ] ) ( for neumann b.  c.  up to an irrelevant constant phase ) . we can now proceed to determine the corresponding coupling constants @xmath94 by representing the k - matrix in the eigenbasis of the billiard . from ( [ sk2 ] )",
    "we have @xmath95 and from ( [ gfdeco ] ) , ( [ kn ] ) , ( [ kd ] ) we find @xmath96 @xmath97 where we have introduced the projections @xmath98 of the eigenfunctions of the closed billiard onto the transversal modes of the waveguide .",
    "the values of the coupling constants follow from comparing ( [ kw ] ) to ( [ kpsin ] ) and ( [ kpsid ] ) @xmath99 @xmath100 this form of the dependence of the coupling constants on the internal wave functions is not surprising : also within perturbation theory the coupling depends on the value of the wave function at the point where the system is opened or on its normal derivative for neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "however , in the situation we consider perturbation theory is not applicable and , in particular , the precise value of the prefactor in the coupling constants ( [ wn ] ) , ( [ wd ] ) could only be obtained from the derivation given in this section .",
    "the representation ( [ sknd ] ) of the s - matrix in terms of the k - matrices ( [ kpsin ] ) , ( [ kpsid ] ) is exact , when all transversal modes are included .",
    "however , usually one is interested only in the @xmath11 unitary part of the s - matrix , and this is only _ approximately _ given by ( [ sknd ] ) when the k - matrix is restricted to open modes . in @xcite the effect of this so - called semiquantal approximation for the accuracy of eigenvalues within the scattering approach to quantization was investigated numerically .",
    "it becomes negligible when the energy @xmath4 is sufficiently far from the threshold for the opening of a new channel . under this restriction",
    "we can consider @xmath94 as the coupling constants corresponding to the unitary part of the s - matrix .",
    "when @xmath4 approaches a threshold , eq .",
    "( [ seffh ] ) breaks down , since the energy - dependence of the coupling constants can no longer be neglected .",
    "we will not consider this case here .",
    "given the explicit values ( [ wn ] ) , ( [ wd ] ) for the coupling constants between individual states and individual scattering channels we are now going to derive an estimate for the dimensionless coupling strength ( [ coupling ] ) in the semiclassical limit and neglecting evanescent modes .",
    "since the concept of a mean coupling strength is not well - defined for infinitely many internal states , the internal hamiltonian @xmath2 entering ( [ sk2 ] ) , ( [ seffh2 ] ) should for this purpose be cut to some finite matrix including only states which are close enough in energy @xmath101 .",
    "in particular this means that we can replace the momenta along the waveguide @xmath102 in ( [ billefn ] ) , ( [ billefd ] ) by their on - shell values @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting approximate expansions of the billiard eigenfunctions are projected onto the transversal modes according to ( [ billefpr ] ) and inserted into ( [ wn ] ) , ( [ wd ] ) which simplify to @xmath104 at this point it is necessary to determine the average magnitude of the coefficients @xmath105 .",
    "we assume that the classical dynamics of the billiard is chaotic . in the semiclassical limit",
    "this means that the quantum ergodicity theorem applies to the eigenstates of the billiard , i.  e.  in particular the probability density integrated over an arbitrary region of the billiard tends to the relative area of that region .",
    "applied to the part of the billiard inside the waveguide we find @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the total area of billiard . in the second line",
    "we have inserted the normal mode decomposition into @xmath108 .",
    "the orthonormalization of the transversal modes was then used to restrict the resulting double sum over modes to diagonal terms . in the third line @xmath109",
    "was used ( @xmath110 in the completely analogous calculation for dirichlet b.c . ) , and the sum over modes was approximated by a continuous integral .",
    "this is justified when the number of modes is large , i.  e.  in the semiclassical limit . using the resulting constraint on the normalization of the coefficients of the billiard eigenfunctions in the transversal basis implied by ( [ normalization ] ) , @xmath111",
    ", we find @xmath112 according to ( [ coupling ] ) the average coupling between the internal states and the continuum must be normalized by the mean level spacing @xmath20 of the billiard which is the only independent energy scale of the system . to leading semiclassical order we have weyl s law @xmath113 @xcite which finally results in @xmath114",
    "to check the validity of the heidelberg approach for a quantum billiard we have performed direct numerical calculations for a sinai billiard connected to a single waveguide ( see fig .  [ geom ] ) .",
    "first , we evaluated numerically the @xmath115 lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the closed system with dirichlet and neumann b.c .  at the boundary segment",
    "to which the waveguide was attached . using the expressions ( [ billefpr])-([wd ] ) we calculated the elements of the coupling matrix @xmath116 .",
    "the first observation is that the distribution of the numerically obtained values of @xmath116 is fairly close to a poisson distribution , that is expected for a fully random coupling .",
    "hence the elements of the coupling matrix @xmath12 evaluated with help of the formulae ( [ billefpr])-([wd ] ) resemble the random coupling standardly used in the heidelberg approach .",
    "knowing @xmath12 and using eqs .",
    "( [ sk ] ) , ( [ sk2 ] ) we evaluated  as the next step ",
    "the @xmath9-matrix and compared it to the @xmath9-matrix obtained by a direct method based on the numerical solution of the underlying schrdinger equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in order to visualize the differences between these two @xmath9-matrices we compared first the corresponding wigner - smith time delays @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the number of the open channels inside the waveguide .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ td_low ] .",
    "the figure shows an outstanding agreement of the two approaches for low energies .",
    "the heidelberg approach describes the positions as well as the widths of the narrow resonances with high accuracy .",
    "the agreement is good even close to the threshold energies of the individual channels . for higher energies ,",
    "however , the difference between the two time delay functions increases due to the limited number of internal states included into the evaluation of the heidelberg @xmath9-matrix .",
    "similar results ( not displayed ) were obtained also with the waveguide attached to the boundaries no .",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively . in all these cases",
    "the neumann matching procedure was used .    on the other hand , for dirichlet matching ( eq .",
    "[ wd ] ) the results change drastically . in this case",
    "the agreement is not good even for low energies .",
    "this may seem surprising because the derivations of the previous sections were entirely parallel for neumann and dirichlet b.  c. however , an important difference is hidden in the convergence properties of the spectral decompositions of the k - matrix ( [ kpsin ] ) , ( [ kpsid ] ) as we shall explain now . projecting ( [ billefn ] ) , ( [ billefd ] ) onto transversal mode @xmath23 we find @xmath122 since the coefficients @xmath105 are according to ( [ normalization ] ) of order @xmath123 which is independent of @xmath22 , we have from ( [ wn ] ) , ( [ wd ] ) @xmath124 for a 2d billiard @xmath125 @xmath126 such that the terms in the infinite spectral sum ( [ kw ] ) decay asymptotically as @xmath127 for neumann and as @xmath128 for dirichlet b.c .",
    "hence the convergence is absolute for neumann b.c . while ( [ kpsid ] ) converges only conditionally . as a consequence , the numerically necessary cut - off in the summation over the internal states @xmath22 introduces large errors for dirichlet b.c .",
    "for the following considerations we will concentrate on neumann b.c .",
    "as already mentioned , the choice of the internal and external part of the system is not unique , since an arbitrary part of the ideal waveguide can be considered part of the internal system . increasing",
    "the length of the waveguide included , we decrease in fact the influence of the evanescent modes since they are exponentially vanishing inside waveguide .",
    "we have checked this relation and evaluated the time delay functions also for various waveguide parts included into the internal system .",
    "the results remain practically unchanged regardless on the length of the included part .",
    "this demonstrates the small influence of the evanescent modes on the resulting heidelberg @xmath9-matrix .    knowing the coupling matrix @xmath12 and using the relation eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) we evaluated numerically the value of the coupling constant @xmath25 .",
    "the obtained result is in an excellent agreement with the estimated value ( [ g1 ] ) for all considered types of the waveguide attachment leading to @xmath129 .",
    "we have evaluated the coupling constant @xmath25 also for a different shape of the billiard @xcite obtaining similar values for @xmath25 .",
    "it has to be stressed that the estimate ( [ g1 ] ) was obtained using semiclassical arguments .",
    "our calculation shows , however , that it remains valid even in the deep quantum region .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath16 ( eq .  [ seffh2 ] ) are usually interpreted as the resonance poles and are used for the study of the statistical properties of resonances in open quantum chaotic systems @xcite . to check the validity of this approach",
    "we have evaluated the resonance poles of the system independently using the complex scaling method @xcite that provides a direct access to the positions of the poles of the analytically continued @xmath9-matrix .",
    "the obtained results were compared with the eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian ( [ seffh2 ] ) .",
    "however , a direct comparison is obscured by the fact that the coupling matrix @xmath12 is in fact energy dependent . in the standard random matrix approach",
    "the coupling matrix is treated as being energy independent  a simplification that is well justified inside a small energy interval .",
    "to mimic this situation and to minimize the influence of the energy dependence of the coupling matrix @xmath12 we have compared the eigenvalues of @xmath16 with the directly evaluated resonance poles always within a small energy interval the center of which was equal to the energy used to evaluate the coupling matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath12 can be taken into account more precisely using the relation ( [ sk ] ) and evaluating the heidelberg resonance poles as zeros of the function @xmath130 .",
    "we have evaluated the heidelberg resonance poles using both of the above described approaches and compared the results to the resonances obtained by complex scaling . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ poles ] . from this figure",
    "we see that for narrow resonances the eigenvalues of effective hamiltonian @xmath16 represent a good approximation to the resonance poles of the system and the energy dependence of the coupling matrix @xmath12 can be omitted . for broad resonances",
    "the situation changes and the complex eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian have nothing in common with the directly evaluated resonance poles .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained as follows : a resonance localized at @xmath131 represents in fact a collective mode of all bound states @xmath132 of the internal hamiltonian @xmath133 that are located inside the energy interval @xmath134 . for a broad resonance with @xmath135",
    "significantly larger then the mean spacing between the bound states @xmath132 the number of the internal states to be included into @xmath16 must be very high .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the heidelberg approach to scattering , which is the basis of many important random - matrix results on quantum chaotic scattering , leads to reasonably good agreement when compared with the results of a direct calculation of the s - matrix in the case of billiards with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we have explained the somewhat unexpected finding that the accuracy is much worse for dirichlet boundary conditions , while it does not depend very much on other possibilities of varying the auxiliary closed system used , such as the position of the attached waveguide .",
    "even for neumann boundary conditions the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 based on the heidelberg approach seems to be not very well suited for the computation of broad resonances of the system .",
    "this result does not contradict the fact , that also for systems with time - reversal symmetry the _ statistical _ properties of billiard resonances follow the predictions of random - matrix theory based upon the effective hamiltonian approach quite well @xcite , because our test goes way beyond a purely statistical analysis .",
    "moreover , we have shown numerically and with semiclassical arguments that the mean dimensionless coupling for a chaotic billiard is the critical value @xmath24irrespective of the precise form of the billiard , the size of the attached waveguide and other details of the model .",
    "interestingly , in our model an effective coupling near @xmath24 is observed already deep in the quantum regime .",
    "nevertheless , fluctuations around the mean value @xmath24 should in general be largest for small energies and can possibly result locally in overcritical coupling .",
    "this might be an explanation for the observed resonance trapping in billiards @xcite .",
    "our results concerning the value of the effective coupling for chaotic systems are not restricted to billiards and apply , e.  g. , to quantum graphs as well . in these systems , a systematic way to achieve overcritical coupling for many states is to modulate the density of states , e.  g.  by considering systems with band spectra @xcite ."
