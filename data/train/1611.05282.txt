    "<S> the explicit expressions for @xmath85 can be computed as a function of the model parameters @xmath86 , using the methods described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite supplementary material @xcite .    to compare the mean - field model with the numerical data of the particle - based model </S>",
    "<S> , we have to fit the values of the model parameters @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> we used the following fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> first , the elastic modulus @xmath51 is estimated independently from the initial elastic response in the stress - strain curve ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ) yielding @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the parameters @xmath88 are fitted on the flow curve obtained in the absence of activity ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , in turn yielding @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> having fixed the four parameters @xmath94 , we then fit the different flow curves obtained in the active case ( @xmath95 ) with @xmath25 as the only free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure eventually yields the fitted value @xmath96 , which is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) . as expected , the fitted value of @xmath97 is larger than @xmath98 , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] , and that the coupling @xmath68 is smaller than @xmath99 as required to observe a herschel - bulkley behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we further observe that the obtained value of @xmath100 is larger than for the lennard - jones systems @xcite ; we attribute this larger value to the presence of a softer potential .     as a function of the apoptosis rate @xmath11 for different small values of the shear rate ( symbols for the numerical data and dash - dotted lines for mean - field prediction ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the stress diffusion coefficient @xmath101 fitted from the mean - field prediction is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](a ) , and scales fairly linearly with  @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as follows . at low @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> apoptosis events are rare and independent , so we can safely assume that the typical redistributed stress @xmath102 after such events will depend only on the packing fraction but not on the activity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at low shear rates the only relevant timescale is set by the apoptosis rate . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can estimate the stress diffusion coefficient @xmath25 by simple scaling argument as @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the mean - field picture predicts a crossover @xmath104 linear with @xmath25 , and hence we expect @xmath105 , consistently with the flow curve crossover shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) .    to provide further insights on the behavior of our model , </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] the activity - dependent viscosity @xmath106 for different fixed , low values of the shear rate . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the viscosity decreases when activity is enhanced beyond a ( strain - rate - dependent ) threshold value , i.e.  fluidizing the system as previously reported in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the maxwell picture proposed in  @xcite can not capture the crossover to the non - linear rheology that we observe in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the plateau in the viscosity observed at low activity [ see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ] </S>",
    "<S> does not correspond to a newtonian regime ( in which the shear stress varies linearly with @xmath23 ) , but rather to a yield stress fluid behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen from the fact that the plateau value of the viscosity strongly depends on the strain rate @xmath23 , a property that can not be accounted for by a simple maxwell model . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented in fig .  [ fig:4 ] can be understood as follows . at low enough activity , plasticity is dominant and the shear stress remains independent of activity . for a fixed shear rate , </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity @xmath106 is thus independent of activity , yielding the plateau in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] . at higher activity , </S>",
    "<S> the active contribution to the mechanical noise instead becomes dominant , thus decreasing the viscosity . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field model predicts @xmath107 ( see supplementary material @xcite ) , in good agreement with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] ( dashed - dot lines ) , taking into account @xmath108 . note here again the good agreement between the mean - field model and the numerical simulations .    in conclusion , we proposed in this letter a generic scenario to understand the crossover from linear to non - linear rheology in flowing active tissues , based on stress fluctuations mediated by long - range elastic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field picture presented here allows us to introduce explicitly the interplay of the two relevant timescales in these systems , one imposed by the external shear and another by the internal processes of the biological tissue in form of cell division and apoptosis . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is able to rationalize well the numerical findings of our particle - based model for the active confluent tissue under shear , as can be seen from the flow curves and the activity - dependent viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that our mean - field predictions are qualitatively robust to the addition of disorder @xcite , partial relaxation of stress or effective shear - rate dependence of the elastic modulus or relaxation time @xcite , assessing furthermore the generality of our scenario . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the introduction of additional relaxation mechanisms like cell - shape fluctuations , self propulsion , external vibrations and other sources of mechanical noise , can be easily implemented in our mean - field description via assumptions on the distribution of the active part of the noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , to allow for a more refined description of the dynamics aiming for a quantitative agreement , it would be interesting to investigate in more details the long - range elastic effects of cell division and apoptosis events . </S>",
    "<S> a strong point of our approach is that it can be easily generalized to describe the rheological response of other systems that include an additional shear - rate independent noise , such as vibrated grains @xcite , active colloidal suspensions @xcite or coarsening foams @xcite .    </S>",
