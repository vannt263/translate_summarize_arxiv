    "observations strongly favor a universe that has recently entered a phase of accelerated expansion  @xcite .",
    "this poses a puzzle for modern cosmology as standard _ general relativity _ ( gr ) , applied to a universe which contains only radiation and dust , has difficulties fitting the data .",
    "one can view this as evidence for the existence of _ dark energy _ ( de )  a yet unknown component with a negative equation of state , such as a cosmological constant , @xmath0 .",
    "an alternative explanation could involve modifying gr in a manner that leads to accelerating solutions .",
    "popular examples include the so - called @xmath1 class of models  @xcite , chameleon type scalar - tensor theories  @xcite , the _ dvali - gabadadze - porrati _",
    "( dgp ) model  @xcite , and models motivated by dgp , such as the recently introduced degravitation scenario  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0cdm model , consisting of gr with @xmath0 and _ cold dark matter _ ( cdm ) , is currently the best fit to the data , it faces some challenges on the theoretical side , such as the coincidence and the fine - tuning problems . on the other side ,",
    "alternative theories of gravity have to satisfy the multitude of existing experimental tests passed by gr  @xcite .",
    "this typically requires a degree of fine - tuning which , at best , does not improve on that involved in setting @xmath0 to the value required by current data .",
    "moreover , once these modified theories are tuned to avoid conflicts with existing constraints ( when it is possible ) , their predictions for the expansion history of the universe are often identical to that of the @xmath0cdm model@xcite .",
    "however , this degeneracy is typically broken at the level of cosmological structure formation ; indeed , models of modified gravity that closely mimic the cosmological constant at the background level can still give significantly different predictions of the growth of structure .",
    "the large scale structure of the universe therefore offers a promising testing ground for gr and it is important to explore to what extent one can detect departures from gr in the growth of structure with present and upcoming cosmological data .    by definition ,",
    "the term ` modified gravity ' implies that the form of the einstein - hilbert action is different from that of gr , and , as a consequence , the einstein equations are changed . at the background level ,",
    "the modifications allow for a late - time acceleration , which is typically degenerate with @xmath0cdm after the required tuning .",
    "however , since the equations describing the evolution of cosmological perturbations are modified as well , models with the same expansion history as in @xmath0cdm can lead to different dynamics for the growth of cosmic structure .",
    "structure formation has been studied for f(r ) models in  @xcite , for chameleon models in  @xcite , and for the dgp model in  @xcite .",
    "one way to test the consistency of the @xmath0cdm model is to compare values of the cosmological parameters extracted from distance measures , such as supernovae magnitudes and baryon acoustic oscillations , to the values found from growth measures , such as galaxy counts and weak lensing @xcite .",
    "one can also introduce general parametrizations of the modified evolution of gravitational potentials and matter perturbations   @xcite for the purpose of detecting / constraining departures from gr .",
    "scalar metric perturbations in the newtonian gauge are described by two potentials , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which correspond to perturbations in the time - time and space - space components of the metric tensor , respectively . in the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "these two potentials are equal during the epoch of structure formation , and their time dependence is set by the same scale - independent linear growth function @xmath4 that describes the growth of matter density perturbations .",
    "this , generally , is no longer true in theories of modified gravity , where one can have scale - dependent growth patterns .",
    "the two newtonian potentials need not be the same , and their dependence on matter perturbations can be different . working in fourier space , we parametrize the ratio between the newtonian potentials and the dependence of @xmath5 on the matter density perturbation with two time- and scale - dependent functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we then study the potential of upcoming and future tomographic surveys to constrain departures of these functions from their gr values .",
    "dealing with unknown functions implies working with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly to the more widely studied problem of determining the dark energy equation of state , @xmath8 , one can proceed in several ways :    1 .",
    "one can assume a functional form motivated by a certain class of theories , with a few parameters , and forecast the constraints on the parameters .",
    "this would tell us the extent to which one can constrain these theories and also allow us to reconstruct the shape of the functions based on the chosen form .",
    "the results , of course , would depend on the choice of the parametrization .",
    "however , they would be good indicators of the power of current and upcoming surveys to constrain departures from gr .",
    "moreover , as we will discuss shortly , it is possible to employ a parametrization that accurately represents a broad class of modified theories .",
    "this is the approach we take in this paper .",
    "2 .   another , non - parametric approach , consists of performing a _ principal component analysis _ ( pca ) to determine the eigenmodes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 that can be constrained by data  @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to compare different experiments and their combinations according to the relative gain in information about the functions .",
    "pca can also point to the `` sweet spots '' in redshift and scale where data is most sensitive to variations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which can be a useful guide for designing future observing strategies .",
    "the pca method does not allow one to reconstruct the shape of the functions from data .",
    "however , one can still reproduce the errors on parameters of any parametrization from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues found using pca  @xcite .",
    "hence , in terms of forecasting the errors , the pca method can do everything that the first method can , plus the benefits mentioned above .",
    "it is , however , more demanding computationally , and one needs a criterion for deciding which modes are well - constrained .",
    "we consider the pca method in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "3 .   a third approach , which can work for certain estimators of @xmath10 , is a direct reconstruction from data . in  @xcite",
    ", it was proposed to consider the ratio of the peculiar velocity - galaxy correlation with the weak lensing - galaxy correlation .",
    "in such a ratio , the dependence on the galaxy bias cancels out .",
    "then , since the peculiar velocities are determined by the potential @xmath5 , while the weak lensing is controlled by @xmath11 , such ratio , if appropriately constructed , would directly probe any difference between @xmath12 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is a more direct and model - independent way of testing gr with the growth of structure than the first two methods .",
    "its power , however , will depend on how well future experiments will be able to measure peculiar velocities .",
    "also , while it may allow the extraction of @xmath10 , it does not directly probe @xmath9 .",
    "still , this is a novel and promising method that should be pursued in parallel with the first two .",
    "our parametric forms for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are analogous to those introduced in  @xcite , and contain a total of five parameters .",
    "these forms are highly accurate in describing the linear growth in a wide class of scalar - tensor theories and also flexible enough to capture features of modified dynamics in other theories .",
    "we use the fisher matrix technique to forecast the errors on the modified growth parameters , along with the standard set of cosmological parameters .",
    "we represent the data in terms of a set of all possible two - point correlation functions ( both auto- and cross - correlations ) between the galaxy counts , weak lensing shear , and _ cosmic microwave background _ ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy , across multiple redshift bins , in addition to the cmb e - mode polarization autocorrelation , and the cmb e - mode and temperature cross - correlation .",
    "we find that even with a conservative treatment of data , such as using only the modes that are well within the linear regime , the upcoming and future tomographic surveys , like the _ dark energy survey _ ( des ) and _ large synoptic survey telescope _",
    "( lsst ) , in combination with cmb and future _ supernovae _ ( sne ) luminosity - distance data , will be able to produce non - trivial constraints on all five parameters .",
    "we also show that lsst will significantly improve our ability to test gr , compared to des .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "we study the evolution of linear matter and metric perturbations in a general metric theory of gravity . assuming that the background evolution is correctly described by the flat _ friedmann - robertson - walker _ ( frw ) metric , we focus on scalar perturbations and work in the conformal newtonian gauge , so that the perturbed line element is given by [ metric ] ds^2=-a^2()[(1 + 2(,))d^2-(1 - 2(,))d^2 ]  , where @xmath13 is the conformal time . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "all the perturbed quantities are presented in fourier space , dots indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( as opposed to @xmath15 , which contains a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "we use the standard notation for the energy momentum tensor of the matter fields , which to first order in the perturbations , assumes the following form [ en - mom_tensor ] & & t^0_0=-(1 + ) , + & & t^0_i=-(+p)v_i , + & & t^i_j=(p+p)^i_j+^i_j , where @xmath18 is the density contrast , @xmath19 the velocity field , @xmath20 the pressure perturbation and @xmath21 denotes the traceless component of the energy - momentum tensor . finally , we define the anisotropic stress @xmath22 via @xmath23 .    in gr ,",
    "the linearized einstein equations provide two independent equations relating the metric potentials and matter perturbations , the poisson and anisotropy equations , respectively : [ poisson ] & & k^2=-  , + [ anisotropy ] & & k^2(-)=(+p ) , where @xmath24 is the comoving density perturbation . in the @xmath0cdm and minimally coupled quintessence models , the anisotropic stress is negligible at times relevant for structure formation , and we have @xmath25 .    in models of modified gravity , as well as in more exotic models of dark energy ,",
    "the relation between the two newtonian potentials , and between the potentials and matter perturbations , can be different  @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the changes to the poisson and the anisotropy equations as follows : [ parametrization - poisson ] & & k^2=-(a , k ) + [ parametrization - anisotropy ] & & = ( a , k )  , where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are two time- and scale - dependent functions encoding the modifications of gravity and/or the contribution of an exotic dark energy fluid .",
    "note that we have chosen to define @xmath9 via the poisson equation ( [ parametrization - poisson ] ) written in terms of @xmath5 , the perturbation to the time - time component of the metric .",
    "this choice is natural , as it is @xmath5 that enters the evolution equation for cdm density perturbations on sub - horizon scales corresponds to @xmath26 in the notation of  @xcite  their @xmath12 is our @xmath5 , and _",

    "the gravitational potentials are not going to be observed directly . in order to see the effect of the modifications on observable quantities , such as _ galaxy counts _ ( gc ) ,",
    "_ weak lensing _ shear ( wl ) and cmb , we modify the publicly available _ code for anisotropies in the microwave background _ ( camb )",
    "this requires implementing eqs .",
    "( [ parametrization - poisson ] ) and ( [ parametrization - anisotropy ] ) in the synchronous gauge used in camb .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in appendix  [ camb_implementation ] , where we also demonstrate that our method respects the super - horizon consistency condition  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the effects of modified gravity , the evolution of all cosmological perturbations depends on the background expansion .",
    "we restrict ourselves to background histories consistent with the flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "one reason for this choice is that @xmath0cdm is currently the best fit to available data .",
    "another reason comes from the fact that in the recently popular models of modified gravity , e.g. the scalar - tensor models , @xmath1 , ndgp and degravitation ( but not sdgp ) , the expansion history is effectively the same as in @xmath0cdm , and the main differences between models arise from the evolution of cosmic structure . finally , by restricting ourselves to @xmath0cdm - like expansion histories",
    ", we can better distinguish the effects of modified growth .",
    "we do not , however , fix the values of the cosmological parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , nor the spectral index @xmath30 or the optical depth @xmath31 .",
    "these cosmological parameters will be varied along with the modified growth parameters . in principle",
    ", it would be interesting to also allow for a non - zero spatial curvature and for variations in the effective dark energy equation of state .",
    "we have included these effects in our forecasts for @xmath7 and @xmath6 based on the pca approach  @xcite .",
    "to arrive at a suitable parametrization of the functions @xmath7 and @xmath6 , we note that models of modified gravity typically introduce a transition scale which separates regimes where gravity behaves differently .",
    "for example , in @xmath1 and scalar - tensor models , the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are equal to unity at early times and on large scales ( @xmath32 on scales that are larger than the characteristic scale of the model ) , and they transition to a modified value on smaller scales and late times .",
    "we can mimic this time- and scale - dependent transition via the following functions of the variable @xmath33 [ par_g ] & & ( a , k)= + [ par_gamma ] & & ( a , k)=  , where the parameters @xmath34 have dimensions of length squared , while the @xmath35 represent dimensionless couplings .",
    "the expressions  ( [ par_g ] ) and  ( [ par_gamma ] ) coincide with the scale - dependent parametrization introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that this parametrization follows from scalar - tensor theories , of which the @xmath1 models are an example . in these models ,",
    "one makes a distinction between the so - called jordan frame , with the metric @xmath36 , ( where matter falls along the geodesics and the action for gravity is modified ) , and the einstein frame , with the metric @xmath37 , in which the einstein form of the action is preserved but there is an additional scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity  @xcite . in what follows",

    "the behavior of cosmological perturbations in general models of coupled dark energy has been studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the scalar field does not contribute any anisotropic stress , neither do matter fields , so the newtonian potentials in the einstein frame are equal : @xmath43 .",

    "<S> in alternative theories of gravity , designed to produce cosmic acceleration at the current epoch , the growth of large scale structure can be modified . </S>",
    "<S> we study the potential of upcoming and future tomographic surveys such as des and lsst , with the aid of cmb and supernovae data , to detect departures from the growth of cosmic structure expected within general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> we employ parametric forms to quantify the potential time- and scale - dependent variation of the effective gravitational constant , and the differences between the two newtonian potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the fisher matrix technique to forecast the errors on the modified growth parameters from galaxy clustering , weak lensing , cmb , and their cross - correlations across multiple photometric redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even with conservative assumptions about the data , des will produce non - trivial constraints on modified growth , and that lsst will do significantly better . </S>"
