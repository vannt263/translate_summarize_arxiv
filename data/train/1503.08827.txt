    "the majority of o stars are found in young star clusters or ob associations .",
    "it has been suggested that a small fraction of massive stars may form in isolation as a result of stochastic sampling of the stellar and cluster mass function ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the case of the galactic field o stars within 23  kpc from the sun , essentially all of them can be traced back to young star clusters or associations @xcite , suggesting the field o stars also formed in clusters @xcite .",
    "some observational studies on o stars in the large and small magellanic clouds have claimed there to be evidence for isolated massive star formation @xcite , such as e.g. , apparent isolation , absence of a bow - shock , and circular shape of an region .",
    "these claims can not , however , be conclusive since they can be explained with slowly moving runaways or former members of clusters which have already dissolved @xcite . for example , only 3040 per cent of the galactic ob runaways are found to have a bow - shock @xcite , and , furthermore , bow - shock formation depends on the physical condition of the ambient medium through which a runaway travels ( e.g. , temperature and density of the ambient medium , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that runaways can have a circular region in the projected h@xmath6 emission . furthermore , in the case of the 30  dor region bressert et al .",
    "considered , there are many young star clusters in the region .",
    "if the 30  dor region is modelled by a population of clusters , how many o stars would be ejected or removed from their clusters in 10 myr ?",
    "this has not been investigated .",
    "any conclusion on the issue of isolated o - star formation are , for the time being , thus premature .",
    "finally , measuring stellar proper motions in the large or small magellanic clouds is unfeasible such that claims for o stars formed in isolation become next to impossible to confirm or reject . with , however , it may become possible to put constraints on this if proper motions of massive stars can be measured to a precision of a few @xmath7 in the magellanic clouds .",
    "given the above results on the well studied ensemble of o stars within 23  kpc around the sun it appears physically more plausible that all o stars form in embedded clusters .",
    "there are two mechanisms to expel o stars from a star cluster .",
    "the one is the binary supernova scenario @xcite in which a star in a binary obtains a high velocity after the supernova explosion of the initially more massive companion star .",
    "the other is dynamical ejection through strong close encounters with other massive stars in the cluster core @xcite . of the candidate",
    "isolated o stars catalogued by @xcite , @xmath8@xmath9 per cent could not be traced back to any still existing star clusters or associations , but are consistent with originating in a cluster which could not be found due to several effects such as incompleteness of their cluster sample @xcite , dissolution of the cluster @xcite , and having experienced the two - step - ejection process proposed by @xcite .",
    "the majority of the stars which can be traced back to clusters appear to have been ejected when their parental clusters were very young @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that dynamical ejections through few - body interactions in the heavy - star - rich cluster core mainly populate the field o star population @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies on dynamically ejected massive stars from young star clusters using numerical integrations . in most cases the studies performed few - body scattering experiments focused on runaways , which are ejected with a velocity higher than @xmath43040  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "full @xmath1-body  calculations for a particular cluster mass have also been presented @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath1-body  calculations for very dense star clusters composed of single stars with three different cluster masses ( @xmath10 ) and showed that the clusters with the lowest mass in their models , @xmath11 , produce runaways most efficiently .",
    "they argued that the one bullying binary formed during core collapse of the cluster is responsible for the production of runaways and that the number of runaways is almost independent of cluster mass . the runaway fraction ( number of runaway stars over total number of stars still present )",
    "therefore decreases with cluster mass as the more massive clusters have more stars .",
    "note that the lower - mass limit for stars in their models is @xmath12 .",
    "thus , if a cluster is populated with a full range of stellar masses from the hydrogen burning limit upwards , in order to have the same amount of massive stars , the cluster would be twice as massive than they claimed .",
    "the relation between o star ejection fraction and cluster mass has not been studied in detail to date .    here",
    "we study for the first time how the dynamical ejection fraction of o stars changes with the masses of very young star clusters using direct @xmath1-body  calculations with a broad range of cluster masses , from low - mass clusters containing one or two o stars to massive clusters containing a few hundred o stars , and including primordial binaries .",
    "such an investigation based on a very large library of young cluster models has not been possible to date because the knowledge on the properties of initial stellar population , their birth configurations and last but not least the computational algorithms enabling such a cpu - intensive and massive numerical challenge have not been in place .",
    "thus , for example , how to initialize initially a mass segregated cluster in dynamical equilibrium is only known since the work of @xcite and @xcite and the statistical distribution functions of massive star binaries are becoming observationally constrained only now ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is motivated by the angular momentum problem of star formation since the angular momentum of a collapsing cloud core can be distributed efficiently into two stars , and also by the strong empirical evidence that star formation universally prefers the binary mode @xcite . the @xcite period distribution function with minimum and maximum periods of 10 and @xmath25  days , respectively , is adopted for all binaries in the library .",

    "here we include two more model sequences with different half - mass radii of 0.1 and 0.8 pc , ms1op and ms8op , respectively .",

    "_ such a short distance criterion for ejections is an appropriate physical condition to quantify the real ejected o star fraction , in order to account for the o stars which have been dynamically ejected but have not travelled far from the cluster centre by 3  myr .",
    "o stars can be ejected with a velocity of a few @xmath7 from the lower - mass clusters , e.g. , the central escape velocity of a cluster with @xmath66 and @xmath58  pc is @xmath67 .    from the computational data the ejection fraction of o star systems , @xmath68 ,",

    "table  [ tabresult ] lists averaged properties of the models , such as half - mass radius , number of o star systems , number of ejected o star systems , o star ejection fraction , and o star binary fraction in the clusters and among the ejected o star systems , at 3  myr .",
    "all models show a trend that @xmath73 increases with a cluster mass up to @xmath2 and then decreases for a higher cluster mass .",
    "the average values of the ejection fraction with the same cluster mass vary from model to model .",
    "the peak fractions are @xmath74 per cent for the binary - rich cluster models with @xmath58  pc with a weak dependency on initial mass segregation or on the initial period distribution of massive binaries , although the @xmath73 values of the other cluster masses change with the initial conditions .",
    "_ note that individual clusters in the mass range @xmath75 to @xmath2 may eject all their o star systems ! _    the ejection fractions from the initially not mass - segregated models ( nms3op ) exhibit similar results to the ms3op models .",
    "the difference between the two models is only seen at the lowest cluster mass , @xmath76 .",
    "this can be understood because dynamical mass - segregation is inefficient for the lowest mass clusters due to their low density .",
    "_ initial mass segregation therefore does not have a significant impact on massive - star ejections . _    in the models using the @xcite period distribution ( ms3op_sp and ms3uq_sp ) , the same trend of the o star ejection fraction is present as above , but the @xmath73 values show a much broader peak than those in the model using the @xcite period distribution ( ms3op ) .",
    "the @xmath77 values of the three models are similar ( see table  [ tabresult ] ) . however , for massive clusters ( @xmath78 ) , ms3op_sp clusters not only have a smaller number of o star systems near 3  myr due to a higher fraction of binaries and mergers , but they also eject more o star systems .",
    "the latter suggests that short period massive binaries are dynamically active and boost the ejection of o stars , especially for massive clusters .",
    "the numbers of o - star systems are slightly higher in the ms3uq_sp sequence than in the ms3op_sp sequence ( see table  [ tabresult ] ) because o - star binaries in the ms3op_sp models mostly have an o - star companion while companions of o -star binaries in the ms3uq_sp models are chosen from a broader range of stellar masses . for example , when the binary fraction is unity and both sequences have the same number of individual o stars , for the ms3op_sp sequence the number of o - star systems would be almost half of the number of individual o stars while it would larger than half in the case of the ms3uq_sp sequence",
    ". however , the difference in the mass - ratio distributions of the two model sequences does not seem to affect the trend of the o star ejection fraction as a function of cluster mass having a peak at @xmath79 .",
    "the difference between the results of the ms3op_sp and ms3uq_sp models is only marginal . _ therefore , massive star ejections are not sensitive to the form of the mass - ratio distribution as long as they are paired with other massive stars , i.e. , @xmath80 . _    for single - star clusters ( ms3s ) , we find the same cluster mass at which the peak of the o star ejection fraction occurs although the ejection fractions are about half those of the binary - rich model sequences .",
    "the peak appears at the same cluster mass in the sequences with different initial cluster sizes . in the case of ms8op ( @xmath55  pc ) , the ejection fraction is much smaller than in other model sequences with @xmath58  pc . but @xmath73 reaches @xmath81 per cent in the ms1op model sequence ( initial @xmath61  pc ) at the cluster mass of the peak . _",
    "the dependency of the ejection fraction on cluster mass is thus independent of the initial cluster radius , but more compact cluster do have higher ejection fraction of massive stars . _",
    "the peak near @xmath2 of the ejection fraction can be understood as a consequence of the growth of the number of o stars with cluster mass surpassing the number of ejected o stars as the cluster mass increases and the potential smoothens .",
    "figure  [ nejfig ] shows the average number of ejected o stars at each cluster mass .",
    "this implies that a - few - myr old clusters with a mass at which the o - star ejection fraction peaks would present o star populations most deviating from the number of o stars given by the canonical imf .",
    "for example the estimated stellar mass in the inner 2  pc of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) is @xmath82 @xcite and probably @xmath83 taking account of a probable binary fraction of 50  per cent @xcite . with these cluster masses ,",
    "about 610 stars are expected to have a mass larger than @xmath84 from the canonical imf .",
    "however , only three o - type ( or @xmath85 ) stars are found within @xmath86  pc of the trapezium stars @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the stochastic sampling of the imf .",
    "but the probability for this is less than 5 per cent when stellar masses are randomly drawn from the imf with a stellar upper mass limit of @xmath87 ( but about 10 per cent with @xmath88 ) such that it is more likely that the onc has ejected a significant fraction of its o star content .",
    "furthermore , the initial mass of the cluster may have been higher than observed at the present day as the cluster could have lost a significant fraction of its members during the residual gas expulsion phase @xcite .",
    "thus the onc formed with a mass close to the peak mass we found in this study and could have lost a significant fraction of its massive stars through the dynamical ejection process .",
    "this may explain why the onc s massive star population deviates from the canonical imf @xcite .",
    "examples of such events would be two o - type single runaway stars , ae aur and @xmath89 col , and a massive binary system @xmath90  ori which may have been ejected from the onc through a binary - binary interaction @xcite .",
    "future proper motion surveys , such as with the mission , may provide further constraints on this question , because the putative ejected o stars from the onc would have to become evident .    very massive clusters may have small ejection fractions of o stars but their very upper stellar mass end could lack stars because the ejection fraction of stars more massive than @xmath91 can be from @xmath92 to @xmath93 per cent @xcite . furthermore , they can eject not only very massive single stars but also very massive binaries @xcite .",
    "this bias through the most massive stars being ejected from star - burst clusters and the observed imf of star - burst clusters being close to the canonical value ( e.g. , the r136 cluster in the large magellanic cloud , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may imply the imf to be top - heavy in star - burst clusters @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence for a possibly systematically varying imf above a few @xmath94 : a number of independent arguments have shown the imf to become increasingly top - heavy with increasing star - formation rate density on a pc scale @xcite , with a dependency on the metallicity .",
    "this metallicity dependence is such that metal - rich environments tend to produce a steeper ( i.e. top - light ) imf slope .",
    "evidence for this may have emerged in m31 data @xcite .",
    "the models calculated here are , however , in the invariant regime .",
    "a theoretically expected relation between the ejection fraction and the cluster mass can be found .",
    "first , the number of o stars in a cluster , @xmath95 , which is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath0 , is @xmath96 by using the imf ( equation  ( [ imf ] ) ) .",
    "the normalisation constant , @xmath97 , in equation  ( [ imf ] ) is calculated from @xmath98 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ nofig ] presents @xmath95 as a function of @xmath0 from equation  ( [ eqno ] ) .",
    "since we adopt the @xmath21@xmath0 relation , equation  ( [ eqno ] ) is not a simple linear function of cluster mass especially for low - mass clusters in which @xmath21 is highly dependent on the cluster mass .",
    "@xmath95 , however , becomes almost linearly proportional to @xmath0 for massive clusters where @xmath21 is saturated ( see the upper panel of figure  [ nofig ] ) .",
    "note that the solid line in the upper panel of figure  [ nofig ] and the numbers in table  [ tabresult ] are slightly different because equation  ( [ eqno ] ) gives the number of all _ individual _ o stars from the imf , whereas @xmath99 listed in table  [ tabresult ] is the number of o star _ systems _ at 3  myr .",
    "the difference between the number of o stars from the imf , @xmath95 , and from our @xmath1-body  calculations , @xmath100 , at the cluster mass of @xmath76 in figure  [ nofig ] arises due to our choice of forcing a cluster to have at least one @xmath21-star initially .",
    "this would not have been required if optimal sampling @xcite had been available when the theoretical young star cluster library was computed pre-2013 .",
    "our stellar masses are randomly drawn from the imf with the upper mass limit given by the @xmath21@xmath0 relation .",
    "therefore , our sampling would produce a slightly lower maximum stellar mass in a cluster but a similar number of o stars compared to what random sampling without the @xmath21@xmath0 relation would give . the grey line in the upper panel of figure  [ nofig ]",
    "is the expected number of o stars from the imf with a universal upper stellar - mass - limit of @xmath87 for all cluster masses .",
    "the figure indicates that a higher number of o stars is expected in the imf with a universal and constant @xmath101 than with the @xmath21@xmath0 relation at lower cluster mass ( @xmath102 a few @xmath103 , the black solid line in the same figure ) .",
    "but the values of @xmath99 in our @xmath1-body  models are close to the grey line because of adding one @xmath23-star in a cluster of mass @xmath0 by default .",
    "so whether adopting the relation or not would have little effect on the number of o stars in our models . the proper comparison for outcomes of the two assumptions ( @xmath101 or the @xmath21@xmath0 relation ) can be done by performing a large set of monte carlo calculations .",
    "however , it is beyond the objectives of this study . in any case , the @xmath21@xmath0 relation is observationally well supported for young star clusters and star - forming regions in the milky way given the most recent data @xcite .",
    "fitting the number of o - star systems present , regardless of whether the systems are in the star cluster or ejected , in @xmath1-body  calculations at 3  myr to a simple power law gives , @xmath104 the numbers of o star systems in all model sequences are more or less linearly proportional to the cluster mass as expected from the imf despite various binary fractions .",
    "next , the relation between the number of ejected o stars and cluster mass is needed . according to @xcite , the binary  single star scattering encounter rate , @xmath105 ,",
    "is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the central mass density , @xmath108 the velocity dispersion of the cluster , @xmath109 the core radius , and @xmath110 the semi - major axis of the binary . the semi - major axis can be replaced with the system mass , @xmath111 , and the orbital velocity , @xmath112 , of the binary by using equation ( 8.142 ) in @xcite as , @xmath113 considering binaries with a circular velocity similar to the velocity dispersion of the cluster are dynamically the most active ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 , equation  ( [ eqga ] ) becomes @xmath116 since all our cluster models in a given sequence have the same initial half - mass radius the initial central density is only proportional to the cluster mass .",
    "a binary ejecting an o star after a strong interaction with a single star is likely a binary consisting of o stars since the least massive star is generally ejected after a close encounter between a binary and a single star .",
    "therefore , @xmath111 can be approximated to twice the average mass of o stars in a cluster .",
    "we assume , @xmath117 using the imf ( equation  ( [ imf ] ) ) .",
    "thus @xmath111 is a function of @xmath21 so that @xmath118 . due to the @xmath21@xmath0 relation ,",
    "@xmath111 is thus a function of the cluster mass ( the lower panel of figure  [ nofig ] ) .",
    "the number of ejections is proportional to the encounter rate , @xmath119 the @xmath21@xmath0 relation has only a minor effect on the number of ejected o stars for the massive clusters , i.e. , the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath0 becomes negligible in equation  ( [ eqnej ] ) .",

    "firstly , the velocity dispersion of stars in a cluster increases with cluster mass under the assumption of a constant cluster size ( in general , velocity dispersion is a function of both size and mass of a cluster ) , i.e. , on average stars in more massive clusters have higher velocities .",
    "secondly , a star needs a velocity greater than the escape velocity which also increases with cluster mass , in order to leave its parental cluster . for the ms8op model sequence ( with @xmath55  pc ) , the trend is not as pronounced as in other models since the ejection fractions are small and so are the total number of ejected o - star systems , e.g. , only in total 11 o stars are ejected out of 4 runs in the @xmath18 cluster models .",
    "also in the case of the @xmath76 clusters in the nms3op models ( @xmath58  pc ) only three o star systems are ejected in 100 runs .",

    "for example , in the case of the ms1op models , the mass distributions of the ejected o stars look similar to each other for different cluster masses .",

    "the other studies assign stars to runaways with a large distance from the galactic plane or with a high peculiar ( radial ) velocity .    in most of our cluster models ( with the exception of the ms3op_sp and ms3uq_sp models ) the binary fraction of o stars , whether they are inside a cluster or not , at 3  myr is smaller than the observed o star binary fraction ( @xmath233 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this is the case because dynamical interactions between binaries and other cluster members disrupt binaries , preferentially those with a wide orbit @xcite and because the kroupa period distribution ( which was constrained originally only for late - type stars ) extrapolated in some of the model sequences to the o star regime has a larger fraction of long period binaries compared to the observed distribution of o star binaries ( figure  [ pcdf ] ) .",
    "while the mass of clusters which eject o stars most efficiently is the same for all models ( @xmath234 ) , it has been shown that the dynamical ejection of o stars can be highly sensitive to the initial conditions of star clusters . in this section ,",
    "we further discuss the effects of our choice of initial parameters for massive stars and for the clusters , and the available observational constraints .",
    "the ejection fraction is strongly dependent on the initial cluster radius .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figfej ] the shapes of the curves look similar but the values of the ejection fraction are larger for initially smaller sized clusters . thus it is important to check if our models are comparable to observed young star clusters .",
    "the half - mass densities of our @xmath1-body  models at 3  myr range from @xmath235 to @xmath236 , from @xmath237 to @xmath238 , and from @xmath81 to @xmath239 for initial @xmath61 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241  pc clusters , respectively .",
    "these values are well within the densities of observed young ( @xmath242  myr ) massive ( @xmath243 ) star clusters , classified as star burst clusters in @xcite , which range from 1500 to @xmath244 @xcite . however , caution is due in directly comparing the model cluster densities to the observed values since the observed densities are closer to the central ( i.e. , highest ) densities rather than to the half - mass density . concerning the initial radii of the embedded clusters , these are dynamically sub - pc @xcite .",
    "the initial binary population plays a major role in the dynamical ejections of massive stars ( see the differences between the ms3op and ms3s models ) .",
    "thus it is important to adopt realistic initial binary parameters to understand massive star ejections in reality .",
    "the pairing method for massive binaries adopted in most of our models results in extreme mass - ratios , e.g. , most of them are larger than 0.9 .",
    "this was motivated by the high fraction of twins in observed massive binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite ) , while recent observational studies favour a rather flat mass - ratio distribution for o - type binaries @xcite still excluding random pairing from the imf for this spectral type .",
    "adopting a more realistic initial mass - ratio distribution for o - type binaries may reduce the efficiency of the ejection , though the shape of the @xmath245 ejection fraction as a function of parent birth - cluster mass , is expected to be kept . in this contribution",
    "we include a realistic model for the observed period distribution of o star binaries ( equation  ( [ sp ] ) ) .",
    "the model with the observed period distribution , which reproduces the observed abundance of short period binaries , exhibits a substantial increase of the ejection fraction , by @xmath246 per cent , from massive clusters ( @xmath247 ) . whether the observed distribution is a real initial distribution is still unclear as the observed distribution has been compiled from several clusters which may have already evolved dynamically despite their young ages ( 14  myr ) .",
    "the authors suggested that dynamical evolution would be negligible for such massive close binaries ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "however , the population of massive binaries can evolve through the dynamical interactions with other massive stars / binaries in the clusters ( oh et al . in preparation ) .",
    "moreover , short - period massive binaries are vulnerable for merging either due to stellar evolution or the perturbation - induced collision of the two binary - star companions . thus the effect of dynamical evolution needs to be taken in to account iteratively to find the true initial period distribution of massive binaries .",
    "but this is beyond the aim of this study . for late - type binaries this",
    "has already been performed successfully by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .    unlike the other initial conditions mentioned above",
    ", initial mass segregation does not result in a difference of the o star ejection fraction for clusters with @xmath249 and initially @xmath58  pc due to efficient dynamical mass segregation .",
    "but differences do occur for lowest mass clusters : initially mass - segregated clusters more efficiently eject o stars than non - segregated clusters , as dynamical mass segregation is inefficient to gather massive stars in the core of such clusters . for clusters with larger initial @xmath14 values , as the dynamical mass segregation time scale becomes longer , the initial mass segregation can play a significant role . in observations ,",
    "post gas - expulsion young massive clusters ( age @xmath250  myr ) are generally compact ( effective radii @xmath251 a few  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    throughout this study",
    "the @xmath21@xmath0 relation is adopted .",
    "it follows from an intuitive theoretical concept that the mass of a star forming molecular cloud core is finite and that star formation is a self - regulated process @xcite , and it follows from the data on young stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the existence of a physical @xmath21@xmath0 relation is thus taken to be established @xcite . although the theory has been successful in describing the stellar contents of whole galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been debated if the relation exists ( see section  2.1 in * ? ? ? * for details ) or if star formation is a purely stochastic process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is a fundamental issue for understanding galaxy - wide imfs and how massive stars form , and we here thus stress that the data do not support the hypothesis that star formation is stochastic ( see section  7 of * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite presented that l1641 , the low - density star - forming region ( containing as many as @xmath252 stars ) of the orion a cloud , is deficient of massive ( o and early b ) stars compared to the canonical imf with 34@xmath253 significance and that with a probability of only 3 per cent the southern region of l1461 and the onc can be drawn from the same population supporting that the high - mass end of the imf is dependent on environmental density . in section 4.2 of @xcite three references @xcite are cited as containing evidence against a physical @xmath21@xmath0 relation .",
    "@xcite critically discuss these works showing @xcite data to be entirely consistent with the physical @xmath21@xmath0 relation . as already discussed in section  3 , whether the @xmath21@xmath0 relation is adopted or not does not affect the here obtained results though .",
    "we do not include a gas potential , which would subsequently be removed rapidly , in the calculation ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main outcomes of gas expulsion are significant stellar - loss from and expansion of clusters and their possible subsequent dissolution . therefore gas expulsion can weaken the ejection efficiency by lowering the ( central ) density of a cluster if that occurs at a similar time when a majority of the ejection processes take place . in the future ,",
    "further studies including a gas potential are needed to understand the effect of gas expulsion on the ejection of massive stars .",
    "inclusion of a gas potential will be possible once the statistical quantification of the gas expulsion process is in place and computable ( cf .",
    "it has been argued recently that gas expulsion , if the process occurs at all , may have no effect on star cluster evolution ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it may , however , be difficult to detect the expanding signature resulting from residual gas expulsion since revirialization after gas expulsion can be rapid for massive clusters , @xmath254 @xcite .    to constrain which initial conditions are responsible for the observed field o star populations",
    ", one needs the observed quantities to compare with the results from models .",
    "however , it is very difficult to find which clusters individual field o stars originate from .",
    "some ejected o stars can travel further than a few hundred pc away from their birth cluster within a few myr thus , without knowledge of their full-3d kinematics and the galactic potential , it is almost impossible to find their birth cluster .",
    "may help to find the birth clusters of the field o stars .",
    "however , the two - step ejection process of @xcite complicates this .",
    "their calculation suggests that 14.6 per cent of o stars would appear to have formed in isolation .",
    "they used the observed values of the o star runaway fraction ( 1025 per cent , @xcite ; 46 per cent , @xcite ) , and the binary fraction among the runaways ( 10 per cent , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since most , if not all , ejected o - star  o - star binaries may go through the two - step ejection process and then can not be traced back to their birth cluster , the fraction of o stars which appear to have formed in isolation can be higher if a binary fraction of the dynamically ejected stars is substantial .",
    "a quantitative study is required to determine the fraction of o - stars experiencing the two - step ejection process .",
    "we study how the ejection of o - stars varies with cluster mass ( or density as we assume a constant size for different cluster masses ) under diverse initial conditions .",
    "we find that clusters with a mass of @xmath2 most efficiently shoot out their o stars to the field compared to other ones with other masses , for all models , i.e. , this result obtains independently of radius or the presence of initial mass segregation or binaries .",
    "our results suggest that moderately massive clusters ( @xmath79 ) , which have formed about 10 o star systems , most efficiently eject their o stars through energetic encounters between massive stars in the cluster core . up to on average @xmath255 per cent of the initial o star content is ejected from the clusters with this cluster mass in @xmath58  pc models ( 52 per cent in @xmath61  pc clusters , figure  [ figfej ] ) . however , the spread is large and ejections of all o stars leading to remnant young clusters void of o stars occur in about 1 per cent of all such clusters ( figure  [ figfej ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that one bully binary , dynamically formed , is mainly responsible for flinging out the stars from initially single - star clusters .",
    "here we show that the number of ejections is significantly higher when the highly significant initial massive binary population is accounted for .",
    "the ejections , thus , occur via close encounters involving several binaries in reality since the massive stars are observed to have high multiplicity fractions in young star clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , more realistic clusters , which have o - star binaries with periods following the @xcite distribution ( ms3op_sp ) , lead to even larger ejection fractions , especially for massive clusters .",
    "the mass - position of the peak of @xmath256 , however , does not change ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "the decrease of the o star ejection fraction with increasing cluster mass for massive ( @xmath126 ) clusters can be represented by a simple power - law of cluster mass with an exponent between @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "clusters with an initial half - mass radius @xmath58  pc and with relatively simple initial conditions ( kroupa initial period distribution for o stars or no initial binaries ) have an exponent of @xmath260 being in good agreement with @xmath261 which is derived from the number of o stars from the imf and the binary - single star scattering rate ( equation  ( [ eqfej ] ) ) .",
    "models with a high fraction of close initial binaries or smaller @xmath14 deviate from the expected theoretical value by having larger ejection fractions .",
    "we show that not only the ejection fraction but also the properties of the ejected o star systems depend on the initial cluster mass .",
    "the velocity distribution of the ejected o star systems shifts to higher velocities for more massive clusters , and so does their distance distribution from the cluster .",
    "but the distribution of ejected system masses varies weakly with cluster mass .",
    "the binary fraction of the ejected systems decreases with increasing cluster mass as does the binary fraction of the systems remaining in the cluster because binary disruption via interactions with other members of the cluster is more efficient for a denser cluster , i.e. , more massive cluster .",
    "the binary fraction among the ejected o star systems is substantial , especially in the more realistic models in which the period distribution of the observed o star binaries is implemented ( ms3op_sp and ms3uq_sp ) .    considering that the cluster mass function is approximately a power - law with a near salpeter index , the main fraction of field o stars dynamically ejected from clusters originate from low / intermediate mass clusters (",
    "@xmath102 a few @xmath103 , see section  5 ) .",
    "the dynamical ejection process populates @xmath262 to @xmath263 per cent of all o stars , formed in clusters , to the field . combining our results on the dynamical ejection fraction and the binary - supernova scenario computed by @xcite",
    "it follows that the observed fractions of the galactic field- and runaway o stars are well accounted for theoretically .",
    "it should be noted that very massive ( @xmath264 ) runaways can only originate from massive star - burst clusters ( @xmath265 ) because only massive clusters can harbour a sufficient number of very massive stars to eject some of them .",

    "<S> about 15 per cent ( up to @xmath438 per cent , depending on the cluster models ) of o stars of which a significant fraction are binaries , and which would have formed in a @xmath410  myr epoch of star formation in a distribution of embedded clusters , will be dynamically ejected to the field . </S>",

    "<S> synthesising a young star cluster mass function it follows , given the stellar - dynamical results presented here , that the observed fractions of field and runaway o stars , and the binary fractions among them can be well understood theoretically if all o stars form in embedded clusters . </S>"
