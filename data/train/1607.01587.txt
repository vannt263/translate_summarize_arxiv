    "an important step for understanding the dynamics and phenomenology of astrophysical jets is the study of their instabilities .",
    "instabilities have a substantial importance , on one hand for the formation and evolution of various observed structures and , on the other hand , for dissipating part of the jet energy and leading to the observed radiation .",
    "there are several possible sources of instabilities , like the velocity shear between the jet and the ambient medium , which drives the kelvin - helmholtz instability , the current flowing along magnetic field lines , which drives the current driven instability ( cdi ) and rotation that can drive several kinds of instabilities . since the most promising models for the acceleration and collimation of jets involve the presence of a magnetic field with footpoints anchored to a rotating object ( an accretion disk or a spinning star or black hole ) , the presence of a toroidal field component and of rotation seems to be a natural consequence and both cdi and rotation driven instabilities may play an important role in the jet propagation .",
    "cdi have been , for example , suggested as being responsible for the conversion from poynting to kinetic energy flux in the first phases of jet propagation @xcite .",
    "khi have been extensively studied in several different configurations both in the newtonian ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and relativistic ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cases .",
    "similarly , cdi have been widely studied in the newtonian limit ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the analysis of the relativistic case has been more limited , most of the studies have considered the force - free condition @xcite and only @xcite studied the full mhd case .",
    "the study of the effects of rotation have been mainly focused on the accretion disk problems , where the main instability considered is the magnetorotational instability @xcite , however , the combination of magnetic field and rotation can give rise to several other instabilities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the interplay between the different modes can become quite complex .",
    "our goal is to study these rotation - induced instabilities in the context of magnetized jets .    in @xcite ( hereinafter paper i )",
    "we studied the interplay between khi and cdi in a relativistic non - rotating cold jet configuration , characterized by a current distribution concentrated inside the jet and closing at large distances . in this paper , we introduce the effects of rotation which , however , makes the analysis of the unstable modes much more intricate .",
    "therefore , before tackling the full relativistic case , in this paper we limit ourselves to a newtonian analysis , neglecting again thermal pressure compared with the magnetic one .",
    "moreover , since most of the unstable modes that we will consider are concentrated inside the jet radius and therefore the effect of the jet velocity would be to simply doppler shift their frequencies , in this first step we ignored also the presence of the longitudinal velocity component . the main focus of this paper will then be on the effect of rotation on cdi and on the new modes of instability introduced by rotation .",
    "the effect of rotation on cdi was considered by @xcite who analyzed a rigidly rotating jet and found a stabilizing effect for rotation periods shorter than a few alfvn times .",
    "an analysis of the unstable modes introduced by rotation in a configuration and parameter range similar to ours has been performed by @xcite .",
    "they discuss these modes in the cold plasma limit , however , their study is mainly local , whereas we focus more on global analysis of these instabilities , besides they do not discuss the cdi .",
    "another related works are by @xcite and @xcite , who examined the instabilities of axisymmetric perturbations in the presence of rotation and superthermal magnetic fields .",
    "the treatment of the first paper is again local and mostly focuses on an equilibrium configuration typical of accretion discs , while the second one analyses the stability a rotating cylindrical plasma dean flow with only axial field both with local and global approach .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section we present the equilibrium configuration , in section [ sec : linequations ] we derive the linearized equations , in section [ modeclassification ] we discuss the wkbj local dispersion relation and present energetic considerations based on the frieman - rotenberg approach @xcite .",
    "the local dispersion relation and the energetic considerations will be useful in understanding the nature of the unstable modes that will be discussed in section [ results ] , where we present our results on global modes . finally in the last section [ summary ] we summarize our findings .",
    "we study the linear stability of a cold magnetized cylindrical jet flow .",
    "although in the following we will consider only the zero thermal pressure case , we keep here the presentation more general .",
    "the relevant equations are the equations of ideal mhd : @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the sound speed , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are , respectively , the velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "we remark that a factor of @xmath9 is absorbed in the definition of @xmath8 .",
    "the first step in the stability analysis is to define an equilibrium state satisfying the stationary form of equations ( [ eq : drho / dt]-[eq : dp / dt ] ) and this will be done in the next subsection .",
    "we adopt a cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath10 ( with versors @xmath11 ) and seek for axisymmetric steady - state solutions , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the jet propagates in the vertical ( @xmath13 ) direction , the magnetic field and velocity have no radial component and consist of a vertical ( poloidal ) component @xmath14 , and a toroidal component @xmath15 . the magnetic field configuration can be characterized by the pitch parameter @xmath16    the only non - trivial equation is given by the radial component of the momentum equation ( [ eq : dm / dt ] ) which , in the zero pressure case , simplifies to @xmath17 equation ( [ eq : radial_eqmhd ] ) leaves the freedom of choosing the radial profiles of all flow variables but one and then solve for the remaining profile .",
    "furthermore , we note that the presence of a longitudinal velocity has no effect on the radial equilibrium .",
    "the choice of the radial profiles is somewhat arbitrary since we have no direct information about the magnetic configuration in astrophysical jets .",
    "the choice of the @xmath18 distribution is equivalent to a choice of the distribution of the longitudinal component of the current and also determines the behavior of the pitch parameter @xmath19 , that is important for the stability properties . in principle",
    ", one can then have several equilibria characterized by different forms of the current distribution , that can be more or less concentrated , can peak on the axis or at the jet boundary , and can close in different ways ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our choice is to consider a general class of constant density equilibria in which the vertical current density is peaked on the axis and is concentrated in a region of radius @xmath20 .",
    "the azimuthal component of magnetic field has therefore to behave linearly with radius close to the origin and decay as @xmath21 at large distances , more precisely we can write it as @xmath22 where the function @xmath23 behaves in the following way at small and large radii : @xmath24    for the rotational frequency @xmath25 we assume the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the value of @xmath28 on the axis , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "we make this assumption for simplicity and for avoiding any possible non - monotonic behaviors of @xmath30 .    inserting expressions ( [ eq : bphi ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) in the equilibrium condition ( [ eq : radial_eqmhd ] ) , we can get the profile of @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a monotonic function with @xmath35 and @xmath36 . depending on the value of @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath30 is decreasing ( for @xmath38 ) or increasing ( for @xmath39 ) . from a physical point of view",
    ", if we look at equation ( [ eq : radial_eqmhd ] ) , we can see that the equilibrium is given by the balance of three forces : gradient of @xmath40 , the gradient of @xmath41 and the centrifugal force . when there is no rotation , the gradient of @xmath40 , which always points towards the jet axis , is balanced by the gradient of @xmath41 .",
    "increasing the rotation rate , the gradient of @xmath41 decreases , until , for @xmath42 , @xmath30 becomes constant .",
    "if we still increase rotation beyond this point , the centrifugal term becomes larger than the gradient of @xmath40 , thus @xmath30 has to increase outward for providing an inward force term , needed for having equilibrium .",
    "we can now define a radially averaged alfvn velocity via @xmath43 and inserting the expressions for @xmath18 and @xmath30 from equations ( [ eq : bphi ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) in equation ( [ eq : bav ] ) , we get @xmath44 where @xmath45 from which we get @xmath46 where @xmath47 are , respectively , nondimensional measures of the rotation rate and of the value of the pitch on the axis . for a given choice of the function @xmath23 and the values of these two parameters",
    ", we can derive the value of @xmath48 from equation ( [ eq : hc ] ) and the equilibrium structure is then fully determined .",
    "however not all combinations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are allowed , because , in order to have a physically meaningful solution , we have to impose the additional constraints that @xmath51 and @xmath52 have to be everywhere positive , which translate as @xmath53 respectively , for equations ( [ eq : hc ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) .    in order to exemplify the structure of the equilibrium solution",
    ", we now make a specific choice for the function @xmath23 , @xmath54 which gives the same solution used in paper i. this same solution will also be used in the next sections for computing the instability behavior .",
    "more specifically , we have the following profiles for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath55 @xmath56,\\ ] ] @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the error function , and @xmath59        in fig . 1",
    ", we present the regions in the @xmath60 plane for which the equilibrium is possible . the red curve represents the condition @xmath61 , while the blue curve represents the condition @xmath62 and the green curve represents the combinations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for which @xmath30 is constant .",
    "therefore the green region represents equilibria for which @xmath63 , while in the red region @xmath64 .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the parameters determining the equilibrium : once the magnetization radius @xmath20 and the average alfvn velocity , @xmath65 , are fixed , the equilibrium structure is fully determined by the two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",

    "this asymptotic behaviour of the solutions for small and large radii are used in the numerical integration of the eigenvalue problem . for finding eigenvalues",
    "we use a shooting method with a complex secant root finder , as we did in paper i. the numerical integration can not start at @xmath93 because of the singularity , so we start at a small distance from the origin where the solution is obtained through a series expansion of the equations described in the appendix [ ap : small_r ] .",

    "the properties of the mri in the cold plasma limit , studied in the above papers based on the local dispersion relation , qualitatively agrees with our global calculations . in the nonaxisymmetric case , for positive @xmath84",
    ", the mri is present only in a limited range of wavenumbers , its growth rate and the width of the unstable range reach a maximum for @xmath249 and then ( for larger @xmath84 ) decrease ( fig .",
    "18 ) consistently with @xcite , however , the mri is absent for @xmath246 and for every negative value of @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , we did not find the mri for @xmath129 in both local and global cases , likely because of the different equilibrium adopted . in general , the mri has always a growth rate smaller than that of the buoyancy modes .",
    "we have shown that two main kinds of instabilities  cdi and buoyancy  prevail in the considered jet flow . in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] we represent , in the parameter plane @xmath198 , with different shadings , the regions where each of them has the largest growth rate .",
    "the figure refers to non - axisymmetric modes with @xmath250 .",
    "we can observe that the cdi is dominant at small rotation rates and that the boundary between the cdi and centrifugal buoyancy instability regions moves towards larger values of @xmath49 as we decrease @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath251 , the cdi is stable for this value of the wavenumber and the only instability is the centrifugal buoyancy , which is , however , obviously stable at zero rotation .",
    "it is seen that the buoyancy instability occupies quite a large area in this parameter space in comparison with the cdi and hence should be important in jets with rotation .",
    "when we increase the wavenumber , the cdi tends to be stabilized and the centrifugal instability tends to become dominant everywhere in the parameter plane .",
    "comparing now the growth rates of axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric centrifugal buoyancy modes , we see that at high wavenumbers , axisymmetric modes have a larger growth rate , which decreases monotonically with decreasing @xmath83 .",
    "by contrast , non - axisymmetric modes have a growth rate that is almost independent from the wavenumber and , therefore , become dominant at low values of @xmath83 .",
    "summarizing , at low rotation rates , the non - axisymmetric cdi is the instability that grows fastest and has large wavelengths .",
    "increasing the rotation rate , the prevailing instability becomes the centrifugal axisymmetric one , which operates at small wavelengths .",
    "these results are applicable to magnetically and rotationally dominated jets , since , increasing the importance of thermal pressure , centrifugally driven modes tend to be stabilized and other modes , like pressure driven modes @xcite may appear . at the same time , taking into account the shear of longitudinal velocity can give rise to unstable kh modes in the jet .",
    "this first step will be extended by introducing the effects of the longitudinal velocity also in the relativistic regime and these results will be presented in a following paper .",
    "the different behaviour in the explored parameter space may be important for understanding the nonlinear stages since distinct types of instability may evolve differently .",
    "this study is therefore an essential first step for the interpretation of the results of numerical simulations and for their comparison with astrophysical data .",
