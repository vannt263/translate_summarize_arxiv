    "radio sources from the 3crr sample @xcite whose nuclei are quasars tend to be associated with classical double [ frii , @xcite ] structures .",
    "this sample contains no examples of radio sources clearly having the other characteristic structure , the fri type ( where the brightness decreases with increasing distance from the core ) , powered by quasar nuclei .",
    "this , together with a consistent picture from similar samples , led some to postulate that there is a deep association between the nature of the central engine and whether the radio - structure is type fri or frii @xcite .    in principle",
    ", a survey like 3crr is hindered from finding fri radio structures associated with quasars because of two effects .",
    "first , as pointed out by @xcite , fris have lower radio luminosities than the classical double friis ( see fig.[fig : rqq_fr ] ) ; this means they are not found at high redshifts in a bright flux - limited sample .",
    "second , the rarity of quasars means that searching the requisite large volume of space necessarily involves going out to high redshifts .",
    "an alternative means of finding quasars associated with fri radio structures is to begin with an optical survey of quasars and then make follow - up radio observations to establish the nature of their structures . in the case of the bqs sample of quasars",
    "@xcite the radio structures , when prominent , are only of the classical double frii type .",
    "observations to date show the other quasars appear to have weak , though compact @xcite , radio emission associated with their nuclei .",
    "this indicates a seeming gap in radio luminosity for quasars of a given optical luminosity , as pointed out by e.g.@xcite : at radio luminosities corresponding to the fris from the 3crr sample , there are no bqs quasars .",
    "the absence of evidence of quasars with these radio luminosities ( the radio luminosities of fri radio galaxies in 3crr ) was taken by @xcite as evidence of the absence of these objects in the universe .",
    "this led them to postulate that torus opening angles in fris are too small to observe a quasar nucleus : for most angles to the line - of - sight , the nucleus would be obscured by the torus , while for very small angles to the line - of - sight the nuclear emission would be that of a strongly core - boosted bl lac .",
    "the wider opening angles of frii sources permit a significant fraction of these objects to be observed as quasars .",
    "thus , the seeming absence of fri quasars was taken by @xcite as evidence that the nature of the torus is closely linked to the frii / fri transition .",
    "a possible counter to their claim was the discovery by @xcite of an fri radio structure whose nuclear identification , while not a bona fide quasar , exhibits broad lines . with a projected linear size of @xmath4mpc it seemed most unlikely that this object was being viewed at a very small , favourable angle to the line - of - sight .",
    "examples of fri sources having bona fide quasar nuclei would undermine @xcite s theory .",
    "deep , low - frequency , radio surveys are a means of sampling the high-@xmath5 universe necessary to find rare quasars . however , in the low - radio luminosity regime where fri sources are found , current surveys remain challenged by sensitivity . but despite the limited sky coverage of redshift surveys of deep low - frequency radio sources to date , a low - radio luminosity source from the 38-mhz selected 8c sample @xcite , which we find to have an fri structure over 280kpc in extent , is associated with a well - studied quasar which is optically extremely powerful ( * ? ? ?",
    "* unreddened @xmath6 ) .    what are the chances that optically - selected quasars will be found to have associated fri structures ?",
    "given that optically - powerful quasars are too rare to populate the nearby universe and the consequences of redshift on surface brightness discussed in ",
    "[ sec : redshift ] , the short interferometric snapshots which comprise most observations of these objects to date are inadequate to reveal any such structures .",
    "psychology presumably plays its part in discouraging observers , or at least proposal referees , from making deep radio observations of seemingly ` radio - quiet ' quasars . in ",
    "[ sec : meas ] we briefly describe what our deep observations of e1821 + 643 have revealed . in  [ sec : results ] we discuss the size and luminosity of its elongated emission and consider the stability in jet - axis direction that is implied by the large - scale radio emission . in ",
    "[ sec : redshift ] we consider the detectability , given current technology , of the extended emission if the quasar were located at @xmath7 instead of its true value @xmath8 @xcite .    in  [ sec : sourcephysics ] we discuss the challenges this quasar presents to the implications of the radio bimodality in quasars , the radio - optical correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the assumed mapping between jet power and observable radio luminosity .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath10 , and that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the vla in its bna configuration was used to observe e1821 + 643 at 18 cm for 133 minutes on 14 september 1995 ; the primary flux calibrator was 3c48 and the phase calibrator was 1842 + 681 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures using aips .",
    "fig.[fig : images ] shows that at 18 cm low - surface brightness emission ( which contributes to a total of 47.7mjy associated with the quasar ) is extended over 45@xmath13 ( 280kpc ) , way beyond the confines of its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "previously , extended radio emission had only been known to lie approximately co - spatially with its host galaxy @xcite . despite the somewhat elongated nature of the radio emission @xcite found , they thought it likely that this emission was associated with star formation within the galaxy ;",
    "this was concluded because of the proximity of this quasar to the seemingly tight line of correlation between the far - infra - red and radio luminosities of seyfert galaxies and radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the increased radio emission we have discovered lifts this object further away from that tight correlation .",
    "the total luminosity of this source at 18 cm is @xmath14@xmath15 . at the resolution of the 18 cm image ,",
    "the core component accounts for 15.3mjy / beam , i.e.  half of the luminosity in the extended emission .",
    "its linear extent is 280kpc in the assumed cosmology , and its width is 60kpc .",
    "thus in terms of radio size , luminosity , the ratio of core to total luminosity , host galaxy and cluster environment @xcite , e1821 + 643 is like other fris .",
    "it seems likely that the jet observed on sub - arcsec scales by @xcite produces the extended emission .",
    "fig.[fig : images ] shows their merlin image in which the jet appears to curve from the line joining the core to e , round towards f. this e  f direction is parallel to a ",
    "b on larger scales , which in turn probably represents more recent emission than that along the direction delineated by c  d .",
    "the axis of the inner merlin jet indicates the most recent directionality of the jet - axis .",
    "thus , two clues from these images  taken together  may indicate that the jet is precessing : i ) the curvature of the sub - arcsec jet and ii ) the similarity in direction of the jet - axis a  b on scales of 10s of arcsec compared with e ",
    "f on sub - arcsec scales . this would be in exact analogy to the way the precessing jets of ss433 @xcite give rise to a projected - helical trace on the sky .",
    "it is possible that , as in ss433 , the precession of the jet - axis in this radio - quiet quasar arises from the central engine being a binary .",
    "the changes in jet - axis direction may be the manifestation of the active nucleus containing two super - massive black holes in orbit round one another @xcite .",
    "the outermost ends of the extended emission do not appear to end in shocks ( as might be evinced by an abrupt , rather than a gradual , decrease in surface brightness ) .",
    "this might suggest that the extended emission has grown no faster than the ambient sound speed of the igm .",
    "the sound speed in an ionized gas at temperature @xmath16 k is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the speed of light ; for @xmath19k this gives an assumed transonic advance speed of @xmath20 .",
    "if this were the constant speed at which the plumes had emerged from the radio - quiet quasar , then this would have commenced @xmath21yrs ago so the direction of the jet - axis appears to have remained within a 7degree cone for at least @xmath22yrs . with the a ",
    "b distance being somewhat under half the c  d distance , this still gives that the characteristic time for the stability of the jet axes is @xmath23yrs .",
    "the precession period of ss433 is 163days , @xmath23 times shorter than the likely period of e1821 + 643 ; thus the ratio of precession periods in these very different objects would be similar to the ratio of their masses .",
    "we now consider an estimate of the stability timescale of the optical emission : @xcite found extended line emission 2.5@xmath13 ( 7.5kpc ) from the nucleus in e1821 + 643 , with line ratios typical of nuclear photoionization , suggesting stability over @xmath24yrs .",
    "the width of this emission perpendicular to the mean jet - axis is similar to the width of the radio emission , suggesting that the radio source may be interacting with this gas .",
    "we now consider whether extended radio emission is likely to be a general characteristic of radio - quiet quasars or whether e1821 + 643 is simply an exceptional case .",
    "radio maps of other radio - quiet quasars from e.g.  @xcite and @xcite had an on - source time of only a few minutes , compared with 2hrs for the image we present here : longer integration time brings with it not just a simple increase in signal - to - noise ratio but also substantially better _",
    "uv_-plane coverage .",
    "have previous observations of radio - quiet quasars simply had insufficient surface - brightness sensitivity for diffuse extended radio structures to be detected at even moderate redshifts ?",
    "we performed an experiment similar to one performed by @xcite in a different context : we took our image of e1821 + 643 and calculated what it would look like if instead of being located at the redshift of 0.297 @xcite , it were located at the maximum redshift at which an otherwise identical but unreddened e1821 + 643 could be detected by the bqs survey , namely @xmath25 . for constant @xmath26 over physical sizes exceeding the pixel size ( in kpc at any considered @xmath5 ) , the surface brightness will vary with redshift as @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the spectral index ) , thus the surface brightness of the object at @xmath29 would be lower than if it were at @xmath8 by a factor of 5.4 .",
    "the estimated source structure is shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : images ] : at the risk of stating the obvious _ there would be no reason to deduce the presence of 100kpc - scale emission on the basis of such an image_. for sources at moderate to high redshift , it is difficult to observe any low - luminosity extended emission .",
    "the fri radio galaxies in 3c may differ from e1821 + 643 in that the presence or absence of examples clearly indicating precession requires merlin - scale imaging .",
    "the fri radio galaxies in 3c definitely differ from e1821 + 643 in that their optical luminosities are @xmath30 lower , though their radio luminosities are similar .    _",
    "do any other ` radio - quiet ' quasars have 100-kpc - scale jets _ ( manifested as fris ) ?",
    "figure[fig : rqq_fr ] clearly demonstrates that with plausible radio spectral indices , and given current sensitivity at low - frequency , the relevant part of parameter space is not sampled , so for the time being this question remains unanswered , though it is possible that some do have such jets ( e.g.  those with elliptical hosts ) and some do not ( e.g.  those with spiral hosts ) .",
    "only if the answer to this question turns out to be negative ( after deeper exposures at low-@xmath5 with existing facilities , and ultimately with e - merlin , e - vla , lofar and ska , have sampled this parameter space ) would it be possible to posit a bimodality , rather than a continuity , in the luminosities of the jet output of quasars .",
    "implicit in the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite was the view that there is a physical dichotomy between ` radio - loud ' objects ( which channel power into jets of the same order as is released by accretion ) and ` radio - quiet ' objects ( whose jet powers are a negligible fraction of the bolometric accretion luminosity ) .",
    "this view does not rest easily with the optically - powerful e1821 + 643 since it has nearly all of the attributes (  [ sec : results ] ) of a low - jet - power fri radio source and is therefore intermediate between high - power friis and classically ` radio - quiet ' objects .",
    "one way of retaining a physical dichotomy would be to postulate a different mapping between jet power and observed low - frequency radio luminosity in ( at least ) this fri .",
    "could fri - like structures from optically - powerful nuclei emerge from different physical processes ?",
    "we speculate that the radio luminosity of some radio - quiet quasars may be reduced by significant precession in their jet - axes .",
    "this precession could arise if insufficient time has elapsed for orbiting black holes in the central engine to have coalesced .",
    "the correlation with radio luminosity of the structural classifications of @xcite is one of the most persistent and robust correlations in astronomy : there are _ no _ examples of highly radio - luminous fris .",
    "this suggests that high jet power is necessary for a highly collimated non - dissipative jet which is ultimately capable of forming compact hotspots and a characteristic frii structure .",
    "as lower jet powers are considered , a jet may be more likely to disrupt and dissipate within a few kpc of the cores , characteristic of fris [ see e.g.  @xcite ] , but giving a low luminosity source . the density and inhomogeneity of the environment into which the jet is expanding determines the exact threshold value of jet power above which a jet can give rise to an frii and below which a jet will give rise to an fri . for a given jet power ,",
    "if the jet axis is precessing , this may favour the disruption and hence dissipation of the jet , lowering the likelihood of an frii .",
    "our discovery of an fri radio structure associated with an unusually - nearby optically - powerful quasar , together with consideration of the inadequecy of existing observations of optically - similar objects to reveal similar radio structures , overturn previous assertions that quasar nuclei can not be associated with fri radio structures .",
    "the _ large - scale _ radio emission of e1821 + 643 , elongated way beyond the quasar s host galaxy , is powered by oppositely directed jets which appear to precess on timescales which are scaled up in approximate proportion with the mass of the central engine compared to the galactic radio jetted source , ss433 .",
    "we speculate that the central engine in this quasar may be composed of two black holes which have yet to coalesce ( cf .",
    "any precession in the jet - axis of a radio source may smear out its extended radio emission and promote dissipation in the jet , affecting its potential to form an frii structure , hindering its detectability at radio wavelengths .",
    "the ubiquity of precession as a means by which lower radio luminosity is manifested from highly - accreting yet ` radio - quiet ' quasars remains to be established .",
    "this is essential to developing our understanding of the quasar phenomenon , and beckons the emerging generation of radio telescopes such as e - merlin , e - vla , lofar and ska .",
