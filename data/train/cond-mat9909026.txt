    "in a magnetized charged - particle system edge effects are of paramount importance . an illustration of this fact is furnished by the phenomenon of landau diamagnetism @xcite , which is due to electric currents flowing near the boundaries of the sample . as a further example one may mention quantum hall systems for which the relevance of edge effects has amply been shown .",
    "the analysis of the influence of the boundary on the properties of a quantum many - body system is a difficult mathematical problem .",
    "even if the bulk properties of the unconfined system are understood , the presence of the edge leads to a boundary - value problem that is often difficult to solve analytically .",
    "leaving out the interparticle interaction simplifies this problem quite a lot , although even in that case the analysis remains complicated .",
    "a physical system that is particularly relevant in this context is the non - interacting electron gas in a uniform magnetic field in the presence of a confining hard wall .",
    "in fact , this is the system in which landau diamagnetism , with currents flowing near the edge , can be studied in its purest form .",
    "several methods have been devised to analyse edge effects in the confined magnetized free - electron gas . at zero temperature",
    "one may try to solve the eigenvalue problem in terms of distorted landau levels and determine the edge currents by summing the contributions of the lowest - lying eigenfunctions . even for a simple flat geometry this leads to a rather involved mathematical analysis in terms of parabolic cylinder functions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , we studied the profiles of the particle density and the electric current density along these lines @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach starts by focusing on the high - temperature regime , where maxwell - boltzmann statistics applies .",
    "in that case a convenient tool is furnished by the one - particle temperature - dependent green function . as shown by balian and bloch @xcite the green function for the confined system can be related to that of the corresponding system without boundaries by making a systematic expansion that accounts for an increasing number of reflections of the particles against the confining wall .",
    "the ensuing multiple - reflection expansion was used in recent years @xcite , @xcite to determine the profiles of the particle density and the ( electric ) current density for small values of the magnetic field .",
    "these small - field profiles had been found before from perturbation theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be difficult to generalize these results for the profiles to arbitrary field strength and to relate them to those obtained by means of the eigenvalue method .",
    "some time ago auerbach and kivelson @xcite invented a path - integral method to analyse boundary effects in green functions . by suitably decomposing the relevant paths near the edge they derived a so - called ` path - decomposition expansion ' ( pdx ) for the one - particle green function .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to see whether the use of pdx may shed light on the difficulties mentioned above and whether it may lead to new results on the profiles of physical quantities for arbitrary field strength , both for the high - temperature region and in the regime of high degeneracy .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start by a review of the path - decomposition expansion and its derivation from the feynman - kac path integral .",
    "particular attention will be given to the convergence of the pdx series .",
    "it will be shown that a suitable resummation can greatly enhance that convergence .",
    "the connection with the multiple - reflection expansion will be established .",
    "subsequently , the extension of the method so as to include magnetic fields will be discussed by starting from the feynman - kac - it representation .    for the specific case of a non - interacting charged - particle system in a uniform magnetic field , and confined by a hard wall parallel to the field , the general form of the terms in the pdx series can be established in detail .",
    "that result will be used to determine the first few terms of the asymptotic expansion for the profiles of the particle density and the current density .",
    "this asymptotic expansion is valid far from the edge and in the high - temperature regime .",
    "in contrast to earlier work we will not need to restrict ourselves to small field strengths , as we shall establish the full field dependence of the profiles . as it turns out ,",
    "the precise knowledge of the asymptotic profiles for high temperatures and arbitrary fields is essential in determining how the profiles for the degenerate case depend on the filling of the landau levels .",
    "consider a particle in an external potential @xmath2 , i.e.  with the hamiltonian @xmath3 where we have chosen units in such a way that the particle mass drops out .",
    "the equilibrium quantum statistical properties of a set of particles moving in the potential @xmath4 is governed by the temperature green function @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the inverse temperature .",
    "its path - integral representation is given by the feynman - kac formula @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 describes the path and @xmath9 is the conditional wiener measure @xcite .    if a hard wall confines the particles to a region of space , the potential can be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a steep wall potential and @xmath12 is a smooth external potential .",
    "exact evaluation of ( [ eq : feynman - kac ] ) for the confined problem is in general not possible , even if the corresponding unconfined problem can be solved completely . in this section",
    "we will explore the use of the so - called ` path - decomposition expansion ' ( pdx ) , first introduced by auerbach and kivelson @xcite , to determine the green function of the confined problem .    to simplify matters , consider the one - dimensional case , with a hard wall at @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 . as a first step , we split the green function into two parts @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the green function for the problem without a wall . in order to calculate it",
    ", one needs to specify the potential @xmath20 for @xmath21 as well .",
    "we will take the latter to be the analytical continuation of the potential for @xmath22 .",
    "we shall assume that the resulting @xmath20 is such that @xmath19 can be evaluated in closed form .",
    "the second term of ( [ eq : split ] ) is the difficult part .",
    "it is a correction that contains contributions from all paths crossing the boundary at least once , with an additional minus sign so as to compensate the corresponding contributions in @xmath19 . in order to calculate @xmath23 ,",
    "one discretizes the path integral in the usual way by introducing @xmath0 evenly spaced grid points at @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "subsequently , one decomposes the paths at the boundary @xcite . here ` decomposing ' means that the paths are split into two at the point @xmath26 , where they cross the boundary for the last time . choosing this ` point of no return ' between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , one writes the path integral for @xmath23 as @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 both positive .    in the small interval between @xmath27 and @xmath28 the potential @xmath12",
    "can be ignored , since the error will vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "hence , we may use in that interval the ` free ' propagator @xmath32 $ ] , where we have put @xmath33 .",
    "the free propagator satisfies the identity @xmath34 this identity , which is a generalization of that used in @xcite , follows directly by differentiation of the relation @xmath35^{-1/2 } \\rme^{-a^2/\\tau - b^2/(1-\\tau ) }    = \\pi { \\mathop{\\mathrm{erfc}}\\nolimits}(a+b ) \\quad\\quad ( a>0,\\ , b>0)\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath36 . using ( [ eq : identity ] ) with @xmath21 and @xmath37 in ( [ eq : correction ] ) , we get @xmath38 the integral over @xmath39 can be extended to the interval @xmath40 $ ] , if a compensating factor @xmath41 is inserted .",
    "in fact , only small values of @xmath39 contribute anyway , at least in the continuum limit , owing to the presence of the second @xmath42 function . for these small values of @xmath39",
    "the integrand is approximately invariant under a change of sign of @xmath39 .",
    "subsequently , we may join the two @xmath42 into one , so that we get a closed integral relation @xmath43 for positive @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this integral relation is the pdx formula derived in @xcite .",
    "since the right - hand side contains the original green function @xmath44 , we can iterate this integral equation by inserting ( [ eq : split ] ) . in this way we arrive at the pdx series : @xmath45    to study the convergence of the pdx series we look at the special case of a vanishing external potential @xmath12 . the green function for a free particle in the presence of a hard wall",
    "can be calculated using a reflection principle .",
    "it reads @xmath46 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 positive .",
    "since the first term is @xmath19 , the second term must be the correction @xmath23 . to check the validity of ( [ eq : mre_i ] ) for the present case ,",
    "we employ ( [ eq : identity ] ) repeatedly , with the result @xmath47 this is indeed identical to ( [ eq : g_free ] ) .",
    "it is clear that all terms in ( [ eq : mre_i ] ) are necessary to reproduce the correct result .",
    "in addition , we can not change the order of integration and taking the limit in ( [ eq : mre_i ] ) .",
    "in fact , since one has @xmath48 , this would give an incorrect result .",
    "this suggests that ( [ eq : mre_i ] ) is not the most convenient form to use .",
    "a slightly different series is obtained by modifying ( [ eq : pdx_i ] ) as follows : @xmath49 where the limit @xmath50 is the average of the limits @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath53 vanishes for @xmath54 , at least for a hard wall , we have merely added zero to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : pdx_i ] ) . if we iterate ( [ eq : pdx_ii ] ) , with ( [ eq : split ] ) inserted , we get the resummed pdx series @xmath55    let us consider again the case @xmath56 .",
    "one easily verifies that the correction @xmath23 is given by the second term of ( [ eq : mre_ii ] ) alone .",
    "the convergence of the resummed pdx series is thus found to be much better than that of of the original one .",
    "all higher - order terms in ( [ eq : mre_ii ] ) vanish separately in the present case , since one may prove @xmath57 note that here we are allowed to interchange the order of integration and taking the limit .",
    "this property is an additional advantage of the series in ( [ eq : mre_ii ] ) . returning to the general case with @xmath58",
    ", we expect that both favourable properties of the resummed pdx series ( fast convergence and invariance under interchange of the order of integration and taking the limit ) are conserved . of course",
    ", in general the series will no longer terminate after the second term .",
    "nevertheless , in some applications only a few terms in the expansion are relevant , as we shall see in the following .",
    "the resummed pdx series ( [ eq : mre_ii ] ) is of the general form @xmath59 where we put @xmath60 .",
    "the term of order @xmath0 involves @xmath0 positions at the boundary .",
    "it can be seen as arising from paths along which the particle hits the boundary @xmath0 times .",
    "these multiple reflections at the boundary form the basis of the multiple - reflection expansion , which was derived by balian and bloch @xcite quite some time before the path - decomposition expansion was written down .",
    "a close inspection shows that the two expansions are completely equivalent .    note that in principle the pdx formula ( [ eq : pdx_i ] ) and the pdx series ( [ eq : mre_i ] ) can be applied to any problem involving distinct spatial regions , for example to tunneling problems @xcite . in contrast , the modified pdx formula ( [ eq : pdx_ii ] ) depends on the presence of a _ hard _ wall .",
    "the application of the resummed pdx series ( [ eq : mre_ii ] ) is likewise limited to hard - wall problems only .",
    "we will now apply the methods of the previous section to a confined free - electron gas in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath61 where @xmath11 is again a hard - wall potential . because of the symmetry of the problem we will choose the landau gauge @xmath62 .",
    "the factor @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the charge of the particles , has been absorbed in the constant @xmath65 .",
    "the presence of the vector potential complicates matters . the feynman - kac representation ( [ eq : feynman - kac ] ) of the path integral",
    "is no longer valid .",
    "we have to use the feynman - kac - it formula instead , which in the special case of @xmath66 reads @xcite @xmath67.\\ ] ] if we let @xmath68 denote the @xmath30-component of the path , we can replace the exponential factor containing @xmath11 by @xmath69 . since the factor that contains the vector potential is independent of @xmath70 ,",
    "the integral over the @xmath70-component of the path gives a trivial factor @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the part of the green function that depends on @xmath30 and @xmath72 will be denoted by @xmath73 in the following .",
    "the path integral over the @xmath72-component of the path can be evaluated by a fourier - transform technique .",
    "in fact , discretizing the @xmath30- and @xmath72-components of the path , with @xmath0 intermediate points , we write @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the integral in the exponent of ( [ eq : feynman - kac - ito ] ) is then given by @xmath77 ( in it s convention ) .",
    "we get @xmath78     \\theta(x_m ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\exp \\left [ \\rmi ( y_m - y_{m-1 } ) b x_{m-1 } \\right ]     \\delta ( { \\bi{r}}_{n+1 } - { \\bi{r}}').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integrals over @xmath79 can now be carried out by using the standard fourier representation of the dirac @xmath80-function .",

    "since there is no bulk current , the @xmath106 term of the pdx series does not contribute to the current density .    to determine the profiles of the excess particle density and the current density for arbitrary distances from the wall we need to evaluate all terms in the resummed pdx series .",
    "however , the @xmath26-integral in ( [ eq : second_reflection ] ) can not be carried out analytically .",
    "likewise , evaluation of the multiple @xmath26-integrals in the higher - order terms given in [ app : higher_reflections ] is in general not possible .    for large distances from the wall ( in units of the magnetic length @xmath110 ) the leading contribution to",

    "the asymptotic expression for the excess particle density at large @xmath137 follows by substituting ( [ eq : g_mb ] ) in ( [ eq : rho ] ) : @xmath138 where we have used that @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 in terms of @xmath122 . in a similar way an asymptotic expression for the current density at large @xmath119 can be derived . in leading order",
    "it is found to be proportional to the asymptotic excess particle density : @xmath141 with @xmath142 given in ( [ eq : rho_mb ] ) .",
    "this simple proportionality ceases to be valid , if higher - order terms are incorporated in the asymptotic expansion . comparing ( [ eq : j_y_mb ] ) to ( [ eq : j_y ] ) we see that there is a compensation between the term proportional to @xmath107 and the term that contains the derivatives of the green function . for the @xmath106 contribution",
