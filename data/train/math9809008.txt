    "the present work was originally motivated by a question of dolgachev about k@xmath0 mirror symmetry on the  famous 95 \" ( see section [ sec : data ] for this application ) , but became focused on techniques for exhibiting and analyzing elliptic fibrations on k3 surfaces ( see sections [ sec : cdg ] and [ sec : comp ] in particular ) .",

    "computation of @xmath24 is nontrivial .",
    "we are able to accomplish it for the generic members of the  famous 95 \" families because of the fortunate conjunction of two properties : ( 1 ) they are hypersurfaces in special weighted projective spaces , so we can determine the rank of @xmath24 ( see section [ sec : rhos ] ) , and ( 2 ) they are nondegenerate hypersurfaces in toric varieties , so we can easily and explicitly desingularize them ( see section [ ssec : tc ] ) .",

    "to desingularize @xmath26 , we use the combinatorics of the newton polytope @xmath1 . recall that singularities of @xmath26 are inherited from @xmath2 .",

    "in fact , we may ignore vertices of @xmath1 because @xmath26 does not intersect the corresponding torus orbits ( @xcite ) . to check whether an edge @xmath121 of @xmath1 encodes a singularity , we look at the dual cone generated by vectors @xmath122 normal to the incident faces @xmath123 .",

    "the structure of @xmath1 completely determines the intersections of the curves produced by desingularization and those which arise from faces of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , any two faces @xmath123 of @xmath1 intersect in an edge @xmath121 of @xmath1 .",

    "the intersection matrix of this graph ( henceforth referred to as the _ desingularization graph _ ) is a bilinear form , which is a lattice .",
    "this lattice is of the same rank as pic@xmath119 , generated by curves on the surface , and is certainly a sublattice of finite index of pic@xmath119 .",
    "we now lay the groundwork for forming elliptic fibrations from the desingularization graph .",
    "section [ sec : comp ] describes how to analyze these fibrations to obtain pic@xmath119 .",
    "an elliptic fibration is a regular map @xmath130 from a surface @xmath6 to some base curve @xmath131 , such that the general fibre @xmath132 is an elliptic curve .    because the surfaces we study are k@xmath0 , the base curve is isomorphic to @xmath133 .",

    "we see by using riemann - roch that @xmath137 has projective dimension 1 ; using an argument similar to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* viii.17.3 ) , we can show it has empty base locus .",
    "thus @xmath138 determines a map from @xmath6 to @xmath133 .",
    "application of bertini then shows that the generic element of @xmath138 is smooth .    in practice , we want to partition each output graph into collections of subgraphs corresponding to fibres , sections , and multisections . in this context , @xmath21 is the intersection matrix of a section with an irreducible fibre .",
    "we begin by finding a fibre , then mark all adjacent vertices as sections / multisections , and partition the remaining subgraph into other fibres and sections / multisections if possible .",
    "however , sometimes we will be left with a collection of vertices which do not form any elliptic fibre .",
    "[ thm : com ] suppose on the k@xmath0 surface @xmath6 there exists a fibration @xmath136 with exhibited fibre @xmath135 .",

    "the proof of lemma [ thm : com ] is left to the reader .    in terms of partitioning output graphs ,",
    "lemma [ thm : com ] allows us to add vertices to subgraphs to form extended dynkin diagrams .",
    "the effects of lemma [ thm : com ] can be seen in terms of linear algebra as well .",
    "for example , suppose the addition of only one curve is necessary to complete a fibre .",
    "the extended dynkin diagrams have positive semidefinite forms , so the determinants of their intersection matrices are zero .",
    "the intersection matrix associated to an incomplete fibre has nonzero determinant . when we complete the fibre by adding one curve , the rank of the associated matrix ( and thus that of the fibration ) does not increase because the determinant becomes zero .",
    "if there is more than one way to complete a fibre with the same ( minimal ) number of curves , more information is necessary to decide which fibre exists .",
    "the discriminant of the original intersection matrix gives us a finite number of possibilities ( see section [ sec : int ] ) for the discriminant of the fibration . usually comparing the discriminant of the proposed fibration to that of the original matrix is sufficient to determine which fibre we have .",
    "one of the most useful tools in analyzing possible elliptic fibrations is the shioda - tate formula .",
    "let @xmath140 be an elliptic fibration ( with section ) of a smooth surface @xmath6 , and let @xmath141 be the rank of @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the rank of the mordell - weil group of sections , and @xmath145 ranges over all fibres ( note that irreducible fibres will not contribute to the sum ) .",
    "the number @xmath146 corresponds to the contribution from a section and an irreducible fibre .    most of the time we will find a fibration which shows that @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath148 is finite .",
    "when we have shown that @xmath147 , we have also shown that our fibration generates a finite - index sublattice of @xmath24 because the rank is the same as that of @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we have    [ lem : nam ] @xmath149 this follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary1.7 ) .",
    "if we know that @xmath148 is finite , we have additional information which gives us an upper and lower bound on @xmath150 = the number of sections .",
    "our lower bound is the number of sections we have exhibited in the fibration .",
    "the upper bound is given by the gcd of the orders of @xmath151 , because the torsion subgroup of @xmath148 ( which in our case equals @xmath148 ) embeds in the discriminant group of each fibre @xcite .",
    "often the bounds on @xmath150 and the use of lemma [ lem : nam ] will be enough to tell us that @xmath148 is trivial ( at which point we are done , as we have then shown that the index in @xmath152 ) .",
    "[ ex:1st ] figure [ fig:26i ] shows the _ mathematica _ output for surface family number 26 .",
    "vertex 2 came from a face with one interior point , and so is a curve of genus 1 ; by [ thm : fib ] , it is the generic fibre for an elliptic fibration .",
    "we know from our desingularization calculations ( theorem [ thm : rk ] , section [ ssec : tc ] ) that @xmath153 .",

    "this reducible fibre also intersects each of curves 4 and 8 exactly once , as every section intersects each fibre once .",
    "finally , using theorem [ thm : com ] we must complete the remaining labeled curves 13 - 17 into a fibre or fibres .",
    "we know that each of these must be part of a different reducible fibre because a section intersects each fibre with multiplicity one , and section 4 intersects each of these curves with multiplicity one .",
    "the only fibre which conforms to these constraints is @xmath155 .",
    "furthermore , we can only choose @xmath155 or we will violate the shioda - tate formula .",

    "application of shioda - tate shows that @xmath147 , and formula [ lem : nam ] reads as @xmath169 .",
    "thus @xmath170 .",
    "note that @xmath171 has index 2 in @xmath168 . in [ sec : int ] , we will show more generally how to determine @xmath29 when its discriminant does not match that of the fibration . in cases where different fibrations produce seemingly different @xmath29",
    ", we reconcile the discrepancy using the isomorphism relations on the forms corresponding to the two lattices ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we will now resolve the uncertainties raised by the first fibration ( figure [ fig:651 ] ) for number 65 .",
    "more generally , we use intermediate lattice calculations when we have exhibited more than one section , especially when the number of exhibited sections divides @xmath175 . first ,",

    ".calculation of @xmath190 for number 26 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this data corresponds to the form @xmath195 .",
    "we must also retain the original form on the first two copies of @xmath181 ( @xmath196 ) because they were not involved in the calculation ; they correspond to the zero - entries we suppressed above .",
    "we have only computed @xmath197 for one of the three distinct @xmath37-isotropic subgroups .",
    "number 26 is very illustrative in that the other two intermediate lattices are @xmath198 and @xmath199 , neither of which is isomorphic to @xmath200 .",
    "this creates another question : which one is correct ?",
    "we need to look on the desingularization graph for other fibrations which confirm that one of these choices is correct and that the others are not possible .",
    "( it turns out that only @xmath201 is possible ; see @xcite . )    those hypersurface families for which we used intermediate lattice calculations are 15 , 16 , 23 , 26 , 29 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 35 , 46 , 52 , 54 - 56 , 65 , 68 , 73 - 76 , 80 , 83 , 84 , 86 , 92 ; details are in @xcite",
    ".      sometimes we ll only be able to find a fibration which has only multisections , and no sections .",
    "[ thm : jac ] let @xmath202 be an elliptic fibration .",
    "then there exists a fibration @xmath203 with the following properties : @xmath204 @xmath205 has a section @xmath204 each fibre of @xmath206 is isomorphic to some fibre of @xmath83 @xmath204 if @xmath206 has a section , then @xmath207 .",
    "we refer to @xmath203 in theorem [ thm : jac ] as the _ jacobian fibration_. one way to construct @xmath208 from @xmath6 is to take the jacobian variety of the generic fibre @xmath209 and realize this as the generic fibre of some elliptic surface which has a section . by theorem [ thm : jac ] , the fibres of the jacobian fibration are the same as those of the non - jacobian fibration ; likewise , @xmath210 .    in number 19 ( figure [ fig : fib19 ] )",
    "we immediately see that curves 2 , 7 - 10 form a @xmath211 .",
    "thus curve 6 is a 2-section and we can add a curve , intersecting curve 1 twice , to form an @xmath155 .",
    "we can show that this must be a non - jacobian fibration using direct computations on the intersection matrix .",
    "( in practice , we show by trial and error that if a section existed for the fibration , then the rank of the intersection matrix would exceed @xmath141 . ) for our example , number 19 , there is no fibration in which one can exhibit a section and satisfy shioda - tate with @xmath157 . however , the jacobian fibration associated to figure [ fig : fib19 ] satisfies shioda - tate with @xmath157 ; @xmath212 so we have 7 = 2 + 4 + 1 .    in other words ,",
    "a non - jacobian fibration gives us information about @xmath213 and what we now need to know is the relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath214 .",
    "we have shown ( @xcite ) that there exists a map @xmath215 of finite index @xmath77 , where @xmath77 is the index of multisections ( the gcd of degrees of multisections ) .",
    "as @xmath213 is easy to compute , this map along with application of lattice theory completely determine @xmath24 .",
    "the current proof of existence uses moduli spaces of sheaves ; we are convinced that there is a more direct proof and are working to complete one .",
    "this map was used to calculate pic@xmath119 in the nine cases for which we exhibited non - jacobian fibrations ( numbers 2 , 6 , 18 , 19 , 31 , 33 , 53 , 62 , 69 ; details in @xcite ) . in each case",
    ", we showed that the existence of a section increases the picard number .",
    "the intersection matrix for each desingularization graph represents a quadratic form , which is calculable .",
    "this is particularly useful when we can not find a suitable fibration , or when we can not show that @xmath148 is finite .",
    "because the intersection matrix has rank equal to @xmath27 , it is of finite index in @xmath24 .",
    "thus , if the discriminant of the matrix is square - free , the index is 1 and we need merely determine the corresponding form .",
    "( this was true for every case where @xmath148 was of indeterminate rank . )",
    "if the discriminant is not square - free , then there are a finite number of possibilities for @xmath24 as per section [ sec : int ] .",
    "the matrices have dimension @xmath216 , and rank @xmath141 , so to determine the discriminant of such a matrix we must find the minimum value of the determinants of the @xmath217 minors .",
    "it should be mentioned that there is no general algorithm for determining the quadratic form which corresponds to a matrix .",
    "one must decide based on the values of the form on its generators and on the relations between these generators .",
    "those surfaces for which we computed pic@xmath119 from the matrix are 3 , 7 , 8 , 17 , 21 , 36 , 63 , 66 , 89 , 94 , 95 ; details are in @xcite .",
    "before presenting the available data on the  famous 95 , \" we briefly describe the original motivation for our work .",

    "it is described completely in @xcite that the  strange duality \" of dolgachev and gabrielov for the 14 arnold singularities is a k@xmath0 analogue to the more recently studied calabi - yau threefold mirror symmetry .",
    "the question arises : can one find a larger class of surfaces which mirror each other ?",
