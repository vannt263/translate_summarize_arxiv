    "short loops are abundant in finite - dimensional ferromagnetic spin models and spin glass models .",
    "they cause complicated and strong local correlations in the systems .",
    "the accumulation and propagation of these local correlations then lead to long - range correlations and the emergence of various collective behaviors .",
    "the cluster variation method ( cvm ) is a general theoretical framework for treating local correlations in many - body statistical systems .",
    "the original idea of the cluster variation method was conceived by professor ryoichi kikuchi ( 1919 - 2003 ) in @xmath0 @xcite . since",
    "then cvm has been applied to many different types of systems and has been further developed and generalized @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of cvm is to decompose the entropy of the whole system into the residual entropy contributions of various clusters of spin variables . after this decomposition ,",
    "the true entropy of the system is approximated by the sum of residual entropy contributions from a properly chosen subset of spin clusters , see @xcite or section  2.2 of @xcite for a brief introduction .",
    "the celebrated bethe - peierls tree approximation @xcite is an important limiting case of the cluster variation method .",
    "this tree approximation plays a central role in the mean - field theory of spin glasses @xcite , and it is also underlying the widely used belief propagation ( bp ) message - passing algorithm in information science @xcite . for various spin glass problems defined on finite - connectivity random graphs , due to the absence of short loops , the bethe - peierls approximation or its extended version ( with the possibility of ergodicity breaking in the configuration space being considered ) can give asymptotically exact results in the thermodynamic limit ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "but the bethe - peierls approximation is inadequate in treating strong local correlations and therefore it performs poorly on finite - dimensional spin glass systems .",
    "considering more local correlations beyond the level of bethe - peierls approximation is conceptually easy within the cvm framework , but for strongly disordered and frustrated spin glass systems this task is practically quite challenging .",
    "there are two major issues : ( a ) how to construct a suitable variational marginal probability distribution for each chosen cluster of spin variables ?",
    "( b ) how to efficiently minimize the total kikuchi cluster variational free energy , a complicated function of a large set of parameters ?",
    "yedidia and co - authors proposed in @xcite a particular way of constructing cluster marginal probability distribution functions , and then they suggested a generalized belief propagation ( gbp ) message - passing approach to minimize the resulting kikuchi variational free energy .",
    "this gbp message - passing approach outperforms the bp message - passing approach considerably in terms of numerical precision , but its widespread applications on finite - dimensional spin glass systems are still hindered by two important drawbacks : first , the gbp equations are often redundant ; and second , it is quite a non - trivial task to make the gbp iteration converges to a fixed point .    in this work",
    "we understand the cluster marginal probability distribution functions of @xcite from the viewpoint of the equilibrium partition function , and give an alternative and simple derivation of the gbp equations . based on this derivation",
    "we propose a natural and systematic way of removing the redundance of the gbp equations .",
    "the resulting simplified generalized belief propagation ( sgbp ) equations are much more convenient for numerical implementation compared with the original gbp equations .",
    "we also point out that , for a given system , a subset of the sgbp equations can be safely ignored in the numerical iteration process .",
    "as redundance is minimized , the iteration process based on sgbp is much more easier to converge to a fixed point .",
    "we demonstrate the good performance of the sgbp equations by applying these equations to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ferromagnetic ising model and edwards - anderson spin glass model .",

    "the indices of the vertices are denoted as @xmath3 $ ] and those of the interaction terms as @xmath4 $ ] .",

    "let us mention the edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin glass system on a finite - dimensional regular lattice @xcite .",
    "the vertices are then the lattice sites , each of them having a binary spin state ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "such a bipartite graph is referred to as a factor graph in the literature @xcite .",
    "each edge in the factor graph is between a small circle and a small square . if and",
    "only if a vertex @xmath5 is involved in an interaction @xmath12 , then there will be an edge connecting the corresponding small circle and small square in the factor graph .",
    "as an example , figure  [ fig:2drg : a ] shows part of the factor graph for the ea model ( [ eq : eah ] ) on a periodic square lattice .",
    "the partition function of system ( [ eq : totalenergy ] ) has the sum - product form @xmath21 the inverse temperature @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the temperature ( we shall set boltzmann s constant @xmath24 in the following discussions ) .",

    "the free energy and the partition function therefore have fundamental importance in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "but exactly computing the partition function ( and the free energy ) is an impossible task generically .",
    "many numerical schemes have been developed over the years to obtain good approximate values for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "a well - known theoretical framework for performing approximation is kikuchi s cluster variation method @xcite .",
    "however , the variational problem of minimizing the kikuchi cluster free energy is rather difficult to solve , especially for spin glass systems with quenched random parameters . yedidia , freeman , and weiss @xcite demonstrated that the minimal points of the kikuchi variational free energy correspond to fixed points of a set of self - consistent generalized belief propagation ( gbp ) equations .",
    "minimisation of the kikuchi cluster free energy was therefore turned into the problem of constructing a fixed point for the gbp equations , which can be achieved through an iterative message - passing process on a region graph ( see next subsection ) .",
    "unfortunately , the gbp iterative process is still computationally demanding , especially when the underlying region graph are redundant .    in this work",
    "we will give an alterative and simple derivation of the gbp equations starting from the partition function ( [ eq : partitionfunction ] ) .",
    "an advantage of this derivation is that it suggests a natural way of simplifying the gbp equations on redundant region graphs .",
