    "@xmath5@xmath6 @xmath7 +    the spectrum of the qcd dirac operator , both in the continuum and on the lattice , has several universal properties . by `` universal '' one means `` independent of the details of the dynamics '' ,",
    "e.g. , independent of the precise values of the simulation parameters on the lattice .",
    "such universal features can be described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) . in this contribution , we are concerned with the eigenvalue fluctuations in the bulk of the spectrum on the scale of the local mean level spacing , measured by the distribution @xmath1 of the spacings @xmath8 of adjacent eigenvalues .",
    "we will consider gauge group su(3 ) and staggered fermions which are related to the chiral unitary ensemble of rmt . at zero chemical potential @xmath0 ,",
    "all dirac eigenvalues are purely imaginary , and it has been shown in lattice simulations that @xmath1 agrees with the wigner surmise of rmt , @xmath9 both in the confinement and in the deconfinement phase @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the dirac eigenvalues are strongly correlated , and is indicative of quantum chaos , according to the conjecture by bohigas , giannoni , and schmit @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quantum systems whose classical analogs are integrable obey a poisson distribution , @xmath10 .    here , we focus on nonzero chemical potential . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the lattice dirac matrix generalizes to @xmath12\\\\    & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\hspace*{-59pt }    + \\frac{1}{2a}\\left[u_{\\hat{t}}(x)\\eta_{\\hat{t}}(x)e^{\\mu }      \\delta_{y , x\\!+\\!\\hat{t } }      -u_{\\hat{t}}^{\\dagger}(y)\\eta_{\\hat{t}}(y )      e^{-\\mu}\\delta_{y , x\\!-\\!\\hat{t}}\\right]\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the kawamoto - smit phases @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are complex . in this case",
    ", @xmath1 represents the spacing distribution of nearest neighbors in the complex plane . for each eigenvalue",
    "@xmath14 one has to find the eigenvalue @xmath15 for which @xmath16 is smallest , with a subsequent average over @xmath14 .",
    "this definition assumes that the spectral density is constant over a bounded region in the complex plane ( and zero outside ) .",
    "generally , this is not the case so that an unfolding procedure must be applied , see sec .",
    "however , the spectral density of the so - called ginibre ensemble of rmt , where real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues have the same average size , is constant inside a circle and zero outside , respectively @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath1 is given by @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18    \\sum_{n=1}^{n-1}\\frac{s^{2n}}{n!e_n(s^2)}\\:,\\ ] ] @xmath19 , and @xmath20 + in contrast , the poisson distribution in the complex plane , representing uncorrelated eigenvalues , becomes @xmath21 in the following , we will study the dirac spectrum on the lattice at various values of @xmath22 and compare the resulting @xmath1 with eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "while the quenched approximation at @xmath23 is unphysical @xcite , there is currently no feasible solution to the problem of a complex weight function .",
    "therefore , we generated the gauge field configurations at @xmath24 and added the chemical potential to the dirac matrix afterwards .",
    "the simulations were done with gauge group su(3 ) on a @xmath25 lattice using @xmath26 and @xmath27 flavors of staggered fermions of mass @xmath28 . for each parameter",
    "set , we sampled 50 independent configurations .    the eigenvalue spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for five different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the real parts of the eigenvalues grows with @xmath0 as expected .",
    "while the spectrum is confined to a bounded region in the complex plane , the spectral density is certainly not constant .",
    "therefore , the spectrum has to be unfolded . in one dimension",
    ", unfolding is a local rescaling of the eigenvalue density such that the density on the unfolded scale is equal to unity . to the best of our knowledge , unfolding in the entire complex plane has not been considered yet ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , unfolding was done in strips perpendicular to the real axis ) .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the spectral density has an average and a fluctuating part , @xmath29 .",
    "unfolding means to find a map @xmath30 such that @xmath31 . since the probability has to be invariant , @xmath32 , we find that @xmath33 is the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , @xmath36 choosing @xmath37 yields @xmath38 and , thus , @xmath39 essentially , this is a one - dimensional unfolding in strips parallel to the real axis . for a fixed bin in @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath33 is determined by fitting @xmath41 to a low - order polynomial .",
    "@xmath1 is then constructed from the constant unfolded density as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , normalized such that @xmath42 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    several remarks are in order .",
    "( i ) we have checked spectral ergodicity . if only parts of the spectral support are considered , the results for @xmath1 do not change .",
    "( ii ) if the spectral density has `` holes '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath6 and 2.2 ) , we split the spectral support into several convex pieces and unfold them separately .",
    "this is justified by spectral ergodicity .",
    "( iii ) unfolding each spectrum separately and ensemble unfolding yield the same results for @xmath1 .",
    "( iv ) the results for @xmath1 are stable under variations of the degree of the fit polynomial and of the bin sizes in @xmath43 and @xmath40 .",
    "our results for @xmath1 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for small values of @xmath0",
    ", we probe the regime of `` weak non - hermiticity '' @xcite where the typical size of the real part of the eigenvalues is of the order of the average separation of the imaginary parts , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( our definitions differ from ref .  @xcite by a factor of @xmath44 so that it would be more appropriate to speak of `` weak non - anti - hermiticity '' ) .",
    "some analytical results are known @xcite in this regime , but the spacing distribution is only given as an expansion of @xmath45 for small @xmath8 , where @xmath14 is the location in the complex plane ( i.e. , no unfolding is performed ) .",
    "therefore , we have no closed analytical result to compare with , and presumably it would be very difficult to derive one",
    ". however , something can be said about the small-@xmath8 behavior of @xmath1 . for the ginibre ensemble",
    ", we have @xmath46 for @xmath47 . in the regime of weak non - hermiticity",
    ", it is known that @xmath1 starts with a power smaller than three @xcite .",
    "this is conform with our results for @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where the wigner surmise @xmath48 of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for the corresponding hermitian matrix with @xmath24 is inserted .",
    "increasing @xmath0 , we observe stronger level repulsion leading to quite nice agreement of the data for @xmath5 with the prediction from the ginibre ensemble . for this value of @xmath0",
    ", we are in the regime of `` strong non - hermiticity '' where the ginibre ensemble applies .    for values of @xmath0 larger than 0.7 , the lattice data deviate substantially from the ginibre distribution .",
    "the main question is if our result for @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] should be interpreted as a transition to poisson behavior , or if the agreement of the data at this particular value of @xmath0 with @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is purely accidental",
    ". we have to keep in mind that we neglected @xmath0 in the generation of the equilibrium gauge fields .",
    "therefore , we are not entitled to make any definite statements on possible connections between the finite density phase transition ( expected at smaller values of @xmath0 ) and the observed deviations from ginibre behavior .",
    "nonetheless , these deviations are interesting and deserve further study .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the lattice dirac operator with finite chemical potential .",
    "the data agree with the rmt prediction for the ginibre ensemble for @xmath5 and show deviations for smaller and larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is somewhat different from the situation at @xmath24 where the data agree with the rmt results @xcite .",
