    "quantum mechanics is a theory constructed to deal with isolated systems .",
    "however , it is impossible to completely isolate a system from its surroundings , and usually it relax towards thermal equilibrium with the environment , a phenomenon called dissipation .",
    "otherwise , the environment acts over the system due to its thermal fluctuations , leading to the destruction of pure quantum states in a much shorter time scale ; this phenomenon is called decoherence @xcite .    nowadays , the main theoretical proposal for describing dissipation and decoherence phenomena is to consider the system of interest plus the environment as a closed system and to determine the effective dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "this may be done exactly by projection technics @xcite , and the resulting equation is very useful for an abstract knowledge about the structure of the problem .",
    "however , since the exact equation that governs the dynamics of a quantum system is non markovian and non linear , to obtain its solution is possible only in some very particular cases .",
    "a model which has been very explored in the literature is the linearly coupled oscillators model proposed by a. caldeira and a. j. legget @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the system of interest is a harmonic oscillator and the environment is modeled as huge set of oscillators in thermal equilibrium in a given temperature ; the system - environment interaction is given by a linear coupling in the position of the oscillator of interest .",
    "the caldeira - legget model has been very successful in various areas of physics , particularly in quantum optics . as is well known , despite its quantitative success in the analysis of several experiments @xcite , a sound derivation and understanding of the hypothesis involved in its derivation remain to this day an open question .",
    "the objective of the present contribution is to understand in detail the classical and quantum symplectic structures of a system composed by an oscillator linearly coupled to @xmath1 others without tracing out the @xmath1 states which represent the environment . in particular we show that the exact problem possesses a simple physically transparent geometrical structure . in section 2 ,",
    "we treat the classical oscillators .",
    "the @xmath2 case is analyzed first ; this problem , although very simple , is structurally rich , and clearly exhibits the geometrical nature of the solution : we analyze sections in the phase space which guide us in a sequence of variables transformations ( a squeezing , a rotation and another squeezing ) that give us the system s normal modes .",
    "these transformations encountered for @xmath2 are then used to find analogous transformations for the generic @xmath0 case . in section 3",
    ", we work with the quantum oscillators .",
    "the transformations encountered for the classical case are used there in order to find and analyze the normal modes of the system . throughout this work we use matricial technics which have been very useful to express the algebra involved here in a clear and as short as possible form . in section 4",
    ", we comment on our results and their relations with modern problems .",
