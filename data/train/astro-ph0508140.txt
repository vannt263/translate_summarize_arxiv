    "stars in the mass range 1 - 8 m@xmath3 eventually evolve up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) where they begin to lose mass and form circumstellar shells of dust and gas . during their ascent of the agb",
    ", mass - loss rates are expected to increase with the luminosity of the star , resulting in progressive optical thickening of circumstellar shells .",
    "furthermore , the chemistry of these stars atmospheres , and thus of their circumstellar shells , changes as a result of dredge - up of newly formed carbon from the he - burning shell . due to the extreme ease of formation and stability of co molecules ,",
    "the chemistry in circumstellar shells is controlled by the c / o ratio . if c / o @xmath4 1 all the carbon is trapped in co , leaving oxygen to dominate the chemistry .",
    "conversely , if c / o @xmath5 1 all the oxygen is trapped in co , and carbon dominates the chemistry .",
    "stars start their lives with cosmic c / o ratios ( @xmath60.4 ) , and are thus oxygen - rich . in some agb stars ,",
    "the dredge - up of newly formed carbon is efficient enough to raise the c / o above unity , and these stars are known as carbon stars .",
    "they are expected to have circumstellar shells dominated by amorphous or graphitic carbon grains , although other dust grains are also important ( e.g.   silicon carbide ; sic ) .    as the mass - loss rate increases with the evolution of the agb stars , the dust shells get thicker ( both optically and geometrically ) and these stars eventually become invisible at optical wavelengths and very bright in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "such stars are known as `` extreme carbon stars '' @xcite . at this stage",
    ", intense mass loss depletes the remaining hydrogen in the star s outer envelope , and terminates the agb . up to this point",
    "the star has been making and dredging - up carbon , thus these shells have even more carbon available for dust production than optically bright ( early ) carbon stars ( i.e.  the si / c ratio decreases with the evolution of these stars ) .",
    "the rapid depletion of material from the outer envelope of the star means that this extremely high mass - loss phase must have a relatively short duration ( a few @xmath7 years ; * ? ? ?",
    ".      once the agb star has exhausted its outer envelope , the agb phase ends . during this phase the mass loss virtually stops , and the circumstellar shell begins to drift away from the star . at the same time",
    ", the central star begins to shrink and heat up from 3000 k until it is hot enough to ionize the surrounding gas , at which point the object becomes a planetary nebula ( pn ) . the short - lived post - agb phase , as the star evolves toward to the pn phase , is also known as the proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) phase .",
    "the detached dust shell drifts away from the central star causing a ppn to have cool infrared colors from its cooling dust shell .",
    "meanwhile , the optical depth of the dust shell decreases as it expands allowing the central star to be seen and making such objects optically bright .",
    "the effect of decreasing optical depth and cooling dust temperatures changes the spectrum of the circumstellar envelope , revealing features that were hidden during the agb phase .",
    "circumstellar shells of carbon stars are expected to be dominated by amorphous or graphitic carbon grains .",
    "these dust species do not have diagnostic infrared features and merely contribute to the dust continuum emission .",
    "however , silicon carbide ( sic ) does exhibit a strong infrared feature , which can be exploited when studying carbon stars .    in the context of stardust",
    ", sic has been of great interest since its formation was predicted by condensation models for carbon - rich circumstellar regions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite predicted that sic should re - emit absorbed radiation as a feature in the 1013@xmath1 m region . following these predictions ,",
    "a broad infrared ( ir ) emission feature at @xmath011.4@xmath1 m that is observed in the spectra of many carbon stars has been attributed to solid sic particles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , sic is now believed to be a significant constituent of the dust around carbon stars .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite adopted the name 11+@xmath1 m feature to reflect the variation in observed peak positions in astronomical spectra , this implies that the the features always occur longward of 11@xmath1 m .",
    "we have adopted @xmath011@xmath1 m to reflect the variations in peak positions of this feature .",
    "the effect of the evolution of the density of the dust shell on observed features , and particularly on the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature , have been discussed extensively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "not all these previous works agree .",
    "all studies concur that the increasing optical depth leads to decreasing color temperatures from the stars as the stellar photosphere becomes hidden from view , and the dust from which we receive light becomes progressively cooler . at the same time , the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature tends to become weaker ( relative to the continuum ) and flatter topped ( less sharp peaked ) and possibly broader .",
    "various explanations of this behavior have been proposed , but none are entirely satisfactory .",
    "initially the diminution of the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature was attributed to coating of the grains by amorphous carbon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , meteoritic data does not support this hypothesis ( see   [ meteor ] ) .",
    "moreover , more recent studies of the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature have shown that it is consistent with sic self - absorption , i.e. absorption by cooler sic particles , located in the outer part of the dust shell , where they can absorb the sic emission feature produced by warmer sic closer to the central star ( speck et al .",

    "as the dust shell reaches extreme optical depths , the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature will eventually be seen in net absorption .",
    "however , these absorption features are rare and have mostly been ignored in discussions of evolutionary sequences in carbon star spectra .      silicon carbide is an important presolar grain found in meteorites .",

    "presolar sic was first discovered by @xcite and since then has been the focus of a great deal of laboratory work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the most important findings of this work are : ( 1 ) most of the sic presolar grains were formed around carbon stars ; ( 2 ) nearly all ( @xmath090% ) are of the cubic @xmath9-polytype - sic is the cubic polytype , and is now believed to be the dominant form of sic forming around carbon stars ; see   [ meteor ] , and @xcite ] ; ( 3 ) with one exception , sic grains are never found in the cores of carbon presolar grains ( unlike other carbides - tic , zrc , moc ) ; ( 4 ) the grain - size distribution is large ( 1.5 nm to 26@xmath1 m ) , with most grains in the 0.1  1@xmath1 m range , but with single - crystal grains can exceed 20@xmath1 m in size .",
    "observations of the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature have been compared with laboratory spectra of various forms of sic and after some false starts , has now been attributed to @xmath9-sic , matching the information retrieved from meteoritic samples @xcite .",

    "the @xmath09@xmath1 m feature / wing appears to correlate with optical depth , appearing strongest when the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature is in absorption , but also exists when the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature region weakly emits",
    ". this feature may be due to amorphous sic with excess carbon ( see  [ lab ] ) , in which case , the formation of such grains occurs when the dust shell is denser , further up the agb .",
    "this makes sense , in that the high density shells may form dust grains so fast that the atoms do not have time to migrate to the most energetically favored position before another atom sticks on . in this way we would expect to form amorphous , rather than crystalline grains .",
    "if it is due to nanocrystalline grains , this further supports the hypothesis that grain sizes derease as mass - loss rates increase .",
    "furthermore , early in the life of a carbon star , the dust forming regions will have more si than c for dust formation ( the majority of the c atoms will be locked into co molecules ) .",
    "as the star evolves , and more carbon is dredged up from deep within the star , there will eventually be more c atoms than si atoms and excess c will get trapped in the grains .",
    "the lack of amorphous sic in meteoritic samples may be due to the relative scarcity of this form of sic compared to the crystalline polytypes .",
    "a typical agb star sends dust out into the interstellar medium for a few hundred thousand years , but the extreme carbon star phase is much shorter lived ( @xmath23 years ) and may not occur for all carbon stars ( absorption features are rare )",
    ". therefore we would expect there to be much more crystalline ( mostly @xmath9-sic ) than amorphous sic grains .",
    "furthermore , there may well be a mixture of amorphous and @xmath9-sic forming in the circumstellar shells of very evolved ( extreme ) agb stars .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed peak positions and profile shapes of the 21@xmath1 m feature are remarkably constant @xcite .",
    "this enigmatic feature has been widely discussed since its discovery @xcite and has been attributed to a variety of both transient molecular and long - lived solid - state species , but most of these species have since been discarded as carriers , except for hacs / pahs @xcite and sic @xcite . in the case of sic , it is necessary for the dust grains to be small and contaminated with carbon impurities in order for this feature to appear @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cooling and thinning of the dust shell is essential to the emergence of this feature . during the agb phase ,",
    "the dust is too warm for this feature to appear , but as the dust cools the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature of sic is diminished and the 21@xmath1 m feature is promoted by the underlying dust - continuum emission . in this case",
    "the changing spectrum reflects the change in temperature and optical depth of the dust shell , whereas the spectral features are indicative of the last stage of carbon - rich evolution ( the extreme carbon star phase ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted the change in the appearance of @xmath011@xmath1 m feature from sharp and narrow to broad and flat - topped as possibly an effect of self - absorption .",
    "this was supported by @xcite , who showed that all carbon star spectra in their sample with dust continuum temperatures less than 1200  k needed to have self - absorbed sic in order to be fitted well .",
    "self - absorption exhibits some interesting characteristics that can be used to diagnose the nature of the dust grains that produce observed spectra .",
    "figure  [ modelthick ] shows how the absorption profile changes as particle thickness ( i.e.  grain size ) increases .",
    "this appears to be a violation of beer s law , in that the absorbance is not simply increasing ( for a single wavelength ) with thickness of the particles .",
    "this departure occurs because the measured intensity depends not only on the amount of light that the sample absorbs , but also on the amount reflected at the surface facing the source .",
    "the main peak ( the to mode ) becomes saturated in measured spectra when the actual amount of light transmitted at the to frequency equals the reflectivity .",
    "this point is reached at lower thicknesses ( grain sizes ) for the strong to mode than for the more weakly absorbing shoulder .",
    "violations of beer s law will alter self - absorption in astronomical environments but not emission spectra because the latter are not affected by surface reflections .",
    "therefore , emission spectra of the grains are not so sensitive to the grain size .",
    "as long as the grains are still small compared to the wavelength at which they are observed ( i.e. grains smaller than @xmath24 m for 10@xmath1 m spectra ) , the pure emission feature will appear at the same wavelength ( @xmath25 m ) .",
    "however , once the grains are cool enough and the optical depth high enough , self - absorption of the 11.3@xmath1 m feature will begin and the profile of the feature will depend on the relative sizes of the grains .    in computing the effect of beer s law violations on self - absorption , we assume that the following holds : ( 1 ) the absorbing particles are thicker ( larger ) than the emitting particles , ( 2 ) the light received by the absorbing particles is that of the star = i@xmath26 , i.e. , the inner cloud of emitting particles is rarified enough that it contributes negligible intensity compared to the star , and ( 3 ) that outer dust transmits more light that the inner dust emits ( i.e. starlight is also transmitted ) .",
    "beer s law states that the wavelength - dependent absorbance @xmath27 of a given substance is proportional to the mass absorption coefficient @xmath28 , and the thickness through which the light has to pass @xmath29 :    @xmath30    deviations from beer s law may occur for many reasons .",
    "strictly , beer s law applies to transparent particles ( i.e.  particles which transmit some light at all wavelengths ) and therefore , at high concentrations / opacities may no longer be applicable .",
    "other problems include stray light @xcite .",
    "when measuring absorption , we usually measure the transmittivity @xmath31 of a material and thus obtain the absorptivity @xmath32 :    @xmath33 @xmath34    the light received from a circumstellar shell @xmath35 is given by :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the emission from the inner dust and @xmath38 is the transmission from the outer dust .    from kirchhoff s law ,",
    "the emissivity is the same as the absorptivity , so that @xmath39    therefore ,    @xmath40 @xmath41    where the factor @xmath42 is varied from 0 to 1 as the fraction of light originating from emitting dust increases .",
    "the absorption coefficient will change with grain size @xmath29 , because of the effect of reflections .",
    "@xmath43    essentially , eq .  [ eq1 ] provides the effective transmission of the dust .",
    "if beer s law is followed ( i.e. reflectivity is low and the particles are thin enough to transmit light at all frequencies ) , then @xmath44 and the spectrum received is no different than the intrinsic absorptions . however , if the absorbing particles are larger , and opaque at some frequencies ( i.e.  the to mode ) , the spectrum will be altered .",
    "we have computed the effect of particle thickness on self - absorption in circumstellar shells , and the resulting spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ modelthick ] . for @xmath45 , we used baseline - corrected absorption spectra from the thickest sample of nano @xmath9-sic shown in fig .",
    "[ labthick ] , and for @xmath46 , we similarly used the intermediate sample .",
    "the same results would be obtained for the thinnest sample . as the contribution of the emitting particles increases ,",
    "the contribution of the lo component increases relative to the to component , and the to component appears to shift to longer wavelengths .",
    "if the size and absorption coefficients are identical for both the inner and outer regions of the dust shell , then there will be no shift in the spectral features between emission and absorption .",
    "however , if the outer grains are larger , there will be a shift in the absorption to shorter wavelengths , shown in fig .",
    "[ modelthick ] .    in terms of what we would expect to see in the sequence of carbon star spectra",
    ", the discussion above means that for optically thin dust shells , where we are seeing pure emission , the sic feature should peak at 11.3@xmath1 m and be sharp .",
    "as the optical depth goes up , the sic feature will become self - absorbed , but if the grains in the outer part of the shell are larger than those in the inner zone , the absorption will occur preferentially on the lo side of the feature , diminishing the blue side , which would appear as a shift in the feature to longer wavelengths ( @xmath011.7@xmath1 m ) . as the optical depth gets high enough for the emission feature to be completely absorbed , we no longer see the 11.7@xmath1 m feature and the absorption will peak at a shorter wavelength ( 10.8@xmath1 m ) than the regular sic feature at 11.3@xmath1 m .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ cgs3 ] ) .",
    "this mechanism explains the evolution in the observed sic absorption feature in extreme carbon stars .",
    "furthemore , it correlates with the evolution of the spectral features as seen by @xcite , who showed that as the continuum temperature decreases and the peak - continuum strength of the sic feature diminishes , the peak position tends to move from @xmath011.3@xmath1 m to @xmath011.7@xmath1 m .",
    "this suggests that there is an evolution in the dust grains towards smaller dust grains with higher mass loss .",
    "two separate studies of presolar sic suggest that there is an evolution in grain size that corresponds to the evolution of carbon stars . @xcite",
    "found a correlation between grain size and the concentration of _ s - process _",
    "elements in sic grains taken from the murchison meteorites .",
    "the indarch meteorite presolar sic grains yielded similar results @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the smaller grains have higher relative abundances of _ s - process _ elements . since newly - formed _ s - process _",
    "elements are dredged - up along with carbon from the he - burning shell , they are more abundant in more evolved circumstellar shells than early ones . therefore , these results suggest that the grains formed around carbon stars decrease in size as the stars evolve and support the observations of the self - absorption effects described above .    up until now , the generally accepted wisdom has been that low mass - loss rates early in the agb phase lead to small grains , and increasing mass - loss rates permit the growth of larger grains . in the new scenario , smaller grain sizes with increasing mass loss can be understood in terms of potential nucleation sites . the hardest step in grain formation",
    "is the production of seeds onto which minerals can grow . in a low - density gas",
    "very few seeds can nucleate , leading to the formation of few grains .",
    "however , these few grains can grow large because there are not so many grains competing for the same atoms .",
    "conversely , in a high - density gas , it is easier to form seeds , but so many more nucleate , that there are not enough atoms around for any individual grain to grow large . in this way",
    ", high densities lead to very dense dust shells of small grains .",
    "this effect may be exacerbated by the earlier outflows moving slower than the later outflows .",
    "if the stellar winds that drive the mass loss and send the newly formed grains away from star accelerate with time , then the earlier grains will have more time closer to the star in regions dense enough for grain growth to occur . since radiation - pressure coupling should be related to grain composition , and this will vary with the si / c ratio , we may expect such an effect .",
    "the dust shells around carbon stars and their successors , carbon - rich post - agb stars , evolve along with the star . in early phases ,",
    "the mass - loss rate is low , and hence the dust shell is optically thin . as these stars evolve , the mass - loss rate increases , and thus the dust shell gets more optically thick , until the star is completely obscured in visible light and very bright in the infrared .",
    "during this evolution the relative abundance of silicon to carbon ( si / c ) available for dust formation decreases , so that in the early carbon stars there is more si and c , whereas in the extreme carbon stars there is much more c than si .",
    "once the agb phase ends , the existing dust shell spreads out , becoming optically thin and cooler .",
    "the combination of increasing density and increasing carbon on the agb manifests itself in the nature of the dust grains as seen in the spectral sequence for carbon stars .",
    "early in the carbon star phase , when the mass - loss rate is low and the shell is optically thin , the @xmath011@xmath1 m sic emission feature is strong , narrow and sharp . as the mass loss increases and",
    "the shell becomes optically thicker , the sic feature broadens , flattens and weakens .",
    "finally , once the mass - loss rate is extremely high and the shell is extremely optically thick , the sic feature appears in absorption .",
    "the shifts in the peak of the @xmath011@xmath1 m sic feature are attributable to a combination of optical depth and grain sizes .",
    "the only way to see a shift in the absorption feature to 10.8@xmath1 m is if the absorbing grains are larger than the emitting grains .",
    "therefore , we have observational evidence to suggest that the grains formed in circumstellar shell get smaller as the star evolves .",
    "further evidence for this scenario is seen both in post - agb spectra and in meteoritic studies of presolar grains .",
    "we have presented new mid - ir laboratory spectra for various forms of sic including amorphous sic with excess carbon structure .",
    "these data corroborate and augment the laboratory work of @xcite and @xcite , indicating that solid solutions of c replacing si in sic have the diamond structure on a local scale .",
    "this is a good candidate for the carrier of the @xmath2 m feature seen in both emission and absorption , and correlated with trends in the @xmath011@xmath1 m feature .",
    "we are extremely grateful to the reviewer whose comments significantly improved the paper .",
    "we would also like to thank kevin volk for providing us with his iso sws spectra and model fits for extreme carbon stars .",
