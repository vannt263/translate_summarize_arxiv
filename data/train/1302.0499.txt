    "( [ pmpf ] ) .",
    "note that ( i ) although the electron - phonon drag is proportional to a high power of temperature , see eq .",
    "( [ pmp2 ] ) , the final result for the sse coefficient is only weakly temperature dependent , @xmath156 .",
    "it comes out as a result of the strong dispersion of the phonon scattering time in the substrate .",
    "although function @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) is also temperature dependent , this dependence comes only from the non - locality of the phonon collision integral in energy , and is relatively weak .",
    "another important property of this function is that ( ii ) it s spatial dependence varies with temperature rather slowly .",
    "this is because the phonons which contribute mostly to the non - local effect have inelastic scattering length of the order of the sample size .",
    "varying the temperature mainly results in the shift of the relevant phonon energy @xmath157 , so that the corresponding length scale @xmath158 remains the same . _ the observations ( i ) , ( ii ) stress the importance of the strong dispersion of the phonon scattering .",

    "in this work we have discussed the main ingredients of the phonon dynamics in the substrate that allows to understand the spatial profile of the sse signal . as we have shown , to explain the non - local effect , _",
    "i.e. _ its dependence on the position of the probe along the substrate , one must consider the spectral non - uniformity of the phonon distribution function which can be interpreted as spectrally non - uniform temperature .",
    "a key aspect of the non - locality is the explicit introduction of the boundaries into the equations describing the propagation of diffusing phonons .",
    "in addition , we have presented a scheme of the non - magnon mechanism in the case when the ferromagnetic element of the device is conducting@xcite and obtain the correct magnitude of the effect .",
    "furthermore , the spatial profile of the sse signal , presented in fig . [ fig_dt ] , is very similar to the one shown as a universal profile on the fig .",
    "2f of the ref .",
    "although the phonon kinetics at temperatures comparable with @xmath164 is strongly modified by umklapp processes , the measured proportionality between the sse signal and the magnitude of the magnetization in ref",
    ". clearly indicates that near @xmath165 k the effect is still dominated by the flux of the spin - polarized electrons , instead of the magnon - mediated spin torque .",
    "we believe that the difference between the data presented in figs 2 and 3 of ref . - in particular , the difference in the behavior near the @xmath166 - supports this picture .",
    "two different samples demonstrate drastically different temperature behavior .",
    "the sample which is thicker and grown on a substrate of a better quality has larger peak value of both @xmath129 and thermopower @xmath167 and also much faster decay of @xmath129 at approaching @xmath168 .",
    "the stronger thermopower observed in the thicker sample demonstrates that in this sample phonons lose momentum mainly in collisions with electrons , while in the thinner sample , their scattering on the defects is more efficient .",
    "however , due to strong sensitivity of the phonon distribution function at the f - pt boundary to the ratio @xmath169 , in the thicker sample the sse decays with temperature much faster than in the thinner one . as we have already discussed , at large @xmath169 the phonons equilibrate before they reach the probe .",
    "indeed , in the thicker sample ( more than three times thicker than the thinner one ) the effect was not even resolved near the curie temperature within the accuracy of the measurement .",
