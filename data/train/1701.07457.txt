    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are bright , millisecond - duration events occurring in the radio sky .",
    "their origin is still unknown .",
    "eighteen frbs have been detected within the past decade ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with only one source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) known to repeat .",
    "a catalog of these bursts and their properties is made available by @xcite .",
    "these transient events can be distinguished from pulsars and rotating radio transients ( rrats ) on the basis of their dispersion measure ( dm ) , which is a measure of the integrated free electron density along the line of sight in the intervening medium .",
    "the bursts have dms that are 1.4 to 35 times the maximum predicted along the line of sight by the ne2001 model of electron density in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the excess dm of frbs can arise from the intergalactic medium , the host galaxy of the frb progenitor , or possibly from a high electron density , compact structure in our galaxy .",
    "the interferometric localization of bursts from the repeating frb121102 provides evidence of its association with an optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up by @xcite confirms the optical counterpart as being the host galaxy of the frb and characterizes it as a low - metallicity , star - forming dwarf galaxy located at a redshift of @xmath10 = 0.19273(8 ) .",
    "the observations of @xcite also support an extragalactic origin with scattering and scintillation in frb110523 suggesting that the majority of the scattering originates from within the typical size scale of a galaxy .",
    "these observations lend support to models with extragalactic progenitors of frbs such as giant pulses from extragalactic neutron stars @xcite and magnetar giant flares ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interferometric localizations of more frbs are essential to conclusively determine the source of the excess dm and the nature of the frb progenitors for the broader frb population .",
    "all but one known frb @xcite has been detected at frequencies greater than 1 ghz .",
    "detection or stringent limits at lower frequencies are crucial for understanding properties of frbs such as their spectral index and pulse profile evolution with frequency .",
    "searches at low frequencies with telescopes such as lofar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , arecibo @xcite and mwa ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have so far not resulted in any detections .",
    "@xcite report an upper limit on the frb rate at 327 mhz of 10@xmath11 frbs sky@xmath2 day@xmath2 for a flux density threshold of 83 mjy and pulse width of 10 ms . a non - detection with the lofar pilot pulsar survey at 142 mhz allowed @xcite to place an upper limit of 150 frbs sky@xmath2 day@xmath2 , for bursts brighter than 107 jy at burst duration 0.66 ms .",
    "@xcite report an upper limit of 29 frbs sky@xmath2 day@xmath2 for bursts with flux density above 62 jy at 145 mhz and a pulse width of 5 ms , based on observations with the uk station of the lofar radio telescope .",
    "the upper limits on the frb rate reported thus far from these low - frequency radio surveys are not particularly constraining because of limitations in total observing time and volume searched . with observations to date amounting to a total on - sky time of 84 days , the green bank northern celestial cap ( gbncc ) pulsar survey @xcite can provide the strongest constraints yet on the frb rate and spectral index in the frequency range of 300400 mhz .",
    "the gbncc survey is also important for predicting the frb yield of upcoming low - frequency telescopes such as the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ( chime ) . with its large field of view and good sensitivity ,",
    "chime is predicted to discover tens of frbs per day ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in its frequency range of 400800 mhz .",
    "the gbncc survey is thus well placed to determine the expected detection rate for the lower part of the chime band .    in this paper",
    ", we present results from the search for frbs in gbncc survey pointings observed through may 2016 . for the purpose of our search and subsequent analysis",
    ", we define an frb as an astrophysical pulse with a dm greater than twice the maximum line - of - sight galactic dm .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite of a possibly galactic origin of the excess dm of the only frb with a dm ratio @xmath12 2 , frb010621 @xcite , lends support to our choice of a dm ratio of 2 for the frb definition .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : obser ] , we give a description of the survey and its sensitivity .",
    "we describe the data analysis pipeline in section [ sec : analysis ] and place constraints on the frb rate in section [ sec : rate ] . in section [ sec : spectra ] , we constrain the mean spectral index of frbs by performing monte - carlo simulations of a population of frbs .",
    "we discuss the implications for current and upcoming surveys in section [ sec : implication ] and present our summary and conclusions in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "and those in blue have been searched to a dm of 3000 pc @xmath0 . ]    the green bank northern celestial cap ( gbncc ) pulsar survey @xcite began in 2009 with the aim to search for pulsars and rrats , particularly millisecond pulsars suitable for inclusion in the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves ( nanograv ) pulsar timing array .",
    "the search is conducted using the 100-m diameter robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) at a frequency of 350 mhz .",
    "data spanning 100 mhz of bandwidth split into 4096 frequency channels are recorded with the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ) .",
    "each pointing on the sky is observed for 120 s and sampled with a 81.92-@xmath13s time resolution .",
    "the entire sky visible to the gbt ( @xmath14 ) has been divided into @xmath15125000 pointings , around 75000 of which have been observed through may 2016 . in the initial days of the survey",
    ", data were searched to a maximum dm of 500 pc @xmath0 . motivated by the discovery of frbs , the maximum dm for the search was increased to 3000 pc @xmath0 . however , the initial pointings are yet to be reprocessed with this updated parameter .",
    "a total of 71% of the pointings were searched to a dm of 3000 pc @xmath0 and 29% of the pointings were searched to a dm of 500 pc @xmath0 .",
    "the search in dm space is conducted by stepping over a range of trial dms with @xmath16 being the step size between consecutive trials .",
    "the dm step sizes used by the search pipeline for the gbncc survey are mentioned in the caption to figure [ fig : smin ] .",
    "not all pointings observed by the gbncc survey were examined during the analysis reported on here .",
    "pointings searched to a dm of 500 pc @xmath0 for which the maximum line - of - sight galactic dm predicted by the ne2001 model @xcite was greater than 100 pc @xmath0 were not inspected .",
    "this is because our adopted definition of an frb implies that these 7000 pointings searched over an extremely small range of extragalactic dms as compared to the rest of the pointings .",
    "removal of an additional 3000 pointings that were rendered unusable by the presence of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) limited the total observing time for the frb search to 84 days .",
    "the time corresponding to an estimated masking fraction of 2% for all pointings has been subtracted from the total time on sky reported here .    figure [ fig : skymap ] shows the gbncc pointings included in our frb search overlaid on the sky map of the maximum galactic dm predicted by the ne2001 model @xcite .",
    "the temporal distribution of the pointings is shown in figure [ fig : time ] .",
    "the minimum detectable flux density @xmath17 for frbs searched with the gbncc survey can be calculated using the expression derived by @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a factor accounting for digitization losses , @xmath20 is the minimum detectable signal - to - noise ratio of the broadened pulse , @xmath21 is the receiver temperature , @xmath22 is the sky temperature , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the intrinsic and broadened pulse widths , respectively , @xmath25 is the telescope gain , @xmath26 is the number of polarizations summed and @xmath27 is the bandwidth .",
    "values of the above - mentioned parameters for the gbncc survey are listed in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "we use @xmath27 = 75 mhz instead of the recorded bandwidth of 100 mhz to account for roll - off at the bandpass edges and for the estimated masking fraction of 5% in the frequency domain . the average sky temperature at 350 mhz , @xmath28 , along the line of sight for all the pointings included in the frb search has been estimated using the 408 mhz all - sky map @xcite and a spectral index of @xmath292.6 for galactic emission .",
    "the broadened pulse width @xmath24 accounts for both instrumental and propagation effects , and is computed from the quadrature sum as follows : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the sampling time and @xmath32 is the scattering time arising from multi - path propagation of signals caused by an ionized medium .",
    "the dispersive delay within each frequency channel , @xmath33 , is calculated ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath4 is the central observing frequency and @xmath35 is the channel bandwidth .    for an intrinsic pulse width @xmath36",
    "ms , scattering time @xmath37 ms and a dm of 756 pc @xmath0 ( mean dm of known frbs ; @xcite ) , the minimum detectable flux density for the gbncc survey is 0.63 jy . the minimum detectable flux density is plotted as a function of intrinsic pulse width and scattering time , for different dm step sizes , in figure [ fig : smin ] .",
    "the minimum detectable s / n , used for the calculation of the minimum detectable flux density , is also dependent on the intrinsic pulse width , scattering timescale and dm step size .",
    "the dependence of the s / n on these variables is part of the code used to search and rank frb candidates , rrattrap ( described in section [ sec : rrat ] ) .",
    "the rationale for this dependence is detailed in section [ sec : rratsn ] .",
    "the analysis pipeline , based on the presto software package @xcite , is run on the guillimin high performance computing ( hpc ) cluster operated at mcgill university by clumeq & compute canada .",
    "the first step of processing involves searching for and masking time samples and frequency channels containing rfi .",
    "the effect of dispersion is then corrected for by dedispersing the data at a large number of trial dms up to a maximum of 500 pc cm @xmath38 or 3000 pc @xmath0 .",
    "the dedispersed and downsampled time series for each trial dm is subsequently searched for single pulses using a matched filtering algorithm which convolves the time series with box cars having widths ranging from 81.92 @xmath13s to 100 ms . all single pulse events with s / n greater than 5 are stored for further processing . the above - mentioned analysis has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the single - pulse output is processed by a grouping and rating algorithm rrattrap which has aided in the discovery of 10 rrats in gbncc survey data @xcite .",
    "the large number of dm trials ensure that each pulse ( astrophysical or rfi ) is detected as multiple single pulse events that are closely spaced in dm and time .",
    "rrattrap groups all such events and ranks the groups based on how closely they match the behavior of an astrophysical pulse .",
    "it then produces colorized dm versus time plots for several dm ranges with groups of different ranks plotted in different colors .",
    "a group of fewer than 30 single pulse events occurring within a fixed dm and time threshold is classified as noise and not processed further .",
    "a considerable fraction of the single pulse events in our pointings fall in this category .",
    "strong narrow - band rfi is another major source of single pulse events .",
    "the algorithm deals with these signals , that we know have a terrestrial origin , by assigning a low rank to groups with the s / n peaking at a dm @xmath12 2 pc @xmath0 .",
    "a low rank is also assigned to a group corresponding to a narrow - band signal , identified by it being detected with a constant s / n over a large range of dms .",
    "a bright , broadband signal from an astrophysical source will be detected with the maximum s / n at an optimal dm and with lower s / n at closely spaced trial dms above or below the optimal dm due to dispersive smearing . groups exhibiting this characteristic of astrophysical pulses are ranked highly .",
    "rrattrap exhibits a significant variation in sensitivity with pulse width due to our requirement of a minimum of 30 single pulse events for a group to be ranked .",
    "sensitivity to extremely narrow pulses is reduced since dispersive smearing prevents the detection of the pulse at 30 dm trials .",
    "the reduction in the sensitivity is maximum at high dms where the dm step size increases to 0.5 pc @xmath0 .    in order to determine whether a pulse will be ranked by rrattrap",
    ", we first obtain the peak flux @xmath9 corresponding to the s / n of the pulse at the optimal dm ( s / n@xmath39 ) , using equation [ eq : smin ] . the reduction in the peak flux @xmath9 of the pulse due to dedispersion at an incorrect trial dm",
    "is modelled by the following equation derived by @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 here @xmath42 ghz is the center frequency of the gbncc survey and @xmath43 is the reduced flux measured at a trial dm differing from the optimal dm by @xmath44 .",
    "the width of the pulse dedispersed at an incorrect trial dm is given by @xmath45 since dispersive smearing conserves pulse area @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "a single pulse event at a trial dm , with a dm error of @xmath44 , will therefore be detected with a s / n which can be determined by substituting the reduced flux @xmath43 , the intrinsic pulse width @xmath47 and other parameters of the gbncc survey in equation [ eq : smin ] .    for a given pulse width",
    ", we can thus obtain the minimum value of the peak s / n that will allow detection of 30 single pulse events with a s / n @xmath48 .",
    "the minimum detectable peak s / n is plotted as a function of intrinsic pulse width and scattering time , for different dm step sizes , in figure [ fig : svary ] .",
    "the s / n used to calculate the threshold flux density of the gbncc survey is set to be the minimum value of the peak s / n evaluated using the above - mentioned method or 10 , whichever is greater .",
    "this is done to account for the fact that only pointings having a frb candidate with a s / n @xmath49 were visually inspected ( see section [ sec : visual ] ) .",

    "a total of 72% of the pointings had at least one single pulse with a s / n @xmath54 .",
    "these 44000 pointings were processed with the modified version of rrattrap to group and rank single pulse events at a dm greater than twice the maximum line - of - sight galactic dm , dm@xmath55 .",
    "there is a 10% chance that an astrophysical pulse will not be ranked highly by rrattrap @xcite . to ensure no effect of this false negative rate on our search , we did not apply rrattrap ranks as a criteria for visual inspection and inspected plots ( corresponding to dm ranges for which dm @xmath56 2dm@xmath55 ) for all 44000 pointings , regardless of the ranks of the groups they contained .",

    "<S> we report on a search for fast radio bursts ( frbs ) with the green bank northern celestial cap ( gbncc ) pulsar survey at 350 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> pointings amounting to a total on - sky time of 61 days were searched to a dm of 3000 pc @xmath0 while the rest ( 23 days ; 29% of the total time ) were searched to a dm of 500 pc @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> no frbs were detected in the pointings observed through may 2016 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a 95% confidence upper limit on the frb rate of 3.6@xmath1 frbs sky@xmath2 day@xmath2 above a peak flux density of 0.63 jy at 350 mhz for an intrinsic pulse width of 5 ms . </S>",
    "<S> we place constraints on the spectral index @xmath3 ( flux density at a frequency @xmath4 , @xmath5 by running monte carlo simulations for different astrophysical scenarios and cumulative flux density distributions of the frb population . </S>",
    "<S> the non - detection with gbncc is consistent with the 1.4-ghz rate estimate reported for the parkes surveys for @xmath6 in the absence of scattering and free - free absorption and @xmath7 in the presence of scattering , for a euclidean flux distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints imply that frbs must exhibit either a flat spectrum or a spectral turnover at frequencies above 400 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints also allow us to estimate the number of bursts that can be detected with current and upcoming surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ( chime ) may detect as many as 54 frbs a day , making it well suited to obtain interesting constraints on spectral index , slope of the log @xmath8-log @xmath9 function and pulse profile evolution across its bandwidth ( 400800 mhz ) .  </S>"
