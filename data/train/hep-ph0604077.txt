    "the search for the higgs boson is a main objective of the lhc physics program .",
    "the atlas and cms detectors are designed to detect a higgs boson in the mass range from about 100 gev up to at least 600 gev . during the last 15 years , many higgs boson signatures have been studied . for a detailed description of this effort",
    "we refer the reader to refs .  @xcite .",
    "if atlas and cms function as designed , a discovery of a standard model higgs boson over the entire mass range can be expected with luminosities of about 30 fb@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to study how well the mass , width , and couplings of a particle with the properties of a higgs boson can be measured at the lhc , and how well these measurements can discriminate between the standard model and its viable extensions .",
    "the potential statistical accuracy for such measurements is usually assessed by computing experimental efficiencies using leading order ( lo ) parton shower monte carlo generators .",
    "however , these efficiency estimates can not be expected to be accurate , especially in complicated signatures such as @xmath4 .",
    "it has been found that corrections beyond lo are particularly significant for higgs boson production in the channel @xmath5 .",
    "the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections  @xcite increase the cross - section by a factor of about 1.7 - 2 as compared to the lo result .",
    "a few years ago , the inclusive cross - section was computed in the large @xmath6 limit with nnlo accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the new corrections increase the nlo cross - section by another @xmath7 .",
    "very recently , some threshold - enhanced @xmath8 terms were also computed  @xcite , changing the nnlo result by less than @xmath9 .",
    "these computations show that the higgs boson cross - section can be reliably estimated only after many orders in perturbation theory have been considered .",
    "it is therefore necessary to account for higher order corrections in a realistic analysis of the higgs boson signal .",
    "recently , a program fehip that describes higgs boson production in gluon fusion was developed  @xcite .",
    "fehip computes the cross - section and fully differential distributions for higgs boson production at nnlo in qcd .",
    "arbitrary cuts can be imposed on partonic jets and on the decay products of the higgs boson .",
    "fehip does not have an implementation of a parton shower and a hadronization algorithm .",
    "this creates a few shortcomings , since it is not possible to apply cuts at the hadron level or to generate events for a detector simulation .",
    "in addition , regions of phase - space close to kinematic boundaries can not be described reliably in fixed - order calculations .",
    "this feature manifests itself in large perturbative corrections at special kinematic regions , such as the low higgs @xmath10 region .    to overcome these characteristic problems of fixed order perturbative computations ,",
    "the resummation of soft gluon effects to all orders in perturbation theory must be performed .",
    "this resummation may be obtained using analytical techniques  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , these effects are also included in parton shower monte carlo programs .",
    "novel approaches  @xcite merge cross - sections computed in fixed order perturbation theory with these lo event generators , such as pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite .",
    "very significant progress has been achieved , and the pioneering monte - carlo event generator mc@nlo  @xcite combines consistently nlo perturbative calculations with herwig for a number of processes at hadron colliders .",
    "unfortunately , no method exists which merges parton shower algorithms with nnlo partonic cross - sections consistently .",
    "this is desirable for processes with large perturbative corrections .",
    "it is possible to incorporate nnlo corrections into realistic analyses of experimental signatures in an approximate way by multiplying probabilities of events in a parton shower monte carlo simulation by so - called @xmath11-factors .",
    "these factors force the monte carlo output to agree with certain observables computed in perturbative qcd .",
    "this technique is called event reweighting .",
    "the simplest version of this technique is a multiplication of the monte carlo output by a constant factor so that the total cross - sections computed perturbatively and with the reweighted monte - carlo simulation agree .",
    "re - scaling monte carlo output by a constant factor does not guarantee an agreement between perturbative and monte carlo results for differential distributions , since perturbative corrections do depend on kinematic variables and vary across the phase - space .",
    "a better job may be done if the monte carlo output and the perturbative calculation are matched at the differential level  @xcite .",
    "a point - by - point reweighting of the monte - carlo throughout the available phase - space is not possible , since infrared divergences would produce divergent weights .",
    "we must instead select a realistic set of observables to match , and then check if the reweighted simulation gives a reliable prediction for other observables .",
    "in this paper we study the reweighting procedure for higgs boson production in the gluon fusion channel at the lhc .",
    "we match the monte - carlo output of both pythia and mc@nlo to distributions that depend only on the higgs boson kinematics , which is a simple and obvious way of reweighting the monte carlo output .",
    "we match to a double differential distribution in the higgs boson transverse momentum and rapidity .",
    "this distribution is chosen both for its simplicity and because it allows us to decouple the higgs boson decay chain from the higgs boson production . however , the kinematics of accompanying qcd radiation is totally ignored in the reweighting process .",
    "this ignorance is not a problem if hadronic radiation is treated fairly inclusively by cuts applied to a process of interest ; however , if a detailed description of the hadronic radiation becomes relevant , the reweighting procedure may lead to inaccurate results .",
    "a particular example of a situation when this happens is the jet veto on transverse momenta of hadronic jets ; we discuss it in detail in section  [ sec : fehip ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fehip ] we introduce the reweighting procedure and discuss in detail differential distributions in the reaction @xmath12 .",
    "we first study the reweighting procedure at nlo by comparing the fixed order result with pythia and mc@nlo .",
    "we present an example in which the reweighting procedure fails to produce accurate acceptances : when a jet veto is imposed on the transverse momenta of extra qcd radiation .",
    "we explain how this problem is ameliorated at nnlo .",
    "we then apply the reweighting approach to estimate the nnlo effects for the channels @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we first reweight pythia and mc@nlo events in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "we compute the accepted cross - section and differential distributions which have a potential discriminating power from the di - photon irreducible background  @xcite : the average @xmath15 transverse momentum distribution and the pseudorapidity difference @xmath16 of the two photons .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between the reweighted pythia and mc@nlo events for all observables .",
    "the di - photon channel is a testing ground for the reweighting procedure , since we can compare the results with the nnlo predictions of fehip for the same observables .",
    "we find that accepted cross - sections agree better than @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath19 distributions also agree very well away from kinematic thresholds . near these boundaries , they reproduce the correct resummed behavior of the parton - shower monte carlo simulations .    we next study the @xmath20 channel .",
    "@xcite already employed a reweighting technique in order to study the effect of perturbative corrections in this channel by matching the pythia output to the resummed @xmath21 spectrum of the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "an optimal set of cuts for isolating a higgs signal in this channel was introduced and studied in  @xcite .",
    "a study of this channel with higher - order qcd corrections included was presented in  @xcite , where both the signal and @xmath22 background were included using a reweighting technique . the analysis in section",
    "[ sec : fehip ] of the accuracy achievable by reweighting pythia for processes with a jet veto cut implies that at least _ shapes _ of distributions can be predicted reliably .",
    "hence , we calculate various lepton distributions in the reaction @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , the reweighting turns out to be largely irrelevant for these distributions and the prediction of reweighted pythia and standard pythia agree very well .",
    "the cross - sections computed with generator @xmath25 for the process @xmath26 are @xmath27 where we sum over all final - state multiplicities @xmath28 , and integrate the events @xmath29 over the phase - space variables @xmath30 of all @xmath31 particles in the final state .",
    "the function @xmath32 selects the kinematic configurations to be accepted in the measured cross - section .",
    "the events depend implicitly on the renormalization and various factorization scales .",
    "the simplest observable is the total cross - section @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that standard event generators fail to predict total cross - sections reliably . as an example we set the mass of the higgs boson to @xmath35 , and the renormalization and factorization scales to @xmath36 .",
    "we use the generators pythia version 6.325 with a @xmath37 ordered parton shower and mc@nlo version 3.2 for pythia we use the mrst2001 lo set of parton - distribution functions , while for mc@nlo we use the corresponding nlo set . in mc@nlo , the scale choice @xmath36",
    "is also used , instead of the default setting .",
    "the resulting pythia and mc@nlo cross - sections are @xmath38 the corresponding fixed - order nnlo cross - section is @xmath39 the large differences between the pythia , mc@nlo and nnlo cross - sections reflect the fact that the nlo and nnlo perturbative corrections are very significant .    a consistent method for merging fixed - order perturbative calculations and parton - shower algorithms is only formulated at nlo in perturbation theory , and is implemented in mc@nlo .",
    "a similar procedure beyond nlo is not yet available .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to incorporate the large perturbative corrections into the event generators . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a pragmatic approach to solve this problem .",
    "we multiply the integrand in eq.([eq : eg_xsection ] ) with a function @xmath40 , @xmath41 in order to reweight the events @xmath29 , @xmath42 the reweighting factors @xmath40 model the effect of higher order corrections through a certain order in perturbation theory .",
    "we determine the factors @xmath40 by requiring that eq.([eq : reg_xsection ] ) reproduces the fixed - order perturbative results for selected distributions , @xmath43 we emphasize that eq.([eq : reg_xsection ] ) is an approximate ansatz to describe effects of higher order corrections in the absence of a rigorous treatment .",
    "strictly speaking , higher order corrections do depend on parton multiplicities .",
    "for example , @xmath44 is renormalized differently compared to , @xmath45 .",
    "this feature is ignored in eq.([eq : reg_xsection ] ) , where the reweighting factors @xmath46 do not depend on the multiplicities @xmath28 .",
    "a more detailed version of reweighting would not be universal , because matrix elements with fixed multiplicities of partons are divergent in perturbation theory .",
    "independent renormalization of events with different multiplicities has to depend on a globally - defined set of cuts , e.g. the jet finding algorithm .",
    "this invalidates the unweightedness of events , the single most important feature of parton shower monte carlo event generators .",
    "we will see the errors in the reweighting procedure caused by neglecting the dependence on parton multiplicities later in this section , when we compare reweighted pythia at nlo with mc@nlo .",
    "having pointed out the approximate nature of the reweighting procedure , we discuss a choice of a suitable distribution for which the agreement of a monte carlo generator and the perturbative calculation can be imposed . since , as we discussed in the previous paragraph , the reweighting ansatz is unsuitable for resolving the structure of qcd radiation , we use the kinematic variables which describe the higgs boson .",
    "since , up to an angle in a plane transverse to the collision axis , the higgs boson kinematics is determined by its transverse momentum @xmath10 and rapidity @xmath47 , we normalize the events @xmath29 to the magnitudes and shapes of the nnlo bin - integrated double differential distributions in @xmath47 and @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that such a normalization renders the events more realistic in predicting other observables of the process . without a technique for combining nnlo results with parton showering in the spirit of mc@nlo ,",
    "this is the best way we have of combining these calculations with event generators .",
    "note that we are not changing the properties of the radiation produced by the monte carlo generators .",
    "we are only changing the normalization of these events to reproduce certain distributions .",
    "the reweighted generators therefore do not better describe events with multiple hard radiations .",

    "the values of the bin boundaries @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chosen in such a way that they capture the shape of the higgs @xmath10 and rapidity distributions and span the allowed kinematic range for @xmath47 and @xmath10 . in what follows we always set the renormalization and factorization scales to @xmath36 , since this choice is known to yield a perturbative series with faster convergence  @xcite .",
    "we point out that at nlo the @xmath10 and @xmath47 variables completely constrain the kinematics of the process @xmath24 . at nnlo ,",
    "new tree level processes @xmath54 with two partons in the final state require additional phase - space variables in order to determine the kinematics of partonic radiation .",
    "our reweighting functions @xmath40 are independent of these additional variables .",
    "this may create a problem in case there are important cuts on the hadronic radiation .",
    "the choice of the bin boundaries in @xmath10 of the higgs boson is a subtle issue .",
    "some of the standard cuts that we need to apply in higgs boson production processes have a strong dependence on the @xmath10 of the higgs boson .",
    "for example , in the @xmath55 decay channel it is important to have a phenomenologically realistic model for the low and intermediate @xmath10 region since after cuts most of the signal comes from the region of low higgs @xmath10 .",
    "the higgs @xmath10 distribution in this region is not correctly described in fixed - order calculations .",
    "logarithms of the form @xmath56 become large and require a resummation .",
    "nevertheless , fixed order calculations for cross - sections integrated over @xmath10 of the higgs boson are still viable , provided that the integration region is sufficiently broad .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bin0a ] we show the @xmath10 distributions for the fixed - order nnlo calculation , pythia and mc@nlo .",

    "therefore , for @xmath59 , we reweight all events with a uniform factor , maintaining the shape of the @xmath10 distribution provided by the generator @xmath51 .",

    "it is worth investigating if just a single , constant @xmath11-factor is sufficient for accurate reweighting .",

    "what is occurring here is that this observable is very sensitive to the properties of the qcd radiation .",
    "multiple partonic emissions are required to generate the correct jet @xmath75 spectrum , and the nlo result contains only a single partonic emission .",
    "the @xmath75 spectrum of this additional parton is generated for the first time at nlo , and is therefore not accurately predicted at this order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "we note that reweighting pythia to the nlo result spoils the agreement between its acceptance and that computed with mc@nlo .    to check that multiple emissions are indeed important , we present below the jet multiplicites for both pythia and mc@nlo before a jet veto is imposed .",
    "we study the cross - section both inclusively and with the restriction @xmath76 gev , to show that multiple emissions are required to obtain correctly even the high @xmath75 events .",

    "the @xmath111 dependent effective @xmath11-factor is 10% lower than the fully inclusive @xmath11-factor of 2.28 , while the @xmath11-factor coming from only reweighting to the @xmath75 distribution is 13% lower than the inclusive @xmath11-factor , comparable with the results from  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the rapidity dependence is therefore less than 3% .",
    "we now employ r(pythia ) to study distribution shapes in @xmath112 .",
    "we normalize each result to the integrated cross - section subject to the appropriate cuts . since the distributions studied do not probe the hadronic radiation , we expect them to be very well described by r(pythia ) .    in fig",
    "[ fig : ptlepton ] we plot the minimum and maximum transverse momentum distributions of the detected leptons for pythia and r(pythia ) events .",
    "these distributions are characteristic of the higgs signal and can be used to discriminate from the background .",
    "we observe that the reweighting does not change the shape of distributions .",
    "an application of a constant @xmath11-factor would lead to the same results .",
    "however , the appropriate @xmath11-factor is the effective one of 2.098 discussed at the beginning of this section , which is 10% lower than the fully inclusive @xmath11-factor .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a phenomenological approach to including nnlo corrections in event generators such as pythia or mc@nlo . without an extension of the mc@nlo procedure to nnlo , this offers the best way of combining parton showering and hadronization with nnlo calculations .",
    "we study this procedure for higgs boson production at the lhc , since the fully differential nnlo calculation is available in the program fehip .",
    "we reweight the monte - carlo events of pythia and mc@nlo to match the bin - integrated nnlo double differential distribution in the higgs @xmath10 and rapidity .",
    "we then study how well distributions of the higgs boson decay products are predicted by this reweighting procedure .",
    "we note that the @xmath11-factors that describe the reweighting of both pythia and mc@nlo exhibit significant kinematic dependences , so that the use of a single constant @xmath11-factor may not be adequate .",
    "we first study the reweighting procedure for the process @xmath26 , without decays of the higgs boson .",
    "the @xmath11-factors that describe the reweighting of both pythia and mc@nlo depend significantly on the higgs boson transverse momentum , and non - negligibly on its rapidity .",
    "we test how well reweighting reproduces a fully consistent merging of fixed - order calculations with parton showering by reweighting pythia at nlo and comparing to mc@nlo .",
    "we find large discrepancies when a jet veto is imposed .",
    "this indicates that the single parton emission present in the nlo calculation is insufficient to correctly describe cuts where the hadronic structure is probed .",
    "the reweighting in the presence of a jet veto works much better at nnlo , where two partonic emissions are present in the final state .",
    "this indicates the importance of extending perturbative calculations to nnlo in order to obtain a reasonable description of the additional radiation .",
    "we then examine the decay channel @xmath113 with all relevant experimental cuts included .",
    "we find that both the reweighted pythia and the reweighted mc@nlo match very well the accepted cross - section as predicted by fehip .",
    "we next study distributions that have been proposed to discriminate between the higgs signal and the background . both r(pythia ) and r(mc@nlo )",
    "describe the kinematic distributions well .",
    "they match the nnlo fixed - order result away from kinematic features , and exhibit the resummation present in the event generators near the kinematic boundaries .",
    "we proceed to study the decay channel @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to understand distributions in this channel at the lhc , since a direct reconstruction of the higgs boson mass peak is not possible because of the two neutrinos in the final state .",
    "we can not yet directly compare lepton distributions with the nnlo result , since fehip does not yet contain the decay @xmath114 .",
    "we study lepton and missing energy distributions using r(pythia ) , assuming that it predicts the distribution shapes correctly .",
    "since herwig does not yet contain spin correlations for this channel we do not present results for r(mc@nlo ) .",
    "we find that the reweighting induces very small kinematic shifts .",
    "we study the effective @xmath11-factor for this channel after all cuts have been applied , and find that it is 10% smaller than the inclusive @xmath11-factor .",
    "the effect of the rapidity dependence on this effective @xmath11-factor is small , about 3% .    in summary , in this paper",
    "we study for the first time the detection efficiency for the higgs boson at the lhc by reweighting parton shower monte carlo output to the fully differential higgs boson cross section at nnlo in qcd .",
    "monte carlo events from pythia and mc@nlo are normalized to the nnlo calculation of the higgs boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions . for higgs boson events with low @xmath75 ,",
    "a constant @xmath11-factor is applied , to maintain the resummed shape present in the monte carlo simulations . for the @xmath110 channel , where a jet veto is applied",
    ", we find a small difference of 3% compared to a similar reweighting approach using only the transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "we conclude that the effect of the nnlo higgs boson rapidity dependence on lhc observables is now accurate to the percent level .",
    "the dominant remaining theoretical uncertainties affecting the higgs boson search at the lhc are : ( 1 ) the scale uncertainty arising from truncation of the perturbative expansion at nnlo ; ( 2 ) the modeling of the low @xmath75 higgs spectrum ; ( 3 ) the theoretical uncertainties for the backgrounds to the higgs signal .",
    "we believe that the event reweighting studied here is a useful and accurate way of including higher order qcd calculations in monte - carlo event generators .",
    "it allows us to determine the correct normalization at nnlo after all experimental cuts are included , incorporates the kinematic shifts induced by hard qcd radiation at higher orders , and maintains the resummation present in parton - shower monte - carlo programs near kinematic boundaries .",
    "we believe that reweighting mc@nlo to match nnlo differential distributions gives a highly accurate description of the higgs signal at the lhc .",
    "we look forward to its application to other processes of phenomenological interest .",
