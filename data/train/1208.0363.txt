    "this has led to spectacular experiments @xcite , bridging different areas of physics .",
    "while the research directions stimulated by experiments with ultracold atoms are very diverse , one can identify several overarching trends that gained momentum in recent years .",
    "the most prominent of these trends is the effort aimed at understanding quantum phase transitions @xcite , leading to the experimental studies of bose ",

    "schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluidity @xcite and the bec  bcs crossover @xcite . with the development of techniques for trapping atoms in periodic potentials of optical lattices @xcite and single atom detection @xcite ,",
    "ultracold atoms became an ideal platform for quantum simulation of lattice models used in solid state physics @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated by the realization of the mott insulator  superfluid transition with atoms trapped in a three - dimensional optical lattice @xcite , the experiments with ultracold atoms hold the promise of insight into the details of the hubbard model , which may help unravel the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .    the development of experimental methods for the production of ultracold polar molecules @xcite has widened the possibilities for quantum simulation of condensed matter models to a great extent .",
    "a combination of the rotational , spin and hyperfine degrees of freedom with the long - range dipolar interactions enabled by the dipole moment of molecules allows for engineering a great variety of lattice models that can not be realized with atoms @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility of creating quantum phases with topological order @xcite , which are resilient to perturbations preserving the topology and are , therefore , ideal for quantum computation . to this end ,",
    "a major effort of current experiments is focused on preparing a dense ensemble of ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "another focus of research with quantum degenerate gases is on emergent phenomena , such as solitons @xcite , rotons @xcite , vortices @xcite , spin waves @xcite and polarons @xcite .",
    "these experiments aim to elucidate emergence in natural systems , and may potentially lead to the development of novel ultra - sensitive sensors of gravity and electromagnetic fields .",
    "while these studies cover a wide range of collective dynamics of ultracold atoms and molecules in a single quantum state , much less is known about the effect of internal degrees of freedom of ultracold particles .",
    "for example , the role of rotational transitions in the excitation spectrum of a molecular bose ",
    "einstein condensate had not been addressed until very recently @xcite . yet",
    ", the internal degrees of freedom can be used to explore new regimes of collective phenomena , especially in molecular systems that provide a dense spectrum of internal excitations @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider rotational excitations of polar molecules trapped on an optical lattice .",
    "these excitations give rise to rotational excitons analogous to collective electronic excitations in molecular crystals .",
    "in contrast to excitons in natural solids , the properties of rotational excitons can be dynamically controlled by tuning the energy level structure of the trapped molecules , which can be used to study new regimes of frenkel exciton physics not accessible in natural solid state crystals .",
    "for example , we show that non - linear interactions of excitons can be tuned to examine the competition between the dynamical and kinematic effects and demonstrate that rotational excitons can be used to study quantum localization in a dynamically tunable disordered potential .",
    "the rotational excitons can also be used as a basis for quantum simulation of condensed - matter models that can not be realized with ultracold atoms . as an example , we discuss the possibility of engineering the holstein model with polar molecules on an optical lattice . in order to present these results in the context of current research",
    ", we briefly describe the related work on quantum simulation of many - body hamiltonians with ultracold atoms and molecules and the basics of frenkel exciton physics .",
    "the difficulty of simulating a quantum many - body system on a classical computer increases exponentially with the number of quantum states .",
    "an alternative , currently at the focus of detailed research , is quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "quantum simulation involves the design of a controllable quantum system in order to simulate the properties of another , more complicated system ( analog quantum simulator ) .",
    "this idea is generally attributed to feynman @xcite , although quantum simulation is already mentioned in an earlier publication by manin @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of quantum simulation is the mapping of the hamiltonian of the simulated system onto the hamiltonian of the simulator with controllable parameters .",
    "tuning the parameters of the controlled system can then be used to map out the phase diagram of the simulated system .",
    "the recent literature offers many ideas about how to build quantum simulators based on ultracold quantum gases @xcite , ultracold trapped ions @xcite , single photon sources and detectors @xcite , ultracold rydberg atoms @xcite , circuit qed @xcite , quantum dots and n  v centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms trapped in a periodic potential of overlapped laser beams ( optical lattices ) is considered as one of the most promising systems for quantum simulation of lattice models @xcite . the geometry and strength of the optical lattice potentials",
    "can be controlled by adjusting the laser intensity and the beam overlap angle , which enables control over the translational motion of atoms in the lattice @xcite .",
    "the separation of the lattice sites in an optical lattice is equal to half the wavelength of the trapping laser field .",
    "recent technological breakthroughs permit the detection of ultracold atoms with sub - wavelength resolution , allowing for single - site addressing @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example of quantum simulation with ultracold atoms is the realization of the hubbard model @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 or @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation and annihilation operators for fermions , satisfying the anti - commutation rule @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the particle number operator , and @xmath8 is the energy of particles in state @xmath9 .",
    "the angle brackets @xmath10 indicate that the summation is over nearest neighbors only . in this simple form , the hubbard hamiltonian accounts for nearest neighbor tunnelling ( @xmath11 ) and on - site interactions for fermions in different spin states ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the fermions with the same spin experience hard - core repulsion .",
    "this model is widely used for the studies of high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite and quantum magnetism @xcite .    with bosonic atoms ,",
    "it is possible to realize the bose - hubbard model : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the creation and annihilation operators for bosons , satisfying the commutation rule @xmath16 = \\delta_{nm}$ ] , and @xmath17 is the particle number operator .",
    "this model has been used in many studies of the properties of bosonic gases such as superfluidity @xcite .",
    "if @xmath18 , the particles are delocalized around the lattice and the ground state of the system is a superfluid .",
    "this hamiltonian also allows for modelling the properties of fermionic systems when quantum statistics plays no role and the properties of the system are entirely determined by the relative efficiency of hopping ( governed by @xmath11 ) and the interaction ( @xmath12 ) . in particular , when @xmath19 ( the on - site repulsion dominates over the inter - site hopping ) , this bosonic hamiltonian reproduces transition to the mott insulator phase @xcite , where the number of atoms per lattice site is fixed .",
    "this transition is typical for electrons in a metal .",
    "it is thus possible to realize the same physical phenomenon with particles satisfying different quantum statistics .",
    "we shall discuss this in detail in section [ s - s - mappings ] .",
    "recent experiments demonstrated the possibility of creating the mott insulator phase with ultracold atoms filling up to 99% of the lattice sites @xcite .",
    "a major thrust of current research is to extend these experiments to ultracold molecules .",
    "the experiments with polar molecules in optical lattices offer the possibility of realizing lattice models with long - range interactions @xcite . in the bose - hubbard model",
    "the inter - site interactions are accounted for by adding to the hamiltonian ( [ h_bh ] ) a term @xmath20 describing density  density correlations . in the limit of the strong on - site repulsion ,",
    "when @xmath21 or 1 , the system reduces to the @xmath11-@xmath22 model , described by the hamiltonian @xmath23 with the constraint @xmath24 , which accounts for the infinite on - site repulsion . with @xmath25",
    "this hamiltonian corresponds to the lattice analog of the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "this model is equivalent to an anisotropic spin-@xmath26 _ xxz _ model @xcite .",
    "in addition , molecules allow for the possibility of realizing a variety of lattice spin models @xcite , such as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the pauli matrices for lattice site @xmath29 .",
    "this is the so - called heisenberg model .",
    "if the interactions are isotropic in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath30 axis , i.e. for @xmath31 , this hamiltonian reduces to the _ xxz_-model @xcite . in the isotropic heisenberg model , @xmath32 .",
    "the _ xy_-model is for the case when @xmath33 .",
    "the scalar version of the heisenberg model ( @xmath34 ) is the ising model . in the ising model ,",
    "spins are treated as scalars , which can take one of two values : @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath36    the ising model can be realized with ultracold molecules in the spin - less @xmath37 electronic state trapped on an optical lattice in a mott insulator phase with one molecule per lattice site .",
    "the rotational levels of @xmath37 molecules in an external electric field form an isolated two - level system , illustrated in figure [ f - exciton dispersion]a . the ground @xmath38 and excited @xmath39 states can be used as the spin states @xmath40 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath41 is determined by the dipole - dipole interaction between molecules in different lattice sites .",
    "the rotational excitation @xmath42 thus leads to spin waves of the ising model . in order to simulate more complicated spin models , such as eq .",
    "( [ h heisenberg ] ) , it is necessary to use molecules with more complex structure @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians presented in section [ s - s - lattice models ] describe very different physical systems , consisting of particles with all possible statistics ( bosons , fermions , spin matrices and pseudospins ) .",
    "they are , however , mutually related .",
    "some of these hamiltonians can be mapped onto each other , even when the quantum statistics of mapping and mapped particles are different .",
    "consider an ensemble of arbitrary two - level systems on a lattice .",
    "the state of a two - level system in lattice site @xmath29 can be characterized by the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 describing , respectively , the creation and destruction of the excited state .",
    "operators for different lattice sites necessarily commute , as they act on different variables . on the other hand ,",
    "the same site can not accommodate more than one excitation , which is a feature of fermi statistics .",
    "the commutation relations for the operators @xmath44 are @xmath45    the operators with such `` mixed '' statistics are called paulions ( in condensed matter physics @xcite ) or hard - core bosons ( in atomic physics @xcite ) .",
    "using the @xmath46-operators , we can write the following general hamiltonian @xmath47 which is identical to the hard - core hamiltonian ( [ h t - v ] ) with the constraint ( [ h t - v constraint ] ) absorbed into the statistical properties of paulions ( [ paulion commutations ] ) .",
    "the prime over the sum symbols indicates that @xmath48 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. when the density - density correlations are absent , the hamiltonian ( [ paulionic hamiltonian ] ) is identical to the ising hamiltonian ( [ h ising ] ) with @xmath49 .",
    "this hamiltonian is also used to model frenkel excitons in solid state molecular crystals @xcite .",
    "any unitary transformation preserves the commutation properties of the bosonic and fermionic operators . for example , the fourier transform of bosons must produce bosons . therefore , many articles have been devoted to mapping paulions onto `` effective '' particles with bosonic or fermionic statistics , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . they can be mapped onto fermionic operators by the jordan  wigner transformation @xcite , and onto bosonic operators by the holstein ",
    "primakoff transformation @xcite . ] .",
    "girardeau showed @xcite that in 1d the many - body wave function of hard - core bosons ",
    " corresponds ( up to a sign ) to a many - body wave function of a gas of fictitious non - interacting spin - less fermions .",
    "the exact mapping was proposed later by chestnut and suna for a 1d system in the nearest neighbor approximation @xcite .",
    "this is a variant of the jordan  wigner transformation @xcite , and it works very well in 1d .",
    "however , in higher dimensions it may cause problems : the effective fermionic operators are non - local , i.e. the expression for the fermionic operators in site @xmath29 is dependent on the occupation numbers at other sites .",
    "that is why this transformation is not as effective in dimensions higher than one .",
    "another possibility is to use the agranovich  toshich transformation @xcite , which expresses @xmath52-operators through an infinite series of bosonic operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in a way ensuring that for any number of bosons per lattice site @xmath55 the eigenvalues of the number operator for paulions @xmath56 are only 1 or 0 , so that the unphysical states with @xmath57 do not occur .",
    "then the paulionic hamiltonian ( [ paulionic hamiltonian ] ) reduces to a sum of terms consisting of the same number of creation and annihilation bosonic operators , which we schematically denote by @xmath58 ; @xmath59 . keeping the pairwise interactions only and assuming that @xmath60 , one obtains : @xmath61    where @xmath62    thus , the agranovich  toshich transformation reduces the pauilonic ( hard - core boson ) hamiltonian to a hamiltonian describing a gas of bosons interacting via delta - like pairwise interaction with the strength @xmath63 .",
    "higher - order corrections to the interaction energy can be obtained by including the omitted terms .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath64 describes the kinematic interaction , which we discuss in section [ s - s - s - kinematic ] .",
    "in contrast to the wigner ",
    "jordan transformation , this approach is very effective in 3d , where @xmath65 can be treated as a perturbation . for 2d systems ,",
    "the delta - like scattering with the magnitude @xmath63 , which is the largest energy scale of the problem , is very strong and does not allow for a perturbative treatment @xcite .",
    "in 1d , the effect of scattering is even stronger and the transformation to bosons makes no sense at all .",
    "to summarize , in 1d paulions are well described by a gas of fermions , in 3d by bosons , in 2d they are something in between .",
    "finally , we note that in principle it is not necessary to use any of these transformations ; one can work directly with paulions taking into account their commutation relations ( [ paulion commutations ] ) .",
    "while the majority of research with atoms and molecules on optical lattices has so far focused on quantum transport of particles in a lattice potential or quantum simulation of lattice models , such as the ones described above , the ability to control the structure of molecules trapped on an optical lattice can also be exploited to study quantum energy transport and collective excitations reminiscent of excitons in solid state crystals . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the formation of rotational excitons .",
    "these excitons have unique properties and can , in turn , be used as a basis for quantum simulation of new physical phenomena and new lattice models that can not be realized with atoms on an optical lattice .",
