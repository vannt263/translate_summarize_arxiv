    "it is well known that in a medium with a certain fluctuation level , the propagation of electromagnetic waves can lead to radiation of waves with new frequencies and wave numbers , i.e. scattered waves and also a new type of wave : transformed waves .",
    "the investigations of electromagnetic waves scattering and transformation processes are very important for studying such problems as plasma diagnostics , wave transformation mechanisms in plasma , definition of dispersion properties of plasma wave processes etc .",
    "in addition the study of the electromagnetic wave scattering spectra ( both in laser and microwave wave ranges ) is an efficient method of plasma diagnostics in laboratory fusion research devices as well as in the near and outer space .",
    "electromagnetic wave scattering is caused by thermal fluctuations of plasma density and other plasma parameters such as current density , electric and magnetic fields , etc .",
    "spectra of scattered waves provide information on the density and temperature distributions in the plasma .",
    "a peculiarity of electromagnetic wave scattering in plasmas is coherent scattering by collective plasma excitations - combination scattering that occurs along with thompson incoherent scattering by individual plasma particles .",
    "wave scattering by collective plasma fluctuations , in particular , makes it possible to find relative concentrations of charged particles and temperatures of individual plasma components .",
    "the phenomenon of electromagnetic wave combination scattering by collective plasma excitations has been considered for the first time by akhiezer et al .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently a theory of electromagnetic wave scattering in plasmas has been developed @xcite .",
    "the detailed theory of scattering and transformation of waves in magnetized plasma has been worked out in @xcite ( see also @xcite where useful reviews of the electromagnetic wave scattering problem have been presented ) .",
    "the theory has been further developed and extended in the papers @xcite ( see also references therein ) , in particular , in the case of strongly magnetized turbulent plasma @xcite .",
    "the scattering and transformation of high - frequency waves in dusty plasmas due to electron density inhomogeneities have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the scattering and transformation cross sections for two cases ( the electrons in the shielding clouds around the charged dust particles and induced electron density fluctuations discreteness ) have been calculated and it has been shown that both can be enhanced with respect to scattering from thermal fluctuations .",
    "another important mechanism for the wave scattering and transformation could be provided by the nonlinear interaction of the incident wave with the non - thermal density fluctuations ( wakefield excitations ) generated by the charged test particles moving in plasma . in particular ,",
    "if such particle is at rest and heavy and does not oscillate in the electromagnetic field of the incident wave the scattering occurs due to the nonlinear oscillation of the polarization ( shielding ) cloud surrounding the particle .",
    "it is clear that the cross section of this process essentially differs from the standard thomson cross section when the wavelength of the incident wave is comparable or smaller the size of the polarization cloud which is typically given by the debye screening length .",
    "moreover , in a nonlinear regime the polarization cloud surrounding the particle may be affected by an external strong magnetic field which introduces a strong anisotropy in the screening properties of the plasma and as a result in angular distribution of the scattered ( transformed ) waves .    in this paper",
    "we investigate this process in detail assuming that the heavy test particle is located at the plane boundary of plasma - vacuum interface .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be strongly magnetized so that the cyclotron frequency of the electrons is comparable or even larger than the plasma frequency .",
    "the case in which the incident wave propagates across the external magnetic field is considered . within cold plasma model",
    "general expressions are obtained for the angular distribution and the cross section for the scattered and transformed waves .",
    "the explicit calculations are done for specific high - frequency ordinary and extraordinary waves as well as for low - frequency upper - hybrid , lower - hybrid , and magnetosonic waves .",
    "the main problem in calculating the quantitative characteristics of electromagnetic wave scattering and transformation in plasmas is to find the current produced by the nonlinear interaction of the incident wave with the fluctuations of plasma parameters caused by the test particle .",
    "this current determines the scattered and transformed wave fields .",
    "we consider an incident wave @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the complex amplitude ) which propagates in magnetized homogeneous plasma and a heavy particle with charge @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the charge of an electron ) at rest .",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic field of the incident wave is determined by the maxwell s equation and has the form @xmath4 . in the linear approximation the incident wave and the electric field @xmath5 produced by the test particle are independent , and the fourier transformed total electric field in plasma",
    "is @xmath6    the amplitude and the frequency of the incident wave , for given values of the wave vector , are determined from the equations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , where @xmath9and @xmath10 are the maxwellian and unit tensors , respectively , and @xmath11 is the dielectric tensor of the magnetized plasma .",
    "the electric field of the stationary heavy particle is expressed by the equation @xcite @xmath12here @xmath13 is the longitudinal dielectric function of the plasma .",
    "we assume that the particle is heavy and does not oscillate in the field of the incident wave .",
    "thus the scattering originates from oscillations of the polarization cloud surrounding the particle .    to find the electromagnetic field of the scattered ( transformed ) wave , we consider the second order approximation in maxwell s equations . as a result , for the electric field @xmath14 in the second order approximation we obtain the equation @xmath15where @xmath16 is the nonlinear current associated with the nonlinear , three - index dielectric tensor @xmath17 of the magnetized plasma , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the scattered waves originate from nonlinear coupling of the incident wave with the electric field of the test particle .",
    "the scattering current corresponding to such coupling is easily obtained from equations and if in the expression obtained for the current we neglect the terms proportional to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which determine the second harmonic generation and the second order electric field of the test particle , respectively . the total scattering current is thus determined by the equation @xmath22 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tensor @xmath23 characterizes the nonlinear properties of the medium @xcite : @xmath24 the electric field @xmath25 of the scattered wave is obtained from maxwell s equation , in which the current @xmath26 is replaced by the scattering current @xmath27 .",
