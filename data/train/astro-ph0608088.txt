    "the best - fitting value , @xmath31 , is very uncertain , and the upper limit is unconstrained by our @xmath32 analysis .",

    "the fact that the sidedness ratio is less than unity in places implies that there is some intrinsic asymmetry ( section  [ badfit ] ) , but the qualitative conclusion that the edge velocity is low remains valid .",

    "we have evaluated the jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio outside the modelled region by integrating flux densities in boxes of size 10arcsec along the jet axis and @xmath3715arcsec transverse to it .",
    "the mean ratio drops from @xmath361.7 between 40 and 70arcsec from the nucleus to @xmath361.05 between 70 and 100arcsec .",

    "the errors on @xmath40 are estimated by eye because the jets are faint and any change to the index has very little effect on the value of @xmath32 , even over a small area close to the nucleus .",
    "we model the brightening point as a discontinuous increase in emissivity by a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "the short region between 1.8 and 2.5kpc is introduced primarily to model the first knots in the main and counter - jets ; its index is poorly constrained because of our inability to fit the main and counter - jet simultaneously : high values fit the counter - jet knot well but overestimate the main jet brightness ; small values have the opposite problem .",
    "the main section of the bright jet base from 2.5  8.9kpc is described by a power law of index @xmath42 .",

    "we were able to fit the polarization structure in 3c296 accurately using a model with only toroidal and longitudinal magnetic - field components .",
    "the best fitting model has field - component ratios which vary from the nucleus out to a distance of 14.6kpc , consistent with the boundary between flaring and outer regions , and thereafter remain constant .",
    "the field at the edge of the jet is almost purely toroidal everywhere ( figs  [ fig : bprofs]c , [ fig : bcol]a ) , although there is a marginally significant longitudinal component close to the nucleus ( figs  [ fig : bprofs]d , [ fig : bcol]b ) . on - axis",
    ", in contrast , the longitudinal field is initially dominant , but decreases over the flaring region to a smaller , but still significant value at larger distances ( figs  [ fig : bprofs]b , [ fig : bcol]b ) .",
    "we have described the magnetic field structure as disordered on small scales , but anisotropic .",
    "a field of this type in an axisymmetric model always generates symmetrical transverse profiles of total intensity , degree of polarization and apparent field position angle .",
    "in contrast , a globally - ordered helical field , unless observed at 90@xmath1 to the line of sight in its rest frame , will always generate asymmetric profiles @xcite .",
    "the observed profiles in 3c296 ( figs  [ fig : transi ] , [ fig : transpol ] ) are very symmetrical , even in regions where the longitudinal and transverse field components have comparable amplitudes , so we conclude that a simple , globally - ordered field configuration can not fit the data .",
    "our calculations would , however , be unchanged if one of the two field components were vector - ordered ; in particular , a configuration in which the toroidal component is ordered but the longitudinal one is not would be entirely consistent with our results .",

    "we demonstrated in section  [ badfit ] that this emission is indeed present and that it has the correct polarization in the counter - jet . in the main jet , contamination by surrounding lobe emission",
    "confuses the issue , but there is a real discrepancy ( fig.[fig : transpol]g ) : the observed apparent field remains transverse at the edges .",
    "the difference between the main and counter - jets can not be an effect of aberration as we infer velocities @xmath45 in these regions .",
    "there must , therefore , be a significant radial field component at the edge of the main jet which is not present at the corresponding location in the counter - jet . although the low - resolution 8.5-ghz image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivecdeep ] gives the impression that the jet might propagate within its associated lobe while the counter - jet is in direct contact with interstellar medium , the l - band images ( fig .",

    "fig : bprofs ] , arbitrarily normalised to the model values at a distance of 14kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the evolution of the longitudinal / toroidal ratio towards a toroidally - dominated configuration is qualitatively as expected for flux - freezing in an expanding and decelerating flow , but the model shows a much slower decrease . in the absence of any radial field , the ratio should not be affected by shear in the laminar velocity field we have assumed , but the field evolution is clearly more complex than such a simple picture would predict . a small radial field component could still be present , and this would allow the growth of longitudinal field via the strong shear that we infer in 3c296 .",
    "we will investigate this process using the axisymmetric adiabatic models developed by @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that the flow is turbulent in the flaring region",
    ". two - dimensional turbulence ( with no velocity component in the radial direction ) would lead to amplification of the longitudinal component without generating a large radial component , as required .",

    "strikingly similar structures are seen in the jets of 3c31 ( lb ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c31 ] . in both sources ,",
    "the arcs have systematically different shapes in the main and counter - jets : centre - brightened arcs with well - defined intensity gradients near the jet axis [ type ( i ) ] are found in the main jets of both sources and in the outer counter - jet of 3c296 , while more elongated arcs with well - defined intensity gradients near the jet edges [ type ( ii ) ] are found in both counter - jets .",
    "we will present models of the arc structures elsewhere : here we demonstrate that relativistic aberration can plausibly account for the systematic difference .",
    "suppose that an arc is a thin , axisymmetric shell of enhanced emissivity , concave towards the nucleus , and that at any point its speed is roughly that of the local average flow .",
    "close to the centre - line of the jet , the shell can be approximated as a planar sheet of material orthogonal to the axis in the observed frame .",
    "aberration causes a moving object to appear at the angle to the line of sight appropriate to the rest frame of the flow @xcite . for the the normals to the sheets in the main and counter - jets these angles are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where : @xmath60^{-1 } \\\\",

    "the arcs are visible as far as @xmath3690arcsec from the nucleus  outside the region we model ",
    "so we do not have a direct measure of the average velocity field in their vicinity . given that our model indicates a roughly constant velocity on - axis from 10  40arcsec from the nucleus we will assume for the purposes of a rough estimate that the parameters at the outer edge of the model approximate the average flow parameters near the arcs between 40 and 70arcsec , where the mean jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio remains significantly larger than unity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aberrate ] we plot @xmath58 and @xmath61 against @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( table  [ tab : results ] ) . for a velocity @xmath64 , the angles to the line of sight in the fluid rest frame are @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( the main jet is close to the maximum boost condition @xmath67 which corresponds to edge - on emission in the rest frame ) .",
    "a sheet of enhanced emissivity which is normal to the flow on the jet axis is therefore observed nearly edge - on in the main jet , appearing narrow , with a high brightness gradient . in the counter - jet , on the other hand , the same sheet would appear to be significantly rotated about a line perpendicular to the jet axis in the plane of the sky and therefore less prominent both in intensity and in brightness gradient .",
    "close to the edges of the jets , however , the model flow velocities are essentially zero , so the effects of aberration should be negligible . if the shells are roughly tangential to the surface , then we expect to see narrow brightness enhancements orientated parallel to the edges in both jets .",
    "this picture provides a reasonable qualitative description of the differences in arc structure for the main and counter - jets in 3c296 within @xmath3670arcsec of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : i1.5 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the mean jet / counter - jet ratio suggests that the jets become sub - relativistic at larger distances ( section  [ results : vel ] ) and this may explain why we see type ( i ) arcs in both jets between 70 and 90arcsec .",
    "the hypothesis that the main difference in appearance of the arcs between the main and counter - jets is an effect of differential relativistic aberration also allows us to predict that differences should be observed between main and counter - jet arcs in other fri sources if they are orientated at moderate angles to the line of sight .",
    "this explains why we observe systematic differences in the arcs of 3c31 , which has similar model parameters to 3c296 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3c31 ] , lb ) , but we would not expect differences between the main and counter - jet arcs if @xmath58 and @xmath61 are similar .",
    "the latter condition holds if the jets are close to the plane of the sky ( e.g.  3c449 and pks1333 - 33 ; @xcite ) or slow ( e.g.  the outer region of b20326 + 39 ; cl ) .",
    "it will therefore be interesting to search for arcs in deep images of these sources .",
    "we have modelled five fri sources : 3c31 ( lb ) , b20326 + 39 , b21553 + 24 ( cl ) , ngc315 ( clbc ) and 3c296 ( this paper ) .",
    "we will compare and contrast their properties in detail elsewhere , but in this section we summarize their similarities and differences and draw attention to a few potential problems with our approach .",

    ", decelerating jet model fits the observed brightness and polarization distributions and asymmetries well .",
    "the outer boundaries of the well - resolved parts of the jets can be divided into two main regions : a _ flaring _ region with a rapidly increasing expansion rate followed by recollimation and an _",
    "region with a uniform expansion rate .",
    "3 .   close to the nucleus ,",
    "the on - axis velocity is initially consistent with @xmath68 . on - axis",
    ", rapid deceleration then occurs over distances of 1  10kpc , after which the velocity either stays constant or decreases less rapidly .",
    "all except b21553 + 24 have low emissivity at the base of the `` flaring '' region , so even the main jet is initially very faint ( this region may be present but unresolved in b21553 + 24 ) .",
    "the faint region ends at a `` brightening point '' where the emissivity profile flattens suddenly or even increases .",
    "this , coupled with the rapid expansion of the jets , leads to a sudden increase in surface brightness in the main jets ( not necessarily in the counter - jets , whose emission is doppler suppressed ) .",
    "the brightening point is always _ before _ the start of rapid deceleration , which in turn is completed before the jets recollimate .",
    "immediately after the brightening point , all of the jets contain bright substructure with complex , non - axisymmetric features which we can not model in detail .",
    "optical / ultraviolet or x - ray emission has been detected in all of the jets observed so far with _",
    "chandra _ ( results for b20326 + 39 are not yet available ) .",
    "high - energy emission is associated with the bright regions of the main jets before the onset of rapid deceleration in all cases , and also with the faint inner region in 3c31 .",
    "the longitudinal emissivity profile may be represented by three power - law segments separated by short transitions .",
    "the indices of the power laws decrease with distance from the nucleus .",
    "all of the jets are intrinsically centre - brightened , with fractional emissivities at their edges @xmath360.1  0.5 where these are well - determined .",
    "11 . on average ,",
    "the largest single magnetic field component is toroidal .",
    "the longitudinal component is significant close to the nucleus but decreases with distance .",
    "the radial component is always the smallest of the three .",
    "12 . for those sources we have fit with functional forms allowing variation of field - component ratios across the jets ( 3c31 , ngc315 and 3c296 )",
    ", we find that the toroidal component is stronger relative to the longitudinal component at the edge of the jet ( this is likely to be true for the other two sources )",
    "the evolution of the field component ratios along the jets before they recollimate is not consistent with flux freezing in a laminar flow , which requires a much more rapid transition from longitudinal to transverse field than we infer .",
    "a possible reason for this is two - dimensional turbulence ( with no radial velocity component ) in the flaring regions .",
    "after recollimation , flux freezing is consistent with our results . 14",
    ". the inferred evolution of the radial / toroidal field ratio ( in those sources where the radial component is non - zero ) is qualitatively inconsistent with flux freezing even if shear in a laminar velocity field is included .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional adiabatic approximation ( together with flux freezing ) is grossly inconsistent with the emissivity evolution required by our models before the jets decelerate and recollimate .",
    "earlier attempts to infer fractional changes in velocity from surface - brightness profiles @xcite , therefore required much more rapid deceleration than we deduce in these regions .",
    "16 . after deceleration and recollimation ,",
    "the emissivity evolution along the jets is described quite well by flux freezing and a quasi - one - dimensional adiabatic approximation ( our analysis does not cover this region in ngc315 ) .",
    "as relativistic effects are slight , the brightness evolution in the outer regions of 3c296 , b20326 + 39 and b21553 + 24 is quite close to the constant - speed , perpendicular - field prediction originally derived by @xcite .",
    "previous estimates of fractional velocity changes derived on the adiabatic assumption [ references as in ( xv ) , above ] are likely to be more reliable on these larger scales .    .",
    "the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight is @xmath69 , as we infer for 3c296 .",
    "full line : main jet ; dashed line : counter - jet .",
    "the vertical dotted line marks the on - axis velocity of @xmath70 we derive for the outer parts of the modelled region in 3c296 .",
    "[ fig : aberrate],width=321 ]      3c296 exhibits the following differences from the other sources :    1 .",
    "the transverse velocity profile falls to a low fractional value @xmath71 at the edge of the jets in 3c296 , whereas all the other sources are consistent with an edge / on - axis velocity ratio @xmath360.7 everywhere , and also with a top - hat velocity profile at the brightening point .",
    "this could be related to the differences in lobe structure : as noted earlier , 3c296 is the only source we have observed with a bridged twin - jet structure .",
    "its jets may then be embedded ( almost ) completely within the lobes rather than propagating in direct contact with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "modelling of other bridged fri sources would then be expected to show similarly low edge velocities .",
    "whether the lower - velocity material is best regarded as part of the jets or the lobes ( and , indeed , whether this distinction is meaningful ) remains unclear .",
    "2 .   some support for the idea of an interaction between jets and lobes comes from our detection of anomalous ( i.e.  inconsistent with our model predictions ) polarization at the edges of the main jet in its outer parts .",
    "we have argued that this can not be a simple superposition of unrelated jet and lobe emission .",
    "rapid deceleration is complete before the end of the bright region in 3c296 .",
    "in contrast , the bright region ends within the deceleration zone for b20326 + 39 , b21553 + 24 and ngc315 and the end of the bright region roughly coincides with the end of rapid deceleration in 3c31 .",
    "4 .   when deciding where in the jets our hypothesis of intrinsic symmetry first becomes inappropriate , we have successfully used the criterion that the jets must remain straight while selecting the region to be analysed . in 3c296",
    "however there are hints of intrinsic asymmetries on a still smaller scale because the counter - jet appears to be slightly wider than the main jet in the flaring region .",
    "our results are generally consistent with the conclusions of a statistical study of a larger sample of fri sources with jets @xcite , but the velocity range at the brightening point derived from the distribution of jet / counter - jet ratios assuming an isotropic sample has a maximum @xmath72 and a minimum in the range @xmath73 .",
    "such a range would be expected if low edge velocities ( as in 3c296 ) are indeed typical of bridged twin - jet sources , since these form the majority of the sample @xcite .",
    "we have made deep , 8.5-ghz images of the nearby fri radio galaxy 3c296 with the vla at resolutions ranging from 0.25 to 5.5arcsec fwhm , revealing new details of its twin jets .",
    "in particular we see several thin , discrete brightness enhancements ( `` arcs '' ) in both jets .",
    "these appear to have systematically different morphologies in the main and counter - jets .",
    "a comparison with lower - frequency images from archive data shows that the flat - spectrum jets are surrounded by a broad sheath of steeper - spectrum diffuse emission , possibly formed by a backflow of radiating plasma which has suffered significant synchrotron losses as in models of frii sources .",
    "the spectral index of the jets initially flattens slightly with distance from the nucleus ( from @xmath74 to @xmath75 ) as in other fri jets .",
    "we have also imaged the faraday rotation and depolarization over the source .",
    "the counter - jet is more depolarized than the main jet , but the differences in depolarization and faraday rotation variance between the two lobes are small .",
    "the rms fluctuations in rotation measure are larger close to the nucleus in both lobes .",
    "we have shown that many features of the synchrotron emission from the inner @xmath3740arcsec of the jets in 3c296 can be fit accurately and self - consistently on the assumption that they are intrinsically symmetrical , axisymmetric , decelerating , relativistic flows .",
    "the functional forms we use for the model are similar to those developed in our earlier work , as are most of the derived physical parameters . in this sense ,",
    "a strong family resemblance is emerging between the physical properties that we derive for the outflows in these fri sources .    * geometry * : :    the jets can be divided into a flaring region , whose radius    @xmath49 is well fitted by the expression    @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the    distance from the nucleus along the axis , and a conical outer region .",
    "we infer an angle to the line of sight of    @xmath78degree .",
    "the boundary between the two regions    is then at 15.8kpc from the nucleus . * velocity structure * : :    where the jets first brighten , their on - axis velocity is    @xmath79 , but this value is poorly constrained .",
    "rapid deceleration occurs around 5kpc to an on - axis velocity of    @xmath80 which thereafter remains    constant .",
    "3c296 differs from all of the other objects we have studied    in having a very low velocity ( essentially consistent with 0 ) at the    edges of its jets . *",
    "emissivity * : :    the longitudinal profile of rest - frame emissivity is modelled as three    principal power - law sections @xmath81    with indices of @xmath82 ( 0  1.8kpc ) , @xmath83    ( 2.5  8.9kpc ) and @xmath84 ( 8.9  24.5kpc , the end of the    modelled region ) .",
    "the first two regions are separated by a short    transition zone in which the emissivity increases discontinuously by a    factor of @xmath367 and then has a power - law slope    @xmath572.1 ( 1.8  2.5kpc ; representing the first knots in    the main and counter - jets ) .",
    "the rest - frame emissivity is    centre - brightened . *",
    "magnetic - field configuration * : :    we model the magnetic field as disordered , but anisotropic , with    toroidal and longitudinal components , but our results are equally    consistent with an ordered toroidal component .",
    "we rule out a    globally - ordered helical field .",
    "the ratio of longitudinal to toroidal    field decreases with distance from the nucleus ; the toroidal component    is also more dominant at the edges of the jets . * flux freezing * : :    the field - component evolution is qualitatively consistent with flux    freezing , but much slower than expected in the flaring region , where    the adiabatic approximation also fails to fit the emissivity    variation . in the outer region , after the jets decelerate , the    adiabatic approximation is a reasonable fit . *",
    "arc asymmetry * : :    if the arcs are narrow shells of enhanced emissivity moving with the    underlying flow , then the differences in their appearance in the main    and counter - jets can be understood as the effect of relativistic    aberration , as required for a fully self - consistent model of the jets .",
