    "we focus on patients who are hospitalized and monitored in a regular ward in anticipation of potential clinical deterioration that may require an icu admission .",
    "patients are monitored via a set of @xmath0 physiological streams ( i.e. vital signs and lab tests ) which manifest their latent clinical states .",
    "the physiological measurements of every patient are gathered in discrete time steps @xmath1 ( e.g. one measurement every 4 hours ) , and clinicians assess the patient s state in real - time accordingly . at every time step @xmath2 , a patient resides in 1 out of @xmath3 possible clinical states ; each state reflects a certain level of severity of the patient s clinical condition .",
    "state indexes reflect the levels of clinical severity , i.e. state 1 is a _ clinical stability state _ in which a patient can be safely discharged from the ward , whereas state @xmath3 is a _ clinical deterioration state _ that requires transferring the patient urgently to the icu .",
    "the clinical state - space is defined as @xmath4 ; states are hidden , but manifest themselves through the physiological measurements , which are modeled as follows [ 1 ] @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an @xmath7-dimensional _ latent factor _ , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a vector comprising the physiological data , @xmath10 is the patient s latent state , and for every @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the ( stable ) matrices describing the linear dynamics , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the clinical state sequence @xmath15 follows a semi - markovian model ; semi - markovianity eliminates the unrealistic assumption of memoryless state transitions adopted by ordinary markov chains .",
    "we adopt an explicit - duration semi - markov model for the state sequence @xmath15 [ 2 ] .",
    "that is , the patient s state evolves through a sequence of _ super - states _",
    "@xmath16 , with each super - states lasting for a random duration @xmath17 which follows a distribution @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the parameter of the duration distribution @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is a _ negative binomial distribution _ ; the _ geometric distribution _ is a special case of the negative binomial distribution , and thus our model encapsulates markovian transitions as a special case .",
    "the patient s state at time @xmath2 takes a value @xmath21 as long as the time step @xmath2 is occupied by the super - state duration @xmath17 .",
    "the super - state transition probabilities are time - homogeneous and are given by @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the super - states have a _ gambler s ruin _ structure as shown in figure 1 , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "such a structure is advantageous for the following reasons .",
    "first , it adds a semantic ingredient to the states that facilitate their interpretability , i.e. state @xmath25 is a clinical stability ( absorbing ) state , state @xmath3 is a clinical deterioration ( absorbing ) state , and all other states are transient states with intermediate , monotonically increasing levels of clinically severity .",
    "second , such a structure facilitates unsupervised model learning when an informatively censored dataset is available , i.e. if physiological observations are recorded until one of the absorbing states materialize , and such state is declared in the dataset .",
    "the initial super - state probabilities are denoted as @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "every patient s super - state sequence @xmath28 comprises @xmath29 super - states that are terminated by an absorbing states , i.e. @xmath30 , and hence @xmath29 the random number of clinical state transitions that a patient experiences during her hospitalization .",
    "we call the physiological model described above a semi - markov switching linear gaussian model ( sslgm ) , and denote every instantiation of such a model as @xmath31 with the parameter set @xmath32 given by @xmath33    in order to capture the heterogeneity of the patients population , we assume that the patients physiological data are drawn from a mixture of sslgm models with @xmath34 mixture components , i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the mixture weight and the parameter set for model @xmath38 respectively , whereas @xmath39 is the patient s baseline admission information , i.e. the static information gathered about the patient upon admission to the ward , such as the age , gender , icd9 code , etc .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 is a linear function of @xmath41 for every @xmath38 , and that the clinical state - space @xmath42 is shared among all the models .",
    "@xmath43      \\psframebox{\\pnode(0,3pt){s1 } 1 } & \\psframebox{2 } & \\psframebox{3 } & \\psframebox{4 } & \\psframebox{5\\pnode(0,3pt){s5 } }      \\psset{offset=-1.5pt , nodesep = -1pt , arcanglea=30,arcangleb=30 }      \\nccircle[anglea=90 , nodesep=8pt]{s1}{0.4}\\nbput{\\scriptstyle1 }      \\ncarc[nodesep = -1pt]{1,1}{1,2}^{p_{21}}\\ncarc{1,2}{1,3}^{p_{32 } } \\ncarc{1,3}{1,4}^{p_{43 } }      \\psset{offset=-0.5pt , nodesep=-0.5pt }      \\ncarc{1,3}{1,2}_{p_{23}}\\ncarc{1,4}{1,3}_{p_{34 } } \\ncarc{1,5}{1,4}_{p_{45 } }      \\nccircle[anglea=-90 , nodesep=8pt]{s5}{0.4}\\nbput{\\scriptstyle1 }      \\end{psmatrix}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we develop an algorithm for learning the mixture model @xmath44 from an offline ehr dataset @xmath45 . real - time inference of the clinical state for a newly hospitalized patient is then carried out using forward filtering in an online fashion .",
    "the offline dataset @xmath46 comprises the physiological data streams recorded for @xmath47 previously hospitalized patients , where @xmath48 is the amount of time the patient was hospitalized in the ward , @xmath49 is her admission information , and @xmath50 is the clinicians intervention ; @xmath51 means that patient @xmath52 was discharged home , whereas @xmath53 means that the patient was transferred to the icu .",
    "we treat @xmath50 as a label for the absorbing state that has materialized for patient @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath51 corresponds to state @xmath25 and @xmath53 corresponds to state @xmath3 ) .",
    "algorithm 1 encapsulates the pseudocode for both the learning and inference algorithms . in these algorithms ,",
    "we use the following divergence measure between two segments @xmath54 and @xmath55 of lengths @xmath56 and @xmath57 in a time series [ 3 ] @xmath58 where @xmath59 .        detect the change points in @xmath60 using the non - parametric _ e - divisive _ and",
    "_ e - agglo _ algorithms with the divergence measure @xmath61 to obtain estimates for the number of super - states @xmath62 and their durations @xmath63 . assign a label 1 to all the absorbing states ( @xmath64 ) for all patients with @xmath51 , and a label @xmath3 to all the absorbing states ( @xmath65 ) for all patients with @xmath53 .",

    "kalman filter _ via the estimated sslgm parameters .",
    "estimate the state sequence @xmath70 using a _ rauch - tung - striebel _ ( rts ) smoother .",
    "estimate the patient s risk score @xmath71 using _ forward filtering _ for the estimated super - states and their durations up to time @xmath2 .",
    "the operation of the learning algorithms can be summarized as follows . using the non - parametric e - divisive and e - agglo algorithms",
    ", we can detect the change points in every patient s physiological sequence @xmath72 , and hence we can estimate the start and end times of every hidden super - state for those patients . conditioned on the super - state durations , the super - state transitions reduce to an ordinary markov process that is described by the markov chain in figure 1 . using the absorbing state label for every patient and exploiting the gambler s ruin transition structure , we can assign a label to the last three states in every patient s super - state sequence ( e.g. the last three super - state are states @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath3 if @xmath75 as shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "the preceding states can then be labeled by creating _",
    "conflict groups _ of potential states that could have materialized in a certain time slot , and selecting the one for which the divergence measure between the observations associated with that state with respect to a previously labeled state is minimized ( e.g. in the conflict group highlighted in figure 2 , we resolve the conflict by picking state @xmath74 if the divergence measure with the observations associated with the previous labeled state @xmath74 at time slot @xmath76 is minimized ) . this _",
    "backward labeling _",
    "procedure proceeds until all states are labeled , and hence the sslgm becomes a conditionally linear gaussian model for which a direct application of the em algorithm can allow learning the model parameters [ 4 ] .",
    "online risk scoring is achieved by estimating the monitored patient s latent states @xmath70 using the rts smoothing algorithm , mapping those states to an estimated super - states sequence and durations , and then computing the probability of the super - states sequence being absorbed in state @xmath3 .",
    "we evaluated the utility of our model by conducting experiments on a heterogeneous cohort of 6,094 patients admitted to a general medicine floor in a large academic medical center in the period between march 2013 to february 2016 .",
    "the cohort comprised patients with various icd-9 codes corresponding to a wide variety of medical conditions ( e.g. pneumonia , hematologic malignancies , sepsis , septicemia , etc ) .",
    "we trained a 3-state sslgm model using a training set comprising the patients admitted in the period between march 2013 and july 2015 ( 4936 patients ) .",
    "the learned super - state transition parameters are @xmath77 and the estimated duration distribution for state 2 is @xmath78    .performance of various risk scoring methods ( @xmath79lr : logistic regression .",
    "@xmath80rf : random forest ) .",

    "all algorithms were tested on the most recent patient records ( 1155 patients admitted between july 2015 and february 2016 ) .",
    "the sslgm model outperforms the rothman index in predicting icu admissions by @xmath81 , and outperforms random forest by 11@xmath82 ( @xmath83-values @xmath84 0.01 ) .",
    "similarly , the sslgm model outperforms all other methods in predicting both icu admissions and discharges from the ward .",
    "figure 3 depicts the operation of the inference algorithm for one clinically deteriorating patient who ended up going to the icu .",
    "as we can see , the proposed model predicts clinical deterioration for this representative patient 20 hours prior to the patient decompensating and requiring an emergent transfer to the icu .",
    "the extra time afforded by this substantially earlier warning might allow the clinician sufficient time to prevent the patient from clinical deterioration the average timeliness of the predictions issued by the sslgm model is 8 hours for a tpr of @xmath85 and a ppv of @xmath86 .",
