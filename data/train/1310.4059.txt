    "a few meters below the surface of a neutron star at densities above @xmath0 g@xmath1@xmath2 , atomic nuclei are fully ionized by the pressure thus coexisting with a highly degenerate electron gas . as the density increases ,",
    "nuclei become more and more neutron - rich due to electron captures  @xcite until neutrons start to drip out of nuclei at densities above @xmath3 g@xmath1@xmath2  @xcite thus delimiting the boundary between the outer and inner parts of the crust .",
    "those `` free '' neutrons are expected to become superfluid below a critical temperature of the order of @xmath4  k. despite the absence of viscous drag , the neutron superfluid can still be strongly coupled to the crust due to non - dissipative entrainment effects  @xcite .",
    "although the crust of a neutron star represents only about @xmath5 of the star s mass , it is expected to play a key role in various observed astrophysical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the collective excitations in the inner crust of a neutron star can impact the thermal evolution of the star  @xcite .",
    "these excitations have been already studied in the wigner - seitz approximation , using self - consistent mean - field methods with skyrme effective interactions  @xcite . in this approach , the crust is divided into a set of independent spheres centered around each nucleus .",
    "consequently , only high - energy collective excitations with wavelengths smaller than the size of the wigner - seitz cell can be studied in this framework . moreover",
    ", this approximate treatment of the crust does not take into account entrainment effects , which arise from bragg scattering of unbound neutrons by the coulomb lattice .",
    "for this reason , we have recently followed a different approach by employing the band theory of solids . in this way",
    ", we have been able to study low - energy collective modes including entrainment effects  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous study of collective modes by including the coupling of the neutron superfluid to the strain field .",
    "the normal modes of oscillations of the neutron superfluid permeating the neutron - star inner crust can be obtained by linearizing the elasto - hydrodynamic equations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . treating the crust as an isotropic solid , the normal modes",
    "consists of two transverse modes and two longitudinal modes . using the same notations as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the speed of the transverse modes is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the shear modulus of the crust and @xmath8 is the mass density associated with lattice vibrations . because unbound neutrons are entrained by the crust , the mass density is much larger than the ion mass density , and is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the nucleon mass , @xmath11 the proton density and @xmath12 the density of entrained neutrons . in other words , including entrainment significantly reduces the values of @xmath13 . the longitudinal modes",
    "satisfy a dispersion relation for two coupled modes , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the speed of the bogoliubov - anderson bosons of the neutron superfluid , and @xmath16 is the speed of longitudinal lattice phonons .",
    "the mixing between these two modes is characterized by the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the neutron chemical potential and @xmath22 the neutron density ) , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the density of `` conduction '' neutrons .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is identical to eq .",
    "( 34 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite although it is expressed here in a slightly different form .    in our previous study",
    "@xcite , we assumed that the coupling of the superfluid to the strain field embedded in the coefficient @xmath25 is small , and we thus set @xmath26 .",
    "we now include this coefficient .",
    "the two solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "in the non - superfluid phase , any relative motion between the neutron liquid and the crust will be damped by viscosity to the effect that ions , electrons and neutrons will be essentially comoving .",
    "only one longitudinal mode corresponding to ordinary hydrodynamic sound will persist and its speed will be given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total mass density of the crust and @xmath31 is the total bulk modulus , which is related to the bulk modulus @xmath32 of the electron - ion system by @xmath33 . assuming that pairing affects neither the composition nor the elastic properties of the crust , the coefficient @xmath25 can be obtained by inverting the previous equation , thus yielding @xmath34",
    "as in our previous work  @xcite , we use the inner crust composition given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was obtained from the fourth - order extended thomas - fermi method with proton quantum shell effects added via the strutinsky - integral theorem .",
    "this so - called etfsi method is a high - speed approximation to the self - consistent hartree - fock equations .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite were carried out using the bsk14 skyrme interaction underlying the hfb-14 atomic mass model  @xcite , which yields an excellent fit to essentially all experimental atomic mass data with a root mean square deviation of 0.73 mev .",
    "moreover , the bsk14 interaction was also constrained to reproduce a realistic neutron - matter equation of state . for these reasons ,",
    "this interaction is particularly well - suited for describing the inner crust of a neutron star .",
    "although the neutron quantum shell effects are much smaller than proton ones  @xcite , and therefore are expected to have a small impact on the crustal composition , they drastically affect the entrainment between the neutron superfluid and the crust .",
    "neutron quantum shell effects were systematically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the band theory of solids using the mean - field potentials obtained self - consistently from the etfsi method in ref .",
    "this allowed the calculation of the conduction neutron density @xmath35 .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath37 are calculated as in ref .",
    "the @xmath25 coefficient is then estimated from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the numerical results are shown in table  [ tab ] .",
    "it can be seen that the coupling of the superfluid to the strain field reduces the speed of the highest longitudinal mixed mode , whereas the speed of the lowest longitudinal mixed mode is barely affected .",
    "since the contribution of a collective excitation with velocity @xmath38 to the heat capacity varies like @xmath39 at low temperatures , taking the coefficient @xmath25 into account substantially increases the heat capacity of the highest longitudinal mixed mode , which is enhanced by about a factor of @xmath40 at temperature @xmath41  k near the neutron - drip transition , as compared to our previous estimates .",
    "however , the contribution of this mode to the crustal heat capacity still remains negligible , as shown in fig .",
    "likewise , the thermal conductivity of the crust remains almost unchanged compared to our previous estimates .",
    "indeed , the electron - phonon scattering rate , which scales like @xmath39 , is dominated by processes involving transverse phonons .",
