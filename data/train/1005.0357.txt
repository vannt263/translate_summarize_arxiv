    "over the last two decades inertial sensors based on atom interferometry have been realized . in particular , as described in @xcite , cold atoms gravimeters can reached performances comparable to `` classical '' corner cube gravimeters both in terms of sensitivity @xcite and accuracy .",
    "the first and unique comparison between atomic and optical gravimeters @xcite has shown an agreement between the sensors ( @xmath1galgal=@xmath2m.s@xmath3 difference ) . in this paper , we present the result of a comparison , realized between the cold atom gravimeter ( cag ) developed by lne - syrte in the frame of the french watt balance project @xcite and the fg5#220 of leibniz universitt of hannover ( luh ) @xcite .",
    "both rely on the measurement of the trajectory of free falling bodies ( corner cube for fg5 and @xmath4rb atoms for cag ) .",
    "unlike the situation described in @xcite , both sensors are mobile which makes regular comparisons at various sites possible .",
    "such comparisons between instruments based on different technologies are of fundamental interest for accurate metrology of @xmath5 .",
    "this motivated the participation of both devices to icag09 and the subsequent bilateral comparison presented in this paper .",
    "for this purpose , both sensors were moved from bipm to the gravimetry room ( _ gr _ ) of the lne watt balance laboratory @xcite , where they performed simultaneous gravity measurements .",
    "the cag is an improved version of a prototype described in @xcite which reached a short term sensitivity to acceleration of @xmath6 at 1  s. it is composed of three parts  : a dropping chamber on its isolation platform ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) , a compact optical bench ( 60@xmath7  @xmath8 ) @xcite and two 2  m lab racks for the electronic control .",
    "the earth s acceleration measurement is deduced from the phase difference between the two paths of an interferometer realized with cold atoms .",
    "the fg5 absolute gravimeter of luh is a state - of - the - art commercial gravimeter which is essentialy a modified mach - zender `` in - line '' interferometer as described in @xcite .",
    "gravimeters measured simultaneously all the night in the well characterized _ gr _ room @xcite .",
    "the fg5#220 was located on point _",
    "_ gr__@xmath9 with one drop per 30  s. the result transferred at 120  cm is reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the cag was on point _",
    "_ gr__@xmath10 , measuring at the high cycling rate of 3  hz .",
    "its result , also transferred at 120  cm , is reported in table [ tab1 ] . the two points _",
    "_ gr__@xmath10 and _ _ gr__@xmath9 are 2.12  m apart and the tie between them , obtained with a scintrex cg5 , is _ _",
    "g__@xmath11-__g__@xmath12 = @xmath13gal at the height of 120  cm @xcite .",
    "transferred on point _",
    "_ gr__@xmath10 at @xmath14 , the difference between the devices is @xmath0gal .",
    "the @xmath5 measurements uncorrected from tides are displayed on figure [ signaux ] .",
    "the stability is characterized by the allan standard deviation of the tide - corrected @xmath5 measurements ( fig .",
    "[ var ] ) .",
    ".gravity results at @xmath14 height . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     despite different vibration isolation systems and repetition rates , the signal dispersions are similar except during first hours of the comparison , as can be seen on the figure [ var ] .",
    "measurements are found to be less noisy after midnight due to the drastic reduction of the human activity in the surrounding industrial area . at best",
    ", the fg5 drop scatter is @xmath15gal .",
    "the cag s @xmath5 determination is based on four successive configurations measurement in order to reject the bias due to the two photon light shift @xcite .",
    "this degrades the sensitivity by a factor @xmath16 .",
    "better sensitivity could also be obtained with the fg5 if performing with one drop per 10  s rather than 30  s chosen to preserve the device .",
    "rotating the cag by @xmath17 around the vertical axis , we measured a coriolis shift of @xmath18gal .",
    "varying the temperature of the atoms enabled us to evaluate the bias due to wavefront abberations @xcite to @xmath19gal . during this comparison ,",
    "the lack of rigidity of the mechanical structure resulted in a relatively large vertical alignment bias of @xmath20gal .",
    "the final accuracy was @xmath21gal . in @xcite",
    "an error analysis of the fg5 system lead to a total uncertainty of @xmath22gal . from numerous comparisons with other absolute gravimeters since 2002 , the luh group estimates the accuracy of their device to be @xmath23gal @xcite .",
    "result measured by fg5#220 on point",
    "_ _ gr__@xmath9 agrees with the mean of previous measurements performed with other fg5s on the same point , in october 2006 @xcite ( difference of @xmath24gal ) .",
    "we have compared two different portable absolute gravimeters and found an agreement of @xmath0gal .",
    "more such comparisons will be realized in the future while striving to improve the accuracy of the cag down to 1  @xmath25gal .",
    "already , the vertical alignment bias has been reduce to @xmath26gal .",
    "future comparisons will benefit from the mobility of atomic sensors as described here .",
    "transportability is an important and original feature of the cag , which is necessary for regular participation to comparison campaigns . nevertheless , cag is still a laboratory device but such comparisons as the `` field '' gravimetric measurements would benefit from development of a more compact gravimeter as described in @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank ifraf and esf ( euroquasar ) for financial support .",
