    "among the many important physics processes which can be studied at a future high - energy photon linear collider ( plc ) @xcite , the production of higgs bosons , @xmath6 , stands out .",
    "in particular , identification of an intermediate - mass standard model higgs boson via its ( dominant ) @xmath7 decay channels seems feasible and would provide an important measurement of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 partial decay widths .    the dominant ( continuum )",
    "background to @xmath8 comes from the standard model processes @xmath9 .",
    "various techniques can be used to suppress these .",
    "the most effective appears to be to _ polarize _ the initial ",
    "state photons : higgs bosons are only produced from an initial state with @xmath10 , whereas the leading - order @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) backgrounds are dominantly produced from the @xmath13 initial state .",
    "more precisely , production from the @xmath10 state is suppressed by @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "hence in the region of the higgs resonance @xmath15 and the @xmath16 and @xmath17 backgrounds are heavily suppressed .    unfortunately , the @xmath18 suppression of the @xmath2 background does not survive beyond leading order in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , there is no corresponding mass suppression of the @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath10 amplitude squared .",
    "although this gives rise notionally to three - jet configurations , in certain circumstances ( for example , collinear @xmath21 splitting followed by @xmath22 compton scattering ) these can mimic the two - jet higgs @xmath23 signal .",
    "of course a combination of @xmath24-tagging of both jets and three - jet veto can _ in principle _ eliminate the bulk of this background , and one is left considering the perturbative corrections from virtual and soft real gluon emission .",
    "these have the same @xmath25 suppression as the leading - order contribution helicity projection .",
    "] however the perturbation series now contains large double logarithmic corrections @xmath26 at each order @xmath27 , which potentially can give sizable corrections .",
    "apart from their phenomenological importance , these logarithms are of theoretical interest .",
    "they do not have an obvious ` sudakov ' exponentiating behavior , arising from the fact that they originate in non - trivial regions of soft gluon phase space .",
    "furthermore , for any particular virtual gluon diagram they are mixed up with the genuine infra - red logarithms @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a fictitious gluon mass introduced to control the soft divergences .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the double logarithmic contributions were studied in considerable detail through two loops , i.e. up to and including @xmath30 contributions .",
    "inspection of the one - and two - loop coefficients led to the claim that , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the perturbation series was reasonably well approximated by the lowest two orders .",
    "however from both a theoretical and practical pont of view it is clearly desirable to have more information about the behavior of the double - logarithmic ( dl ) terms to all orders , in particular to see if resummation is possible .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "as we shall see , a careful study of all the relevant two- and three - loop diagrams _ does _ reveal the pattern of the dl terms , and allows the all - orders result to be derived and resummed .    in this paper",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the theoretical study of the origin and calculation of the dl terms . in a future paper",
    "we will investigate their numerical effect on realistic plc cross sections .",
    "we begin , in section  2 , by deriving the leading order result for the @xmath10 cross section , identifying the origin of the @xmath18 suppression . in section  3",
    "we discuss the structure of the one - loop corrections , show how the dl contributions arise , and compare these with the known one loop result @xcite .",
    "the main part of the paper is section  4 , where we calculate all three - loop dl contributions and deduce the all - orders result .",
    "section  5 contains a summary of our results .",
    "we begin with a rederivation of the underlying born process . recall that for an initial state with @xmath2 the cross section vanishes in the massless limit . in other words ,",
    "the background to the standard higgs production process via a fermion loop and subsequent decay into a @xmath33 or @xmath34 final state is suppressed by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "higher order radiative ( bremsstrahlung ) corrections remove this suppression in principle @xcite .",
    "one therefore needs to keep at least terms of @xmath36 in the calculation of the born amplitudes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppqqb ] .",
    "we are also only interested in the region of large scattering angle @xmath37 , which is the dominant event topology of the higgs signal @xcite .    keeping only terms of @xmath38",
    ", we find it convenient to separate out the mass dependence of the spinors according to @xcite @xmath39 where the spinors on the r.h.s .",
    "are massless and @xmath40 is an arbitrary reference four - momentum with @xmath41 .",
    "the separation of the mass terms then allows for the convenient usage of the polarization vector @xcite    @xmath42    where here we denote the arbitrary massless reference momentum by @xmath43 . in the following",
    "we will also use simply @xmath44 for an arbitrary fermion mass , as the results derived do not depend on any heavy quark approximation .",
    "it is understood that for any application , the relevant fermion masses for the background to higgs production below the @xmath45 threshold are the @xmath24- and @xmath46-quark masses . the cross section of the latter is enhanced by a relative factor of @xmath47 from the different charges of the quarks .    using the above notation we find for the born amplitude @xmath48 with an initial @xmath2 state : @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 the electromagnetic coupling with magnitude @xmath52 and @xmath37 the scattering angle .",
    "the kronecker-@xmath53 s allow for a non - zero contribution only in case all four helicities are the same .",
    "the result agrees with refs .",
    "@xcite up to @xmath54 and displays the somewhat surprising feature of a bosonic angular dependence ( as in bhabha scattering for instance ) , with no @xmath37-terms in the numerator .",
    "this feature leads one to suspect that by keeping only the mass term of the virtual fermion propagator , one should obtain eq .",
    "[ eq : ppqqb ] very easily . a detailed analysis of this contribution , however , yields : @xmath55 \\label{eq : ppqqbm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while it does not agree with the exact result in eq .",
    "[ eq : ppqqb ] , it is also evident that for small angles and high energies both solutions do agree .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that this feature holds also through one and two loops if one is interested only in the leading logarithmic accuracy at large angles .",
    "the reason for this seemingly contradictory behavior is that while the angle between the outgoing fermion ( antifermion ) and the beamline is large , the angle between the incoming photon and the emitted soft parton is small .",
    "therefore , while it is wrong to keep only the @xmath44-term in the propagator of the virtual fermion for the born amplitude , it actually _ does _ give the correct leading logarithmic structure of higher order contributions with a soft fermion line .    for higher order corrections",
    "it is also convenient to use the following expression for the @xmath2 @xmath56 amplitude : @xmath57    in the following we describe how to obtain the double logarithms in the one loop approximation and introduce the techniques applied in the later stages of the paper .",
    "at the one loop level , the only diagram that can contribute large double logarithms is the box diagram with a virtual gluon connecting the outgoing @xmath58 pair .",
    "while the general method of employing sudakov parametrizations and integrating over the perpendicular components of soft loop momenta is well known @xcite and has been used extensively @xcite , we still find it useful to briefly review some basic properties . in section [ sec : res ]",
    "we will also remark on some subtleties one encounters with higher order virtual corrections .",
    "large logarithms occur only when there are small and large scales connected in a feynman diagram . while the particular feynman diagram is gauge dependent , the leading logarithmic contribution is not . in our case , the box diagram is connected with vertex and self energy corrections to form a gauge invariant cross section .",
    "however , in any gauge only the four - point diagram can yield the desired pair of large logarithms .",
    "it is therefore independent of the particular choice of gauge .",
    "a familiar and analogous example of the same mechanism is the gauge invariance of the infra red @xmath59 term in the context of dimensional regularization for a massless box diagram .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] we list the four distinct topologies that allow a doubly logarithmic contribution from the box diagram .",
    "the `` blob '' always denotes a hard momentum flowing through the omitted propagator and in each case there is a corresponding soft momentum flowing through the propagator facing the hard blob .",
    "the feature which makes this process interesting and very different from the standard sudakov form factor is the fact that we have soft _ fermion _ contributions as well .",
    "`` soft '' means in this context soft compared to the hard blob .",
    "the sudakov decomposition of loop momenta should be chosen such that the external four momenta joining the soft parton line are used as the base vectors . and can lead to technical difficulties . ] for the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] , however , we take :    @xmath60    at large angles and in the doubly logarithmic ( dl ) approximation , we have @xmath61    the phase space for the large logarithms is given by @xmath62 , with @xmath63    the integrations over the transverse momenta of the soft particles is performed by taking half of the residues in the corresponding propagators : @xmath64    the dl - contribution of a particular feynman diagram is thus given by @xmath65 where the @xmath66 are given by integrals over the remaining sudakov parameters at the @xmath27-loop level : @xmath67    the factors @xmath68 are specific to the given feynman diagram and contain its color factors and the restrictions on the occurring sudakov variables necessary to ensure that the matrix element has logarithmic behavior in each of them .",
    "the range of integration is restricted by demanding that there is at least one pole term on the opposite side of the contour of integration from the other propagator terms , since cauchy s theorem would otherwise give a vanishing contribution .",
    "as a simple example , we now apply the above techniques to the one loop diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] . for the standard infrared form factor of topology @xmath69",

    "the fact that the born amplitude factors out is trivial for topology @xmath69 . for topologies",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 the exact numerator factorization was derived in ref . @xcite . in the former ,",
    "it is connected with the aforementioned purely bosonic angular dependence of @xmath56 of eq .",
    "[ eq : ppqqb ] , as it contains a hard subprocess @xmath75 . in the latter",
    ", one needs to exploit the dirac equation and gauge invariance in order to factor out the hard subprocess @xmath76 and the born amplitude .",
    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "with these results , we can now proceed to investigate the higher order structure of the leading logarithmic corrections from insertions of multiple gluons in the basic contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] .",
    "the next section gives explicit results through three loops which enable us to arrive at an all orders resummation of both hard as well as soft logarithmic corrections .",
    "in this section we derive the expressions for the leading logarithmic corrections to all orders for the @xmath2 initial state @xmath77 process .",
    "while it is possible to rigorously derive these corrections to all orders for topologies @xmath69 and @xmath71 , for topology @xmath72 only the new hard `` non - sudakov '' logarithms can be treated analytically . for soft insertions",
    "we derive explicit three loop results and show that essentially the same factorization structure emerges as in @xmath71 . this behavior",
    "is then extrapolated to all orders .    at this point",
    "we note that we have recalculated the virtual two loop corrections presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and agree with their results . in the following ,",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to a discussion of the three loop level .",
    "all resummed formulae were checked explicitly through one- , two- and three - loops .",
    "we begin with the sudakov form factor of topology @xmath69 . at three loops ,",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3ls ] .",
    "the summation is analogous to the soft vertex corrections where the exponentiation to all orders for a color singlet final state was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite to leading order by employing an asymptotic hamiltonian as well as the coherent state formalism .",
    "explicit three loop calculations were performed in the leading logarithmic approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite and related work can also be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for all orders corrections to topology @xmath69",
    "we thus find the familiar result : @xmath78    the non - abelian color factors of diagrams with an `` abelian '' topology are canceled by the contributions of the purely non - abelian topologies . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that for the three gluon vertex coupling , there is an effective factor of @xmath79 stemming from two contributions in numerator terms that are needed to obtain the required number of logarithms .",
    "this is only the case if one has a denominator of the type @xmath80 . for one gluon very soft ,",
    "there is a term @xmath81 and one @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the other ( relatively ) soft gluon momentum and @xmath84 an external hard fermion momentum .",
    "the lorentz structure of the three gluon vertex is such that only these two terms give dl - contributions ( the third connects the same fermion line ) .",
    "the effective soft contribution is therefore @xmath85 , compared with a factor @xmath86 from the emission of a soft gluon off a fermion line .      the interesting feature of the higher order corrections to the one - loop diagrams of fig . [ fig:1l ]",
    "is that there are novel purely hard `` non - sudakov '' logarithms due to the presence of the `` soft '' fermion line in topologies @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in the case where a gluon insertion does not end on an external ( hard ) fermion line ,",
    "the soft fermion line serves essentially as a cutoff for gluons that are soft compared to the hard blob .",
    "the diagrams are listed in figs .",
    "[ fig : b3l ] and [ fig : c3l ] and denoted by @xmath87 , as they contain no soft sudakov contributions .",
    "besides a different color factor , both contributions are identical and lead to the same structure as in the soft case , except for the last two integrations .",
    "they have the additional effect of eliminating @xmath88 terms , which are very important in the soft case ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spsp ] ) .",
    "the reason is simply that they are automatically fulfilled since the soft fermion line induces a @xmath89 cutoff for the soft gluon sudakov variables .",
    "the integrations over the gluonic variables can thus be performed easily and summing over @xmath90 gluon insertions we have : @xmath91    using partial integration @xmath90-times ( differentiating @xmath92 , integrating @xmath93 ) , we find :    @xmath94 ^ 1_\\frac{m^2}{s } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\sum^\\infty_{i=0 } \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi } \\right)^{i+1 } \\frac{(-1)^i \\ ; \\gamma ( i+1)}{\\gamma ( 2i+3 ) }   \\log^{2i+2 } \\frac{m^2}{s } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi } \\log^2 \\frac{m^2}{s } \\ ; _ 2f_2 ( 1,1;2,\\frac{3}{2 } ;   -\\frac{\\alpha_s}{8\\pi }   \\log^2 \\frac{m^2}{s } ) \\label{eq : hff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to compare this result with the known one- and two - loop leading logarithmic results we list them below explicitly and find agreement with refs .",
