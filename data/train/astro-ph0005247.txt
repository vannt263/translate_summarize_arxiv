    "since the identification of the first quasar redshift ( 3c 273 , @xcite ) , quasars have been at the forefront of modern cosmology . with luminosities tens or hundreds of times",
    "higher than those of galaxies , quasars are a powerful probe of the distant primordial universe . over the past decade",
    "approximately two hundred objects above redshift four have been discovered , and there is a growing consensus that the number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts of two and three and steeply declines out to the limits of current measurements ( @xmath8 ; see warren , hewett , & osmer 1994 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies ( @xcite,2000 ) have dramatically increased the number of known quasars with redshifts larger than  4.5 , opening the possibility of investigating the quasar luminosity function at redshift five and beyond ; this information will determine whether the number density of quasars continues to decline with increasing redshift , or whether theoretical models ( @xmath9 @xcite ) that predict a significant number of quasars at @xmath10 are correct .",
    "the majority of high - redshift quasars have been identified by optical color selection . as the result of intergalactic absorption",
    ", the flux in the spectral region shortward of  in distant objects is significantly attenuated .",
    "the onset of the  forest and the lyman break can be detected with broad - band imaging .",
    "multicolor optical surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have proven effective in identifying @xmath11 quasars , but as most such surveys lack information redward of the @xmath12 band , they have difficulty distinguishing between quasars at redshifts larger than @xmath13 4.8 and cool stars . recently",
    ", the commissioning data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) have led to the identification of new high - redshift quasars at an unprecedented rate : approximately 45 quasars at @xmath14 ( two at @xmath15 , @xcite,2000 ; @xcite ) , have been published in the past two years .",
    "these quasars , at @xmath16 , are at the luminous end of the quasar luminosity distribution .",
    "( throughout this paper cosmological properties are calculated assuming and  @xmath17  =  0.5 . )    in addition to wide area surveys , color selection for high - redshift objects has been applied to small , deep fields .",
    "three galaxies at @xmath18 have been spectroscopically confirmed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and recently @xcite found an agn ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath20 . the hubble deep field has led to the discovery of high - redshift candidates ( @xmath21 6 - 10 , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; these objects , however , are orders of magnitude less luminous than quasars , and their spectral properties are difficult to study even with the world s largest telescopes .",
    "although the @xmath22 barrier was broken more than two years ago , objects at these extreme redshifts are still rare enough that each new example is a potentially valuable probe of the very early universe .",
    "this is especially true in the case of the most luminous quasars , since follow - up spectroscopy of these relatively bright objects can reveal information about the physical conditions in early quasars and about the state of the intergalactic medium at very high redshifts .",
    "the sdss collaboration has undertaken extensive efforts to search for high - redshift quasars . in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of five quasars at @xmath23 , of which the most distant is at @xmath24 .",
    "the sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) utilizes a wide - field camera with 54 ccds ( @xcite ) , mounted on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory ( apo ) , new mexico , to survey @xmath13  @xmath25 steradians of the sky around the northern galactic cap .",
    "ccd images in five broad optical bands ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath1 , centered at 3540   , 4770   , 6230   , 7630    and  9130    ; @xcite ) yield a nominal @xmath30 detection of point sources in ab magnitudes of 22.3 , 23.3 , 23.1 , 22.3 , and 20.8 , respectively .",
    "the commissioning data have so far covered @xmath31 square degrees , mostly near the equatorial region , @xmath32 .    with five bands and a spectral resolution of @xmath33",
    ", the sdss imaging data can distinguish quasars from stars in a broad redshift range ( @xcite ) . at @xmath34 , quasars lie well away from the stellar locus in the @xmath35 color space , due to the large equivalent width of the  emission line and the significant absorption produced by the  forest and lyman limit systems . at redshifts between 4.4 and 5 ,",
    "the @xmath36 color becomes large , and @xmath37 is near zero . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the flux drop shortward of the redshifted  emission line affects the @xmath29-band magnitude , and the @xmath37 color increases with redshift . at this point",
    "the quasar track quickly approaches the red end of the stellar locus in the @xmath39 color diagram ; the rise in contamination by very cool stars requires that additional discriminators be added to aid the quasar selection . for quasars , the underlying continuum longward of can be approximated with a power law ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of @xmath40 , leading to a small color differences in bands located redward of the  emission line this small color difference contrasts sharply with the colors of most cool stars ( @xcite , 2000 ) , whose flux rises rapidly towards longer wavelengths .",
    "our target selection is based on three regions in sdss color space : ( 1 ) @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; or ( 3 ) @xmath1-band detection only , i.e. @xmath45 and the detection in the other four bands is below @xmath46 .",
    "if an object s @xmath28 or @xmath29 magnitude is below the respective @xmath30 detection level , we use the latter in calculating the color in case ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "( note the @xmath47 superscript for the magnitudes ; the measurements reported here are based on a preliminary calibrations of the sdss photometric system . ) in addition , an object must be classified as a point source by the sdss processing software and have to be included as a quasar candidate .",
    "we applied these selection criteria to @xmath48 square degrees of sdss imaging data acquired in 1999 march and 2000 february .",
    "the selection criteria used here differ from those employed by fan et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) to identify @xmath49 quasars . whereas fan et al .",
    "required @xmath50 , candidates in this paper can be undetected in the @xmath29 band .",
    "the flux measurements for this paper s candidates often have lower signal - to - noise ratio , and a sample drawn from these selection criteria will naturally be more susceptible to contamination from non - quasars than those in fan et al .",
    "the color cuts in this paper are closer to the stellar locus than the fan et al .",
    "criteria ; this will also resultin a reduction in the selection efficiency",
    ".    we obtained ir photometry of quasar candidates in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) at mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the observations were taken on 2000 march 9 - 12 using the nsfcam equipped with a 256@xmath51256 insb array .",
    "the plate scale was 030 pixel@xmath52 , and the seeing was @xmath5312 in the @xmath5-band .",
    "each selected target was imaged with standard dithering technique with total exposure times of 7 min and 5 min in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "images of ir standard stars were taken throughout the observations to monitor the magnitude zero points .",
    "typical photometric errors are in the 0.05 - 0.1 magnitude range , depending on the brightness of objects ; see @xcite for details of the observations and data calibration .",
    "we observed @xmath54 known sdss quasars with redshifts greater than 4 to empirically calibrate our selection technique .",
    "our additional color constraints are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "approximately ten such objects whose colors closely resembled those of known quasars were selected .",
    "note that four of the five quasars are at redshift smaller than 5 , and they can be selected by the sdss data alone ( @xcite , 2000 ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations of sdss high - redshift quasar candidates were carried out in 2000 february and march , with the digital imaging spectrograph ( dis ) of the apo 3.5 m telescope .",
    "the dis is a double spectrograph ; for high - redshift quasars , only the red part of the low - resolution spectrum , covering the wavelength range 5400    to 10000    at 13    resolution , contained any useful signal .",
    "the exposure time for each object was 30 minutes ; even with a limited signal - to - noise ratio in the spectra , the redshift identifications , based on the strong , asymmetric  emission line and absorption produced by the  forest , are unambiguous .",
    "the observations in february were made before the irtf run .",
    "of the six candidates , only one , sdss  1129@xmath570142 , turned out to be a quasar .",
    "the j2000 coordinates are given in the object name ( format see @xcite . ) for brevity , we have shortened the names to sdss  hhmm+ddmm throughout the text . ) in late march we observed five sdss / ir candidates , and two , sdss  1021@xmath570309 and sdss  1208 + 0010 , are quasars .    after the initial identification with the apo data , additional spectroscopic observations of the three quasars were obtained in 2000  april with the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; @xcite , @xcite ) at the prime focus of the hobby - eberly telescope ( @xcite ) at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the lrs configuration of a 2@xmath58 slit , 300  line  mm@xmath52 grating , and og515 blocking filter produced spectra with a wavelength coverage of 5150    to 10,150    at a resolution of  20   .",
    "the exposure times were typically  30  minutes .",
    "two additional sdss / ir quasar candidates were observed with the keck 10 m telescope on april 5 - 6 , and both of them , sdss  1451@xmath570104 and sdss  1122@xmath570229 , are quasars .",
    "the spectra were taken with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi , @xcite ) on the keck observatory 10-m telescope .",
    "the esi was used in high dispersion mode which covers the wavelength range of 4000 to 11000   with 11  resolution .",
    "the quasars were viewed through a 1wide slit oriented at the parallactic angle .",
    "the exposure time is 20 minutes each .",
    "the @xmath24 quasar , sdss 1208 + 0010 , was also observed for 30 minutes .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated relative to the standard star g191b2b .",
    "the spectra were extracted and reduced using standard iraf programs , and binned to 3.85 .",
    "only one of the five  non - infrared \" candidates , observed in february , is a quasar .",
    "of the seven sdss / ir candidates observed , four are quasars , while the other are late - type stars .",
    "this result tentatively suggests that ir selection may significantly improve the selection efficiency , but clearly a larger sample is needed to confirm this conclusion .",
    "table  1 lists the optical / ir photometric measurements .",
    "the quasar spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "2 , with prominent spectral features marked .",
    "all the spectra have been placed on an absolute flux scale by matching the @xmath59 magnitudes in table  1 with the @xmath59 magnitudes synthesized from the spectrum .",
    "the keck and het spectra of sdss  1208 + 0010 reveal the  emission at @xmath60 , which is not clear in the data taken at apo .",
    "table  2 contains the redshift ( see notes below for the specifics of the measurements for each object ) , ab@xmath61 ( the ab magnitude of the quasar at 1450    in the rest frame , corrected for galactic absorption ) , the power law index of the continuum , the continuum depression due to absorption in the  and  regions ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; see @xcite ) , and the absolute @xmath64 magnitude of the quasars .",
    "the galactic extinction is calculated using the reddening map of @xcite .",
    "the luminosities for the quasars were calculated assuming that the continuum power law slope from the far ultraviolet to the optical was  @xmath65 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the individual power law slopes , and hence the depression estimates , are quite uncertain given the limited baseline available in the spectra and the presence of bal features .",
    "all are moderately luminous quasars , and the spectra of three contain bal features .",
    "each spectrum contains at least one excellent candidate for a damped  system , and there is no detected flux below the rest frame lyman limit in any of the quasars .    as shown in figure 2 , the extent of intergalactic absorption shortward of the redshifted  emission increases from @xmath66 to @xmath24 .",
    "this is reflected in the continuum depression values in table 2 .",
    "however , the residual flux can be seen in all the spectra , particularly around the ovi+feature , suggesting that the intergalactic medium is not completely opaque .",
    "our measurements are consistent with the known distributions of the forest absorption as derived at lower redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "* sdss 1021@xmath570309 * ( @xmath6 = 4.70 ) : the sharp split of the and nv  lines may suggest unusually strong nv  emission . a simple fit to a 300- region longward of the  cutoff yields a nv/  ratio of 0.64 for the narrow features .",
    "if the split is a result of nv  absorption , the corresponding wavelength for the  absorption counterpart should be centered at @xmath67 . while a significant  bal trough is present in the spectrum , it is centered at @xmath68 .",
    "the redshift determined by the oi , siiv+oiv ] , and  emission lines are consistent with each other at the  0.005 level .",
    "the  and nv  emission shows redshifts that are consistent ( with slightly larger errors ) with the other lines .",
    "* sdss 1122@xmath570229 * ( @xmath6 = 4.80 ) : this object has the strongest emission lines among the five . the measurements of , oi , nv  and emission yields a redshift of @xmath69 . the  absorption cutoff is not as sharp as the others , stretching @xmath70  with several narrow absorption troughs .    *",
    "sdss 1129@xmath570142 * ( @xmath6 = 4.85 ) : this quasar is slightly more luminous than 3c  273 , which in the adopted cosmology is @xmath71 .",
    "it displays a number of spectacular bal features ; because of this , many of the properties given in table  2 contain large uncertainties .",
    "strong , broad troughs of  and siiv+oiv ]  dominate the spectrum , and there is a suggestion of the presence of oi  and nv  absorption features .",
    "the redshift is based on assigning a rest wavelength of  1219    to the peak of the  emission line ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the observed values of the continuum depression are exceptionally large ; this almost certainly arises from significant intrinsic absorption .    *",
    "sdss 1208 + 0010 * ( @xmath6 = 5.27 ) : very strong , relatively narrow  and nv  emission dominate the spectrum ; this spectrum bears an uncanny resemblance to that of the @xmath72 quasar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nv , oi , and  lines yield a consistent redshift ; the peak of the  feature occurs at  1218   , typical for quasars at redshifts above four ( @xcite ) .",
    "the depression due to the  forest ( see table  2 ) is quite large , but not unusual for this redshift , suggesting that there is not a dramatic change in the character in the  forest from lower redshifts to at least @xmath73 .    *",
    "sdss 1451@xmath570104 * ( @xmath6 = 4.67 ) : the redshifts determined from the peaks of  and siiv+oiv ]  match that of the  edge within 0.005 . a significant",
    ", broad absorption trough is present between @xmath74 .",
    "the discovery of these quasars once again demonstrates the ability of the sdss to effectively identify @xmath23 quasars , and extends the sdss redshift range to well beyond five . by supplementing the sdss measurements with @xmath4 and @xmath5 photometry , we have been able to efficiently identify ( success rate of @xmath13 50% ) high - redshift quasars in magnitude / color space regions that are fainter and closer to the stellar locus than were presented in fan et al .",
    "( 1999,2000 ) ; it is likely that ir photometry will be a valuable tool in the search for faint , @xmath75 quasars .",
    "our ir photometry is only a test , and the results do not constitute a complete sample .",
    "to date the sdss has imaged but a few percent of the planned survey area ; based on the results to date , the complete survey should contain well over a hundred @xmath76 quasars found with well - defined selection criteria .",
