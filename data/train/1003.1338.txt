    "euler s equations for irrotational incompressible ideal fluid motion under gravity with a free surface have an asymptotic expansion for shallow water waves that contains two small parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with ordering @xmath5 .",
    "these small parameters are @xmath6 ( the ratio of wave amplitude to mean depth ) and @xmath7 ( the squared ratio of mean depth to horizontal length , or wavelength ) .",
    "euler s equations are made non - dimensional by introducing @xmath8 for horizontal position , @xmath9 for vertical position , @xmath10 for time , @xmath11 for surface elevation and @xmath12 for velocity potential , where @xmath13 is the mean wave speed and @xmath14 is the constant gravity .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the dimensionless bond number , in which @xmath16 is the mass density of the fluid and @xmath17 is its surface tension , both of which are taken to be constants . after dropping primes ,",
    "this asymptotic expansion yields the nondimensional korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation for the horizontal velocity variable @xmath18 at _ linear _ order in the small dimensionless ratios @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as the left hand side of @xmath19 here , partial derivatives are denoted using subscripts , and boundary conditions are @xmath20 and @xmath21 at spatial infinity on the real line .",
    "the famous @xmath22 traveling wave solutions ( the solitons ) for kdv ( [ kdv - eqn ] ) arise in a balance between its ( weakly ) nonlinear steepening and its third - order linear dispersion , when the quadratic terms in @xmath3 and @xmath4 on its right hand side are neglected .    on the right hand side of equation ( [ kdv - eqn ] ) ,",
    "a normal form transformation due to kodama @xcite has been used to remove the other possible quadratic terms of order @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining quadratic correction terms in the kdv equation ( [ kdv - eqn ] ) may be collected at order @xmath25 .",
    "these terms may be expressed , after introducing a `` momentum variable , '' @xmath26 and neglecting terms of _ cubic _ order in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as @xmath27 in the momentum variable @xmath28 , the parameter @xmath29 is given by @xcite @xmath30 thus , the effects of @xmath31dispersion also enter the nonlinear terms . after restoring dimensions in equation ( [ b - eqn ] ) and rescaling velocity @xmath32 by @xmath33 , the following  @xmath34-equation \" emerges , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dimensional momentum variable , and the constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 are squares of length scales .",

    "any value of the parameter @xmath40 may be achieved in equation ( [ dim - b - eqn ] ) by an appropriate kodama transformation @xcite .",
    "as we have emphasized , the values of the coefficients in the asymptotic analysis of shallow water waves at quadratic order in their two small parameters only hold , modulo the kodama normal - form transformations .",
    "hence , these transformations may be used to advance the analysis and thereby gain insight , by optimizing the choices of these coefficients .",
    "the freedom introduced by the kodama transformations among asymptotically equivalent equations at quadratic order in @xmath3 and @xmath4 also helps to answer the perennial question , `` why are integrable equations so ubiquitous when one uses asymptotics in modeling ? ''",

    "camassa and holm @xcite also discovered the remarkable peaked soliton ( peakon ) solutions of ( [ singlepeakon - soln],[peakontrain - soln ] ) for the ch equation on the real line , given by ( [ dim - b - eqn ] ) in the case @xmath41 .",
    "the peakons arise as solutions of ( [ dim - b - eqn ] ) , when @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the absence of linear dispersion .",

    "@xcite took advantage of the parametric freedom in the kodama normal - form transformations of the asymptotic expansion results at quadratic order .",
    "the effects of the parameter @xmath34 on the solutions of equation ( [ dim - b - eqn ] ) were investigated in holm and staley @xcite , where @xmath34 was treated as a bifurcation parameter , in the limiting case when the linear dispersion coefficients are set to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this limiting case allows a variety of special solutions for different ranges of the values of @xmath34 , in which the two nonlinear terms in equation ( [ dim - b - eqn ] ) balance each other in the _ absence _ of linear dispersion .",
    "since its first appearance in @xcite , the ch equation has been the centre of a confluence of scientific endeavors that includes water waves , integrable systems , pde analysis , asymptotics , geometry and lie groups . this confluence has led to a continued interest and opportunities for contributions from many different fields in mathematics .",
    "the interest in ch solutions may be measured by noticing that the entry ` peakon ' has acquired many thousands of _ google hits_.      this paper aims to review some of the geometric highlights of recent work on the ch equation .",
    "it is certainly not exhaustive .",
    "it mainly focuses on comparing the soliton theory for smooth ch solutions with the peakon theory for its singular solutions in the dispersionless limit .",
    "section [ ist - sec ] briefly explains the application of the method of the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) for obtaining the soliton solutions of ch equation .",
    "the set of scattering data is introduced and the formulation of the inverse scattering as a riemann - hilbert problem is outlined . the solution is expressed via the scattering data in a form that admits the peakon limit in the sections that follow . in section [ mommap - sec ]",
    "the map between the action - angle variables ( expressed via the scattering data ) and the momentum of the ch solution is formulated as a momentum map from the symplectic action - angle variables to the dual of the lie algebra of smooth vector fields on the real line .",
    "this is a poisson map , but the noncanonical bi - hamiltonian structure of the ch equation which led to the discovery of its isospectral problem in @xcite and its geometrical significance as geodesic flow on the diffeomorphism group are not discussed here . in section [ peakon - sec ]",
    "we introduce the peakons as singular solutions that appear in dispersionless limit .",

    "these also allow for singular solutions .",
    "although such multidimensional generalizations are unlikely to be integrable , numerical studies show that their solutions are stable and interact elastically in collisions . in section [ conclus - sec ]",
    "we comment briefly on some limitations of our present discussion and point out three open problems for further research .",
    "one of the most significant results in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations was the development of gardner , greene , kruskal and miura @xcite of a method for the exact solution of the initial - value problem for the kdv equation .",
    "prior to their work the only known exact solutions of kdv were the travelling wave solutions .",

    "xx&+ & u= + _ t&=&(u_x+)-(4 + 2u)_x    where @xmath52 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the method is conceptually analogous in many ways to the fourier transform method for solving linear equations .",
    "this method is now known as inverse scattering transform ( ist ) .",
    "it was recast by lax @xcite in a general framework that allows the ist to be used for solving other nonlinear pdes .",
    "an important consequence is the relationship between the discrete eigenvalues and the characteristics of the solitons that emerge asymptotically .",
    "another feature of soliton collisions is the preservation of soliton identities after the interaction ( asymptotically in time ) .",
    "for example , collisions of kdv solitons only result in a phase shift from the positions where they would have been without the interaction .",
    "the kdv was formulated as a completely integrable hamiltonian system in a work by faddeev and zakharov @xcite , the hamiltonian form was also noted by gardner @xcite .    reviews of ist may be found , for example , in ablowitz et al .",

    "an attempt at developing the inverse scattering theory for this case has been made by kaup @xcite , who suggested applying the inverse scattering approach separately in each interval where @xmath274 is of the same sign .",
    "the problem however is how to join solutions that are valid in different intervals .",
    "the peakon solution ( [ m_i ] ) was obtained from the soliton solution under the assumption @xmath273 .",
    "thus , all @xmath275 are of the same sign , since all the eigenvalues @xmath133 in this case are positive .",
    "however , one can formally use the same solution with eigenvalues of various signs to model @xmath275 of various signs ( mixture of peakons and ` anti - peakons ' ) and thus to study peakon ",
    "anti - peakon interactions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the result is that the multi - peakon interaction ( including anti - peakons ) in general decomposes into a sequence of pairwise collisions @xcite .",
    "the collision of a single peakon - anti - peakon pair was studied already in @xcite . when the eigenvalues are of mixed signs , the hankel determinants in the denominator of ( [ m_i ] )",
    "may develop singularities for finite values of @xmath60 .",
    "this ` peakon - breaking ' phenomenon is apparently the analog of the wave - breaking mentioned earlier when @xmath276 .",
    "this needs to be investigated further .",
