    "the radiative decays of light vector mesons @xmath4 into a pair of neutral pseudoscalars @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are an excellent laboratory for investigating the nature and extracting the properties of the light scalar meson resonances @xmath7 .",
    "particularly interesting are the so called _ golden processes _ , namely @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which , as we will see , can provide us with valuable information on the properties of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath1 , the first measurements of this decay have been reported by the snd and cmd-2 collaborations . for the branching ratio they obtain @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite , for @xmath13 mev in the latter case .",
    "more recently , the kloe collaboration has measured @xmath14 @xcite . in all the cases ,",
    "the spectrum is clearly peaked at @xmath15 mev , as expected from an important @xmath8 contribution .    for @xmath2 ,",
    "the branching ratios measured by the snd , cmd-2 and kloe collaborations are @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , and @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "again , in all the cases , the observed mass spectrum shows a significant enhancement at large @xmath22 invariant mass that is interpreted as a manifestation of the dominant contribution of the @xmath23 intermediate state .    for @xmath3 , the snd coll .",
    "has measured @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this value can be explained by means of a significant contribution of the @xmath25 intermediate state together with the well - known @xmath26 contribution .",
    "a first attempt to explain the @xmath6 decays was done in ref .",
    "@xcite using the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model . in this framework",
    ", the @xmath6 decays proceed through the decay chain @xmath27 .",
    "the calculated branching ratios @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite are found to be substantially smaller than the experimental results .",
    "later on , the @xmath6 decays were studied in a chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) context enlarged to included on - shell vector mesons @xcite . in this formalism ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "taking into account both chiral and vmd contributions , one finally obtains @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite , which are still below the experimental results .",
    "additional contributions are thus certainly required and the most natural candidates are the contributions coming from the exchange of scalar resonances .",
    "a first model including the scalar resonances explicitly is the _ no structure model _",
    ", where the @xmath6 decays proceed through the decay chain @xmath37 and the coupling @xmath38 is considered as pointlike .",
    "this model is ruled out by experimental data on @xmath1 decays @xcite .",
    "a second model is the _ kaon loop model _ @xcite , where the initial vector decays into a pair of charged kaons that , after the emission of a photon , rescatter into a pair of neutral pseudoscalars through the exchange of scalar resonances .",
    "the previous two models include the scalar resonances _ ad hoc _ , and the pseudoscalar rescattering amplitudes are not chiral invariant .",
    "this problem is solved in the next two models which are based not only on the _ kaon loop model _ but also on chiral symmetry .",
    "the first one is the unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( uchpt ) where the scalar resonances are generated dynamically by unitarizing the one - loop pseudoscalar amplitudes . in this approach , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the second model is the linear sigma model ( l@xmath42 m ) , a well - defined @xmath43 chiral model which incorporates _ ab initio _ the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons nonets .",
    "the advantage of the l@xmath42 m is to incorporate explicitly the effects of scalar meson poles while keeping the correct behaviour at low invariant masses expected from chpt .    in the next three sections ,",
    "we discuss the scalar contributions to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays in the framework of the l@xmath42 m .",
    "the scalar contribution to this process is driven by the decay chain @xmath44 . the contribution from pion loops",
    "is known to be negligible due to the zweig rule .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath45 is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the dipion invariant mass and @xmath49 is a loop integral function .",
