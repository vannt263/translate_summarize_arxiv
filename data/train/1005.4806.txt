    "the quantity @xmath14 $ ] becomes additive over the regenerative set @xmath18 enabling us to prove , under the stronger condition @xmath21 a ( functional ) central limit theorem .",
    "the latter condition implies finiteness of variance of the longest path between two successive points of @xmath18 . to prove the latter assertion",
    ", we provide a rather non - trivial algorithmic construction of the last non - positive element of @xmath18 .",
    "this construction is related to the so - called coupling - from - the past method for perfect simulation @xcite and is the topic of section [ algo ] which is based on the properties of two stopping times studied in section [ twos ] .",
    "the central limit theorem is proved in section [ clt ] .",
