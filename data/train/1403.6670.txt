    "@xcite have become a paradigmatic issue in the interplay between nonequilibrium systems and complex networks  @xcite , being the epidemic spreading a prominent example where high complexity emerges from very simple dynamical rules on heterogeneous substrates  @xcite .",
    "the existence or absence of finite epidemic thresholds involving an endemic phase of the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model on scale - free ( sf ) networks with a degree distribution @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the degree exponent , has been target of a recent and intense investigation  @xcite . in the sis epidemic model , individuals can only be in one of two states : infected or susceptible .",
    "infected individuals become spontaneously healthy at rate @xmath3 ( this choice fixes the time scale ) , while the susceptible ones are infected at rate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of infected contacts of a vertex @xmath6 .",
    "distinct theoretical approaches for the sis model were devised to determine an epidemic threshold @xmath7 separating an absorbing , disease - free state from an active phase  @xcite . the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory  @xcite explicitly includes the entire structure of the network through its adjacency matrix while the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory  @xcite performs a coarse - graining of the network grouping vertices accordingly their degrees .",
    "the hmf theory predicts a vanishing threshold for the sis model for the range @xmath8 while a finite threshold is expected for @xmath0 .",

    "et al_.  @xcite proposed that qmf theory predicts the threshold for an endemic phase , in which a finite fraction of the network is infected , only if the principal eigenvector of adjacency matrix is delocalized . in the case of a localized principal eigenvector , that usually happens for large random networks with @xmath0  @xcite , the epidemic threshold is associated to the eigenvalue of the first delocalized eigenvector . for @xmath9 , there exists a consensus for sis thresholds : both hmf and qmf are equivalent and accurate for @xmath10 while qmf works better for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that for a range @xmath12 with a nonzero @xmath7 , the hubs in a random network become infected generating epidemic activity in their neighborhoods but high - degree vertices produce independent active domains only when they are not directly connected .",
    "these independent domains were classified as rare - regions , in which activity can last for very long times ( increasing exponentially with the domain size  @xcite ) , generating griffiths phases ( gps )  @xcite",
    ". the sizes of these active domains increase for increasing @xmath13 leading to the overlap among them and , finally , to an endemic phase for @xmath14 .",
    "however , on networks where almost all hubs are directly connected , it is possible to sustain an endemic state even in the limit @xmath15 due to the mutual reinfection of connected hubs . inspired in the appealing arguments of lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , bogu , castellano and pastor - satorras ( bcps )  @xcite proposed a semi - analytical approach taking into account a long - range reinfection mechanism and found a vanishing epidemic threshold for @xmath0 .",
    "they compared their theoretical predictions with simulations starting from a single infected vertex and a diverging epidemic lifespan was used as a criterion to determine the thresholds .",
    "however , the applicability of bcps theory to determine a phase transition involving an endemic phase has been debated  @xcite .    in this work , we performed extensive simulations and found that the sis dynamics on sf networks with exponent @xmath0 can exhibit multiple transitions , with multiple thresholds , .",
    "thresholds consistent with those predicted by qmf , hmf and bcps theories were found in our analysis .",
    "moreover , our finds indicate that the vanishing thresholds , as those predicted by qmf  @xcite and bcps theories  @xcite , involve long - term but still localized epidemics rather than an endemic state , in which a finite fraction of the network has non - vanishing probability to be infected in the thermodynamic limit . we propose that this localized long - term epidemics takes place in domains involving a hubs with very large degree and their nearest - neighbors .",
    "finally , our numerical results show a transition to the endemic state occurring at a finite threshold , which is intriguingly well described by the classic and simpler hmf theory  @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec . [",
    "sec : simulations ] we present simulation procedures , discuss important technical details of the quasistationary ( qs ) method used in this work and provide a comparison between qs method and the lifespan simulation method proposed in ref .",
    "section [ sec : results ] is devoted to describe the numerical results obtained from qs simulations and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our concluding remarks .",
    "finally , an example where the lifespan method does not determine the endemic phase in systems with multiple transitions while the qs method does is presented in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we implement the sis model using a : at each time step , the number of infected nodes @xmath16 and edges emanating from them @xmath17 are computed and time is incremented by .",
    "however , this stochasticity in time increment did not play an important rule in our analysis due to the large averaging used . ]",
    "with probability @xmath19 one infected node is selected at random and becomes susceptible . with the complementary probability @xmath20",
    "an infection attempt is performed in two steps : ( i ) a infected vertex @xmath21 is selected with probability proportional to its degree .",
    "( ii ) a nearest neighbor of @xmath21 is selected with equal chance and , if susceptible , is infected .",
    "if the chosen neighbor is infected nothing happens and simulation runs to the next time step .",
    "notice that @xmath22 is the total infection rate emanating from infected vertices and the frustrated attempts compensate this exceeding rate .",
    "the numbers of infected nodes and related links are updated accordingly , and the whole process is iterated .",
    "the simulations were performed using the qs method  @xcite that , to our knowledge , is the most robust approach to overcome the difficulties intrinsic to the stationary simulations of finite systems with absorbing states . in this method , every time the system tries to visit an absorbing state it jumps to an active configuration previously visited during the simulation ( a new initial condition ) .",
    "this method reproduces very accurately the standard qs method where averages are performed only over samples that did not visit the absorbing state  @xcite and its convergence to the real qs state was proved  @xcite . to implement the method ,",
    "a list containing @xmath23 configurations is stored and constantly updated .",
    "the updating is done by randomly picking up a stored configuration and replacing it by the current one with probability @xmath24 .",
    "we fixed @xmath25 since no significant dependence on this parameter was detected for a wide range of simulation parameters . after a relaxation time @xmath26 , the averages are computed over a time @xmath27 .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time is always short for epidemics on random networks due to the very small average shortest path  @xcite .",
    "typically , a qs state is reached for @xmath28 for the simulation parameters investigated .",
    "so , we used @xmath29 . the averaging time , on the other hand , must be large enough to guaranty that epidemics over the whole network was suitably averaged .",
    "it means that very long times are required for very low qs density ( sub - critical phase in phase transition jargon ) whereas relatively short times are sufficient for high density states . since long times are computationally prohibitive for highly infected qs states , we used averaging times from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , being the larger the average time the smaller the infection rate .",
    "notice that the simulation time step becomes tiny for a very supercritical system ( large number of infected vertices ) and a huge number of configurations are visited during a unity of time .",
    "it is important to notice that the qs method becomes expendable for a large part of our simulations since the system never visits the absorbing state for the considered simulation times .",
    "both equilibrium and non - equilibrium critical phenomena are hallmarked by simultaneous diverging correlation length and time , which microscopically reflect the divergence of the spatial and temporal fluctuations  @xcite , respectively .",
    "even tough a diverging correlation length has little sense on complex networks due to the small - world property  @xcite , the diverging temporal fluctuation concept is still applicable .",
    "we used different criteria to determine the thresholds , relied on the fluctuations or singularities of the order parameters , as explained below .",
    "the qs probability @xmath32 , defined as the probability that the system has @xmath33 occupied vertices in the qs regime , is computed during the averaging time and basic qs quantities , as lifespan and density of infected vertices , are derived form @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "thus , thresholds for finite networks can be estimated using the modified susceptibility  @xcite @xmath34 that does exhibit a divergence at the transition point for sis  @xcite and contact process  @xcite models on networks . the choice of the alternative definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) , instead of the standard susceptibility @xmath35  @xcite is due to the peculiarities of dynamical processes on the top of complex networks .",
    "it is expected that the qs state does not depend on the initial condition .",

    "the network was generated with the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm )  @xcite , where vertex degree is selected from a power - law distribution with a lower bound @xmath37 .",
    "the results are independent of the initial condition .",

    ", we implemented the lifespan method exactly as in ref .",
    "@xcite : the simulation starts with a single infected vertex located at the most connected vertex of the network and stops when either the system visits the absorbing state or 50% of all vertices ( the epidemic coverage ) were infected at least once along the simulation .",
    "the duration of the epidemic outbreak is computed and only runs that visited the absorbing state are used to compute the average lifespan since those that reached 50% of coverage are assumed as having an infinite lifespan .",
    "the number of runs varies from @xmath40 , for largest @xmath41 and @xmath13 , to @xmath42 , for the smallest @xmath13 .",
    "we applied both methods to the sis model on ucm networks with @xmath43 , minimum degree  @xmath37 , and upper cutoff @xmath44 , in which @xmath45 is the analytically determined mean value of the most connected vertex @xmath46 of a random degree sequence with distribution @xmath47 without upper bounds , to compare with the results of ref .",
    "the constraint @xmath44 avoids fluctuations in the most connected vertex and , consequently , in the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and is useful for comparisons with the qmf theory  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the constraint @xmath44 is only used in this comparison .    ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath44 for network sizes @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , increasing from the right .",

    "the peak positions against network size are compared in fig  [ fig : sustau_sis](c ) . as can be clearly seen , the right susceptibility peaks are very close to the lifespan ones showing that the susceptibility method is able to capture the same transitions as the lifespan method does but going beyond as discussed in the rest of the paper .",
    "it is worth noticing that if larger values of @xmath13 are simulated , other peaks will emerge in susceptibility curves even using the cutoff @xmath50 .",
    "these multiple peaks were not reported in previous works dealing with the same network model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a lifespan is also obtained in the qs method as  @xcite @xmath51 we checked that the lifespans obtained in the qs method and those of ref .",
    "@xcite diverge around the same threshold ; the basic difference is that the former is `` infinite '' above the threshold whereas the latter remains finite .    in a partial summary",
    ", we verified that the lifespan method predicts an epidemic threshold when an activity survives for long times , but there is no guaranty that it is necessarily an endemic phase ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] for a concrete counter - example ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the qs analysis is able to simultaneously determine transitions involving endemic as well as localized states and the one involving a diverging lifespan is resolved using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tauqs ] ) .",
    "so , we conclude that lifespan method must not be used alone in systems with multiple transitions since it captures the first transition with a long - term activity .",
    "two - peaks on susceptibility against infection rate for sis were firstly reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focused on the analysis of the peak at low @xmath13 and showed that it is well described by the qmf theory ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) but did not realize that the peak at higher @xmath13 is the one associated to a diverging lifespan ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sustau_sis ] ) .",
    "however , depending on the network realization , the susceptibility curves can exhibit much more complex behaviors with multiple peaks for values of @xmath13 larger than those reported in refs .",

    "multiple peaks are observed only if the degree distribution exhibits a few large gaps , in particular in the tails .",
    "these few vertices . ] with degree @xmath53 are hereafter called outliers .",
    "notice that the multiple peaks are not detected by the lifespan simulation method  @xcite .",
    "the role played by outliers is evidenced by their immunizations as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiam1 ] . for instance , the immunization of the three most connected vertices is sufficient to destroy two peaks and to enhance others .",
    "the stationary density varies abruptly close to the thresholds determined via susceptibility peaks , figs .",
    "[ fig : chiam1](b ) and ( c ) , which is an evidence of the singular behavior of the order parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the presence of gaps is a characteristics of large degree sequences with a power law distribution .",
    "the statistical representativity of specific properties of a finite set of networks , generated under the same conditions , in relation to the entire ensemble is a complex issue  @xcite , but the existence of gaps can be understood with a simple non - rigorous reasoning . using extreme value theory",
    "one can show that the most connected vertex has an average @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "however , this mean value is not representative of the highest degree since the dispersion @xmath56 diverges as in  ref .  @xcite . ] @xmath57 for @xmath0 .",
    "outliers should behave in this same way and therefore we expect larger dispersion in outlier connectivity as network size increases .    it is interesting to observe that while the peaks at small @xmath13 can or not appear depending on the presence of outliers and gaps , the rightmost one essentially does not change its position from a network realization to another , such that it should depend on network properties representative of the entire ensemble of networks with a specified set of parameters . indeed , later we will see that the behavior of the rightmost peak is qualitatively described by the hmf threshold which depends only on @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "a deeper physical explanation for the multiple peaks can be extracted using another order parameter in the qs state , the participation ratio ( pr ) , defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the probability that the vertex @xmath6 is infected in the stationary state .",

    "[ fig : phi ] .",
    "the pr is an estimate of the fraction of vertices that effectively contribute to the present epidemic activity .",
    "thus , the multiple transitions are related to the rapid delocalization processes of the epidemics as @xmath13 increases , hallmarked by the singular behavior of @xmath67 around distinct values of @xmath13 .",

    "the latter is a measure of stochastic fluctuations of the order parameter ( density of infected vertices ) whereas the former is measure of stationary spatial fluctuations that make sense only for heterogeneous substrates .",

    "our final overview is that apparently competing mean - field theories  @xcite can be considered , in fact , complementary , describing distinct transitions that may concomitantly emerge depending on the network structure . in particular , the transitions involving localized phases , as possibly the one predicted by the bcps theory  @xcite , are not negligible since they become long - term and an epidemic outbreak may eventually visit a finite fraction of the network .",
