    "measurements of the expansion rate history @xmath11 of the universe , when interpreted within the standard model of cosmology , convincingly indicate that the universe has recently entered a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "most of this unexpected evidence is provided via geometric probes of cosmology , that is by constraining the redshift scaling of the luminosity distances @xmath15 of cosmic standard candles ( such as supernovae ia ) , or of the angular diameter distance @xmath16 of cosmic standard rulers ( such as the sound horizon scale at the last scattering epoch ) .    despite much observational evidence ,",
    "little is known about the physical mechanism that drives cosmic acceleration . as a matter of fact ,",
    "virtually all the attempts to make sense of this perplexing phenomenon without invoking a new constant of nature ( the so called cosmological constant ) call for exotic physics beyond current theories .",
    "for example , it is speculated that cosmic acceleration might be induced by a non clustering , non evolving , non interacting and extremely light vacuum energy @xmath3 @xcite , or by a cosmic field with negative pressure , and thus repulsive gravitational effect , that changes with time and varies across space ( the so called dark energy fluid ) @xcite , if not by a break - down of einstein s theory of gravity on cosmological scales ( the so called dark gravity scenario ) @xcite .",
    "this last , extreme eventuality is made somewhat less far - fetched by the fact that a large variety of nonstandard gravitational models , inspired by fundamental physics arguments , can be finely tuned to reproduce the expansion rate history of the successful standard model of cosmology , the @xmath3cdm paradigm .",
    "although different models make undistinguishable predictions about the amplitude and scaling of background observables such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 the analysis of the clustering properties of matter on large linear cosmic scales is in principle sufficient to distinguish and falsify alternative gravitational scenarios .",
    "indeed , a generic prediction of modified gravity theories is that the newton constant @xmath19 becomes a time ( and possibly scale ) dependent function @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , dynamical observables of cosmology which are sensitive to the amplitude of @xmath19 , such as , for example , the clustering properties of cosmic structures , provide a probe for resolving geometrical degeneracies among models and for properly identifying the specific signature of nonstandard gravitational signals .",
    "considerable phenomenological effort is thus devoted to engineering and applying methods for extracting information from dynamical observables of the inhomogeneous sector of the universe @xcite .",
    "indeed , thanks to large and deep future galaxy redshift surveys , such as for example euclid @xcite , the clustering properties of matter will be soon characterized with a ` background level ' precision , thus providing us with stringent constraints on the viability of alternative gravitational scenarios .    extending the perimeter of precision cosmology beyond zeroth order observables into the domain of first order perturbative quantities critically depends on observational improvements but also on the refinement of theoretical tools . among the quantities that are instrumental in constraining modified gravity models , the linear growth index @xmath12 ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the scale factor of the universe",
    ", @xmath23 is the reduced density of matter and @xmath24 the dimensionless density contrast of matter , has attracted much attention . despite being in principle a function ,",
    "this quantity is often , and effectively , parameterized as being constant @xcite . among the various appealing properties of such an approximation , two in particular",
    "deserve to be mentioned .",
    "first , the salient features of the growth rate history of linear structures can be compressed into a single scalar quantity which can be easily constrained using standard parameter estimation techniques . as it is the case with parameters such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc . ,",
    "which incorporate all the information contained in the expansion rate function @xmath11 , so it is extremely economic to label and identify different growth histories @xmath27 with the single book - keeping index @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , since the growth index parameter takes distinctive values for distinct gravity theories , any deviation of its estimated amplitude from the reference value @xmath28 ( which represents the exact asymptotic early value of the function @xmath29 in a @xmath3cdm cosmology @xcite ) is generically interpreted as a potential signature of new gravitational physics .",
    "however useful in quantifying deviations from standard gravity predictions , this index must also be precise to be of any practical use . as a rule of thumb , the systematic error introduced by approximating @xmath29 with @xmath30 , which depends on @xmath31 ,",
    "must be much smaller than the precision with which future experiments are expected to constrain the growth index over a wide redshift range(@xmath32 @xcite ) .",
    "notwithstanding , already within a standard @xmath3cdm framework with @xmath33 , the imprecision of the asymptotic approximation is of order @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "more subtly , the expansion kinematic is expected to leave time dependent imprints in the growth index .",
    "the need to model the redshift evolution of the growth index , especially in view of the large redshift baseline that will be surveyed by future data , led to the development of more elaborated parameterizations @xcite . whether their justification is purely phenomenological or theoretical , these formulas aim at locking the expected time variation of @xmath29 into a small set of scalar quantities , the so called growth index parameters @xmath1 . for example",
    ", some authors ( e.g. @xcite ) suggest to use the taylor expansion @xmath36_{z=0}\\ , z$ ] for data fitting purposes . indeed , this approach has the merit of great accuracy at present epoch , but it becomes too inaccurate at the intermediate redshifts ( @xmath37 ) already probed by current data .    on top of precision issues , there are also interpretational concerns . ideally , we would like the growth index parameter space to be also in one - to - one correspondence with predictions of specific gravitational theories .",
    "in other terms we would like to use likelihood contours in this plane to select / reject specific gravitational scenarios .",
    "this is indeed a tricky issue .",
    "for example , it is rather involved to link the amplitude of the growth index parameters to predictions of theoretical models if the growth index fitting formula has a phenomenological nature .",
    "more importantly , it is not evident how to extract growth information ( @xmath38 ) from a function , @xmath12 which , as equation ( [ defuno ] ) shows , is degenerate with background information ( specifically @xmath39 ) .",
    "in other terms , the growth index parameters are model dependent quantity that can be estimated only after a specific model for the evolution of the background quantity @xmath39 is supplied .",
    "therefore it is not straightforward to use the likelihood function in the @xmath12-plane to reject dark energy scenarios for which the background quantities do not scale as in the fiducial . because of this , up to now , growth index measurements in a given fiducial",
    "were used to rule out only the null - hypothesis that the fiducial correctly describes large scale structure formation processes .",
    "growth index estimates were not used to gauge the viability of a larger class of alternative gravitational scenarios .",
    "a reverse argument also holds and highlights the importance of working out a growth index parameterization which is able to capture the finest details of the exact numerical solution , establishing at the same time , the functional dependence on background observables .",
    "indeed , once a given gravitational paradigm is assumed as a prior , the degeneracy of growth index measurements with background information , can be exploited to constraining the background parameter of the resulting cosmological model , directly using growth data .",
    "therefore , by expressing the growth index as a function of specific dark energy or dark gravity parameters one can test for the overall coherence of cosmological information extracted from the joint analyses of smooth and inhomogeneous observables .    in this paper",
    "we address some of these issues by means of a new parameterization of the growth index .",
    "the main virtues of the approach is that the proposed formula is _ a ) _ flexible , i.e.  it describes predictions of a wide class of cosmic acceleration models , _ b ) _ accurate , i.e.  it performs better than alternative models in reproducing exact numerical results , _ c ) _ it is observer friendly , i.e.  accuracy is achieved with a minimum number of parameters and _ d ) _ it is ` theorist friendly ' , i.e.  the amplitude of the fitting parameters can be directly and mechanically related , in an analytic way , to predictions of theoretical models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the parameterization for the growth index in section  [ sec : parametrizing ] , and we discuss its accuracy in describing various dark energy models such as smooth and clustering quintessence in  [ sec : standard ] . in  [ sec : modified ] we apply the formalism to modified gravity scenarios . in particular , we discuss the dgp @xcite and the parameterized post friedmanian @xcite scenarios . in  [",
    "sec : constraining ] we will impose the studied models to current ( simulated future ) data .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout all the paper ,",
    "if not specified differently , the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker cosmology with @xmath4 parameters @xmath40 @xcite is referred to as the _ reference _ @xmath3cdm model .",
    "in this section we introduce our notation and we give the theoretical background for analyzing the clustering of matter on large linear scales . for a large class of dark energy models and gravitational laws , at least on scales where the quasi - static approximation applies , the dynamics of linear matter perturbations @xmath41 can be effectively described by the following second order differential equation @xmath42 where overdot ( @xmath43 ) denotes derivation with respect to cosmic time @xmath44 and the dimensionless response @xmath45 and damping @xmath46 coefficients are general functions of cosmic time and possibly the spatial fourier frequency . as for the simplest case ,",
    "general relativity even augmented by a minimally coupled scalar field , marks the point @xmath47 while for modified gravity models we expect , in general , @xmath48 .",
    "the specific form of @xmath49 predicted in higher dimension brane models @xcite or in scalar tensor theories of gravity @xcite are given in  [ sec : dgp ] and  [ sec : skofe ] respectively .",

    "although , in some special cases , an exact analytic solution can be explicitly given ( for example , in terms of a hypergeometric function if @xmath56 and the de _ eos _ is constant @xcite ) , the approximate parametric solution @xmath57 has been widely advocated @xcite .",
    "indeed , the growth rate of matter density perturbations is highly sensitive to the kinematics of the smooth expansion of the universe , as well as to the gravitational instability properties of the background fluids .",
    "the approximate anstaz @xmath57 interestingly and neatly splits the background ( basis ) and the inhomogeneous contribution ( exponent ) to the linear growth rate of structures .",
    "gravitational models beyond standard general relativity , which predict identical background expansion histories , i.e.  identical observables @xmath58 and @xmath59 , may thus be singularized and differentiated by constraining the amplitude of @xmath12 . however solutions with a constant growth index of ( sub - horizon ) matter density perturbations can not be realized in quintessence models of dark energy over the whole period from the beginning of matter domination up into distant future .",
    "moreover , it is likely that different gravitational models tuned to reproduce the same expansion history @xmath60 display unidentical evolution for @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that the amplitudes of @xmath12 inferred in two different cosmological models , characterized by distinctive evolution laws of the matter density parameter , can not be directly compared .    in order to increase the accuracy of predictions , we look for a more elaborate parametric form of the growth index : we express @xmath12 as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "plugging ( [ eq : f_approximation ] ) into ( [ eq : f_h_general ] ) we obtain @xmath63 where we set @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that all non - constant coefficients ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 ) are well - defined functions of @xmath67 , and are completely specified once a theory of gravity is considered .",
    "since the numerical solution of equation ( [ eq : f_h_x ] ) for a @xmath3cdm model indicates that @xmath12 is an almost linear function of @xmath67 , and guessing that viable alternative theories of gravity should predict minimal , but detectable , deviations from standard model results , we suggest to describe the time evolution of the growth index as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 are constant parameters . expressing @xmath12 via a series expansion",
    "has already been proposed earlier by @xcite and improved later by @xcite . in those works @xmath70 ,",
    "whereas here we set @xmath64 .",
    "demonstrating the gain in accuracy achieved by this change of variable is one of the goals of this paper .",
    "a different one , but equally important , is to show that by this choice we can work out a closed analytic formula that predicts the amplitude of the coefficients @xmath71 ( up to an arbitrary order @xmath72 ) once any given dark energy and gravitational model is specified .",

    "in this section we frame our analysis in a friedmann lematre roberston & walker ( flrw ) model of the universe , a metric model characterized by two degrees of freedom : the spatial curvature of the universe @xmath81 and the scale factor @xmath85 .",
    "we therefore assume that gravity is ruled by the standard einstein field equations , and we further assume that the hyper - surfaces of constant time are flat ( @xmath86 ) as observations consistently suggest @xcite , and that , at least during the late stage of its evolution , i.e.  the period we are concerned with , the universe is only filled with cosmic matter and dark energy .",

    "the fluid is smooth . as an example of this last case",

    "we have explored a promising approach towards this goal .",
    "we have demonstrated both the precision and the flexibility of a specific parameterization of the growth index , that is the logarithmic expansion .",
    "if the fiducial gravitational model is not too different from standard gr , i.e.  possible deviations in both the background and perturbed sector can be interpreted as first order correction to the friedmann model , then the proposed parameterization scheme allows to match numerical results on the redshift dependence of the growth index with a relative error which is lower than the nominal precision with which the next generation of redshift surveys are expected to fix the scaling of this function .",
    "the performances are demonstrated by comparing , for various fiducial gravitational models , the accuracy of our proposal against that of different parameterizations available in the literature .    besides accuracy , the formalism features two other critical merits , one practical and one conceptual .",
    "first we supply a simple way for routinely calculating the amplitude of the growth indices in any gravitational model in which the master equation for the growth of density perturbations reduces to the form of eq .",

    "moreover , since the parameterization of the growth rate has not a phenomenological nature , but it is constructed as a series expansion of the exact solutions of the differential equation which rules the growth of structures ( cf .",
    "[ eq : f_h_general ] ) , one can easily interpret empirical results about the amplitude of the growth indices in terms of fundamental gravitational models .",
    "since the growth index is a model dependent quantity , it has been traditionally used only to reject , statistically , the specific model adopted to analyze growth data .",
    "we have shown , instead , that the growth index parameter space @xmath197 provides a diagnostic tool to discriminate a large class of models , even those presenting background evolution histories different from the fiducial model adopted in data analysis .",
    "in other terms , a detection of a present day growth index amplitude @xmath294 would not only indicate a deviation from @xmath3cdm predictions but could be used to disentangle among different alternative explanations of the cosmic acceleration in a straightforward way .",
    "the key to this feature is the mapping of eq .",
    "[ eq : f_approximation2 ] which allows to factor out the effect of expansion from the analysis of growth rate histories .",
    "as the standard @xmath295 plane identifies different expansion histories @xmath11 , the @xmath197 plane can thus be used to locate different growth rate histories @xmath13 .",
    "we have illustrated the performance of the growth index plane in relation to modify gravity model selection / exclusion by using current data as well as forecasts from future experiments .",
    "we have shown that the likelihood contours in the growth index plane @xmath220 can be used to tell apart a clustering quintessence component @xcite from a smooth dark energy fluid , to fix the parameters of viable parameterized post friedman gravitational models @xcite or to exclude specific gravitational models such as , for example , dgp @xcite .",
    "the performances of the analysis tool presented in this paper are expected to be enhanced , should the formalism be coupled to models parameterizing the large class of possible gravitational alternatives to standard gr available in the literature . in particular various approaches",
    "have been proposed to synthetically describe all the possible gravitational laws generated by adding a single scalar degree of freedom to einstein s equations  @xcite .",
