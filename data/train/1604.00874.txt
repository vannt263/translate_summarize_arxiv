    "in the sixties hnon and heiles studied the third integral of motion in the context of a star orbiting a galaxy center@xcite .",
    "until then it was known two of such constants of motion , angular momentum and energy .",
    "hnon - heiles introduced a combination of quadratic and cubic terms in the potential , later it was found out that such a stellar dynamics could be chaotic or describe a regular orbit .",
    "this close relation of hnon - heiles potential to chaotic systems was also explored in quantum mechanics  @xcite and we intend to explore such features in phase - space .",
    "it is interesting to describe representations of quantum equations directly in phase - space ; and some attempts have been made along these lines . as an example , torres - vega and frederick @xcite , motivated by the husimi function , introduced a basis in the hilbert space , @xmath0 , in phase space , @xmath1 , such that the position and momentum operators are given , respectively , by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for bosons is then derived by taking the wave function @xmath4 in @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath5 , as an amplitude of probability in @xmath1 , using the wigner function .",
    "some of these difficulties have been solved by using the notion of quasi - amplitude of probability , which is directly associated with the wigner function ( the quasi - probability ) and an analysis of the symmetry group in phase space @xcite .",
    "representations of the galilei group in a manifold with phase - space content have been studied since long ago  @xcite . such representation ,",
    "called symplectic unitary representation , has been used by many groups and one interesting analysis is developed by using the algebraic structure of the wigner formalism  @xcite . in this approach , each operator , @xmath6 , defined in the hilbert space , @xmath7 , is mapped in a function , @xmath8 , in @xmath1 .",
    "the mapping @xmath9 , when applied to a product of operators is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is called the star ( or moyal ) product .",
    "the algebra of operators defined in @xmath7 turns out to be an associative ( but not commutative ) algebra in @xmath12 given by the star product .",
    "this introduces a non - commutative algebraic structure in phase space , a result that has been explored in different ways since the paper by wigner  @xcite . a natural symplectic representation of lie groups",
    "is introduced in @xmath13 by considering star - operators defined as @xmath14 2kha2,seb2 . for the lorentz symmetry , the klein - gordon and dirac equation",
    "have been derived in @xmath1 .",
    "these symplectic representations provide a way to consider a perturbative approach for wigner function on the bases of symmetry groups .",
    "one example is the @xmath15 field theory in phase - space , leading to a relativisitic kinectic equation with a local boltzmann - like collision term .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , although associated with the wigner formalism , the symplectic representations have a hamiltonian , not a liouvillian , operator as the generator of time translations .",
    "this approach then provides satisfactory physical interpretation for numerous aspects of a quantum theory formulated from a unitary phase - space representation , in particular due to its clear association with the wigner function .    in the present work ,",
    "the problem of constructing a formalism in phase space based on unitary symmetry is addressed by using star - operators . using the galilei group , physical aspects of the formalism",
    "are reviewed as the notion of quasi - amplitudes of probability in @xmath16 .",
    "then the hydrogen atom is described in pase space and the hnon - heiles potential is added to such a system in order to explore chaotic features .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we present the schrdinger in the phase space . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we show the relation between the quasi - amplitude of probability and wigner function . in sections [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] , we calculate the wigner functions , as applications , to the hydrogen atom and we introduce a hnon - heiles potential as an extra interaction in subatomic systems such as the hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field in phase space . in section",
    "[ nc ] we introduce a parameter that can measure how the system is appart from the classical behavior .",
    "finally , some closing comments are given in section [ 6 ] .",
    "here we review some aspects of the schrdinger equation in phase space , in order to extend the formalism to many - body systems . we consider initially a one - particle system described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass and the momentum , respectively , of the particle .",
    "the wigner formalism for such a system is constructed from the liouville - von neumann equation@xmath20,\\]]where @xmath21  is the density matrix .",
    "the wigner function , @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23and satisfies the equation of motion@xmath24where , @xmath25 is the moyal bracket , such that the star - product @xmath26 is given by@xmath27with @xmath28 the functions @xmath29 are defined in a manifold @xmath1 , using the basis ( @xmath30 ) with the physical content of the phase space . in this formalism an operator ,",
    "say @xmath31 defined in the hilbert space @xmath7 , is represented by the function @xmath32such that the product of two operators , @xmath33 , reads@xmath34the average of @xmath6 in a state @xmath35 is given by@xmath36    due to the intricate structure of eq .",
    "( [ wigago52 ] ) , one can look for an alternative formulation for the wigner function , in such a way that the usual perturbative approach is extended to phase phase , in particular to describe interacting many - body systems .",
    "guided by this motivation , we proceed by first introducing a hilbert space , @xmath37 , associated with the phase space @xmath1 .",
    "consider the set of functions , @xmath38 in @xmath16 , such that @xmath39 is a bilinear real form .",
    "unitary mappings , @xmath40 , in @xmath37 are naturally introduced by using the star - product , i.e.  @xmath41 , where @xmath42   \\\\ & = a(q+\\frac{i\\hbar } { 2}\\partial _ { p},p-\\frac{i\\hbar } { 2}\\partial _ { p}).\\end{aligned}\\]]let us consider some examples . for the basic functions in @xmath1 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( 3-dimensional euclidian vectors ) ,",

    ". then we introduce a galilei boost by defining the boost generator @xmath48 , @xmath49 , such that @xmath50these results , with the commutation relations , show that @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be physically interpreted as the position and momentum operators , respectively .",

    "therefore , the manifold defined by the set of eingenvalues @xmath64 has the content of a phase space .",
    "however , the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 are not observables , since they commute with each other .    considering a homogeneous systems satisfying the galilei symmetry , the commutations relation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is @xmath67=i\\widehat{p}_{j}$ ] , i.e.@xmath68=ip_{j}+\\frac{\\hbar% } { 2}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial q_{j}}.\\]]a solution , providing a general form to @xmath69 , is @xmath70this is the hamiltonian of a one - body system in an external field .",
    "such an interpretations has to be consistent with the notion of gauge invariance .",
    "let us investigate this point by analysing the lagrangian associated with the equation of motion for @xmath71    consider the time evolution of a state @xmath72 , that is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "this result leads to a schrdinger - like equation in phase - space , i.e.@xmath75",
    "now let us consider the physical meaning of the state @xmath76 .",
    "this is carried out by associating @xmath76 with the wigner function . from eq .",
    "( [ ago25.1 ] ) , one can prove that @xmath77 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ wigago52 ] ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , using the associative property of the moyal product and the relation @xmath78we have @xmath79where @xmath80  is an observable .",
    "thus the wigner function is calculated by using @xmath81it is to be noted also that the eigenvalue equation , @xmath82results in @xmath83 therefore , @xmath38 and @xmath84 satisfy the same differential equation .",
    "these results show that eq .",
    "( [ ago25.1 ] ) is a fundamental starting point for the description of quantum physics in phase space , fully compatible with the wigner formalism .",
    "an attractive aspect of this method is that the powerfull methods developed in quantum theory based on the notion of linear spaces , such as the perturbative techniques , can be explored in the phase space in a straightforward way .",
    "the fundamental tool is the phase - space wave function @xmath85 , that is a quasi - amplitude of probability .",
    "in this section we solve the schrdinger equation in phase space for the coulomb potential .",
    "our analysis considers a one dimensional system , where the potential is @xmath86 and leading to @xmath87we follow in parallel to previous developments @xcite .",
    "however , we have to note that the difference in our operators is a necessary conditions to provide the physical interpretation for the wave function @xmath88 , a quasi - amplitude of probability , leading to the wigner function .",
    "this is the main ( and new ) result to be derived here .",

    ". then eq .",
    "( [ hys1 ] ) takes the form , @xmath102\\phi ( \\eta , p)=e\\phi ( \\eta , p ) .",
    "\\label{hys2}\\]]using the ansatz @xcite @xmath103 we get @xmath104where @xmath105 . defining @xmath106 , we have    @xmath107    this differential equation is identified with the equation for confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "its solution in the variable @xmath108 is given by @xcite @xmath109where @xmath110 is the confluent hypergeometric function and @xmath111 is an arbitrary function of variable @xmath44 .",
    "we using @xmath112 , the energy has the form @xmath113which can be put into the form @xmath114 , as expected .",
    "finally we write eq.([+eq ] ) as ,    @xmath115    and analogously , for @xmath92 the solution is @xmath116for the particular case of @xmath117 , and using the relation @xmath118the solutions are    @xmath119    this solution is similar to the results of ref .",
    "but in our construction , we get the physical interpretation in terms of the wigner function . for example , taking @xmath120 , the wigner function for the fundamental state is @xmath121computing the star product to second order we get    @xmath122    using this wigner function , we find the maximum of the probability density associated with the position variable .",
    "it is interesting to take the expression of the probability density , as    @xmath123    next by differentiating with respect to @xmath43 , we get @xmath124 which is the bohr radius .",
    "in this section we ll allow a new interaction in the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom in the presence of magnetic field which is realized by hnon - heiles potential .",
    "in general subatomic systems such as the hydrogen atom can be described by a harmonic oscillator through a proper change of variables , however this procedure is limited .",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian of the form  @xcite    @xmath125    where @xmath126and @xmath127this hamiltonian describes the system we are interested in where @xmath128 is the hnon - heiles potential and @xmath129 stands for the potential of the hydrogen atom in an uniform magnetic field potential .",
    "the term @xmath130 is scaled energy and measures the energy of the electron in units of magnetic field which governs the classical dynamics .",
    "the quantity @xmath131 is the magnetic field in atomic units of @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the rydeberg energy .    in order to represent this system in phase space",
    "we perform in ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) a change of variables @xmath134 wich are given by the operators defined in ( [ eq 13 ] ) and ( [ eq 14 ] ) .",
    "thus we define the annihilation and creation operators in each direction with @xmath135 which read    @xmath136    and @xmath137 hence the hamiltonian is given by    @xmath138\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\widehat{h}^{0}(q , p ) +   \\widehat{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath139    and    @xmath140    it is interesting to note that such a hamiltonian describes a system of coupled oscillators .    we ll use the perturbation theory to treat this system in order to calculate quasi - probability amplitudes and respective wigner functions .",
    "thus we ll restrict our attention to the case where @xmath141 is a perturbation .",
    "let us begin with the time - independent schrdinger equation in phase space for harmonic oscillator which reads    @xmath142    where @xmath143and @xmath144",
    "we recall that the hamiltonian is @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath147 is the perturbation .",
    "therefore the wave function and energy have a perturbative series as    @xmath148    and @xmath149 if we insert equations ( [ eq:1.3a ] ) and ( [ eq:1.3b ] ) into equation ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) , then it yields @xmath150 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left(e^{0}+   e_{n}^{1}+   e_{n}^{2}+\\cdots\\right ) \\big [ \\psi_{n}^{0}+   \\psi_{n}^{1}\\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\psi_{n}^{2}+\\cdots \\big ] \\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the zero - order term is    @xmath151    the first order correction is @xmath152 and the second order correction is given by    @xmath153    now we intend to develop separated these last two corrections in the following subsections .",
    "the first order corrections are obtained by writing eq.([eq:1.4a ] ) as @xmath154 then @xmath155 is expressed in terms of of a complete set of states as @xmath156 if we substitute ( [ eq:1.5a ] ) into ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) , then we get    @xmath157    multiplying by @xmath158 and integrating in @xmath159 , yields    @xmath160    we recall that the wave functions of unperturbed systems are ortogonal i.e    @xmath161    then equation ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) becomes    @xmath162    it is worth noting that two cases arise .",
    "@xmath163 yields @xmath164 such an equation provides the first order correction to the energy of the unperturbed system . on the other hand the second condition @xmath165 gives us @xmath166 the above expression is well defined since @xmath167",
    ". therefore the first order approximation of the wave function for the hnon - heiles and hydrogen atom potential ( [ eq:1.2b ] ) is @xmath168 where @xmath169 .",
    "it reads    @xmath170    where the coefficients are listed in appendix [ appendix ] .",

    "the present work deals with the problem of constructing a formalism in phase space based on the unitary symmetry .",
