    "neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in our universe and therefore play an important role in the formation of large - scale structure . in the past 10 years neutrino oscillation experiments have verified that neutrinos have small , but non - zero masses and that they therefore contribute to the dark matter density in the universe .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have established the existence of two distinct neutrino mass splittings , @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 has been found by observing solar and reactor neutrinos , and @xmath4 by observing atmospheric neutrinos and by accelerator experiments ( see e.g.  @xcite for recent data analyses ) .",
    "this gives a lower bound on the sum of the neutrino masses which is @xmath5 for the normal hierarchy and @xmath6 for the inverted hierarchy .    using a combination of cosmological observables such as the cosmic microwave background , large scale structure , and type ia supernovae a bound on the sum of neutrino masses of @xmath7 ev ( 95% c.l . )",
    "has been derived @xcite .",
    "the actual value of the bound depends both on the specific combination of data sets used and on the cosmological model . at the moment",
    "a fairly robust upper limit can be taken to be roughly @xmath8 ev .",
    "this bound mainly uses structure formation data in the linear regime ( @xmath9 ) , but even on such large scales some non - linear contamination is present and must be modelled .",
    "this has been done in detail for variations of the standard @xmath10cdm model , but so far not in a truly consistent way for models which include massive neutrinos .    for the study of neutrino mass bounds with present data",
    "the current precision of theoretical power spectrum calculations in the regime @xmath11 is sufficient in the sense that the final result does not depend very significantly on the method used ( however , see e.g.  @xcite for an exception ) .",
    "however , future high precision lensing and galaxy redshift surveys , such as the lsst @xcite , will constrain the matter power spectrum to percent level precision on scales of @xmath11 .    at this level of accuracy",
    "the inclusion of neutrinos in the calculation of the matter power spectrum will be crucial , even for neutrino masses close to the current lower bound .",
    "while the effect of neutrinos in the linear theory power spectrum is understood in detail much work remains to be done in the semi - linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "furthermore , semi - analytic models of non - linear structure formation such as the halo model must always be checked against _ n_-body simulations .",
    "neutrinos have thermal velocities which exceed typical gravitational flow velocities by an order of magnitude or more , even at low redshift .",
    "therefore , when setting up initial conditions for _ n_-body simulations the neutrino thermal velocities need to be added to the gravitational flow velocities found from the neutrino transfer function .",
    "including neutrino thermal velocities in _",
    "n_-body simulations is not without problems because the thermal motion introduces a noise term which will affect the underlying gravitational evolution unless high resolution is used .",
    "the problem is similar to the well known problem that particles in an _",
    "n_-body simulation must be put in a configuration like a grid or a glass which respects small - scale homogeneity in order not to introduce a large poisson noise term . when thermal velocities are included momentum phase space must be sampled and the initial thermal velocities should preferably be chosen in a way where small - scale momentum conservation is enforced .    in the present paper",
    "we present the first _",
    "n_-body simulations in which neutrino thermal velocities have been included and convergent results achieved for @xmath12 . in the early 90s @xcite included neutrino thermal velocities albeit for a model with much higher neutrino masses , and no convergent results were proven .",
    "we also note another recent paper @xcite in which thermal motion has been included for warm dark matter , a set - up somewhat different from what is studied here .",
    "neutrino clustering in the small - scale limit has been studied using a completely different approach @xcite where the full boltzmann equation has been solved for neutrinos in a background given by pure cold dark matter ( cdm ) , i.e.  no feed - back is included and neutrinos are treated as tracer particles in the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "this method allows for arbitrarily high resolution , but is not truly self - consistent .    in section [ secic ]",
    "we describe the linear theory evolution and the set - up of initial conditions for our neutrino _ n_-body simulations . in section [ secnbody ]",
    "we describe how our _ n_-body simulations are performed , and in section [ secresults ] the results are described in detail .",
    "finally , section [ secdiscussion ] contains a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "evolving the primordial density perturbations set down by inflation to the present involves several steps . as long as perturbations remain small",
    "the evolution can be calculated precisely using the linearised einstein and boltzmann equations @xcite , using software such as camb @xcite or cmbfast @xcite .    in this regime",
    "the power spectrum can be factorised into a primordial component , @xmath13 , and a transfer function ( tf ) , @xmath14 , which contains all information about the evolution of structure so that @xmath15 .",
    "however , once structure enters the non - linear regime precision studies require the use of _ n_-body simulations . to set up the initial conditions ( ics ) for our simulations",
    "we have calculated the tfs using cmbfast ( using camb yields similar results ) .",
    "we have assumed a flat cosmological model with density parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the baryon , matter and cosmological constant components , respectively , and a hubble parameter of @xmath19 .",
    "we vary the cdm and neutrino density parameters ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) fulfilling the condition @xmath22 . we have assumed a primordial power spectrum of the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 , i.e.  a standard scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",

    "are used to generate the position and velocity ics for the _ n_-body particles . the zeldovich approximation ( za )",
    "@xcite , based on first - order lagrangian perturbation theory , is a standard way to calculate the ics . using second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt )",
    "@xcite it is possible to generate ics in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "we are particularly interested in these second - order corrections because the presence of neutrino thermal velocity noise requires simulations to be started at low redshift , close to the non - linear regime .",
    "we have used a modified version of the 2lpt initial conditions code of @xcite to generate the ics for our simulations .",
    "the modifications are described in detail below .    in the _",
    "n_-body simulations we include two particle species , cdm and neutrinos .",
    "it is not possible to generate particle ics for each species simultaneously with the za+2lpt formalism .",
    "instead we generate ics one particle species at a time by using their respective tfs ( for cdm we have used a weighted sum of the cdm and baryon tfs for consistency , even though this only matters at high redshift ) .",
    "thereafter , the _ n_-body particle masses for each species are scaled so that they make up their proper fraction of @xmath28 .",
    "the initial positions for the _ n_-body particles are found by adding a displacement field to a regular grid . a standard way to get",
    "the particle velocities is to differentiate the initial position displacements .",
    "this procedure involves using several numerically determined fitting factors , and therefore breaks down when two species with different tfs are present since then the growth factor is both species and mode dependent . instead , we get the velocities by generating two displacement fields centered around our starting redshift and then take the time difference .",
    "we have tested that these velocities do not depend on the distance in redshift between the two extra displacement fields in a suitable range around our starting redshift .",
    "2lpt involves a relation between the first- and second - order growth factors .",
    "but since the perturbed energy density even at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 designates the @xmath0-body starting redshift ) is vastly dominated by cdm , we can neglect the neutrino contribution to the driving term for the cdm growth factor since this would give a small correction to a second - order term .",
    "because the neutrinos are smoothly distributed , first - order theory is very accurate for them , and therefore the second - order corrections give negligible contributions to the neutrinos .",
    "we note that this is somewhat similar to the approach taken in refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of semi - analytic power spectrum modelling .    in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] the cdm and neutrino distributions are shown at @xmath29 .",
    "since we run simulations with different numbers of cdm and neutrino @xmath0-body particles , the amplitude and phase of the common large - scale modes of each species have been generated with the same random numbers .",
    "therefore , from fig .  [",
    "fig : rho ] one can identify the components as having the same large - scale structure . because of the higher value of the cdm tf at small scales , this component has additional clearly visible small - scale structure .",
    "as expected , the neutrino distributions are more homogeneous than their cdm counterpart .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 distributions are similar at @xmath29 , with the latter distribution being marginally more homogeneous , as can also be inferred from the tfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : tf02 ] .",
    "since the neutrino mass is small the thermal velocities can not be neglected even at low redshift if percent level precision is to be obtained .",
    "instead , the velocity of a given neutrino @xmath0-body particle contains a thermal component drawn from an equilibrium fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution .",
    "assuming isotropy for the thermal component the probability , @xmath33 , for a neutrino having a momentum smaller than @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath0 is a normalisation which ensures that the probability is bounded between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ fig : fd ] shows the cumulative fd distributions for different one - particle neutrino masses .",
    "the magnitudes of the neutrino thermal velocities were drawn randomly from the fd velocity distribution , and the directions of the thermal velocities were drawn at random as well .",
    "this reflects the fact that the neutrino velocity can be split into two uncorrelated contributions .",
    "an equilibrium , random contribution arising from the fd distribution and an out - of - equilibrium gravitational flow contribution found from the za+2lpt formalism .",
    "the neutrinos decoupled from the baryon - photon plasma before the annihilation of electrons and positrons , and as a result the neutrino temperature is related to the photon temperature by the approximate relation @xmath38 .",
    "assuming @xmath39 at late times the 3 neutrino generations contribute the following to the present neutrino density parameter @xcite @xmath40    the finite number of neutrino _",
    "n_-body particles gives rise to noise in the power spectrum .",
    "physically this leads to spuriously strong clustering of neutrinos on small scales , even at early times .",
    "as will be discussed below we have carefully checked that this noise term is negligible on the scales of interest in our simulations .    however , since the neutrino thermal velocity distribution redshifts as @xmath41 , and the neutrino and cdm out - of - equilibrium density contrasts and velocity fields increase with the expansion of the universe , it is paramount to start the _",
    "n_-body simulations as late , and therefore as close to the non - linear regime , as possible .",
    "this in turn constrains the scales on which clustering can be reliably calculated .",
    "we have tested the validity of starting the _",

    "this has been done by starting 4 pure @xmath10cdm simulations , at @xmath42 49 , 11.5 , 7 and 4 , and evolving them to the present .",
    "the difference in the matter power spectrum between these simulations is at the few percent level on small scales . since the neutrino simulations include a smaller amount of cdm this is an upper limit .",
    "the 2lpt corrections were crucial for achieving such a small discrepancy . since we are interested in quantifying the relative effect of including neutrinos , and _ not _ the exact absolute value of the matter power spectrum , we are justified in choosing @xmath29 as the lowest starting redshift for our _ n_-body simulations .",
    "if the absolute power spectrum is desired at the percent level a higher starting redshift should be chosen , but we stress that this will have a minimal effect on the relative change in the matter power spectrum coming from including the neutrino component .",

    "[ fig : damping ] shows the well - known scale dependent damping of power when neutrinos are included .",
    "as expected , the damping is much larger in the @xmath71 case as compared to @xmath72 because @xmath20 is smaller in the former case even though the neutrino thermal velocity is largest for the lower mass neutrino .    from fig .",

    "now , focusing on the @xmath105 case and @xmath90 , we would like to estimate the error made by not including the perturbed neutrino component in the @xmath0-body simulation . because the damping of the power spectrum is nearly independent of @xmath30 it is possible to estimate the matter power spectrum with neutrinos and thermal velocities without actually performing the simulation . more specifically , assuming that the damping effect is independent of @xmath30 , the matter power spectrum at @xmath82 for an @xmath0-body simulation started at @xmath90 with neutrinos and thermal velocities can be found from @xmath108 .",
    "this estimated power spectrum is used as the base in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nu0 ] .",
    "this figure shows the error made by neglecting the perturbed neutrino component . on scales relevant for @xmath0-body simulations ,",
    "i.e. @xmath109 , the error made is at the 1% level",
    ". for comparison the effect of neglecting the thermal velocities is also shown , and it can be seen that it is a better approximation to neglect the perturbed neutrino component than to include it but neglect the thermal velocity component .",
    "in the @xmath89 case we have all the relevant power spectra at starting redshifts of 4 and 49 .",
    "therefore we can test the validity of estimating the power spectrum with neutrinos and thermal velocities .",
    "we have found that the base in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : nu0 ] is overestimated so that the error made by neglecting the perturbed neutrino component is an upper bound .",
    "we have tried to decrease the error made by neglecting the perturbed neutrino component .",
    "this has been done by including the perturbed neutrino component without thermal velocities in the @xmath0-body simulation , but switching off the effect of the gravitational field on the neutrinos , so that the gravitational flow velocities of the neutrinos at @xmath30 are frozen in time .",
    "this should improve the estimate of the matter power spectrum in two ways : first , by including the perturbed neutrino component the power spectrum will increase .",
    "second , by switching off gravity , artificial small - scale structures will not form . with this method",
    "the error was decreased , especially on large scales in the @xmath89 case for @xmath29 , but the error did not approach percent level precision . on the contrary , in the @xmath105 case and for @xmath90 the error @xmath110 to the 10 - 15% level .",
    "the reason is that at such a high redshift the neutrino gravitational flow velocities and density perturbations are very small effectively freezing the neutrinos on a regular grid . because of neutrino @xmath0-body particle shot - noise this stationary regular grid deflects the cdm particles and therefore reduces the amount of structure forming",
    "we have performed a precise calculation of the effect of including neutrino dark matter on the matter power spectrum .",
    "the effect of thermal neutrino motion has been included directly , and we have shown that this effect changes the matter power spectrum significantly .    specifically , we find that the suppression of power due to the presence of massive neutrinos is increased by non - linear effects . whereas in linear theory the suppression of power on small scales",
    "is given roughly by @xmath111 , the full non - linear calculation gives @xmath112 at a scale of @xmath113 , i.e.  an increase of about 20% .    on smaller scales the non - linear contribution to the suppression decreases again .",
    "this effect has previously been noted in semi - analytic studies such as @xcite , and occurs on a scale which depends upon the amount of cdm and the neutrino free - streaming length .",
    "the increased suppression due to non - linear effects is highly relevant for future high precision large - scale structure and weak lensing surveys . even for neutrino masses approaching the lower bound , found from oscillation experiments , it is large enough to bias the estimate of other cosmological parameters .",
    "conversely , it provides a very distinct signature which could allow for the detection and measurement of even very low - mass neutrinos .    for @xmath109 , which include the modes for which _",
    "n_-body simulations are needed , it is a better approximation to the `` true '' power spectrum to neglect the perturbed neutrino component than to include it without thermal velocities . in both cases",
    "the approximation to the `` true '' power spectrum is better than if a standard @xmath10cdm model was assumed .",
    "but only in our lowest mass neutrino case , @xmath105 , is the error on the non - linear matter power spectrum made by neglecting the perturbed neutrino component in the @xmath0-body simulation at the desired 1% level for the relevant modes , even for an @xmath0-body simulation with a starting redshift as high as 49 .",
    "the error would be decreased further for smaller neutrino masses .",
    "an alternative method for implementing the physics of neutrinos in @xmath0-body simulations is to represent the neutrino component as a fluid and solve the corresponding fluid equations on a grid .",
    "this method would be particularly useful for neutrino masses close to the lower observational bound .",
