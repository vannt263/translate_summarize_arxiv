    "one of the most interesting topics in high energy physics is to clarify the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the phase where we live is called hadronic phase .",
    "a remarkable feature in this phase is that quarks and gluons are confined . at high temperature ,",
    "quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase is realized .",
    "quarks and gluons are not confined in the qgp phase .",
    "this phase has been confirmed by high energy accelerator experiments , for example , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiment .",
    "moreover , more powerful experiments have been conducted by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    on the other hand , the phase structure at low temperature and",
    "large chemical potential has not been understood very well . since",
    "presently , it is still not possible to test the low temperature and large chemical potential regime in the laboratory , and we can not use the lattice simulation method because of the `` sign problem '' , the features of this region of the qcd phase diagram are still uncertain . in order to investigate the nature at such conditions the nambu - jone - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite has been used .",
    "it has been considered that a color superconducting phase @xcite , which may occur in different forms such as the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase or the color flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase , may be realized under these conditions .",
    "this phase may appear inside compact stars , such as neutron stars .",
    "compact stars are very dense astrophysical objects which may have very strong magnetic fields @xcite",
    ". however , the mechanism that explains the generation of such strong magnetic fields is still not completely understood .",
    "in particular , the phase structure at large chemical potential and the possible existence of a spin polarized phase should be investigated .",
    "the possible existence of a quark ferromagnetic phase has been discussed with one - gluon - exchange interaction in ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , the possibility that spins of quarks may polarize at large chemical potential has been studied with axial vector - type interaction in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a vector - type interaction which respects chiral symmetry has been introduced in the njl model and it has been shown that spin polarization could occur if the chemical potential is within a narrow range of values . the relationship between the vector - type interaction and the 2sc has been discussed and it has been indicated that chiral condensed phase and 2sc phase may coexist if the contribution from the vector - type interactions considered in ref.@xcite .    although a term for spin polarization can be derived from the vector - type interaction , we pay attention to a tensor - type interaction , which , of course , respects chiral symmetry .",
    "the interaction has been introduced in ref.@xcite and a spin polarization term can be derived from it .",
    "note that the spin polarization term from the tensor - type interaction is not identical to that from the vector - type interaction , and the term from the tensor - type interaction can be interpreted as an anomalous magnetic moment induced dynamically according to ref.@xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "the relationship between the spin polarization and the color superconductivity has been investigated at zero temperature , and in our preceding paper @xcite the discussion has been extended to finite temperature . according to our preceding paper , the chiral condensed phase and the spin polarized phase do not coexist , and the order of the phase transition from the spin not - polarized phase to the spin polarized phase is second order .",
    "the effect from an external magnetic field on the spin polarization has been studied in ref.@xcite , and it has been shown that ferromagnetism may occur if we assume an anomalous magnetic moment for the quarks . in the present work , we investigate the possible existence of spin polarization and color superconductivity in the nambu - jona - lasinio model with a tensor - type interaction at finite density and temperature .    in the following section we introduce the njl model with the tensor - type interaction and calculate the thermodynamic potential by the functional integral method .",
