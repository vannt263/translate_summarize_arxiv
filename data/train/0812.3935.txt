    "random solids , such as chemical gels , rubber , glasses and amorphous silica , are characterized by their",
    "_ structural _ heterogeneity , which results from the randomness locked - in  at the time they are synthesized .",
    "the mean positions of the constituent particles exhibit no long - range order , and every particle inhabits a unique spatial environment .",
    "the _ elasticity _ of random solids also inherits heterogeneity from this locked - in randomness .",
    "for example , the lam coefficients and the residual stress vary from point to point throughout the elastic medium . the central goal of this paper is to develop a statistical characterization of random elastic media , via the mean values of the lam coefficients and the residual stress as well as the two - point spatial correlations amongst the fluctuations of these quantities , which we shall name as the disorder correlator . these mean values and correlations",
    "are to be thought of as averages taken over realizations of the sample fabrication for a given set of fabrication parameters .",
    "we expect these characteristic quantities to coincide with the volume - averages of their single - sample counterparts",
    ".    our focus will be on _ soft _ random solids .",
    "these are network media that include chemical gels  @xcite , which are formed by the permanent random chemical bonding of small molecules , as well as rubber  @xcite , which is formed via the introduction of permanent random chemical cross - links between nearby monomers in melts or solutions of flexible long - chain polymers .",
    "soft random solids are characterized by their _",
    "entropic elasticity_. these are media in which the shear modulus originates in the strong thermal fluctuations of the configurations of the constituent particles and is much smaller than the bulk modulus , which is energetic in nature and originates in the excluded - volume interactions between the particles .",
    "the concept of entropic elasticity forms the basis of the classical theory of rubber elasticity , developed long ago by kuhn , flory , wall , treloar and others ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as we discuss soft random solids we shall take chemical gels as our prototype media .",
    "when the density of the introduced links exceeds the percolation threshold , an infinite cluster of linked molecules forms , spanning the system , and the network acquires a thermodynamic rigidity with respect to shear deformations  .",
    "this event is often called the gelation transition  or the vulcanization transition  @xcite .",
    "the _ geometrical _ or _ architectural _ aspects of the gelation / vulcanization transition can be well captured by the theory of percolation  @xcite . however , to study the _ elasticity _ that emerges at the gelation / vulcanization transition , and especially its heterogeneity , one needs a theory that incorporates not only the geometrical aspects , but also the equilibrium thermal fluctuations of the particle positions and the strong , qualitative changes that they undergo at the gelation / vulcanization transition . in the setting of rubber elasticity , although the classical theory is successful in explaining the entropic nature of the shear rigidity of rubber , it is essentially based on a single - chain picture and , as such , is incapable of describing the consequences of the long scale random structure of rubbery media , e.g. , the random spatial variations in their local elastic parameters and the resulting nonaffinity of their local strain - response to macroscopic applied stresses .    the general problem of heterogeneous elasticity and nonaffine deformations has been studied in the setting of flexible polymer networks  @xcite , and also semi - flexible polymer networks  @xcite , glasses  @xcite , and granular materials  @xcite . particularly noteworthy",
    "is the recent investigation by didonna and lubensky of the general relationship between the spatial correlations of the nonaffine deformations and those of the underlying quenched random elastic parameters  @xcite .",
    "the mission of the present work is to develop a statistical characterization of the heterogeneous elasticity of soft random solids by starting from a semi - microscopic model and applying a body of techniques that we shall call vulcanization theory to it . in particular",
    ", we aim to obtain the mean values and disorder correlators of elastic parameters , such as the lam coefficients and the residual stress , in terms of the parameters of the semi - microscopic model , such as the density of cross - links , the excluded - volume interactions , etc .",
    "one of our key findings is that the disorder correlator of the residual stress is long ranged , as are all cross - disorder correlators between the residual stress and the lam coefficients .",
    "we also find that these disorder correlators are controlled by a universal scale parameter ",
    "independent of the microscopic details  that , moreover , controls the scale of the mean shear modulus .",
    "in addition , we characterize the nonaffininity of the deformations in terms of these parameters .",
    "the strategy we adopt for accomplishing our goals involves a handshaking  between two different analytical schemes .",
    "the first scheme follows a well - trodden path .",
    "we begin with a semi - microscopic model , the randomly linked particle model ( rlpm )  @xcite , involving particle coordinates and quenched random interactions between them that represent the randomness that is locked - in at the instant of cross - linking . in order to account for this quenched randomness , as well as the thermal fluctuations in particle positions which are the origin of the entropic elasticity",
    ", we adopt the framework of vulcanization theory  @xcite .",
    "this framework includes the use of the replica method to eliminate the quenched randomness , followed by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to construct a field - theoretic representation in terms of an order parameter field  in this case , the random solidification order parameter .",
    "we analyze this representation at the stationary - point level of approximation , and then focus on the gapless excitations around the stationary point ",
    "the goldstone fluctuations  observing that these excitations can be parameterized in terms of a set of replicated shear deformation fields  @xcite .",
    "the second prong of our approach is less conventional .",
    "it begins with our introduction of a phenomenological model free energy of an elastic continuum , characterized by a nonlocal kernel of quenched random attractions between mass - points . to obtain statistical information about this",
    "quenched random kernel , we use the replica method to eliminate the randomness , and obtain a pure model of replicas of the deformation field with couplings controlled by the disorder - moments of the kernel ; these disorder - moments are then treated as unknown quantities to be determined .",
    "this pure model has precisely the same structure as the goldstone theory mentioned in the previous paragraph has .",
    "thus , by comparing the two models we can learn the moments of the quenched random kernel from the ( already - computed ) coupling functions of the goldstone model . then we analyze a particular realization of the phenomenological model having a fixed value of the quenched randomness .",
    "we observe that the natural reference state ( i.e. , the state of vanishing displacement field ) of this model is not in fact an equilibrium state for any given realization of disorder , due to the random attractive interactions embodied by the kernel .",
    "we analyze how these attractions compete with the near - incompressibility of the medium to determine the displacement to the new , equilibrium configuration , which we shall term the relaxed state.(this process can be understood in the setting of a hypothetical , instant process of preparing a sample of rubber : the cross - links introduce attractions and random stresses , and the system then undergoes relaxation , including global contraction and local deformation . )   we then explore shear deformations around this relaxed state , pass to the local limit , and arrive at the standard form of continuum elasticity theory , expressed in terms of the strain around the relaxed state , but with coefficients that are explicit functions of the quenched random kernel .",
    "thus , using the information about the statistics of the quenched random kernel obtained via the comparison with the rlpm , we are able to infer statistical information about the elastic properties of the random elastic medium in the relaxed state , which is of experimental relevance .",
    "why is it legitimate to identify the goldstone theory arising from the microscopic model with the replica theory of the phenomenological model ?",
    "the reason is that , within the schemes that we have chosen to analyze them , both models describe shear deformations not of the equilibrium state of the system but , rather , of the system immediately after cross - linking has been done but before any cross - linking - induced relaxation has been allowed to occur .",
    "the equivalence between these two schemes is not based solely on the equality of free energies of the two models ; it is also based on the identity of the physical meaning of the ( replicated ) deformation fields in the two theories , and thus the way that these fields couple to externally applied forces .",
    "both schemes are descriptions of the elasticity of soft random solids displaying heterogeneous elastic properties , one from a semi - microscopic viewpoint , the other invoking phenomenological parameters .",
    "thus , the equivalence of the two schemes provides the values of the phenomenological parameters as functions of the semi - microscopic parameters .    before concluding this introduction ,",
    "let us emphasize that this work is a first attempt to _ derive _ the elastic heterogeneities of vulcanized matters . to date , the prevalent strategy in studies of disordered systems is to assume a particular structure for the quenched disorder on phenomenological grounds ( such as gaussian , short ranged , etc . ) and explore the consequences .",
    "assumptions about disorder structure are usually based on symmetry arguments and also the preference for simplicity , but otherwise lack theoretical substantiation .",
    "it is one of the main advantage of vulcanization theory that it can _ predict _ some generic properties of the disordered structure in vulcanized matter , as is shown in the present work , which can be used to support and sharpen the assumptions underlying more phenomenological theories .",
    "the classical theory of rubber elasticity , which was shown to be derivable from the saddle - point approximation of vulcanization theory , is known to fail to describe rubber elasticity in the intermediate and large deformation regimes @xcite . while a recent study @xcite shows that long wave - length thermal elastic fluctuations account qualitatively for this failure , on general grounds , we expect that elastic heterogeneities should play an equally important role",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to explore how the elastic heterogeneities discovered in the present work modify the macroscopic elasticity of rubbery materials .",
    "such a program is left for a future work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : rlpm ] , we analyze the semi - microscopic rlpm using the tools of vulcanization theory .",
    "specifically , we use the replica method  @xcite to study a model network consisting of randomly linked particles , which exhibits a continuous phase transition from the liquid state to the random solid state , paying particular attention to the goldstone fluctuations of the random solid state , which , as we have mentioned above , are related to the elastic shear deformations of the random solid state . in section",
    "[ sec : phen ] , we propose a nonlocal phenomenological model of a random elastic medium , and subsequently derive it from the rlpm , by identify that this phenomenological model is the low energy theory ( i.e. , it captures the goldstone fluctuations ) of the rlpm in the random solid state . through this correspondence we learn information of the statistics of the quenched random nonlocal kernel . in section",
    "[ sec : relaxation ] , we study the relaxation of the phenomenological model to a stable state for any fixed randomness ( i.e. , any realization of disorder ) , due to random stresses and attractive interactions .",
    "we re - expand the free energy about this relaxed state to obtain the true elastic theory .",
    "this relaxed reference state is , however , still randomly stressed  @xcite ; nevertheless , the stress in this state  the so - called _ residual stress_does satisfy the condition of mechanical equilibrium , viz . , @xmath0 .",
    "in its local limit , the proposed phenomenological model reproduces a version of lagrangian continuum elasticity theory that features random lam coefficients and residual stresses . in this section",
    ", we also use the phenomenological model to explore the related issue of elastic heterogeneity , viz . , the nonaffine way in which the medium responds to external stress . in section  [ sec : heterogeneity ] , we arrive at predictions for the statistics of the quenched random elastic parameters that feature in the phenomenological model in the relaxed state , along with the statistics of nonaffine deformations .",
    "thus we provide a first principles  account of the heterogeneous elasticity of soft random solids .",
    "we conclude , in section  [ sec : concdisc ] , with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "the randomly linked particle model ( rlpm ) consists of @xmath1 particles in a volume @xmath2 in @xmath3 dimensions . in order to study elasticity , including bulk deformations , @xmath2 is allowed to fluctuate under a given pressure @xmath4 .",
    "the positions of the particles in this fluctuating volume are denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the particles in the rlpm interact via two types of interactions : a repulsive interaction @xmath6 between all pairs of particles ( either direct or mediated via a solvent ) ; and an attractive interaction @xmath7 between the pairs of particles that are chosen at random to be linked .",
    "we take the latter to be a soft link ( as opposed to the usual hard constraint of vulcanization theory ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath8 the label @xmath9 , which runs from @xmath10 to the total number of links @xmath11 , indexes the links in a given realization of the quenched disorder , and specifies them via the quenched random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we take @xmath6 to be a strong , short - ranged repulsion , which serves to penalize density fluctuations and thus render the system nearly incompressible , as is appropriate for regular or polymeric liquids .",
    "as we shall describe in section  [ sec : ftmf ] , we address the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hrlpm ] ) by eliminating the particle coordinates in favor of collective fields , which have the form of joint densities of the replicas of the particles .",
    "this continuum approach enables us to focus on the physics of random particle localization , particularly at lengthscales that are relevant for such localization , which ( except when the density of links is extremely high ) are long compared with the ranges of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . with a focus on these longer lengthscales in mind , we see that it is adequate to replace the repulsive interaction @xmath13 by the model dirac delta - function excluded - volume interaction @xmath14 , characterized by the strength @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this procedure amounts to making a gradient expansion in real space ( or , equivalently , a wave vector expansion in fourier space ) of @xmath6 and retaining only the zeroth - order term ; it gives for the strength @xmath15 the value @xmath16 .",
    "terms of higher order in the gradient expansion would have a non - negligible impact on the suppression of density fluctuations only at lengthscales comparable to or shorter than the range of @xmath6 , and fluctuation modes at such lengthscales are not the ones driven via random linking to the instability associated with random localization ( and thus are not modes in need of stabilization via @xmath6 ) .",
    "we remark that the approximate interaction @xmath14 is not , in practice , singular , and is instead regularized via a high wave vector cut - off .    at our coarse - grained level of description ,",
    "the particles of the rlpm can be identified with polymers or small molecules , and the soft links can be identified with molecular chains that bind the molecules to one another .",
    "the potential for the soft links can be modeled as gaussian chains @xmath17 i.e. , a harmonic attraction , or a zero rest - length  spring , of lengthscale @xmath18 between the two particles . in making this coarse - graining one is assuming that microscopic details ( e.g. , the precise locations of the cross - links on the polymers , the internal conformational degrees of freedom of the polymers , and the effects of entanglement ) do not play significant roles for the long - wavelength physics . in part , these assumptions are justified by studying more detailed models , in which the conformational degrees of freedom of the polymers are retained  @xcite . however , we should point out that the precise form of @xmath7 is not important for long - wavelength physics and , hence , for the elastic properties that we are aiming to investigate [ cf .  the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : ftmf ] ] .    from the discussion above , the rlpm is a convenient minimal model of soft random solids , inasmuch as it adequately captures the necessary long - wavelength physics .",
    "it can be regarded as either a model of a chemical gel , or as a caricature of vulcanized rubber or other soft random solid .",
    "the rlpm can be viewed as a simplified version of vulcanization theory  @xcite , with microscopic details , such as polymer chain conformations , being ignored .",
    "nevertheless , it is able to reproduce the same universality class as vulcanization theory at the liquid - to - random - solid transition . for the study of elasticity",
    ", we shall consider length - scales on which the system is a well - defined solid ( i.e. , scales longer than the localization length ,  as we shall see later in this paper ) .",
    "both of these scales are much larger than the characteristic linear dimension of an individual polymer .",
    "the rlpm is a model very much in the spirit of lattice percolation , except that it naturally allows for particle motion as well as particle connectivity , and is therefore suitable for the study of continuum elasticity and other issues associated with the ( thermal or deformational ) motion of the constituent entities .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : hrlpm ] ) is a hamiltonian for a given realization of quenched disorder @xmath19 , which describes the particular random instance of the linking of the particles .",
    "these links are the quenched disorder of the system , which are specified at synthesis and do not change with thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is because there is a wide separation between the timescale for the linked - particle system to reach thermal equilibrium and the much longer timescale required for the links themselves to break .",
    "therefore , we treat the links as permanent .",
    "later , we shall apply the replica technique  @xcite to average over these permanent random links .      for a given volume and a given realization of disorder @xmath20 we can write the partition function @xmath21 for the rlpm as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is",
    "the excluded - volume interaction part of the hamiltonian , and @xmath24 is the partition function of the liquid in the absence of any links .",
    "the issue of the gibbs factorial factor , which is normally introduced to compensate for the overcounting of identical configuration , is a genuinely subtle one in the context of random solids ( for a discussion , see ref .",
    "however , our focus will be on observables  such as order parameter rather than on free energies , and thus the omission of the gibbs factor is of no consequence .",
    "the factor @xmath25 is associated with the link - induced attractive interaction term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the average @xmath26 , taken with respect to a boltzmann weight involving the excluded - volume interaction hamiltonian @xmath27 , is defined as @xmath28 the corresponding helmholtz free energy is then given by @xmath29    to perform the average of the free energy over the quenched disorder , we shall need to choose a probability distribution that assigns a sensible statistical weight @xmath30 to each possible realization of the total number @xmath31 and location @xmath32 of the links . following an elegant strategy due to deam and edwards  @xcite",
    ", we assume a version of the normalized link distribution as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a parameter that controls the mean total number of links .",
    "we assume that the preparation state ( i.e. , the state in which the links are going to be introduced ) is in a given volume @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 factor is actually the partition function , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition ] ) , and can be regarded as probing the equilibrium correlations of the underlying unlinked liquid .",
    "the factor @xmath37 is actually the @xmath38 value of the fourier transform of the @xmath39 function defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltreal ] ) , and we shall see later that these factors ensure that the ( mean - field ) critical point occurs at @xmath40 . the normalization factor @xmath41 is defined to be @xmath42 .",
    "the calculation for @xmath41 is straightforward , and is given in appendix  [ app : disoaver ] .",
    "the deam - edwards distribution can be understood as arising from a realistic vulcanization process in which the links are introduced simultaneously and instantaneously into the liquid state in equilibrium .",
    "specifically , it incorporates the notion that all pairs of particles that happen ( at some particular instant ) to be nearby are , with a certain probability controlled by the link density parameter @xmath34 , linked .",
    "thus , the correlations of the link distribution reflect the correlations of the unlinked liquid , and it follows that realizations of links only acquire an appreciable statistical weight if they are compatible with some reasonably probable configuration of the unlinked liquid .    the factor @xmath43 in the deam - edwards distribution introduces a poissonian character to the total number @xmath31 of links .",
    "these links are envisioned to be the product of a poisson chemical linking process .",
    "the factor @xmath36 assures that the probability of having a given random realization of links is proportional to the statistical weight for , in the unlinked liquid state , finding the to - be - linked pairs to be co - located in the liquid state to within the shape function @xmath44 .    as a result of the deam - edwards distribution , the mean number of links per particle is given by @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 is the _ mean coordination number _",
    ", i.e. , the average number of particles to which a certain particle is connected , the factor of @xmath47 results from the fact that each link is shared by two particles . for a detailed discussion of the deam - edwards distribution , see ref .  @xcite . by using this distribution of the quenched disorder",
    ", we can perform the disorder average of the helmholtz free energy via the replica technique , thus obtaining @xmath48 we now insert the deam - edwards distribution to get @xmath49 this disorder - averaged free energy differs from the form traditionally obtained via the replica technique , in that there is an extra replica @xmath36 , which originates in the deam - edwards distribution .",
    "we shall call this extra replica the @xmath50 replica , and note that it represents the _ preparation state _ of the system .",
    "the summation over the realizations of the quenched disorder @xmath20 can be performed , following the calculation in appendix  [ app : disoaver ] ; thus we arrive at the form @xmath51 which can also be expressed as @xmath52 where    @xmath53    notice that , here , the preparation state ( i.e. , @xmath50 replica ) has a fixed volume @xmath35 because , for convenience , we have assumed that the linking process was undertaken instantaneously in a liquid state of fixed volume and thus the pressure is fluctuating , whereas the measurement states ( replicas @xmath10 through @xmath54 ) are put in a fixed - pressure @xmath4 environment , the volume @xmath2 of which is allowed to fluctuate . in the latter parts of the paper we shall set the pressure @xmath4 to be the average pressure measured in the preparation state at volume @xmath35 . in particular , for a given volume of the liquid state in which the links are made , the average pressure is given by @xmath55 where we have introduced the helmholtz free energy of the unlinked liquid @xmath56 .",
    "we suppose that the excluded - volume interactions are so strong that the density fluctuations are suppressed , and the density of the unlinked liquid is just @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the mean - field value of helmholtz free energy in the unlinked liquid state is @xmath58 therefore , the mean pressure in the unlinked liquid state is given by @xmath59 from which we can identify  by the standard way in which the second virial coefficient @xmath60 appears in the free energy of the equation of state for a fluid  that @xmath60 for the unlinked liquid is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , without having actually performed a cluster expansion , we see that the dirac delta - function interaction with coefficient @xmath15 indeed leads to a virial expansion with a suitable excluded volume , viz . , @xmath62 .",
    "as mentioned above , we shall apply this pressure in the measurement states ( described by @xmath63 through @xmath64 replicas ) , and let their volumes @xmath2 fluctuate , in order to obtain an elastic free energy that can describe volume variations .",
    "in particular , by choosing the pressure @xmath65 to be exactly the mean pressure of the liquid state , we shall obtain an elastic free energy that takes the _ state right after linking _",
    ", which has the same volume @xmath35 as the liquid state , as the elastic reference state .",

    ", we have the capability of learning about the bulk modulus of the system , and to characterize volume changes caused by linking , a process that has the effect of eliminating translational degrees of freedoms .    to establish an appropriate statistical mechanics for the fixed - pressure ensemble",
    ", we shall make the following legendre transformation of the helmholtz free energy , which leads to the gibbs free energy @xmath66 :    [ eq : legetran ] @xmath67    in eq .",

    "first , it can be seen from the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : landau ] ) that near the critical point the exact form of interaction is irrelevant , because we have only kept terms to @xmath127 in @xmath120 , and this governs the long - distance physics .",

    "it is clear that if we were to change to a different potential , such as a finite - rest - length spring @xmath128 , the long - distance ( i.e. , small - momentum ) physics would be unchanged .",
    "second , as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : heterogeneity ] , neither do the statistics of the elastic modulus depend on the details of the interaction potential ; instead , they only depend on the density of links .",
    "this results from the fact that the elasticity originates in the entropy of the _ network_. the critical point for the vulcanization transition , and thus the entropic rigidity in the presence of thermal fluctuations , occurs at the same point as _ connectivity percolation _ does , rather than at the _ rigidity percolation _ critical point .",
    "the fact that we have a shear modulus scaling as @xmath129 results from the entropy of the network , and not from the factor of @xmath129 in the gaussian - chain potential , is clear because if we were to change to another attractive potential , the same results would hold for the long - distance physics .",
    "to understand the physics of the order parameter in vulcanization theory , and thus obtain the form of the stationary value of the order parameter , we need to recall the property of the hs transformation , eq .",

    "we have @xmath130 here , the @xmath131 removes the 0rs part of @xmath111 .",

    "a localized particle remains near the same spatial position in each replica .",
    "this is because , as we discussed earlier , _ each replica corresponds to a copy of the same disordered system but with independent thermal fluctuations _ , and for a particle localized as a part of the percolating cluster , it fluctuates around its fixed mean position , which is common to all replicas . according to these considerations , it is reasonable to hypothesize the following form for the stationary value of the order parameter in real space : @xmath142 to arrive at this form we have assumed that the fraction of particles that become localized is @xmath141 , and the localized single - particle density function is proportional to @xmath143 in replica @xmath77(@xmath144 ) , where @xmath145 is the random position near to which the particle is localized , and @xmath146 corresponds to the uniform contraction of the entire volume in the measurement state with respect to the preparation state , due to linking [ see the discussion following eq .",

    "we therefore elect to treat the radial variables at the classical level , which amounts to neglecting the radial fluctuations . under this condition ,",
    "the aforementioned jacobian factor does not depend on the angular variables , and therefore it contributes only a constant multiplicative factor to the functional integral , which can be safely omitted .",
