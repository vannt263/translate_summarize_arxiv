    "vacuum photo - multipliers ( pmts ) are the most popular photo - detectors .",
    "they have high sensitivity , single photo - electron resolution , high counting rate , large area , good time resolution .",
    "there is an enormous experience in pmt applications in different fields .",
    "however pmts have also drawbacks : sensitivity to magnetic field , large size and low granularity , low quantum efficiency ( @xmath0 ) , need of high voltage .",
    "they are also quite expensive .",
    "these drawbacks can be partially cured .",
    "multi - anode pmts ( mapmt ) offer higher granularity .",
    "micro channel plate pmt can work to some extent in magnetic fields .",
    "recently pmts with high ( @xmath1 ) quantum efficiency have been developed @xcite .",
    "however , only solid state detectors can provide a cardinal solution of the problems .",
    "they are insensitive to magnetic field and compact .",
    "they have very high quantum efficiency and granularity .",
    "solid state photo - detectors can be much cheaper than pmts .",
    "the simplest photo - detector is a pin photo - diode .",
    "it has no amplification and therefore it is very stable .",
    "pin photo - diodes have a high ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0 well matched to the csi(tl ) emission spectrum which peaks at @xmath3 nm .",
    "therefore they have been used in large quantity in many calorimeters including cleo , belle , babar , and glast .",
    "however a thick ( @xmath4 m ) sensitive layer leads to a large nuclear counting effect . charged particles crossing the sensitive layer produce a large number of electron - hole pairs and mimic a large energy deposition in a scintillator .",
    "absence of amplification prevents usage of pin photo - diodes with low light yield scintillators .",
    "these two problems are solved in avalanche photo diodes ( apd ) . in apd photo - electrons ( p.e . )",
    "are produced in a thin ( @xmath5 m ) sensitive layer amplified in avalanches at a p - n junction .",
    "about 120 thousand apds are used in the cms calorimeter@xcite .",
    "excellent resolution has been achieved in spite of a low photon yield of pbwo4 crystals .",
    "because of avalanche amplification apds have a large excess noise factor ( enf ) which grows with the amplification .",
    "voltage and temperature sensitivities of the amplification also grow with the amplification .",
    "therefore it is difficult to operate apds at amplifications above a few hundred .    at a high over - voltage ( @xmath6 ) the avalanche amplification transforms into a geiger discharge . in this mode",
    "a photo - diode response does not depend on a number of initial photo - electrons .",
    "however it is possible to restore the proportionality of the response to the initial number of p.e . by splitting a photo - diode into a large number of independent pixels connected to the same output .",
    "the number of fired pixels is proportional to the number of initial p.e .",
    "as long as it is small in comparison with the total number of pixels in a photo - diode . for larger signals",
    "the response becomes nonlinear and saturates at the total number of pixels in the photo - diode .",
    "such multi - pixel photo - diodes working in the geiger mode have been developed in russia@xcite .",
    "now they are produced by many companies which use different names for their products : sipm , mrs apd , mppc , mapd , etc .",
    "we will use a generic name sipm for all of them .",
    "we will discuss sipm properties using as an example the mephi - pulsar ( mephi ) sipm .",
    "there is by far the largest experience in using such sipms in real experiments .",
    "about 8 thousand of them were used in the calice hadron calorimeter prototype for ilc@xcite which was tested during the last 3 years at cern and fnal .",
    "mephi sipm is a matrix of 1156 pixels with the size @xmath7m@xmath8 .",
    "the sipm sensitive area is @xmath9mm@xmath8 .",
    "the pixels have individual polysilicon quenching resistors of a few @xmath10 necessary to break off the geiger discharge .",
    "sipms are reversely biased with a voltage of about 50v which is about 3v higher than the breakdown voltage ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "sipm gain ( g ) is determined by a charge released in one pixel discharge which is proportional to a pixel capacitance ( c ) and @xmath6 : @xmath12 .",
    "typical values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 lead to @xmath15fc .",
    "so one p.e . produces a signal of about @xmath16 electrons .",
    "this is very similar to a usual pmt .",
    "the relative gain variation @xmath17 is proportional to the relative @xmath6 variation .",
    "therefore sipms operated at smaller @xmath6s like hamamatsu mppcs have larger gain sensitivity to the voltage variation and require a better voltage stabilization .",
    "a decrease of temperature by @xmath18 leads to the decrease of the breakdown voltage of the mephi sipm by @xmath19v and hence to the increase of the gain .",
    "therefore it is desirable to keep temperature variations small .",
    "photon detection efficiency ( @xmath20 ) is a product of @xmath0 , a geometrical efficiency ( @xmath21 ) , and a probability for a charge carrier to initiate the geiger discharge ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 @xmath0 is about 80% at @xmath24 nm . the geometrical efficiency is a fraction of a sipm area which is sensitive",
    ". it decreases with the decrease of a pixel size since the area of separating boarders between pixels grows .",
    "the geometrical efficiency of modern sipms can be as large as 70% for @xmath25 m pixels .",
    "the probability of the geiger discharge increases with the @xmath6 .",
    "it grows almost linearly at small @xmath6s but then saturates .",
    "this leads to a similar behavior of @xmath20 .",
    "electrons have a much higher probability to trigger the geiger discharge in the p - n junction than holes",
    ". therefore sipms with a n - p structure are more sensitive to a green light than to a blue light . a blue light ( green light ) is absorbed in the n - layer ( p - layer ) ; the carriers which move to the p - n junction are holes ( electrons ) and the probability to trigger the discharge is low ( high ) . in order to increase the sensitivity for blue light the n - layer should be made as thin as possible .",
    "another possibility is to use a p - n structure .",
    "[ musienko ] shows examples of @xmath20 spectral dependence for different sipms@xcite .",
    "some electrons and holes produced in the discharge can be trapped and then released when the discharge is already quenched .",
    "this leads to after - pulses if the pixel has sufficient time to recharge ( see fig .",
    "[ afterpulse]@xcite ) .",
    "the after - pulses which come soon after the initial signal have smaller amplitudes ( see fig.[afterpulse ] ) since the pixel voltage is not completely restored . majority of after - pulses come soon after the initial signal with a decay time of about 18ns@xcite .",
    "however there is also a fraction with a longer decay time @xmath26ns .",
    "the decay times become shorter at higher temperatures@xcite .",
    "the after - pulse probability is proportional to the number of electrons in the discharge ( i.e. to the gain ) and the probability to trigger the geiger discharge .",
    "therefore it grows roughly as the second power of the @xmath6 .",
    "the pixel recovery time depends on the pixel capacitance and quenching resistor ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "it can not be much smaller than @xmath28ns since the quenching resistor can not be small .",
    "for such small recovery times the pixel can be fired more than once during a long light pulse coming for example from a scintillator .",
    "this increases the dynamic range of a sipm .",
    "however it also makes the response dependent on the shape of the light pulse .",
    "this complicates the calibration procedures .",
    "majority of sipm types have longer recovery time @xmath29s .",
    "the sipm dead time is much smaller since the number of pixels is large .",
    "therefore sipms can tolerate high counting rates .",
    "an led signal was well seen in a scintillator strip with a sipm readout when we irradiated it with a @xmath30 source up to a counting rate of @xmath31khz ( @xmath32a ) .",
    "photons are created in the geiger discharge with a rate of @xmath33/electron at @xmath34m@xcite .",
    "low energy photons have a long absorption length up to @xmath35 mm at @xmath36 m and can produce p.e . in neighboring pixels .",
    "this leads to the inter - pixel cross - talk .",
    "photo - electrons can be produced in the pixel active region or in the bulk .",
    "therefore there is a prompt and delayed component in the cross - talk@xcite .",
    "the prompt component can be suppressed by trenches between pixels .",
    "the delayed component can be suppressed by an additional p - n junction .",
    "this is nicely demonstrated by the mephi - mpi ( munich ) group .",
    "such double cross - talk suppression allowed them to reduce the cross talk to below 1% level at the amplification of @xmath37@xcite .",
    "modern industrially produced sipms have cross - talk values at working @xmath6s of 5 - 10% .",
    "the cross talk and after - pulses lead to the increase of enf which is however still much closer to 1 than in apd or even pmt .      the sipm response is a product of several factors . for small light pulses it is given by    @xmath38 + where @xmath39 is the cross - talk probability , and",
    "@xmath40 is the after - pulse probability multiplied by the average after - pulse amplitude suppression . for large light signals the saturation due to limited number of pixels becomes important .",
    "since the @xmath20 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 all grow with @xmath6 , the sipm response grows very non - linearly .",
    "[ sipmparam ] shows mephi sipm parameter dependence on the bias voltage .",
    "the mephi sipm response at the working point selected for the calice application varies by @xmath42v and @xmath43@xcite . at higher @xmath6",
    "the sensitivity of the sipm response to variations of the bias voltage and temperature is weaker .",
    "sipms have a quite high dark rate originating from charge carriers thermally created in the sensitive volume .",
    "the typical dark rate is 1 - 2mhz / mm@xmath8 at room temperature .",
    "the dark rate decreases by a factor of 2 with the temperature decrease by @xmath44 .",
    "hamamatsu sipms have considerably smaller dark rate",
    ". the dark rate grows linearly with the @xmath6 because of the increase in the probability for charge carriers to trigger the geiger discharge .",
    "the sipm response is intrinsically very fast due to a very fast geiger discharge development in a thin ( @xmath451 - 2@xmath46 m ) depletion layer .",
    "the single p.e .",
    "timing resolution of about 0.1ns has been observed@xcite .",
    "the timing resolution improves as @xmath47 .",
    "sipms are not sensitive to a magnetic field .",
    "this was tested up to 4 t for the mephi sipms .",
    "the sipm response , gain , cross - talk , and noise frequency did not change in the magnetic field within the measurement accuracy@xcite .",
    "this feature is extremely important for many sipm applications",
    ".      the sipm dark current grows linearly with the particle flux as in other silicon detectors@xcite .",
    "however , since the initial single photoelectron resolution of sipms is by far better than that of say apd , it starts to suffer earlier .",
    "the radiation induced dark current in a sipm is described by the following formula :    @xmath48 + where f is the particle flux , @xmath49a / cm@xcite , @xmath50 is a sipm area , @xmath51 is the effective thickness from which charge carriers are collected , @xmath52 is the energy dependent conversion factor of radiation damage of different particle species to that of 1@xmath53mev neutrons .",
    "fig.[pirrad ] shows the dark current dependence on proton fluence for mephi and cpta-149 sipms at the same @xmath20 ( @xmath54 ) for the green light .",
    "mev protons , circles ) and cpta mrs - apd ( 80@xmath53mev protons , stars ) operated at the same @xmath20 .",
    "each star corresponds to a different mrs - apd measured after about 1 day after the irradiation .",
    "circles below @xmath55 flux show the current of one sipm measured online .",
    "other circles correspond to different sipm samples measured about 1 day after the irradiation.,width=188 ]    the cpta detectors show about 2 times smaller current increase .",
    "moreover they were irradiated with 80mev protons which have @xmath56 while the mephi sipms were irradiated with 200mev protons which have @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the effective thickness of the sensitive layer derived from this measurements is 5 times smaller for the cpta detector .",
    "it is about @xmath58 m while the mephi sipm has @xmath59 m .",
    "one can conclude that the cpta mrs - apd is less vulnerable to the radiation damage .",
    "however , if one operates the cpta mrs - apd at @xmath20=30% the dark current increases even a bit faster than in the mephi sipm .    the annealing effect at a room temperature after the proton irradiation is small . the current drops by about 35% in 30 days after the irradiation with @xmath60 protons / cm@xmath8 with e=80mev",
    "relative annealing speed does not depend on the dose up to this flux which is equivalent to @xmath62 @xmath63mev neutrons / cm@xmath8 .",
    "when the dark current reaches @xmath64a individual photo - electron peaks in the sipm response become smeared . however sipm can be operated at much higher currents .",
    "it was demonstrated@xcite that the gain , @xmath20 , @xmath11 , @xmath27 , and a pixel recovery time of sipms do not change after the irradiation with @xmath55/cm@xmath8 protons with e=82mev which is equivalent to @xmath65/cm@xmath8 of @xmath63mev neutrons .",
    "this was checked for 5 types of sipms from different producers .",
    "sipms are less sensitive to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "for example 10 sipms from mephi , cpta , and hamamatsu were irradiated with a @xmath66 source@xcite .",
    "all 10 were still operational after 200krad irradiation .",
    "the dark current of 1600 pixel mppc(11 - 025 m ) increased considerably after the irradiation but dropped to reasonably small values after annealing at a room temperature ( see fig.[eirrad]@xcite ) .",
    "the dark current was smaller ( 1 - 3@xmath67a after 500krad ) for 9 other sipms including 400 pixel mppc(s10362 - 11 - 050u ) .",
    "they were operational even after a @xmath31krad dose .",
    "the reason for the fast increase of the current in 1600 pixel mppc is not clear .",
    "one should keep in mind that only one sample was irradiated and more systematic tests are needed .",
    "the large dependence of the radiation hardness on the sipm type ( if confirmed ) would require detailed radiation studies for each sipm type .",
    "source at t=0 ( 200krad ) and t=200 hours ( 200 krad).,width=188 ]      the calice hadronic calorimeter with 7620 mephi sipms has been operated at cern and fnal during more than 6 months .",
    "we have not observed any increase in the number of dead sipms within the measurement uncertainty of about 0.1% .",
    "we also have not observed any major change in the sipm parameters .",
    "however a more quantitative analysis of their performance is still to be performed .",
    "so far sipms from 3 producers have been used in quantity for experiments : mephi sipms ( calice hadronic calorimeter@xcite ) , hamamatsu mppcs ( calice electromagnetic calorimeter@xcite ) and cpta mrs apds ( alice tof test set - up@xcite ) .",
    "properties of these photo - detectors are compared in fig .",
    "[ comparison]@xcite .",

    "they are labeled as efficiencies for `` blue '' and `` green '' light .",
    "@xmath73 of mppc and mrs apd are very similar for the green light .",
    "they are considerably higher than the @xmath20 of the mephi sipm .",
    "the blue enhanced mrs apd has the @xmath20 similar to mppc one but it has much higher dark noise rate .",
    "the cross - talk is comparable in the 1600 pixel mppc and mrs apd .",
    "it is much higher in the mephi sipm and 400 pixel mppc .",
    "so the mephi sipm has worse parameters than the more modern mppc and mrs apd .",
    "nevertheless it was already adequate for mass applications in calorimetry .",
    "a small 108 channel hadron calorimeter prototype for the international linear collider ( ilc ) was the first `` mass '' application of sipms in a real experiment@xcite .",
    "it consisted of @xmath74@xmath75 scintillator tiles with wls fiber and mephi sipms installed directly in the tile .",
    "the signals of about 20 p.e./mip were transported directly without any preamplifier to the lecroy 2249a adcs via 25 m long coaxial cables . since there was only very limited experience with sipms at that time two identical calorimeters with different photo - detectors",
    "were tested simultaneously .",
    "one of them used a well established technique of mapmts .",
    "another one was based on a relatively new apd readout .",
    "all three calorimeters demonstrated adequate and practically identical performance .",
    "results from the calorimeter with the novel sipm read - out were obtained first because the calibration was based on the response measurements using the distance between signals with different number of p.e . which are well resolved by sipms@xcite .",
    "results from the calorimeter with mapmt readout were obtained also fast@xcite .",
    "analysis and calibration of the apd data took much longer@xcite . the very encouraging experience with the novel sipm readout resulted in a selection of sipms as a baseline for the ilc analogue hadron calorimeter .",
    "the calice scintillator hadron calorimeter prototype consists of 7620 scintillator tiles with wls fibers and mephi sipms@xcite .",
    "all sipms were thoroughly tested before installation into the tiles@xcite .",
    "the bias voltage was adjusted to get the same number of pixels per mip .",
    "sipms which had too large cross - talk or noise , too low gain or fluctuating dark current were rejected .",
    "many other parameters were also measured but they were found to be mainly within the required limits and practically did not result in additional rejection .",
    "the calorimeter was tested during 2006 - 2008 at cern and fnal .",
    "it worked very reliably practically without problem during more than 6 months . only about 1% of sipms were not operational .",
    "majority of them were from the initial production when the selection procedure was not yet fully developed .",
    "we can conclude that the experience with the first mass use of sipms in the real experiment is very encouraging .",
    "the next engineering prototype is being built now@xcite .",
    "it will have readout chips installed on very compact pcbs inside the active calorimeter layer .",
    "the scintillator tiles with wls fibers will be only 3 mm thick in order to minimize the gaps in the absorber .",
    "we plan to use cpta mrs apds .",
    "they have a higher @xmath20 and smaller cross - talk than the mephi sipms used in the present prototype ( see fig.[comparison ] ) .",
    "the engineering prototype will be scalable for the mass production of a few million channel calice hadron calorimeter .",
    "the calice collaboration investigates also a possibility to use blue sensitive sipms for a direct read - out of scintillator tiles without wls fibers .",

    "scintillator strips with wls fiber and mapmt readout is a well established technique for muon detection .",
    "this technique was successfully used in the minos and opera neutrino detectors .",
    "it was shown that by switching to a sipm readout one gets more p.e./mip and simplifies the technique considerably@xcite .",
    "because of insensitivity to a magnetic field this technique can be used in collider detectors .",
    "a new muon and @xmath79 end cap detector is designed now for the superbelle experiment .",
    "it will consist of 28 thousand scintillator strips up to 3 meter long@xcite .",

    ". it will provide more than 10p.e . from the far end of @xmath80@xmath75 scintillator strips and a small noise rate .",
    "the time resolution of about 1ns allows the determination of the coordinate along the strip with about 15 cm accuracy .",
    "similar approach can be used for the muon system of the future international linear collider@xcite .    using two sipms per a scintillator tile",
    "it is possible to build a muon system with a negligible noise rate .",
    "this feature is very useful for cosmic muon test set - ups .",
    "the cosmic ray test set - up for the alice tof system is based on @xmath81@xmath75 scintillator tiles with the wls fiber and two mrs apd read out@xcite .",
    "about 500 mrs apds ( including spare modules ) are used in this effectively working system .      the t2k neutrino oscillation experiment in japan plans to use sipms",
    "practically in all subsystems@xcite .",
    "altogether about 50 thousand hamamatsu mppcs ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) will be used .",
    "more than 30 thousand of them have been already produced and about 15 thousand have been tested .",
    "tested mppcs show very good uniformity of parameters .",

    "we plan to use the cpta mrs apds for the read - out .",
    "we have observed about 10 p.e./mip in the 2 mm thick strips .    the excellent single photon resolution , high quantum efficiency , low mass , and low bias voltage make sipms an interesting alternative to standard pmts in dark matter detection in liquid xenon .",
