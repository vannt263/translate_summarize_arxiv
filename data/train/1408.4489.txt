    "the dynamical behavior of fluids at nanoscale has been attracting attention recently .",
    "the reason behind this attention is that the liquids under nano confinement exhibit hydrodynamic , dynamic and structural properties different from the mesoscopic confined and bulk systems  @xcite . for instance , the fast flow of the liquids confined in nano structures can not be described by the classical hydrodynamic  @xcite .",
    "this inconsistence between the experiments and the classical theories become even more significative in anomalous liquids , such as water  @xcite , where the enhancement flow is higher than the enhancement observed in other fluids   @xcite . in the particular case of water ,",
    "this unusual dynamics might lead to important technological applications in desalinization  @xcite .    for anomalous liquids , as water",
    ", the confinement produces additional properties such as : the presence of a well defined layered structure  @xcite , crystallization of the contact layers at high temperatures  @xcite , the increase of the diffusion coefficient with the increase of the confinement  @xcite and the oscilatory behavior in the superflow   @xcite .",
    "what are the bulk properties in anomalous fluids that under confinement might lead to the appearance of unusual dynamics effects ?",
    "most liquids contract upon cooling .",
    "this is not the case of the anomalous liquids . for them",
    "the specific volume at ambient pressure starts to increase when cooled below a certain temperature .",
    "in addition , while most liquids diffuse faster as pressure and density decreases and contract on cooling , anomalous liquids exhibits a maximum density at constant pressure , and the diffusion coefficient increases under compression  @xcite . the most well know anomalous fluid is water  @xcite , but te  @xcite , ga , bi  @xcite , si  @xcite , @xmath0  @xcite , liquid metals  @xcite , graphite  @xcite , silica  @xcite , silicon  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite also show the presence of thermodynamic anomalies  @xcite .",
    "in addition to water  @xcite , silica  @xcite and silicon  @xcite exhibit a maximum in the diffusion coefficient at constant temperature . as well",
    ", colloidal systems and globular proteins can also exhibit anomalous properties  @xcite .    the diffusion coefficient , in bulk ,",
    "is obtained from the scaling factor between the mean square displacement and the exponent of the time , namely @xmath2 . for the anomalous liquids in the bulk",
    "this scale factor follows the fick diffusion .",
    "that means that the mean square displacement is linear with time , @xmath3 . as the system becomes confined in addition to the fickian dynamics two anomalous no - fickian behaviors",
    "are observed .",
    "the first , the superdiffusive regime , complies all the @xmath4 cases with a fast dynamics .",
    "the limit is an ideal system where the molecules can move with constant velocity and , therefore , ballistic diffusion , @xmath5 .",
    "the second , the subdiffusive regime , includes dense systems in which the dynamics is slower and the particles move in a chain - like structure and can not pass each other forming a single - file diffusion with @xmath6 .",
    "the transition between these regimes was observed in fluids confined inside nanotubes , and depends on the radius and length of the nanotube as well as on the time of observation of the moviment  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the dynamics is related with the structure .    in this paper",
    "we explore the connection between the dynamic and structural anomalous behavior in nanoconfined systems suggesting that the layering structure governs the dynamic transition .",
    "we propose that for very high pressures the transition between fickian to superdiffusive is related with the structural transition between two to three layers .",
    "the fluid is modeled using a two length scale potential .",
    "coarse graining potentials are a suitable tool to investigate the properties of a general confined anomalous fluids .",
    "recently we have shown that this effective potential is capable to reproduce the enhancent flow and the high diffusion coefficient of nanoconfined anomalous fluids  @xcite . for small pressures the structure",
    "is related to thermodynamic phase transitions in the wall  @xcite .",
