    "a three - dimensional quantum system ( a qutrit ) is the simplest system capable of exhibiting quantum contextuality .",
    "the first proof of state - independent contextuality ( sic ) was given by kochen and specker ( ks ) using 117 rays in 1967 , now renowned as the ks theorem  @xcite .",
    "the ks theorem rules out noncontextual hidden variable models and demonstrates that quantum mechanics is essentially contextual .",
    "the rays form a set to test contextualtiy in a state - independent way . later on peres",
    "reported a 33-ray proof  @xcite , conway and kochen reported a 31-ray proof  @xcite , followed by yu and oh  @xcite who reduced the required number of observables to a record - breaking 13 rays and gave the state - independent proof of the ks theorem . in three dimensions , it has been proven that 13 is the minimal number of observables by cabello  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "a ray in the three - dimensional hilbert space is described by a complex vector @xmath6 are real parameters .",
    "the rays are usually taken as real - valued , i.e. , all phase factors vanish ( e.g. , see the literature mentioned above ) , since they can be conveniently viewed as vectors in the three - dimensional euclid space and applied to practical experiments . very recently ,",
    "bengtsson , blanchfield , and cabello ( bbc ) suggested that it would have advantages if the rays are taken as complex vectors , and they proposed 21 complex vectors to detect sic  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a set of @xmath7 rays ( unnormalized ) , which we recast into three classes as follows :    [ ray ] @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a @xmath1-th root of unity , and @xmath10",
    ". in general , the first class contains @xmath11 vectors , the second contains @xmath12 , and the third contains @xmath13 , hence the total @xmath14 vectors . by a direct calculation ,",
    "let @xmath15 , then from eq .",
    "( [ ray ] ) one obtains the yu - oh 13 rays :    @xmath16    and let @xmath17 , one obtains 21 vectors equivalent to those in bbc s proposal .    remarkably , the yu - oh sic set and the bbc sic set share a unified structure as in eq .",
    "( [ ray ] ) .",
    "this raises a natural question : what if @xmath1 is arbitrary ? in this paper , we shall address this question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we shall study the problem by the ramanathan - horodecki ( rh ) criterion  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we calculate the fractional chromatic number @xmath18 up to @xmath5 .",
    "we find that for @xmath5 , the set is not sic , and that for @xmath4 , we can construct an explicit inequality to identify sic . in sec .",
    "iii , we shall use the inequality criterion to study the problem . to be specific",
    ", we calculate the quantum violation of the maximally mixed state ( mms ) and find that when @xmath3 the sets are sic . in the last section , we make a discussion and conclusion .",
    "given a set of rays , they can be represented as an exclusivity graph @xmath19 whose vertices stand for rays and two vertices are connected if and only if the corresponding two rays are orthogonal  @xcite .",
    "recently ramanathan and horodecki proposed a necessary condition  @xcite for a set of rays to be sic for dimension @xmath20 @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the fractional chromatic number of the exclusivity graph  @xcite . to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we briefly review the chromatic number @xmath23 and fractional chromatic number @xmath22 .",
    "an @xmath24-coloring of a graph @xmath19 is an assignment of @xmath24 colors to vertices so that adjacent vertices receive different colors .",
    "the chromatic number of @xmath19 , denoted @xmath23 , is the least @xmath24 for which @xmath19 has an @xmath24-coloring .",
    "a @xmath25-coloring of a graph @xmath19 is an assignment of sets of size @xmath26 out of @xmath27 available colors to vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices receive disjoint sets .",
    "the @xmath26-fold chromatic number @xmath28 is the least @xmath27 such that an @xmath25-coloring exists .",
    "the fractional chromatic number @xmath22 is defined to be @xmath29 note that @xmath30 can be obtained at a finite @xmath26 .    as an example , let us consider a pentagon graph , for which @xmath31 ( see fig .",

    "-coloring ( right ) for pentagon.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for eq .",
    "( [ ray ] ) , there are @xmath14 rays for a contextual test .",
    "such rays form an exclusivity graph with @xmath7 vertices through the orthogonal relations of these vectors .",
    "the key point to use the rh criterion is to calculate @xmath22 . if @xmath32 , then the set is not sic . in table",
    "i , we have computed @xmath18 up to @xmath5 within our strength . based on the rh criterion",
    ", one can confirm the set with @xmath5 is not sic .",
    ".@xmath18 for @xmath33 .",

    "the algebraic relation @xmath36 vectors in the third class could be orthogonal .",
    "this is different from _",
    "case 1_. it is easy to see that the solution to @xmath37 is @xmath38    two rays @xmath39 are orthogonal if and only if @xmath40 .",
    "we have @xmath41 or @xmath42 so , @xmath43 form a complete orthogonal basis for each @xmath44 .",
    "thus only one of them should appear in the independent set .",
    "totally , there are @xmath45 rays can be chosen at most in the third class .",
    "if @xmath46 is chosen in the second class , then @xmath47 can not be chosen for every @xmath48 ; if @xmath49 is chosen in the second class , then @xmath47 can not be chosen for every @xmath50 ; if @xmath51 is chosen in the second class , then @xmath47 can not be chosen for every @xmath52 . to find the independence of the vectors in the second and third classes",
    ", one can choose @xmath1 rays from the second class and @xmath53 from the third class ( in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have plotted how to choose rays in the third class for @xmath54 ) , hence @xmath55 rays in total .",
    "explicitly , the maximal independent set of @xmath55 rays are as follows :    * choose none from the first class ; * choose @xmath56 for @xmath57 ; * choose @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",

    "in summary , we have presented a generalized set of rays in terms of parameter @xmath0 ( cf .",

    "when @xmath2 , the set corresponds to the yu - oh set and the bbc set , respectively .",
    "based on the rh criterion and the violation of inequality ( [ inequality ] ) , we have proven that the sets with @xmath3 and @xmath4 are sic , while the set with @xmath5 is not .",
    "thus our generalized set of rays will enrich the study of sic proof , and stimulate the new application to quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "let us make a discussion to end this paper . in comparison to inequality ( [ inequality ] )",
    ", the more general inequality is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 are weights .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper we have only considered the case where all weights are unity . by adjusting the weights ,",
