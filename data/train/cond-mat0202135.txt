    "the random @xmath0-state potts model@xcite in two - dimensions has recently been the subject of extensive study .",
    "one reason for this interest is that disorder even changes the _ order _ of the transition for @xmath5 , where it is first order in the pure case but must be continuous@xcite in two - dimensions for all-@xmath0 .",
    "another reason interest is the prediction by ludwig@xcite , later confirmed by numerical simulations@xcite , of multi - fractal exponents at the critical point .",
    "although there has been a lot of numerical work on the static critical exponents@xcite , there has been less on the dynamics , though there have been some recent studies based on the `` short - time dynamics''@xcite approach .",
    "here we perform a careful analysis of the dynamics of the potts model in two dimensions by monte carlo simulations .",
    "our motivation is two - fold :    firstly , cardy@xcite has raised the possibility that , at least for certain types of dynamics , one might have _ activated _ dynamical scaling , in which the log of the characteristic time @xmath3 ( i.e. the barrier height ) varies with a power of an appropriate length scale @xmath6 i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the `` barrier '' exponent .",
    "this is in contrast to _ conventional _ dynamical scaling in which @xmath3 itself varies with a power of @xmath6 . i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dynamical exponent",
    ". activated dynamics has been proposed by fisher@xcite for the random field ising model where the fixed point ( of the renormalization group ) is at @xmath11 .",
    "first order transitions can also be described by a @xmath11 fixed point and also have activated dynamics . in that case",
    "the barrier exponent @xmath8 is equal to @xmath12 for a discrete broken symmetry , where @xmath13 is the dimension , so @xmath14 here .",
    "we study two values of @xmath0 : @xmath1 where the pure system has a second order transition and so activated dynamics seems unlikely for the random case , and @xmath2 where the pure system has a first order transition so there is a greater possibility that the random problem will have activated dynamics .",
    "the size of the first order jump increases as @xmath0 gets large , and we find that we need @xmath15 to clearly see activated dynamics for the _ pure _ system for the range of sizes studied .",
    "hence , for the _ random _ case , we take a rather large number of potts states , @xmath2 , since activated dynamics is easily seen in this case for the pure system , so we feel we have a good chance of seeing it in the random case too , if it occurs . in fact , we find conventional dynamical scaling for both values of @xmath0 , but , as we shall discuss , have some concern as whether this is the true asymptotic behavior for @xmath16 .",
    "secondly , there has recently been considerable discussion about lack of self averaging for static quantities in random systems at the critical point .",
    "it is found@xcite that if disorder is irrelevant , then the relative variance , @xmath17 , of a static quantity @xmath18 tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit like @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lattice size , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the specific heat and correlation length exponents , respectively .",
    "this is called weak self averaging . however",
    ", if disorder is relevant then @xmath17 tends to a universal constant , indicating lack of self - averaging . in this paper",
    "we consider the question of self averaging for _ dynamics _ , which has not been discussed before , to our knowledge .",
    "disorder is relevant for both values of @xmath0 that we study , and yet we find rather different distributions of the relaxation time @xmath3 in the two cases . for @xmath1",
    "we find a finite relative variance for @xmath3 but , perhaps surprisingly , for @xmath2 this appears to diverge in the thermodynamic limit and it is @xmath4 which has a finite relative variance .",

    "the couplings , @xmath27 , are positive , and include the factor of @xmath28 .",
    "they are independent random variables , drawn from a probability distribution , @xmath29 .    for the pure case ,",
    "the system is at criticality if the `` dual coupling '' @xmath30 , defined by@xcite @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . for the random case it is possible to choose a self - dual _ distribution _ of the couplings to ensure that the system is at the critical point .",
    "we take the distribution suggested by olson and young@xcite ( oy ) since this is both very broad ( so the system is far from the pure fixed point ) , and also does not have a substantial weight near @xmath35 ( so the system is far from the percolation fixed point ) . in terms of @xmath36 , the oy distribution is@xcite @xmath37 to generate random numbers with probability @xmath38 one takes @xmath39 to be @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a random number with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 . we expect that the same results would be obtained asymptotically for _ any _ reasonable distribution .",
    "however , to verify this would require a very large computational effort , since other distributions are likely to have larger corrections to scaling than the oy distribution , and so would need simulations on larger lattices than we have been able to study here .",
    "we have some preliminary results for a binary distribution which are similar to those presented here for the oy distribution , but a much larger computational effort would be needed to verify convincingly that the two distributions are indeed in the same universality class .",

    "in addition to results for the _ average _ decay of the magnetization , we also discuss the _ distribution _ of relaxation times of the total magnetization .",
    "since we want to use a realistic form for the dynamics , we use standard monte carlo methods rather than one of the more efficient cluster algorithms@xcite that reduce critical slowing down .",
    "we expect that any `` local '' dynamics would give the same results , but that cluster algorithms , in which the average size of the cluster of flipped spins diverges at the critical point , would yield faster dynamics , as indeed they are designed to do .",
