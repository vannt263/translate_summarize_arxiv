    "the parton distributions in proton have been studied extensively in recent years over wide ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for example , in the cteq global analysis framework @xcite the distribution functions have been determined by fitting some 1300 data points obtained for various reactions in 16 experiments ; over 30 parameters are used in the input parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) in the next - to - leading -order calculations in perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the results on the pdf s at various @xmath0 are presented in the form of graphs available on the web @xcite .",
    "the distribution functions are accurately calculated numerically , but they are inconvenient to describe analytically .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "one is to provide a simple parameterization of the parton distribution functions that is accurate to within 5% for @xmath3 ( gev / c)@xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the other is to provide firm evidence for the validity of a model that can be very useful in the study of soft processes in hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "the model under discussion is the valon model @xcite .",
    "valons play a role in scattering problems as the constituent quarks do in bound - state problems . in the model",
    "it is assumed that the valons stand at a level in between hadrons and partons and that the structure of a hadron in terms of the valons is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , the property that a nucleon has three valons which carry all the momentum of the nucleon does not change with @xmath0 .",
    "each valon may be viewed as a parton cluster associated with one and only one valence quark , so the flavor quantum numbers of a valon are those of a valence quark .",
    "the @xmath0 evolution of the parton distributions in a nucleon is effected through the evolution of the valon structure , as the higher resolution of a probe reveals the parton content of the valons .    when the valon model was first proposed , the deep inelastic scattering data was not precise enough either to rule out the model or to determine accurately the parameters in the model .",
    "one may regard the situation then as one in which the model satisfies the sufficiency condition for an approximate description of the nucleon structure , but not necessary .",
    "now , the experimental data have vastly improved and the pdf s have been so precisely determined that the validity of the valon model can be put to a stringent test .",
    "that is what we intend to do in this paper .",
    "although no model is ever necessary in the mathematical sense , we shall show that the concept of valons as constituents of the nucleon is eminently acceptable by virtue of the @xmath0 independence of the valon distribution functions , the universality of the parton distributions in valons , and the momentum sum rule of the partons in a valon being satisfied .    in terms of the parameterization in the valon model",
    "the parton distributions are much simpler to describe and therefore more convenient to transport to different problems",
    ". our focus will be on soft processes at low @xmath0 , for which perturbative qcd is inapplicable .",
    "the valon picture then provides a systematic way of organizing various contributions to inclusive processes .",
    "one such problem is the study of proton - nucleus collisions in which the degradation of the momenta of the produced nucleons can be well described in the valon model @xcite .",
    "the new parameterizations determined in this paper will affect the details of the model , for which we have previously made simplifying assumptions .",
    "the application of the results obtained now will not be considered here .",
    "we mention such applications here only to motivate our concentration in the range @xmath3 ( gev / c)@xmath4 in this paper .",
    "in the valon model we assume that a proton consists of three valons @xmath6 , which separately contain the three valence quarks @xmath7 .",
    "let the exclusive valon distribution function be @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the momentum fractions of the @xmath10 valons @xmath11 and @xmath12 valon @xmath13 .",
    "the variable @xmath14 will never refer to rapidity in this paper .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath15 is determined by the requirement that the probability for the proton to consist of three and only three valons is one , i.e. , @xmath16 note that the valon distribution function is not defined in the invariant phase space . from eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) we have @xmath17^{-1 } , \\label{2.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the beta function .",
    "the single - valon distributions are @xmath19 @xmath20    an essential property of the valon model is that the structure of the proton in terms of the valons is independent of the probe .",
    "it means that when probed at high @xmath0 , whatever the experiment may be , the parton distributions in a proton can be expressed as a convolution of the valon distribution and the parton distribution in a valon , i.e. , @xmath21 , \\label{2.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath22 , \\label{2.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the @xmath25 and @xmath26 quark distributions , respectively , and @xmath2 the momentum fraction of the quark .",
    "we emphasize that on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of the above equations the @xmath0 dependences appear only in parton distributions in the valons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but not in the valon distributions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we regard this as the defining property of the valon model . in that sense",
    "the model is analogous to the one in which a deuteron is treated as a bound state of two nucleons ; in that treatment a high-@xmath0 probe resolves the structure of one or the other nucleon without affecting the nucleon wave function of the deuteron .",
    "there are two types of parton distributions in the valons that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
    "@xmath31 refers to the favored partons , i.e. , @xmath25 in @xmath10 and @xmath26 in @xmath12 , whereas @xmath32 refers to the unfavored partons , i.e. , @xmath25 in @xmath12 and @xmath26 in @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution @xmath33 can be further divided into two types @xmath34 where the first term on the rhs is the valence quark distribution ( hence , non - singlet ) , while the second is the sea quark distribution for the same flavor type .",
    "since the sea quarks should respect charge conjugation invariance , the @xmath25 and @xmath35 in the sea ( and similarly @xmath26 and @xmath36 ) have the same distributions , i.e. , @xmath37 , \\label{2.8a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38 .",

    "( [ 2.8a ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) results in @xmath44 , which is a necessary consequence of the sea quarks satisfying @xmath45 symmetry . however , there is experimental evidence @xcite that gottfried integral @xmath46 is less than @xmath47 , which is the value expected in the simple quark model .",
    "thus we should allow @xmath41 to be different from @xmath42 . indeed",
    ", in the valon model we may expect that in a @xmath10 valon the necessary presence of a @xmath25 valence quark would on the grounds of fermi statistics make a gluon have more difficulty converting virtually into a @xmath48 pair than into a @xmath49 pair .",
    "hence , @xmath41 should be suppressed relative to @xmath42 .",
    "since there are two @xmath10 and one @xmath12 is a proton , we should expect the overall @xmath35 to be less than @xmath36 .",
    "the data do indicate @xmath50 after integration over @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we thus see that the breaking of @xmath45 in the sea is related to pauli blocking in the valons .",
    "the valence quark distributions , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are given by cteq4lq @xcite . from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) , and ( [ 2.11 ] ) we see that they are directly related to the valon distributions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , by convolutions with the common factor @xmath53 .",
    "it is therefore possible to isolate the valon distributions by deconvolution using the moments .",
    "let us define @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 and similarly for @xmath57 in terms of @xmath52 . then by the convolution theorem we have from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) , @xmath58 @xmath59 it thus follows that @xmath60 if the valon model is valid , then the lhs is @xmath0 independent , a property that we can check directly by examining the @xmath0 dependence of the rhs . since @xmath61 and @xmath62 can separately be determined from @xcite , we only have to take their moments and calculate their ratio .",
    "to do the above analysis , we have to set the range of @xmath0 to be examined , since the valon model is not expected to be accurate for all @xmath0 . as we have discussed near the end of sec .",
    "i , the valon model has been applied to soft production problems because they involve non - perturbative processes . for hard processes at very high @xmath63",
    "( gev / c)@xmath64 $ ] perturbative qcd is very successful and there is no need to introduce any inaccuracies through the use of a model .",
    "we shall therefore limit ourselves to the range @xmath65(gev / c)@xmath4 .",
    "this is actually a very wide range for hadronic processes that can involve the production of soft particles and semi - hard mini - jets .    for the range of @xmath0 chosen we must use low-@xmath0 parameterization of the pdf s .",
    "cteq4lq @xcite gives the graphs of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath66 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath15 distributions at any @xmath1 evolved from the starting scale at @xmath67  ( gev / c)@xmath4 . since @xmath51 and @xmath52 distributions are not included in the list of pdf s posted , we have to calculate @xmath68 @xmath69 from the @xmath70 and @xmath71 graphs for the rhs available from the web .",
    "we extract the numerical values at up to 60 points of @xmath2 values per pdf for three values of @xmath72 gev / c . from the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 thus determined ,",
    "we then compute the moments in accordance to eq .",

    "it is evident that the dependence is very mild , the maximum deviation from 1 being around 7% at @xmath80 and @xmath81 gev / c .",
    "we regard this approximate constancy of @xmath77 , while @xmath1 is increased by an order of magnitude , as the first step toward a confirmation of the validity of the valon model .",

    "we find @xmath97 @xmath98 we have not ignored the small @xmath1 dependences of @xmath84 and @xmath85 since the data on @xmath74 contain some @xmath1 dependence .",

    "with the drastic difference between figs .  2 and 3 in mind , it is reasonable to conclude that the essence of the valon model has been verified to the extent that the valon distributions exhibit approximate scaling in @xmath1 .",
    "it should be remarked that the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 determined above are very different from the ones obtained previously . in ref .",

    "the modern data of cteq4lq were used , but the values @xmath106 and @xmath107 were obtained due to the assumption of a specific form of the sea quark distribution ( proven to be grossly inaccurate below ) . here in this paper",
    "we have avoided making any assumption about the sea quark distributions . by extracting the valence quark distributions from cteq4lq",
    "we have been able to determine @xmath29 and @xmath30 directly .",

    "we see that the momentum fractions carried by the valons are essentially independent of @xmath1 and that each @xmath10 valon carries as much as 1.345 times more than the @xmath12 valon .",
    "having determined the valon distributions , we can now proceed to the quark and gluon distributions in the valons . from eq .",
