    "more than a decade ago , observations of supernovae type ia led to a surprising discovery @xcite , the universe has entered accelerated expansion recently ; i.e. such observations could match the luminosity distance versus the redshift for a relativistic friedmann - lemare - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe if and only if a dark energy component or a cosmological constant is invoked on the budget of the universe .",
    "later on , this conclusion was corroborated for example by measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , if not properly standard candles , have also been very useful in this regard @xcite . what is this component filling the universe ?",
    "is it a constant of nature ?",
    "is it evolving with time ?",
    "or is it a consequence of quantum gravity ?",
    "we are far from giving an answer to these fundamental questions in this paper .",
    "we will rather follow a phenomenological approach inspired on a positive answer to the third question raised above @xcite , more precisely based on the holographic dark energy scenario @xcite .",
    "several years ago bekenstein proposed a bound on the total entropy of a system of volume @xmath0 ; such a bound is proportional to the area of the system , @xmath1 , rather than its volume @xcite .",
    "indeed , for such a system the number of degrees of freedom would be finite and related to its area according to the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "consequently , a breakdown of the quantum field theory for large volumes would be expected @xcite : for an effective quantum field theory with an ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff , @xmath2 , the entropy of a system would scale as @xmath3 . to circumvent this breakdown , cohen _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a relationship between uv and infrared ( ir ) cutoffs ensuring the validity of an effective quantum field theory within this regime @xcite : @xmath4 the largest scale allowed is the one saturating the previous inequality , for which we can define an energy density @xcite @xmath5 where for convenience the constant @xmath6 has been introduced and @xmath7 .",
    "the holographic dark energy model is based on assuming the energy density @xmath8 is responsible for the current speed up of the universe with @xmath9 being an appropriate cosmological length .",
    "indeed , it was soon realised that by choosing @xmath9 as the inverse of the current hubble rate , @xmath8 is of the order of the current dark energy density @xcite , even though the equation of state would not be the appropriate one as it would not induce acceleration in a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "later on , @xmath9 was chosen to be the event horizon and it turns out that in this case the late - time acceleration of the universe is suitably described @xcite .    an alternative approach to explain the current acceleration of the universe is based on the brane - world scenario @xcite , which is inspired on string theory , a candidate to quantum theory . in this kind of scenario ,",
    "our universe is a brane , i.e. a 4-dimensional ( 4d ) hypersurface , embedded in the bulk ; i.e. the higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the simplest and best studied case is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite .",
    "such a model contains two kinds of solutions @xcite : the self - accelerating branch , which suffers from some problems , and the normal branch . even though the normal branch is _ healthy",
    "_ it can not describe the current acceleration of the universe unless a dark energy component is invoked @xcite or the gravitational action is modified @xcite .",
    "although extra - dimensions have not been detected experimentally , they have a theoretical basis on string theory , which might or might not be the ultimate theory of nature .",
    "we are far to address this issue on the present paper .",
    "brane - world models are a simple arena where to test `` string inspired '' models through cosmology , for example . the induced gravity term ( or a 4d einstein - hilbert term in the classical theory )",
    "is expected to arise on the brane action as a result of the loop - corrections from matter fields @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a gauss - bonnet curvature term is as well expected to arise in the bulk , motivated from string theory and also from a mathematical / physical point of view as it gives raise to equations of motion of second order in the metric .",
    "both effects were first analysed in reference @xcite and latter on in references @xcite , where it was shown that they can be quite useful to describe the current acceleration of the universe , for example they can mimic a phantom like behaviour without phantom matter , and appease some of the singularities that can take place in the universe like the big bang or the big rip . finally , the holographic dark energy is a phenomenological approach to implement the holographic principle in a cosmological setting .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to show that even though an holographic energy density with the hubble rate as the infra - red cutoff is not suitable to describe the late - time acceleration of a 4d relativistic model nor a brane - world model with induced gravity ( on the normal branch ) , it is suitable to describe the late - time acceleration of a brane world - model with an induced gravity term on the brane and a gauss - bonnet effect in the bulk .",
    "an holographic dark energy model within the dgp scenario was analysed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it was shown that the normal branch filled with an holographic energy density with cutoff scale @xmath10 can not explain the current acceleration of the universe . in this paper",
    ", we will show that by invoking a gauss - bonnet term in the bulk the situation can be improved and the brane undergoes a speed up at late - time .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we present the holographic brane - world model we analyse , we impose some constraints on the parameters of the model and deduce the maximally symmetric solutions of the model . in sect .",
    "iii , we analyse the modified friedmann equation of the model . by solving this cubic equation analytically , we are able to obtain the different evolutions the brane can undergo . in sect .",
    "iii , we pick up the most suitable brane to describe the current acceleration .",
    "we present as well a description of the effective dark energy responsible for the late - time acceleration of the brane , in sect .",
    "iv . finally , in sect .",
    "v , we summarise and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a 5-d brane - world model , where the bulk contains a gauss - bonnet curvature term on top of the usual hilbert - einstein action , while the brane contains only an induced gravity term on its action .",
    "then the modified friedmann equation reads @xcite @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to the cross - over scale and the gauss - bonnet parameter , respectively . on the other hand , @xmath14 . for @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "we recover the normal dgp branch while for @xmath17 and @xmath16 we obtain the self - accelerating dgp branch @xcite .",
    "as we are dealing with the late - time acceleration of the universe , the matter content of the brane can be described through a cold dark matter component ( cdm ) with energy density @xmath18 and a dark energy component given by an holographic energy density , @xmath19 , ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as already mentioned in the introduction , @xmath8 is related to the uv cutoff , while @xmath9 is related to the ir cutoff .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 was first identified with the inverse of the hubble rate , even though it was shown later on in @xcite that such a choice could not describe the current acceleration of the universe in a 4-d relativistic model and other proposals were put forward @xcite . from now on we will only consider the brane with @xmath20 because the other branch ( @xmath21 ) is self - accelerating on the absence of any kind of dark energy @xcite .    in this paper , we will show that by considering a brane - world model with an induced gravity term on the brane and a gauss - bonnet term in the bulk , the brane undergoes a consistent acceleration induced by an holographic dark energy with @xmath10 .",
    "notice that this can not take place on the normal dgp branch @xcite .",
    "the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann1 ] ) can be written more conveniently as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the usual convenient dimensionless parameters ( we will follow the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "the energy density of matter is conserved on the brane as we are assuming a maximally symmetric bulk and we have not assumed any sort of interaction between matter and the holographic component on the brane .",
    "we assume that the holographic dark energy stated in equation ( [ rhoholographic ] ) remains valid on brane - world models like the one we have considered here .",
    "a similar approach was followed on @xcite .",
    "our approach is nevertheless consistent with the bianchi identity , which is satisfied , as the total energy density is conserved on the brane ( see eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) ) , more precisely , the matter energy density as well as the effective energy density are conserved ( cf .",
    "( 4.3 ) ) .",
    "in addition , the holographic energy we consider do not violate the null energy condition ( or the dominant energy condition ) because the energy density is proportional to the square of the hubble rate which is a decreasing function ( as a function of time ) for the set of physical solutions we analyse in section iv .",
    "we , therefore , do not have the kind of instabilities present on phantom models .    in absence of matter ,",
    "i.e. @xmath25 , we obtain two kind of maximally symmetric solutions : a flat solution ; i.e. @xmath26 , and two de sitter solutions with dimensionless hubble rates : @xmath27 notice that the de sitter solutions exist if and only if @xmath28 @xcite .    the cosmological parameters of the model are constrained by evaluating the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann2 ] ) at @xmath29 @xmath30 the deceleration parameter , @xmath31 , can be obtained and in particular its present value reads @xmath32 by combining eqs .",
    "( [ constraintom ] ) and ( [ q0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath33 the universe is currently accelerating , therefore @xmath34 . bearing in mind that the current value of @xmath35 is roughly @xmath36 , we conclude that @xmath37 therefore , the parameter @xmath38 must satisfy @xmath39 but still not too large .",
    "this condition will simplify considerably our analysis of the modified friedmann equation ( [ friedmann2 ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to look as well at the raychaudhuri equation which reads @xmath40 where a dot stands for the derivative with respect to the cosmic time of the brane .",
    "as @xmath39 , it turns out that @xmath41 might diverge at the finite dimensionless hubble rates @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for the expression with a minus and a plus in front of the square root , respectively .",
    "the blowing up of @xmath45 may indicate the presence of sudden singularities @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in some extra - dimensional models such a behaviour can show up even for a finite pressure @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that if the dimensionless hubble rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 are reached they take place at the ( dimensionless ) energy densities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , defined in eqs .",

    "in order to continue the analysis of this model we need to solve the cubic friedmann equation ( [ friedmann2 ] ) which we tackle next . concerning this aim ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables : @xmath49 the friedmann equation can be rewritten as follows @xmath50 notice that @xmath51 has to be positive in order for the brane to be accelerating at present , as was shown on the previous section .",
