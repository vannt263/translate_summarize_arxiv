    "the neutrino ( here collectively used in order to denote a mass eigenstate of the neutrino field ) is the only particle in the ( extended ) standard model for which an appropriate first - quantized description has not yet been completely determined , and the observation of nonvanishing neutrino masses has not simplified the task ( for pertinent overview , see refs .",
    "possible candidate equations include ( i )  the dirac equation with a standard , scalar mass term  @xcite , ( ii )  the majorana equation ( which would imply that neutrinos are equal to their own antiparticle , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and ( iii )  generalized dirac equations with a pseudoscalar mass term  @xcite .",
    "the latter equation leads to a manifest helicity dependence of the anti - commutators of the field operators and to a superluminal ( tachyonic ) dispersion relation , which has recently been discussed in ref .",
    "recent claims regarding a possibly superluminal nature of the neutrino , which eventually turned out to be in error , have inspired theorists to revisit theoretical ideas whose relevance extends beyond relevance to the experimental claims .",
    "however , in order to keep things in perspective , we should remember that the origin of these ideas dates back about three decades  @xcite .",
    "finally , ( iv )  further modified dirac equations with small lorentz - breaking terms have also been discussed in the literature  @xcite .    in the current article",
    ", our focus will be on a comparison of the helicity suppression in models  ( i ) and  ( iii ) , while the majorana character of a neutrino  ( ii ) is commonly associated to the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which generates neutrino masses and the mass gap of left - handed and right - handed neutrinos by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it leads to an effective suppression of the right - handed neutrino interaction , in view of a large mass separation of the different helicities .",
    "namely , right - handed neutrinos acquire a mass of order @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the grand unification scale , while left - handed neutrinos acquire a mass of the order of @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the higgs vacuum expectations value . from the point of view of fundamental symmetries , a majorana character of the neutrino , combined with the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "would solve two issues simultaneously .",
    "namely , ( i )  it would explain why the neutrino masses are so small as compared to the masses of other particles in the standard model , and ( ii )  it would offer a very natural interpretation for the elusive helicity reversal of a neutrino overtaken by a speeding vehicle on a highway .",
    "the right - handed state would naturally be interpreted as a right - handed anti - neutrino , i.e. , as a physical state of the neutrino s own ( identical ) anti - particle .    however , the introduction of a majorana neutrino into an extended standard model is not as innocent as it seems .",
    "in particular , the majorana mass term violates lepton number , which is a global symmetry that tracks the difference between particles and antiparticles ( an excellent overview is presented in ref .",
    "while there is nothing sacred about global symmetries , `` lepton number conservationalists '' might find the lack of a proper distinction of particles and antiparticles disturbing .",
    "a majorana neutrino would be the only spin-@xmath5 particle in an ( extended ) standard model which is equal to its own antiparticle ( the original standard model called for a weyl neutrino ) .",
    "furthermore , a majorana neutrino is described by an equation which , on the level of first quantization , does not allow plane - wave solutions of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a spinor ( or polarization vector in the case of spin-@xmath8 particles ) and @xmath9 is the scalar product of energy - momentum and space - time coordinate ( see also  [ appc ] ) .",
    "recent measurements set rather strict bounds for the magnitude of the majorana mass terms  @xcite as inferred from neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .    in order to put things into perspective , we recall that in the `` good old times '' , neutrinos were supposed to be massless weyl fermions which come in only one helicity state .",
    "weyl fermions transform according to the fundamental @xmath10 representation of the lorentz group .",
    "the well - known discovery of neutrino oscillations implies that the neutrinos need to have a nonvanishing mass .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana fermions , then the right - handed states could be interpreted as antineutrinos because majorana fermions are equal to their own antiparticles , but this interpretation is unavailable if neutrinos are dirac fermions .",
    "because of the historical , proverbial association of very high speeds with the `` autobahn '' , we would like to refer to the underlying question as the `` helicity reversal paradox '' or even the `` autobahn helicity paradox '' while stressing that the problem has been raised here before in the scientific literature . other possible designations , inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , would include the `` rabbit paradox '' in light of the fact that high propagating velocities needed to overtake a neutrino are commonly associated with the physical abilities of a species known as the `` lepus '' or `` lepus curpaeums '' ( in latin ) .",
    "indeed , the elusive helicity reversal of a neutrino , overtaken on a highway by speeding vehicle , has given rise to a few questions discussed by goldhaber and goldhaber  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( labelled as `` question  # 76 '' regarding `` neutrino mass and helicity '' in the american journal of physics ) , the author raises the question as to how the helicity flip upon ( hypothetically ) overtaking a left - handed neutrino should be interpreted physically : if only left - helicity neutrino states take part in the weak interaction and helicity is not conserved upon a lorentz boost , then is the theory of the weak interaction self - consistent ?",
    "although this paradox has been around for as long as theorists have conceived of massive neutrinos and has often been discussed and argued in qualitative terms , it is somewhat surprising that we were unable to find a direct quantitative treatment of the relevant physics in the academic literature .",

    "in sec .  [ sec2 ] , we have calculated the helicity flip of a neutrino , overtaken on a highway .",
    "one might think that the same helicity flip might occur in a reference frame which rotates around the propagation direction ( assumed to be the @xmath53 axis ) of the neutrino , imagining that the spin of a particle can be viewed as the rotation of a spinning top .",
    "let us first present an intuitive , classical argument suggesting that a helicity flip can not occur upon transformation to the rotating frame and then supplement this argument by a full quantum calculation , in the spinor formalism .",
    "the classical argument is based on the following observation : imagine the neutrino as a spinning top with a ( classical ) angular momentum component @xmath171 . if the mass of the spinning top is concentrated on a ring displaced by a radius @xmath172 from the central rotation axis , and @xmath167 is the mass of the spinning classical `` neutrino '' , then the angular momentum is @xmath173 , where @xmath1 is the rotation speed of the mass distribution .",
    "the required speed is equal to the speed of light at a radius governed by the equation @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the reduced compton wavelength .",
    "one can not localize a quantum particle better than its compton wavelength , and therefore the quantum - classical analogue of a spinning top makes sense provided we assume that the particle s mass distribution is displaced from the central rotation axis by a distance commensurate with the particle s compton wavelength .",
    "conversely , only an `` outside '' observer could potentially see the neutrino spinning in the opposite direction and reverse its helicity ; if we are `` inside '' the neutrino s compton wavelength then the concept of a classical spinning top becomes meaningless .",
    "equation   teaches us that if we are to overtake the rotating spinning top by spinning around the axis of rotation faster than the neutrino spin does , and revert its helicity , then we have to rotate about the symmetry axis with a velocity faster than the speed of light .",
    "this is impossible for a classical observer starting from rest , according to special relativity and therefore , the classical consideration strongly suggest that helicity reversal in a rotating frame is impossible .",

    "coincidentally , the only particle which is a candidate for superluminality , the neutrino , has been observed in only one helicity ( left - handed ) , while antineutrinos come in right - handed helicity .",
    "this is precisely what our anticommutator relation   predicts , and postulating this anticommutator is the only possibility we found in order to complete the spinor sum in eq .  , where the prefactor @xmath154 is necessary in order to obtain the positive - energy and negative - energy projectors .",
    "no further alterations are necessary for the theory of weak interactions because lorentz invariance is fully conserved . in principle , the numerical value of the tachyonic mass term could be determined using more precise experiments on neutrino flight times or by looking at the end point of the tritium beta decay experiments more accurately .",
    "if we assume that if the neutrino is superluminal , then the neutrino is not equal to its own antiparticle , and neutrinoless double beta decay is forbidden .",
    "while this conclusion somewhat depends on the precise equation proposed for the description of the neutrino , none of the currently proposed equations  @xcite is charge conjugation invariant , so that there are no charge - conjugation - invariant majorana solutions of the tachyonic spin-@xmath18 equations .",
    "we recall that experimental evidence for the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite is disputed , and recent measurements set even stricter bounds for the magnitude of the majorana mass terms ( for an overview see pp .",

    "this is a two - component equation which clearly can not be solved by a plane - wave ansatz because the first term would involve a factor @xmath221 , whereas the second one , which involves the complex conjugate @xmath222 , would go as @xmath223 .",
    "consequently , in the field operator of the majorana particle given in eq .  , the plane - wave spinor wave functions multiplying the creation and annihilation operators in the fourier decomposition are not plane - wave eigenstates of the majorana equation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is stated that the mass eigenstates of the majorana neutrino are not plane waves but are of the form @xmath224 , i.e. , superpositions of left- and right - handed states [ specifically , see eq .",

    "this is permissible if the neutrino is its own antiparticle . in this context",
    ", we also recall that the charge - conjugation invariant solutions of the massless dirac equation , @xmath225 and @xmath226 are not plane waves with a definite four - momentum , but superpositions of plane waves which travel in opposite directions .",
    "charge conjugation invariance holds because of the relation @xmath227 with @xmath109 ( in the standard representation ) .",
    "so , an outgoing majorana neutrino in a scattering process , described by a wave with a definite four - momentum , momentum can not simultaneously be in an energy eigenstate of the majorana equation .",
    "by contrast , all eigenspinors of the dirac equation ( with scalar or pseudo - scalar mass terms ) simultaneously constitute energy and momentum eigenstates of the dirac hamiltonian , in full compatibility with unperturbed electrons , positrons , heavy leptons , photons , heavy gauge bosons , and quarks , which are all described by plane - wave states proportional to @xmath228 .",
