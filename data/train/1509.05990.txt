    "during the years between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , many attempts were done to enter gravity into special relativity .",
    "einstein , himself , and nordstrom were pioneers in this issue .",
    "nordstrom presented a scalar theory of gravitation @xcite while einstein proposed a tensorial theory of gravitation ein .",
    "eventually , the einstein tensorial theory of gravitation , known today as general relativity ( gr ) , was more successful to pass observational tests and became the standard theory of gravitation @xcite . however , some time later , gr showed some failures .",
    "the most important failure was the inability to describe accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "in addition to latter failure , the fact that mach s principle is not respected by gr led physicists to modify einstein theory of gravity .",
    "one of the most impressive and physically viable modifications is brans - dicke ( bd ) theory adding a scalar degree of freedom to previous 10 degrees of freedom coming from metric tensor @xmath2 in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this theory was motivated from one side by mach s principle encoded by varying gravitational constant in it and from other side by dirac s large number hypothesis .",
    "these two motivations are summed up in this theory by considering a scalar field , @xmath3 , which is inversely proportional to the gravitational constant @xmath4 and nonminimally coupled to gravitation brans1 .",
    "another important aspect of bd theory is its equivalence to several other modifications of gr in particular @xmath5 theories that causes better understating of these theories @xcite .",
    "also , bd theory may be considered as a special case of more general scalar - tensor gravity which has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the first solutions of bd theory have been published by brans himself .",
    "these solutions were in four dimensions and classified in four classes brans2 . among these four classes just two of them",
    "are really independent @xcite while just one of these two independent classes are valid for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "also , linearly charged solutions of bd gravity have been presented in @xcite .",
    "these latter solutions are just allowed in the presence of a trivial ( constant ) scalar field in four dimensions .",
    "this is due to the conformal invariance of linear maxwell lagrangian in four dimensions .",
    "since linear maxwell lagrangian is no longer conformally invariant in higher dimensions , the linear maxwell field can play the role of source of scalar field for higher - dimensional bd gravity @xcite .",
    "the highly nonlinear nature of bd theory makes it non - straightforward in many cases to find the solutions by solving bd field equations directly .",
    "fortunately , there is a way to overcome this problem .",
    "as it has been shown in many cases , the solutions of bd theory can be found by applying a conformal transformation on known solutions of other theories such as dilaton theory @xcite .",
    "for instance , linearly charged rotating black branes have been obtained in bd theory by applying a conformal transformation from the known solutions of dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "also , by using a similar method , asymptotic anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes and topological black holes with nonflat and non - ads asymptotic behaviors have been investigated in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the fact that one can transform the lagrangian of bd gravity to the lagrangian of dilaton gravity by a conformal transformation has been also used for more general scalar - tensor gravities in @xciteto investigate the different aspects of scalar - tensor gravities in the presence of nonlinear electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear electrodynamics was first introduced by born and infeld in order to obtain the finite energy density for an electron @xcite . in recent years other types of born - infeld like nonlinear electrodynamics",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the studies were also extended to dilaton gravity @xcite . however , the energy - momentum tensors of born - infeld theory or the born - infeld like theories are not traceless even in four dimensions . a nonlinear electrodynamic theory with a traceless energy - momentum tensor in higher dimensions has been introduced in plm1 . the power - law maxwell matter source is conformal invariant in higher dimensions for special choice of power . to be more clear , the lagrangian of power - law maxwell field @xmath7 is invariant under conformal transformation @xmath8 , @xmath9 provided @xmath10 . despite of the mentioned special property for @xmath10 ,",
    "many solutions have been studied from different aspects with nonfixed @xmath11 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the study of @xcite to nonlinear power - law maxwell field electrodynamics and try to solve field equations of bd theory by using known solutions of dilaton gravity that we have recently presented in @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the basic field equations of bd theory with power - law maxwell lagrangian .",
    "we also introduce a conformal transformation which transforms this theory to einstein - dilaton gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sol ] , we obtain a class of topological black hole solution of this theory and investigate its properties . in sec .",
    "[ ther ] , we investigate thermodynamics of the solutions and check the validity of the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we finish our paper with closing remarks in the last section .",
    "the action of brans - dicke theory coupled to a power - law maxwell ( bdpm ) field can be written as@xmath12where @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the coupling constant , @xmath3 denotes the bd scalar field , @xmath11 is a constant determining the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field and @xmath14 is a self - interacting potential for @xmath3 . in eq .",
    "( [ act ] ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16}$ ] is the electromagnetic tensor field and @xmath17 is the vector potential .",

    "this fact makes the problem of solving the field equations ( [ fil1])-([fil3 ] ) difficult .",
    "fortunately , this difficulty can be circumvented by using the following conformal transformation : @xmath19where @xmath20 is the dilaton field and @xmath21indeed , the transformation ( [ conf ] ) transforms the action ( [ act ] ) to the action of einstein - dilaton gravity coupled to power - law maxwell field @xcite @xmath22where @xmath23 .",
    "one may note that @xmath24 is a constant which determines the strength of coupling of the scalar and electromagnetic field and is equal to zero for @xmath10 .",
    "so , we assume that @xmath25 .",
    "the field equations corresponding to action ( [ act2 ] ) are @xmath26@xmath27one should note that the field equation ( [ fe1 ] ) does not contain second order derivatives of scalar field and , therefore , one can solve eqs .",
    "( fe1)-([fe2 ] ) in a simpler way than the field equations ( [ fil1])-([fil3 ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the solution of einstein - dilaton - power maxwell ( edpm ) gravity has been presented .",
    "we first review these solutions in the next section .",
    "in order to obtain the topological black hole solutions of bdpm gravity , we first review the @xmath28-dimensional topological black hole solutions of edpm gravity ( [ act2 ] ) presented in @xcite .",
    "the metric of a general static spacetime can be written as @xmath29where @xmath30 is the metric of an @xmath31-dimensional constant curvature hypersurface .",
    "the curvature of this hypersurface is equal to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that in order to have topological black holes with a general @xmath34 and @xmath11 , the potential should be chosen as    @xmath35    where@xmath36 the solutions of edpm field equations are @xcite    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41@xmath42 is an arbitrary nonzero positive constant , and @xmath43 . in the above relations @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two constants proportional to the mass and charge of the black holes , respectively , and @xmath46 is a free constant which can be interpreted as cosmological constant , since in the absence of the dilaton field @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 .",
    "thus as usual , we redefine it as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant with length dimension .    with the solutions of edpm gravity in hand",
    ", we can construct @xmath28-dimensional solutions of bdpm by applying conformal transformation ( conf ) .",
    "the line element of the spacetime can be obtained as@xmath51where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 . the electromagnetic gauge potential @xmath60 and potential of scalar field",
    "can also be obtained as    @xmath61    @xmath62    where@xmath63it is worth mentioning that for the case of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , both @xmath66 and @xmath67 vanish and therefore @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "also , one may note that as @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) for the linear maxwell theory ( @xmath64 ) , solutions ( [ u(r ) ] ) and ( [ v(r ) ] ) reduce to@xmath72which describes an @xmath28-dimensional asymptotically ( a)ds topological black hole for positive ( negative ) cosmological constant with a flat ( @xmath65 ) , spherical ( @xmath73 ) or hyperbolic ( @xmath74 ) horizons ( see for example bril1,cai3,lemos ) .",
    "for @xmath64 , our solutions reproduce the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one should note that there are some constraints on the values of @xmath11 and @xmath75 .",
    "we stress on this fact that the electromagnetic gauge potential @xmath76 should vanish at infinity and , therefore , @xmath77 which leads to    @xmath78    on the other hand , we assume that the scalar field of bd be a localized function . that is @xmath3 should go to zero as @xmath79 which implies @xmath80 and therefore    @xmath81    one can summarize ( [ res1 ] ) and ( [ res2 ] ) to receive    @xmath82    which is the allowed range of @xmath11 . in the above allowed range of @xmath11 the charge term of the metric functions",
    "@xmath52 given in eq .",
    "( [ u(r ) ] ) dominates in the vicinity of @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , it is sufficient to check the sign of the power of @xmath84 in the mass term in @xmath52 in order to guarantee that the effects of mass and charge vanish at infinity in both @xmath85 and @xmath53 given by ( [ u(r ) ] ) and ( [ v(r ) ] ) [ note that according to ( [ res3 ] ) , @xmath80 ] .",
    "one can easily show that the effects of mass in @xmath52 disappear at infinity provided    @xmath87    or equivalently @xmath88hence the allowed ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath24 or @xmath6 are @xmath89or equivalently@xmath90 before discussing the properties of our solutions , we pause to consider the stability of the system . in order to have a stable system ,",
    "it is necessary for @xmath14 to have a lower bound . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath14 is bounded from below for suitable choices of the parameters .",
    "now , we are ready to discuss physical properties of the topological bd black holes in the presence of power - law maxwell field .",
    "first , we discuss the domain of validity of our solutions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ u(r ) ] ) and ( [ v(r ) ] ) , our solutions are ill defined for the string case where @xmath91 [ corresponding to the case of @xmath92/4p^{2}(n-1)$ ] ] , except for the flat horizon case i.e. @xmath65 . for other values of @xmath24 ,",
    "our solutions are well defined in the permitted ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath24 .",
    "second , it is easy to show that there is an essential singularity at @xmath83 since the kretschmann scalar @xmath93 diverges at @xmath83 .",
    "kretschmann scalar also is finite for @xmath94 and vanishes as @xmath95 third , the charge term in both @xmath53 and @xmath52 is the dominant term in the vicinity of @xmath83 and goes to infinity for the allowed ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath24 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus , the singularity is timelike as in the case of reissner - nordstrom black holes .",
    "that is , there is no schwarzschild - like solution and one encounters with the solutions with two inner and outer horizons , extreme black holes and naked singularities depending on the values of the metric parameters such as @xmath11 , @xmath97 , @xmath44 , @xmath24 and @xmath34 .",
    "fourth , we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions . in order to consider the asymptotic behavior of our solutions , it is enough to investigate the behavior of the metric function @xmath98 at infinity . in the case of @xmath65 , for @xmath99 $ ] [ note that @xmath100 implies that @xmath101 and @xmath102 is ( [ res4 ] ) ]",
    ", the metric functions go to infinity as @xmath84 goes to infinity provided @xmath103 , and one has cosmological horizon for @xmath104 . in the case of @xmath105 , for @xmath106 , the first term of @xmath53",
    "is the dominant term at infinity .",

    "finally , we investigate the causal structure of our solutions . in order to do this , and find out whether the singularity is naked or not , we should study the zeros of @xmath111 .",
    "although it is difficult to find the roots of @xmath112 analytically , we can gain some insight into the behavior of it by studying @xmath113:@xmath114    which comes from this fact that @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the radius of the horizon .",
    "we consider @xmath113 in the absence of the cosmological horizon and with cosmological horizon , separately . in the absence of cosmological horizon ,",

[ fig4]-[fig7 ] ) . for solutions with cosmological horizon ,",
    "the function @xmath113 starts from infinity and goes to minus infinity as @xmath116 increases from zero to infinity . in this case",

    "[ fig8 ] shows .",
    "when @xmath130 has zeros , the function @xmath113 starts at infinity and goes to minus infinity with a minimum and a maximum as one can see in fig . [ fig9 ] . in this case",
    "we have black holes with three inner , outer and cosmological horizons provided @xmath131 an extreme black hole with cosmological horizon if @xmath132 and a naked singularity with cosmological horizon for the cases @xmath133 and @xmath134  as one may see in fig .",

    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , we have cosmological horizon for @xmath103 .",
    "this result is interesting since it shows that we can have cosmological horizon in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "in this section , we are going to check the validity of the first law of thermodynamics for the topological bd black holes with power - law maxwell field . in order to do this",
    ", we should calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we start with temperature .",
    "the hawking temperature of the topological black holes on the outer horizon @xmath120 can be calculated using the relation @xmath135where @xmath136 is the surface gravity .",
    "one obtains    @xmath137    comparing the temperature ( [ temp ] ) with one calculated in the case of edpm gravity @xcite , one finds that temperature is invariant under the conformal transformation ( [ conf ] ) .",
    "this comes from the fact that the conformal parameter at the horizon is regular .",
    "the charge of the black hole can be calculated through the modified gauss law , @xmath138where @xmath139  and @xmath140  are the unit spacelike and timelike normals to a sphere of radius @xmath84  given as @xmath141therefore the charge can be computed as @xmath142where @xmath143  denotes the volume of constant curvature hypersurface @xmath144 .",
    "in addition to temperature and charge we need to calculate mass , entropy and electric potential in order to check the satisfaction of the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we can obtain the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath145 , entropy @xmath146  and electric potential @xmath147  of the topological black holes by using the euclidean action method caisu . in this method",
    ", one should first fix the electric potential and the temperature on the boundary with a fixed radius @xmath120 . then , in order to make the metric positive definite , @xmath148 should be substituted by @xmath149 : @xmath150this is a necessary step to make the euclidean action .",
    "since one encounters a conical singularity at the horizon @xmath151  in the euclidean metric caisu , the euclidean time @xmath152  is made periodic with period @xmath153 , where @xmath153  is the inverse of hawking temperature in order to eliminate this singularity .",
    "now , we are ready to obtain the euclidean action of @xmath28-dimensional bdpm black hole .",
    "the euclidean action has two parts namely bulk and surface .",
    "the euclidean action can be calculated analytically and continuously changing of the action ( [ act ] ) to the euclidean time @xmath152 , i.e.,@xmath154where @xmath155  is the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary metric @xmath156 when @xmath157  and @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath155 is added in order to normalize the euclidean action to zero in background @xcite . using the metric ( eumetr ) , one can obtain@xmath159 ,   \\label{re } \\\\ k & = & -\\frac{\\sqrt{v}\\left [ rhu^{\\prime } + 2(n-1)\\left ( uh+ruh^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right ] } { 2rhu } ,   \\label{k}\\end{aligned}\\]]inserting @xmath52  and @xmath53  from ( [ u(r ) ] ) and ( [ v(r ) ] ) with @xmath157and @xmath158  in @xmath160 , one obtains    @xmath161{r}^{2\\gamma } { b}^{-2\\gamma } \\right\\ }    \\notag \\\\ & & { r}^{-1}\\left ( n-4p+1\\right ) ^{-1}[2{b}^{2\\gamma } \\lambda \\,\\left ( \\alpha ^{2}-1\\right ) \\left ( { \\alpha } ^{2}+n-2\\right ) \\,{r}^{2(1-\\gamma ) } + { r}% ^{2\\gamma } { b}^{-2\\gamma } k\\left ( n-1\\right ) \\left ( n-2\\right ) \\left ( n-{% \\alpha } ^{2}\\right ) ] ^{-1 }   \\label{k0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting @xmath162 and @xmath155 give by eqs .",

    "one can easily compare eq .",
    "( [ ie ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ gd ] ) and find that@xmath166@xmath167@xmath168here , it is worthwhile to give some remarks . first , it is notable that the quantities obtained in this section , either conserved or thermodynamic ones , coincide with those calculated in @xcite .",
    "this fact shows that these quantities are invariant under the conformal transformation ( [ conf]).it is also worth to note that although entropy is invariant under conformal transformations , it does not follow the area law @xcite in contrast with the case of dilaton black holes in the presence of power - law maxwell field @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the euclidean action formalism the entropy comes from the boundary term .",
    "now , we turn back to the main purpose of this section which is seeking for satisfaction of first law of thermodynamics for topological bd black holes .",
    "it is a matter of calculations to check that the conserved and thermodynamic quantities calculated in this section satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics@xmath169it is also worth mentioning that since the thermodynamic quantities of our topological solutions in bdpm gravity coincide with the ones in edpm gravity , thermal stability discussions are the same .",
    "the stability of the topological black hole under thermal perturbations in edpm gravity has been discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we constructed a new class of topological black hole solutions of bd theory in the presence of a power - law maxwell field with the lagrangian .",
    "for this purpose , we introduced the conformal transformation ( [ conf ] ) that transforms the edpm lagrangian to the bdpm one .",
    "then , by using this conformal transformation , we obtained bd solutions from einstein - dilaton solutions presented in @xcite .",
    "this fact that the bd scalar field is a localized function accompanied with the fact that the effects of mass and charge should disappear at infinity restrict the allowed ranges of the power of electromagnetic source lagrangian , @xmath11 , and the bd coupling constant , @xmath6 .",

    "our bd solutions are always well defined , except for @xmath172 in the cases of spherical ( @xmath73 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath74 ) horizons .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in the above ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath6 , the charge term is always dominant in the vicinity of @xmath83 and positive in metric functions and , therefore , there are no schwarzschild - like solutions .",
    "next , we studied the conditions under which we have black holes with and without cosmological horizon .",
    "interestingly enough , we showed that our solutions have cosmological horizon even in the presence of negative cosmological constant .    in order to check the satisfaction of the first law of black holes thermodynamics , we first computed temperature and charge",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a new class of higher - dimensional exact topological black hole solutions of the brans - dicke theory in the presence of a power - law maxwell field as the matter source . for this aim </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a conformal transformation which transforms the einstein - dilaton - power - law maxwell gravity lagrangian to the brans - dicke - power - law maxwell theory one . </S>",
    "<S> then , by using this conformal transformation , we obtain the desired solutions . </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the properties of the solutions and conditions under which we have black holes . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , we show that there is a cosmological horizon in the presence of a negative cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate the temperature and charge and then by calculating the euclidean action , we obtain the mass , the entropy and the electromagnetic potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the entropy does not respect the area law , and also the conserved and thermodynamic quantities are invariant under conformal transformation . </S>",
    "<S> using these thermodynamic and conserved quantities , we show that the first law of black hole thermodynamics is satisfied on the horizon . </S>"
