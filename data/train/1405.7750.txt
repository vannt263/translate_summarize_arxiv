    "it can be predicted that the skyrmion lattice should display sophisticated transmission spectra due to its rich fourier components of the spin vortex in space .",
    "little in literature addressed the quantum pumping properties featured by diffraction .",
    "the topic interests us a lot .",
    "so in this work , we consider the spin pumping properties in normal - metal / multiferroic - helimagnet / ferromagnet heterostructures and investigate the physical properties induced by diffracted transmission or what can be coined as spatial nonadiabaticity and the approach can be extended to the skyrmion - lattice - based heterostructures .",

    "these observations give rise to the pumping properties driven by cyclic modulation of @xmath59 , which is shown in fig .",
    "two prominent properties highlight the pumping physics in the nm / mf / fm heterostructure .",
    "the first is the non - vanishing pumped charge current .",
    "it is well known that in fm based tunnel junctions , nonzero spin current with zero charge current can be generated by cyclic magnetization precession . in the latter structure , spatial uniformity gives rise to exactly the same charge scattering matrix for different magnetization azimuthal angles . and",
    "transmission difference in the spin space accumulates during precession .",
    "however the spatial symmetry is broken by the helimagnet spiral .",
    "non - zero spin as well as non - zero charge current is driven out by ferromagnet precession .",
    "the other prominent property is gauge dependence of the pumped charge and spin currents .",
    "the considered situation is special in two points .",
    "the first is spatial nonuniformity . as a result ,",
    "spin - dependent diffraction occurs . and also the diffraction effect can not be averaged out by the cyclic integral of @xmath59 .",
    "the second one is that the time - dependent parameter @xmath59 is physically the precession angle and nonphysically the gauge factor simultaneously .",
    "the two roles play independently .",
    "this point makes distinct demonstration at the two poles of the precession sphere .",
    "4 shows the pumped charge and spin current using the eigenspinors of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and fig .",
    "5 shows its order expansion of one incident electron beam .",
    "it can be seen that the pumped current does not vanish at the two poles of the precession sphere .",
    "we have calculated the transmission spectrum at the two poles and find that all of the three orders of the transmission probabilities do not vary with the magnetization azimuthal angle @xmath59 at the two poles and and the nonzero pumped current is a pure result of the phase of the transmission , the latter of which is not unusual in quantum pumps .",
    "also we replace the mf helimagnet layer by a plane delta barrier and reobtained the magnetization - precession - driven pumped spin current of the fm tunnel junction and it vanishes at the two poles of the precession sphere . from fig .",
    "5 it can be seen that the nonzero pumped current at the two poles is a pure effect of diffraction with the zero - order pumped vanishing at the two poles .    although the numerical results and analysis given above seem self - consistent , it is nonphysical .",
    "precession at zero precession angle makes no sense and to say the least the area of the cyclic loop vanishes .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is the eigenspinor obtained by frame rotation .",
    "it should have the same gauge phase as the eigenspinor ( [ eq3 ] ) of @xmath57 .",
    "however , if we make @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , it could not return to eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath59 is a pure gauge phase but over the cyclic loop integral its effect accumulates instead of cancelling out giving rise to nonvanishing pumped current at zero @xmath95 .",
    "the problem could be solved by the gauge transformation eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) with @xmath96 numerical results of the pumped current in this gauge are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the pumped current vanishes at the @xmath94 pole .",
    "it does not vanish at the @xmath97 pole since the gauge of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) also could not return to the eigenspinors of @xmath98 , which are the swap of the two spinors of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . also under gauge transformation eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) with @xmath99 the pumped current vanishes at the @xmath100 pole and is nonzero at the @xmath101 pole , which is not shown in the manuscript to avoid tediousness . in consideration of the pumping properties , gauges ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are equivalent only when @xmath102 . in the two cases the relation is not satisfied .",
    "the gauge selection in eigenspinors seldom matters .",
    "but it really does sometimes .",
    "therefore the numerical results raised a question in the considered situation : which gauge is appropriate and why ?",
    "we would like to argue that the question is nontrivial in at least two aspects .",
    "the first is that gauge difference in the pumped current only occurs in the contribution from diffracted orders .",
    "we show the order expansion of the pumped current of gauge eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the zero order contribution of the pumped current is both qualitatively and quantitatively identical to that of the rotation - frame gauge in fig .",
    "obtained numerical results of other gauges show the same properties .",
    "this is probably the reason why the gauge difference is not encountered in spatially uniform quantum pumps without diffraction .",
    "the second is that physically sound results at the two poles of the precession sphere can only be achieved by two un - equivalent gauges .",
    "usually in situations when the intrinsic phase of eigenspinors matters frame rotation gauge of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is thought to secure correctness .",
    "however here it leads to nonphysical results at the two poles . from figs . 4 to 7",
    ", it can be seen that diffraction induced gauge dependence of the pumped current is spectacular , which could not be explained by existed theory to our knowledge .",
    "in this work , we considered the adiabatically pumped charge and spin current driven by precessing ferromagnet in the nm / mf - helimagnet / fm heterostructure . in this structure ,",
    "space modulation of the helimagnet spin spiral gives rise to diffraction in the transmission spectrum .",
    "it is found that the usually neglected gauge difference in the ferromagnet eigenspinor can not be overlooked trivially .",
    "usually ubiquitous gauge phase obtained by frame rotation of the @xmath32 eigenspinors gives non - vanishing pumped current at the two poles of the precessing sphere , which makes no sense .",
    "we numerically confirmed the unitarity of the scattering matrix of the combined zero and @xmath82 order diffracted states , which justifies the three order cutoff .",
    "we also show that the gauge dependence is a pure effect of diffraction with the zero order contribution gauge independent . by selecting two distinctive gauges at the two poles ,",
    "physically sound vanishing pumped current can be obtained separately .",
    "these results raised the unsettled question of a self - consistent gauge definition in the considered situation .",
