    "in recent years the study of open quantum systems has been the interest of many researchers @xcite , due to the fact that in realistic situations the system is rarely isolated and usually affected by the environment . based on the memory effects and information flow between the system and the environment ,",
    "the reduced open system dynamical processes are divided into two categories , namely , markovian and non - markovian dynamical maps .",
    "the markovian dynamics of the system assumes weak system - environment interaction , short environment correlation time and as a result  memory - less \" information flows between the system and the environment .",
    "it is mathematically described by completely positive semigroup maps , or by the solution of a master equation of the lindblad type @xcite .",
    "but in practice the strong coupling between system and environment generally leads to non - markovian dynamics , where the manifestation of memory effects develops the back - flow of information from the environment to the system @xcite and causes the breakdown of the semi - group property @xcite .",
    "thus markovian maps are not always proper approximation of the underlying dynamics when dealing with many essential properties of open quantum systems , while memory effects and non - markovianity have been shown to be a resource for quantum technologies .",
    "for example , effects of non - markovianity has been investigated for quantum metrology @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , many - body physics @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement generation @xcite , optimal control @xcite , quantum biology @xcite , and channel capacity @xcite .",
    "interestingly the concept of markovian and non - markovian dynamics in the classical regime is properly defined and widely studied @xcite , but its quantum versions are somewhat ambiguous , subtle and often controversial in some sense .",
    "thus various criteria have been proposed in recent literature to quantitatively characterize non - markovian dynamics based on different considerations such as semigroup property , divisibility , or back - flow of information from the environment to the system etc .",
    "based on the breakdown of semigroup property of the dynamical maps , wolf _",
    "proposed a measure for non - markovianity in terms of the deviation of the logarithm of dynamical maps from the canonical lindblad generators @xcite .",
    "quantified non - markovianity as the degree of deviation from divisibility of dynamical maps , which is commonly known as rhp measure @xcite .",
    "defined a measure , known as blp measure , in terms of the non - monotonic behavior of distinguishability between different evolving states , which is associated with the back - flow of information from the environment to the system @xcite .",
    "also a number of non - markovianity measures and witnesses have been proposed based on the non - monotonic behavior of some quantum information measures , due to nondivisibility of the completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) maps in non - markovian dynamics .",
    "for example , there have been significant attempts to quantify non - markovianity using entanglement @xcite , quantum mutual information @xcite , the flow of quantum fisher information @xcite , fidelity between dynamical time - evolved states @xcite , accessible information @xcite , local quantum uncertainty @xcite , quantum interferometric power @xcite , and total entropy production @xcite . in most of these cases ,",
    "computation of non - markovianity measures requires an extra ancilla along with the system , and is complicated to calculate due to optimization problems . also though different non - markovianity measures have been defined based the non - monotonicity due to nondivisibility of cptp maps , they are in general incompatible with each other @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a method to characterize the non - markovianity of an _ incoherent _ open system dynamics ( iosd ) through the non - monotonic behavior of quantum coherence ( qc ) measures .",
    "qc is one of the foremost feature of quantum mechanics that differentiates quantum world from the classical one @xcite .",
    "it posses a wide - ranging impact on quantum optics @xcite , quantum information @xcite , solid state physics @xcite , and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently a set of physical requirements has been formulated which should be satisfied by any valid measure of qc @xcite .",
    "we show that any non - monotonicity in the dynamics of a valid qc measure under an iosd , will act as a witness of non - markovianity . in this formalism",
    "no ancilla is needed to quantify the non - markovian dynamics and the given measure is easy to compute even for complicated dynamics , thus making it experimentally easily tractable .",
    "we also show that this formalism is compatible with distinguishability criteria for various open system dynamics , and captures the back - flow of information from environment to the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section   [ qcoherence ]",
    "we briefly discuss the theory of qc from resource theory perspective and the measures of qc used in this study .",
    "in section   [ markov_coh ] we point out sufficient conditions for an open system dynamical map to be an iosd and introduce a non - markovianity measure based on the non - monotonic evolution of qc measures under an iosd .",
    "section   [ example ] deals with the non - markovianity present in depashing and dissipative channels for one and two qubit systems and show that the non - markovianity measure derived using qc measure is qualitatively consistent with measures based on different criteria , such as distinguishabilty , divisibility , quantum mutual information , quantum interferometric power etc .",
    "finally in section  [ conclude ] we summarize with concluding remarks .",
    "quantum coherence ( qc ) is the direct consequence of quantum mechanical superposition principle and enables a quantum system to show quantum interference phenomena . it is usually described by the existence of the off - diagonal elements of a density matrix with respect to a chosen basis , @xmath0 of the @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "all the density matrices that are diagonal in that basis , are _ incoherent _ states , thus creating the set of incoherent quantum states @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "hence , all density matrices of the from @xmath4 are incoherent , and any state which can not be written in this form is _ coherent _ @xcite .",
    "states @xmath5 of the form @xmath6 have maximal qc , where all @xmath7 .    as quantum entanglement resource theory requires the definition of non - entangling operations ( locc ) @xcite , the notion of incoherent operations naturally comes into the picture of quantum coherence resource theory . by definition , an incoherent operation ( say , @xmath8 )",
    "is a completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) map , which always maps any incoherent state to another incoherent one , i.e. , for any @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite . well known channels such as , phase - flip ( pf ) , bit - flip ( bf ) , bit - phase - flip ( bpf ) , depolarising , phase damping and amplitude damping channels @xcite , which are important for decoherence mechanisms in single qubit systems , are examples of such operations in regular computational basis @xmath11 .",
    "recently , baumgratz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on the two classes of incoherent quantum operations , have formulated a set of physical requirements which should be satisfied by any valid measure of quantum coherence @xmath12 :    * @xmath13 , whenever @xmath9 ; * monotonicity under incoherent completely positive and trace preserving ( icptp ) maps ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 ; * monotonicity under selective measurements on average , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for any set of kraus operators @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 and @xmath21 for each @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath32 are both valid measures of qc . in this paper , we have have concentrated on the @xmath31-norm of coherence for demonstration purpose , while any proper qc measure is expected to show similar results .",
    "in this section , we will first set conditions for open - system dynamical maps for being an iosd and then will try to witness the non - markovian feature present in such iosd s using qc measures .",
    "for this purpose , let us first consider the class of open - system dynamical evolution given by the time - local master equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the liouvillian superoperator @xcite given by @xmath35 + \\sum_k \\gamma_k(t ) \\ [ a_k(t ) \\rho(t ) a_k^{\\dagger}(t ) \\nonumber   \\\\ & - &   \\frac{1}{2 } \\",

    "this helps us to deduce the sufficient conditions that the evolution given in eqs.([dyn1 ] ) and ( [ dyn2 ] ) will be incoherent :    * @xmath36 is diagonal in the preferred basis . *",
    "@xmath40 for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath37 can have at most one non - zero element in each column in that basis .",
    "if we use kraus operator formalism instead of master equations to define a open - system dynamics like @xmath43 , then the kraus operators @xmath19 need to satisfy a sufficient condition like * d.2 . * ,",
    "i.e. , they can have at most one non - zero element in each column in the chosen basis , to describe an incoherent operation .",

    "conversely , if at any instance @xmath51 becomes negative , then the master equation given in eqs.([dyn1 ] ) and ( [ dyn2 ] ) will describe a non - markovian dynamics .",
    "cp - nondivisibility of non - markovian dynamics and monotonic behavior of qc measures under icptp maps can be used to detect and quantify the non - markovianity of an iosd ( @xmath8 ) .",
