    "blazars are one type of active galactic nuclei which are powered by accretion onto a central engine , and have been detected throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to tev gamma rays  @xcite .",
    "blazars show strong variability on many different time scales throughout the electromagnetic spectrum and exhibit a high degree of polarization .",
    "their radio jets exhibit apparent super - luminal motion indicating that they are emitted at small angles to our line of sight .",
    "the central engine is believed to consist of a super - massive black hole ( @xmath2 ) or a binary black hole  @xcite .",
    "there are more than 500 confirmed blazars and their mean redshift is about 0.2  @xcite .    in many respects blazars are similar to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and",
    "there have been many searches for gravitational waves from grbs  @xcite .",
    "both grbs and blazars have a central engine and a jet , both undergo accretion , and both show evidence for non - thermal emission  @xcite . the main difference between them",
    "is the nature of the central engine , and that grbs emit outbursts only once , whereas blazars emit outbursts more than once .",
    "spatial correlations have been observed between blazars and ultra high energy cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "there have been searches for high energy neutrinos associated with blazar flares  @xcite .",
    "the benefits of coincidence searches between the data from neutrino detectors and gravitational wave detectors are outlined in  @xcite .",
    "this also motivates the search for gravitational waves in coincidence with blazar flares .    in this paper",
    "we present a method for searching for gravitational waves associated with an energetic outburst from pks 2155 - 304 blazar , which happened during the fifth ligo science run ( s5 )  @xcite . assuming that the velocity of gravitational waves is same as that of light",
    ", any possible gravitational wave signals should be seen simultaneously along with the electromagnetic outburst .",
    "therefore , this search needs to be done by analyzing the data from gravitational wave detectors at the time of this flare .    to do this search",
    ", we shall combine the data from many gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the search will be done with a coherent network analysis algorithm called ridge  @xcite .",
    "sensitivity results using simulated noise and one set of simulated signals are presented .",
    "we also briefly discuss the outbursts seen from oj 287 and s5 0716 + 71 , which are two other blazars we plan to search for gravitational waves .",
    "since the flare from pks 2155 - 304 lasted several hours , the search for gravitational wave signals from this object has features that are quite distinct from previous ligo searches for gravitational waves associated with grbs . for this search ,",
    "we need to analyze a much longer data segment , during which the source moves significantly on the sky .",
    "this is different from searches for gravitational waves from grbs , where the on - source time interval for which data is analyzed for possible gravitational wave signals is only 180 seconds  @xcite . for this search ,",
    "the corresponding change in the detector responses due to the changing antenna pattern functions must be taken into account .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 is a blazar located in the southern galactic hemisphere with redshift of about 0.12 , which corresponds to a luminosity distance of about 540 mpc  @xcite , and has been observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the nature of the central engine in pks 2155 - 304 is currently unknown .",
    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s )  @xcite detector has been monitoring pks 2155 - 304 since 2002 .",
    "it detected an energetic outburst from pks 2155 - 304  @xcite above 200 gev , which lasted about 2000 seconds , starting from mjd = 53944 ( corresponding to july 28 2006 00:40:00 utc ) .",
    "the total flux during this flare increased by a factor of ten with respect to the quiescent level .",
    "the integrated flux during this flare is @xmath3 .",
    "the total isotropic equivalent energy emitted during this flare assuming the source has a redshift of about 0.12 , matter density of 0.3 , density of cosmological constant of 0.7 , is approximately @xmath0 ergs .",
    "various models have been proposed for this outburst  @xcite , but none of them could satisfactorily explain this large flare along with the steady state emission from this object .",
    "the common feature of all the models used to explain the flare is that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is around 50 , size of the emitting region is around @xmath4 cm , and the jet opening angle is about @xmath5 , which reduces the isotropic equivalent energy emitted by a factor of about @xmath6  @xcite .    during this outburst from pks 2155 - 304 ,",
    "both the 4  km ( h1 ) and 2  km ( h2 ) ligo hanford interferometers and the geo detector were operational .",
    "the third ligo detector in livingston , la was not taking data at this time .",
    "the angular sensitivities to unpolarized gravitational waves of h1 , h2 , and geo within a one day interval from the start of this flare , are shown in figure  [ antresp ] .",
    "the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers can be characterized by its _",
    "inspiral range _",
    "@xcite , defined as the distance to which signals from the inspiral of two @xmath7 neutron stars is detected with signal - to - noise ratio greater than 8 , after averaging over all sky positions and orientations of the binary system .",
    "the corresponding inspiral range for h1 , h2 , and geo detectors were 13 mpc , 7 mpc and 1.3 mpc respectively during this time .",
    "this is at least 50 times smaller than the distance to pks 2155 - 304 .    ) of the ligo hanford detectors and geo detector in a 24 hour interval starting from the pks 2155 - 304 flare , which corresponds to gps time ( @xmath8 ) equal to 838082414 .",
    "the hatched region shows the duration of the flare , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "there are no theoretically accepted gravitational wave emission mechanisms from such transient blazar outbursts in the ligo frequency band .",
    "there have been some proposed mechanisms for steady state gravitational wave emission from active galactic nuclei with super - massive black holes as the central engine in the lisa frequency band , which we briefly describe here .",
    "we should point out that the distance to this object is much greater than the inspiral range of the ligo and geo detectors ( section  [ sec : pks ] ) at this time , and a large amount of gravitational wave energy must be emitted if the expected signal is near the sensitivity of initial ligo . ultimately , since the cause of this flare is unknown , we would like to be open to all possibilities and look for gravitational waves during this outburst without any theoretical prejudice .",
    "one mechanism is through the fragmentation of the accretion disk due to feedback energy from star formation in the outer parts of the accretion disk for a blazar with single black hole  @xcite or due to impact from the accretion disk of the secondary black hole for a blazar with binary black hole  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism is through the fragmentation of the accretion disk because of dynamical friction from an in - falling satellite onto a coplanar accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "this fragmentation results in the formation and evolution of massive stars in the self - gravitating accretion disks of massive black holes .",
    "the resultant compact objects from the fragmentation remain embedded in the accretion disk and could merge with the parent black hole at the center  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waves are possibly produced from inspirals and mergers of the disk born compact objects ( with masses of about 100  @xmath9 ) with the central black hole .",
    "the expected strain amplitude for the above mechanisms has been estimated to be from @xmath10 to @xmath11 with expected frequency from @xmath6 to @xmath12 hz  @xcite . if a less massive object is formed , the expected frequency of the gravitational wave signal would be higher and could fall into the ligo band .",
    "however , a less massive object will also lead to a significant reduction in the amount of gravitational wave emission .",
    "since the ligo hanford and geo detectors are far apart , we will use gravitational wave coherent network analysis techniques for analyzing this flare .",
    "such coherent network analysis algorithms take into account the antenna patterns for each detector in order to extract the gravitational wave signal from the detector data stream  @xcite .",
    "the ridge  @xcite algorithm ( the name is derived from the term `` ridge regression '' used in statistics literature ) is one such method .",
    "the technique solves the problem of rank deficiency of the antenna response matrix by using tikhonov regularization  @xcite .",
    "more details on ridge and the data conditioning technique used can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we also propose to use the same method in searches for gravitational waves from grbs , magnetars , pulsar glitches , and sco - x1 . for this analysis",
    "we would like to combine the data from the geo detector with the data from the two hanford detectors .",
    "the geo detector is geographically far apart and has different arm orientations with respect to the hanford detectors .",
    "therefore , using geo data would enable us to increase the sensitivity in contrast to searches for gravitational waves from grb 070201  @xcite or sgr 1806 - 20  @xcite , which used the data from only the hanford detectors .",
    "we are also developing a method to look for long - duration ( lasting several seconds to minutes ) transient gravitational wave signals  @xcite , taking into account the motion of the source in the sky .",
    "this method of source tracking involves splitting the dataset into many short duration segments during which the position of the source is approximately constant .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath13 and @xmath14 within each segment knowing the direction to the source .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath13 and @xmath14 is then concatenated across the segments and a test for excess power is applied to this reconstructed time - series . since the flare from pks 2155 - 304 lasted for more than two hours , we plan to apply this source tracking technique .",
    "this method of looking for long duration unmodelled bursts in ligo data could help us find a signal which otherwise may be missed from all sky untriggered searches for gravitational wave bursts  @xcite , which will also analyze the data during this flare .",
    "in order to evaluate the performance of this algorithm , we perform numerical simulations of the detector noise and possible gravitational wave signals .",
    "we then apply the ridge algorithm on this simulated time - series which includes both the detector noise and signal .",
    "we shall then estimate the sensitivity of our search . using receiver operating characteristic curves .    since the flare from pks 2155 - 304 lasted 2000 seconds ,",
    "we need to generate the same duration of simulated noise for h1 , h2 , and geo .",
    "the amplitude spectral density of the simulated noise time series is obtained from the ligo and geo design curves .",
    "we first generate 2000 seconds of gaussian stationary noise using three independent realizations of white noise corresponding to the three detectors .",
    "we then created fir filters with transfer functions matching the design amplitude noise spectral density curves as a function of frequency , for the three instruments .",
    "these were applied to the generated stationary gaussian noise . to generate a realistic simulation of the detector noise we also need to add possible instrumental lines . to model the effect of such lines , sinusoidal signals were added at seven frequencies between 50 and 1050 hz .",
    "the amplitude spectral density of the simulated noise for lho and geo is shown in figure  [ psd ] .    in order to test the performance of this method to possible short - duration gravitational wave signals from pks 2155 - 304 , we need to add simulated burst signals to the generated noise at various times throughout the flare . in its simplest form",
    ", a burst signal can be described by a sine - gaussian waveform , with quality factor @xmath15 , central frequency ( @xmath16 ) and a characteristic amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the waveforms we chose for our simulation were circularly polarized sine - gaussian signals with @xmath17 and @xmath18  hz , and for which the signal in ` @xmath19 ' polarization is phase shifted by @xmath20 with respect to the signal in ` @xmath21 ' polarization . the strength of the signal is characterized by @xmath22 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to waveforms with the ` + ' and ` @xmath21 ' polarizations respectively .",
    "we chose four different values for the signal strength with @xmath23 equal to ( 0.7 , 1.4 , 2.1 , 3.5 ) @xmath24 , this signal was injected at the estimated location of pks 2155 - 304 , which is right ascension = 22 hour and declination = @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the ridge method is now applied to our simulated dataset . at each value of latitude ( @xmath26 ) and longitude ( @xmath27 ) , we maximize the tikhonov regularized likelihood functional  @xcite , by varying @xmath14 and @xmath13 . to distinguish between signals and noise ,",
