    "quantization of continuous random signals ( or random variables and processes ) is an important part of digital representation of analog signals for various coding techniques ( e.g. , source coding , data compression , archiving , restoration ) .",
    "the oldest example of quantization in statistics is rounding off .",
    "sheppard ( see @xcite ) was the first who analyzed rounding off for estimating densities by histograms .",
    "any real number @xmath10 can be rounded off ( or quantized ) to the nearest integer , say @xmath11 $ ] , with a resulting quantization error @xmath12 , for example , @xmath13 .",
    "it means that the restored signal may differ from the original one and some information can be lost .",
    "thus , in quantization of a continuous set of values there is always a distortion ( also known as noise or error ) between the original set of values and the quantized set of values .",
    "one of the main goals in quantization theory is to find a set of quantizers for which the distortion is minimum . for the most comprehensive overview of quantization one can see @xcite ( for later references , see @xcite ) . over the years several authors estimated the distortion measures for quantizers ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . a class of asymptotically optimal quantizers with respect to an @xmath14th - mean error distortion measure is considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    ". a different approach for uniform scalar quantization is developed in @xcite , where the correlation properties of a gaussian process are exploited to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the random quantization rate for uniform quantizers .",
    "general quantization problems for gaussian processes in infinite - dimensional functional spaces are considered in @xcite . in estimating weighted integrals of time series with no quadratic mean derivatives , by means of samples at discrete times , it is known that the rate of convergence of mean - square error is reduced from @xmath15 to @xmath16 when the samples are quantized ( see @xcite ) . for smoother time",
    "series , with @xmath17 quadratic mean derivatives , the rate of convergence is reduced from @xmath18 to @xmath15 when the samples are quantized , which is a very significant reduction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between sampling and quantization is also studied in @xcite , which asymptotically leads to optimal allocation between the number of samples and the number of levels of quantization .",
    "quantization also seems to be a promising tool in recent development in numerical probability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the @xmath20-dimensional euclidean space equipped with a metric @xmath21 compatible with the euclidean topology .",
    "let @xmath0 be a borel probability measure on @xmath19 and @xmath22 be a finite subset of @xmath23 .",

    "it is clear that if @xmath22 is an optimal set of @xmath8-means for @xmath0 , and @xmath50 is a random variable with the probability distribution @xmath0 , then @xmath33 is the expected value of the random variable @xmath50 given that @xmath50 is in @xmath34 .",

    "the arrangement of the paper is as follows : lemma  [ lemma2 ] , lemma  [ lemma11 ] , and lemma  [ lemma12 ] give the optimal sets of @xmath8-means for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "we also gave a tree diagram of the optimal sets of @xmath8-means for a certain range of @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that quantization for homogeneous cantor distributions were investigate by several authors , for example , see @xcite .",
    "but , to the best of our knowledge , the work in this paper is the first advance to investigate the quantization for nonhomogeneous cantor distributions .",
    "the main difference with the homogeneous and the non - homogeneous systems is that for an homogeneous system there is a closed formula for optimal quantizers for @xmath8-means for all @xmath9 , but for the non - homogeneous system , considered in this paper , to obtain the optimal quantizers for @xmath8-means for all @xmath9 a closed formula is not known yet .",
