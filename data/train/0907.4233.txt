    "consider a structure made of sites , connected by links .",
    "each link imposes a constraint , by prescribing the distance between the two sites it connects : if the actual distance between the two sites is different from the prescription , there is an associated energy cost .",
    "rigidity theory deals with properties associated with the structure s topology , which do not depend on the physical nature of the constraints , nor on the precise form of the energy cost .",
    "typical questions asked by rigidity theory are : how many degrees of freedom are left in the system ? is there a macroscopic cluster of sites rigidly connected one with the others ?",
    "by contrast , questions related to the elastic properties of the structure do depend on the specification of the constraints . when the number of links in the structure is increased , the phenomenology is as follows . for a small enough number of links , that is a small mean connectivity of the structure ,",
    "there are many more degrees of freedom than constraints ; there is no macroscopic rigid cluster , and many degrees of freedom are left in the system : the system is said to be floppy . at large mean connectivity , there are many more constraints than degrees of freedom ; there is a macroscopic rigid cluster , and many constraints can not be satisfied : the system is said to be stressed rigid . in between these two phases",
    "takes place the rigidity percolation transition .    despite its clearly mechanical origin",
    ", the problem of rigidity percolation has also attracted attention in the last 30 years because of its applications in understanding the properties of network forming glasses , like gese or geasse alloys  @xcite . in this case , the atomic bonds may be considered as constraints . however , contrary to standard rigidity percolation as presented in the first paragraph , angles between adjacent bonds also need to be considered as constraints , in addition to bond lengths . in the following",
    ", we will concentrate on central force rigidity ( that is when only bond lengths are considered as constraints ) , in two dimensions . beyond the applications to glasses , models of cross linking stiff fibers forming random networks",
    "were shown to fall in the same universality class as central force 2d rigidity  @xcite ; this type of system has been used to model network forming proteins  @xcite .",
    "a decisive theoretical progress was made in the 90 s for _ _ generic _ _ is said to be generic if sites and bonds do not present any `` special '' property , like two parallel bonds , or three aligned sites . for a clear and rigorous presentation of generic 2d rigidity , see for instance  @xcite . ]",
    "2d rigidity , with the introduction of combinatorial algorithms  @xcite , based on laman s theorem  @xcite .",
    "these new algorithms allow for the study of much larger samples than before , as well as more precise estimates around the critical point  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for rigidity percolation on regular lattices , the scenario of a second order phase transition in a different universality class than ordinary percolation seems favored by the numerics , although there has been some debate on the subject  @xcite .    from the analytical point of view however",
    ", progresses have been slow .",
    "a field theoretical attempt by obukhov  @xcite predicts a first order phase transition in 2d , which , when compared with the numerics , seems to be a non generic feature .",
    "some insight came from rigidity models exactly solved on trees and various types of random graphs , with locally tree - like topology  @xcite .",
    "however , in these types of models , the rigidity percolation transition is also usually first order .",
    "this casts doubt on their usefulness to understand generic 2d rigidity .",
    "there has been also earlier attempts to study rigidity percolation through position space renormalization group  @xcite ; based on small renormalization cells , the associated predictions for the critical exponents are unprecise . to this date , we are not aware of any precise analytical prediction for the critical exponents of 2d generic rigidity percolation .",
    "a few years ago , thorpe et al . have opened a new research direction by introducing the notion of network self - organization in rigidity percolation models  @xcite .",
    "this is a natural idea in the context of network glasses modeling : constraints that are not satisfied create stress and bear an energy cost ; the network should then self - organize , i.e. tend to modify its structure , in order to minimize this energy cost . in  @xcite , numerical simulations allowing self organization point to the existence of a new phase in between the usual floppy and rigid ones . as a function of the mean connectivity , the phase diagram",
    "would then show two phase transitions instead of one . around the same time",
    ", several experiments on network glasses drew a picture compatible with this predicted phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "a problem of the original simulations of  @xcite was their strongly out of equilibrium character ; some theoretical studies improved on this , and confirmed the `` three phases '' picture  @xcite . in  @xcite , a class of self - organizing rigidity percolation models is exactly solved , and shows three phases , separated by two true thermodynamic phase transitions . however , these exactly solvable models are based on random networks , which have a locally tree like topology , without small loops .",
    "this strongly influences the critical properties of the rigidity transition ; in particular , as already mentioned above , rigidity percolation is continuous for a regular 2d triangular network , and it is first order in random networks .",
    "the simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite , performed at zero temperature on a triangular lattice , seem to confirm the phenomenology suggested by the locally tree like random networks studies , and show that the entire intermediate phase has a critical nature .",
    "sartbaeva et al . in",
    "@xcite discuss the influence of local structures on the existence and width of the intermediate phase in more realistic network glasses models . despite these works , the question of whether self - organized rigidity percolation on two dimensional networks at finite temperature displays a true `` intermediate phase '' is still open .",
    "we conclude this paragraph by mentioning recent reviews on the subject  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we introduce a new class of solvable models of 2d rigidity , on hierarchical lattices .",
    "these lattices , in contrast with random graphs are not locally tree like , and possess many small loops .",
    "we may then expect for these lattices a phenomenology closer to generic 2d rigidity than random graphs .",
    "it is known that models defined on hierarchical lattices may be exactly solvable , using renormalization transformations  @xcite ; we will use the same ideas in the context of rigidity percolation .",
    "second , in the spirit of  @xcite for random networks , we add to the hierarchical networks the possibility of self - organization .",
    "this provides a new class of exactly solvable models , genuinely different from the random graphs of  @xcite , where it is possible to investigate the existence of an `` intermediate phase '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : generic_rigidity ] , we summarize the combinatorial approach to 2d rigidity , which will be necessary in the following . after introducing , in section  [ sec : hierarchical ] , the class of hierarchical lattices we will be interested in , we solve our model and study its critical properties in section  [ sec : solution ] .",
    "we then introduce the possibility of self - organization for the hierarchical networks , and solve the associated model , in section  [ sec : adaptive ] ; we discuss the implications on the existence of an `` intermediate phase '' , between the usual floppy and stressed rigid ones .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to discussion and perspectives .",
    "an intuitive approach to rigidity percolation , apparently due to maxwell , consists in counting degrees of freedom and constraints . in two dimensions ,",
    "each site has two degrees of freedom ; each link brings one constraint . in the end",
    ", a certain number of degrees of freedom are left .",
    "they correspond to unconstrained motions of the sites , and are usually called `` floppy modes '' . if one thinks of each link as a spring , with a given rest length , floppy modes are motions of the sites that do not change any spring length , and thus do not cost any energy .",
    "any network embedded in two dimensions necessarily has at least three floppy modes , corresponding to the two global translations and the global rotation in the plane .",
    "the network , or a subgraph of the network , is said to be rigid if it has no internal degree of freedom , besides these three . in a first approximation ,",
    "a network with @xmath0 sites and @xmath1 links should have @xmath2 degrees of freedom left , and be rigid if @xmath3 .",
    "this simple computation is obviously wrong in general , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : laman_example ] .",
    "the reason is that when a new bond is added , it may be `` redundant '' : then the constraint associated with this new bond can not be satisfied and its addition does not remove any degree of freedom .",
    "the exact formula giving the number of floppy modes of a network is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of redundant bonds .",
    "the problem is then reduced to the estimation of @xmath5 .",
    "the simplest form of maxwell counting given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : max ] ) assumes that new bonds added in the network first exhaust the degrees of freedom available before starting to become redundant .",
    "it is not correct , but it turns out that a generalization of this idea is actually exact  @xcite .",
    "it may be formulated as follows .",
    "consider a graph , and add a new bond to it .",
    "it is redundant if and only if there exists a subgraph with @xmath6 sites and @xmath7 bonds , containing this new bond , such that @xmath8 .",
    "this combinatorial formulation is at the root of the `` pebble game '' , a powerful algorithm to analyze rigidity percolation on two dimensional networks  @xcite",
    ".     sites . before the addition of the dashed bond",
    ", there are @xmath9 bonds , none of which is redundant .",
    "the number of floppy modes is  @xmath10 : two global translations , one global rotation , and the additional rotation of the one - coordinated site .",
    "the dashed bond is redundant : the subgraph isolated by the dashed curve has @xmath11 sites and @xmath12 bonds .",
    "the whole graph with the dashed bond also has @xmath10 floppy modes , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : flop ] ) .",
    "[ fig : laman_example ] ]",
    "we will consider the following type of hierarchical graphs .",
    "we start from two sites , connected by one bond . the graph is then constructed iteratively ; at each step , all bonds are replaced by a given elementary cell .",
    "four examples of elementary cells , corresponding to four examples of hierarchical graphs , are given on fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchical_examples ] .    , with two sites and one bond ; on the right , the graphs at @xmath13 .",

    "[ fig : hierarchical_examples ] ]    in each case , it is easy to obtain a recursion relation for the number of sites @xmath25 and bonds @xmath26 of the graphs after @xmath23 iterations .",
    "we obtain respectively , for the four graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchical_examples ] @xmath27 solving these recursion relations yields : @xmath28 to model the rigidity percolation phenomenon , we now assume that each bond is effectively present in the graph with probability @xmath29 ; thus , the number of occupied bonds is , for large graphs , @xmath30 .",
    "the maxwell counting procedure yields an estimate of the threshold for rigidity percolation : the approximate critical probability @xmath31 corresponds to a ratio between bonds and sites @xmath32 . for graph on fig .",

    "all three graphs should then present a rigidity transition at @xmath34 .",
    "we will mainly concentrate in the following on graph @xmath14 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the goal is to compute a recursion relation relating @xmath38 , the number of redundant bonds of a graph iterated @xmath23 times , with a bond occupation probability @xmath29 , and @xmath39 , the number of redundant bonds of a graph iterated @xmath24 times , with a bond occupation probability @xmath40 .",

    "analyzing one renormalization step , we write @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents all the redundant bonds that where suppressed in the renormalization process .",
    "this formula needs some justification .",
    "consider the empty ( without bonds ) graph at step @xmath23 , and add the bonds one by one , checking each time if the newly added bond is redundant or not ; this is actually the numerical strategy implemented in the `` pebble game '' algorithm .",
    "if the added bond is redundant , it is discarded .",
    "thus , during the process , the constructed graph has at most one redundant bond . if an added bond is redundant , it is possible to find a subgraph @xmath51 , containing this new bond , with @xmath6 sites and @xmath52 bonds .",
    "we choose @xmath51 as small as possible .",
    "there are now two possibilities .",
    "either @xmath51 is included in one elementary cell ; in this case the redundant bond is included in the @xmath50 contribution . or @xmath51 is not included in an elementary cell .",

    "@xmath51 , which is included in the graph at step @xmath23 will then be renormalized in a natural way in a subgraph of the graph at step @xmath24 . the redundant constraint is thus included in the @xmath53 contribution to eq .",

    "it is worth mentioning that both the hierarchical nature of the graph and the convenient combinatorial description of 2d rigidity outlined in section  [ sec : generic_rigidity ] are necessary for this step . in particular , it is not clear how to construct exactly solvable hierarchical models of 3d rigidity .    for a given bond probability @xmath29",

    ", it is known that these exponents , computed on such hierarchical networks , can not be taken as reliable estimates for the exponents associated to regular lattices .",
    "however , these exponents may converge to the correct ones when one considers larger and larger cells for the hierarchical networks  @xcite .",
    "one may then think of a large cell monte carlo renormalization procedure to obtain an estimation of the critical exponents for 2d generic rigidity percolation .",
    "some words of caution are in order : it is not clear how to extend to large sizes the hierarchical networks considered in this paper , nor if they may be a good approximation of a regular lattice , even for large cell sizes .",
    "it may be necessary to introduce other types of hierarchical lattices .",
    "our second result concerns the effect of self organization on rigidity percolation , for these hierarchical models .",
    "we define and solve exactly a model where the network may adapt its structure to avoid stress , at an entropic cost . at variance with what happens for random networks ,",
    "the possibility of self - organization does not introduce a qualitative change in the phase diagram .",
    "in particular , there is no true thermodynamic `` intermediate phase '' . it may still be possible to define an `` intermediate region '' , where the network is close to be isostatic , and the stress does not percolate , although it is present locally .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the properties of this `` intermediate region '' with the picture of the intermediate phase drawn from a size increasing cluster approximation  @xcite . from the modeling point of view",
    ", we note that a scenario where sharp phase transitions are replaced by smoother cross - overs may still be compatible with the experiments on network glasses .",
    "all our analysis relies on the combinatorial description of 2d generic rigidity .",
    "it should be possible to study similar hierarchical models of 3d rigidity with bond bending constraints , using the associated combinatorial description  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear however how to generalize the technique to 3d networks with central forces only , as there is no simple combinatorial description in that case  ( see  @xcite for a recent discussion ) ."
