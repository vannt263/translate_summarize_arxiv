    "eclipse timing provides us with powerful fiducial marks to investigate the orbital period evolution in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; e.g. chou 2014 ) .",
    "this observable is closely associated with angular momentum variations of the system .",
    "in fact , any physical mechanism modifying the system angular momentum will inevitably modify the binary orbital period .",
    "the orbit can evolve as a consequence of mass transfer between the two stars ( e.g. due to roche lobe overflow ) , gravitational wave radiation ( landau lifschitz 1958 ; paczynski 1967 ; faulkner 1971 ; verbunt 1993 ) , magnetic breaking ( eggleton 1976 ; verbunt & zwaan 1981 ; rappaport et al .",
    "1983 ) , mass loss from the companion , accretion disc winds , jets or other types of outflows ( e.g. fender et al . 2004 ; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ) , and tidal interactions between the components of the binary system ( lear et al .",
    "1976 ) .",
    "the theory of angular momentum evolution due to mass transfer via roche lobe overflow and gravitational wave radiation is well established and leads to quantitative predictions ( landau lifschitz 1958 ; paczynski 1967 ; faulkner 1971 ; verbunt 1993 ) .",
    "however , angular momentum losses due to emission of gravitational waves only dominate at short orbital period ( @xmath3  hr ) , while other mechanisms , such as magnetic breaking , are invoked to explain the orbit evolution at longer periods .",
    "the theory at the heart of the magnetic breaking model is based on the same physical principles through which magnetic stellar winds are known to decelerate the rotation of low - mass stars ( e.g. kraft 1967 ; skumanich 1972 ; sonderblom 1983 ) . in synchronised binaries",
    "( typically the case of lmxbs ) , the angular momentum loss from the companion star is continuously re - distributed to the angular momentum of the whole binary system , therefore affecting its orbital period and binary separation ( e.g. taurus 2001 ) .",
    "large uncertainties are involved in the extrapolation of magnetic breaking from isolated low - mass stars to the case of synchronised companion stars in lmxbs ( e.g. see discussion in knigge et al .",
    "2011 ) . indeed , despite the large allowed range of model parameters ( possibly translating into more than one order of magnitude on efficiency of angular momentum removal )",
    ", magnetic breaking often fails to reproduce measured values of the orbital period derivative , at least in the case of conservative mass transfer ( di salvo et al .",

    "additional mechanisms , typically involving outflows , are generally necessary to explain these discrepancies ( di salvo et al .",

    "we study for the first time the evolution of the orbital period of   over an interval of more than 20 years by using data from 15 years of   monitoring campaign of the galactic centre as well as data from the  archive .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we analysed all  ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) observations of  over the period november 2001 - april 2015 .",
    "in addition to the observations analysed in ponti et al .",
    "( 2015a ) , we include ten new  observations , taken during outburst ( see table [ ectimes ] for a full list of  observations considered in this work ) .",
    "the epic pn camera aboard  occasionally experiences time jumps .",
    "we checked that all the positive and negative jumps are properly corrected by the epic pn reduction pipeline .",
    "this is further confirmed by the fact that similar results are obtained with the epic mos camera that is not affected by these time jumps .",
    "the arrival times of all events were corrected to the solar system barycentre , applying the barycen task of sas .",
    "we processed the data sets using the latest version ( 14.0.0 ) of the  science analysis system ( sas ) and applied the most recent ( july 2015 ) calibrations .",
    "we use all the epic ( struder et al . 2001 ) cameras . having higher effective area ,",
    "our prime instrument is the epic - pn ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) , but we also analysed the epic - mos , for a consistency check . all observations have the medium filter applied and are in full frame mode , therefore the epic - pn and epic - mos light curves have minimum time resolutions of 73.4  ms and 2.6  s , respectively .",
    "since the main focus of this work is to measure the ingress / egress times and durations of the eclipses , increasing the number of source photons would provide a more accurate determination of the location of the transition points .",
    "therefore , even if photon pile - up significantly affects the brightest observations we decided to retain all source photons ( e.g. by not removing photons from the central part of the point spread function as in ponti et al .",
    "pile - up is expected to have a negligible effect on the determination of the eclipse timing .",
    "the source and background photons are extracted from circular regions with 40  arcsec and 160  arcsec radii , respectively .",
    "the former centred on , while the latter covers a region free from bright point - like sources and low levels of diffuse emission .    for each observation we identified periods of enhanced particle - induced background activity by inspecting the 6 - 15 kev source and background light curves binned with 5  s resolution .",
    "we filtered out periods with a background level 25  % brighter than the average source count rate during the observation .",
    "type i bursts have been removed , if clearly detected in 1  s source light curves .",
    "we note that type i burst were not detected either at the start , during or at the end of any eclipse",
    ".    to establish the x - ray state of the source ( see section [ state ] ) , we used the hardness intensity diagram shown in fig . 2 of ponti et al .",
    "( 2015b ) , based on fluxes in the 3 - 6 and 6 - 10  kev bands .",
    "when present , pile - up can significantly affect these measurements . to mitigate this we removed ( only for this specific analysis ) the central 9.25  arcsec in the source extraction region , such as done by ponti et al .",
    "( 2014 ; 2015 ) . using the epic pn data with a time resolution of 73.4  ms we searched for the presence of pulsations during observation obsid : 0402430301 and 0690441801 ( the longest observations where the source is bright in the soft and hard state , respectively ) but did not detect any significant pulsed signal .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    to significantly extend the time interval probed by the  pointings , we also examined  observations .",
    "data were obtained from the heasarc database online , and screened event files were used in our analysis . as reported by maeda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the source was found in outburst in 1993 and 1994 .",
    "however , no eclipses were found in the 1993 data due to the short duration of the observation ( additionally the source flux was about 5 times fainter than in 1994 ) .",
    "maeda et al . ( 1996 ) reported the discovery of eclipses with a 8.4  hr periodicity in the 1994 data .",
    "we thus analysed this dataset , extracting photons from a radius of 0.8  arcmin as done by maeda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and combining data from the two gis instruments , which have a higher time resolution than the sis .",
    "we filtered photons so as to include only those in the 3 - 10 kev range .",
    "photon arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the timeconv task of ftools .",
    "finally , we found one eclipse fully covered by the observation , in the constructed light curve , which we used for our timing analysis .",
    "sakano et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also reported a detection of the source by asca in 1997 .",
    "however , the source flux was significantly weaker in this observation ( similar to the levels in 1993 ) , and only a hint of an eclipse was present in their folded light curve .",
    "therefore we did not include the 1997 data in our analysis .",
    "the determination of the eclipse times in all data sets was done using the bayesian block technique ( scargle et al .",
    "2013 ; ponti et al .",
    "the technique allows us to detect statistically significant changes in count rates for time - tagged event data , along with a determination of the corresponding times .",
    "we first selected the source photons from the cleaned event files and then we applied the bayesian block code on the photon arrival times .",
    "we performed this on all the data sets .",
    "we typically ran the bayesian block code over an entire observation , except for observations with intense dipping activity and long exposures , where we split the event files into smaller segments , each containing one orbital period so that the routine converges in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the eclipse ingress and egress times are singled out without ambiguity by using this technique .",
    "figure [ lcurve ] shows the average source light curve during one orbit ( obtained by averaging over all orbits , after removing type i bursts ) ; phases are defined so that the centre of the eclipse is at 0.5 . at the time of eclipse ingress , the source flux abruptly decreases and then it sharply increases again by a similar amount at the time of the egress .",
    "note that during the eclipse , a residual flux is present which displays a gradual decay near ingress .",
    "it has been suggested that this behaviour is due to a dust scattering halo ( hyodo et al .",
    "2009 ) . in agreement with this interpretation",
    ", we observe that the amplitude of this effect steeply decreases at higher energies and is of the same order of magnitude as expected for the large column density of material toward the source ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ; ponti et al .",
    "a detailed study of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper .    at low fluxes ,",
    "most of the observed eclipses are well described by a single block . in these cases",
    "we define ingress and egress times as the start and end times of the block .",
    "however , for observations with higher source count rates , the presence of the slow decay during the eclipse induces one additional significant block at the start of the eclipse .",
    "whenever an additional block appears , we define as ingress time , the start of the first block marking the eclipse and as egress time , the end of the last block marking the eclipse ( see fig . [ lcurve ] ) . by using this method",

    "[ quad ] ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of a unique orbital solution in  and that the physical mechanism changing the angular momentum in   is most probably different from that at work in .      by combining the paczynski ( 1971 ) approximate formula for the roche - lobe radius with kepler s third law ,",
    "it is possible to derive the average density of the companion star from the system orbital period . assuming that the companion is a main sequence star",

    "( 2010 ; see also verbunt & zwaan 1981 ; king 1988 ; verbunt 1993 ; tauris 2001 ) we express the magnetic breaking term as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the radius of gyration of the star @xmath81 in units of 0.277 ( we assume @xmath82 ) ; @xmath83 is a dimensionless parameter of order unity with preferred values of @xmath84 ( skumanich 1972 ) or @xmath85 ( smith 1979 ) .",
    "we chose here the value that maximises the effect of magnetic breaking ( @xmath84 ) , which results in @xmath86 .",
    "we observe that in a conservative scenario the orbital period derivative induced by gravitational radiation alone would be @xmath87 , while it would be @xmath88 , if magnetic breaking were at work instead of @xmath89 ) , the orbital period evolution is slower , @xmath90  s  s@xmath91 . in the same way ,",
    "if the companion is partly degenerate and thus has a lower mass ( e.g. @xmath92 ) , a slower evolution would be expected , @xmath93  s  s@xmath91 . ] .",
    "we note that even the latter estimate is about one order of magnitude smaller than the observed value .",
    "we thus conclude that a conservative mass transfer scenario does not reproduce the behaviour of the source",
    ". therefore , non conservative mass transfer appears to be required .",
    "superposed on the long - term evolution of the orbital period , highly significant jitter ( @xmath2  s ) is observed .",
    "it is unlikely that the residual jitter originates from geometry variations of either the central x - ray source or the inner accretion disc , since these are small and get rapidly eclipsed by the rim of the companion star .",
    "in fact , at a velocity of @xmath94  km  s@xmath91 , the companion star would swipe through the region where the bulk of the x - ray luminosity is produced , say @xmath95  r@xmath96 in less than @xmath97  s ( here r@xmath96 is the gravitational radius defined as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the speed of light , @xmath100 is the gravitational constant and @xmath101 is the mass of the compact source ) .",
    "it is in theory possible that part of the observed jitter is associated to oscillations of the companion star atmosphere . for example",
    ", tidal forces could induce oscillations of the companion star .",
    "it is also well known that the magnetic activity in the sun generates coronal loops extending several thousands kilometers above the photosphere .",
    "the presence of such structure on the surface of the companion star would explain the amplitude of the observed jitter .",
    "one such event has been claimed in  ( wolff et al .",
    "however , were such effects at work in , they would either modify the ingress and egress time in a random fashion ( in the case of coronal loops ) , or in an anti - correlated way ( i.e. , ingress delayed and egress advanced or vice - versa , in case of oscillations of the companion star atmosphere ) .",
    "therefore , in all these cases , a variation of the duration of the eclipse , with comparable amplitude to the observed jitter , would be expected . on the contrary we observe a nearly constant eclipse duration in .",
    "the correlation between ingress and egress residuals suggest that jitter is caused by the whole companion star being either `` delayed '' or `` advanced '' with respect to the expected long term orbital period evolution .",
    "in particular , the hard state eclipses arrive , on average , @xmath102  s before the expected time , while the soft state eclipses arrive very close to the expected time with an average delay of @xmath103  s. a possibility would be the displacement of the center of mass of the system , by the presence of a third body . to investigate this , we fitted doppler shifts in the time of arrival due to the orbital velocity in the presence of a third body in an elliptical orbit ( adapting equations from schreirer et al .",
    "1972 and mukherjee et al .",
    "the sparse sampling of the orbital evolution allows several possible solutions .",
    "however none of these solution is completely satisfactory .",
    "indeed , they either provide an unlikely high eccentricity ( higher than 0.999 ) or they predict ( unlikely ) large residuals ( @xmath104  s ) during the unsampled periods .",
    "moreover , the observed periodicities are multiples of half a year and likely arise from the  observing window of the galactic centre ( observable for @xmath4  months with a cadence of six months ) : therefore they might be spurious .",
    "moreover , the connection between the eclipse timing and the x - ray source accretion state remains to be explained in the third body interpretation .",
    "we can also exclude that the center of mass could be modified by an asymmetric disc with a state dependent geometry , even though the outer disc bulge , generating dips , is observed to have a state - dependent behaviour .",
    "this would require an unrealistically high amount of mass ( @xmath105  m@xmath61 ) to be stored in the bulge to produce the observed jitter .",
    "we note that lmxb typically show durations of the eclipse transitions ( _ i.e. _ duration of ingress and egress ) of the order of 5 - 20  s ( cominsky & wood 1989 ; wachter et al .",
    "2000 ; wolff et al .",
    "interestingly , these are comparable to the jitter observed in .",
    "transition time scales are related to the atmospheric scale height of the companion star ( indeed they correspond to @xmath106  km at a velocity of @xmath107  km  s@xmath91 ) .",
    "shows the presence of a highly ionised plasma above the disc , with turbulent velocities of the order of @xmath108  km  s@xmath91 , temperatures of @xmath109  k and densities of order @xmath110  @xmath111 ( ponti et al .",
    "2012 ; 2014 ; 2015 ) .",
    "if such plasma travels to the orbit of the companion star without gaining additional angular momentum ( _ i.e. _ maintaining the angular momentum characteristic of the outer parts of the accretion disc ) it will not be in corotation with the companion star , which orbits at a speed of @xmath112  km  s@xmath91 .",
    "if so , this plasma will exert a ram pressure on the atmosphere of the star of the order of : @xmath113  @xmath114  km  s@xmath115  dy  @xmath6 , where @xmath75 is the plasma density and @xmath116 the velocity difference ( assumed to be @xmath117  @xmath111 and @xmath118  km  s@xmath91 , respectively ) .",
    "this pressure is comparable to the pressure in the upper layers of a k type star atmosphere .",
    "therefore , it could displace the position of the companion star atmosphere delaying both the ingress time and the egress time ( although to a lesser extent , compared to the ingress time ) .",
    "the eclipse might appear therefore delayed and shortened during the soft state , with the ingress time being more affected than the egress time .",
    "no such effect would be present during the hard state , when the disc ionised atmosphere is not present ( ponti et al .",
    "we note that , in this scenario , during the soft state , the ram pressure would act on the companion star , slowing down its motion , and therefore affecting the orbital evolution of the system .",
    "this would correspond to an additional contribution to the orbital period evolution of @xmath119  s / s ( during the soft state only ) .",
    "finally we note that both the source luminosity and spectral energy distribution change significantly between the two canonical states .",
    "in particular , the bottom panel of fig .  [ res_state ] shows a correlation between the source count rate and the observed delay .",
    "different levels of irradiation might affect the atmospheric layers of the companion star enhancing mass transfer rate and/or mass loss ( e.g. , tavani 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , the geometry and physical conditions of the accretion disc are known to be significantly different in the two states .",
    "the hard state being characterised by a jet component and an inefficient disc , while the soft state showcasing a standard disc and an ionised atmosphere ( fender et al .",
    "2004 ; done et al . 2007 ;",
    "ponti et al .",
    "it appears plausible that different types of outflows , potentially driving away significant amounts of angular momentum and kinetic power , are present in the different states ( e.g. jets in the hard state , winds in the soft state ; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ; fender & muoz - darias 2015 ) .",
    "it is possible that either through irradiation , outflows or other mechanisms the system might lose angular momentum in a different way along the different accretion states .",
    "the uncertainty on the block change times ( i.e. the eclipses ) was first determined using the method suggested in scargle et al .",
    "this method allows us to compute the probability of change times for each block as a function of the photon arrival times , which peaks at the best fit block time .",
    "since the probabilities thus obtained is a discrete distribution , we construct confidence intervals for change times by calculating the smallest symmetric interval around the best fit time which , in total , contains a given confidence level .",
    "the reported uncertainties , in all cases , are at a confidence level of 68% .",
    "the red circles in fig . [ unc ] ( both in the main figure and in the inset ) show these uncertainties obtained from the epic pn data .",
    "the magenta triangles in the inset of fig .",
    "[ unc ] show , instead , the bayesian block estimates for the mos1 data . we observe that , for similar source brightness",
    ", the uncertaintie determined in this way span a range from @xmath120  s , that appears relatively large .",
    "in particular , unreliably small uncertainties , as small as @xmath121  s , are often observed .",
    "we note that , as clearly stated in scargle et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , this method to determine the uncertainties on the block change times is approximate .",
    "we also estimated the uncertainties based on the observed scatter on the simultaneous observation of the eclipse change points ( e.g. egress time ) with the three epic cameras .",
    "the observed scatter ( difference between the three measurements of the change times ) will be equal or larger than the intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "for each eclipse we define as ingress and egress time the weighted average of the measurements obtained by the three epic cameras and we measure the scatter compared to this average .",
    "we then sort the eclipses in source mean flux ( over the orbital period ) and group the eclipses in order to have at least 4 eclipses in each bin .",
    "we finally average the observed scatter over the 4 eclipses ( therefore over a total of 12 data points ) .",
    "the yellow squares in fig . [ unc ] show the averaged uncertainties obtained in this way .",
    "the vertical coloured stripes show the width of the bin over which the scatter has been averaged .",
    "we observe an overall good agreement between the two estimates of the uncertainties . however , we note that the uncertainties derived through the method suggested by scargle et al .",
    "( 2013 ) show a too large scatter .",
    "in particular , the inset of fig .",
    "[ unc ] reports a comparison between the uncertainty measured by the bayesian block method from the epic pn and mos1 data ( the axes report the same quantities as the main panel ) .",
    "we observe that in several occasions the mos1 camera has uncertainties about one order of magnitude smaller than the pn camera , for the same eclipse , despite the smaller effective area .",
    "therefore , we prefer to be conservative and use the second estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "we also note that , as expected , the uncertainties become smaller when the source is brighter .",
    "we then fit this trend , so that we can associate to any observed source flux an uncertainty on the determination of the change point and use the latter as uncertainties .",
