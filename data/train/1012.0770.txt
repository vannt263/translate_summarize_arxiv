    "the watson - crick double helix structure of dna derives its stability from the phosphodiester bonds in the single - stranded sugar backbone , and from the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs on opposite strands @xcite . in practice ,",
    "access to the inside of the double helix , and therefore , the unzipping of a specific region of base pairs is essential for all physiological processes involving dna , e.g. , for replication , transcription , and protein binding @xcite .    several mechanisms , like heating @xcite ,",
    "changing the ph of the environment @xcite , and application of external force @xcite can lead to unzipping of the double - stranded dna .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as dna denaturation .",
    "the process occurs progressively , starting with the double strand separating locally into single strands to form loops , or , `` bubbles '' .",
    "these bubbles fluctuate in size through stepwise zipping and unzipping of the base pairs at the two zipper forks where the bubble connects to the double strand . at low temperatures , bubbles once formed eventually close again in time . with the increase of temperature ,",
    "however , the bubbles grow in size in time to ultimately coalesce with neighboring bubbles and complete the denaturation process .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath9 is defined as that at which half of the dna molecule is denatured , and has typical values @xmath10c for standard salt solutions @xcite .",
    "the number of bubbles varies from only a few ones well below @xmath9 up to several hundreds close to @xmath9 .",
    "breathing dynamics , referring to the dynamics of fluctuating dna bubbles , has been a topic of intense research for many years @xcite . it has recently regained interest with the development of new experimental tools that allow for the direct observation of the dynamics of a single dna molecule @xcite . on the theoretical side , various methods have been used to study different aspects of the breathing process @xcite , and to investigate the interaction of the dna with binding proteins : the master equation approach @xcite , a stochastic gillespie scheme @xcite , the fokker - planck equation approach based on the poland - scheraga free energy function @xcite , and stochastic dynamic simulations based on the dauxios - peyrard - bishop model @xcite .",
    "specifically , the thermally - induced denaturation problem has been recently studied by mapping it onto a quantum coulomb problem @xcite .",
    "these studies have enhanced our understanding of general aspects of both polymer dynamics as well as specific biochemical processes . for recent advances , see @xcite .",
    "dna breathing occurs on a timescale shorter than the equilibration time of the single strands forming the bubbles @xcite .",
    "based on this observation , breathing dynamics may be regarded as a random walk in the one - dimensional coordinate @xmath11 , the number of broken base pairs . ignoring heterogeneity in the dna structure",
    ", this random walk may be modeled as a noisy overdamped motion at a finite temperature @xmath12 on the poland - scheraga free energy landscape , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( which can be of either sign ) are defined later in the paper .",
    "as we show below , this form of the free energy implies a crossover scale @xmath16 . for small bubbles ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the random walk takes place in a potential @xmath18 . in the opposite limit ,",
    "the potential grows linearly with @xmath11 , thereby implying a different dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the sign of @xmath15 , as given by the system temperature , determines the nature ( attractive / repulsive ) of the potential . for @xmath19 , which happens at temperatures @xmath20 ,",
    "the potential is attractive for all bubble sizes , thereby implying an eventual bubble closure ( @xmath21 ) . on the other hand , above @xmath9 , when @xmath22 , a large bubble ( @xmath23 ) evolves under a repulsive linear potential to grow in size toward full denaturation , while a small bubble ( @xmath17 ) may still shrink in size to closure under the influence of the attractive @xmath24 potential .    in this work ,",
    "following the above picture , we complement previous single - bubble studies by suggesting and analyzing new measures for exploring the dna breathing process .",
    "we focus on several first - passage  brownian \" functionals @xcite of the fluctuating bubble , which eventually closes again , and derive their probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "we separately study the small and large bubble limits , which exhibit different behaviors .",
    "the functionals of interest characterize the lifetime of the bubble , the time - integrated bubble size till the first - passage time ( the bubble  area \" ) , its maximum size before closure , and the characteristic time for attaining the maximum size .",
    "these measures are relevant for estimating the effective reactivity of the bubble , e.g. , its efficiency for binding processes .",
    "another objective of this work is to advocate the use of the recently studied backward fokker - planck ( bfp ) method @xcite and the path decomposition ( pd ) method @xcite , which builds on the feynman - kac formalism @xcite , for exploring dna bubble dynamics .",
    "these techniques have been extremely useful in studying many aspects of classical brownian motion , as well as for exploring related problems in computer science and astronomy @xcite . here ,",
    "for the first time , we adopt these elegant methods in the context of dna breathing dynamics . using the bfp method",
    ", we derive and solve differential equations for the laplace transforms of various brownian functionals .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard fokker - planck treatment , which yields the distribution function to obtain a bubble of a given size at a given time @xcite . utilizing the pd approach",
    ", we can calculate the distribution functions of interest by splitting a representative path of the dynamics into parts , and then considering the weight of each part separately .",
    "this is justified by the markovian property of the dynamics .    in order to gain a qualitative understanding of the dna breathing process",
    ", we separately consider the cases of small and large bubbles .",
    "our analysis reveals new scaling laws for the pdfs of various brownian functionals , which are evidently distinct for small and large bubbles .",
    "we further compare our analytical predictions with direct numerical simulations of the corresponding langevin equation and observe a very good agreement in the appropriate limits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2",

    "correspondingly , the langevin dynamics ( [ eq : lang2 ] ) is essentially governed by the term @xmath48 . for large bubbles with @xmath23 ,",
    "the base - pair dissociation term @xmath49 dominates the free energy , and correspondingly , it is the @xmath50 term which dictates the langevin dynamics . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the langevin dynamics occurs in an attractive potential for all bubble sizes , thereby ensuring eventual bubble closure . above @xmath9 , large bubbles with @xmath23",
    "grow in size under a repulsive linear potential to ultimately yield full denaturation , while a small bubble with @xmath17 may evolve towards closure under the influence of the attractive @xmath24 potential .",
    "we will utilize below the length scale ( [ eq : x1 ] ) in distinguishing between small and large bubbles .",
    "note that at precisely the melting temperature @xmath9 , when @xmath52 and the characteristic bubble size diverges , the langevin dynamics becomes identical to that for small bubbles at all temperatures @xmath53 .",

    "a related quantity is the survival probability @xmath57 which can be inferred from experiments by measuring fluorescence correlations of a tagged dna @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ area under a path . _ for the path described by eq . ( [ eq : lang2 ] ) , we define the area under the path before the first - passage time as @xmath58 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and calculate its pdf @xmath3 .",
    "this quantity is of interest since it provides a measure for the effectiveness of breathing - assisted processes , i.e. , binding of proteins to the reactive sites of the dna bases . as an example , consider a process that can take place only inside the double helix , on the single - stranded dna .",
    "let us assume that this process is facilitated with increasing bubble size , and that it requires a sufficiently long bubble lifetime .",
    "while the first - passage time distribution provides information about the average bubble lifetime , it does not contain any hint of the average bubble size before closure .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 , the distribution of the maximum bubble opening before closure provides a measure for the bubble size , but it does not inform us about the corresponding timescale .",
    "thus , we propose the pdf @xmath3 of the area @xmath4 covered till the first - passage time as a useful quantity that provides a measure of bubble reactivity by containing information about both size of the bubble and its characteristic lifetime .",
    "\\(iii ) _ maximum bubble size @xmath6 . _ another proposed measure for quantifying bubble reactivity is the distribution of the maximum bubble size before the first - passage time , @xmath5 .",
    "consider again a binding process taking place only inside the double helix .",
    "assume next that , due to geometrical constraints , the process may materialize only when the bubble is large enough .",
    "if the timescale of this process is very short , shorter than the average bubble lifetime , a relevant measure for the bubble reactivity is its maximum opening before closure .    quantities ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) will be calculated below by following the backward fokker - planck method discussed in section [ bfpmethod ] .",
    "\\(iv ) _ maximum size @xmath6 and the corresponding time @xmath8 . _",
    "the joint probability distribution function @xmath7 will be investigated here by following the pd method , which builds on the feynman - kac formalism @xcite ; see section [ pdmethod ] . using this pdf , one can further calculate the distribution function @xmath59 of the time at which the bubble attains its maximum size before closure .",
    "this latter pdf is of interest since it provides information about the ( average ) time of occurrence of the biggest bubble before closure .",
