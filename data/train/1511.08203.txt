    "obtaining accurate and precise ages for large numbers of stars in the milky way is a crucial ingredient in the comparison of observed data to galaxy formation simulations .",
    "it is also a first step towards understanding empirically how our galaxy formed and how it evolved to its present - day structure .",
    "stellar ages are unfortunately very hard to determine ( see for example @xcite ) : they can not be directly measured , and are always model - dependent .",
    "a powerful way to measure ages for large samples of stars is to determine their location in the hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram ( hrd ) , and to compare this location with theoretical isochrones @xcite .",
    "this technique yields precise ages in regions of the hrd where isochrones of different ages are clearly separated , namely , at the main - sequence turn - off and on the subgiant branch .",
    "by contrast , on the red giant branch , isochrones of different ages are very close in temperature , so that they can not be robustly used to determine ages .",
    "however , giant stars are crucial probes of the structure of the milky way , and routine age estimates for giants would be of enormous importance : their high luminosity makes them observable out to large distances ; and the giants in old and young ( @xmath5  gyr ) populations have comparable luminosities and colours , making their selection function far more age - uniform than in the case of turn - off stars . as a consequence , they are the primary targets in a growing number of surveys , including the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) , a high - resolution spectroscopic survey in the h - band @xcite .    because the mass of a star and its main - sequence lifetime are tightly correlated , ages for giants can be directly inferred from their mass .",
    "this has recently become the realm of asteroseismology , which can probe the internal structure of stars , not just their surface properties .",
    "thanks to the corot @xcite , _ kepler _ @xcite , and now k2 space missions , solar - like oscillations have been detected in thousands of red giants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for stars up to 8 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "solar - like oscillations are pulsations that are stochastically excited by convective turbulence in the stellar envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these oscillation modes are regularly spaced in frequency and contain information on the structure of the star .",
    "a first method to determine the properties of a star is to directly fit for the individual seismic frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gives a great precision on stellar masses and radii . however , it is very time - consuming and computationally - intensive and thus can only be done for small numbers of stars at a time .",
    "a simpler way to extract information from the power spectrum of the oscillations is to measure two global asteroseismic parameters : @xmath6 , the frequency separation of two modes of same spherical degree and consecutive radial order , and @xmath7 , the frequency of maximal oscillation power .",
    "a set of scaling relations directly links these two fundamental parameters to the mass and radius of a given star , so that the mass can be derived as @xmath8 ( see section 3.5 for more details ) .",
    "ages can then be inferred by comparing the seismic data to theoretical isochrones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which leads to typical age uncertainties of the order of 30% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , asteroseismology data are currently available only for relatively small samples of stars , located in a few different fields in the milky way . future space missions like plato and tess will have a larger sky coverage . in the meantime",
    ", it is very important to look for methods to determine stellar masses and ages that can be applied to large numbers of stars over a large volume of the galaxy .",
    "this paper is a first step towards using the information present in the apogee stellar spectra of giant stars to derive their masses and ages .",
    "our work was inspired by @xcite , who use the variations of carbon and nitrogen abundances between stars in the milky way s thin and thick disks to gather information on the relative ages of stars in both structures . carbon and nitrogen are indeed expected to be good indicators of stellar masses : as a star arrives on the giant branch , its convective envelope extends deep into the star and brings up to the stellar surface material that has processed through the cno cycle ( this is called the first dredge - up ) . as a result of the convective mixing , the outer atmosphere will display signatures of this evolution , in particular a change in observed [ c / n ] ratio at the stellar surface @xcite . because the [ c / n ] ratio in the core and the depth reached by the dredge - up depend on stellar mass , the final [ c / n ] ratio at the surface depends on stellar mass .",
    "since mass and age are closely related for stars on the giant branch , this also means that the [ c / n ] ratio can be used to infer stellar ages @xcite .",
    "there is however some scatter in model predictions , partly because the exact mixing processes affecting the surface abundances are still debated .",
    "it is thus tricky to directly use model predictions to link c and n abundances to stellar mass and age .",
    "our approach is to empirically determine the relationship between c and n abundances ( and other stellar labels ) and stellar mass in the apokasc sample : there are currently 1,475 stars for which both apogee high - quality spectroscopic information and _ kepler _ asteroseismology information are available . in that sample ,",
    "we find a strong correlation between mass , metallicity , and c and n abundances .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a fit to this relation , which can then be applied to a larger sample of apogee stars for which no _ kepler _ data is available .    in a parallel paper ,",
    "@xcite use _ the cannon _ to confirm that apogee spectra contain information on stellar masses or ages .",
    "_ the cannon _ is a new data - driven approach to determine stellar parameters from spectroscopic data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "with no prior knowledge of stellar evolution or stellar atmospheres , _ the cannon _ learns a mapping between wavelength and stellar parameters .",
    "@xcite show that _ the cannon _ can also extract mass / age information from the apogee spectra , and that the spectral regions that contain the most mass information correspond to cn and co molecules .",
    "in this present work , our approach directly links stellar masses to the stellar parameters derived by the apogee pipeline from the stellar spectra , without using the spectra themselves . in section [ sec : cnocycles ] , we review the theoretical expectations for the correlation between mass and [ c / n ] for giants .",
    "we then describe in section [ sec : sample ] the sample of stars we use , in particular , how we derive their masses and ages . in section [ sec :",
    "observedcorrelation ] , we present the observed correlations between mass and chemical abundances in the apokasc sample .",
    "we then explain how we fit these correlations , discuss the performance of the models and the remaining biases ( section [ sec : model ] ) . in section [ sec : dr12 ] , we finally conclude the paper with an application of our models to the whole apogee sample , and present the correlations between the derived masses / ages with [ @xmath4/m]and metallicity , and with location in the galaxy .",
    "the two coloured lines show theoretical evolutionary tracks from @xcite for solar metallicity stars of 1 and 1.5 m@xmath2 , also colour - coded by the predicted surface [ c / n].at the very bottom of the rgb , stars have a larger [ c / n ] , which indicates that they have not experienced the first dredge - up yet . the black box shows how we select these pre dredge - up stars in dr12.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    ) .",
    "the top panel shows that the two samples have a similar distribution of [ ( c+n)/m ] as a function of metallicity [ m / h ] .",
    "the combined abundance of carbon and nitrogen does not change during the dredge - up , and hence reflects the birth properties of stars and how chemical evolution proceeds in the milky way .",
    "this shows that these two samples of stars have the same birth properties .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the apokasc giants have a lower [ c / n ] , which is due to the dredge - up that these stars have experienced.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the cno cycle consists in a series of nuclear reactions during which c , n and o atoms act as catalysts in the conversion of hydrogen to helium ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the total quantity of c , n , and o atoms is globally preserved during the nuclear reactions , their relative abundances evolve with time .",
    "more specifically , the slowest reaction in the cno cycle corresponds to the proton capture on @xmath9n , so that at equilibrium nitrogen becomes the most abundant element . in more detail",
    ", the cno cycle produces an increase of the abundance in @xmath9n in the stellar core , a decrease in @xmath10c , a reduction of the ratio of @xmath10c/@xmath11c to @xmath32030 ( to be compared to a solar value of @xmath390 , see @xcite ) , and a very slight change in @xmath12o .    at the end of the main sequence",
    ", the stellar interior is thus made of layers of material enriched in various elements .",
    "the exact shape of these layers can be affected by rotation during the main sequence ( see for instance figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the total amount of cno - processed material in the core depends on stellar mass : stars with a higher mass have a larger central temperature , so that a larger fractional region of the stellar core reaches @xmath10c burning temperatures . as a result ,",
    "massive stars contain a higher fraction of nitrogen in their core .      as a star leaves the main sequence and starts to ascend the giant branch , its core contracts and the base of its convective envelope extends deeper into the star , to reach zones enriched in cno - processed elements @xcite .",
    "this event , called the _ first dredge - up _ , results in a sharp change of surface abundances as the stellar surface becomes mixed with material enriched in nitrogen and depleted in carbon .    figure [ fig : selection ] illustrates the change of surface [ c / n ] for stars ascending the giant branch : we show a sample of stars from apogee dr12 in the log @xmath0 vs. @xmath1plane , colour - coded by their measured surface [ c / n ] .",
    "stars at the very bottom of the rgb have a high [ c / n ] ratio , and this ratio quickly decreases for stars higher up on the rgb : the transition from one regime to the other corresponds to the first dredge - up .",
    "this figure also shows that the dredge - up happens within a similar range of log @xmath0 in the apogee data and in the stellar evolution models of @xcite .",
    "another way to visualize the effect of the first dredge - up is to compare [ ( c+n)/m ] and [ c / n ] of stars before and after the dredge - up , as done in figure [ fig : comp_nodredgeup ] . following the dredge - up , the surface abundance of [ ( c+n)/m ] is unchanged because the total number of c , n , and o atoms is conserved ( and the abundance of oxygen is only slightly affected by the dredge - up ) , but the ratio [ c / n ] clearly decreases .    in canonical stellar evolution models , after the first dredge - up",
    "the surface abundances do not change any more until the agb phase . however",
    ", observational data show that this is not the case : the carbon isotopic ratio and the abundance of carbon further decrease ( and nitrogen increases ) as stars climb the rgb @xcite .",
    "these observations require non - canonical mixing mechanisms to move cno - processed material from the hydrogen - burning shell into the convective envelope .",
    "possible sources of deep mixing could be rotation @xcite or thermohaline instabilities @xcite , although the importance of this process is debated @xcite .    in any case , this additional mixing",
    "is only experienced by stars that go through an extended rgb evolution : this is the case of low mass stars ( below @xmath322.2 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "indeed , at the end of the main sequence , these low mass stars have an electron degenerate core and this core slowly grows in mass along the the rgb until it reaches a critical mass of 0.48  m@xmath2 , at what point helium burning is ignited .",
    "this event , the helium - core flash , marks the tip of the rgb . as mass loss increases rapidly as stars ascend the rgb , stars reaching the rgb - tip will experience the loss of a large fraction of their envelopes .",
    "after this , low - mass stars join the red clump .",
    "stars that are more massive than @xmath322.2 m@xmath2only go through the first dredge - up without any further mixing processes or mass loss because their rgb evolution is very short .",
    "indeed , these stars are massive enough to have a non - degenerate core and to ignite helium gently ; once this is done they populate the secondary red clump @xcite .       in the apokasc sample .",
    "the top panel compares the apokasc stars ( grey dots , here limited to @xmath13<0.1 $ ] ) to stellar evolution models of @xcite in red and @xcite in blue ( we show the `` standard '' models only including the first dredge - up ) . for the data and the models to match ,",
    "the observed [ c / n ] has to be increased by 0.2 : this reflects calibration issues for c and n abundances in apogee dr12 .",
    "models and data all show a decrease of [ c / n ] with increasing stellar mass , although models do not agree on the magnitude of the predicted decrease .",
    "the bottom panel compares the mean mass as a function of [ c / n ] for apokasc stars on the upper and lower rgb : in the presence of extra - mixing processes along the rgb , stars on the upper rgb would be expected to have a lower [ c / n ] at fixed stellar mass , but there is no evidence for this in the current data.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the surface abundances of a star after the first dredge - up depend both on the distribution of cno - processed material within the core at the end of the main sequence , and on the depth reached by the base of the convective envelope during the dredge - up .",
    "both of these aspects depend on the mass of the star : stars of increasing mass contain a higher fraction of nitrogen in their core , and have a convective zone that extends much deeper .",
    "metallicity , helium fraction and abundance in @xmath4 elements also influence the depth reached by the envelope because they impact its opacity @xcite , but these are only minor effects for stars below 3 m@xmath2@xcite .    as a result , after the first dredge - up , the surface of higher mass stars is comparatively richer in n and poorer in c with respect to lower mass stars .",
    "as an example , we show in figure [ fig : dredgeup ] the relationship between mass and the [ c / n ] ratio after the first dredge - up in the models of @xcite as well as models computed with the garching stellar evolution code ( garstec , @xcite ) for stars of solar metallicity : there is a decrease of [ c / n ] with increasing stellar mass .",
    "this figure also compares the models with observed mass and [ c / n ] from our apokasc sample ( see section [ sec : sample ] for explanations of how these quantities are derived ) : data and model predictions are roughly in agreement .",
    "there are however variations between models .",
    "this , together with potential calibration issues of abundances in apogee ( in figure [ fig : dredgeup ] , we have to shift the observed [ c / n ] by 0.2 dex to match model predictions ) , makes it difficult to directly use model predictions to translate an observed [ c / n ] into mass or into age , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "another potential hurdle in the use of [ c / n ] to determine stellar masses is that the relation between abundances and mass might depend on stellar evolutionary phase , as we discussed in the previous section .",
    "stars in the upper rgb would both undergo extra mixing and mass loss compared to stars on the lower rgb .",
    "stars in the red clump would have the largest mass loss , while stars in the secondary clump would have no extra mixing and no mass loss , and should be similar to stars on the lower rgb .",
    "we do not have a sample of massive stars on the lower rgb to compare to our secondary clump stars , but we can compare the mass and surface [ c / n ] of stars on the lower and upper rgb ( lower panel in figure [ fig : dredgeup ] ) . in the apokasc sample , we find no significant evidence for a different relation between mass and [ c / n ] in the upper and lower rgb .",
    "this is slightly unexpected , but could reflect the lower sensitivity to extra mixing of [ c / n ] compared to @xmath10c/@xmath11c ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the inefficiency of extra mixing processes at the relatively high metallicities of our sample @xcite .",
    "because of these uncertainties , in this paper , we decide not to rely on theoretical models to connect the masses of giant stars to the abundance of carbon and nitrogen at their surface .",
    "instead , we explore this correlation empirically using the apokasc sample .",
    "the apokasc project is the spectroscopic follow - up by apogee ( @xcite , as part of the third phase of the sloan digital sky survey , sdss - iii ; @xcite ) of stars with asteroseismology data from the _ kepler _ asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc ) .",
    "the first version of the apokasc catalogue @xcite contains seismic and spectroscopic measurements for 1,989 giants , with the spectroscopic information corresponding to apogee s data release 10 ( dr10 ; @xcite ) . in this present work ,",
    "we keep the same original sample of 1,989 stars and their seismic parameters , but update their @xmath1and abundances to dr12 values @xcite .",
    "this follows the same procedure as in @xcite .",
    "the 1,989 giants have been observed by _",
    "kepler _ over a total of 34 months ( q0q12 ) in long cadence mode , i.e. , with a 30 minute interval ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the raw light curves were prepared as described in @xcite , and the seismic parameters @xmath7and @xmath6were then measured using five different techniques @xcite .",
    "the final values of @xmath7and @xmath6given in the apokasc catalogue correspond to the ones obtained with the oct method from @xcite .",
    "the other four techniques are only used in an outlier rejection process ( stars with @xmath7values that differ significantly from one technique to another are removed from the sample ) and to estimate systematic uncertainties on the measured parameters .",
    "apogee is a high - resolution ( @xmath14 ) _ h_-band stellar survey which uses a multi - fiber spectrograph attached to the 2.5 m sdss telescope @xcite .",
    "the raw spectra are first processed by the apogee data reduction pipeline , as described in @xcite .",
    "stellar parameters are then derived with the apogee stellar parameter and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ; @xcite , garca prez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "aspcap compares the observed spectra to a large grid of synthetic spectra @xcite to determine the associated main stellar parameters .",
    "this synthetic grid has six dimensions : @xmath1 , log @xmath0 , metallicity [ m / h ] , as well as enhancement in @xmath4-elements [ @xmath4/m ] , in carbon [ c / m ] and in nitrogen [ n / m ] .",
    "a @xmath15 optimization finds the best fit spectrum , and the corresponding stellar parameters are assigned to the observed star .",
    "in addition to these parameters , dr12 also provides calibrated abundances for some elements as well as post - calibrated values of @xmath1and log @xmath0 by using literature studies of well - known star clusters , and the apokasc catalogue as reference for log @xmath0 . in this present work",
    "however , we always use the _ raw _ values to ensure that they are all self - consistent . in practice",
    ", this means that we use the values from the fparam array in dr12 .",
    "finally , the aspcap pipeline also returns uncertainties on stellar parameters and abundances .",
    "it seems however that the formal errors from the 6d fits to the spectra underestimate the true uncertainties on the stellar parameters : globular and open clusters are expected to be chemically homogeneous but the spread in chemical abundances for stars within a given cluster is larger than the formal errors @xcite .",
    "a corrected ( empirical ) estimate of the uncertainties is then provided by measuring the spread of abundances within star clusters .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure does not work for [ c / m ] and [ n / m ] because giant stars in clusters are expected to have an intrinsic spread in [ c / m ] and [ n / m ] .",
    "thus , while dr12 provides uncertainties for [ c / m ] and [ n / m ] ( with mean values of 0.04 and 0.07 dex respectively ) , these values are probably underestimated . a further analysis by @xcite shows that the precision on [ c / n ] is still probably better than 0.1 dex .",
    "the abundances of carbon and nitrogen are mainly measured from molecular lines of co and cn . because these lines become very weak for hot stars at low metallicity , the minimum abundance of [ c / m ] that can be measured depends on @xmath1and [ m / h ] ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "we want to eliminate from our sample stars with only an upper limit measurement on [ c / m ] ( and a lower limit on [ n / m ] ) , as such measurements may introduce a bias in our analysis if left in the sample .",
    "thus , following @xcite we remove from our sample selection stars with a raw @xmath1greater than 4550 k if -1@xmath16[m / h ] @xmath16 - 0.5 .    for stars with [ m / h ] @xmath17 - 0.5",
    ", we performed our own upper limit tests by selecting stars that have @xmath1greater than 4550 k and [ c / m]@xmath16 - 0.1 .",
    "we performed our own @xmath15 search using autosynth @xcite to fit individual co lines in the apogee windows from [ c / m]=-0.4 to + 0.7 . by inspecting the @xmath15 as a function of [ c / m ] we found that the minimum [ c / m ] possible to measure is on the level of -0.4 to -0.5  dex , far smaller than the most carbon poor star found in our sample .",
    "thus , it was determined that no temperature cut is necessary near solar metallicity and below 5000  k.    even for stars with `` good '' measurements , there is a zero - point issue with the absolute [ n / m ] values : they are @xmath18 dex too low compared to literature values as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this systematic offset does not impact this study .",
    "however , such offsets also mean the results of our fits can not be blindly applied to another survey , or even to another data release of apogee : the abundances would first need to be put on the same scale , for instance using _ the cannon _ @xcite .      our goal is to learn an empirical relation between c , n abundances and stellar parameters .",
    "therefore , we need a reliable sample of stars . starting from the apokasc ",
    "dr12 giant stars sample , we first eliminate stars for which any of the aspcap flags are set to warning or bad ( this signals potential problems with the determination of spectroscopic parameters ) , as well as stars for which the spectra have a signal - to - noise ratio below 100 .",
    "we also tried other quality cuts using the @xmath15 value of the aspcap best fit to the spectra , and using the number of times a given star was observed , but none of those impacted our results .    to ensure the good quality of the seismic masses we derive , we remove stars with relative uncertainties on @xmath6and @xmath7greater than 5% , and the most metal poor stars ( [ m / h ] @xmath19 ) , for which the standard seismic scaling relations might be less accurate @xcite . finally , we exclude the fast rotating stars ( 14 rapid and 12 additional anomalous rotators ) identified by @xcite .",
    "such stars might be accreting mass from a companion , so that their surface properties might not correspond to their mass and evolutionary stage .",
    "out of the 1,989 stars with seismic and spectroscopic information , 1,475 stars remain ; these objects form the sample used in this paper .",
    "is derived from from the apogee spectra .",

    "this ensures that @xmath1is closer to the `` true '' physical scale .",
    "we derive the mass uncertainty from the uncertainties on @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 , which have average values of 3.1% , 2.4% and 1.9% , respectively ; this leads to an average mass uncertainty of 0.2 m@xmath2(or 14% ) .    while scaling relations have been widely used to determine stellar masses , small deviations to the @xmath6scaling relation",
    "have been proposed , both based on studies of stellar models and on the determination of masses for stars in open clusters .",
    "@xcite use stellar models to show that the relation between @xmath6and stellar density matches the standard relation for solar type stars on the main sequence , but that deviations of the order of 2% in the relation between @xmath6and @xmath29 exist for stars on the giant branch .",
    "this translates into a mass 8% smaller than predicted by the scaling relations .",
    "@xcite find a similar offset when comparing the mass of the red giant kepler-56 obtained from the scaling relations to the mass obtained from an analysis of the individual seismic frequencies .",
    "it seems also that deviations to the standard relations are different for red clump ( rc ) and rgb stars .",
    "this is not unexpected , because these two types of stars have very different internal structures , hence different temperature and sound speed profiles .",
    "@xcite studied the mass of stars in open clusters and found an offset between the mass of rc and rgb stars that can not be explained by mass loss alone .",
    "further models by @xcite also suggest a different offset in the @xmath6scaling relation for rc and rgb stars ( in the sense that rc masses are underestimated and rgb masses are overestimated by the standard relation ) .    to apply modifications to the scaling relation to our sample of stars , we first need to identify rc and rgb stars .",
    "while some of the stars in the apokasc catalogue have such a label ( clump or rgb in the catalogue ) , it is not the case for all stars .",
    "we classify stars as rc stars if they are identified as such by their seismic properties , or if they were identified as being in the rc region of the h ",
    "r diagram by @xcite , or if @xmath30 .",
    "all other stars are identified as rgb stars .",
    "for all stars identified as rgbs following these criteria , we reduce the mass by 8% , while we leave the mass of rc stars as predicted by the scaling relations .",
    "figure [ fig : hrmass ] shows the distribution of our sample in the surface gravity versus @xmath1plane , with stars colour - coded by their mass .",
    "stars in the red clump show a correlation between mass and log @xmath0 , with the most massive stars being located in the secondary clump at log @xmath0 slightly below 3 .      in principle ,",
    "ages of giant stars can be derived by fitting isochrones to the location of stars in the hr diagram . however , as discussed in @xcite , the location of the rgb is quite uncertain in stellar evolution models , and uncertainties on the measurements of @xmath1exacerbate the problem .",
    "we thus choose a simple way to translate mass into age based on the stars age as a function of stellar mass for different phases of stellar evolution ( at the bottom of the rgb , in the rc , and at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch  agb ) .",
    "for a given metallicity , we use the relation between mass and age as given by the parsec isochrones @xcite using a mass loss parameter @xmath31 .",
    "although the mass loss parameter is an uncertain quantity , such a relatively low value is favoured by the study of @xcite .",
    "we use a set of isochrones regularly spaced by log(age / yr)=0.015 from 100 myr to 13 gyr , and ranging from [ m / h]=-1 to 0.5 in bins of 0.1 . for each star",
    ", we use the set of isochrones closest to its metallicity ( without interpolating between sets of different metallicity ) .    for rc stars ( as defined in the previous section ) , we use the relation between mass and age in the rc .",
    "ten stars have a mass too small to be consistent with the isochrones we use : either their measured stellar mass is too low ( from measurement errors , or because the scaling relations should be modified also for the rc stars ) , or they have lost more mass than prescribed by our chosen set of isochrones .",
    "we attribute an age of 13 gyr to these stars .",
    "for the rest of the stars , we use the relation between mass and age at the bottom of the rgb .",
    "32 stars have a too low mass to be consistent with isochrones . for the stars with log(g)@xmath32 we use the relation between mass and age at the tip of the agb , for stars with log(g ) between 2 and 2.7",
    ", we use the relation for rc stars . stars that can not be attributed an age in any of these ways",
    "are given an age of 13 gyr .",
    "for each star we estimate an age uncertainty by translating into age the upper and lower limit of our mass uncertainty range following the procedure we have just described .",
    "as a sanity check , we show in figure [ fig : alpha_mass ] the relation between [ @xmath4/m ] , [ m / h ] and mass ( left column , top row ) or age ( left column , bottom row ) for the 1475 giants we have selected from the apokasc sample .",
    "this figure shows that , as expected from previous studies and from chemical evolution models , the @xmath4-rich sequence mostly contains low - mass , old stars . as [ @xmath4/m]decreases ,",
    "stars become more massive and younger . to investigate the scatter in age within a bin of [ @xmath4/m]and [ m / h ]",
    ", we first group bins together using a voronoi binning algorithm @xcite so that each new bin now contains 8 stars on average . within each of the new voronoi bins",
    ", we then compute the median mass and age for all stars in that bin .",
    "if we compare the values of mass and age for each star to the median mass and age of stars in the same voronoi bin , we find a median scatter in mass of 9 per cent , and a median age scatter of 26 per cent .",
    "as we mentioned in section [ sec : cnocycles ] , stellar evolution models predict a correlation between mass , carbon and nitrogen abundances .",
    "this correlation arises from internal evolution of the stars , hence from a different origin than the [ @xmath4/m]and mass correlation .",
    "indeed , the latter does not reflect the stellar evolution but the composition of the material from which stars are born .    in the right column of figure",
    "[ fig : alpha_mass ] , we show the relation between [ c / n ] , [ m / h ] and mass or age for the apokasc giants . for a given metallicity",
    ", a low [ c / n ] ratio corresponds to a high stellar mass and a small age .",
    "similarly as in figure [ fig : dredgeup ] , the magnitude of the decrease of [ c / n ] with stellar mass is consistent with stellar evolution models .",
    "we build voronoi bins in the same way as in the [ @xmath4/m][m / h ] plane , and then compare the values of mass and age for each star to the median mass and age of stars in the same voronoi bin . the median scatter in mass",
    "is 9 per cent , and the median age scatter is 25 per cent .",
    "this is similar to the age and mass scatter in the [ @xmath4/m][m / h ] plane .",
    "figure [ fig : feh_cm_nm ] demonstrates that the correlation between mass and [ c / n ] arises both from a decrease of [ c / m ] with mass and an increase of [ n / m ] with mass : both elements contain mass information , as predicted by stellar evolution models .",
    "we want to generate a model that can predict masses and/or ages from a set of spectroscopic observables .",
    "we start with only considering element abundances , namely [ m / h ] , [ c / m ] , and [ n / m ] .",
    "the set of abundances could be larger , but in this present work , we want to stay close to the stellar evolution physics detailed above .",
    "therefore , we explore the construction of such predictive model with a minimum number of chemical elements .",
    "our model is relatively simple .",
    "we define it from a polynomial combination of the different features ( e.g. , chemical elements ) , which also includes cross - terms between the different dimensions .",
    "this allows us to effectively expand our dataset to non - linear combinations of our initial dimensions .",
    "more specifically , we denote the coefficient in front of the @xmath33-th label @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "then , the predicted value @xmath36 ( i.e. , age or mass ) is given by : @xmath37 which we can write with vectors as @xmath38    this corresponds to a simple linear regression ( linear in the parameters , @xmath39 ) , in which @xmath40 is a constant allowing us to account for a non - zero offset in this relation .",
    "the training data is provided in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "we estimate the internal uncertainties on the fit parameters and on the predicted values by drawing 100 fiducial samples from the data ( assuming gaussian errors on both the input labels and on masses or ages ) , and performing a set of 100 linear regressions , giving 100 different realizations of both the model and the predicted mass or age .",
    "we use the standard deviation of these 100 different predicted masses for each star as an estimator of the mass internal uncertainty in the model .",
    "we also validate our model through cross - validation .",
    "this is a way to test how well our model would apply to other datasets , and to give a better estimate of the model performance and external errors .",
    "we use a leave - one - out cross - validation ( loocv ) algorithm : for a set of @xmath41 stars , this consists of training the model on @xmath42 stars , and testing the performance on the last star , i.e. , measuring the error the model makes when predicting parameters of that particular star .",
    "this step is repeated @xmath41 times , once per star from the training dataset .",
    "we first apply the method described in the previous section to fit for mass as a function of [ m / h ] , [ c / m ] , [ n / m ] , and [ ( c+n)/m ] .",
    "we add [ ( c+n)/m ] in the fit because stellar models predict this remains constant during the dredge - up and is thus characteristic of the birth composition of a star .",
    "the coefficients we obtain for the fitting function are provided in table [ tab : coef_mass1 ] in appendix [ appendix_fit ] .",
    "the mass uncertainty for each star ( obtained from 100 different realizations of the model as explained in the previous section ) is of 0.02 m@xmath2on average .",
    "this uncertainty is much smaller than the r.m.s error returned by the cross - validation , which is 0.26 m@xmath2 , or 18 per cent in fractional error .",
    "this means that the individual mass internal uncertainties are meaningless , and that the error budget is dominated by systematic errors ( either an inappropriate model , or biases in the data itself ) .    the left panel of figure [ fig : fit_mass ] shows the predicted mass as a function of true mass for the stars in our apokasc training set , and the relative mass error as a function of the true mass .",
    "the dashed lines represent the mean and 1-@xmath43 scatter around the mean in both cases .",
    "the simple fit that we have used performs relatively well for most stars with a mass between 1 and 1.5 m@xmath2but tends to over - predict the mass of low mass stars , and significantly under - predict the mass of massive stars .",
    "an important aspect to check is if the way we derived the masses themselves could be the source of that bias .",
    "there are indeed different ways to determine masses from the seismic parameters : the direct method ( used here ) , and the grid - based method that relies on comparing observed stellar parameters with theoretical isochrones . for the apokasc sample ,",
    "both ways of determining masses give similar results , except at very low and very high masses ( figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this could explain part of the bias we find .",
    "however , we have tried to fit for the grid - based masses , and find the same bias to be present and extremely similar .    to explore further the origin of the bias ,",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : fit_residuals ] shows the individual relative mass error as a function of @xmath1and log @xmath0 . while the values of the relative errors are small on average , they show some significant structure in the h ",
    "r diagram .",
    "in particular , the mass of secondary clump stars is systematically under - predicted : these are the stars with a mass of @xmath44 m@xmath2 , that also appeared as problematic stars in figure [ fig : fit_mass ]",
    ".    these massive stars might be outliers in our fits because they actually may not follow the same relation between [ c / n ] and mass as the rest of the sample . as described in section",
    "[ sec : cnocycles ] , massive stars only experience a short rgb phase and do not undergo extra mixing after the first dredge - up .",
    "they also do not go through the helium flash at the tip of the rgb @xcite , they do not shed their envelope away and do not lose as much mass as lower mass stars during this instability phase .",
    "these reasons could explain why the mapping of [ c / n ] to mass could differ for massive stars .    to improve our model",
    ", one possibility would be to gather a larger training set , on which we could use more flexible fitting procedures .",
    "this is left for future work , as an extended version of the apokasc sample will be released soon . in the meantime",
    ", we try to improve our fit by adding more stellar labels measured by the apogee pipeline ."
