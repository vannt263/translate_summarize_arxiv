    "we consider a largely ignored metric which belongs to a class of vacuum solutions referred to as degenerate solutions of class a @xcite given by @xmath0 which are axisymmetric solutions , but where the usual 2-dimensional spheres are replaced by pseudo - spheres , @xmath1 , i.e. , by surfaces of negative , constant curvature . these are still surfaces of revolution around an axis , and @xmath2 represents the corresponding rotation angle . for the vacuum case",
    "we get @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "we immediately see that the static solution holds for @xmath5 and that there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath6 ( note that @xmath7 neither vanishes nor becomes @xmath8 at @xmath6)@xcite .",
    "this is the complementary domain of the exterior schwarzschild solution . in the region @xmath9 , as in the latter solution , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 metric coefficients swap signs . defining @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", we obtain @xmath14 with the following parametric definitions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which is a particular case of a bianchi iii axisymetric universe .",
    "using pseudo - spherical coordinates @xmath18 , the spatial part of the metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) can be related to the hyperboloid @xmath19 embedded in a 4-dimensional flat space .",
    "we then have @xmath20\\,{\\rm d}r^2 + r^2 \\left ( { \\rm d}u^2+\\sinh^2u\\ , { \\rm d}v^2 \\right ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] where the prime stands for differentiation with respect to @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we can recast metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) into the following @xmath23 \\,{\\rm d}\\tau^2 +   \\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\bar r}\\right)^2\\ ,   \\cos ^4\\left[\\ln\\left ( \\bar r\\right)^{\\mp 1}\\right]\\ , \\left[{\\rm d}\\bar{r}^2\\,+ \\bar r^2\\,({\\rm d}u^2 + \\sinh^2{u}\\,{\\rm d}v^2 ) \\right]\\ ; , \\label{isotrop3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the analogue of the isotropic form of the schwarzschild solution",
    ". the spatial surfaces are conformally flat , but the flat metric is not euclidean .",
    "indeed , the 3dim spatial metric @xmath24 is foliated by 2-dimensional surfaces of negative curvature , since @xmath25 , and it corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "we thus can not recover the usual newtonian weak - field limit .",
    "analysing the `` radial '' motion of test particles , we have the following equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants of motion defined by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for fixed @xmath32 .",
    "the former and latter constants represent the energy and angular momentum per unit mass , respectively .",
    "we thus define the potential @xmath33 this potential is manifestly repulsive , crosses the @xmath21-axis at @xmath6 , and for sufficiently high values of @xmath29 it has a minimum at @xmath34 .",
    "however this minimum falls outside the @xmath6 divide .",
    "so a test particle is subject to a repulsive potential forcing it to inevitably cross the event horizon at @xmath6 attracted either by some mass at the minimum or by masses at infinity . in it",
    "is hinted that the non - existence of a clear newtonian analogue is related to the existence of mass sources at @xmath8 , but no definite conclusions were drawn .",
    "a natural extension of the solution ( [ metric_constnc - antiscwarz ] ) would be to add exotic matter to obtain static and pseudo - spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions @xcite .",
    "consider the metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] . the coordinate @xmath21 decreases from a constant value @xmath4 to a minimum value @xmath37 , representing the location of the throat of the wormhole , where @xmath38 , and then it increases from @xmath37 back to the value @xmath4 . the condition @xmath39 imposes that @xmath40 , contrary to the morris - thorne counterpart @xcite .",
    "the solution provides the following stress - energy scenario @xmath41 \\label{radialpwh}\\,,\\\\ p_t(r)&=&\\frac{1}{8\\pi } \\left(\\frac{b}{r}-1\\right)\\bigg[\\phi ' ' + ( \\phi')^2 + \\frac{b'r+b - r}{2r(b - r)}\\phi '   + \\frac{b'r - b}{2r^2(b - r ) } \\bigg ] \\label{lateralpwh}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath42 is the energy density , @xmath43 is the radial pressure , @xmath44 is the pressure measured in the tangential directions .",
    "note that the radial pressure is always positive at the throat , i.e , @xmath45 , contrary to the morris - thorne wormhole , where a radial tension at the throat is needed to sustain the wormhole .",
    "in addition to this , the mathematics of embedding imposes that @xmath46 at the throat , which implies a negative energy density at the throat ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this condition is another significant difference to the morris - thorne wormhole , where the existence of negative energy densities at the throat is not a necessary condition .",
    "several interesting equations of state were considered in @xcite , and we refer the reader to this work for more details .",
    "a theorem by buchdahl @xcite establishes the reciprocity between any static solution of einstein s vacuum field equations and a one - parameter family of solutions of einstein s equations with a ( massless ) scalar field . in the conformally transformed einstein frame , note that scalar - tensor gravity theories are described by @xmath47 + \\left ( 16\\pi g_n/\\phi^{-2}(\\varphi)\\right)\\ , l_{matter}\\right ] \\label{e_st_action } $ ] . in this representation",
    "we have gr plus a massles scalar field which is now coupled to the matter fields .",
    "different scalar - tensor theories correspond to different couplings . in the absence of matter",
    "we can use buchdahl s theorem .",
    "so , given the metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) , we derive the corresponding scalar - tensor solution @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this clearly reduces to our anti - schwarzschild metric ( [ metric_constnc ] ) in the gr limit when @xmath51 , and hence @xmath52 implying that @xmath53 is constant . reverting @xmath54 , and the conformal transformation , @xmath55 , we can recast this solution in the original frame in which the scalar - field is coupled to the geometry and the content is vacuum , the so - called jordan frame .",
    "the @xmath6 limit is no longer just a coordinate singularity , but rather a true singularity as it can be verified from the analysis of the curvature invariants . in the einstein frame",
    "this occurs because the energy density of the scalar field diverges likewise in the schwarzschild case@xcite . of paramount importance",
    "is that , once again , the st - solution has no newtonian limit ( as its gr limit does not have one ) .",
    "this implies that the usual parametrized post - newtonian formalism that assesses the departures of modified gravity theories from gr does not hold for this class of metrics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have outlined the exotic features of the vacuum static solution with a pseudo - spherical foliation of space .",
    "we have revealed the existence of generalised wormholes , and derived its extension to scalar - tensor gravity theories .",
    "a fundamental feature of these solutions is the absence of a newtonian weak field limit , which reminds us of a quotation from john barrow  @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the miracle of general relativity is that a purely mathematical assembly of second - rank tensors should have anything to do with newtonian gravity in any limit_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the authors are grateful to raul vera and guillermo a. gonzlez for helpful discussions .",
