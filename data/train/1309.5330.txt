    "sustaining large , reliable magnetic fields is a major requirement across a broad range of applications in cold atom experiments , including zeeman slowers@xcite , magnetic traps@xcite , magnetic conveyor belts@xcite and feshbach control@xcite .",
    "all of these applications typically require magnetic fields on the order of 1,000 g or higher .",
    "the need to reach high fields has led to substantial evolution and innovation in the design of electromagnets for both resistive magnets and those based on superconducting elements@xcite .",
    "in contrast to superconducting magnets , resistive magnets allow fast field control for the experiment , but exhibit significant heat dissipation ; heat removal is of critical importance in the optimization of magnet design@xcite .",
    "most electromagnets used in cold atom experiments are constructed out of copper wire or refrigeration tubing@xcite wound into cylinders .",
    "these designs are easy to manufacture and can easily fit around a vacuum component .",
    "there are many drawbacks to these designs , however .",
    "electrical power is dissipated into cooling water that flows in series with the current , leading to a large temperature gradient in the device , a high resistance to cooling water , and significant differences in temperature between the water supply and return .",
    "furthermore , construction of conventional coils requires a significant amount of epoxy , which can degrade over time , and the coil can not be easily modified .",
    "finally , simple wire - wound electromagnets produce weaker magnetic fields by comparison to more advanced designs .",
    "copper arcs ( red ) plus one brass arc ( gold ) as an end cap .",
    "( b ) the current ( red arrows ) flows through the copper arcs ( red ) in a helical pattern through the device .",
    "the cooling water ( blue arrows ) flows parallel to the current through the device in channels cut into the polyester insulators ( grey ) . for simplicity , we only show two copper arcs .",
    "the actual electromagnet contains @xmath9 copper arcs .",
    "]    recent investigations by ricci _",
    "et al _ into electromagnet designs for cold atom experiments have focused on improved liquid cooling efficiency by introducing parallel cooling channels@xcite .",
    "the device supports current higher than that allowable in conventional designs ; at @xmath10 a the device runs at @xmath11 @xmath8c .",
    "another modified version of the wire - wound electromagnet design with a parallel cooling water channel within the coil has demonstrated significant improvement to the heat removal ; this device reaches a field of @xmath12 g while dissipating @xmath13 kw .    here",
    "we present a modified design for large bore bitter type electromagnets to suit cold atom experiment , made watertight without epoxy .",
    "each electromagnet delivers @xmath1 g while dissipating @xmath14 kw with modest machining and cooling requirements .",
    "the surface area of copper in contact with cooling water compared to the volume of copper is superior to copper wire and refrigeration tubing designs .",
    "a flow rate of @xmath5 @xmath6/min is obtained from a typical laboratory supply ( @xmath15 psi or @xmath16 kpa ) , which keeps the heating of the electromagnet to a mere @xmath7 @xmath8c , and a factor of up to @xmath17 times less heating than traditional and modern electromagnet designs .",
    "the design is suitable for high field tuning of feshbach resonances@xcite , zeeman slowing@xcite and evaporation@xcite in cold atom experiments and related atomic physics applications .",
    "our design follows the classic bitter - type electromagnet @xcite , consisting of @xmath9 annular copper arcs and one annular brass arc , separated by insulating polyester spacers of the same shape . in each successive layer ,",
    "both copper and polyester layers are rotated by one - eighth of a turn to create a helical conduction path .",
    "the assembly is held together by seven steel screws and one brass screw bolted through a series of eight holes bored parallel to the coil axis .",
    "the brass screw serves to deliver electrical current to the annular brass arc and in turn to the first copper arc , furthest from the mount .",
    "the current returns through the last copper arc . in order to ensure a clear optical path ,",
    "the inner bore of the coil is significantly larger than more common bitter coil designs of similar size@xcite .",
    "the steel mount has threaded holes for optical mounts and mounting holes for attachment to our vacuum chamber .",
    "our electromagnets reside inside recesses surrounding the viewports of our vacuum chamber .",
    "two independent electromagnets on opposite sides of the vacuum chamber allow for either a nearly homogenous field in a parallel current configuration or a quadrupole field in an antiparallel current configuration .",
    "we deviate from the conventional bitter - type design by using eight bores to deliver and remove cooling water to a series of ducts with rectangular cross - sections across the copper surface .",
    "an advantage of this design geometry over the original bitter coil is that all electrical and cooling water feed throughs leave the device on the same side of the electromagnet instead of entering one side and exiting the other@xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "these water channels between copper layers are defined by removed material from the polyester spacers .",
    "the channels in the polyester spacers are rimmed with nitrile gaskets to ensure a watertight seal .",
    "a complete turn consists of a copper arc , a polyester spacer , a copper insert and five nitrile gaskets , see fig",
    ".  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "copper arcs are @xmath18 mm in thickness and the filling fraction of copper in a complete turn is @xmath19 .",
    "coil elements were machined using standard milling machines and machine lathes .",
    "copper arcs were formed from @xmath18 mm sheets of ultra - pure ( 99.99% ) ultra - conductive copper alloy @xmath20 , cut into @xmath21 mm squares , stacked and then clamped between two steel discs .",
    "arcs were machined to the described form as a single stack .",
    "the mount and cooling water distribution elements were constructed from steel alloy @xmath22 and polycarbonate , respectively .",
    "the steel mount provides a rigid seat for the steel clamping screws .",
    "nitrile gaskets and polyester insulators were cut with a co@xmath23 laser cutter ( universal vls4.60 ) .",
    "the entire device is sealed by physical compression to greater than @xmath15 psi above atmosphere without chemical sealants .",
    "the steel screws have acetal washers to prevent shorts to the annular brass arc ; this isolates the whole steel mount from the coil with a measured resistivity over @xmath24 k@xmath25 .",
    "a schematic of the electromagnet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and a picture of the coil is shown in its test scaffolding in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_1 ] .",
    "it is useful to know how cooling water flows through the channels .",
    "the cross section of the rectangular ducts is @xmath26 mm@xmath27 where @xmath28 mm is the height and @xmath29 mm is the width .",
    "each channel length @xmath30 is about @xmath31 mm .",
    "each insulator has three channels and the insulator between the last copper arc and the polycarbonate cooling block has four channels .",
    "this gives our design a total of @xmath32 channels with a total flow of @xmath5 @xmath6/min , making the average velocity of cooling water in a channel @xmath33 m / s .",
    "the channel height is less than the laminar boundary layer of fluid flow over a flat plate characterized by the displacement thickness@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 m@xmath27/s is the kinematic viscosity for water .",
    "the reynolds number , @xmath36 , for the case of a wide rectangular duct is @xmath37 where @xmath38 m@xmath39/s is the volumetric flow rate of @xmath40 @xmath6/min of cooling water and @xmath41 mm is the hydraulic diameter for our rectangular ducts . for a reynolds number of @xmath42",
    "the flow would be turbulent@xcite , implying that the flow along the length of the cooling channels is in the laminar flow regime .",
    "laminar flow induces less vibrational noise . to match",
    "the cooling water flow of our bitter electromagnets , refrigeration tubing and flat wire designs would need to run at very high water pressure on the order of @xmath43 psi or @xmath44 mpa , which is inconvenient and hazardous .",
    "further , our use of parallel cooling channels and the fact that flow conductance for this design increases roughly in proportion to the total number of turns results in a highly scalable design . with copper tubing wound into a cylindrical electromagnet , increasing the number of turns would cause a proportional increase in the hydrodynamic impedance .",
    "we investigate two ways to characterize the thermal characteristics of the electromagnet .",
    "each cooling channel touches two copper arcs which leads to a large surface area of copper in contact with cooling water .",
    "the ratio of the surface area of copper in contact with cooling water to the volume of copper for the electromagnet is @xmath45 which suggests that dissipated heat in the coil can be efficiently removed within an average propagation distance of merely @xmath46 mm .",
    "we can further characterize the efficiency to remove heat by the nusselt number , @xmath47 . for laminar flow in a duct with a rectangular cross - section we obtain@xcite",
    "@xmath48 the nusselt number parameterizes the dominance of convective over conductive flow .",
    "a nusselt number of @xmath49 to @xmath50 corresponds to heat removal by convective flow , implying the heat removal of our device comes mostly from conductive flow .",
    "( a )     + ( b )    in order to obtain an operational profile for the coils , we use the setup shown in fig .  [ fig:3_2 ] .",
    "we measure the magnetic field , the resistance , the inductance and thermal characteristics .",
    "magnetic field measurements and thermal characteristics were obtained together during electrical stress tests .",
    "the resistance and inductance were measured separately .",
    "( a )     + ( b )    to experimentally investigate the external magnetic field , we increased the current from @xmath51 a to @xmath3 a in @xmath52 a intervals over @xmath53 minutes .",
    "this allowed us to monitor the temperature in order to determine stability of the operating mode .",
    "the axial magnetic field @xmath2 mm away from the end cap of the coil was found to be @xmath54 g / a , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4_1 ] .",
    "application of @xmath3 amps would produce a peak field of @xmath55 g for a pair of coils separated by @xmath56 mm .",
    "to predict the field , we start with the averaged current density @xmath57 of a bitter electromagnet , given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the radial position , @xmath60 mm is the inner radius of the electromagnet , @xmath61 mm is the outer radius , @xmath62 is the copper filling factor and @xmath63 is the applied current .",
    "the @xmath64 current distribution results from the cylindrical geometry of the electromagnets .",
    "the magnetic field generated by a single copper arc along the axial direction can be expressed as@xcite @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 h / m is the magnetic permeability and @xmath67 is the position from the center of the arc .",
    "this equation predicts that we should output @xmath68 g / a for our electromagnet which agrees well with our measurement of @xmath54 g / a .",
    "the electrical response of the bitter electromagnet is measured by the set up shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_2 ] .",
    "the resistance can be estimated by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of turns , @xmath71 mm is the thickness of a copper arc and @xmath72 @xmath25 m is the resistivity of copper .",
    "this equation predicts a resistance of @xmath73 m@xmath25 .",
    "this is in agreement with our measured value of @xmath74 m@xmath25 .",
    "we measure the impedance of the coil over a frequency range of @xmath75 hz to @xmath76 khz subjected to ac voltage at @xmath77 v peak to peak and extract the inductance @xmath78 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4_2 ] . for the inductance we obtained @xmath79 @xmath80h .",
    "the predicted bitter coil inductance is expressed by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the half height of the electromagnet and @xmath83 is the self - inductance factor which depends on the geometry .",
    "the dimensionless factor of self - inductance @xmath83 depends only on the current distribution and geometry of the electromagnet .",
    "this factor for our bitter electromagnets was found to be @xmath84 , compared to the typical bitter electromagnet with @xmath85 from literature@xcite .",
    "the calculated inductance of @xmath86 @xmath80h is in good agreement with our measurement of @xmath79 @xmath80h .",
    "our device exhibits an inductance at least two orders of magnitude below conventional designs .",
    "the bitter electromagnets can thus respond faster .     as we increase the current through the electromagnet .",
    "we perform this measurement for various flow rates to determine the dependance of coil temperature on the flow rate .",
    "inset : dependence of thermal resistance @xmath87 on the inverse water flow rate @xmath88 . ]    to measure how the power dissipation varies with the water flow we took multiple electrical tests at three different flow rates .",
    "we observe a linear dependance of the coil temperature on the dissipated power .",
    "the change in temperature of the coil , @xmath89 , as a function of the flow rate @xmath90 and dissipating power @xmath91 is@xcite @xmath92 where @xmath87 is the absolute thermal resistance , the water heat capacity is @xmath93 j / kg c@xmath8 and density is @xmath94 g / cm@xmath39 .",
    "the thermal resistance @xmath96 of the tests ranges from @xmath77 @xmath8c / kw to @xmath17 @xmath8c / kw and depends inversely upon the flow rate @xmath90 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we found the slope of the thermal resistance versus the inverse flow rate to be @xmath97 @xmath8c cm@xmath39/w s which is in good agreement with the predicted value , @xmath98 @xmath8c cm@xmath39/w s. the thermal resistance of the device at a given water pressure is of particular merit ; during continuous use , for every kilowatt , the device only gains a few degrees celsius .",
    "conventional devices dissipate more power at comparable amperage and further exacerbate this difference through serial cooling schemes .",
    "both the thermal resistance and water resistance of our bitter electromagnet are very low .",
    "the predicted failure mode for continuous operation of a pair of symmetric coils is one in which the cooling water boils within the devices , which may force cracks to open in the seals .",
    "based on the above measurements , this mode is predicted to occur around a power dissipation of @xmath99 kw and a current of @xmath100 ka per coil with cooling water flowing at @xmath40 @xmath6/min . the peak magnetic field along the axis of symmetry of the two coils , when separated by @xmath101 mm , is @xmath102 g.    in summary , we describe a simple , scalable resistive bitter electromagnet design suitable for high - field cold atom experiments .",
    "our design provides stable temperatures close to the ambient during high field operation .",
    "our electromagnet significantly outperforms conventional electromagnets made of refrigeration tubing or flat wire due to high copper filling fraction and efficient heat removal .",
    "further , our modified bitter electromagnet exhibits an inductance at least two orders of magnitude below that of other electromagnet designs .",
    "modified elements from the original bitter electromagnet design include tapped holes for optics , all feedthroughs on one side of the device , and a large central bore for clear optical access , which are essential for cold atom experiments .",
    "this design requires basic machining skills and readily available materials to produce and scale up .",
