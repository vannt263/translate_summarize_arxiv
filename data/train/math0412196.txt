    "in this article we focus on local martingales , functions of two - dimensional processes , whose components are a continuous local martingale @xmath5 and its supremum @xmath6 , i.e. on local martingales of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "we call functions @xmath8 such that @xmath7 is a local martingale , @xmath2-harmonic functions",
    ".    some examples of such local martingales are @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , introduced by azma and yor @xcite .",
    "we show that ( [ eq : ffmart ] ) defines a local martingale for any borel , locally integrable function @xmath12 .",

    "we explain , in an intuitive manner , how these local martingales , which we call _ max - martingales _ , may be used to find the azma - yor solution to the skorokhod embedding problem .",
    "we then go on and develop , with the help of these martingales , the well - known bounds on the law of the supremum of a uniformly integrable martingale with a fixed terminal distribution . using the lvy and dambis - dubins - schwarz theorems , we reformulate the results in terms of the absolute value @xmath16 and the local time @xmath17 at @xmath3 , of the local martingale @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to some new bounds on the law of the local time of a uniformly integrable martingale with fixed terminal distribution .",
    "a recently introduced and studied stochastic order , called the excess wealth order ( see shaked and shanthikumar @xcite ) , plays a crucial role .",
    "we also point out that the max - martingales appear naturally in some brownian penalization problems .",
    "finally , we try to sketch a somewhat more general viewpoint linked with the balayage formula .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : discrete ] with a discrete version of the balayage formula and show how to deduce from it doob s maximal and @xmath18 inequalities . in the subsequent section [ sec : harm ] , in theorem [ thm : bharm ] ,",
    "we formulate the result about the harmonic functions of @xmath2 and prove it in a regular case .",
    "section [ sec : appl ] is devoted to some applications : it contains three subsections concentrating respectively on the skorokhod embedding problem , bounds on the laws of @xmath1 and @xmath17 , and brownian penalizations .",
    "the last section contains a discussion of the balayage formula .",
    "throughout this paper @xmath5 will denote a continuous local martingale , and @xmath19 .",
    "we have adopted this notation so that there is no confusion with stock - price processes , which are often denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the local time at @xmath3 of @xmath0 is denoted @xmath21 . for processes either in discrete or in continuous time , when we say that a process is a ( sub / super ) martingale without specifying the filtration , we mean the natural filtration of the process .",

    "we start with the discrete time setting , and present a simple idea , which corresponds to balayage in continuous time , and which proves an efficient tool , as it allows , for example , to obtain easily doob s maximal and @xmath18 inequalities .",

    "the following proposition is an extension of proposition 4.7 in revuz and yor @xcite .",

    "* remarks . * local martingales of the form ( [ eq : hgenmart ] ) were first introduced by azma and yor @xcite and used to solve the skorokhod embedding problem ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : skoro ] below ) . in the light of the above theorem , we will call them * max - martingales * and the functions given in ( [ eq : hgen ] ) will be called * mm - harmonic functions * ( max - martingale harmonic ) or @xmath2-harmonic .",
    "note the resemblance of ( [ eq : hgenmart ] ) with the discrete time process @xmath72 given in proposition [ prop : discmart ] . + it is known ( see proposition 4.7 in revuz and yor @xcite ) that if @xmath105 then the reverse statement holds .",
    "that is , if @xmath98 is @xmath2-harmonic then there exists a continuous function @xmath12 such that ( [ eq : hgen ] ) holds .",
    "we present below a proof of this fact .",
    "we conjecture that it suffices to suppose only that @xmath98 is right - continuous in the first coordinate .",

    "we assume that @xmath105 , with obvious notation , and that @xmath98 is @xmath96-harmonic .",
    "we denote by @xmath107 and @xmath108 the partial derivatives of @xmath98 in the first and the second argument respectively , and @xmath109 the second derivative of @xmath98 in the first argument . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath110 . under the present assumptions we can apply it s formula to obtain : @xmath111 where we used the fact that @xmath112 , @xmath113-a.s .",

    "thus , @xmath122 . this yields formula ( [ eq : hgen ] ) .    furthermore , the above reasoning grants us that the formula ( [ eq : hgenmart ] ) holds for @xmath12 of class @xmath123 . as @xmath123 is dense in the class of locally integrable functions ( in an appropriate norm ) , if we can show that the quantities given in ( [ eq : hgenmart ] ) are well defined and finite for any locally integrable @xmath12 on @xmath124 , then the formula ( [ eq : hgenmart ] ) extends to such functions through monotone class theorems . for @xmath12 a locally integrable function , @xmath125 is well defined and finite , so all we need to show is that @xmath126 is well defined and finite a.s .",

    "@xmath47    lvy s theorem guarantees that the processes @xmath137 and @xmath138 have the same distribution , where @xmath139 denotes local time at @xmath3 of @xmath24 .",

    "we now present some easy applications of the martingales described in the previous section .",
    "we will show an intuitive way to obtain a solution to the skorokhod embedding problem , as given by azma and yor @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss relations between the law of @xmath147 and the conditional law of @xmath148 knowing @xmath147 , for some stopping time @xmath149 . in the second subsection",
    "we will derive well - known bounds on the law of @xmath147 , when the law of @xmath148 is fixed .",
    "we will then continue in the same vein and describe the law of @xmath150 , when the law of @xmath148 is fixed .",
    "we will end with a discussion of penalization of brownian motion with a function of its supremum and some absolute continuity relations .",
