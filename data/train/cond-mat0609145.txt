    "what is important is that each node in the first generation ( on distance one from the root ) is linked to many nodes in the second generation ; only a few nodes in the first generation have a finite ( not diverging with @xmath86 ) number of links to the nodes of the second generation .",

    "flows in complete graphs exhibit simple asymptotic behavior .",
    "the maximal flux from an arbitrarily chosen source node to an arbitrarily chosen sink node scales as @xmath164 and fluctuations about this average are asymptotically negligible . to show this we first notice that for a complete graph with @xmath165 nodes , the flow from node 0 ( source ) to node @xmath86 ( sink ) can not exceed @xmath166 which is asymptotically @xmath167 ( fluctuations are of the order of @xmath168 ) .",
