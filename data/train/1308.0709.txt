    "the exact stick and crossing numbers of links are difficult to ascertain in general . the advent of knot polynomials , however , provided an effective tool for determining the crossing number of large classes of links .",
    "knot polynomials were used to find the crossing number of alternating and adequate links @xcite , as well as that of torus links ( see @xcite ) .    similarly , finding the precise stick number of classes of links is a difficult task .",
    "this was accomplished for the family of torus links @xmath8 , with @xmath9 by jin in 1997 @xcite and extended to @xmath10 in 2013 by johnson , mills , and trapp @xcite .",
    "the basic idea was to construct the link using few sticks , then show the construction to be optimal using the superbridge number .",
    "the stick numbers of @xmath11 torus knots , together with their compositions , were determined by adams , brennan , greilsheimer , and woo in 1997 @xcite , and those of @xmath12 by adams and shayler in 2009 @xcite .",
    "these results are obtained by again constructing the link efficiently , then using projections and total curvature ( or bridge number ) considerations to prove them optimal . in both cases ,",
    "the lower bounds come from geometric properties of torus links .",
    "thus the classes of links with known stick number are rare and enjoy specific geometric properties .",
    "in addition to stick numbers of torus links , upper bounds for the stick numbers of 2-bridge links have been the object of some study . in 1998 , furstenberg ,",
    "lie , and schneider found that @xmath13 for 2-bridge links with few tangles @xcite . in the same year , mccabe found that @xmath14 for arbitrary 2-bridge links , a considerable extension of results of furstenberg et al . resulting from the addition of one stick @xcite .",
    "mccabe then conjectured that her upper bound could be improved to @xmath15 and noted that her construction leads to minimal crossing projections .",

    "both twisting and writhing contribute to the crossing number of a tangle , in contrast with figure  [ oldtangle ] where all crossings result from twisting .",

    "an application of the improved bound is given in section [ crossings ] .",
    "previous polygonal constructions of 2-bridge links admitted minimal crossing projections .",
    "in contrast , we use theorem [ thm:2bridgeupperbound ] to show that minimal stick representatives of 2-bridge links do not admit minimal crossing projections when the crossing number is large relative to the number of tangles .",
    "in this section we describe a piecewise linear construction of supercoiled integral tangles and how to glue them together to build polygonal 2-bridge links .",
    "the result is an improved upper bound for the stick number of 2-bridge links with crossing number roughly six times the number of tangles or more .",
    "see theorem [ thm:2bridgeupperbound ] for a precise statement .    in what follows",
    "we describe how to construct a supercoiled integral tangle with negative crossings . to construct one with positive crossings , simply take the mirror image of the ones constructed here .",
    "start with a piecewise linear _ core _ and label the @xmath20 edges @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ core ] shows such a core viewed from two different directions .",
    "we choose to index the edges with @xmath20 since the first and last edges of the tangle have a free endpoint ( see remark  [ remark1 ] after lemma  [ lemma : integraltangle ] as well ) .",
    "also , let @xmath22 denote the vertex at the intersection of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we will add two new vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 next to each vertex @xmath22 , and then we connect the @xmath25 s and @xmath27 s to create the polygonal strands of the tangle",

    "the behavior of the new edges near the vertices and self - crossings of the core allow us to count the number of crossings in the constructed integral tangle .",
    "the core has @xmath20 edges yielding @xmath39 internal vertices @xmath40 and @xmath41 self - crossings .",

    "further , each self - crossing of the core yields two sets of parallel strands in the tangle that cross each other .",
    "such a conformation contributes a full twist , or two crossings , to the integral tangle ( as in figure  [ create ] ) .",
    "thus in the tangle there are a total of @xmath42 crossings .",

    "to construct a tangle with crossing number @xmath46 , we connect @xmath47 to @xmath48 and @xmath49 to @xmath50 as in figure  [ core1 ] , and leave the remaining connections the same .",
    "this uses the same number of sticks as the previous case , but reduces the crossing number of the tangle by one .",
    "reasoning as above gives the desired result , @xmath51 .    to construct a tangle with crossing number @xmath52 , we add a new vertex @xmath53 that lies below @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",

    "this uses one more stick than in the @xmath46 case , but yields @xmath54 crossings .",

    "since the projection is reduced and alternating , it has minimal crossing number @xcite .",
    "we now construct polygonal representatives of 2-bridge links .",
    "to do so we will first turn a standard diagram into a linear planar graph with @xmath57 edges , and then insert supercoiled tangles to result in the desired 2-bridge link .",
    "start with the standard diagram of a 2-bridge link in figure  [ conway ] , and shrink each integral tangle to a vertex .",
    "the regions around each vertex are decorated with a core to indicate which direction the integral tangle should be inserted .",
    "the result is a 4-valent planar graph decorated with a core extending out of each vertex in two of its four surrounding regions ( see step 1 of figure  [ figure : algorithm ] ) .",

    "the graph looks like the first image in figure  [ break ] .",
    "replace the single vertex with two vertices stacked directly on top of each other , so that the two northern edges and core stay attached to the bottom vertex and the two southern strands and core stay attached to the top vertex .",
    "we then shift the vertices horizontally with respect to the projection direction so that cores and edges cross each other as in the second step of figure  [ break ] .",
    "perform the previous two steps on all vertices concurrently .",
    "these steps can be performed in such a way that they do not alter the topology of the graph outside the 3-balls .",
    "recall from remark [ remark1 ] that constructing a tangle with @xmath1 crossings requires a core with @xmath20 edges where @xmath56 .",
    "we already have two edges of the core inside the 3-ball , and must add @xmath41 edges to complete the core .",
    "label the bottom vertex @xmath59 and the top vertex @xmath60 .",
    "add a polygonal core that starts at the vertex @xmath59 , writhes around the strands and the core that are adjacent to the vertex @xmath59 a total of @xmath61 times and connects to the other vertex @xmath60 as in the third step of figure  [ break ] .",
    "this core will act as the core of the supercoiled tangle in the construction decribed prior to lemma  [ lemma : integraltangle ] . for @xmath62 place the @xmath25 and @xmath26 as in that construction .",
    "the placement of the vertices @xmath63 requires some extra care .",
    "attach edges from @xmath48 and @xmath50 to the vertex @xmath59 , creating a double point in the tangle .",

    "label the appropriate points of that resolution @xmath47 and @xmath49 as in figure  [ 3d ] .",
    "use the same technique for placing @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we may choose @xmath31 small enough so that the topology outside the @xmath66-balls is unchanged .",
    "when @xmath67 or @xmath68 we are done . if @xmath52 an extra stick must be added as in the proof of lemma [ lemma : integraltangle ] . applying this construction inside each 3-ball",
    "results in a polygonal link that is isotopic to our original @xmath43-bridge link .",

    "then the stick number @xmath6 of @xmath0 satisfies    @xmath74    the portion of the graph outside of the @xmath66-balls consists of @xmath57 sticks . in each @xmath66-ball , a supercoiled tangle uses four sticks from the outside @xmath57 sticks .",
    "hence each of these tangles uses four less sticks than the stick numbers stipulated by lemma [ lemma : integraltangle ]",
    ". the construction yields the upper bound    @xmath75    we make a few observations to put this result in context .",
    "this improves on the previous upper bound as long as the upper bound of theorem  [ thm:2bridgeupperbound ] is less than @xmath15 .",
    "solving that inequality for crossing number , we see that theorem  [ thm:2bridgeupperbound ] is an improvement for    @xmath76 intuitively , if there are at least six times as many crossings as tangles , the supercoiling technique is preferable .",
    "in particular , if each twist has more than seven crossings supercoiling provides a better construction .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar bounds on crossings in twists appear when considering hyperbolic structures on knots .",
    "purcell proves that any knot or link with at least 6 crossings in each twist region is hyperbolic if its augmented link is .",
    "moreover , she obtains twist number bounds on hyperbolic volume when each twist region has at least seven crossings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one wonders if there is a connection between hyperbolic volumes , supercoiling , and stick number .",
    "secondly , let us interpret theorem  [ thm:2bridgeupperbound ] in the case where the number of tangles is fixed but the crossing number increases without bound . for fixed @xmath3 and large @xmath1 , theorem  [ thm:2bridgeupperbound ] says that the stick number is asymptotically at worst two - thirds the crossing number .",
    "previous upper bounds predicted that stick number is at worst asymptotic to the crossing number .",
    "an obvious question is whether or not the two - thirds bound is optimal .",

    "since all crossings in an integral tangle admit the same flypes , we will speak of tangles as admitting flypes .",
    "we now classify the non - trivial flypes in the standard diagram of a 2-bridge link ( see @xcite for more details regarding flype orbits ) .",
    "the first and last tangles do not admit non - trivial flypes because in the only decomposition of the complement into 4-tangles one of them is trivial ( see figure  [ 101]a ) .",
