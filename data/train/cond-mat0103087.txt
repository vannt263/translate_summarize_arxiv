    "the apparent metallic - like temperature dependence of the resistivity is observed in various two - dimensional ( 2d ) carrier systems @xcite and remains a focus of a broad interest because it challenges the conventional theory of the metallic conduction .",
    "the effect manifests itself in a strong drop of the resistivity over a limited range of temperatures , @xmath0 , from a high temperature value ( call it ` drude ' value ) @xmath1 to a low temperature one @xmath2 , here @xmath3 is the fermi temperature . upon lowering the temperature further , a strong ` metallic ' drop in @xmath4",
    "was found to cross over to the conventional weak localization type dependence @xcite .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated @xcite that the ` metallic ' drop is not related to quantum interference and in this sense should have a semiclassical origin .",
    "magnetic field applied in the plane of the 2d system causes a dramatic increase in resistivity @xcite .",
    "it was proven experimentally @xcite that the magnetoresistance ( mr ) in si - mos samples is mainly caused by spin - effects , though certain contribution of orbital effects @xcite is noticeable at very large fields @xcite , bigger than the field of the spin polarization .",
    "the two effects , _ strong metallic drop in resistivity _  and _ parallel field magnetoresistance _ remain _",
    "puzzling_.    in this paper we demonstrate that ( i ) the strength of both effects is well matched and ( ii ) the action of magnetic field on conduction is similar to that of disorder and to some extent to that of temperature",
    ". in particular , in the presence of in - plane magnetic field the strong temperature dependence of the resistivity for a high mobility sample transforms into a weaker one and shifts to higher temperatures ; both these features are typical for low mobility samples .",
    "next , ( iii ) the effect of the magnetic field on the resistivity is continuous and shows no signatures of a threshold . finally , ( iv ) increase in either temperature or parallel magnetic field restores the same high - temperature ( ` drude ' ) resistivity value while transport remains non - activated .",
    "matching of the actions of the above controlling parameters sets substantial constraints on the choice of theoretical models .",
    "we performed measurements on a number of different mobility ( 100 ) @xmath5si - mos samples , because this system demonstrates the most dramatic appearance of the discussed effects .",
    "table  [ samples ] below shows the relevant parameters for the four most intensively studied samples whose mobilities differ by a factor of  25 ; parameters for other samples were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".relevant parameters of the five samples .",
    "@xmath6 [ m@xmath7/vs ] is the peak mobility at @xmath8k , @xmath9 is in units of @xmath10 , and   @xmath11 is in @xmath12@xmath13 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the curve _ 3 _ , the fit is not perfect because it oscillates vs temperature , which is beyond the frameworks of the model .",
    "the only steep feature may be found in the field dependence of @xmath14 at the transition from insulating to metallic behavior ; this however may be caused by a minor mismatching of the oversimplified model curves in the metallic and insulating ranges .",
    "the ` activation energy ' @xmath15 depends on the choice of the model and on average is 2 - 3 times larger than the values estimated from fig .",
    "the right columns in table 2 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is presumably caused by the admixture to the data of a non - exponential temperature dependence which is essentially strong for the considered sample and which can not be separated at low temperatures from the exponential one .",
    "for example , we were able to achieve a reasonable fit of the data with eq .",
    "( 2 ) , using the _ calculated _ in table  2 values @xmath16 when we modeled the ` tilted separatrix ' in eq .",
    "( [ tilted ] ) by a power low factor , @xmath17 , rather than by the polynomial factor .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was stated that `` the effect of magnetic field can not be ascribed solely to a field - induced change in the critical electron density '' .",
    "we verified this possibility and arrive at the opposite conclusion .",
    "the success of our fitting confirms that the action of the parallel field , at least , to the first approximation consists in progressive increase of disorder .",
    "this is described by increasing the @xmath18-independent scattering rate @xmath19 , decreasing the magnitude of the resistivity drop , @xmath20 , and increasing the critical carrier density @xmath21 ; the three parameters are not independent and within the same material system may be reduced only to the single parameter , e.g. @xmath21 .",
    "to summarize , the results reported in this paper demonstrate that the effect of the parallel magnetic field on resistivity in high mobility si - mos samples ( though via zeeman coupling ) is similar to that of disorder and , to some extent , to that of temperature . in other words , _ parallel magnetic field increases disorder_. the temperature dependence of resistivity for various disorder and magnetic fields may be reduced to the dependences of the ` critical ' density @xmath11 on magnetic field and on disorder ; the changes in the resistivity drop with temperature , @xmath22 , caused by disorder and magnetic field may be also mapped onto each other .",
    "we find a similarity between the action of the parallel field and temperature for the region of carrier density and field where conduction remains ` non - activated ' .",
    "these findings set constraints on the choice of the developed microscopic models .    the analogy between the parallel field and disorder points to the existence of a sub - band of localized carriers",
    ". such band of localized carriers should lift in energy as a function of the parallel field , gets ` undressed ' after passing through the fermi energy and cause the increase in the scattering rate .",
    "the strong evidence for this mechanism is the variation in the hall voltage observed in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we can not exclude also the contribution of the inter spin - subband scattering , as a complementary feature to the above mechanism .",
    "however , our shubnikov - de haas data @xcite indicates that the mobility in different spin and valley sub - bands of conducting electrons are almost equal and the intersubband scattering does not play a major role in the themperature- and parallel field- dependence of the resistance . applying the model of a field dependent disorder",
    ", we find a qualitative explanation of the whole set of presented results .",
