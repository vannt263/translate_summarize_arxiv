    "studies of the host galaxies of low - redshift quasars can enable us to define the subset of the present - day galaxy population which is capable of producing quasar - level nuclear activity .",
    "this is of obvious importance for constraining physical models of quasar evolution ( small & blandford 1992 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; kauffman & haehnelt 2000 ) , and for exploring the connection between black - hole and galaxy formation ( silk & rees 1998 , fabian 1999 , franceschini et al .",
    "1999 , granato et al .",
    "2001 , kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) .",
    "such observations are also of value for testing unified models of radio - loud agn ( e.g. peacock 1987 , barthel 1989 , urry & padovani 1995 ) , constraining possible evolutionary links between ulirgs and quasars ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , exploring the origin of radio - loudness ( blandford 2000 ) , and as a means to estimate the masses of the central black holes which power the active nuclei ( mclure et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "our view of low - redshift quasar hosts has been clarified enormously over the last five years , primarily due to the angular resolution and dynamic range offered by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "after some initial confusion , recent hst - based studies have now reached agreement that the hosts of all luminous quasars ( @xmath2 ) are bright galaxies with @xmath9 ( bahcall et al .",
    "1997 , mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "mcleod & mcleod 2001 ) .",
    "however , it can be argued , ( with considerable justification ) that this much had already been established from earlier ground - based studies ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "1986 , vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 , taylor et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , as first convincingly demonstrated by disney et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the major advance offered by the hst for the study of quasar hosts is that it allows host galaxies to be mapped out over sufficient angular and dynamic range for a de vaucouleurs @xmath10-law spheroidal component to be clearly distinguished from an exponential disc , at least for redshifts @xmath11 .",
    "this is not to suggest that agn host - galaxy morphological discrimination has proved impossible from the ground . indeed for lower - luminosity agn at @xmath12 , such as seyfert galaxies , ground - based imaging has proved perfectly adequate for this task ( e.g. hunt et al . 1999 ) and in fact some early ground - based attempts to determine the morphology of low - redshift quasar hosts have also proved to be robust ( e.g. smith et al . 1986 ) .",
    "however , to ensure an unbiassed comparison of rqq and rlq hosts it is necessary to study host galaxies at @xmath13 and to be able to determine host - galaxy morphologies for quasars with luminosities up to @xmath14 . even by moving to the infrared to minimize nuclear : host ratio , taylor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that this could not be reliably achieved with typical ground - based seeing .",
    "nevertheless , great care needs to be taken to extract the full benefit of hst imaging of quasar hosts .",
    "in particular , deep observations are required to detect the extended low surface - brightness emission of even a massive host galaxy at @xmath15 to a radius of several arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "unfortunately however , this inevitably leads to saturation of the nucleus , making accurate characterization of the luminosity of the central source impossible .",
    "this is crucial because , at the depths of interest for reliable host - galaxy characterization , scattered light in the wfpc2 psf still makes a significant contribution to surface brightness out to an angular radius @xmath16 arcsec ( mclure , dunlop & kukula 2000 ) .",
    "as demonstrated by mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) , these problems of surface brightness bias , saturation , and inadequate knowledge of the large - angle properties of the true wfpc2 psf , can explain much of the confusion produced by the first studies of quasar hosts undertaken after the correction of the hst optics with costar ( e.g. bahcall , kirhakos & schneider 1994 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the final results from our 34-orbit cycle-6 imaging study of quasar hosts , which was carefully designed to avoid these problems .",
    "specifically , we acquired images of each quasar spanning a wide range of integration times ( to allow an unsaturated , high dynamic - range image of each object to be constructed ) and devoted an entire orbit to the construction of the necessary high dynamic - range psf ( via observations of a star of similar colour to the quasar nuclei , imaged at the same location on the same wf chip ) .",
    "results from the first half of this programme were reported in mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where images for 19 objects from our 33-source sample were presented , modelled and analyzed . here",
    "we present and model the images for the 14 targets which were observed in the latter half of 1998 and in 1999 , and then summarize and discuss the results derived from the analysis of the completed sample .",
    "the results presented in this paper thus complete , extend and in several cases supercede those presented in mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( e.g. estimated black - hole masses for all objects are now calculated using more recent estimates of the black - hole : spheroid mass relation , yielding significantly lower values than were calculated by mclure et al . based on the relation presented by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) .",
    "several other substantial studies of low - redshift quasar hosts have now been undertaken with the hst ( e.g. bahcall , kirkhados & schneider 1997 ; hooper , impey & foltz 1997 ; boyce et al .",
    "1998 , mcleod & mcleod 2001 ) .",
    "however , one unique feature of the present study is the deliberate focus on a comparison of the hosts of the three main classes of powerful agn , namely radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and radio galaxies ( rgs ) .",
    "moreover , we have ensured that this comparison can be performed in an unbiassed manner by confining our sample to a narrow range in redshift ( @xmath17 ) and requiring that the individual sub - samples are matched in terms of their luminosity distributions ( optical luminosity in the case of the rqq and rlq sub - samples , and radio luminosity in the case of the rlq and rg sub - samples - see dunlop et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and section 2 for further details ) .",
    "another strength of this study is the wealth of pre - existing data at other wavelengths , as detailed in section 2 .",
    "this has allowed us to maximise the impact of the hst imaging ( through , for example , the determination of @xmath18 colours for all the host galaxies ) .",
    "finally it is worth emphasizing that in this study we have sought to extract the properties of the stellar population which dominates the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , while we do include a statistical analysis of the prevalence of peculiar features such as tidal tails , we have endevoured to minimize the distorting effect of the more transient activity by insisting on line - free imaging longward of the 4000  break , and masking out obvious assymmetries prior to modelling the host morphology .",
    "this approach , coupled with the careful design of our observations , is the most likely explanation for why the results presented in this paper are generally cleaner , and more homogenous than the results of many other recent studies .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the main properties of the matched rg , rlq and rqq samples , and summarize the wealth of supporting ground - based multi - frequency data which now exists for these objects . in section 3",
    "we give details of the hst observations and briefly review the process of data reduction and psf determination ( mclure et al .",
    "1999 ; mclure , dunlop & kukula 2000 ) .",
    "then , in section 4 we give a brief description of the new vla observations of the rqqs in our sample which escaped previous radio detection by kukula et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and present new 5  ghz flux densities and positions . in section 5",
    "we present the new hst data and briefly summarize the approach taken to modelling the wfpc2 images ; the images and 2-dimensional model fits for the 14 new objects are provided in appendix a ( along with brief notes on each source ) , with observed and fitted luminosity profiles presented in appendix b. next , in section 6 we analyze the results of modelling the hst images of the complete sample , and assess the implications of our results for unified models of agn . in section 7",
    "we explore how quasar hosts relate to the general population of massive galaxies , and demonstrate via the kormendy relation that the quasar hosts are drawn from the population of massive ` boxy ' ellipticals which are found predominantly in cluster environments .",
    "we also include a comparison of the environments and interaction statistics for quasar hosts and brightest cluster galaxies . in section 8",
    "we exploit our results to investigate the properties of the central engines which power these luminous agn , deriving estimates of black - hole mass and eddington ratio , and exploring possible clues to the origin of radio - loudness .",
    "finally , in section 9 we briefly discuss the implications of our results for the cosmological evolution of quasars and massive galaxies .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 10 .",
    "for ease of comparison with previous work we adopt an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath19 for the calculation of physical quantities throughout this paper .",
    "the hst imaging observations reported here complete the imaging of the full sample of 33 objects ( 10 rlqs , 13 rqqs and 10 rgs ) defined for this study .",
    "this sample was selected from the slightly larger ( 40-source ) sample imaged in the infrared by dunlop et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and taylor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) through the imposition of the slightly more restrictive redshift limits @xmath17 .",
    "as described in mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , this restriction in redshift range ensures that our @xmath0-band imaging through the f675w filter is not contaminated by the presence of strong emission lines such as [ oiii ] , or h@xmath20 . the main effect of this additional redshift restriction is to exclude a small number of objects from the original sample of dunlop et al .",
    "( 1993 ) which have @xmath21 .",
    "however , this has not significantly compromised the original statistical merits of this sample , namely that the rlq and rqq sub - samples are matched in terms of optical luminosity , and that the rlq and rg samples are matched in terms of radio luminosity and radio spectral index ( dunlop et al .",
    "1993 ) .    of the 33 sources in this sample ,",
    "19 were observed during the first year of our cycle 6 allocation .",
    "the observations and analysis of these objects were presented by mclure et al .",
    "the remaining 14 objects for which the observations are presented and analyzed in this paper are listed in table 1 , along with the dates on which they were observed with the hst .    also included in this paper are new , deep vla observations of a subset of our rqq sample .",
    "these 4.8  ghz observations , the results of which are presented in section 4 , go a factor of 3 deeper than the observations of kukula et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which were utilised by mclure et al .",
    "the important outcome of these observations is that we have now detected all but one of the rqqs in this sample at radio wavelengths .",
    "these new radio detections , coupled with completion of the hst observations , have allowed us to re - investigate and clarify a number of the relations between optical and radio properties which could only be tentatively explored by mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    .observing dates for the objects presented in this paper .",
    "note that , despite its archive designation as 3c59 , 0204@xmath22292 is in fact now classified as an rqq ( see taylor et al .",
    "1996 , and the radio luminosity quoted in table 3 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    beyond confirming the basic plausibility of the black - hole mass estimates , the most interesting result contained in fig 13 is that , as suggested by the initial results of mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the black - hole masses in the radio - loud quasars are systematically larger than in their radio - quiet counterparts . in terms of summary statistics of central tendency ,",
    "this difference , although clear , might not appear very dramatic  specifically , excluding the two low - luminosity rqqs :    @xmath23 = median = 1.3 = ( rg ) + @xmath24 median = 1.4 ( rlq ) + @xmath25 median = 0.8 ( rqq )    however , the difference becomes more striking when one notices that there is an apparent threshold mass of @xmath26 _ above _ which lie 8/10 rgs and 10/10 rlqs , but _ below _ which lie 9/13 of the rqqs . in other words , using the black - hole mass estimation procedure outlined above , at least within this particular sample it appears that a black - hole mass @xmath27 is a necessary ( albeit perhaps not sufficient ) condition for the production of a powerful radio source . as measured via the ks test",
    ", this difference between the black - hole mass distributions of the radio - loud and radio - quiet subsamples is significant at the 3-@xmath28 level , a significance which must be taken seriously given the almost perfect matching of the distributions of nuclear optical output demonstrated in fig 4 .",
    "further support for its reality comes from the @xmath29 study by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) already referred to above , in which it was found that 11/13 rlqs had @xmath30 while only 4/18 rqqs had black - hole masses above this threshold .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached by laor ( 2000 ) from a study of the virial masses of pg quasars .",
    "an inevitable consequence of the matching of nuclear optical luminosities demonstrated in fig 4 , and the systematic offset in black - hole mass described above is that , on average , the black holes at the heart of the rqqs in our sample must , on average , be emitting more efficiently than their radio - loud counterparts .",
    "this is quantified in the last two columns of table 9 which give estimated eddington luminosity ( converted to @xmath0-band absolute magnitude ) and then emitting efficiency @xmath31 .",
    "the potential @xmath32band eddington luminosity of each quasar was derived in the following manner .",
    "initially , the host - galaxy bulge luminosities provided by the two - dimensional modelling were converted into a spheroidal mass estimate using the j@xmath33rgensen et al .",
    "mass - to - light ratio ( eqn 7 ) .",
    "the linear relation between black - hole mass and spheroidal mass ( eqn 8) was then used to estimate the central black - hole mass and resulting bolometric eddington luminosity of each quasar . to calculate the corresponding @xmath32band magnitudes it was assumed that",
    ", on average , the bolometric luminosity of a quasar can be estimated via @xmath34 ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , where @xmath35 is the absolute monochromatic luminosity at 5100  .",
    "the resulting estimate of the absolute luminosity at 5100  was then transformed to the central wavelength of the @xmath32 filter ( 6500   ) assuming a power - law quasar spectrum ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "using this prescription , a quasar with a central black - hole mass of @xmath37 will have an eddington - limit absolute @xmath32band magnitude of @xmath38",
    ".    observed nuclear @xmath39 is plotted against potential eddington - limited @xmath39 in fig 14 .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the maximum luminosity produced by any quasar is within a factor of two of the predicted eddington limit , while the majority appear to be radiating at @xmath40 of the eddington luminosity . taken as a group there is a suggestion that the rqqs are radiating at a higher percentage of the eddington limit , but the difference is not formally significant ( ks , @xmath41 ) .",
    "when the matched samples of rlqs and rqqs were first defined , all that was known about the radio properties of the rqqs was that their 5  ghz luminosities were lower than @xmath42 ( dunlop et al . 1993 ) . however , with the completion of the vla detection programme described in section 4 we can now explore how the radio properties of _ all _ the agn in our combined sample relate to their estimated black - hole masses .    in fig 15 total radio luminosity , @xmath43 ,",
    "is plotted against estimated black - hole mass for all the objects in our combined sample ( with the single exception of 1549@xmath22203 , which was not observed with the vla to the same depth as the other objects ) .",
    "also included in this diagram are the appropriate points for 8 nearby galaxies taken from franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , with the milky way and m87 highlighted .",
    "several significant trends are evident in this diagram .",
    "first it can be seen that , within the rqq sample , radio luminosity correlates , albeit weakly , with black - hole mass , although our sample does nt span a wide dynamic range and the correlation is not formally significant . second , and perhaps more interestingly , the rqqs are consistent with the locus described by the nearby galaxies ( for which , of course , the black - hole masses are based directly on stellar dynamics ) .",
    "this simultaneously reinforces the plausibility of our black - hole mass estimates , and suggests a common physical origin for the radio emission from rqqs and nearby optically more - quiescent bulges .",
    "whatever this physical mechanism is , it must explain the observed strong dependence of minimum radio output on black - hole mass , in which the power - law index @xmath44 is at least 2 ( adopting @xmath45 ) . as noted by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , @xmath46 is the prediction of adaf models , while @xmath47 is a generic prediction of any mechanism in which radio output is proportional to the area of the accretion disc .",
    "our results therefore provide further support for previous claims that there is a minimum radio output from black holes and that this is a strong function of mass .",
    "however , while this obviously implies that the most massive black holes can never be _ very _ radio - quiet , fig 15 graphically demonstrates that the genuine radio - loud objects lie on a quite distinct relation .",
    "interestingly , our radio - loud sample also displays an ( albeit weak ) internal correlation between @xmath43 and estimated black - hole mass .",
    "either this relationship must be much steeper ( @xmath48 ) than the minimum radio - output relation , or , as illustrated in fig 15 , the black - hole mass dependence of the upper envelope may be consistent with that of the lower envelope but offset by several orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact the findings of lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) strongly favour the latter option .",
    "they report a relationship between the logarithm of radio power and black - hole mass which has a slope of @xmath49 .",
    "however , inspection of their fig 2 shows that their data are also consistent with an upper and lower envelope with slope @xmath50 as illustrated here in fig 15 .    we note here that it has recently been claimed by oshlack , webster & whiting ( 2001 ) that the radio - loud seyfert galaxy pks 2004@xmath51447 contradicts the existence of such an envelope , and shows that relatively low - mass black holes can produce a powerful radio source .",
    "however , this claim is based on their black - hole mass estimate for this object of @xmath52 and it seems almost certain that this value , derived from the relatively narrow emission lines displayed by pks 2004@xmath51447 , is a serious under - estimate of the true mass .",
    "the reason for this is that since this object displays optically variability and has a compact radio source , it seems very likely that its orbiting broad - line region lies close to plane of the sky .",
    "in this situation ( as found in our own sample for , e.g. 1012@xmath22008 - see table 9 ) the black - hole mass derived from @xmath53 emission - line width can under - estimate the true value by a factor @xmath54 . in fig 15",
    "we have plotted the position of pks 2004@xmath51447 after re - calculating its black - hole mass on the assumption that the orbital plane of its broad - line region is oriented within @xmath55 degrees of the plane of the sky ( see mclure & dunlop 2001 ) .",
    "this increases the estimated black - hole mass to @xmath56 , and moves pks 2004@xmath51447 into complete consistency with the upper envelope delineated by the other available data .",
    "we have not corrected the observed radio emission for doppler boosting - if we did then the this object would simply move downwards in fig 15 .",
    "thus both our own results and other currently available data support the existence of both a lower and an upper envelope to the radio luminosity which can be produced by a black hole of given mass .",
    "indeed fig 15 serves to provide an elegant explanation not only of our own findings , but also of several other well - known results in the literature .",
    "first , because we selected our radio - loud objects on the basis that their radio luminosities were greater than @xmath57 , the form of the upper envelope in these figures can be seen to be perfectly consistent with our finding that virtually all our radio - loud objects have @xmath58 . in the context of this diagram this finding can be seen to be a result of our radio - selection criterion rather than the existence of some critical black - hole mass for the production of relativistic jets within a galaxy mass halo .",
    "second , the steep dependence of this apparent upper envelope on black hole mass means that radio sources up to @xmath59 , consistent with the most luminous 3cr galaxies even at @xmath60 _ can _ be produced by black holes ( and hence hosts ) only a factor of 2 - 3 more massive , and most likely _ will _ be due to the steep high - mass slope of the black - hole mass function .",
    "this provides a natural explanation of why radio galaxies spanning the top two orders of magnitude in radio power all appear to be giant ellipticals with stellar masses which agree to within a factor of @xmath61 ( jarvis et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "third , from fig 15 it can be seen that the properties of agn hosts will inevitably become more mixed if the radio - luminosity threshold is move down to , say , @xmath62 .",
    "given the lower boundary in fig 15 , radio sources in this power range can still be produced by black holes as massive as @xmath63 living in giant ellipticals , but it is also clear that black holes with masses as low as 10@xmath64 are capable of producing detectable radio sources at this level . as demonstrated by the properties of the lower - luminosity objects in our own sample , and by the studies of ` normal ' galaxies at low redshift , such black holes can be housed in disc - dominated galaxies as well as discless lower - mass spheroids .",
    "while the broad dependence of radio luminosity on black - hole mass may explain the relative numbers of radio - quiet and radio - loud objects , it is also clear from fig 15 that black hole mass can not be invoked to explain the _ range _ of radio luminosities displayed by quasars of very similar optical luminosity .",
    "specifically it is clear from this figure that objects powered by equally massive black holes can differ in radio luminosity by @xmath65 orders of magnitude .",
    "interestingly fig 15 also allows us to rule out the possibility that the radio output of a black hole of given mass is driven simply by fuel supply .",
    "this is because , while it has long been known that rqqs are not radio silent , it can be seen from fig 15 that several of the rqqs in our sample are in fact as radio - silent as they could possibly be , given their estimated black - hole masses . in other words",
    "at least some of the black holes in rqqs produce as little radio output as their counterparts in completely quiescent nearby galaxies , despite the fact that black holes in quasars are clearly in receipt of sufficient fuel to produce powerful _ optical _ emission .",
    "thus , while the results of this study can not by themselves provide a definitive answer to the long standing question of the origin of radio loudness , they can be used to focus the argument by excluding several possible explanations . in summary ,",
    "our results can be used to exclude host galaxy morphology , black - hole mass , or black hole fueling rate as the primary physical cause of radio loudness .",
    "we are thus forced to the conclusion that the production of powerful relativistic radio jets is driven by some other property of the black hole itself , the most likely candidate being black - hole spin ( e.g. blandford 2000 , wilson & colbert 1995 ) . indeed , following the suggestion by blandford ( 2000 ) , we speculate that the evolutionary track followed by an activated black hole may manifest itself as a near vertical descent in fig 15 , with an active rapidly spinning hole appearing first as a powerful radio source close to the upper envelope in this diagram , and then descending towards the lower envelope as the spin energy of the hole",
    "is exhausted .",
    "one interesting aspect of the different black - hole mass thresholds for rqqs and rlqs uncovered by this study is that this difference of a factor of 2 in minimum black - hole mass provides a natural explanation of why radio - quiet quasars outnumber their radio - loud counterparts by a factor of @xmath16 ( and why this factor may reduce with increasing optical luminosity ; hooper et al .",
    "1995 , goldschmidt et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this is because if our black - hole mass thresholds of @xmath66 for rqqs , and @xmath67  @xmath68 for radio - loud objects are converted back into absolute spheroid magnitudes in the @xmath69-band ( using the absolute @xmath0-band magnitudes given in table 4 , and then converting into @xmath69 adopting @xmath70 as justified by the results in section 6.6 ) we find that rqqs can be hosted by spheroids with @xmath71 while radio - loud objects require a host spheroid with @xmath72 . with reference to the @xmath69-band luminosity function",
    "these absolute magnitude limits correspond to @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively ( gardner et al .",
    "1997 , szolkoly et al .",
    "1998 , kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ) which leads to the prediction that , in the present day universe there are @xmath75 galaxies per @xmath76 capable of hosting an rqq brighter than @xmath77 , but only @xmath78 galaxies per @xmath76 are capable of hosting an rlq .",
    "this means that , assuming low - redshift quasars arise from a randomly - triggered subset of massive black - holes in spheroids , the factor of two difference in black - hole mass threshold translates into a factor of 10 difference in the number density of rqqs and rlqs due simply to the steepness of the bright end of the spheroid luminosity function .",
    "we can go further and use the above numbers to estimate the activation fraction for massive black holes in the local universe .",
    "first we note that the radio - loud objects in our sample have @xmath80 ( assuming a spectral index @xmath81 ) .",
    "reference to the local radio luminosity function in dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , or to the more recent determination at 1.4 ghz from the 2df by sadler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , indicates that the present - day number density of radio sources above this threshold is @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in the present - day universe we find that 1 in every 1000 black holes more massive than @xmath83  @xmath68 ( or equivalently spheroids more luminous than @xmath84 ) is radio active in the present - day universe .    turning to the rqq population",
    ", the present - day number density of quasars with @xmath85 can be estimated by extrapolating the qso olf deduced at @xmath86 by boyle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) back to @xmath87 assuming luminosity evolution @xmath88 .",
    "this produces an estimated number density of @xmath89  @xmath90 , which is at least consistent with the direct determination of the low-@xmath91 olf attempted by londish , boyle & schade ( 2000 ) . boosting this number by a factor of two to allow for obscured quasars ( i.e. adopting an opening angle of @xmath92 for consistency with the correction factor which appears to apply to the radio - loud population ) then leads to the conclusion that 1 in every 1000 black holes more massive than @xmath93  @xmath68 ( or equivalently spheroids more luminous than @xmath94 ) is producing quasar - level optical activity .",
    "thus both these comparisons yield the same result , namely that in the present - day ( @xmath12 ) universe 1 in every 1000 massive black holes is active , and that the reason rqqs outnumber rlqs by a factor of 10 is a direct result of the fact that their respective minimum black - hole masses differ by a factor of two .",
    "we note here that wisotzki , kuhlbrodt & jahnke ( 2001 ) have recently concluded that the present - day black - hole activation fraction is 1 in 10000 , or 1 in 5000 if the quasar lf is boosted by a factor of two as assumed above .",
    "however , reference to their fig 2 shows that this factor results from adopting the spheroid luminosity function of lin et al .",
    "if instead wisotzki et al . were to adopt the kochanek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) luminosity function then it is clear that ( at least for the mass range probed by the present study ) wisotzki et al.s analysis would also yield an activation fraction of 0.1% .      at the peak epoch of quasar activity between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ,",
    "the co - moving number density of powerful radio sources with @xmath80 has risen to @xmath98  @xmath90 ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ) while that of optically - selected quasars brighter than @xmath77 is @xmath99  @xmath90 ( warren , hewett & osmer 1995 , boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) . doubling the latter figure to make the same correction for obscured rqqs as applied in the previous subsection at low redshift , leads to the conclusion that ,",
    "as at @xmath100 , rqqs at @xmath101 outnumber their radio - loud counterparts by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "however , at @xmath101 the co - moving number density of both classes of object is enhanced by a factor of 100 , giving an activation fraction of massive black holes of @xmath16% , assuming that the entire massive black - hole population is in place by that epoch .",
    "a renewed attempt to model the cosmological evolution of agn in the light of our host - galaxy results is obviously beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , if one assumes that the same mass thresholds uncovered in our low - redshift study apply at high redshift , then one simple interpretation of the dramatic ( and very similar ) evolution of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn between @xmath101 and the present - day is that it is primarily due to density evolution , with the active fraction of massive black holes dropping from 10% to 0.1% over this period .",
    "there must of course also be an element of luminosity evolution because pure density evolution was excluded long ago as an acceptable representation of the evolving rlf or olf .",
    "however , as suggested by miller , percival & lambert ( in preparation ) if individual quasars produce declining light curves it is inevitable that a larger fraction will be observed closer to peak luminosity as the activation rate rises , and fig 14 indicates that at least some of the host galaxies uncovered in the present study should be capable of producing quasars with @xmath102 if observed while accreting at the eddington limit .",
    "one prediction of this scenario is that , as a larger fraction of massive black holes become more efficiently fueled , the apparent mass difference between rlq and rqq hosts should grow with increasing redshift .",
    "the reason for this is that , if fueling rates are , on average , somewhat higher at high redshift we can expect optically selected qsos of a given luminosity to be produced by black holes with , on average , lower masses than at low redshift .",
    "however , if the @xmath103 mass threshold for powerful radio activity found in this study continues to apply at high redshift , then radio selection will continue to yield only the most massive black holes residing ( presumably ) in the most massive spheroids .",
    "in fact , studies of the hosts of rlqs and rqqs out to @xmath96 are already uncovering evidence of just such a trend .",
    "specifically , kukula et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have used nicmos on the hst to measure the rest - frame @xmath0-band luminosities of the hosts of matched samples of rlqs and rqqs at @xmath104 and @xmath96 .",
    "kukula et al .",
    "find that the hosts of rlqs are essentially unchanged in mass over this redshift range , suggesting that the minimum mass threshold for powerful radio emission indicated by the upper locus in fig 15 applies at all redshifts and is therefore of physical significance .",
    "however , they also find that the average ratio of rlq : rqq host luminosity rises from the value of @xmath105 found here at @xmath106 , to @xmath61 at @xmath104 , and @xmath107 at @xmath96 , suggesting a progressive drop in the average mass of rqq hosts with increasing redshift , a finding supported by the results of other recent studies ( ridgway et al .",
    "2000 , rix et al .",
    "in this paper we have reported the extensive results which follow from completion of our hst imaging programme of the host galaxies of low - redshift radio - quiet quasars , radio - loud quasars , and radio galaxies .",
    "this paper represents the completion of a programme which has spanned most of the last decade , commencing with the deep infrared imaging of the same sample of objects by dunlop et al .",
    "the depth and quality of our hst data have now allowed us to determine accurately all the basic structural parameters of the hosts of these 3 classes of powerful agn .",
    "because of this , and because of the wealth of data now available for this sample at other wavelengths ( including the new deep vla observations also reported here ) , we have been able to address a wide range of issues of which are hopefully of interest to workers in several different areas of extra - galactic research .",
    "consequently we conclude with a detailed summary of the main conclusions of this study , structured to assist the interested reader in moving directly to the sections which may be of most relevance to their own work .      from the detailed 2-dimensional modelling of the new hst images presented here in combination with the data reported by mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) we find that ( as detailed in sections 5 and 6 ) :    * all except the two least luminous rqqs in the sample have bulge - dominated hosts , and in only 2 of the remaining 31 objects ( the rqqs 0052 + 251 and 0157 + 001 ) can we find any evidence for a significant disc component .",
    "thus both radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars live , almost universally , in elliptical galaxies . *",
    "the hosts of all three classes of powerful agn are luminous galaxies with @xmath9 , and almost always @xmath108 .",
    "the average luminosities of the rg and rlq hosts are essentially identical ( consistent with radio - loud unification ) , and equivalent to @xmath109 .",
    "the average luminosity of the rqq hosts is somewhat smaller , equivalent to @xmath110 . *",
    "the hosts of all three classes of powerful agn are large galaxies with typical half - light radii @xmath111  kpc . as with the luminosities , the average values of host - galaxy scale - length for the radio - loud sub - samples are indistinguishable , while the hosts of the rqqs are typically smaller by a modest factor ( @xmath112 ) . * the hosts of all three classes of powerful agn display a surface - brightness scalelength ( kormendy ) relation identical ( in both slope and normalization ) to that displayed by inactive",
    "massive ellipticals predominantly found in clusters .",
    "* the hosts of all three classes of powerful agn display a distribution of axial ratio which is indistinguishable to that which has been long established for normal elliptical galaxies .      from a joint analysis of the hst optical images with existing @xmath69-band images of the same sample ( dunlop et al .",
    "1993 , taylor et al .",
    "1996 , mclure , dunlop & kukula 2000 ) we find that ( as detailed in subsections 6.6 and 6.7 ) :    * the hosts of all three classes of powerful agn are red galaxies , with typical rest - frame optical - infrared colours @xmath113 .",
    "consistent with the results of nolan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , these colours are as expected from an evolved stellar population of age @xmath114  gyr , indicating that , as for quiescent massive ellipticals , the stellar mass of an agn host galaxy is dominated by a well - evolved stellar population formed at high redshift ( @xmath115 ) . * the optical - infrared colours of the rqq and rlq nuclei are statistically indistinguishable , and lie in the range @xmath116 . for the rg nuclei ,",
    "the relation between @xmath18 colour and @xmath0-band luminosity is as expected under the assumption that they all contain obscured nuclei with intrinsic optical luminosities comparable to the quasars , reddened by dust with @xmath117 .",
    "this result strongly favours unification of rgs and rlqs via orientation rather than time .      from a comparison of our results with those derived from recent studies of the ` normal ' massive galaxy population , and of low - redshift ulirgs and seyferts",
    ", we find that ( as detailed in section 7 ) :    * the bulge : disc ratio of agn hosts is a function of agn luminosity , with disc - dominated hosts dying out above the traditional quasar : seyfert boundary at @xmath118 . * in contrast to ulirgs , quasar hosts lie in a region of the fundamental plane ( as judged from the photometric projection of the fp offered by the kormendy relation ) which has been shown to be occupied by the most massive and apparently old population of ellipticals which display ` boxy ' isophotes and distinct kinematic cores .",
    "this provides a strong argument against the possibility that the @xmath10-law luminosity profiles displayed by the vast majority of the quasar hosts in our sample are the result of recent mergers between massive disc galaxies .",
    "this result also offers little support for a strong evolutionary connection between ulirgs and quasars in the low - redshift universe . * the basic structural properties of agn hosts are indistinguishable from those of inactive brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "consistent with the environmental study of mclure & dunlop ( 2000 ) , the largest host galaxies in our sample are of comparable mass to the bcgs found at the heart of abell class 1 or class 2 clusters .",
    "however , the lack of any host galaxies as massive as an abell class 4 cluster bcg is as expected given the relative rarity of such rich environments .",
    "all the evidence considered is consistent with the agn hosts being drawn , essentially at random , from the present - day massive - elliptical galaxy population .",
    "* there is no statistically - significant evidence that agn hosts display more signs of large ( kpc ) scale disturbance , or multiple nuclei than normal comparably - massive quiescent ellipticals .      combining our hst data with our new vla data , and utilising recent results on the black - hole : spheroid mass relation in both quiescent and active galaxies",
    ", we find that ( as detailed in section 8) :    * estimates of central black - hole mass for the quasars in our sample based on host - galaxy spheroid luminosity agree well with those derived from @xmath53 emission - line width by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) . for three objects",
    "the latter technique yields a much lower value , but this is as expected for a small subset of objects if the broad - line region has a predominantly disc - like structure . * based on the relation @xmath119 , we find that all the quasars in our sample are powered by a black - hole of mass @xmath120 , but that the radio - loud objects lie above an even higher mass threshold , with @xmath121 . *",
    "the most efficient rqq in our sample appears to be radiating at @xmath122% of the eddington limit , but the vast majority of these low - redshift agn are emitting at @xmath123% of the eddington limit .",
    "based on these calculations , the most massive objects in this low - redshift sample appear capable ( if fuelled at maximum efficiency ) of producing quasars with @xmath102 , comparable to the most luminous objects known at high redshift . *",
    "the black - hole mass difference between rlqs and rqqs reflects the existence an apparent upper and lower limit to the radio output that can be produced by a black hole of a given mass .",
    "both the upper and lower thresholds on radio luminosity appear to be a strong function of black mass ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "at least some rqqs in our sample appear to be as radio - weak as ` normal ' inactive comparably - massive spheroids found in the low - redshift universe , despite the fact that must be receiving sufficient fuel to power the optical quasar nucleus . * while there is a broad and clear trend for increasing radio luminosity with increasing black - hole mass , it is now clear that host morphology , black - hole mass , and fuel supply can each be excluded as the primary physical explanation of why a subset of quasars are up to 4 orders of magnitude more radio luminous than their ` radio - quiet ' counterparts",
    ". consequently we argue that black - hole spin is the most plausible ( perhaps only ) remaining feasible explanation for the production of a powerful radio source .      considering the implications of our results for our understanding of the nature and evolution of agn populations as a function of redshift",
    ", we find that ( as detailed in section 9 ) :    * the relative numbers of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars can be naturally explained by the above - mentioned mass thresholds , combined with the form of the bright end of the elliptical galaxy luminosity function .",
    "* the activation fraction of massive black holes is @xmath6% in the present - day universe , rising to @xmath16% at @xmath125 , corresponding to the peak epoch of quasar activity in the universe . * the black - hole mass threshold for powerful radio activity can explain the trend for a growing gap with increasing redshift between the masses of rlq hosts and rqq hosts uncovered by recent hst - based studies of high redshift quasars .",
