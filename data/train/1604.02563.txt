    "ultracold gases loaded in optical lattices are an ideal tool for studying competing phases of quantum matter . engineering the effective potential seen by the atoms using light beams",
    "allows to realize with optical lattices simple models of condensed matter , particle physics and even biological systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the realization of these models in experiments would aid in the development of applications towards quantum information processing ( qip ) and the development of novel quantum materials via quantum simulation  @xcite .",
    "typically , one can realize effective hamiltonians which contain short - range physical processes such as tunneling between neighbor lattice sites and on - site interactions according to a prescribed lattice potential engineered by classical light fields , such as the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model .",
    "long range interactions are experimentally challenging but accessible in principle via polar molecules  @xcite or rydberg atoms  @xcite . however , the nature of the interaction is fixed by the characteristics of its constituents . in addition , finite range interactions by other approaches of light - matter interactions  @xcite , and extended bose - hubbard models via dipolar interactions  @xcite are also possible .",
    "in contrast to the above , loading an optical lattice inside a cavity allows to engineer effective synthetic many - body interactions between light induced atomic modes with an arbitrary spatial profile  @xcite .",
    "these interactions are mediated by the light field and do not depend on the nature of the atoms considered , making them extremely tunable and suitable for realizing quantum simulations of effective many - body long - range hamiltonians . in principle",
    "fermionic , bosonic , molecular systems , etc . can be studied .",
    "this allows to explore the interplay between additional non - conventional quantum many - body phases , besides from the typical superfluid ( sf ) and mott - insulator ( mi ) .",
    "it is now experimentally possible to access the regime where light - matter coupling is strong enough with cavity decay rates of mhz  @xcite and khz  @xcite , in the range to compete with typical short - range processes ( tunneling and on - site interactions ) .",
    "moreover , bosonic ultracold atoms loaded in an optical lattice inside an optical cavity have been recently realized  @xcite , opening a new venue to analyse the interplay between competing orders of quantum matter by design .",
    "the light inside the cavity can be used to control the formation of many - body phases of matter even in a single cavity mode by properly choosing the arrangement of the cavity , optical lattice and light pumped into the system  @xcite .",
    "additional freedom can be achieved by multimode cavities or multiple cavities extending the possibilities to condense into exotic quantum phases even further  @xcite .",
    "recent advances  @xcite , will enable the experimental realization of synthetic interactions by design with additional freedom in the near future .",
    "this can be realized as the cavity parameters ( decay rates ) and detunnings with respect the cavity modes can be externally modified with respect to the atomic system .",
    "moreover , the spatial profile of the cavity modes can be designed depending on the geometry of the coherent light beams pumped into the high - q cavity  @xcite .     and",
    "density wave order @xmath0 of the ground state , circles denote sites @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the competition between these orders in the main text and their definition .",

    "the ground state is 4-fold degenerate for @xmath14 and 2-fold degenerate for @xmath0 .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in this article we present how different arrangements involving multiple probes and/or multiple light modes configurations , lead to the competition of atypical quantum many - body phases via synthetic interactions . in the past , single cavity competition between typical sf and mi phases  @xcite , density wave orders  @xcite , and disorder  @xcite has been addressed .",
    "in contrast to other works , here we consider the interplay with what we call `` bond order '' and other orders in the system . bond order is a form of self - organization  @xcite of matter - wave coherences or  bonds \" due to cavity backaction to compensate for the phase difference imposed by the pattern of light pumped into the cavity and scattered by the atoms  @xcite . in the effective hamiltonian , as the number of cavity or pump modes increases different physics are possible due to the light induced atomic mode structure .",
    "thus , competition of quantum many - body phases triggers due to the induced atomic mode structure ( breaking symmetries , e.g. time reversal and translational ) and the regular bh hamiltonian processes ( homogenous tunnelling and on - site interactions ) .",
    "particularly difficult is the regime where strong correlations will be present in addition to the well known physics of the bh hamiltonian .",
    "this occurs when there is a large effective light - matter coupling relative to on - site interactions . in this limit ,",
    "standard mean - field theory becomes unreliable as strong imbalanced configurations can occur and large on - site fluctuations take place due to the broken symmetry of the ground state  @xcite .",
    "as the interaction has a global character with non - trivial structure , and in fact is of infinite range , symmetries are broken even in 1d .",
    "the ground state can acquire states with different competing orders , fig.[gs ] .",
    "thus , quantum phase transitions different from the usual type in 1d systems , of the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , can occur .",
    "in what follows , we analyse the system by using exact diagonalization for small number of sites in 1d .",
    "our simulations are an indicative picture of the expected behaviour in a larger system .",
    "additionally , we will study the behaviour related with the competition between between bond - order and other orders present in the system .",
    "in particular , we find numerical evidence to support the analogy between valence bond states ( vbs )  @xcite and dimerised states that arise in the cavity system due to bond ordering via different mechanisms .",
    "our results could be used as basis for the quantum simulation of analogous dimer states important in quantum magnetism  @xcite .",
    "using classical optical lattices the aklt hamiltonian can be implemented in principle as the large interaction limit of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "non - trivial entanglement properties have been found  @xcite , while bulk - boundary duality with entangled pair states occurs  @xcite and spin glasses are also possible  @xcite .",
    "the states are potentially useful for measurement based quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "other ultracold systems where the possibility of bond ordered states has been explored include dipolar gases with nearest neighbour and truncated finite range density interactions@xcite , in the framework of the so - called extended bose - hubbard models  @xcite .",
    "bond order can also occur via density dependent frustration of the hopping amplitudes with raman assisted tunelling  @xcite .",
    "moreover in condensed matter systems , bond order was first explored in low dimensions via extended hubbard models with two species fermions  @xcite .    in our treatment , we provide an alternative route to explore physics of this kind using cavity fields that relaxes the constraint on very strong on - site interaction ( @xmath15 ) , as cavity coupling can be tailored to simulate effective hamiltonians with similar properties .",
    "in ultracold atoms in the fermionic version of our system , a closer analogy to investigate and simulate resonance valence bond ( rvb ) states important in high - tc superconductivity  @xcite , might be possible .",
    "moreover , the competition between superconductivity and density wave orders is actively studied  @xcite , and light induced superconductivity is being researched  @xcite .",
    "we analyse the emergence and competition between superfluid , supersolid , insulating and dimerised quantum many - body phases of matter by means of the behaviour in their order parameters",
    ".    our findings , will foster the study of competing orders in multicomponent optomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interplay of the quantum phases we study and their generalization , may appear in hybrid system networks  @xcite . in connection to our work ,",
    "non interacting fermions in cavity systems have been studied @xcite and even chiral states have been found  @xcite . towards quantum state engineering via measurement",
    "back - action , competition with other correlated quantum many - body states  @xcite and non - hermitian dynamics  @xcite can occur .",
    "moreover , feedback control  @xcite can also be explored in relation to the dynamical stabilization of quantum many - body phases . as such",
    ", the behaviour of the emergent phases in the cavity system we will show , might aid towards the design of novel quantum materials with analogous properties .",
    "it follows , that the use of the mechanisms described here could be incorporated in the future development of real materials and composite devices in hybrid solid state systems  @xcite , where both light and matter are in the quantum limit and quantum coherence can be exploited .",
    "the article has the structure that follows .",
    "we introduce the general model of ultracold atoms in high - q cavity(ies ) where the atoms are in the regime of quantum degeneracy .",
    "we continue by stating the effective models we will consider due to synthetic interactions between light induced atomic spatial modes .",

    "the scattered light from the ultracold atoms in the ol is selected and coupling is enhanced by the optical cavity(ies ) , generating a quantum potential .",
    "the light pumped into the system has amplitude(s ) @xmath23 ( in units of the rabi frequency ) .",
    "the pump - cavity detunnings are @xmath24 .",
    "the light is pumped from the side of the main axis of the high - q cavity(ies ) , at an angle not necessarily at @xmath25 which allows for arbitrary control of the overlap of light induced spatial modes  @xcite .",

    "the light - matter hamiltonian describing the system after the light - field has been adiabatically eliminated  @xcite in the good cavity limit ( @xmath28 ) is : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the regular bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath31 with @xmath32 the nearest neighbour tunneling amplitude , @xmath15 the on - site interaction and @xmath33 the chemical potential .",

    "the couplings @xmath44 , correspond to the possible values of @xmath45 ( wannier overlap integrals )  @xcite for each mode of the cavity system through the inter - site amplitudes , labeled @xmath46 , or through the site density , labeled @xmath47 .",

    "the atoms that belong to a particular light - induced atomic mode scatter light with the same phase .",

    "the current effective model disregards additional density dependent wannier functions modified dynamically by light , which are difficult to calculate self - consistently .",
    "however the proper redefinition and self - consistent determination of these functions wo nt alter the essential structure of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this will only renormalise the effective coupling strengths and parameters of the bose hubbard model .",

    "in this section we will analyse the results from simulations performed using the effective hamiltonian ( [ jdjbh ] ) .    at integer filling @xmath164 ,",
    "the simplest case to understand is when there is only density coupling ( @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) , as the density wave instability forms for negative @xmath67 .",
    "the system in addition to sf and mi states is able to support the emergence of dw insulator and ss phases , see fig.[jbjd1 ] ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "the sf and mi exist for @xmath184 while the transition point shifts to higher values of @xmath70 as @xmath185 and smaller values for @xmath186 , compared to the system without cavity light .",
    "this occurs as on - site fluctuations are enhanced because light scatters minimally being a quantum optical lattice effect , not recoverable by simple mean - field analysis as corrections must be included  @xcite .once @xmath187 , the system has a discontinuous transition to the dw insulator state . while increasing the effective tunneling , the system goes from dw through ss to sf smoothly",
    "this can be seen in the behaviour of @xmath175 and @xmath0 , fig.[jbjd1](g ) .",
    "the insulating character of the mi is confirmed by the absence of string order parameter @xmath188 away from the dw order phases , while having @xmath189 , fig.[jbjd1](d ) , while the onsite fluctuations are also minimal fig.[jbjd1](j ) .        .    when only dimer coupling occurs ( @xmath190 , @xmath191 ) , the system for strong on - site interactions @xmath192 supports dw for @xmath193 and for @xmath194 bi+dw states .",
    "for @xmath195 , the system evolves from dw to sf via an intermediate sfd phase as tunneling increases .",
    "as @xmath196 the system goes from the bi+dw state the sf phase as @xmath70 increases rather sharply , fig.[jbjd1](h ) .",
    "complementarily , fig.[jbjd1](e ) , @xmath197 is different from zero as sfd and bi+dw phases emerge .",
    "we have that @xmath198 and @xmath161 , thus a bi+dw , a coexisting bond insulating with density wave insulating phase .",
    "this state is different from a ssd state as there is no sf component ( the state is gapped ) , and it is neither a mi , neither a hi .",
    "summarising , the transitions from the insulating phases towards the sf state are sharp for @xmath195 and continuous for @xmath194 .",
    "the @xmath199 smoothly decreases to zero as dw is approached for @xmath200 , while there is sharp change as @xmath201 in the bi+dw phase , where @xmath160 .",
    "we consider this as numerical evidence to support that the bi+dw phase is analogous to a gapped vbs state .",
    "the analogy between dimer states in the cavity system and vbs states can be traced back to the relationship between spin operators and bosonic operators via the schwinger mapping  @xcite .",
    "thus , the bond operators with alternating sign coupling in the bosonic system induce an analogous staggered field interaction .",
    "however , typically in spin systems interactions are of local character .",
    "in contrast to this , our interactions are global but not trivial , as they are structured .",
    "this produces a similar mechanism for the formation of an anti - ferromagnetic like state .",
    "however , as we are considering soft - core bosons the analogy is not complete to spins .",
    "the dimers in the system are similar to the typical spin singlets of the original vbs  @xcite .",
    "the typical hardcore bosonic representation of the bose hubbard hamiltonian ( limit @xmath202 ) via matsubara - matsuda mapping  @xcite ( @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 ) is : @xmath206 which is an anisotropic heisenberg model  @xcite while @xmath207\\right)^2\\ ] ]        now making the above contributions isotropic , only keeping the @xmath60 terms ( @xmath190 ) and at fixed particle number we have : @xmath208 ^ 2 \\label{hcl}\\ ] ] where @xmath209 . on the other hand the aktl hamiltonian  @xcite",
    "is : @xmath210 therefore , one can see ( [ hcl ] ) is a global relative to ( [ aklt ] ) from which our hamiltonian is an anisotropic relative without the hard core constraint formally . as such",
    ", some similarities might be expected between their ground states .    when density coupling and bond coupling act simultaneously ( @xmath75 and @xmath211 , with @xmath88 ) , the situation interpolates in between the above two limits .",
    "however the additional bond - density coupling terms have strong effect even for small @xmath60 .",
    "bond ordering can take over the system behaviour instead of dw order , see fig.[jbjd1](c ) , ( f ) , ( i ) and ( l ) .",
    "interestingly , for large on - site interactions ( small @xmath70 ) and @xmath186 , we find that a state with both dw and bond order occurs while being insulating , the dw does not destroy bond order .",
    "when we increase the effective tunneling for @xmath212 , the system smoothly transitions from the bi+dw state to the sf via a mixture of ssd and ss phases .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath200 and @xmath177 the system is a dw insulating state .",
    "the system transitions smoothly form this state one increases @xmath70 to the sf state via an intermediate sfd phase .",
    "in general , bond order takes over and competes with dw order as the ratio @xmath213 increases for strong on - site interactions while smoothly transitioning to the sf state as @xmath70 increases via ssd and ss ( @xmath186 ) and superfluid dimer phases sfd ( @xmath185 ) . in the current parameter range",
    "explored there is no indication of a hi phase for @xmath164 .",
    "the phase diagram of the above cases is shown in fig.[pdrho1 ] .        .",
    "it follows to consider the emergent phases at the half filled case ( @xmath179 ) . in the system without cavity light , we only have sf phase as there is no gap in the excitation spectra due to incommensuration for the homogenous system . however , even when @xmath183 and @xmath211 , the induced symmetry breaking by light will foster the formation of insulators with broken translational and time reversal symmetry . as function of the effective light matter strength for @xmath192",

    "surprisingly , even with only density coupling , bond ordered phases arise in the large @xmath15 limit .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that the one - body reduced density matrix has the structure where maximal amplitude mw coherence occurs in this case .",
    "this is a consequence of minimising the dw order and the fact that there is incommensuration .",
    "bond coupling ( @xmath191 and @xmath190 ) at @xmath179 has the effect of stabilising dw ordered phases ( dw and ss ) when @xmath195 . in contrast , the system supports bi+dw phases for @xmath194 and strong on - site interactions . even at incommensurate fillings , and addressing through the bonds , the effect of cavity light is a suppression effect upon the sf component .",
    "this leads to have a sharp transition from the bi+dw phase to the sf state for @xmath215 , fig.[jbjd05mm](b ) . for @xmath193 , the transition from the dw insulator to the sf state",
    "is smoothly connected via ss and later a sfd phase , fig.[jbjd05mm](e ) .",
    "similar to the case with only bond coupling , bond ordered phases take over in the case of simultaneous addressing ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , density coupling stabilises dw order , while bi+dw phases disappear for @xmath212.the dw insulator takes over .",
    "the large @xmath70 limit phase for @xmath216 is a ss and not a homogenous sf , fig.[jbjd05mm](c).the opposite effect occurs in the limit of @xmath217 , where instead dw ordered phases are strongly suppressed . the state of the system changes from bi+dw to sf via an intermediate sfd phase , fig.[jbjd05mm](f ) .",
