    "in the last few years there has been a growing interest in the study of the nucleation process of quark matter ( qm ) in the core of massive neutron stars . in particular , it has been shown @xcite that above a threshold value of the central pressure a pure hadronic compact star ( hs ) is metastable to the decay ( conversion ) to a quark star ( qs ) ( _ i.e. _ to a hybrid neutron star or to a strange star @xcite , depending on the details of the equation of state ( eos ) for quark matter used to model the phase transition @xcite ) .",
    "this stellar conversion process liberates a huge amount of energy ( a few @xmath3 erg ) @xcite and it could be the energy source of some of the long gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the research reported in refs @xcite has focused on the quark deconfinement phase transition in cold ( @xmath4 ) and neutrino - free neutron stars . in this case",
    "the formation of the first drop of qm could take place solely via a quantum nucleation process .",
    "a neutron star at birth ( proto - neutron star ) is very hot ( t = 10  30 mev ) with neutrinos being still trapped in the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "subsequent neutrino diffusion causes deleptonization and heats the stellar matter to an approximately uniform entropy per baryon @xmath5 = 1  2 ( in units of the boltzmann s constant @xmath6 ) . depending on the stellar composition , during this stage neutrino escape can lead the more `` massive '' stellar configurations to the formation of a black hole @xcite .",
    "however , if the mass of the star is sufficiently small , the star will remain stable and it will cool to temperatures well below 1  mev within a cooling time @xmath7  a  few  @xmath8  s , as the neutrinos continue to carry energy away from the stellar material @xcite . thus in a proto - neutron star , the quark deconfinement phase transition will be likely triggered by a thermal nucleation process .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently high temperatures , thermal nucleation is a much more efficient process with respect to the quantum nucleation mechanism .",
    "some of the earlier studies on quark matter nucleation ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) have already dealt with thermal nucleation in hot and dense hadronic matter . in these studies , it was found that the prompt formation of a critical size drop of quark matter via thermal activation is possible above a temperature of about @xmath9 mev . as a consequence",
    ", it was inferred that pure hadronic stars are converted to quark stars within the first seconds after their birth .",
    "however , these works @xcite reported an estimate of the thermal nucleation based on `` typical '' values for the thermodynamic properties characterizing the central part of neutron stars .",
    "our main objective in this and next related works , is to establish if a newborn hadronic star ( proto - hadronic star ) could survive the early stages of its evolution without `` decaying '' to a quark star . in the present letter",
    ", we calculate the thermal nucleation rate of quark matter in hot ( @xmath10 ) and neutrino - free hadronic matter using a finite temperature eos for hadronic and quark matter .",
    "in addition , we calculate the quantum nucleation rate at finite temperature , and compare the thermal and quantum nucleation time at different temperatures and pressures characterizing the central conditions of metastable proto - hadronic compact stars .",
    "we compute the crossover temperature above which thermal nucleation dominates above the finite temperature quantum nucleation mechanism .",
    "finally we briefly discuss some consequences for the physics of proto - neutron stars .",
    "for a first - order phase transition   the conditions for phase equilibrium are given by the gibbs phase rule @xmath11 @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the gibbs energies per baryon ( average chemical potentials ) for the hadron and quark phase respectively , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) denote respectively the total ( _ i.e. , _ including leptonic contributions ) energy density , total pressure , total entropy density , and baryon number density for the hadron ( quark ) phase . above the `` transition point '' ( @xmath22 )",
    "the hadronic phase is metastable , and the stable quark phase will appear as a results of a nucleation process .",
    "small localized fluctuations in the state variables of the metastable hadronic phase will give rise to virtual drops of the stable quark phase .",
    "these fluctuation are characterized by a time scale @xmath23 s. this time scale is set by the strong interactions ( which are responsible for the deconfinement phase transition ) , and it is many orders of magnitude shorter than the typical time scale for the weak interactions . therefore quark flavor must be conserved during the deconfinement transition .",
    "we will refer to this form of deconfined matter , in which the flavor content is equal to that of the @xmath0-stable hadronic system at the same pressure and temperature , as the q*-phase .",
    "soon afterward a critical size drop of quark matter is formed , the weak interactions will have enough time to act , changing the quark flavor fraction of the deconfined droplet to lower its energy , and a droplet of @xmath0-stable quark matter is formed ( hereafter the q - phase ) .",
    "this first seed of quark matter will trigger the conversion @xcite of the pure hadronic star to a hybrid star or to a strange star .",
    "thus , pure hadronic stars with values of the central pressure larger than @xmath22 are metastable to the decay ( conversion ) to hybrid stars or to strange stars @xcite . the mean lifetime of the metastable stellar configuration is related to the time needed to nucleate the first drop of quark matter in the stellar center and depends dramatically on the value of the stellar central pressure @xcite .",
    "the main effect of finite temperature on the quantum nucleation mechanism of quark matter is to modify the energy barrier separating the quark phase from the metastable hadronic phase .",
    "this energy barrier , which represents the difference in the free energy of the system with and without a q*-matter droplet , can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of the droplet ( supposed to be spherical ) , and @xmath26 is the surface tension for the surface separating the hadron from the q*-phase .",
    "the energy barrier has a maximum at the critical radius @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "notice that we have neglected the term associated with the curvature energy , and also the terms connected with the electrostatic energy , since they are known to introduce small corrections @xcite .",
    "the value of the surface tension @xmath26 for the interface separating the quark and hadron phase is poorly known , and typically values used in the literature range within @xmath28 mev @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath26 to be temperature independent and we take @xmath30 mev @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum nucleation time @xmath31 can be straightforwardly evaluated within a semi - classical approach @xcite .",
    "first one computes , in the wkb approximation , the ground state energy @xmath32 and the oscillation frequency @xmath33 of the drop in the potential well @xmath34 .",
    "then , the probability of tunneling is given by @xmath35 \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the action under the potential barrier , which in a relativistic framework reads @xmath37[u({\\cal r})-e ] }     \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] being @xmath38 the classical turning points and @xmath39 the droplet effective mass .",
    "the quantum nucleation time is then equal to @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the number of nucleation centers expected in the innermost part ( @xmath42 m ) of the hadronic star , where the pressure and temperature can be considered constant and equal to their central values .",
    "the thermal nucleation rate can be written @xcite as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the so - called dynamical prefactor , which is related to the growth rate of the drop radius @xmath45 near the critical radius ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the so - called statistical prefactor , which measures the phase - space volume of the saddle - point region around @xmath46 , and @xmath48 is the activation energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the change in the free energy of the system required to activate the formation of a critical size droplet .",
    "the langer theory @xcite of homogeneous nucleation has been extended in refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of first order phase transitions occurring in relativistic systems , as in the case of the quark deconfinement transition .",
    "the statistical prefactor , can be written @xcite as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the quark correlation length , which gives a measure of the thickness of the interface layer between the two phases ( the droplet `` surface thickness '' ) . in the present calculation",
    "we take @xmath51  fm according to the estimate given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the dynamical prefactor we have used a general expression which has been derived by venugopalan and vischer @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath52   \\",
    ",   , \\label{eq : kappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the difference between the enthalpy density of the two phases , @xmath54 the thermal conductivity , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the shear and bulk viscosities respectively of hadronic matter .",
    "notice that the nucleation prefactor used in the present work differs significantly from the one used in previous works @xcite ) where , based on dimensional grounds , the prefactor was taken to be equal to @xmath57 .",
    "there are not many calculations of the transport properties of dense hadronic matter . with a few exceptions ( see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ) , most of them are relative to nuclear or pure neutron matter @xcite .",
    "these quantities have been calculated by danielewicz @xcite in the case of nuclear matter . according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the dominant contribution to the prefactor @xmath44 comes from the shear viscosity @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath54 and @xmath56 equal to zero , and we use for the shear viscosity the following relation @xcite : @xmath58 with @xmath59  @xmath60 being the saturation density of normal nuclear matter .    the thermal nucleation time @xmath61 , relative to the innermost stellar region ( @xmath62 ) where almost constant pressure and temperature occur , can thus be written as @xmath63 .",
    "over the last decade , it has been realized that strong interacting matter at high density and low temperature may possess a large assortment of phases .",
    "different possible patterns for color superconductivity have been conjectured ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein quoted ) . very recently",
    ", a new phase of qcd , named quarkyonic phase , has been predicted @xcite .",
    "this hypothetical matter phase is characterized by chiral symmetry and confinement @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have adopted a more traditional view , assuming a single first order phase transition between the confined ( hadronic ) and deconfined phase of dense matter , and we have used rather common models for describing them . for the hadronic phase we have used models which are based on a relativistic lagrangian of hadrons interacting via the exchange of @xmath26 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 mesons .",
    "we have used one of the parameters sets given in ref .",
    "@xcite : hereafter we refer to this model as the gm1 equation of state . for the quark phase",
    "we have adopted a phenomenological eos @xcite which is based on the mit bag model for hadrons . in this work ,",
    "we have used the following set of parameters : @xmath66 , @xmath67 mev for the masses of the _ up _ , _ down _ and _ strange _ quark respectively , @xmath68 mev/@xmath69 for the bag constant , and @xmath70 for the qcd structure constant .",
    "the two models for the eos have been generalized to the case of finite temperature .",
    "1 we plot the gibbs energies per baryon for the hadron - phase and the q*-phase at different temperatures , t = 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 mev ; lines with the larger slope refer to the hadron - phase .",
    "as we see , the transition pressure @xmath22 ( indicated by a full dot ) decreases when the hadronic matter temperature is increased .",
    "the phase equilibrium curve @xmath71 for the hadron - quark phase transition ( within the present schematic model for the eos ) is shown in fig .",
    "as it is well known , for a first - order phase transition the derivative @xmath72 is related to the specific ( _ i.e. _ per baryon ) latent heat @xmath73 of the phase transition by the clapeyron - clausius equation @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) denote respectively the enthalpy per baryon and entropy per baryon for the hadron ( quark ) phase .",
    "the specific latent heat @xmath73 and the phase numbers densities @xmath80 and @xmath81 at phase equilibrium are reported in table 1 . as expected for a first order phase transition one",
    "has a discontinuity jump in the phase number densities : in our particular case @xmath82 .",
    "this result , together with the positive value of @xmath73 ( _ i.e. _ the deconfinement phase transition absorbs heat ) tell us ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq10 ] ) ) , that the transition temperature decreases with pressure ( as in the melting of ice ) .",
    ".the specific latent heat @xmath73 and the phase numbers densities @xmath80 and @xmath81 at phase equilibrium . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , in this work we have studied the quark deconfinement phase transition in hot @xmath0-stable hadronic matter , and we have explored some of its consequences for the physics of neutron stars at birth .",
    "our main finding is that proto - hadronic stars with a mass lower that the critical value @xmath1 could survive the early stages of their evolution without decaying to a quark star .",
    "however , the prompt formation of a critical size drop of quark matter could take place when @xmath83 .",
    "these proto - hadronic stars evolve to cold and deleptonized quark stars , or collapse to a black holes .",
    "finally , if quark matter nucleation occurs during post - bounce stage of core - collapse supernova , then the quark deconfinement phase transition could trigger a delayed supernova explosion characterised by a peculiar neutrino signal @xcite .",
