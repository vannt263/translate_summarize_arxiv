    "dynamical systems methods have been used for over 20 years for studying the behavior of different models in general relativity , especially in the field of cosmology , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the dynamical systems approach constitute a powerful tool when one wants to study asymptotic and intermediate behavior .",
    "it allows one to obtain a good understanding of the models even though it may be impossible to solve the corresponding equations exactly .",
    "most of the attractors in the cosmological context have turned out to be self - similar solutions but there are also more exotic ones , e.g. the mixmaster attractor . in this article",
    "we will apply the dynamical systems approach to the stationary bianchi type ii models .",
    "it will be shown that the locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) models are not asymptotically self - similar for small values of the independent variable . instead",
    "the attractor is described by a heteroclinic cycle . to our knowledge , the stationary lrs type ii models yield the simplest example of a non - self - similar attractor in general relativity .",
    "we will consider bianchi type ii models which admit a simply transitive group of isometries acting on 3-dimensional hypersurfaces which are timelike .",
    "the line element can be written as @xmath0 where the @xmath1 s are the 1-forms ^0 = d_1(x)(dt+cydz )  , ^1=dx  , ^2 = d_2(x)dy  , ^3 = d_3(x)dz  , and @xmath2 .",

    "an equation of state of the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 is also assumed .",

    "the system of differential equations admits an increasing monotone function @xmath32 in the interior phase space , excluding the point @xmath27 where @xmath32 takes its maximum value ( this monotone function has been found by using the hamiltonian methods developed in chapter 10 in @xcite ) .",

    "all other non - lrs orbits start at the kasner circle , @xmath26 , and spiral around this orbit towards @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the lrs heteroclinic cycle is no longer an attractor .",
    "instead it describes the intermediate behavior of those orbits which come `` close '' to it .",
    "so far we have only discussed the mathematical features of the stationary type ii models . however , they might also be of some physical interest .",
    "wainwright has speculated that the solution corresponding to the equilibrium point @xmath27 might be interpreted as an approximation to the interior of a rotating disc of matter @xcite .",
    "this interpretation should also pertain to the non - self - similar lrs models and perhaps also to the non - lrs models since they asymptotically approach @xmath27 .",
    "however , the main importance of the present models is probably as part of a bigger picture where they may act as building blocks .",
    "the phase space of the present models form part of the boundary of more general stationary bianchi models and hypersurface self - similar models ( see @xcite ) . these models in turn form part of the boundary of more general models like the physically interesting @xmath35-models , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "when studying these models one thus have to be observant of the behavior associated with the present heteroclinic cycle which could be expected to describe asymptotic or intermediate oscillating spatial behavior .",
    "cu is supported by the swedish natural science research council .",

    "setting @xmath37 yields the self - similar solution of @xcite .",
