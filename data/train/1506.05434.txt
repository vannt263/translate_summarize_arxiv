    "strongly interacting magnetized matter may be produced in non central relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite and may also be present in magnetars @xcite reaching up about to @xmath3 and @xmath4 in each of these two physical situations .",
    "as far as heavy ion - collisions are concerned the presence of a strong magnetic field most certainly plays a role despite the fact that , in principle , the field intensity should decrease very rapidly lasting for about 1 - 2 fm / c only @xcite . the possibility that this short time interval may @xcite or may not @xcite be affected by conductivity remains under dispute .",
    "a striking property expected to occur in such extreme conditions is the so called magnetic catalysis ( mc ) phenomenon @xcite , which implies that the order parameter for the chiral transition represented by the quark - antiquark condensate rises as the field becomes more intense ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is then natural to ask how the expected quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) transitions are affected by the presence of intense magnetic fields , a question which has been addressed in many recent works ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for an updated discussion ) . to summarize the main results obtained in these investigations let us start by recalling that at finite temperatures and vanishing chemical potential both , model approximations @xcite and lattice qcd ( lqcd ) evaluations @xcite agree that a cross over , which is predicted to occur in the the absence of magnetic fields @xcite , persists when strong magnetic fields are present .",
    "however , a source of disagreement between recent lqcd evaluations @xcite and model predictions regards the behavior of the pseudocritical temperature ( @xmath5 ) , at which the cross over takes place , as a function of the magnetic field intensity .",
    "the lqcd simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , performed with @xmath6 quark flavors and physical pion mass values , predict that @xmath5 should decrease with @xmath1 while early model evaluations predict an increase ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this problem has been recently addressed by different groups @xcite which basically agree that the different results stem from the fact that most effective models miss back reaction effects ( the indirect interaction of gluons and @xmath1 ) as well as the qcd asymptotic freedom phenomenon . on the other hand ,",
    "lqcd results are currently unavailable at high densities and low temperatures so that one has to rely in model approximations @xcite which predict that the first order chiral transition takes place at a coexistence chemical potential value which is lower than the one observed for the case of unmagnetized matter leading to the phenomenon called inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a physically intuitive discussion of the imc phenomenon ) .",
    "further investigations performed with the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) have been carried out to locate the critical end point ( cp ) as well as the coexistent chemical potentials associated with the first order chiral transition @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the size of first order transition line increases as the field becomes stronger affecting the position of the ( second order ) cp where the first order transition line terminates . at the same time",
    ", the size and location of the coexistence region in the presence of a magnetic field appears to oscillate around the @xmath7 values @xcite .",
    "together , all these effects have interesting consequences for quantities which depend on the details of the coexistence region such as the surface tension and may have consequences for studies related to the properties of magnetized compact stellar objects @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the present investigation stems from an early work by ebert and collaborators @xcite who recognized that the mc phenomenon , associated to the filling of landau levels , could lead to more exotic phase transition patterns as a consequence of the induced magnetic oscillations . to confirm this assumption",
    "these authors have considered a wide range of the ( scalar ) coupling values for the two flavor njl model at vanishing temperatures and , as expected , have observed unusual phase structures as a function of the chemical potential such as an infinite number of massless chirally symmetric phases , a cascade of massive phases with broken chiral invariance among other features .",
    "more recently , this seminal study has been extended by a more systematic , and numerically accurate analysis with two and three flavors in refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the results confirm that for certain model parametrizations one is able to observe more than one first order phase transition , which is signaled when the thermodynamical potential develops two degenerate minima at different values of the coexistence chemical potential .",
    "d gross - neveu model @xcite . ]",
    "it is important to remark that , in general , _ weak _ first order transitions can be easily missed in a numerical evaluation due to the fact that the two degenerate minima appear almost at the same location being separated by a tiny potential barrier so that their study requires extra care .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a situation where two different ( but almost identical ) densities coexist at the same chemical potential , temperature and pressure . here",
    ", one of our goals is to extend the investigation of these cascades of first order phase transitions , observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , when _ hot _ magnetized quark matter is subject to the presence of a repulsive vector channel parametrized by @xmath0 .",
    "this type of interaction provides a saturation mechanism similar to those found in effective nuclear models @xcite and is known to be important for an accurate description of quark matter at high baryonic densities @xcite .",
    "as we have verified in a previous work @xcite , the repulsive vector coupling modifies the magnetic effects mainly at lower temperatures and plays an opposite role compared to @xmath1 in the qcd phase diagram . as a matter of fact , the increase of the magnetic field shifts the first order transition to lower values of the coexistence chemical potential while a nonzero vector repulsion produces the reverse effect .",
    "this feature has also been recently verified within the three flavor case @xcite in the analysis of compact stellar objects . here",
    ", we shall see that the presence of a vector repulsion allows for further interesting possibilities associated with the chiral first order transition due to the fact that this term can stabilize intermediary density magnetic phases .",
    "being carried out at finite temperatures the present investigation also allows for a more complete description of the coexistence region and makes it possible to better understand the physical nature of the associated phase transitions . as a first novelty we show that within a cascade of the transitions the one which takes place at the highest pressure value seems to be reminiscent of the  solid - liquid \" type of transition displayed by the phase diagram of water while the others are of the usual  liquid - gas \" type ( commonly observed within qcd effective theories ) . motivated by the fact that the lennard - jones potential , which describes water , also has a repulsive part we have scanned over the @xmath0 values to search for any eventual triple point in the phase diagram of magnetized quark matter since this situation can not be completely ruled out in the scenario considered here .",
    "the reason is that the presence of a magnetic field induces the free energy to develop multiple minima while the repulsive interaction favors stability so that eventually three ( instead of the usual two ) minima could be globally degenerate leading to the coexistence of three phases .",
    "as we shall demonstrate the numerical results have confirmed our expectations so that for very particular , but yet realistic , parameter values the phase diagram of strongly interacting magnetized quark matter may indeed display triple points .    the work is organized as follows . in the next section we present the free energy in the presence of a repulsive vector channel for the magnetized njl model within the mean field approximation ( mfa ) framework . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss how a cascade of the usual type of first order phase transitions , with two degenerate minima , takes place at finite temperatures . in the same section",
    "we extend the analysis to the finite temperature domain in order to draw the phase diagrams in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 planes .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of unusual first order phase transitions where the free energy develops more than two degenerate minima allowing for the existence of triple points .",
    "our conclusions and final remarks are presented in sec . v.",
    "the qcd interaction between quarks can be effectively described by the well - known njl theory @xcite which reproduces , at lower energies , the main features of chiral symmetry breaking . in the usual two flavor version",
    "the same coupling constant , @xmath10 , sets the interaction strength in both the scalar and pseudo - scalar channels .",
    "however , in finite density investigations the model produces more realistic results if an additional repulsive vector channel , parametrized by @xmath0 , is introduced . in this case",

    "then , in the case of symmetric quark matter ( @xmath16 ) the theory is described by @xmath17 where the effective quark mass , @xmath18 , and the effective chemical potential , @xmath19 , are determined upon applying the corresponding minimization conditions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "therefore , at the present stage the vector coupling @xmath0 is usually taken to be a free parameter whose accepted values lie within the range @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "it is worth to point out that the explicit use of @xmath0 within the njl model can be avoided provided that the evaluations be performed beyond the large-@xmath83 ( or mfa ) level . in this case two loop ( exchange like )",
    "terms bring finite @xmath83 corrections to the pressure such as @xmath84 so that the same type of physics can be observed with one less parameter @xcite .",
    "within the usual first order transition scenario the free energy develops a pair of degenerate global minima defining two distinct values for the effective quark masses as well as for the quark number density . usually , when @xmath7 , only one first order chiral transition takes place so that , for a given temperature , a unique value for the coexistence chemical potential exists .",
    "however , as already emphasized , the presence of a magnetic field causes an oscillatory behavior which may induce more exotic patterns like the appearance of a cascade of first order transitions such as the ones studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where only the case of vanishing temperatures , in the absence of repulsion , has been considered .",
    "one of the main outcomes of these applications is that , for some phenomenologically acceptable parametrizations , several transitions are needed to move from the vacuum phase to the ( approximately ) chirally symmetric phase .",
