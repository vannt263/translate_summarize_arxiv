    "a high - energy muon collider ( mc ) is envisaged to be an ideal environment for performing precision measurements in the multi - tev regime .",
    "one major advantage is its sharply defined collision energy , which is only mildly distorted by initial - state radiation , while the influence of beamstrahlung can be completely neglected for most purposes @xcite .",
    "however , the design of the detector and beam - delivery system will have to account for the large flux of electrons from muon decay inside the beam pipe .",
    "the detector can be protected from these decay electrons by installing cone - shaped tungsten shields around the beam pipe near the interaction point .",
    "nevertheless , low - energy secondaries produced in the shielding material may still penetrate the detector , leading to large occupancy values in the inner detector elements .",
    "simulations show that this background can be reduced to acceptable levels by using high - resolution timing information ( since secondary particle showers will arrive in the detector with some time delay ) and sufficiently massive shielding around the beam pipe",
    ".    however , the absence of instrumentation inside the shielding cones leads to reduced angular coverage of the detector , which can affect the effectiveness of new physics searches and measurements .",
    "in particular , physics signatures with missing energy can receive large backgrounds from photon - photon interactions ref .",

    "note that these errors are quite comparable to what one would obtain with an ilc - like detector and _ without _ the additional cut : , .",
    "this seemingly counter - intuitive outcome follows from the fact the mass errors are dominated by the fit of the lower endpoint , whereas the cut , in combination with  , primarily removes signal events with larger value of @xmath36 .",

    "this approach also allows one to drop the cut , which is only helpful for improving the signal - to - background ratio at lower energies .    using simulated events for @xmath45  gev and @xmath46  gev , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath23 each , and fitting the upper endpoints of the lepton energy distributions after cuts ",

    "@xmath47 for selectron production , due to the smaller cross section , one obtains somewhat larger errors : @xmath48 it is important , however , to note that this analysis strategy is very robust , since the upper endpoint of the @xmath37 spectrum from @xmath49 production is essentially background - free and thus there are no systematic uncertainties from the background simulation and subtraction .",
    "in the previous section , a scenario with a relatively large mass difference @xmath50 was considered . for smaller mass differences , which are expected in co - annihilation scenarios ,",
    "the final - state lepton energy spectrum becomes softer .",
    "for sufficiently small values of @xmath51 , the upper endpoint @xmath31 can thus lie in a range with significant sm background levels . in this case",
    ", both measurement strategies described in the previous section will be affected by statistical and systematical errors of the background , and a reliable measurement will be impossible when these uncertainties become dominant .",
    "[ reachp ]    to quantify this problem one needs to define a criterion for the minimum event yield and allowable background level for the endpoint measurement . here",
    "a very simple rule is adopted , demanding that the bins of the energy spectrum near the endpoint must have a signal - to - background ratio of at least one and must contain at least 10 events per bin , for a bin width of 50  gev ( as in the figures above ) . using this criterion , the estimated reach of a 3  tev muon collider",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ reachp ] , for the three cases of an ilc - like detector , a 6@xmath24 shielding cone , and a 20@xmath24 shielding cone .",
    "the plot has been generated by interpolating between simulated results for a range of smuon and neutralino masses , applying the cuts  in each case .",
    "as evident from the figure , the reach is limited by two factors .",
    "on one hand , for smuon masses close to the beam energy the @xmath28 cross section is rather small and thus are affected by the high - energy tail of the residual sm background . on the other hand , for small mass differences @xmath52 , the signal @xmath53 spectrum becomes soft and therefore lies in a kinematic regime with large sm backgrounds . since the background level grows with increasing blind cone of the detector , the accessible parameter region is reduced in both directions for a mc , compared to a hypothetical multi - tev ilc - like collider . in particular , it will be difficult to explore co - annihilation scenarios at a mc .",
    "depending on the supersymmetry scenario , however , it may still be possible to obtain a robust @xmath3 signal in this case if the smuons are also produced in the decays of heavier superpartners .",
    "such cascade decays can lead to a distinct signal over the sm background as long as the visible decay products are sufficiently energetic , @xmath54 for the mass hierarchy @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass of the heavier superpartner .",
    "since this option is highly model - dependent , it will not be explored further here .",
    "while the endpoints of the @xmath57 spectrum are related to the slepton and neutralino masses , the shape of this distribution contains information about the slepton spin .",
    "since sleptons are scalars the @xmath57 distribution is theoretically exactly flat , although in practice the shape is slightly distorted by selection cuts .    as an alternative ,",
    "let us consider the process @xmath58 where it is assumed that the sneutrinos @xmath59 decay invisibly @xcite . in this case",
    ", the primary pair - produced particles ( the charginos @xmath60 ) are fermions . for this process",
    ", the @xmath57 distribution is not flat , but spin correlations lead to a relative accumulation of events near the lower end , see fig .  [ chap ] .    in general ,",
    "the @xmath61 production cross section is different from the @xmath28 and @xmath62 cross section , and this fact may also be employed to distinguish these processes .",
    "however , the observable production rate also depends on other model - dependent factors such as branching fractions . in this work , therefore , only the shape information of the @xmath57 distribution will be used for spin discrimination , and the signal distribution in fig .  [ chap ]",

    "however , it would still be possible to analyze slepton production and decay in such a scenario at a muon collider if one can take advantage of cascade decays of heavier superpartners into the sleptons .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the size of the blind shielding cones has only a mild influence on these results , even when comparing two extreme scenarios : a very optimistic case with a @xmath68 shielding cone , and a conservative case with a @xmath69 shielding cone .",
