    "a symbiotic binary is a system which contains a hot object accreting from an m giant companion , either from the wind of the m star or via roche lobe overflow ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1996 ) . in most symbiotic stars",
    "the accreting object is a white dwarf , and these systems can be modest x - ray emitters ( e.g. mrset et al .",
    "1997 ) . in far fewer systems is the accreting object thought to be a neutron star .",
    "there are presently only five sources for which there is strong evidence that they are `` symbiotic x - ray binaries '' with a neutron star component .",
    "this paper discusses three of these sources : gx 1 + 4 , , and 7 .",
    "gx 1 + 4 has been known as a symbiotic source containing an x - ray pulsar for some time ( e.g. davidsen et al .",
    "7  was suspected to be a symbiotic source and this is now confirmed and , which was initially thought to be a high - mass x - ray binary , has also recently been found to have an m giant counterpart ( masetti et al .",
    "in addition to these sources , sct x-1 igr j16194 - 2810 , and 1rxs j180431.1 - 273932 have also recently been suggested to be symbiotic x - ray binaries ( kaplan et al .",

    "we present an analysis of the x - ray variability of gx 1 + 4 , , and 7 using long term observations made with the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) and the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) all sky monitor ( asm ) .",
    "sct x-1 , igr j16194 - 2810 , and 1rxs j180431.1 - 273932 are not considered here as these sources were not strongly detected by the bat and asm light curves are not available for igr j16194 - 2810 and 1rxs j180431.1 - 273932 .",
    "these observations enable a study of variability on timescales from hours to years .",
    "the bat observations show the presence of a strong modulation with period of about 5 hours in , first reported by corbet et al .",
    "we consider possible mechanisms that could cause this modulation .",
    "modulation on timescales of hours is not seen in either  or 7 .",
    "we find no evidence for orbital modulation in any of these three systems .",

    "source parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "pulsations with a period of 120s from gx 1 + 4 were discovered by lewin et al .",
    "the optical counterpart was identified as the bright infrared source v2116 oph ( glass & feast 1973 ) and gx 1 + 4 was classified as a symbiotic x - ray binary containing an m giant mass donor by davidsen et al .",

    "chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) presented extensive optical , infrared , and x - ray observations of gx 1 + 4 and concluded that the binary period must be greater than 100 days , and is most likely greater than 260 days , based on the assumption that the m giant does not overfill its roche lobe .",

    "pereira et al . ( 1999 ) noted that the pulse period variations could not be attributed to orbital doppler modulation as this would require an implausibly large mass for the companion star and instead the period changes must be related to changes in the accretion torque . using infrared radial velocity measurements of the m giant , hinkle et al .",

    "( 2005 ) and the data reduction process is described by markwardt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and tueller et al .",
    "the bat is a very wide field of view ( 1.4 sr half - coded ) hard x - ray telescope that utilizes a 2.7 m@xmath1 coded - aperture mask and a 0.52 m@xmath1 cdznte detector array divided into 32,768 detectors each with an area of 0.16 cm@xmath1 .",
    "the pointing direction of the bat is determined by observations using the narrow - field xrt and uvot instruments also on board swift which are primarily used to study gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows .",
    "bat observations of x - ray sources are thus generally obtained in a serendipitous and unpredictable fashion",

    "the rxte asm ( levine et al . 1996 ) consists of three similar scanning shadow cameras which perform sets of 90 second pointed observations ( `` dwells '' ) so as to cover 80% of the sky every 90 minutes .",
    "light curves are available in three energy bands : 1.5 to 3 kev , 3 to 5 kev , and 5 to 12 kev .",
    "the crab produces approximately 75.5  in the asm over the entire energy range and 26.8 ( 1.5 to 3.0 kev ) , 23.3 ( 3 to 5 kev ) , and 25.4 ( 5 to 12 kev )  in each energy band .",
    "observations of blank field regions away from the galactic center suggest that background subtraction may produce a systematic uncertainty of about 0.1  ( remillard & levine 1997 ) .",
    "the asm light curves used in our analysis span the period from mjd 50,087 to 54,195 except for the light curve of   which starts on mjd 50,088 .",
    "the rxte asm light curves cover a longer duration than the swift bat light curves and so are better suited for searches for orbital modulation on the long time scales expected for symbiotic x - ray binaries .",
    "the bat light curves are generally more sensitive than the asm light curves , particularly for highly - absorbed sources , and so have advantages in studying variability on shorter timescales .",
    "we use power spectra of the light curves to search for periodic modulation and in all cases the calculation of power spectra employed the `` semi - weighting '' scheme discussed in corbet et al .",
    "( 2007a , b ) .    [ [ section ] ]    the asm and bat light curves of  are shown in fig . [",

    "there are also other peaks almost as strong as the peak at 270 days , which appears to be part of the general low frequency noise present in the power spectrum .    in order to estimate the amount of low frequency noise present in the spectrum and remove it we examined the relationship between the continuum power level and frequency .",
    "this was done using the logarithms of power and frequency as advocated , for example , by vaughan ( 2005 ) .",
    "it was found that a linear fit to log(power ) vs. log(frequency ) , i.e. a power - law relationship between power and frequency , underestimated the power at low frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_fits ] ) .",
    "instead it was found that a quadratic fit gave a reasonable approximation to the continuum noise level .",
    "this quadratic fit was subtracted from the logarithm of the power spectrum together with a constant of value 0.25068 in order to account for the bias due to the @xmath6 distribution of the power spectrum ( e.g. papadakis & lawrence 1993 , vaughan 2005 ) . the power spectrum corrected in this way for the `` red noise '' contribution",

    "there is a significant peak around the orbital period of rxte at 15.0185 day@xmath5 and a smaller peak close to 1 day@xmath5 which is likely related to aliasing of the strong low frequency noise with a one day sampling pattern ( see farrell , oneill & sood 2005 , wen et al .",

    "we next utilized the more sensitive bat observations to investigate higher frequency variability .",
    "this was calculated in the same way as for  with the same technique used to remove low - frequency noise .",

    "our results show that for , , and 7any accretion rate modulation caused by an eccentric orbit is much less than that caused by other mechanisms .",
    "masetti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) determined the optical counterpart of 4u 1954 + 31 to be an m 4 - 5 giant which would imply a long orbital period in order for the star not to overfill its roche lobe . for comparison ,",
    "chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) derive a constraint of p@xmath10 @xmath9 100 days for gx 1 + 4 where the donor is an m5 iii star .",
    "the 5 hour period thus can not be the orbital period of a compact object about the m star .",
    "the change in the 5 hour period can not be predominantly due to orbital doppler modulation . if this was the case from fig .",
    "[ fig:1954_period ] it can be seen that the orbital period would be @xmath11 500 days , and the velocity semi - amplitude would be @xmath11 10,000 .",
    "these values would give a huge mass function of @xmath115@xmath3 10@xmath12 m .",
    "the large change in the 5 hour period must thus be intrinsic to the source of the modulation .",
    "this makes it implausible that this 5 hour period is caused by orbital modulation which rules out triple star models .",
    "we note that the period change is also too large for the period to come from the rotation period of an accreting white dwarf because of the large moment of inertia of these objects .",
    "we therefore consider other possible models that could explain the 5 hour modulation .",
    "the 5 hour period in  is somewhat reminiscent of the 2.7 hour period seen in the high - mass x - ray binary 2s 0114 + 650 .",
    "this period was discovered by finley , belloni , & cassinelli ( 1992 ) and was proposed to be a neutron star rotation period .",
    "apparent confirmation of this interpretation comes from the continued presence of the 2.7 hour modulation in the asm light curve ( corbet et al . 1999 ; farrell et al .",
    "2006 ) which implies the modulation is rather coherent .",
    "an indirect argument for the modulations on periods of hours in both and 2s 0114 + 650 being neutron star pulsation periods is that no other periodicity has been found in these systems that could be neutron star pulsation periods .",
    "a long period of 1.6 hours has also been reported for igr j16358 - 4726 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "2003 , patel et al .",
    "however , for igr j16358 - 4726 it is not clear whether this period is a neutron star rotation period or an orbital period .",
    "a 5 hour neutron star rotation period for  would make it one of the longest known with only the 6.67 period from the point source in the supernova remnant rcw 103 exceeding this value ( de luca et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "if the periodicity in  does indeed represent the rotation period of a neutron star , then the rapid spin - up requires an x - ray luminosity of approximately 5@xmath310@xmath13  ( e.g. mason 1977 , joss & rappaport , 1984 ) .",
    "for comparison , in an earlier outburst of  masetti et al .",
    "( 2007a ) derive luminosities of 2@xmath310@xmath13 , _ not _ corrected for absorption from rxte and bepposax observations obtained on mjd 50796 and 50937 respectively .",
    "masetti et al .",
    "( 2007a ) also found the absorption to be complex and variable .",
    "the observed x - ray flux therefore appears to be consistent with that required to account for the observed spin - up .",
    "for a 5 hour rotation period , material corotating in a keplerian orbit about the neutron star would be at a radius of 10@xmath14 cm .",
    "in contrast , the magnetospheric radius , at which the magnetic field would dominate over the ram pressure , would be located at 10@xmath15 ( l@xmath16/10@xmath13)@xmath17 ( b/10@xmath18g)@xmath19 cm .",
    "the 5 hour period is thus apparently much longer than the equilibrium spin period .",
    "this appears to be similar to the case of gx 1 + 4 where the corotation radius is estimated to be 3 @xmath3 10@xmath15 cm and the magnetospheric radius is estimated to be significantly smaller at 3 @xmath3 10@xmath20 cm for a magnetic field of 10@xmath18 g ( chakrabarty & roche 1997 ) . despite this , gx 1 + 4 has primarily exhibited long - term spin - down , with occasional spin - up behavior seen in the brightest states ( e.g. chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 , ferrigno et al .",
    "2007 ) . in order to explain the spin - down in  without the need for an unusually strong magnetic field ,",
    "it has been proposed ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "1988 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 , nelson et al . 1997 ) that a counter - rotating accretion disk may sometimes form . alternatively , perna et al .",
    "( 2006 ) consider a spin - down mechanism related to the fallback of material expelled when a neutron star is in the propeller regime .    the possible detection of the 5 hour period in  with the asm was at a similar period to that seen at the start of the outburst observed with the bat .",
    "this suggests that , like , may also exhibit spin - down between outbursts that maintains the period at this length . the possibility of spin - down is also suggested by the lower flux points in fig .",
    "[ fig:1954_pdot_flux ] .",
    "the dependence of @xmath21 on flux is predicted by standard accretion models ( e.g. ghosh & lamb 1979 ) and has been seen , for example , in the hmxb exo 2030 + 375 ( parmar et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the period change results appear to suggest that  may be rotating close to its equilibrium period , and hence that the neutron star has a very large magnetic field ( @xmath2210@xmath23 g ) .",
    "however , the complex @xmath21 behavior exhibited by  indicates that caution should be taken with this interpretation ( e.g. chakrabarty et al .",
    "additional observations are needed to confirm whether  does indeed consistently show spin - down during periods of low flux and more completely quantify the @xmath21 dependence on source luminosity .",
    "the 5 hour modulation might alternatively be caused by some type of instability in the accretion flow onto the neutron star .",
    "the 5 hour timescale is similar to that of the 3.96 hour quasi - periodic flares observed on one occasion from the be / neutron star binary exo 2030 + 375 ( parmar et al . 1989 ) . as this modulation",
    "was only detected once for a brief period we have no information on whether such a modulation might exhibit long term period changes such as shown by .",
    "therefore , although this model can not yet be definitely excluded , its transient appearance in only one other source may make it a less likely explanation .",
    "the interpretation of the 2.7 hour period in 2s 0114 + 650 as a neutron star rotation period has been questioned by koenigsberger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who propose that the period comes from tidal interactions which drive oscillations in the b supergiant primary . however , an explanation of the 5 hour period in  as a pulsation in the mass donor appears problematic as the fundamental pulsation periods of m giants are very long and there is little evidence for pulsations on periods less than 10 days ( percy et al .",
    "2001 , koen et al .",
    "we therefore exclude this model as a possible explanation of the 5 hour periodicity .",
    "the persistence of the 5 hour period over an extended length of time , the change in period consistent with accretion torque , and lack of any other periodicity in the light curve that could be a pulse period , all suggest that the 5 hour period is a neutron star rotation period .",
    "however , an exo 2030 + 375 type instability is not yet completely ruled out .",
    "the three symbiotic x - ray binaries considered here show substantial x - ray variability on long time scales , dominated by the presence of slow flares . in none of the systems",
    "does the long term x - ray flux show detectable orbital modulation and there is no evidence for modulation at any of the previously reported periods .",
    "any accretion rate variations caused by modulation in an eccentric orbit appear to be much less than that which occurs during the non - periodic flares .",
    "in contrast , on shorter timescales two of the three sources ,  and , exhibit periodic modulation that appears to come from a neutron star rotation period .",
    "this , together with the pulsations shown by sct x-1 and 1rxs j180431.1 - 273932 , suggests that further observations of 7 , preferably during an outburst , might also reveal a pulsation period in this source .",
    "additional observations of  should help to better constrain the nature of the 5 hour modulation by showing whether this is a persistent feature of the light curve and , if so , how the period changes on long timescales in response to varying accretion rates .",
