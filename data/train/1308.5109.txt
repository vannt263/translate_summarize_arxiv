    "the present dama / libra @xcite experiment , as the former dama / nai @xcite , has the main aim to investigate the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the model independent dm annual modulation signature ( originally suggested in ref .",
    "moreover , the developed highly radio - pure nai(tl ) target - detectors @xcite assure sensitivity to a wide range of dm candidates , interaction types and astrophysical scenarios .    as a consequence of the earth",
    "s revolution around the sun , which is moving in the galaxy with respect to the local standard of rest towards the star vega near the constellation of hercules , the earth should be crossed by a larger flux of dm particles around @xmath19 2 june and by a smaller one around @xmath19 2 december . in the former case",
    "the earth orbital velocity is summed to the one of the solar system with respect to the galaxy , while in the latter the two velocities are subtracted .",
    "the dm annual modulation signature is very distinctive since the effect induced by dm particles must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements : the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function ( 1 ) with one year period ( 2 ) and a phase that peaks roughly @xmath19 2 june ( 3 ) ; this modulation must only be found in a well - defined low energy range , where dm particle induced events can be present ( 4 ) ; it must apply only to those events in which just one detector of many actually `` fires '' ( _ single - hit _ events ) , since the dm particle multi - interaction probability is negligible ( 5 ) ; the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be @xmath19 7% for usually adopted halo distributions ( 6 ) , but it can be larger in case of some possible scenarios such as e.g. those in ref .",
    "@xcite ( even up to @xmath19 30% ) .",
    "thus this signature is model independent , very effective and , in addition , it allows to test a large interval of cross sections and of halo densities .",
    "this dm signature might be mimiced only by systematic effects or side reactions able to account for the whole observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements given above .",
    "no one is available @xcite .",
    "the full description of the dama / libra set - up during the phase1 and other related arguments have been discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "here we just remind  as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : setup ]  that the sensitive part of this set - up is made of 25 highly radiopure nai(tl ) crystal scintillators ( 5-rows by 5-columns matrix ) having 9.70 kg mass each one . in",
    "each detector two 10 cm long uv light guides ( made of suprasil b quartz ) act also as optical windows on the two end faces of the crystal , and are coupled to two low background photomultipliers ( pmts ) working in coincidence at single photoelectron level .",
    "the low background 9265-b53/fl and 9302-a / fl pmts , developed by emi - electron tubes with dedicated r&ds , were used in the phase1 ; for details see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the detectors are housed in a sealed low - radioactive copper box installed in the center of a low - radioactive cu / pb / cd - foils / polyethylene / paraffin shield ; moreover , about 1 m concrete ( made from the gran sasso rock material ) almost fully surrounds ( mostly outside the barrack ) this passive shield , acting as a further neutron moderator .",
    "a threefold - levels sealing system prevents the detectors to be in contact with the environmental air of the underground laboratory @xcite .",
    "the light response of the detectors during phase1 typically ranges from 5.5 to 7.5 photoelectrons / kev , depending on the detector .",
    "the hardware threshold of each pmt is at single photoelectron , while a software energy threshold of 2 kev electron equivalent ( hereafter kev ) is used @xcite .",
    "energy calibration with x - rays/@xmath20 sources are regularly carried out in the same running condition down to few kev @xcite ; in particular , double coincidences due to internal x - rays from @xmath21k ( which is at ppt levels in the crystals ) provide ( when summing the data over long periods ) a calibration point at 3.2 kev close to the software energy threshold ( for details see ref .",
    "the daq system records both _ single - hit _ events ( where just one of the detectors fires ) and _ multiple - hit _ events ( where more than one detector fires ) up to the mev region despite the optimization is performed for the lowest one .",
    "the radiopurity , the procedures and details are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the data of the former dama / nai setup ( 0.29 ton @xmath0 yr ) and , later , those of the first 6 annual cycles of dama / libra ( 0.87 ton@xmath0yr ) have already given positive model independent evidence for the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo with high confidence level on the basis of the exploited dm annual modulation signature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the final model independent result of dama / libra  phase1 , obtained by including in the analysis also the data collected during the last seventh annual cycle of operation , is presented .",
    "the total exposure of dama / libra  phase1 is : 1.04 ton @xmath0 yr ; when including also that of the first generation dama / nai experiment it is @xmath2 ton @xmath0 yr , corresponding to 14 annual cycles .",

    "as it can be inferred from table [ tb : years ] , the duty cycle of the experiment is high ; the routine calibrations and , in particular , those related with the acceptance windows efficiency mainly affect it .",
    "the further improvement of the duty cycle in the last two annual cycles is mainly due to the improved performances of the new transient digitizers and daq system installed at fall 2008 before the start of the sixth annual cycle @xcite .",

    "in fact , since the probability that a dm particle interacts in more than one detector is negligible , a dm signal can be present just in the _ single - hit _ residual rate .",
    "thus , the comparison of the results of the _ single - hit _ events with those of the _ multiple - hit _",
