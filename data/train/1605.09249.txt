    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) , also known as optoacoustic tomography , is a novel non - invasive imaging technology that beneficial combines the high contrast of pure optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of pure ultrasound imaging ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic principle of pat is as follows ( compare figure  [ fig : pat ] ) .",
    "a semitransparent sample ( such as a part of a human patient ) is illuminated with short pulses of optical radiation .",
    "a fraction of the optical energy is absorbed inside the sample which causes thermal heating , expansion , and a subsequent acoustic pressure wave depending on the interior absorbing structure of the sample .",
    "the acoustic pressure is measured outside of the sample and used to reconstruct an image of the interior .     ]",
    "the standard approach in pat is to measure the acoustic pressure with small detector elements distributed on a surface outside of the sample ; see figure  [ fig : pat ] .",
    "the spatial sampling step size limits the spatial resolution of the pressure data and the ( lateral ) resolution of the final reconstruction .",
    "consequently , high spatial resolution requires a large number of detector locations .",
    "ideally , for high frame rate , the pressure data are measured in parallel with a large array made of small detector elements .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio and therefore the sensitivity decreases for smaller detector elements and producing a large array with high bandwidth is costly and difficult to fabricate .    as an alternative to the usually employed piezoelectric transducers , optical detection schemes have been used to acquire the pressure data @xcite . in these methods an optical beam is raster scanned along a surface . in case of non - contact photoacoustic imaging schemes the ultrasonic waves impinging on the sample surface change the phase of the reflected light , which is demodulated by interferometric means and a photodetector @xcite . for fabry - perot film sensors ,",
    "acoustically induced changes of the optical thickness of the sensor lead to a change in the reflectivity , which can be measured using a photo diode @xcite .",
    "equally for both techniques , the ultrasonic data are acquired at the location of the interrogation beam by recording the time - varying output of the photodetector . in order to collect sufficient data the measurement process has to be repeated with changed locations of the interrogation beam .",
    "obviously , such an approach slows down the imaging speed .",
    "the imaging speed can be increased by multiplying the number of interrogation beams .",
    "for example , for a planar fabry - perot sensor a detection scheme using 8 interrogation beams has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "another , less straight forward , approach to increase the measurement speed is the use of patterned interrogation together with compressed sensing techniques .",
    "patterned interrogation was experimentally demonstrated using a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) in @xcite .",
    "using digital micromirror devices or spatial light modulators to generate such interrogation patterns together with compressed sensing techniques allows to reduce the number of spatial measurements without significantly increasing the production costs . for such approaches ,",
    "we develop a compressed sensing scheme based sparsifying temporal transforms originally introduced for pat with integrating line detectors in  @xcite .",
    "compressed sensing ( or compressive sampling ) is a new sensing paradigm introduced recently in @xcite .",
    "it allows to capture high resolution signals using much less measurements than advised by shannon s sampling theory .",
    "the basic idea in compressed sensing is replacing point measurements by general linear measurements , where each measurement consists of a linear combination @xmath0      = \\sum_{i=1}^n { \\mathbf a}{[j , i ] }   { \\mathbf x}{[i ] }      \\quad \\textnormal { for } j =   1 , \\dots , m   \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the desired high resolution signal ( or image ) , @xmath2 the measurement vector , and @xmath3 the @xmath4 measurement matrix . if @xmath5 , then ( [ eq : cs ] ) is a severely under - determinated system of linear equations for the unknown signal .",
    "the theory of compressed sensing predicts that under suitable assumptions the unknown signal can nevertheless be stably recovered from such data .",
    "the crucial ingredients of compressed sensing are sparsity and randomness .",
    "1 .   sparsity : this refers to the requirement that the unknown signal is sparse , in the sense that it has only a small number of entries that are significantly different from zero ( possibly after a change of basis ) .",
    "2 .   randomness : this refers to selecting the entries of the measurement matrix in a certain random fashion .",
    "this guarantees that the measurement data are able to sufficiently well separate sparse vectors .    in this work we use randomness and sparsity to develop novel compressed sensing techniques for pat .     ]      in pat , temporal samples can easily be collected at a high rate compared to spatial sampling , where each sample requires a separate sensor .",
    "it is therefore natural to work with semi - discrete data @xmath6 ,   { \\ , \\cdot \\ , } ) $ ] , where @xmath7 $ ] denote locations on the detection surface .",
    "compressed sensing measurements in pat take the form ( [ eq : cs ] ) with @xmath8 }   { : = } p({\\mathbf r}_s[i ] ,   t ) $ ] for fixed time @xmath9 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : sampling ] for an illustration of classical point - wise sampling versus compressed sensing measurements . in pat",
    "it is most simple to use binary combinations of pressure values , where @xmath10}$ ] only takes two values ( states on and off ) .",
    "binary measurements can be implemented by optical detection using patterned interrogation and we restrict ourselves to such a situation .    in the pat literature , two types of binary matrices allowing compressed sensing have been proposed ( see figure  [ fig : matrices ] ) . in  @xcite scrambled hadamard matrices have been used and experimentally realized . in  @xcite expander matrices",
    "have been used , where the measurement matrix is sparse and has exactly @xmath11 ones in each column , whose locations are randomly selected .",
    "another possible choice would be a bernoulli matrix where any entry is selected randomly from two values with equal probability .",
    "in all three cases , the random nature of the selected coefficients yields compressed sensing capability of the measurement matrix ( see  [ sec : cs ] for details ) . as in @xcite",
    ", in this study we use expander matrices .",
    "for the experimental verification such measurements are implemented virtually by taking full point - measurements in the experiment and then computing compressed sensing data numerically .",
    "this can be seen as proof of principle ; implementing pattern interrogation in our contact - free photoacoustic imaging device is an important future aspect .     for more details how to construct these matrices.[fig : matrices ] ]    besides the random nature of the measurement matrix , sparsity of the signal to be recovered is the second main ingredient enabling compressed sensing . as in many other applications , sparsity",
    "often does not hold in the original domain .",
    "instead sparsity holds in a particular orthonormal basis , such as a wavelet or curvelet basis @xcite .",
    "however , such a change of basis can destroy the compressed sensing capability of the measurement matrix ( for example , in the case of expander matrices ) . in order to overcome this limitation , in @xcite we developed the concept of a sparsifying temporal transformation .",
    "such a transform applies in the temporal variable only and results in a filtered pressure signal that is sparse . because any operation acting in the temporal domain intertwines with the measurement matrix , one can apply sparse recovery to estimate the sparsified pressure .",
    "the photoacoustic source can be recovered , in a second step , by applying a standard reconstruction algorithm to the sparsified pressure .      in this paper",
    "we develop a compressed sensing scheme based on a sparsifying transform for three - dimensional pat ( see section  [ sec : cspat ] ) .",
    "this complements our work  @xcite , where we introduced the concept of sparsifying transforms for pat with integrating line detectors .",
    "wave propagation is significantly different in two and in three spatial dimensions . as a result ,",
    "the sparsifying transform proposed in this work significantly differs from the one presented in  @xcite . in  [ sec : cs ] we provide an introduction to compressed sensing serving as guideline for designing compressed sensing matrices and highlighting the role of sparsity . in section  [ sec : num ] we present numerical results on simulated as well as on experimental data from a non - contact photoacoustic imaging setup  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the number of spatial measurements can be reduced by at least a factor of 4 compared to the classical point sampling approach .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] and a short summary in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we develop a compressed sensing scheme for pat , where the acoustic signals are recorded on a planar measurement surface .",
    "the planar geometry is of particular interest since it is the naturally occurring geometry if using optical detection schemes like the fabry - perot sensor or non - contact imaging schemes .",
    "we thereby extend the concept of sparsifying temporal transforms introduced for two - dimensional wave propagation in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the proposed sparsifying transform for the three - dimensional wave equation can be used for any detection geometry .",
    "an extension of our approach to general geometry would , however , complicate the notation .",
    "suppose the photoacoustic source distribution @xmath12 is located in the upper half space @xmath13 .",
    "the induced acoustic pressure @xmath14 satisfies the wave equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the spatial laplacian , @xmath17 is the derivative with respect to time , @xmath18 the sound velocity , and @xmath19 the dirac delta - function . here",
    "@xmath20 acts as the sound source at time @xmath21 and it is supposed that @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "we further denote by @xmath24 the pressure data restricted to the measurement plane .",
    "pat in planar recording geometry is concerned with reconstructing @xmath25 from measurements of @xmath26 .    for recovering @xmath27 from continuous data explicit and stable inversion formulas , either in the fourier domain or in the time domain ,",
    "are well known .",
    "a particularly useful inversion method is the universal backprojection ( ubp ) , @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a reconstruction point , @xmath30 a point on the detector surface , and @xmath31 the distance between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the ubp has been derived in  @xcite for planar , spherical and cylindrical geometries . the two - dimensional version of the ubp @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 has been first obtained in @xcite . in the recent years",
    ", the ubp has been generalized to elliptical observation surface in two and three spatial dimensions @xcite , and various geometries in arbitrary dimension ( see  @xcite ) .      in practical application",
    ", only a discrete number of spatial measurements can be made .",
    "the standard sensing approach in pat is to distribute detector locations uniformly on a part of the observation surface .",
    "such data can be modeled by @xmath37 }   : = ( { \\mathcal w}{p_0 } ) ( { x}_s[i ] , { y}_s[i ] ,   { \\ , \\cdot \\ , } ) \\quad \\textnormal { for } i = 1 , \\dots , n   \\,.\\ ] ] the ubp algorithm applied to semi - discrete data  ( [ eq : pat ] ) consists in discretizing the spatial integral in ( [ eq : ubp3d ] ) using a discrete sum over all detector locations and evaluating it for a discrete number of reconstruction points .",

    "one applies a standard reconstruction procedure ( such as the ubp algorithm  [ alg : ubp ] ) to the estimated point - wise pressure to obtain the photoacoustic source .",

    "however , such an approach is numerically expensive since the three - dimensional wave equation and its adjoint have to be solved repeatedly .",

    "[ fig : hist ] ]    figure  [ fig : hist ] shows histograms of the pressure values before and after applying the sparsifying temporal transform . in both cases the histograms are concentrated around the value zero .",
    "this implies the approximate sparsity and therefore justifies our approach , even if the phantom is not a superposition of uniformly absorbing spheres .",
    "it further shows that for the present situation one could even apply our two - stage procedure without applying the sparsifying transform .",
    "to ensure sparsity in pat , the standard approach is choosing a suitable basis which sparsely represents the pressure data on the measurement surface . in this paper",
    "we developed a different concept based on sparsifying temporal transforms . since any temporal transform intertwines with the spatial measurements our approach can be used in combination with any measurement matrix that is incoherent to the pixel basis .",
    "this includes binary random matrices such as bernoulli , hadamard , or expander matrices ( see  [ sec : cs ] for details ) . according to the compressed sensing theory ,",
    "expander matrices can be used with binary entries 0 and 1 .",
    "bernoulli and hadamard matrices , on the other hand , should be used with zero mean ( achieved , for example taking @xmath131 as binary entries ) . as 0/1 entries",
    "can be practically most simple be realized , for bernoulli and hadamard matrices the mean value has to be subtracted after the measurements process  @xcite .",
    "avoiding such additional data manipulations is one reason why we currently work with expander matrices .",
    "another reason is the sparse structure of expander matrices which can be used to accelerate image reconstruction . in future work",
    "we will also investigate the use of bernoulli and hadamard in combination with sparsifying temporal or spatial transforms , and compare the performance of these measurement ensembles in different situations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , patterned interrogation can be used to practically implement compressed sensing in pat .",
    "it has been realized by using a digital micromirror device @xcite , where a fabry - perot sensor was illuminated by a wide - field collimated beam .",
    "the reflected beam , carrying the ultrasonic information on the acoustic field , was then sampled by the dmd and the spatially integrated response was measured by a photodiode .",
    "another possibility is the application of spatial light modulators ( slms ) , which are able to modulate the phase of the light . by using such slms",
    "arbitrary interrogation patterns can be generated directly on a sample surface @xcite .",
    "slms are commercially available for a wavelength of , which is the most common wavelength used in optical detection schemes",
    ". however , also for other wavelengths appropriate devices are available .",
    "state - of - the - art slms provide typical resolutions between @xmath132 pixels and @xmath133 pixels , which is sufficient for the compressed imaging scheme presented in this work . for a resolution of @xmath132 ,",
    "the typically achieved frame rate is .",
    "this is faster than the pulse repetition rate of commonly used excitation laser sources for pat , thus enabling single shot measurements .",
    "if a faster repetition rate is required , one could use slms with a higher frame rate .",
    "these , however , usually exhibit lower resolution .    for the fabry - perot etalon sensors , the wavelength of the interrogation beam has to be tuned , such that it corresponds to the maximum slope of the transfer function of the sensor .",
    "since for the patterned interrogation scheme only one wavelength is used for the acquisition of the integrated response this demands high quality fabry - perot sensors with highly uniform sensor properties . for non - contact schemes , using mach - zehnder or michelson based demodulation ,",
    "the sensitivity does not depend on the wavelength as the sensor is stabilized by the relative phase between the interrogation beam and a reference beam .",
    "however , if the surface is not adequately flat , the phase of the reflected light is spatially varying . thereby , the sensitivity changes over the detection surface , and even locations with zero or low response could exist . here",
    ", the phase modulation capability of slms offers the possibility to compensate for this . in general , each pixel of a slm can shift the phase of light at least up to @xmath134 and the resulting phase distribution is impressed on the reflected beam .",
    "separate lens functions can be applied to each detection point individually by using distinct kernels for each of these points @xcite . in case",
    "the shape of the sample surface is known , the phase at each detection point can be chosen to compensate for the phase shifts caused by the imperfect sample surface . with this method",
    "it is even possible to choose different focal distances for each detection point , so that detection on even rougher surfaces could be facilitated .",
    "to speed up the data collection process in sequential scanning pat while keeping sensitivity high without significantly increase the production costs , one has to reduce the number of spatial measurements . in this paper",
    "we proposed a compressed sensing scheme for that purpose using random measurements in combination with a sparsifying temporal transform .",
    "we presented a selected review of compressed sensing that demonstrates the role of sparsity and randomness for high resolution recovery . using general results from compressed",

    "recall that @xmath152 is indeed a norm for @xmath153 and a quasi - norm for @xmath154 .",
    "signals of practical interest are often not sparse in the strict sense , but can be well approximated by sparse vectors .",
