    "if the incident flux has no dispersion ( @xmath57 ) , we have @xmath58 ; however , in the polydisperse case , those distributions are different . hereafter , @xmath56 is simply called adsorbed distribution .",
    "another important quantity is the pair correlation function @xmath59 in which the average is taken over different origins @xmath60 and different realizations ; the vector @xmath49 is taken only along the @xmath61 and @xmath62 directions due to the symmetry of the square lattice . in off - lattice rsa , @xmath18 is called radial distribution function and averages are taken along all substrate directions . the probability of finding an occupied site at distance @xmath63 from another occupied site is related to @xmath18 , thus this quantity measures the inhomogeneity of adsorbed mass distribution .",
