    "are restricted to finding combinations of these higer twist operators which do not mix from flavour symmetry . in @xcite the lowest moment of the pion structure function",
    "was considered , @xmath138 where the @xmath139 flavour symmetry group gives the combination @xmath140 . for the nucleon",
    "the @xmath141 flavour symmetry group must be considered , ie taking mass degenerate @xmath142 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 quarks , @xcite , giving @xmath143 ( to access this moment experimentally needs the measurement of structure functions of @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath16 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 baryons . ) these results are for quenched unimproved wilson fermions at @xmath118 , and are very small in comparison with the leading twist result .",
    "however these are rather exotic combinations of matrix elements and say little about individual contributions .",
    "nevertheless this might hint that higher twist contributions are small .",
    "moments for pion and rho structure functions were computed in @xcite , for unimproved wilson fermions . using the sf method ,",
    "@xmath74 was calculated for the pion , @xcite for both unimproved and @xmath60-improved fermions , giving numbers in agreement with @xcite .",
    "finally there have been results for moments of @xmath16 structure functions , @xcite .",
    "these are potentially useful as one can compare with nucleon spin structure and check violation of @xmath141 symmetry .",
    "first indications are that there is little flavour symmetry breaking .",
    "clearly the computation of many matrix elements giving low moments of structure functions is possible .",
    "we would like to emphasise that a successful computation is a fundamental test of qcd  this is not a model computation .",
    "there are however many problems to overcome : finite volume effects , renormalisation and mixing , continuum and chiral extrapolations and unquenching . at present",
    "although overall impressions are encouraging , still it is difficult to re - produce experimental / phenomenological results of ( relatively ) simple matrix elements ( eg @xmath69 , @xmath123 ) .",
    "improvements are thus necessary in all areas .",
    "nevertheless progress is being made : there are now considerations of both chiral and continuum extrapolations , some dynamical results are now available , there are attempts to understand lower quark mass both numerically ( using both wilson fermions and dw fermions ) and from @xmath101-pt . clearly everything depends on the data and the quest for better results should continue . to leave the region where constituent quark masses give a reasonable description of the data ,",
    "seems unfortunately to require quark masses rather close to the @xmath148 mass .",
    "this will presumably also entail the use of unquenched chiral fermions ( such as gw / dw ) .",
    "this will need much faster machines and is , perhaps , a cautionary tale for the determination of other matrix elements .",
    "the qcdsf collaboration numerical calculations were performed on the hitachi _ sr8000 _ at lrz ( munich ) , the ape100 , apemille at nic ( zeuthen ) and on the cray _",
    "t3e_s at nic ( jlich ) and zib ( berlin ) while the ukqcd collaboration unquenched configurations were obtained from the cray _",
    "t3e _ at epcc ( edinburgh ) .",
