    "the entanglement characteristics of the ground states of many body hamiltonians describing condensed matter systems constitute an important area of study in quantum information theory .",
    "entanglement is an essential resource in quatum computation and communication protocols .",
    "condensed matter , specially , spin systems have been proposed as candidate systems for the realization of some of the protocols .",
    "entanglement provides a measure of non - local quantum correlations in the system and it is of significant interest to determine how the correlations associated with the ground state of the system change as one or more than one parameter of the system is changed .",
    "the focus on ground state characteristics arises from the possibility of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) which occur at temperature @xmath8 ( when the system is in its ground state ) and are driven solely by quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a qpt is brought about by tuning a parameter , either external or intrinsic to the hamiltonian , to a special value termed the transition point . in thermodynamic critical phenomena ,",
    "the thermal correlation length diverges and the thermodynamic quantities become singular as the critical point is approached . in the quantum case ,",
    "the correlation length diverges in the vicinity of the qcp and the ground state properties develop non - analytic features .",
    "an issue of considerable interest is whether the quantum correlations , like the usual correlation functions , become long - ranged near the qcp . in a wider perspective",
    ", the major goal is to acquire a clear understanding of the variation in entanglement characteristics as a tuning parameter is changed .",
    "qpts have been extensively studied in spin systems both theoretically and experimentally . in recent years",
    ", several theoretical studies have been undertaken to elucidate the relationship between qpts and entanglement in spin systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , a number of entanglement measures have been identified which develop special features close to the transition point .",
    "one such measure is concurrence which quantifies the entanglement between two spins @xmath9 . at a qcp , as illustrated by a class of exactly - solvable spin models @xmath9 , the derivative of the ground state concurrence has a logarithmic singularity though the concurrence itself is non - vanishing upto only next - nearest - neighbour - distances between two spins @xcite .",
    "discontinuities in the ground state concurrence have been shown to characterize first order qpts @xcite .",
    "later , wu et al .",
    "@xcite showed that under some general assumptions a first order qpt , associated with a discontinuity in the first derivative of the ground state energy , gives rise to a discontinuity in a bipartite entanglement measure like concurrence and negativity .",
    "similarly , a discontinuity or a divergence in the first derivative of the same entanglement measure is the signature of a second order phase transition with a discontinuity or a divergence in the second derivative of the ground state energy .",
    "another measure of entanglement , studied in the context of qpts , is the entropy of entanglement between a block of @xmath10 adjacent spins in a chain with the rest of the system @xcite . at the qcp ,",
    "the entropy of entanglement diverges logarithmically with the length of the block .",
    "there is , however , no direct relation with the long range correlations in the system .",
    "a number of entanglement measures have recently been proposed which are characterized by a diverging length scale , the entanglement length , close to a qcp .",
    "the localizable entanglement ( le ) between two spins is defined as the maximum average entanglement that can be localized between them by performing local measurements on the rest of the spins @xcite .",
    "the entanglement length sets the scale over which the le decays .",
    "the two - body entanglement @xmath3 is a measure of the entanglement between two separated spins , at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the rest of the spins @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be the reduced density matrix for the two spins , obtained from the full density matrix by tracing out the spins other than the ones at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the two body entanglement @xmath3 is given by the von neumann entropy    @xmath14    in a translationally invariant system , @xmath15 depends only on the distance @xmath16 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the spins that are entangled with one or both the spins at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 contribute to @xmath15 .",
    "the following results have been obtained in the case of the @xmath17 exactly solvable anisotropic @xmath18 model in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the model , away from the isotropic limit , belongs to the universality class of the transverse ising model .",
    "the two - body entanglement @xmath3 has a simple dependence on the spin correlation functions in the large @xmath19 limit .",
    "away from the critical point , @xmath3 is found to saturate over a length scale @xmath20 as @xmath19 increases . near the qcp , one obtains    @xmath21    the entanglement length ( el ) , @xmath20 , has an interpretation similar to that in the case of le .",
    "the el diverges with the same critical exponent as the correlation length at the qcp .",
    "@xmath3 thus captures the long range correlations associated with a qpt . at the critical point itself",
    ", @xmath22 has a power - law decay , i.e. , @xmath23 . in the limit of large @xmath19 , the first derivative of @xmath3 w.r.t .",
    "a hamiltonian parameter develops a @xmath24like cusp at the critical point .",
    "the universality and a finite - size scaling of the entanglement have also been demonstrated .",
    "the one - site von neumann entropy    @xmath25    is also known to be a good indicator of a qpt @xcite .",
    "it provides a measure of how a single spin at the site @xmath11 is entangled with the rest of the system .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath26 is obtained from the full density matrix by tracing out all the spins except the one at the site @xmath11 .",
    "oliveira et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a generalized global entanglement ( gge ) measure @xmath4 which quantifies multipartite entanglement ( me ) .",

    "the factor 2 in @xmath4 indicates that the reduced density matrix is that for a pair of particles .",
    "@xcite considered qpts characterized by non - analyticities in the derivatives of the ground state energy .",
    "these arise from the non - analyticities in one or more of the elements of the reduced density matrix . in terms of the gge ,",
    "a discontinuity in @xmath4 signals a first order qpt , brought about by a discontinuity in one or more of the elements , @xmath30_{lm}$ ] of the reduced density matrix @xcite . a discontinuity or divergence in the first derivative of @xmath4 w.r.t .",
    "the tuning parameter occurs due to a discontinuity or divergence in the first derivetives of one or more of the elements of the reduced density matrix .",
    "the associated qpt is of second order .",
    "non - analyticities in @xmath4 and its derivatives thus serve as indicators of qpts . in the case of the @xmath18 @xmath17 spin chain ,",
    "the gge measure shows a diverging el as the qcp is approached .",

    "thus , both the length scales diverge with the same critical exponent near the qcp .",
    "the relationship between entanglement and qpts has mostly been explored for spin-@xmath33 systems .",
    "the entanglement properties of the ground states of certain spin@xmath34 hamiltonians have been studied using different measures @xcite .",
    "numerical studies show that the le has the maximal value for the ground state of the spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnet with open boundary conditions ( obc ) @xcite . in the case of the spin-1 affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model @xcite ,",
    "the result can be proved exactly .",
    "a class of spin-1 models , the @xmath35-deformed aklt models , is characterized by an exponentially decaying le with a finite el @xmath20 .",
    "the length @xmath20 diverges at the point @xmath36 though the conventional correlation length remains finite @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite shows that in the case of spin-1 systems , the use of le for the detection of qpts is not feasible .",
    "an example is given by the @xmath37 xxz heisenberg antiferromagnet with single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the model has a rich phase diagram with six different phases .",
    "the le is found to be always 1 in the entire parameter region and hence is insensitive to qpts .",
    "the ground states of certain spin-1 models have an exact representation in terms of matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the spin-1 aklt model , termed a valence bond solid ( vbs ) state , is an example of an mps .",
    "the ground state is characterized by short - ranged spin - spin correlations and a hidden topological order known as the string order .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the model is further gapped . in the mps formalism ,",
    "ground state expectation values like the correlation functions are easy to calculate .",
    "this has made it particularly convenient to study phase transitions in spin models with mp states as exact ground states @xcite .",
    "the transitions identified so far include both first and second order transitions and are brought about by the tuning of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "the second order transition in the class of finitely correlated mp states , however , differs from the conventional qpt in one important respect .",

    "the correlation length @xmath32 diverges as the transition point is approached .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath39 , however , vanishes at the transition point @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the power - law decay of the correlation function at a conventional qcp .",
    "some distinct features of qpts in mp states have recently been identified @xcite .",
    "one of these relates to the analyticity of the ground state energy density for all values of the tuning parameter . in a conventional qpt ,",
    "the energy density becomes non - analytic at the qcp .",
    "the mp states appear to provide an ideal playground for exploring novel types of qpts . in this paper",
    ", we consider a spin-1 model , the exact ground state of which is given by an mp state @xcite .",
    "the model has a rich phase diagram with a number of first order phase transitions and a critical point transition .",
    "we study the entanglement properties of the ground state with a view to pinpoint the special features which appear close to the critical point .",
    "this is done by using three different entanglement measures , namely , the single - site , two - body and generalized global entanglement defined earlier .",
    "we consider a spin-1 chain hamiltonian proposed by klmper et al .",
    "@xcite which describes a large class of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin-1 chains with mp states as exact ground states .",
    "the hamiltonian satisfies the symmetries : ( i ) rotational invariance in the @xmath40 plane , ( ii ) invariance under @xmath41 and ( iii ) translation and parity invariance .",

    "the nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) interactions are    @xmath47    the constant @xmath46 in eq . ( 5 ) may be adjusted so that the ground state eigenvalue of @xmath48",

    "the global afm state is written as    @xmath62    where ` @xmath63 ' denotes a tensor product .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath64 , i.e. , the state is afm .",

    "we will , however , refer to the point as a qcp since the correlation lengths diverge as the point is approached .",
    "a consequence of the diverging correlation length is that the excitation spectrum of the spin-1 model , which is gapped ( the haldane phase ) for @xmath84 , becomes gapless at the critical point @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the el , @xmath20 , as calculated from @xmath3 in the large @xmath19 limit , also diverges with @xmath31 .",
    "one now has the interesting situation that the entanglement content of the mp state decreases as @xmath1 but the entanglement is spread over larger distances .",
    "the derivative @xmath145 , however , does not diverge as @xmath1 but attains a maximum value at the qcp .",
    "the results can be understood by noting that in all the three cases , @xmath179 and @xmath4 , the reduced density matrices @xmath26 and @xmath13 smoothly approach the forms associated with pure states as the parameter @xmath5 tends to zero .",
    "the matrix elements of the reduced density matrices do not develop non - analyticities in the parameter region of interest .",
    "thus , the energy density , calculated from the reduced density matrix @xmath13 , does not develop a non - analyticity at the qcp .",
    "the derivative @xmath145 depends upon the first derivatives of the matrix elements of @xmath13 .",
    "since the latter is analytic for @xmath180 , @xmath145 does not diverge in the whole parameter regime including the point @xmath0 . in the cases of the entanglement measures @xmath178 and @xmath3 , the derivative @xmath177 diverges as @xmath1 due to the divergence of @xmath181 in the same limit .",
    "the divergence is thus due to the special form of the von neumann entropy and occurs for @xmath182 .",
    "a recent work @xcite provides another example of such a singularity . though @xmath145 does not diverge or become discontinuous at the qcp @xmath0 , it attains its maximum value at the point .",
    "the first derivative of the string order parameter w.r.t .",
    "@xmath5 also attains its maximum value at @xmath0 though the order parameter itself vanishes at the point .",
    "figure @xmath143 shows that amongst the three entanglement measures @xmath175@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , used in this study to obtain a quantitative estimate of the entanglement content of the mp ground state , the measure @xmath3 yields the largest value of the entanglement at different values of @xmath5 . the difference in the singular behaviour of the measures @xmath2 and the mutual information entropy @xmath166 as @xmath1 indicates that multipartite quantum correlations are involved in the qpt . in summary ,",
    "the present study identifies the entanglement characteristics of the mp ground state of a spin-1 model close to the critical point @xmath0 .",
    "the features are distinct from those associated with conventional qpts .",
    "several spin models are known for which the mp states are the exact ground states @xcite .",
    "some of these models have interesting phase diagrams exhibiting both first and second order phase transitions .",
    "it will be of interest to extend the present study to other spin models ( both @xmath17 and @xmath128 ) in order to identify the universal characteristics of qpts in mp states .",
