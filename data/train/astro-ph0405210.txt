    "iron k lines are of indisputable importance in astronomical x - ray spectra . they are unique among commonly observed x - ray lines in that they can be emitted efficiently by gas over a wide range of temperatures and ionization states .",
    "their location in a relatively unconfused spectral region gives impetus to their use as plasma diagnostics .",
    "they were first reported in the rocket observations of the supernova remnant cas a @xcite , in x - ray binaries @xcite and in clusters of galaxies @xcite , the latter revealing the presence of extra galactic nuclear processed material . with the advent of orbiting x - ray detectors",
    "they were observed from almost all classes of astronomical sources detected in the 5 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "further impetus for the study of these lines comes from observations of seyfert galaxies and galactic black hole candidates , some of which show relativistically broadened and red - shifted lines attributed to formation within a few gravitational radii of a black hole @xcite .",
    "recent improvements in the spectral capabilities and sensitivity of satellite - borne x - ray telescopes ( _ chandra _ , _ xmm  newton _ ) have promoted the role of fe  k lines as diagnostics , a trend that will continue with the launch of future instruments such as _ astro - e2 _ and _ constellation - x_. such plasma diagnostics ultimately rely on the knowledge of the micro physics of line formation and hence on the accuracy of the atomic data . in spite of the line identifications by @xcite in solar flare spectra and the laboratory measurements of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the k - vacancy level structures of fe ions remain incomplete as can be concluded from the critical compilation of @xcite . with regards to the radiative and auger rates , the highly ionized members of the iso - nuclear sequence , namely fe  xviii ",
    "fe  xxv , have received much attention @xcite , and the comparisons by @xcite and @xcite have brought about some degree of data assurance .",
    "for fe ions with electron occupancies greater than 9 , @xcite and @xcite have carried out central field calculations on the structure and widths of various inner shell transitions , but these have not been subject to independent checks and do not meet current requirements of level - to - level data and the needs for spectroscopic accuracy implied by recent and future astronomical instruments .",
    "the spectral modeling of k lines also requires accurate knowledge of inner shell electron impact excitation rates and , in the case of photoionized plasmas , of partial photoionization cross sections leaving the ion in photoexcited k - vacancy states . in this respect",
    ", @xcite have shown that the k - threshold resonance behavior is dominated by radiative and auger damping which induce a smeared edge .",
    "that is , photons at energies below the threshold for k shell ionization can excite from the ground state into np ( 3p , 4p , etc . )",
    "k - vacancy states .",
    "these then decay with a high probability by spectator auger channels , in which the k vacancy is filled , and an ionization occurs , by electrons from the l shell .",
    "the excitation is a resonance with a width determined by the auger and radiative lifetimes of the upper level , which can be quite short .",
    "this leads to multiple broad and overlapping resonances below the k edge , with combined strength which equals the k photoionization cross section .",
    "spectator auger decay has been omitted from many previous close - coupling calculations of high - energy continuum processes in fe ions @xcite .",
    "an exception is the recent @xmath4-matrix computation of electron excitation rates of li - like systems by @xcite where it is demonstrated that auger damping is important for low - temperature effective collision strengths .",
    "the present report is part of a project to systematically compute atomic data sets for the modeling of the fe k spectra .",
    "the emphasis of this project is on both accuracy and completeness . for this purpose",
    "we make use of several state - of - the - art atomic physics codes , together with experimentally measured line wavelengths when available , to deliver for the k shell of the entire fe isonuclear sequence : energy levels ; wavelengths , radiative and auger rates , electron impact excitation and photoabsorption cross sections .",
    "most of this work has already been reported in a series of papers , organized loosely in order of descending ionization state : energy levels , transition probabilities and photoionization cross sections for fe  xxiv were reported by @xcite ( hereafter paper  1 ) ; energy levels and transition probabilities for the rest of the first row ions fe  xviii ",
    "fe  xxiii were reported by @xcite ( hereafter paper  2 ) ; energy levels and transition probabilities for the second row ions fe  x  fe  xvii were reported by @xcite ( hereafter paper  3 ) ; properties of the photoionization cross sections and the role of damping by spectator auger resonances were presented by @xcite ( hereafter paper  4 ) ; energy levels and transition probabilities for the third row ions fe  ii  fe  ix were reported by @xcite ( hereafter paper  5 ) ; photoionization and electron impact cross sections were presented for the first row by @xcite ( hereafter paper  6 ) ; and photoionization cross sections for the second row by @xcite ( hereafter paper  7 ) .    in the present paper we present a synthesis of all the data in the series and illustrate the application of these data to calculations of opacity and emission spectra of equilibrium photoionized plasmas .",
    "we explore the systematic behavior of the emission line profile shapes as a function of ionization parameter , the line emissivity as a function of gas density , column density and optical depth , and the absorption line and continuum properties as a function of ionization parameter .",
    "we show that the line profiles , although rich with detail , obey certain systematic behaviors .",
    "the k shell opacity also contains many features which depend on the ionization balance in the gas .",
    "much of the data used for iron k shell which had been incorporated into previous models for the x - ray spectrum is shown to be overly simplified , and in some cases incomplete .",
    "all of the ingredients and results of the calculations published here are publicly available as part of the xstar photoionization code .",
    "the models presented here are simple uniform slab models , but include an extensive suite of atomic data together with self - consistent ionization , excitation , and thermal balance .",
    "the resulting synthetic spectra are somewhat idealized , since they omit any density or pressure gradients and assume normal incidence for the illuminating radiation .",
    "they also use an approximate treatment of continuum compton scattering , which is likely to be important at the large columns where iron k is emitted efficiently .",
    "therefore they serve primarily as illustrations of the relative importance of various physical effects .",
    "these include the relative prominence of spectral features associated with damped lines , both in emission and absorption , and dependence of these quantities on ionization parameter and optical depth .",
    "more realistic synthetic spectra , involving accurate comptonization in static atmospheres and winds , will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the atomic data used in this are compiled from the data sets reported in the previous papers in the series , so we provide here only a brief summary of the assumptions and procedures used in the calculations . for the purposes of discussion , both here and elsewhere ,",
    "the ions in the iron isonuclear sequence can be loosely classified according to the row in the periodic table associated with the various isoelectronic sequence .",
    "we emphasize , here and in what follows , that our goal is the treatment of the transitions and spectral features associated with the k shell of iron , so we have greatly simplified and omitted much of the physics associated with the outer shells in our calculations .",
    "we are confident that this does not significantly affect the accuracy of the results for the k shell , and we discuss reasons for this in what follows .",
    "computation of the atomic parameters for the iron ions requires taking into account the electron correlation and the relativistic corrections together . in our different studies detailed in papers  17 ,",
    "the approach we took is based on the use and comparison of results of several computational platforms , all of them publicly available , namely autostructure @xcite ) , hfr @xcite , and the breit  pauli r - matrix package ( bprm ) based on the close - coupling approximation of @xcite . while the latter was preferred for calculating the electron and photon scattering properties due to its accurate inclusion of the continuum channel coupling , the former two",
    "were chosen for their semi - empirical options which can utilize experimentally measured energy level spacings to improve the theoretical level separations for which the inter - system transition rates are sensitive .",
    "although all these codes include relativistic effects and configuration interactions , autostructure has the most complete breit hamiltonian , i.e. the two - body part of the magnetic interactions .",
    "the breit interaction plays a key role in the highly charged ions of the first row in particular for transitions with small rates and for those involving states subject to strong relativistic couplings .",
    "it was found that the energies and rates are also affected by core relaxation effects ( cre ) and that these effects are more important than the higher order relativistic interactions for the spectator inner shell processes that dominate in the second and third row ions . since , among the platforms used at the time this project was initiated , hfr handled cre more efficiently in ab initio calculations ( autostructure",
    "has since been updated to treat this process efficiently ) , it was used for data production in cases where no experimental level energies were available for the semi - empirical corrections , i.e. in the second and third row ions .    for the first row , a complete set of level energies , wavelengths , @xmath5-values , and total and partial auger rates have been computed for the k - vacancy states within the @xmath6 complex .",
    "the experimental level energies listed in the compilation by @xcite are used in semiempirical adjustment procedures .",
    "it has been found that these adjustments can lead to large differences in both radiative and auger rates of strongly mixed levels .",
    "several experimental level energies and wavelengths have been questioned as a result , and significant discrepancies are encountered with previous decay rates .",
    "these have been attributed to numerical problems in the older work .",
    "the statistical accuracy of the level energies and wavelengths is ranked at @xmath7 ev and @xmath8 m , respectively , and that for @xmath5-values and partial auger rates greater than @xmath9 s@xmath10 at better than 20% .",
    "photoabsorption cross sections across the k edge and electron impact k - shell excitation effective collision strengths have also been calculated .",
    "the target models are represented with all the fine - structure levels within the @xmath6 complex , and the effects of radiation and spectator auger dampings are taken into account by means of an optical potential @xcite . in photoabsorption , these effects cause the resonances converging to the k thresholds to display symmetric profiles of constant width that smear the edge with important implications in spectral analysis .",
    "in collisional excitation , they attenuate resonances making their contributions to the effective collision strength practically negligible .    regarding the second - row ions , the k@xmath0 and kll auger widths",
    "are found to be nearly independent of both outer electrons and electron occupancy keeping a constant ratio of @xmath11 . by comparing with previous theoretical and measured wavelengths",
    ", we estimate the accuracy of the reported wavelengths to be within 2 m . also , the good agreement found between the radiative and auger data sets that are computed with different platforms allow us to propose with confidence an accuracy rating of 20% for the line fluorescence yields",
    "greater than 0.01 .",
    "the predicted emission and absorption spectral features seem to be in good correlation with measurements in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . for computer tractability , photoionization cross sections across both",
    "the l and k edges have been computed in @xmath12 coupling and later split among fine structure levels according to the formula of @xcite .",
    "targets are modeled with all the singly excited terms within the @xmath13 complex .",
    "in similar fashion as for the first - row ions , the effects of radiative and auger dampings are taken into account . @xcite",
    "have published the only experimental study of the k - line spectrum of the fe second row , and they found that the only ion for which the k lines are sufficiently unblended to derive accurate wavelengths is for fe  x. their wavelengths for the doublet in the latter are approximately consistent with the ab - initio values computed by us and by @xcite .",
    "there are no experimental data for fe ions of the third row other than for fe  ii .",
    "for this ion , measurements have been made in the solid , and good agreement is found with our calculations .",
    "level energies , wavelengths , @xmath5-values , auger rates , and fluorescence yields have been obtained for the lowest fine - structure levels populated by photoionization of the ground state of the parent ion . due to the complexity and size of level - to - level auger calculations ,",
    "we have employed a compact formula to compute auger widths from hfr radial integrals @xcite .",
    "an accuracy of @xmath1410% is estimated for the transition probabilities as a result of a comparison of k@xmath1/k@xmath0 branching ratios taken from different theoretical and experimental data sets in the literature . concerning the photoabsorption cross sections ,",
    "a model similar to the one used in paper  4 has been constructed whereby a single 1s  @xmath15  @xmath16p rydberg series of lorentzian resonances converging to each k threshold has been considered in each ionic species .",
    "the partial photoionization cross sections connecting the ground state of the parent ions to the different k - vacancy states have been calculated by autostructure in a single - configuration approximation .    in the present self - consistent photoionization model",
    ", we have incorporated all our published k - vacancy levels for the first - row ions and those populated by photoionization of the parent - ion ground state according to the selection rules of @xcite in the case of species of the second and third rows .",
    "these are the levels whose populations are calculated explicitly and for which the transition rates given in our previous papers have been adopted .",
    "in addition superlevels are included that are associated with the photoabsorption features near the inner - shell edges using the bprm cross sections of papers  67 .",
    "the populations of these superlevels are also calculated , and their effects on the ionization and thermal balances are taken into account .",
    "superlevel decays are treated as ` fake ' transitions , i.e. lines with wavelengths much longer than any of interest to the model results .",
    "such fake transitions are also used to treat the decays of other levels for which we do not explicitly treat the line wavelengths such as the decays of l - vacancy levels in the second and third row ions .",
    "figure  1 shows two examples of energy - level diagrams : in fe  xviii , a typical case of a first row ion , and in fe  x which is representative of a second - row ion . in fe",
    "xviii , the @xmath17{\\rm 2p}^6\\ ^{2}{\\rm s}_{1/2}$ ] k - vacancy state is populated by photoionization of the @xmath18 ground state of fe  xvii .",
    "it then decays to or can be populated from the ground term @xmath19 through k@xmath0 transitions .",
    "it can also decay via kll auger transitions or be populated by the inverse process , i.e. kll dielectronic recombination from the ground configuration @xmath20 of fe  xix .",
    "photoabsorption near the k threshold is considered through a transition from the ground state to the [ k ] superlevel .",
    "that is , the full complexity of the energy dependent absorption cross section is calculated at all energies , but the portion below the k ionization threshold is used to calculate the photoexcitation rate into the [ k ] superlevel rather than as direct ionization .",
    "this @xmath21 $ ] superlevel can then decay to the ground or autoionize .",
    "in the case of fe  x , the @xmath17{\\rm 3p}^6\\ ^{2}{\\rm s}_{1/2}$ ] k - vacancy state is populated by photoionization of the @xmath22 ground state of fe  ix .",
    "it then decays either to the @xmath23 ground term through the k@xmath1 channel or to the @xmath24{\\rm 3p}^6\\ ^{2}{\\rm p}^{\\rm o}_{1/2,3/2}$ ] l - vacancy states via the k@xmath0 channel .",
    "it can also decay through auger transitions , but here we neglect the dielectronic recombination channels from the @xmath25 ground configuration of fe  xi because they involve only kmm autoionization rates which are orders of magnitude weaker than those of the main kll auger decay channels .",
    "we do not treat the cascade from l - vacancy states , and therefore the @xmath24{\\rm 3p}^6\\ ^{2}{\\rm p}^{\\rm o}_{1/2,3/2}$ ] levels are connected to the ground levels with fake transitions .",
    "photoabsorption near the k and l thresholds is considered via transitions that connect the [ k ] and [ l ] superlevels to the ground level .",
    "that is , we take the full absorption cross section including resonance structures from the @xmath4-matrix calculations , and attribute this part of it to photoexcitation into these superlevels . the photoionization transition to the",
    "[ l ] superlevel is associated with small contributions of l - shell channels to the cross section near the k edge .",
    "these contributions cascade through auger decays to the ground level of the neighboring ion , here fe  xi . in the third row , the k - vacancy states decay to l - vacancy states ( k@xmath0 lines ) and to 3p subshell vacancy states ( k@xmath1 lines ) .",
    "the former are populated exclusively by photoionization from the ground level of the parent ion .",
    "we have applied the same treatment of the cascade as for the second - row ions . the l - vacancy and 3p - vacancy levels decay to the ground level through fake transitions .",
    "the photoabsorption near the k edge is described in terms of a single 1s  @xmath15  @xmath16p rydberg series converging to the different k thresholds .",
    "figures  23 plot the energies of the lines and k edges in our data set as a function of ionization stage which can be compared with those presented by @xcite and by @xcite . for each ion the energies of all the components of a line or a k photoionization edge are plotted with equal weight and without accounting for broadening due to damping or blending into an unresolved transition array ( uta ) .",
    "so the dispersion in the line or photoionization threshold - energy for each ion represents the range in centroid energies of various lines or continua .",
    "this does not take into account the broadening due to damping or the relative strengths of the various components arising from the distribution of upper - level populations and transition probabilities . in section",
    "2.2 synthetic profiles are presented which take these factors into account .",
    "the distinction between the low and high ionization stages is apparent : for the third row the dispersion in line and k - threshold energies within a given ion can be comparable to the difference in these quantities between adjacent stages although the k@xmath1 line provides a sensitive diagnostic of the charge state . for example , the k@xmath0 energies are in the range 63856403 ev in fe  ii  vii . for fe  viii ",
    "xi , the k@xmath0 energy interval actually decreases slightly to 63816403 ev .",
    "this is somewhat counter - intuitive since generally binding energies increase with increasing ionization causing all line energies to increase .",
    "however , the k@xmath0 lines are sensitive to both the 1s and 2p electron binding energies .",
    "the former does increase with increasing ion stage while the 2p energy decreases slightly due to the changing interaction with the 3d shell electrons .",
    "further evidence for this comes from the fact that the k@xmath1 line energy increases between fe  i and fe  xi as the k@xmath0 energy decreases . for fe  xii  xiii the line intervals increase to 63806415 ev , for fe  xiv  xv increasing by approximately 3 ev per ion from 63856422 ev to 63916428 ev .",
    "fe  xvi has a particularly simple structure owing to its na - like configuration , with lines at 6414 ev and 6426 ev .",
    "for the first row , k@xmath1 is unimportant , and there is much greater separation between various ion stages .",
    "each ion stage has line energies ranging over @xmath14200 ev .",
    "note that some first - row ions can emit lines at energies below 6.4 kev ; for example , transitions such as @xmath26 in fe  xix produce lines near 1.99 (6.23 kev ) .",
    "these transitions are strongly affected by configuration interaction with , for instance , @xmath27 and have relatively small @xmath5-values ( @xmath1410@xmath28 s@xmath10 ) .",
    "each bprm cross section in papers  67 ( first and second row ions ) is tabulated on an energy grid containing several thousand points . in order to include these data into the xstar database",
    ", compression is invoked using the resonance - average photoionization ( rap ) method and the numerical representation of rap cross sections proposed by @xcite .",
    "the choice of the accuracy parameter ( @xmath29 ) is guided by the instrumental resolution of the xrs on board _ astro - e2 _ at the energies of the iron k lines , i.e. @xmath30 ( 10 times the xrs resolving power at 6.4 kev ) .",
    "figure  4 plots the photoabsorption cross sections for the various ions , and in table  [ feat ] we give the strongest near k - edge absorption features that can be resolved by the xrs ( resolving power of 1000 ) .",
    "each feature can be due to a superposition of several resonances ; the feature parameters , namely wavelength , oscillator strength , and full width at half maximum , are fitted values extracted from gaussian profiles using rap cross sections with @xmath31 .",
    "examination of figure  4 shows a variety of different cross - section behaviors , depending crudely on ionization stage ( i.e. first , second , or third row ) and on the fine structure of both the valence- and inner - shell electron configurations . in the third row ,",
    "resonance features are close to the threshold often overlapping and k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 do not appear .",
    "the second row shows more complex behavior , and k@xmath1 also appears in absorption . in the first row",
    "both k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 appear in absorption , along with a very rich and distinct resonance spectrum below threshold .",
    "more details of the resonance features and a description of the level scheme adopted for each ion are given in the appendix .",
    "results in the following section were calculated by incorporating the k vacancy energy levels , and the transitions connecting them to other states of the ions of iron , into the xstar modeling code ( kallman and bautista 2001 ) .",
    "xstar calculates the level populations , ion fractions , temperature , opacity and emissivity of a gas with specified elemental composition , under the assumption that all relevant physical processes are in a steady state .",
    "the calculation is a full collisional - radiative model in the sense that all level populations are explicitly calculated , and the lte balance is attained under the conditions of high gas density or planckian radiation field .",
    "radiative equilibrium is achieved by calculating the integral over the net emitted ( @xmath32 ) and absorbed energy ( @xmath33 ) in the radiation field and varying the gas temperature until the integrals satisfy the criterion @xmath34 .",
    "radiative transfer of the ionizing continuum is treated with a simple two stream approximation , and diffusely emitted lines and continua are subject to trapping according to an escape probability formalism .",
    "expressions for escape probabilities are given in @xcite , and these are applied uniformly to all emitted photons using optical depths which are calculated self - consistently at each point in the model slab based on the database oscillator strengths , voigt profiles accounting for thermal doppler broadening and natural broadening , and the column density of the relevant lower level integrated over the slab .",
    "xstar by itself does not allow accurate treatment of elastic scattering due to compton scattering .",
    "this process is treated in the same way as absorption , which will tend to overestimate the attenuation at large column densities , @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "models which incorporate a more accurate treatment will be presented in a subsequent paper .    in the models presented here we have not included the effects of resonant photoexcitation on the line emission .",
    "this process affects k@xmath0 lines only from the first row ions , and it depends on the geometry assumed for the line emitting gas : if the emitting gas is spherically symmetric surrounding the continuum source , and stationary , then photoexcitation is negligible .",
    "fluorescence emission is not affected by this assumption .",
    "previous versions of xstar had a limited treatment of the iron k shell , utilizing the photoionization cross sections of @xcite for the k shell photoionization , together with the line energies and fluorescence and auger yields from @xcite . in order to incorporate the new atomic data rates",
    "we have added our chosen subset of the k vacancy levels and line transitions connecting them with l- and m - shell levels .",
    "we account for the full radiative - auger cascade following a k - shell photoionization event in any first row ion . for the intermediate and low charged ions , i.e. the second and third row ions , multiple ionization following the ejection of a k - shell photo electron",
    "is incorporated by adding non - radiative decays of the k - vacancy levels into the ground levels of the neighboring ions .",
    "the rates used for these transitions are obtained by multiplying the auger widths of the k - vacancy upper level by the branching ratios given by @xcite . in these cases",
    ", we do not treat l- and m - fluorescence line emission during auger cascade , since our atomic calculations do not include decays of l shell vacancy levels .",
    "this omission has a small effect on our ionization balance since the rates for valence shell photoionization always exceed the rate for k shell ionization by large factors .",
    "the treatment of k shell photoionization and the associated opacity is divided into two parts .",
    "absorption events which result in direct ionization , i.e. photons with energies above the threshold for photoionization , are treated using the conventional expression ( eg .",
    ", osterbrock 1978 ) integrating the product of the photoionization cross section and ionizing photon flux over energy .",
    "absorption by photons just below threshold are treated differently depending on the type of ion , i.e. first , second , or third row ion . for a first row ion ,",
    "the resonant photoabsorption events that connect the ground state to excited @xmath17n{\\rm p}$ ] states lying just below the k threshold are lumped together into a superlevel [ k ] which decays back to the ground state through a fake radiative transition .",
    "the rate for excitation into these levels , and the associated opacity , are treated in a manner analogous to photoionization , i.e. with a continuous opacity distribution convolved with the radiation field . in the second row ,",
    "another superlevel is added , superlevel [ l ] , in order to incorporate the photoabsorption structure near the l edge .",
    "the contribution of the l - shell photoionization to the k - shell photoabsorption cross section near the k threshold is treated as a transition from the ground level of the parent ion to the superlevel [ l ] which can auto ionize to the ground level of the next charge stage . concerning the third row ions",
    ", the photoabsorption features near threshold are implemented as photoionization transitions that connect the ground level of the parent ion to the k - vacancy levels .",
    "the photoabsorption cross section for each ion then can be divided into contributions from bound - bound transitions into explicitly treated levels ( the k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 lines are examples ) , bound - bound transitions into resonances near thresholds which are lumped together into a superlevel or into photoionization transitions into inner shell thresholds , and direct photoionization by the various sub shells .    the ionization balance of iron , and temperature structure of our models ,",
    "are shown in figures  5 and 6 .",
    "these were calculated using a simple @xmath37 ionizing spectrum and cosmic abundances @xcite . as a rule of thumb",
    ", this figure shows that first row ions predominate for log(@xmath38)@xmath39 2 , second row ions are important 1 @xmath40 log(@xmath38)@xmath40 2 , and third row ions for log(@xmath38)@xmath40 1 .",
    "for the purpose of illustrating the behavior of k lines in photoionized gas , we consider line emission and absorption in a spherical shell of gas surrounding a point source of continuum radiation .",
    "we assume cosmic element abundances @xcite , constant gas density , and an @xmath37 power law ionizing spectrum .",
    "in such a cloud the emissivity of the k lines is given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the photoionization threshold energy , @xmath43 is the local flux , @xmath44 is the k shell photoionization cross section , @xmath45 is the fluorescence yield , @xmath16 is the gas density , @xmath46 is the iron elemental abundance , and @xmath47 is the population of the lower level .",
    "this can be rewritten in terms of the local specific luminosity , @xmath48 , where @xmath4 is the distance from the source of ionizing radiation to the inner shell surface , and @xmath49 is the ionizing luminosity of the continuum source .",
    "we define the emissivity per particle :    @xmath50    and @xmath51 is the ionization parameter ( tarter tucker and salpeter , 1969 ) .",
    "this shows that the line emissivity is proportional to the ionization parameter .",
    "the line luminosity emitted by a thin spherical shell of uniform ionization , composition and density is then    @xmath52    and the line equivalent width is    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the radial column density of the shell . if @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath47=1 , @xmath45=0.34 , and cosmic iron ,    @xmath57    and @xmath58 is the column in units of @xmath59 @xmath36 , and we have adopted the hydrogenic value for the threshold cross section .",
    "equations ( 3)-(5 ) show that the line luminosity depends on factors related to atomic rates , the ionization balance , the intensity of the ionizing radiation , the amount of emitting gas ( here parameterized by the cloud column density ) . in what follows",
    "we present the dependence of the emission line properties on various of these factors : ionization parameter , gas density , line optical depth , and column density .      as a check on our results we have calculated fluorescence yields for each line , and for each ion averaged over all the k lines .",
    "we do this by calculating the ratio of the net radiative rate out of the upper level for each k line by the net rate into the level .",
    "the average over the ion is calculated by taking the ratio of the total line emission rate to the total excitation rate for all the levels of the ion .",
    "these are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the first column is the ion stage , the second column is the average per - ion fluorescence yield calculated using the above procedure , which is equivalent to weighting the individual lines according to the excitation rate when calculating the average .",
    "the third column shows the average per - ion yield calculated by assuming the levels are populated according to statistical weights .",
    "this is the assumption intrinsic to the configuration average values quoted by most previous authors , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table 2 shows that the yield is generally a slowly varying function of the ion charge state , increasing from the classical value of 0.34 for fe ii through the third and second row , and then decreasing beyond fe xix .",
    "comparison of the the second and third columns shows that the averaging makes little difference for ions fe ii ",
    "fe xvii , i.e. the second and third rows of the periodic table .",
    "this is due to the fact that the auger and radiative probabilities are independent of the valence shell structure for the these ions , a point which has been made in our previous papers .",
    "this means that the yields for all the k line upper levels are approximately constant for these ions , although we find variations by @xmath60 for some ions . in the ions of the first row of the periodic table , fe xvii  xxiv",
    ", the individual level yields can differ by large factors ( see paper 2 ) , and the averaging scheme is important .",
    "thus we find that for fe xxii and fe xxiii the average yield is considerably lower than that found by @xcite , owing to the fact that photoionization from the ground state of the parent ion tends to select k vacancy levels which have lower yields .",
    "the value for fe xxiv is affected by the fact that there is no dipole - allowed decay of the most probable final state of a k shell photoionization event .      in figure  7",
    "we plot the ratio of the emissivity per particle for k line production to the ionization parameter for a sequence of model slabs with column density @xmath61 @xmath36 as a function of ionization parameter , @xmath38 .",
    "the various curves correspond to the contribution from the ions of iron , summed over the k lines of each ion .",
    "these curves were calculated using a set of xstar models of thin spherical shells illuminated by the same @xmath55 spectrum as was used in deriving equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "using the same fluorescence yield , cross section , abundance , etc .",
    ", in equation  ( 2 ) as was used in equation  ( 5 ) , we predict @xmath62 , while figure 7 gives @xmath63 .",
    "figure 7 shows that the emissivities of the various ions peak close to the ionization parameter where the corresponding ion fraction peaks .",
    "differences between the curves are due to differences in the ionization balance , k shell photoionization rate , and auger yield .",
    "comparison with figure 5 , the ionization distribution , shows that the contribution of a given ion to the line emissivity is shifted down in ionization parameter to the value where the parent ion dominates the ionization distribution , thus fe xix dominates the line emission near log(@xmath38)=2 , where fe xviii dominates the ionization balance .",
    "also , ions which appear prominently in the line emissivity distribution are generally not those which dominate the ionization balance , but rather their ionization products .",
    "thus fe xviii and xix appear more prominently in the line emissivity plot than does fe xvii , although the converse is true in the ionization balance .",
    "similar behavior occurs for fe x vs. fe ix .",
    "this is of interest because ions such as fe x and fe xviii have nearly filled atomic shells ( k - like and f - like ) and therefore simpler level structure than ions with half - filled subshells .",
    "this may aid in interpretation of spectra .",
    "essentially all the k lines of observational interest have transition probabilities which are greater than 10@xmath64 s@xmath10 . as a result , very high densities are required for collisional suppression of k lines under astrophysical conditions . at lower densities collisions can play a role in determining the populations of the lower levels for some k lines .",
    "this is because many of the valence shells have fine structure levels with critical densities less than 10@xmath28 @xmath65 .",
    "the populations of these levels determine the relative strengths of the various components of the k lines .",
    "these populations can also affect the dependence of line strengths on optical depth , which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "density dependence arises because of mixing of the fine structure levels of the ground term such mixing can either enhance or suppress the net line emission from a given ion , depending on whether the excited sublevels can ionize to k vacancy levels with larger or smaller fluorescence yields . in either case",
    ", the spectrum will be changed , as line components of different energy are emitted .",
    "our treatment of the photoionization and excitation accounts for all the photoionization channels , and the fluorescence and auger decays of the k vacancy levels they produce , for all the levels of the first row ions which may be of interest in photoionization .",
    "that is , we consider k shell photoionization from all the levels within @xmath6650 ev of the ground level , which includes all the levels of the ground terms of these ions .",
    "for the second and third row , our treatment does not accurately account for differences in the k line excitation properties of excited levels .",
    "that is , we include photoionization and the subsequent line emission processes for the excited levels of the ground term , but these rates are duplicates of rates for the ground level .",
    "so for these ions we can not accurately predict density dependent effects .",
    "figure  8 shows the ratio of the line emissivity at a given density to that at a density 10@xmath67 @xmath65 from a series of model slabs with ionization parameter log(@xmath38)=2 and column density 10@xmath68 @xmath36 . in preparing this figure",
    "we have also corrected for the fact that the ionization balance depends ( weakly ) on the density , by dividing the line emissivity by the fractional abundance of the parent ion at each density . since density acts to mix the levels of the ground term , the effect of increasing density is to redistribute the population from the ground level to the other levels in the term .",
    "the net effect summed over the lines of a given ion is small for many ions , since the line fluorescence efficiency is similar for k shell ionization of the various levels of the ground configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "some ions show a strong density effect , and this can act either to enhance or suppress the total k line emission for that ion . for fe xxii ,",
    "the line emission is enhanced at density great than @xmath69 @xmath65 , due to mixing of population into the j=1 level of the ground term of the parent ion , fe xxi .",
    "this level has a larger photoionization cross section than the ground level , leading to enhanced line emission . for fe xxi , which is produced by photoionization of fe xx ,",
    "the effect is opposite ; the excited levels of the ground term have lower photoionization cross section than ground .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is a factor @xmath142  3 .",
    "this figure also shows onset of collisional suppression which affects all the k lines at density @xmath70 @xmath65 .",
    "k lines from second and third row ions are not subject to resonance scattering because their lower levels are inner shell vacancy states , and so do not exist in significant populations in astrophysical plasmas . in first row ions the partially filled l shell allows resonance absorption of k line photons .",
    "as has been pointed out by @xcite and others , this can lead to efficient destruction of these lines since there is a significant ( @xmath3910@xmath71 ) probability of auger decay for the upper levels each time a line photon scatters .",
    "this auger destruction has been suggested as an explanation for the apparent absence of k lines from first row ions in some astrophysical sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of multiple lower levels for the k lines from many of these ions allows for alternate radiative decays of some of the upper levels of these resonantly absorbed k lines . as pointed out by @xcite , this may limit or negate the effectiveness of auger destruction .",
    "in addition , the presence of alternate decays may increase the total k line flux from a given ion , since it provides a channel for the escape of line photons which may be less optically thick than the main channel .",
    "this effect is displayed in figure  9 , which shows the dependence of the line formation efficiency on line optical depth .",
    "this figure was calculated by taking a model slab calculated with xstar , initially chosen to have log(@xmath38)=2 . and column density 10@xmath72 @xmath36 , and progressively increasing the optical depths of all the lines by a multiplicative factor which is displayed as the horizontal axis of the figure .",
    "this shows that , for the first row ions which dominate the ionization distribution under these conditions , auger destruction does result in a net suppression of most lines over the range of multiplication factors shown here .",
    "however , the effect requires large enhancements in the optical depth beyond what is found in this fiducial slab model .",
    "the reason for this is that the k line optical depth for the strongest lines of each ion in the slab is @xmath73 , for a line width @xmath74 s@xmath10 ( comparable to the natural radiative width for strong k lines and to the doppler width at 10@xmath75k ) , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . but",
    "this neglects the fact that most of the ground terms have multiple levels , and hence at least two k line components . increasing the optical depth has the effect of shifting the emitted line energy from the dominant component into the weaker one , such that the sum remains approximately constant .",
    "auger destruction does not become important until the optical depths in both components are greater than unity .",
    "since the fiducial slab has very small population in the lower levels of many of the components , very large enhancements in the optical depths are needed in order to suppress the net emitted k line flux .",
    "a more realistic estimate of the importance of auger destruction comes from the results of a family of model slabs calculated as a function of column density .",
    "results of such a calculation are shown in figure  10 , which displays the line emissivity per ion summed over the lines of various ions .",
    "this figure shows that at the largest columns there is a net decrease in the line emissivity , particularly for the first row .",
    "but in this case the effect is primarily due to the change in the ionization balance of the slab ; at high columns the average ionization of the slab decreases owing to the shielding of the deeper regions",
    ". evidence for this comes from the fact that the k lines due to the second and third row ions increase at large columns , as the first row ion lines decrease .",
    "the total emissivity of the slab , summed over all ions , does decrease at the highest ionization parameters , by a factor of order unity .",
    "this suggests that ionization balance effects are more important than auger destruction in determining the strengths of the k lines from first row ions in real slabs . however , this conclusion depends on the details of the conditions in the emitting gas .",
    "if the temperature and density were greater than what we consider , then the populations of all the k line lower levels can be comparable .",
    "if so , auger destruction may have a comparable effect on all the k lines of a given ion .",

    "<S> we calculate the efficiency of iron k line emission and iron k absorption in photoionized models using a new set of atomic data . </S>",
    "<S> these data are more comprehensive than those previously applied to the modeling of iron k lines from photoionized gases , and allow us to systematically examine the behavior of the properties of line emission and absorption as a function of the ionization parameter , density and column density of model constant density clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for example , the net fluorescence yield for the highly charged ions is sensitive to the level population distribution produced by photoionization , and these yields are generally smaller than those predicted assuming the population is according to statistical weight . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the effects of the many strongly damped resonances below the k ionization thresholds conspire to smear the edge , thereby potentially affecting the astrophysical interpretation of absorption features in the 7 - 9 kev energy band . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the centroid of the ensemble of k@xmath0 lines , the k@xmath1 energy , and the ratio of the k@xmath2 to k@xmath3 components are all diagnostics of the ionization parameter of our model slabs . </S>"
