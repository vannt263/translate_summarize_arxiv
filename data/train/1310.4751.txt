    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models are one of the most promising candidates of the theory beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the susy models is that they have a number of light scalar fields called flat directions or moduli , which describes deformations of the effective system .",
    "therefore , these models may have many quasi - degenerated vacua , which could be stable or metastable .",
    "our universe may arise from one of those vacua . since the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the moduli determines the low - energy effective theory , it is important to find the way how these moduli find their vacuum when the moduli are not static .",
    "thinking about the very early stage of the cosmological evolution , these fields might have a large kinetic energy compared to their potential energy .",
    "a decade ago , kofman et.al . suggested in their paper `` beauty is attractive ''  @xcite that a vacuum could be chosen because it is attractive .",
    "their critical observation is that since new degrees of freedom become light when the modulus passes through the enhanced symmetry point ( esp ) , these species could be produced by the quantum effects and could alter the dynamics in such a way as to drive the moduli towards the esp .",
    "they called this mechanism `` trapping '' .",
    "their basic argument was based on the effective theory that contains an interaction between two scalar fields : @xmath7 the interaction may arise in a system of moving branes , in which a gauge symmetry of the effective action could be enhanced when branes pass through .    on the other hand , we know that in some cases moduli in the effective action may not be coupled to light fields through renormalizable couplings , in the sense that they may have interactions suppressed by the cutoff scale",
    ". a typical example could be the neutrino mass in the see - saw mechanism , which couples to the higgs scalar field through higher dimensional interaction in the low energy effective theory .",
    "note that in this paper we are considering a more general situation , which has not been considered in ref .",
    "we are extending the original scenario to include higher dimensional interaction , to show that such interaction is indeed responsible for particle production and trapping .",
    "we consider interaction : @xmath8 which is sometimes called `` higher dimensional '' interaction , since the mass dimension of @xmath9 is higher than four .",
    "one might think that higher dimensional interaction is not important because it is suppressed by the cutoff scale ; however a trivial adiabatic condition ( @xmath10 , which will be defined later in this paper ) suggests that particle production is possible in a wider area than conventional trapping .",
    "although the qualitative argument based on the adiabatic condition is suggesting that higher dimensional interaction could be important , it is not quite obvious whether such interaction is responsible for trapping .",
    "obviously , the quantitative estimation of quantum particle production is far from trivial .    in this paper",
    ", we study the production of the particles when higher dimensional interaction is responsible for the mechanism .",
    "the amount of particle production will be calculated extending the method developed in ref .",
    "our conclusion is that particle production via higher dimensional interaction is significant in a wide area around the esp .",
    "our result is consistent with the naive estimation based on the adiabatic condition .",
    "moreover , using the numerical calculation , we demonstrate thattrapping is indeed possible via higher dimensional interaction .",
    "interestingly , as is expected from the adiabatic condition , we confirmed that the area of trapping becomes wider than conventional trapping .",
    "our conclusion is that the mechanism can play an important role in selecting the vacuum in the early universe .",
    "note that even if one is considering the conventional esp , one might have to consider higher dimensional interaction , since in reality there could be multiple fields that are responsible for the symmetry breaking . in that case quantum particle production must be calculated when the original symmetry is already broken by the other fields ( but higher dimensional interaction could remain ) .",
    "whose mass is determined by higher dimensional interaction .",
    "note that @xmath11 could not be identical to the conventional @xmath12 , which becomes massive when the gauge symmetry is broken .",

    "the result is consistent with the naive estimation from the adiabatic condition .",
    "after the quantum excitation of @xmath15 , @xmath14 moves away from the esp . however , the interaction causes back - reaction , since the motion increases the mass of @xmath15 particle ( @xmath33 ) . as a result ,",

    ", the interaction seems to be weaker for larger @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , there could be a tension between these effects , which can not be solved without looking into more details of the mechanism .      before solving eq.([eq : lagrangian_with_hdi ] ) , we need to include @xmath47 for the normalization : @xmath48 where @xmath47 is defined by @xmath49 and @xmath22 is a frequency of the quantum field @xmath15 defined by @xmath50 @xmath47 is needed to subtract a divergence in the coleman - weinberg potential .",

    "this feature plays an important role in obtaining the realistic quark and lepton masses and mixings and in solving the doublet - triplet splitting problem in the realistic models .",
    "note that in this model the effective mass of the low - energy effective action is induced by higher dimensional interaction , which explains the hierarchy of the mass scales .    obviously , the most beautiful and therefore the most attractive point would be the origin , where the vevs of all ( moduli / higgs ) fields @xmath140 vanish and a lot of @xmath15 species @xmath140 become massless .",

    "they have nearly 2000 massless fields at the mesp . therefore , there are plenty of @xmath15 fields that may cause trapping .",
    "since in these models the mass terms in the low - energy effective theory are generated by higher dimensional interaction generically , we are expecting that higher dimensional interaction is really responsible for trapping and vacuum selection .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous subsection , it seems unlikely that all moduli fields meet together accidentally at the mesp even once .",
    "we are expecting that fields will be trapped one after another and finally all moduli fields are trapped around the mesp .",
    "one might be anxious about the decay of @xmath15 fields  @xcite , which has not been mentioned in our analysis .",
    "consider the situation in which several moduli fields are already trapped on certain attractive hypersurface .",
    "if those moduli fields are responsible for the mass of some @xmath15 fields ( @xmath192 ) , basically @xmath192 are light . when another moduli field comes across other attractive hypersurface , the @xmath193 particles produced by the moduli field can become heavier than @xmath192 at least when the moduli field moves away from the attractive hypersurface . in that case",
    "the heavy field @xmath193 could decay into @xmath192 , if the lifetime of @xmath193 is shorter than the time scale of the oscillation .",
    "if @xmath193 decays into @xmath192 , the number density of @xmath193 becomes smaller than that without decay , and therefore , attractive force to the attractive hypersurface is weakened .",
    "namely , @xmath193 fields with longer lifetime produce more attractive force to the attractive hypersurface .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the @xmath15 particles with masses from higher dimensional interaction have a longer lifetime , because they are lighter and expected to have higher dimensional interaction even for the decay .",
    "therefore , such @xmath15 particles may have some advantages for trapping in this situation .",
    "let us consider another situation in which two moduli fields @xmath194 and @xmath195 oscillate around different hypersurfaces .",
    "when the modulus @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) passes through each attractive hypersurface , the particles @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) are produced .",
    "the masses of these @xmath15 particles are dependent on time because the distance from the hypersurface changes .",
    "when @xmath196 becomes heavier than @xmath197 , @xmath196 can decay into @xmath197 , and when @xmath197 becomes heavier than @xmath196 , @xmath197 can decay to @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , when the moduli field passes through the attractive hypersurfaces , the @xmath15 particles are produced not only by breaking the adiabatic conditions but also by decaying from other heavy particles .",
    "the situation becomes highly complex .",
    "again , the @xmath15 particles with longer lifetime have an advantage for trapping .",
    "it is unclear whether the vacuum is trapped at the mesp in the last or not , but in this subsection , we assume that the vacuum is trapped at least near the mesp",
    ".    the true trapped point may not be the mesp if the masses of fields @xmath15 which dominate the energy density are from higher dimensional interaction with @xmath198 .",
    "this is because their contributions to the effective potential can not dominate @xmath199 around the mesp .",
    "this may be important to apply the gut models because monopoles do not appear in this situation .",
    "( note that the gauge symmetry is not recovered by trapping . )",
    "note also that in the above scenario susy is broken at the mesp , and therefore , it is not the true vacuum . moreover , because of the susy breaking , the scalar component fields have masses which are proportional to the fi parameter @xmath146 and the anomalous @xmath127 charges .",
    "the negatively charged fields like gut higgs fields have negative mass square , and therefore they are unstable without the support by the produced @xmath15 particles .",
    "therefore , the gut higgs fields trapped around the mesp are supposed to move away from the mesp to find the true vacuum after dilution of the produced @xmath15 fields .",
    "basically , the vacuum which satisfies the relation ( [ susyvacuum ] ) is selected in the last because the other vacua with the vevs @xmath200 are far from the mesp as discussed in the previous subsection . ) , because matter fields have positive anomalous @xmath127 charges in the models .",
    "]    however , in the realistic gut models , we have several vacua which satisfy the relations ( [ susyvacuum ] ) .",
    "one of these vacua gives the realistic low - energy effective action .",
    "the situation is very similar to the minimal susy @xmath201 gut , which has three supersymmetric vacua with the gauge symmetries @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "we have not understood why @xmath203 is selected .",
    "usually , it is expected to happen accidentally . however ,",
    "if we study the trapping process and the moving process after trapping in detail , this important question may be answered .",
    "finally , we would like to mention the possibility of inflation after trapping .",
    "our optimistic expectation is that inflation and vacuum selection are both explained by particle production . here",
    "the mesp is a local maximum in the effective potential , whose height is @xmath204 .",
    "@xmath205 is just below the usual gut scale ( @xmath206 ) , because of the relation @xmath207",
    "more specifically , we can take @xmath208 that gives @xmath209 gev .",
    "the potential @xmath210 is too steep to satisfy the slow roll condition for sufficient @xmath211 value in usual way .",
    "there are many inflationary models in which trapping plays a crucial role  @xcite and also the many - field model may accommodate slow - roll inflation on the steep potential  @xcite , but",
    "it is unclear if the gut theory could be responsible for inflation  @xcite .",
    "we expect that inflaton becomes sufficiently slow because of particle production .",
    "since the origin is tremendously attractive ( i.e. , quite many massless fields appear at the origin ) in the anomalous @xmath127 gut models , the dissipation effect due to particle production can not be negligible .",
    "we will study this subject in future .",
    "in this paper , we have studied quantum particle production and trapping through higher dimensional interaction .",
    "quantum particle production is possible when the moduli field @xmath14 passes through the non - adiabatic area around the esp .",
    "we have extended the model  @xcite and considered quantum particle production in which the mass of the particles comes from higher dimensional interaction .",
    "we found that particle production is possible in the non - adiabatic area , which could be larger than the conventional scenario .",
    "we have confirmed quantum particle production and trapping for higher dimensional interaction .",
    "then we have considered the possibility of vacuum selection via particle production in realistic gut models , which are called anomalous @xmath127 gut . in such models ,",
    "the most serious problem called the doublet - triplet splitting can be solved as well as realistic quark and lepton masses and mixings are obtained under the reasonable assumption that all interactions including higher dimensional ones allowed by the symmetry are introduced with @xmath139 coefficients .",
    "however , they have infinite unexpected vacua in general because of the natural assumption .",
    "this issue can be solved by considering vacuum selection by quantum particle production , because the most attractive point is near the physically viable vacuum in these models .",
    "it is important to understand why vacuum selection is possible among various vacua in susy models .",
    "our expectation is that the dynamical history of the universe , including quantum creation of the particles and trapping , is important for that purpose .",
    "hopefully , our investigation is helpful in understanding the dynamics .",
