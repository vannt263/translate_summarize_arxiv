    "the physical picture of solid - liquid phase transition has emerged as a controversial issue motivated by both science and industry since early 20th century when divergent accounts of the instability mechanism and atom - scale pathway towards melting in various theoretical models did not seem to yield a unanimous prediction for the melting point of a realistic system lindemann , born , att1 , att2 , att3 , att4 , lennard - jones and devonshire .",
    "the widely - cited lindemann @xcite and born @xcite criteria , do not form an exception to this discrepancy at a glance : in the former criterion , lindemann proposed that melting is triggered by the avalanche of the root - mean - square atom displacement as soon as it exceeds a threshold fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the atom spacing , where @xmath3 is called the critical lindemann ratio , a semi - empirical parameter initially conceived as a lattice type characteristic ( but experiments @xcite suggest otherwise ) ; in the latter criterion , born argued that the vanishment of shear modulus ( ref .",
    "@xcite challenges this vanishment experimentally ) is responsible for the inability to resist lattice destruction at the melting point .    in this series of papers , we give a detailed presentation of how to join the lindemann and born criteria together .",
    "we use a model analogous to the @xmath4-@xmath5 model for frustrated antiferromagnets to formulate that the cooperative creation and the spatial correlation of interstitialcies are the impetus that triggers and propagates instability in a crystal and that eventually undermines long - range order in the surface - free solid ( bulk material ) .",
    "this idea is inspired by a recent molecular dynamics simulation in which the rle of interstitialcies is emphasized @xcite , the previous understandings of the rles of vacancies in surface melting @xcite , the formation and motion of interstitial clusters in metals @xcite and semiconductors @xcite , early theories of interstitialcies based on computer simulations stilinger and weber , juelich and some thermodynamic arguments first - order transition , granato , and especially the notion of `` virtual attraction '' between defects in ref . @xcite .",
