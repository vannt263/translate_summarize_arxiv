    "understanding the generic behavior of systems consisting of large numbers of coupled oscillators is of great interest because such systems occur in a wide variety of significant applications@xcite .",
    "examples are the synchronous flashing of groups of fireflies , coordination of oscillatory neurons governing circadian rhythms in animals@xcite , entrainment in coupled oscillatory chemically reacting cells@xcite , josephson junction circuits@xcite , neutrino oscillations@xcite , bubbly fluids@xcite , etc .",
    "a key contribution in this area was the introduction of the following model by kuramoto@xcite , @xmath0 where the state of oscillator @xmath1 is given by its phase @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the natural frequency of oscillator @xmath1 , and the coupling constant @xmath5 specifies the strength of the influence of one oscillator on another .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that in the @xmath6 limit there is a continuous phase transition such that , for @xmath5 below a critical value @xmath7 , no coherent behavior of the system occurs ( i.e. , there is no global correlation between the oscillator phases ) , while above the critical coupling strength @xmath8 , the system displays global cooperative behavior ( i.e. , partial or complete synchronization of the phases ) .    among other problems related to ( 1 ) that we shall also consider are the case where there is a sinusoidal periodic external drive of strength @xmath9 added to the righthand side of ( 1 ) ( see refs.@xcite and @xcite ) , @xmath10 and the case where there are several communities of different kinds of oscillators where the evolution of the phases @xmath11 of oscillators in community @xmath12 is given by ( see refs.@xcite ) @xmath13 here @xmath14,@xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 is the number of oscillators of type @xmath12 , and @xmath17 is the strength of the coupling from oscillators in community @xmath18 to oscillators in community @xmath12 . for all three cases ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) ) , we are interested in the limit @xmath19",
    ". we will also consider such problems with time delayed coupling ( e.g. , @xmath20 in eqs .",
    "( 1)(3 ) ) .    the problem stated in eq .",
    "( 2 ) was first considered by sakaguchi@xcite .",
    "it can , for example , be motivated as a model of circadian rhythm@xcite .",
    "circadian rhythm in mammals is governed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus that is located in the brain and consists of a large population of oscillatory neurons .",
    "these neurons presumably couple with each other and are also influenced ( though the optic nerve ) by the daily variation of sunlight ( modeled by the term in ( 2 ) involving @xmath9 ) . in @xcite , we found numerical and analytical evidence that the bifurcations and macroscopic dynamics of ( 2 ) with large @xmath21 appeared to be similar to what might be expected for the dynamics of a two dimensional dynamical system .",
    "this observation was the motivation for the present paper .",
    "the problem stated in eq .",
    "( 3 ) has been previously considered in refs.@xcite and @xcite where the linear stability of the incoherent state was investigated along with numerical solutions for the nonlinear evolution .",
    "considering the limit @xmath6 , the state of the oscillator system at time @xmath22 can be described by a continuous distribution function , @xmath23 , in frequency @xmath24 and phase @xmath25 for the problems in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) or by @xmath26 with @xmath27 for the problem in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are time independent oscillator frequency distributions .",
    "our main result is as follows . for initial distribution functions @xmath31",
    "satisfying a certain set of conditions that we will specify later in this paper , we show that    1 .   the evolution of @xmath23 from @xmath32 continues to satisfy the specified conditions , 2 .   for appropriate @xmath29 [ or @xmath33",
    ", the macroscopic system state obeys a finite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations , which we obtain explicitly .",
    "concerning ( i ) , we define a distribution function @xmath34 as a function for which @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the distribution functions @xmath37 satisfying our conditions form a manifold @xmath38 in the space @xmath39 of all possible distribution functions .",
    "what point ( i ) says is that initial states in @xmath40 evolve to other states in @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath38 is ` invariant ' under the dynamics .",
    "concerning point ( ii ) , we use the so - called ` order - parameter ' description to define the macroscopic system state .",
    "we define the order parameter ( or parameters in the case of eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) subsequently ( eq .  ( 5 ) ) in terms of an integral over the distribution function @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 for ( 3 ) ) , where this order - parameter integral globally quantifies the degree to which the entire ensemble of oscillators ( or ensembles @xmath12 for ( 3 ) ) behaves in a coherent manner .",
    "according to point ( ii ) the evolution of the order parameters is exactly finite dimensional even though the manifold @xmath38 and the dynamics of the distribution function @xmath41 as it evolves in @xmath38 are infinite dimensional .",
    "the macroscopic dynamics we obtain allows for much simplified investigation of the systems we study .",
    "for example , we obtain an exact closed form solution for the nonlinear time evolution of the kuramoto problem , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , for the case of lorentzian @xmath43",
    ". our formulation will be practically useful if at least some of the macroscopic order - parameter attractors and bifurcations of the full dynamics in the space @xmath39 are replicated in @xmath38 . in this regard",
    ", we note that numerical solutions of the system ( 2 ) for large @xmath21 have been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the resulting macroscopic order - parameter attractors , as well as their bifurcations with variation of system parameters , have been fully mapped out . comparing these numerical results for the full system ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) with results for the corresponding low dimensional system for the dynamics on @xmath38 ( eq .  ( 14 ) ) , we find that _ all _ ( not just some ) of the macroscopic order - parameter attractors and bifurcations of eq .",
    "( 2 ) with lorentzian @xmath29 are precisely and quantitatively captured by examination of the dynamics on @xmath38 .",
    "these results for the problem given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) suggest that our approach may be useful for other situations such as eqs .",
    "another notable point is that ref .",
    "@xcite also reports numerical simulation results for eq .",
    "( 2 ) with large @xmath21 for the case of a gaussian oscillator distribution function , @xmath44 $ ] , and the macroscopic order - parameter attractors and bifurcations in this case are found to be the same as those in the lorentzian case ( albeit at different parameter values ) .",
    "thus , at least for problem ( 2 ) , phenomena for lorentzian @xmath29 are not special and should give a useful indication of what can be expected for other unimodal distributions @xmath29 .",
    "we now support points ( i ) and ( ii ) for the case of the kuramoto problem , eq .  ( 1 ) . following that",
    ", we will consider other problems , including those associated with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . because of its relative simplicity , in this section we use the kuramoto problem as an example , but we emphasize that our interest is primarily in developing a method that will be useful in less simple cases , such as the problems stated in eqs .  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ( see sec .",
    "iv ) . following kuramoto@xcite",

    "we now consider a restricted class of @xmath55 such that @xmath56 where @xmath57 to avoid divergence of the series . substituting this series expansion into eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , we find the remarkable result that this special form of @xmath41 represents a solution to ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) if @xmath58 @xmath59 thus this special initial condition reduces the @xmath60-dependent system , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) to a problem ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) that is @xmath61-independent . however , we emphasize that eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) still constitute an infinite dimensional dynamical system becuase any initial condition is a _ function _ of @xmath24 , namely @xmath62 . performing the summation of the fourier series using @xmath63",
    ", we obtain @xmath64 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 real . for @xmath67 we can explicitly verify from eq .",
    "( 8) that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and that as @xmath70 we have @xmath71 .",
    "in order that eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) represent a solution of eq .",
    "( 5 ) for all finite time , we require that , as @xmath72 evolves under eqs .  ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) that @xmath73 continues to be satisfied .",
    "this can be shown by substituting @xmath74 into eq .",
    "( 6 ) , multiplying by @xmath75 , and taking the real part of the result , thus obtaining @xmath76=0 \\ .\\ ] ] we see from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that @xmath77 at @xmath78",
    ". hence a trajectory of ( 6 ) , starting with an initial condition satisfying @xmath79 can not cross the unit circle in the complex @xmath80-plane , and we have @xmath81 for all finite time , @xmath82 .    one way to motivate our ansatz , @xmath83 , is to note that the well - known stationary states of the kuramoto model@xcite , both the incoherent state ( @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath85 ) and the partially synchronized state with @xmath86 , both conform to @xmath83 .",
    "thus one view of the ansatz is that it specifies a family of distribution functions that connect these two states in a natural way .    to proceed further ,",
    "we now introduce another restriction on our assumed form of @xmath41 : we require that @xmath87 be analytically continuable from real @xmath24 into the complex @xmath24-plane , that this continuation has no singularities in the lower half @xmath88-plane , and that @xmath89 as @xmath90 . if these conditions are satisfied for the initial condition , @xmath91 , then they are also satisfied for @xmath72 for @xmath92 . to see that this is so",
    ", we first note that for large negative @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( 6 ) is approximately @xmath94 , and thus @xmath95 as @xmath96 will continue to be satisfied if @xmath97 as @xmath98 .",
    "next we note from@xcite that @xmath87 is analytic in any region of the complex @xmath24-plane for which @xmath99 is analytic provided that the solution @xmath87 to eq .",
    "( 6 ) exists .",
    "to establish existence for @xmath100 it suffices to show that the solution to eq .",
    "( 6 ) can not become infinite at a finite value of @xmath22 .",
    "this can be ruled out by noting that our derivation of ( 9 ) with @xmath24 now complex carries through except that there is now an addition term @xmath101 on the left hand side of the equation .",
    "thus at @xmath78 we have @xmath102 , and we conclude that , if @xmath79 everywhere in the lower half complex @xmath24-plane , then @xmath81 for all finite time @xmath103 everywhere in the lower half complex @xmath24-plane .    regarding the initial condition @xmath104 , we note that , if @xmath105 for @xmath24 real , if the continuation @xmath104 is analytic everywhere in the lower half @xmath24-plane , and if the continuation satisfies @xmath106 as @xmath96 , then the continuation satisfies @xmath79 everywhere in the lower half complex @xmath24-plane@xcite .",
    "examples of possible initial conditions are @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 with @xmath111 , and @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "we can now specify the invariant manifold @xmath38 on which our dynamics takes place .",
    "it is the space of functions of the real variables @xmath114 of the form given by eq .",
    "( 8) where @xmath115 for real @xmath24 ; @xmath72 can be analytically continued from the real @xmath24-axis into the lower half @xmath24-plane ; and , when continued into the lower half @xmath24-plane , @xmath87 has no singularities there and approaches zero as @xmath116 .    now taking @xmath29 to be lorentzian @xmath117^{-1 } \\ , \\ ] ] we can do the @xmath24 integral in eq .",
    "( 7 ) by closing the contour by a large semicircle in the lower half @xmath88-plane . writing @xmath118 $ ] , we see that the integral is given by the residue of the pole at @xmath119 . by a change of variables @xmath120 , we can , without loss of generality set @xmath121 , @xmath122 . thus we obtain @xmath123 . putting this result into eq .",
    "( 6 ) and setting @xmath124 , we obtain the nonlinear evolution of the order parameter @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 real ) : @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "thus the dynamics is described by the single real nonlinear , first order , ordinary differential equation , eq .",

    "we see that for @xmath132 , the order parameter goes to zero exponentially with increasing time , while for @xmath133 it exponentially asymptotes to the finite value @xmath134^{1/2}$ ] , in agreement with the known time - asymptotic results for the case @xmath135 ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite )",
    ". plots of the nonlinear evolution of @xmath136 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "linearization of eq .",
    "( 10 ) yields an exponential damping rate of @xmath137 $ ] for perturbations around @xmath138 for @xmath139 , which becomes unstable for @xmath140 , at which point the stable nonlinear equilibrium at @xmath141 comes into existence . for @xmath142 linearization of ( 10 ) around the equilibrium @xmath141",
    "yields a corresponding perturbation damping rate @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath135 the latter damping rate can also be obtained from the recent stability analyses of solutions of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our solution for @xmath50 obeys two uncoupled first order real ordinary differential equations ( eq .",
    "( 10 ) and @xmath129 ) , while the problem for @xmath87 ( eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ) is an infinite dimensional dynamical system ( i.e. , to obtain @xmath87 we need to specify an initial _ function _ of @xmath24 , @xmath104 ) .",
    "this is further reflected by the fact that linearization of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) about their equilibria yields a problem with a continuous spectrum of neutral modes@xcite .",
    "thus the microscopic dynamics in @xmath38 of the distribution function is infinite dimensional , while the macroscopic dynamics of the order parameter is low dimensional .",
    "_ a. other distributions @xmath29 _    so far we have restricted our discussion to the case of the lorentzian @xmath144 .",
    "we now consider @xmath145 which decreases with increasing @xmath24 as @xmath146 , in contrast to @xmath144 which decreases as @xmath147 .",

    "indeed , the above considerations can be applied to any @xmath29 that is a rational function of @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are polynomials in @xmath24 ) .",

    "the equilibria obtained for eq .",
    "( 14 ) and their stability are the same as obtained by the analysis of the full system ( 13 ) as performed in ref.@xcite . furthermore , the bifurcations and stability of the limit cycle are the same as numerically found in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , for this problem , it appears that the important observable macroscopic dynamics is contained entirely within the invariant manifold @xmath38 .    _",
    "c. communities of oscillators _    turning now to the problem of coupled communities of kuramoto systems given by eq .",

    "we conjecture that , for @xmath15 large enough [ e.g. , @xmath175 or @xmath176 and appropriate parameter values , there may be chaotic attracting solutions for eq .",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to see whether such solutions in @xmath38 are also attractors for the macroscopic order - parameter behavior of the full system ( 3 ) , e.g. , by comparing numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 15 ) .    _",
    "d. time - delayed coupling _    in applications time delay in the coupling between dynamical units in a network is often present .",
    "for example , the propagation speed of signals between units is finite ( e.g. , along axons in a neural network ) , and there may also be an inherent response time of a unit to information that it receives .",
    "thus time delay has been extensively studied in the context of networks of coupled systems , and in particular for the case of coupled phase oscillators@xcite .",
    "it has been found for such systems that time delay can substantially modify the dynamics , leading to a much richer variety of behaviors . in the context of eqs .",
    "( 1)(3 ) , for example , the response of oscillator @xmath1 at time @xmath22 to input from oscillator @xmath177 is now related to the state @xmath178 of oscillator @xmath177 at time @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the time delay for this interaction .",

    "<S> it is shown that , in the infinite size limit , certain systems of globally coupled phase oscillators display low dimensional dynamics . in particular , we derive an explicit finite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the macroscopic evolution of the systems considered . </S>",
    "<S> for example , an exact , closed form solution for the nonlinear time evolution of the kuramoto problem with a lorentzian oscillator frequency distribution function is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> low dimensional behavior is also demonstrated for several prototypical extensions of the kuramoto model , and time - delayed coupling is also considered .    * because synchronous behavior in large groups consisting of many coupled oscillators has been widely observed in many situations , the behavior of such systems has long been of interest . </S>",
    "<S> since the problem is difficult to solve in general , much work has been done on the simple paradigmatic case of globally coupled phase oscillators . even in this simple context , </S>",
    "<S> however , much remains unclear , particularly when considering situations in which a large oscillator population interacts with external dynamical systems , or when there are communities of interacting oscillators with different community and connection characteristics , etc . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider an approach that allows the study of the time evolving dynamical behavior of these types of systems by an exact reduction to a small number of ordinary differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction is achieved by considering a restricted class of states . in spite of this restriction , for at least one significant example [ see preceding article ] , consideration of our derived ordinary differential equations appears to yield dynamics in precise agreement with results obtained from considerations not imposing this restriction . </S>",
    "<S> thus we believe that our results may be useful in many other contexts . * </S>"
