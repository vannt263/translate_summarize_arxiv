    "the authors of ref .   reported that their experimental observations agree with the numerical simulations that demonstrated the existence of the large amplitude oscillatory motions in a lid - driven cavity flow .",
    "there are several studies on lid driven cavity flow with stable stratification .",
    "results of comprehensive experimental studies of flow patterns and mixing in a stably - stratified , lid - driven water cavity flow were reported in ref .  .",
    "these experiments were conducted in the range of reynolds number from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and in the range of the bulk richardson numbers from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "stable stratification was controlled by varying temperatures of the upper and bottom walls of the cavity .",
    "the authors observed a strongly three dimensional flow with tgl vortices which was partially turbulent .",
    "experiments revealed the existence of the primary and secondary circulation cells with alternating sign of vorticity .",
    "three - dimensional numerical simulation in a shallow driven cavity have been conducted for a stably stratified fluid heated from the top moving wall and cooled from below for a wide range of rayleigh numbers and richardson numbers ( see ref .  ) .",
    "it was found that an increase of the buoyancy force prevents the return flow from penetrating to the bottom of the cavity .",
    "the fluid is recirculated at the upper portion of the cavity , and the upper recirculation induces shear on the lower fluid layer and forms another weak recirculated flow region .",

    "it was found that when the richardson number is very small , the gross flow characteristics are akin to the conventional driven - cavity flows , as addressed by earlier studies . in this case",
    "the isotherm surfaces maintain a fair degree of two - dimensionality .",
    "when the richardson number increases , the primary and meridional flows are confined to the upper region of the cavity . in the middle and lower parts of the cavity , fluid tends to be stagnant , and heat transfer is mostly conductive .",

    "the vortices appear to enhance the mixing as they convolute the interface . in the unstably stratified flow , where",
    "the forced and free convection effects are approximately in balance , the taylor - gortler vortices are still formed .",
    "however , there are a few taylor - gortler vortex pairs and their size is small .",
    "the taylor - gortler vortices arise in the region of the downstream secondary eddy and corner vortices along the end - walls . at higher reynolds numbers",
    "@xmath6 the flow is unsteady in the region of the downstream secondary eddy and exhibits some turbulent properties .",
    "stably stratified sheared turbulent flows are of a great importance in atmospheric physics .",
    "since richardson ( 1920 ) , it was generally believed that in stationary homogeneous atmospheric flows the velocity shear becomes incapable of maintaining turbulence when the richardson number exceeds some critical value ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the latter assertion , however , contradicts to atmospheric measurements , experimental evidence and numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "recently an insight into this long - standing problem has been gained through more rigorous analysis of the turbulent energetics involving additional budget equations for the turbulent potential energy and turbulent heat flux , and accounting for the energy exchange between turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent potential energy ( see , refs .  ) .",
    "this analysis opens new prospects toward developing consistent and practically useful turbulent closures for stably stratified sheared turbulent flows .",

    "there are several factors that can cause a slight asymmetry of the mean flow in @xmath7 plane , in particular for @xmath56 .",
    "one of the factors can be related with slight geometric imperfections of the experimental cell .",
    "another possible reason is associated with the effect of excitation of the large - scale vorticity in a non - stratified turbulence with a large - scale shear ( see refs .  ) .",
    "temperature stratification may mitigate this effect .",
    "the latter assertion is supported by the mean velocity maps in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( see lower panel , @xmath57 k ) where the large - scale velocity pattern in @xmath7 plane is quite symmetric .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between three regions in the mean flow for @xmath58 k or @xmath59 ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) : a relatively strong mean flow in the upper part of the cavity including a main vortex in its left side , a mean sheared flow with a lesser mean velocity in its right side , and a very weak mean flow in the rest of the cavity .",
    "therefore , when the strength of stable stratification increases and the bulk richardson number , @xmath60 , increases up to 0.3 , the main vortex tends to be confined to a small zone close to the sliding top lid and to the left wall of the cavity .",
    "the stable stratification suppresses the vertical mean motions , and , therefore , the impact of the sliding top wall penetrates to the smaller depth into the fluid . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , when @xmath60 is not small , the mean flow in the middle and lower parts of the cavity interior is weak , and much of the fluid remains almost stagnant . the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] demonstrates this trend .",
    "the mean flow is almost stagnant in the bulk of the cavity interior excluding the region close to the sliding top wall .",
    "the mean flows obtained in our experiment are three - dimensional .",
    "however , inspection of the mean flow patterns in @xmath17 ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) and @xmath7 planes ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) reveals that the energy of the mean flow in @xmath17 plane is by at least one order of magnitude larger than the mean flow energy in @xmath7 plane .",
    "therefore , the flow is not strongly three - dimensional with respect to the mean flow energy in these two planes .",
    "moreover , inspection of the velocity maps in @xmath7 cross - section ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] , panels for @xmath51 k and @xmath57 k ) shows that the flow is nearly symmetric and homogeneous in the central part .",
    "we also observed that the measured velocity maps in @xmath17 cross - sections for different coordinate @xmath55 are quite close , and a slight difference was observed only at the distance of about 3.7 cm from the side walls .",
    "therefore , we believe that the choice of the mid plane provides a good representation of the core flow in the cavity .    in fig .  [ fig14 ] we show vertical temperature profiles measured in the central @xmath17 plane for several values of coordinate @xmath31",
    ". inspection of these temperature profiles reveals the existence of two distinctive parts in the temperature dependence on vertical coordinate z. temperature varies strongly in the bottom stagnant part of the flow with a stable stratification .",
    "vertical temperature gradient varies from 1.7 k / cm ( at @xmath31 = 2.5 cm ) under the main vortex to 1.15 k / cm ( at @xmath31 = 14 cm and @xmath31 = 22 cm ) under a sheared part of the flow ( tail of the vortex ) .",
    "vertical temperature gradient decreases sharply to 0.2 k / cm inside the sheared part of the flow . remarkably , vertical temperature gradient changes sign inside the main vortex ( see the plots in fig .",
