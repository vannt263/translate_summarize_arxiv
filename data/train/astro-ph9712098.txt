    "three  dimensional patterns formed by the spatial distribution of galaxies in the universe have already been described and quantified by various methods : correlation functions , counts  in  cells @xcite , the void probability function @xcite , the genus @xcite , the multifractal spectrum @xcite , skewness and kurtosis @xcite , and minkowski functionals ( , ) .",
    "some of these descriptors are complementary and suggest a physical interpretation of cosmic patterns by emphasising different spatial features of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the treatment of the galaxy distribution as a realization of a spatial point process promises useful insights through the application of methods from the field of spatial statistics .",
    "the forthcoming three  dimensional galaxy catalogues with more than half a million redshifts additionally motivate the development of new statistical techniques .    in this article",
    "we want to reinforce a morphological measure for the study of the distribution of galaxies , the @xmath1function , which has recently been introduced into the field of spatial statistics by and is related to the nearest  neighbor distribution @xmath2 and the spherical contact distribution @xmath3 . indeed , the @xmath1function is equal to the first conditional correlation function ( , ) , and was used by to test a hierarchical ansatz for @xmath4point correlation functions .",
    "we will focus on different features of the @xmath1function showing its discriminative power as a measure of the strength of clustering .",
    "our article is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect : nearest ] we present the distribution functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 and show how the @xmath0 function is constructed .",
    "a matrn cluster process is considered as a simple example of a clustering point distribution . in sect .",
    "[ sect : galaxies ] we study the clustering properties of a galaxy sample and of galaxies in groups extracted from the perseus ",
    "pisces redshift survey ( pps ) .",
    "we compare the observed galaxy distribution with mock samples extracted from a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) simulation in sect .",
    "[ sect : nbody ] .",
    "we summarise and conclude in sect .",
    "[ sect : outlook ] .",
    "in the theory of spatial point processes the distribution of a point s distance to its nearest neighbor is a common tool for the analysis of point patterns @xcite .",
    "we consider the redshift space coordinates @xmath7 of @xmath8 galaxies inside a region @xmath9 as a realization of the point process describing the spatial distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "the nearest neighbor distribution @xmath2 is the distribution function of the distance @xmath10 of a point of the process to the nearest other point of the process .",
    "similarly , the spherical contact distribution @xmath3 is the distribution function of the distance @xmath10 of an arbitrary point in @xmath11 to the nearest point of the process .",
    "@xmath3 is equal to the volume fraction occupied by the set of all points in @xmath12 which are closer than @xmath10 to a point of the process .",
    "hence , @xmath3 coincides with the volume density of the first minkowski functional ( and ) and is related to the void probability function @xmath13 via @xmath14 .    for a homogeneous poisson process",
    "we have @xmath15 where @xmath4 is the number density . boundary",
    " corrected estimators for both the nearest neighbor distribution and the spherical contact distribution used in our studies are provided by minus ( reduced sample ) estimators ( , also detailed in ) .    in a recent paper , have suggested to use the quotient @xmath16 for characterising a point process ; in that way the surroundings of a point belonging to the process and the neighborhood of a random point are compared .",
    "they consider several point process models and provide limits and exact results on @xmath1 ( see also section  [ sect : matern ] ) .",
    "if the process under consideration is clustered , an arbitrary point usually lies farther away from a point of the process than in the case of a poisson process .",
    "hence , clustering is indicated by @xmath17 .",
    "consistently , @xmath18 , since clustered points tend to lie closer to their nearest neighbors than randomly distributed points .",
    "so , for a clustered point distribution , @xmath19 .    in case of anti  correlated , `` regular '' structures the situation is the opposite : on average a point of a regular process is farther away from the nearest other point of the process , so @xmath20 , and a random point is closer to a point of the process , resulting in @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , regular structures are indicated by @xmath22 .    for a homogeneous poisson process",
    "we obtain @xmath23 , separating regular from clustering structures .      before attempting to apply @xmath1 to galaxy samples ,",
    "we want to test it on a model with non",
    " trivial yet analytically tractable behaviour of @xmath1 .    in order to describe the clustering of galaxies , suggested a class of point processes that was subsequently named after them .",
    "we concentrate on a subclass called matrn cluster processes .",
    "they are constructed by first distributing uniformly @xmath24 cluster centres . around each cluster centre , which is itself not included in the final point distribution , @xmath25 galaxies are placed randomly within a sphere of radius @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is a poisson distributed random variable with mean @xmath27 . in figure",
    "[ fig : matern ] we show a sketch of such a process .",
    "note that overlapping clusters are allowed",
    ".    for a matrn cluster process , proved that @xmath1 is monotonically decreasing from 1 at @xmath28 and attains a constant value for @xmath29 , where @xmath26 is the radius of a cluster .",
    "this constant value can be interpreted as a relic of the uniform distribution of the cluster centres . in three dimensions @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the ratio of the volume of the intersection of two balls to the volume of a single ball . here",
    "@xmath32 is a ball of radius @xmath10 centred at the point @xmath33 , while @xmath34 is a ball of radius @xmath26 centred at the origin .",
    "this quantity can be calculated from basic geometric considerations , both in two @xcite and in three dimensions , where the result is @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37    in figure  [ fig : jmatern ] we show denotes the value of the hubble parameter measured in units of @xmath38 . ]",
    "@xmath39 for @xmath40 and several values of @xmath27 ; this represents typical situations of galaxy clustering .",
    "obviously @xmath1 discriminates between the varying richness classes of the matrn cluster processes .",
    "in this section we want to go one step further by applying @xmath1 to catalogues of galaxies and groups of galaxies , and compare them with a matrn cluster process .",
    "the pps database was compiled in the last decade ( , ) .",
    "the full redshift survey is magnitude  limited down to a zwicky magnitude of @xmath41 @xcite , and at least 95% complete to @xmath42 ( see figure  1 in ) .",
    "we extract a volume  limited subsample with @xmath43 and radius @xmath44 , confined to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e.  a solid angle of @xmath47 .",
    "redshifts are corrected for the motion of the sun relative to the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as in , and we also correct zwicky magnitudes for interstellar extinction as in . the final volume ",
    "limited sample pps79 contains 817 galaxies .    to find groups , we use the redshift space friends  of  friends algorithm of , suitably adapted to our case .",
    "it is a truncated percolation algorithm with two independent linking parameters @xmath12 and @xmath48 .",
    "briefly , two galaxies are `` friends '' if their transverse and radial separations @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfy @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "friendship is transitive , and a set of _ three _ or more friends is called a loose group of galaxies .    usually , loose groups are identified in magnitude  limited samples . here",
    ", we consider only volume  limited samples .",
    "values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 give very good agreement of global properties ( e.g.  the total fraction of galaxies in groups , the ratio of groups to galaxies , or the median velocity dispersion ) between our volume  limited group catalogue and the magnitude  limited catalogue constructed by .",
    "the final sample contains 230 galaxies in 48 loose groups .",
    "a typical group has 5 observed members , a `` virial mass '' of some @xmath55 , and an observed luminosity of some @xmath56 .",
    "both its radius and its inter  member pairwise separation are around @xmath57 , and the line  of  sight velocity dispersion amounts to roughly @xmath58 , so the groups appear thin and elongated in redshift space .",
    "we calculated @xmath1 for all galaxies from the pps79 sample ; the results are shown in figure  [ fig : j_pps_gal ] . with @xmath1 lying outside the area occupied by realizations of a poisson process , one can clearly see that galaxies are strongly clustered  not a particularly surprising result . in sect .",
    "[ sect : pps - simulation ] , somewhat more interesting comparisons with galaxy mock ",
    "samples extracted from @xmath8body simulations are performed .",
    "figure  [ fig : j_pps_gr ] displays the results for grouped galaxies . since each group contains at least three members , the nearest neighbour of a grouped galaxy is certainly found within the largest link length used in the friends  of  friends procedure .",
    "hence we observe @xmath59 and subsequently @xmath60 for @xmath61 in the grouped galaxy sample .",
    "@xmath1 is in general _ not _ invariant under changes of the number density @xcite . to compare the @xmath1 for grouped galaxies with the @xmath1 for all galaxies , we subsample the denser pps79",
    ". @xmath1 is calculated from 50 subsamples of 230 galaxies randomly selected from the whole pps79 sample . with @xmath1",
    "we measure the strength of clustering , which is emphasised when we consider galaxies in groups only , and is less pronounced when we look at the whole sample with field galaxies included .",
    "similarly the value of @xmath1 for the sub ",
    "sampled pps79 is higher than @xmath1 for the whole pps79 , because random sub  sampling ( thinning ) tends to increase @xmath1 towards the poisson value .",
    "the centers of loose groups show a strong correlation themselves @xcite , therefore a matrn cluster process can only serve as a rough approximation to the true distribution of galaxies in groups . despite this",
    ", a matrn cluster process with @xmath62 galaxies per group ( cluster ) and a group radius of @xmath40 shows a @xmath1 comparable to the @xmath1 obtained from the galaxies in groups , where in the mean 4.8 galaxies reside in a group ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jmatern ] ) .",
    "we see a low , almost constant value of @xmath1 for @xmath63 .",
    "this suggests that we are indeed looking at highly clustered galaxies with small contamination by `` field '' galaxies .",
    "the @xmath64 of a matrn cluster process gets constant for radii twice as large as the cluster radius .",
    "already , express their hope to deduce a cluster scale @xmath26 in a point distribution from @xmath65 .",
    "however , this must be taken with extreme caution .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : jmatern ] we may be fooled by a factor of three by the fluctuations in the estimated @xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty becomes even worse when we consider certain cox  processes , where @xmath1 decreases strictly monotonically towards a constant value @xcite , and in principle no scale can be deduced from the comparison with the oversimplified matrn cluster process .",
    "either we have to restrict ourselves to qualitative statements , or come up with more refined and realistic models .",
    "the preceding section showed that the qualitative features of the galaxy distribution are well described by the @xmath0function . in this section",
    "we explicate that the @xmath0function is also suitable for a quantitative comparison , and allows us to constrain cosmological models .",
    "we extract 64 mock ",
    "pps catalogues from a cosmological n  body simulation of a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) model .",
    "we consider a mdm model with one species of massive neutrinos , dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath66 and density parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 for cold and hot dark matter , respectively .",
    "the analytical expressions for the mdm power spectra @xmath69 was taken from .",
    "the initial @xmath69 was normalised to the cobe 4-yr data @xcite , giving a corresponding value of @xmath70 for the r.m.s .",
    "mass fluctuation in an @xmath71 sphere .",
    "the simulation was run from an initial expansion factor @xmath72 down to @xmath73 using a p@xmath74 m code with @xmath75 particles of mass @xmath76 , on a cubic grid of @xmath77 cells , with a force softening radius @xmath78 , in a box of side @xmath79 .",
    "the integration was performed in comoving coordinates using @xmath80 as time variable for a total of 225 steps .",
    "we identify `` galaxies '' in our simulation with a method similar to the one discussed by :    first , we associate with each particle a number @xmath81 of galaxy  scale peaks calculated from the initial density contrast field @xmath82 . in the peak  background split approximation ( , , ) @xmath81 is the number of galaxy peaks with height @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the field smoothed with a gaussian kernel of width @xmath85 , and @xmath86 gives the smoothed field s variance .",
    "the field is subject to the constraint that it takes the value @xmath87 when smoothed on a scale @xmath88 ( see for more details ) .",
    "choosing @xmath89 , at @xmath90 the particle two  point correlation function , weighted according to @xmath81 , matches in slope and amplitude the galaxy two  point correlation function . for the adopted parameters ,",
    "the total number of peaks in the box is @xmath91 .",
    "then , we select the @xmath92th particle as a galaxy if @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a uniformly distributed random variable , and @xmath95 is a constant of proportionality . the latter is set by the requirement that the mean number density of `` galaxies '' in the box matches the mean density of @xmath96 galaxies expected from the schechter luminosity function with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99mpc@xmath100 appropriate for pps (; ) .",
    "this monte ",
    "carlo procedure makes the implicit assumption that the higher the peak , the more luminous the associated galaxy .",
    "the mock  pps catalogues were built as follows .",
    "the simulation cube was divided into @xmath101 sub  cubes of side length @xmath102 . within each sub  cube we fit a pps  like wedge of radius @xmath44 .",
    "space coordinates @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 were assigned to all the `` galaxies '' of the sub  cubes .",
    "finally , we kept only the `` galaxies '' within the redshift  space ",
    "boundaries of the mock  pps catalogues .",
    "although we are looking at a large volume with a depth 79  and a solid angle of @xmath47 , we observe large fluctuations of 25% in the number of points per mock  sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : counts_histogram ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the large  scale fluctuations of the clustering properties of iras galaxies , as found by out to scales of 200 , and expresses cosmic variance in agreement with expected sample  to  sample variations @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this slightly complicates the analysis .      at first",
    "we investigate the mock ",
    "samples selected in redshift  space .",
    "if we use all the 64 mock  samples we are dominated by the fluctuations between samples with a different number density ( see fig .  [ fig : red - all - simul ] ) . therefore , we restrict ourselves to mock  samples with approximately the same number of points as in the observed galaxy sample : @xmath106 , with @xmath107 . for @xmath108 only six samples",
    "enter , whereas for @xmath109 we already have seventeen mock ",
    "samples to analyse .",
    "the mean value of @xmath1 hardly changes between samples with different @xmath110 .",
    "obviously , samples with low density tend to be centred on voids , and high  density samples typically include large , coma  like clusters .",
    "so large fluctuations in the number density lead to large fluctuations in the clustering properties measured by @xmath1 but cancel in the mean .",
    "these fluctuations decrease for smaller @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : red - all - simul ] ; this was confirmed by inspecting samples with @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) . in order to look at structures comparable to the pps sample we consider mock ",
    "samples with a similar number density as in the observed galaxy sample , and do not subsample the mock  samples with high number density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - red - data ] the results of the mock  samples in real and redshift  space are compared .",
    "samples selected in redshift  space show a weaker clustering than mock ",
    "samples selected in real  space on small scales out to at least @xmath113 , as can be deduced from the higher @xmath1 . this can be traced back to redshift space distortions .",
    "the peculiar motions act by erasing small scale clustering ; therefore the j value of redshift - space samples is larger ( less clustering ) than that of real - space samples .",
    "this effect changes at a given distance ( 2 ) .",
    "the same effect was found by in volume  limited subsamples , extracted from cfa - i , by means of the two  point correlation function .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift - data ] the results of the mock  samples in redshift ",
    "space are compared with the results of the observed galaxy distribution in the pps .",
    "the mock  samples show insufficient clustering on small scales out to at least @xmath114 , as can be deduced from the higher @xmath1 .",
    "this is probably due to the high velocity dispersion in mdm models @xcite . in real  space , which is",
    "_ not _ directly comparable with the pps data , the mock  samples reproduce the clustering on small scales out to 1 , but again show not enough clustering , even though they become marginally consistent with the observed galaxy distribution on larger scales .",
    "we have to conclude that this mdm simulation is unable to reproduce the observed strong clustering of galaxies on small scales .",
    "of course this result depends on our method of galaxy identification .",
    "a different biasing prescription might change this . on large scales",
    "a definitive answer is not possible , since for @xmath10 larger than 6  an estimation of @xmath1 becomes unreliable ; the empirical @xmath2 and @xmath3 approach unity , and the quotient @xmath1 is ill  defined .",
    "we have highlighted promising properties of the global morphological descriptor @xmath1 .",
    "it connects the distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 and , hence , incorporates all orders of correlation functions .",
    "@xmath1 measures the strength of clustering in a point process and distinguishes between correlated and anti  correlated patterns .",
    "the example of a matrn cluster process illustrates that @xmath1 sensitively depends on the richness of the clusters or groups .",
    "since @xmath1 is built from cumulated distribution functions , we do not encounter spurious results due to binning .",
    "this becomes particularly important on small scales .",
    "the application of the @xmath0-function to galaxies in a volume limited sample and to a sample of galaxies in loose groups clearly showed the stronger clustering of galaxies in groups . in a comparison with a matrn cluster we found that internal properties , like the richness of loose groups , are satisfactorily modelled .",
    "however , for the large  scale distribution of galaxies , the matrn cluster process clearly is an over  simplification .",
    "we used the @xmath0-function for a comparison of the observed galaxy distribution with galaxy mock  samples .",
    "although the mock  samples extracted from a mdm  simulation cover a large volume , we detected large fluctuations of the order of 25% in the number of points per sample .",
    "on small scales , out to 1 , the clustering in real  space is as strong as in the observed galaxy distribution , but the comparable redshift  space mock  samples show too weak clustering . on larger scales from 26",
    "both real and redshift  space mock  samples show too weak clustering .",
    "hence , this mdm simulation is not able to reproduce the observed strong clustering of the galaxies on small scales .",
    "the function @xmath1 has proved to achieve comparable discriminative power as the minkowski functionals @xcite , and is most suitable for addressing the question of `` regularity '' on large  scales as demonstrated in an analysis of the distribution of superclusters @xcite . in this article",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1 function is a useful tool for quantifying the clustering of galaxies on small scales and is capable of constraining cosmological models of structure formation .",
