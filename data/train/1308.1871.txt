    "magnetic reconnection is arguably one of the most important processes in plasma physics , which provides a mechanism to release the energy stored in magnetic field and convert it to thermal energy or bulk plasma kinetic energy .",
    "it is generally believed to be the underlying mechanism that powers explosive events such as solar flares , magnetospheric substorms , and sawtooth crashes in fusion plasmas.@xcite the key challenge of magnetic reconnection theory applied to these events is how energy can be released explosively in time scales that are very short compared with the characteristic resistive diffusion time scale .    traditionally , it was widely accepted that magnetic reconnection in the resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model is described by the classical sweet - parker theory.@xcite sweet - parker theory predicts that reconnection rate scales as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lundquist number ( here @xmath3 is the upstream alfvn speed , @xmath2 is the reconnection layer length , and @xmath12 is the resistivity ) . because the lundquist number @xmath13 is usual very high ( e.g. in solar corona @xmath14 , assuming the classical spitzer resistivity ) , the sweet - parker reconnection rate is too slow to account for energy release events . for this reason ,",
    "research on fast reconnection in the past two decades has mostly focused on collisionless reconnection , which can yield reconnection rates as fast as @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 is the upstream magnetic field).@xcite in order to trigger collisionless reconnection , the current sheet width has to first go down to kinetic scales such as the ion skin depth or ion thermal gyroradius.@xcite    the super - alfvnic plasmoid instability,@xcite which is a secondary tearing instability acting on a sweet - parker current sheet , has drawn considerable interest in recent years .",
    "while the scaling features of this linear instability are surprising in their own right,@xcite what is more important is that the instability leads to a nonlinear regime in which the reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of @xmath13,@xcite in striking departure from the prediction of sweet - parker theory .",
    "furthermore , the plasmoid instability causes fragmentation of the sweet - parker current sheet to smaller secondary current sheets , which allows collisionless reconnection to be triggered earlier than previously thought possible.@xcite    over the past few years , the linear analysis of the plasmoid instability mediated by resistivity has been extended by various authors to include hall,@xcite three dimensional ( 3d),@xcite and shear flow effects.@xcite nonlinear evolution of the instability has also been extensively studied in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems.@xcite the resistive plasmoid instability in 2d is now relatively well understood . however , the resistive tearing mode is not the only mechanism that causes plasmoid formation .",
    "in fact , plasmoid formation has been found to be ubiquitous in large scale reconnection simulations , regardless of the underlying physical models .",

    "we focus on scalings of reconnection rate , the number of plasmoids , and the sizes of secondary current sheets .",
    "we give a heuristic justification for the scalings .",

    "there are some subtleties in making qualitative comparisons between the resistive and hyper - resistive plasmoid instabilities because the mechanisms that break the frozen - in condition are quite different in the two cases .",
    "a meaningful comparison may be made by rewriting the scaling laws in terms of the aspect ratio @xmath110 of the primary sweet - parker current sheet , which is a common feature for both models .",
    "for the resistive case , the maximum growth rate scales as @xmath111 and the fastest growing mode has a dimensionless wavenumber @xmath112 on the other hand , for the hyper - resistive plasmoid instability , the maximum growth rate scales as @xmath113 and the growth rate peaks when @xmath114 is within the range @xmath115 from these scaling laws we may conclude that the hyper - resistive plasmoid instability has a higher growth rate and prefers shorter wavelengths as compared to the resistive one .",
    "therefore , the hyper - resistive plasmoid instability is even more explosive , and more efficient in generating copious plasmoids , than the resistive plasmoid instability .",
    "the resistive plasmoid instability is of great interest because it leads to a nonlinear regime where magnetic reconnection is drastically different from the sweet - parker model .",

    "the density profile has a weak nonuniformity such that the initial condition is approximately force - balanced .",

    "[ fig : snapshots ] ]      before we study magnetic reconnection in fully nonlinear regime for this system , we first verify the prediction @xmath130 from the linear analysis .",
    "one difficulty in measuring the linear growth rate is due to the fact that we do not start the simulation with a sweet - parker current sheet .",
    "rather , the sweet - parker current sheet is established self - consistently during the current sheet thinning phase .",
    "therefore , the standard technique of adding a small perturbation to an initial equilibrium and measuring the growth rate as the perturbation grows does not apply here .",
    "the problem is that most physical quantities evolve quite substantially during the current sheet thinning phase before onset of the plasmoid instability , and it is difficult to filter out the variations that are not due to the growth of the plasmoid instability .",

    "a theoretical model was proposed that yields results consistent with the numerical simulations.@xcite it has been clarified that the transition from the power - law distribution to the exponential tail is due to the dominant plasmoid loss mechanism switching from coalescence to advection .",
    "this transition typically occurs when the cumulative distribution function @xmath143 obeys the approximately inequality @xmath144 , i.e. for the very largest plasmoids in each snapshot .",

    "<S> magnetic reconnection mediated by the hyper - resistive plasmoid instability is studied with both linear analysis and nonlinear simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the linear growth rate is found to scale as @xmath0 with respect to the hyper - resistive lundquist number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the system size , @xmath3 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath4 is the hyper - resistivity . in the nonlinear regime , </S>",
    "<S> reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of @xmath5 , the number of plasmoids scales as @xmath6 , and the secondary current sheet length and width both scale as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these scalings are consistent with a heuristic argument assuming secondary current sheets are close to marginal stability . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of plasmoids as a function of the enclosed flux @xmath8 is found to obey a @xmath9 power law over an extended range , followed by a rapid fall off for large plasmoids . </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared with those from resistive magnetohydrodynamic studies . </S>"
