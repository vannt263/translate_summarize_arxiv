    "<S> we studied magneto - optical response of a canonical topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 with the goal of addressing a controversial issue of electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic - field induced modifications of reflectance are very pronounced in the infrared part of the spectrum , indicating strong electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling causes an asymmetric line - shape of the 60  @xmath2 phonon mode , and is analyzed within the fano formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals that the fano asymmetry parameter ( q ) changes sign when the cyclotron resonance is degenerate with the phonon mode . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this is the first example of magnetic field driven q - reversal .    </S>",
    "<S> coupling of optical phonons to charge carriers in topological insulators is a topic of considerable current interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the topic is important from the fundamental point , as well as for potential practical applications of topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the problem has been studied with a variety of experimental techniques , including optical spectroscopy @xcite , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , time - domain thz spectroscopy @xcite and helium scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of phonons has also been studied theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> majority of the measurements have been done on a canonical 3d topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , but the results have been contradictory . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the reported values of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 vary in a broad range , from exceptionally weak @xcite to moderately strong @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use magneto - optical spectroscopy to address this controversial issue from another angle . </S>",
    "<S> our magneto - optical results reveal that charge carriers are indeed coupled to 60  @xmath2 optical phonon , and the coupling is causing an asymmetric line shape of the phonon . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that as the magnetic field increases , the lineshape asymmetry parameter ( q ) changes sign , from negative to positive . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is known from other branches of physics , and is referred to as the q - reversal . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the origin of q - reversal in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is the coupling of the phonon to a cyclotron resonance , whose frequency increases linearly with magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were grown at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were characterized with x - ray diffraction using a rigaku miniflex x - ray machine . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis showed that samples were single phase , and with lattice parameters consistent with the published values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> samples had a typical thickness of several millimeters and naturally flat surfaces , with surface area of about 4  mm @xmath4 4  mm . </S>",
    "<S> surfaces were cleaved before each spectroscopic measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> far - infrared magneto - reflectance ratios r(@xmath5,b)/r(@xmath5 , 0 t ) of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were collected at the national high magnetic field laboratory in magnetic fields as high as 18 t. magneto - optical spectra of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 have previously been reported only in magnetic field up to 8 t @xcite and only recently in higher magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reflectance ratios r(@xmath5,b)/r(@xmath5 , 0 t ) were supplemented with the zero field data to obtain the absolute values of reflectance in magnetic field r(@xmath5 , b ) , as the product of the ratios with the absolute value of reflectance in zero field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zero magnetic field far - infrared measurements on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were performed at the university of akron , and have been reported previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were performed with unpolarized light , with the electric field vector parallel to the planes .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : ratios](a ) shows the far - infrared reflectance ratios r(@xmath5 , b)/r(@xmath5 , 0 t ) in magnetic field up to 18 t , in steps of 1 t. these ratios provide the most direct evidence for magneto - optical sensitivity of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in the far - infrared part of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> large field - induced changes , as high as 75  @xmath6 , are detected around 220  @xmath2 , much larger than reported previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is another testimony to the excellent sample quality , which when combined with a high magnetic field allowed for the first time @xcite the observation of a cyclotron resonance in bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 samples . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclotron resonance in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has so far been observed only in thin films @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : ratios](b ) displays the absolute values of reflectance r(@xmath5,b ) obtained from the ratios and the zero - field absolute values . in zero field @xcite , the most prominent feature in reflectance is the plasma edge located at approximately 180  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , two optically active phonon modes , observed previously @xcite , are detected in the form of dips located at approximately 60  @xmath2 and 130  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as magnetic field is applied the reflectance is altered dramatically , with the largest changes induced around the plasma minimum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also detect relatively large changes in the very far - infrared part of the spectrum , around 60  @xmath2 phonon mode .    </S>",
    "<S> , b)/r(@xmath5 , 0 t ) for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in fields up to 18 t. very strong field induced changes are detected around the plasma minimum , as well as around the 60  @xmath2 phonon mode . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the absolute values of reflectance in magnetic field r(@xmath5 , b ) , obtained from the ratios shown in panel ( a ) and the absolute values of reflectance in zero field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gray lines are the best fits obtained from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : dlmag ] and [ eq : fano].,width=359 ]    [ fig : ratios ]    kramers - kronig transformation is not directly applicable to magneto - optical spectra @xcite , so instead we apply the fitting procedures , and from the best fits we generate the optical functions of interest . the most frequently used model is the drude - lorentz model , supplemented with the cyclotron resonance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric function tensor @xmath7 is usually represented as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the high - frequency dielectric constant , @xmath10 is the central frequency of the mode , @xmath11 its oscillator strength and @xmath12 its width . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is the cyclotron frequency , which is usually taken as positive for electrons , and negative for holes . </S>",
    "<S> since charge carriers in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 have been known to be electrons @xcite , the cyclotron frequency will be taken as positive , and the cyclotron resonance will show up at positive frequencies in @xmath14 .    to achieve satisfactory fits and to capture the most important features of the data a minimal model consisting of three modes is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> these three modes are : 1 ) a drude mode , which in magnetic field shifts to finite frequencies and becomes a cyclotron resonance , 2 ) a phonon mode at 60  @xmath2 , which has been known to be asymmetric @xcite , and 3 ) a phonon mode at 130  @xmath2 which does not have significant asymmetry and is modeled as a lorentzian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclotron mode was modeled with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : dlmag ] , assuming @xmath10=0 for all fields . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric 60  @xmath2 phonon was modeled as a fano mode @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the central frequency , oscillator strength and width of the fano mode , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is the fano frequency , related to the usual fano asymmetry parameter q as q=@xmath20 . as discussed </S>",
    "<S> previously @xcite , large values of @xmath21 ( i.e. small values of @xmath19 ) indicate little or no asymmetry , whereas small values of @xmath21 ( both positive and negative ) indicate large degree of asymmetry . the form of the fano dielectric function given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : fano ] was introduced specifically for infrared spectra @xcite and has several advantages over the conventional form @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the special case of no asymmetry ( i.e. a lorentzian lineshape ) is achieved for @xmath19=0 , instead of @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the fits at several selected fields are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratios](b ) with gray lines . as can be seen from the plot , </S>",
    "<S> the model is capable of capturing all the essential features of the data at all fields . </S>",
    "<S> this is significant , as the changes of reflectance induced by magnetic field are very large and dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> namely , as the field increases , the plasma edge is gradually altered and a characteristic `` second plasma edge '' develops around 220  @xmath2 , similar to what was observed in bi @xcite and bi@xmath23sb@xmath24 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at the lowest frequencies the reflectance is suppressed as the cyclotron resonance enters the measured frequency window . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the quality of the fits is similar at different magnetic fields , as exemplified through @xmath25 measures , which are all within 10  @xmath6 @xcite .    from the best fits of reflectance obtained with eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : dlmag ] and [ eq : fano ] we can now generate other optical functions of interests , in particular the circular conductivities @xmath26 . as an example in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sigma ] we displays the real part of circular conductivity @xmath27 at 18 t. also shown are the individual components of the fits : the cyclotron resonance , the asymmetric 60  @xmath2 phonon mode and the 130  @xmath2 phonon .     </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : dlmag ] and [ eq : fano ] ) at 18 t is shown with blue line . </S>",
    "<S> also shown are the individual components of the fits : the cyclotron resonance ( red ) , the asymmetric 60  @xmath2 phonon mode ( green ) and the 130  @xmath2 phonon ( magenta ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the cyclotron resonance is several times broader that the phonons.,width=359 ]    [ fig : sigma ]    overall , the optical conductivity @xmath28 is dominated by the phonon mode at 60  @xmath2 . in zero field there is also a drude - like mode , but as the magnetic field increases this mode is gradually suppressed @xcite and shifts to finite frequencies to become a cyclotron resonance . for fields below approximately 5 t , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance is outside of our measured frequency window ( @xmath29  40  @xmath2 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratios ] ) , and only its tail is visible . as field increases , the mode gradually shifts to higher frequencies , its center frequency progressing as a linear function of the field ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : parameters](a ) below ) , eventually reaching 110  @xmath2 ( 13.6 mev ) in 18 t. we point out that the cyclotron resonance is degenerate with the 60  @xmath2 phonon mode for magnetic field of approximately 1011 t.     and [ eq : fano ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) cyclotron resonance frequency @xmath13 is shown with full squares , along with the linear fit ( dashed line ) . </S>",

    "<S> the horizontal dotted line represents the frequency of the phonon . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) fano frequency @xmath19 , related to the fano asymmetry parameter q as q=@xmath16/@xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath19 changes sign at approximately 10 tesla ( vertical dotted line ) , the same field at which the cyclotron frequency is degenerate with the phonon mode.,width=359 ]    [ fig : parameters ]    the parameters of the best fits from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : dlmag ] and [ eq : fano ] are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters ] . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters](a ) displays the cyclotron resonance frequency @xmath13 ( full squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameters of the fits are not shown because they are field independent , within the error bars of the fits . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the cyclotron frequency @xmath13 displays a characteristic linear field dependence which extrapolates to zero in zero field . </S>",
    "<S> a linear fit ( shown with a dashed line ) yields @xmath30/b = 0.77 mev / t , from which we extract the cyclotron effective mass m@xmath31/m@xmath32  =  0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in excellent agrement with the value ( 0.14 ) extracted from a recent magnet - transmission measurement on a thick film @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a fraction of this data are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters](a ) with open circles . </S>",
    "<S> these values of effective mass are approximately 25  @xmath6 smaller compared to the value reported for a bi@xmath0se@xmath1 thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite used time - domain thz spectroscopy in magnetic fields up to 7 t and obtained the effective mass m@xmath31/m@xmath32  =  0.20 . </S>",
    "<S> their data are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters](a ) with open squares . </S>",
    "<S> these recently reported values are in general agreement with earlier reports from optical and quantum oscillations measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> overall the agreement between these three data sets is significant , considering that they were obtained using different experimental techniques . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our measurements were done on a bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , whereas the other two were performed on films ( of very different thicknesses ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate carrier mobility in our sample @xmath33=@xmath13/(b @xmath12)= 1800 @xmath34/vs , which is almost a factor of 2 smaller compared with the value obtained on the thin film @xcite . however , our value is comparable with the values obtained from hall measurements @xcite on bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 samples with similar carrier density @xcite , and almost a factor of 2 greater compared with the thick film @xcite .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters](b ) shows the fano frequency @xmath19 of the 60  @xmath2 phonon mode and represents the most important finding of the paper . </S>",
    "<S> we choose to display @xmath19 instead of q , because for fields around 10 tesla , q acquires large values ( theoretically it diverges ) , which renders the fitting unstable . </S>",
    "<S> as the plot indicates , @xmath19 starts as negative @xcite for zero and small fields , but around 10 tesla changes sign and becomes positive . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is referred to as the q - reversal . as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters ] the asymmetry parameter changes sign when the cyclotron resonance is degenerate with the phonon ( phonon frequency is shown with a horizontal dotted line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : parameters](a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> theory of the asymmetric shape of spectral lines was developed by fano @xcite , and subsequently used in a number of different branches of physics . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the so - called fano resonance have been found in studies of electron - phonon coupling in superconductors @xcite , scattering in photonic crystals and plasmonic nanostructures @xcite , atomic photoemission spectra @xcite , and many other branches of physics and chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> more recently asymmetric fano lines have been found in the infrared spectra of topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite , a few layer graphene @xcite and absorption lines of autoionizing helium @xcite , to name a few .    </S>",
    "<S> the degree of lineshape asymmetry is quantified through the fano parameter q ( or alternatively @xmath19 ) . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> it was observed that , as a results of some external stimulus , the fano parameter changes sign . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is called q - reversal and has been observed for example in atomic physics @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , photonics @xcite and quantum waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , fano q - reversals could not be observed in the previous magneto - optical studies of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite due to the limited values of magnetic field ( b  @xmath35  8  t ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of reversal in this study was enabled by large magnetic fields available at the national high magnetic field laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can trace the origin of reversal to the field dependence of the cyclotron resonance ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : parameters ] ) .    in summary , our magneto - optical results on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in magnetic fields up to 18 t </S>",
    "<S> reveal that electron - phonon coupling is significant and is causing asymmetric ( fano - like ) shape of the 60  @xmath2 phonon . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry parameter ( q ) of the phonon is a function of magnetic field , and around 10 t changes sign , exactly at the field at which the cyclotron resonance is degenerate with the phonon . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first example of fano q - reversal induced by externally applied magnetic field .    </S>",
