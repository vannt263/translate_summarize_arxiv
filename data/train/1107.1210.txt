    "in particular , the invariant for knotted 4-valent graphs is defined in terms of the kauffman polynomial . in  @xcite",
    ", it was also shown that the resulting polynomial @xmath16 of a knotted 4-valent graph @xmath17 satisfies certain graphical relations , which determine values for each planar unoriented 4-valent graph by recursive formulas defined entirely in the category of planar graphs .",
    "kauffman s and vogel s results imply that there is a model for the kauffman polynomial of an unoriented link via planar 4-valent graphs ( these graphs have ordinary vertices ; there is no reason to consider rigid vertices when working with planar graphs ) .",
    "this model can be also deduced from carpentier s work  @xcite on the kauffman and vogel s polynomial by changing one s perspective , as the focus of that paper is not on the kauffman polynomial invariant of links but on invariants of graphs .",
    "thus we believe it is worthwhile presenting this model explicitly .",
    "we give in section  [ sec : comments ] a brief description of how this state model for the kauffman polynomial can be obtained , but throughout the rest of the paper we work with trivalent graphs .",
    "the main reason for this is that trivalent graphs are generic graphs , in the sense that any graph , in particular a 4-valent graph , can be perturbed into a trivalent graph . in this paper ,",
    "a trivalent graph may contain a circle component .",
    "we regard a circle as a graph without vertices .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "one goal is to use trivalent graphs to construct a rational function @xmath18 $ ] which is an invariant of regular isotopy for unoriented links , and we do this using two equivalent constructions .",
    "the first construction is via a state summation and a recurrence method to evaluate planar trivalent graphs - via skein theory .",
    "the inspiration for this construction came from the well - known model for the homflypt polynomial via trivalent graphs constructed by murakami , ohtsuki and yamada  @xcite ( and , as already mentioned , the results of  @xcite ) .",
    "the second method makes use of a representation of the braid group @xmath19 into some algebra @xmath20 whose trace function recovers the invariant @xmath21 .",
    "this algebra is given by generators and relations ; the relations come from the skein theory used in our first definition .",
    "we remark that the algebra @xmath20 is isomorphic to the birman - murakami - wenzl algebra introduced in  @xcite .",
    "our construction and results easily imply that @xmath22 .",
    "although the first method may be implicitly obtained from carpentier s work  @xcite by replacing 4-valent vertices with trivalent vertices , and by shifting the approach to the problem , it might be beneficial for less experienced researchers to give all of the details here . on the other hand ,",
    "the second method giving rise to the kauffman polynomial of a link is completely new .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to construct a three - variable rational function @xmath23 $ ] ( or equivalently , a four - variable laurent polynomial ) which is an invariant for a certain type of knotted unoriented trivalent graphs @xmath17 , and we do this without relying on the existence of the kauffman polynomial for links . instead of extending the kauffman polynomial to trivalent graphs embedded in @xmath0",
    ", we give sufficient conditions that the graph polynomial @xmath23 $ ] must satisfy in order to be an invariant of regular isotopy of knotted graphs .",
    "these conditions imply that the restriction of @xmath23 $ ] to links gives the laurent polynomial @xmath21 ( thus a version of the kauffman polynomial ) .",
    "we also take a look at the one - variable specialization of the kauffman polynomial , the @xmath24 kauffman polynomial , where we focus on the case @xmath25 .",
    "we show that in this particular case , the evaluation @xmath23 $ ] of a planar trivalent graph diagram depends only on the number of its connected components and the number of vertices .",
    "this implies that the polynomial @xmath26 , as well as the corresponding polynomial @xmath23 $ ] of knotted trivalent graphs , are easily computed in this case .",
    "the trivalent graphs under consideration in this paper have two types of edges , namely  standard \" edges and  wide \" edges , such that there is exactly one wide edge incident to a vertex : . unless otherwise stated , all trivalent graphs in this paper are of this type .",
    "when a trivalent graph is knotted , its wide edges are regarded as being rigid , in the sense that there is a cyclic ordering of the four standard edges `` attached '' to a wide edge , given by the rigidity of the wide edge . moreover ,",
    "a wide edge is not allowed to cross itself .",
    "such a knotted graph will be called _ knotted rigid - edge trivalent graph _ ( or shortly knotted re 3-graph ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we give the definition of the polynomial @xmath21 using a state sum formula and skein relations for trivalent graphs , and prove its invariance under the reidemeister ii and iii moves , as well as its behavior under the reidemeister i move . in subsection",
    "[ ssec : algebra ] we define the algebra @xmath20 , while in subsection  [ ssec : representation ] we construct a representation of the braid group on @xmath27 strands , @xmath19 , into @xmath20 . there is a trace function defined on the algebra @xmath20 , and we employ it in subsection  [ ssec : bracket - braids ] to define a _ bracket _",
    "polynomial of a braid and to recover the link invariant @xmath21 .",
    "section  [ sec : knotted graphs ] is dedicated to knotted re 3-graphs , and especially to the graph polynomial @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "we give the model for the @xmath24 kauffman polynomial in subsection  [ ssec : one - variable poly ] , and we treat the case @xmath28 for the corresponding polynomial for planar trivalent graph diagrams in subsection  [ ssec : n=2 ] . a few concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : comments ] .",
    "( finally , an appendix is used to keep some technicalities out of the way . )",
    "let @xmath29 be a plane diagram of an unoriented link @xmath1 in @xmath0 .",
    "associate to each crossing of @xmath29 a formal linear combination of planar trivalent graphs as shown in figure  [ fig : replacing crossings ] ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are commuting variables ) .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the main reason is that trivalent graphs are generic graphs .",
    "another reason involves the second outcome of this paper , namely the polynomial invariant for knotted re 3-graphs and well - known results that enable one to study knotted handlebodies through knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "a _ handlebody - knot _ is a handlebody embedded in the 3-sphere @xmath216 .",
    "any handlebody - knot is a regular neighborhood of some knotted trivalent graph .",
    "hence there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of knotted handlebodies and that of neighborhood equivalence classes of knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "two knotted graphs are neighborhood equivalent if there is an isotopy of @xmath216 taking a regular neighborhood of one graph onto that of the other ( we refer the reader to suzuki  @xcite for details about this notion ) .",
    "ishii  @xcite proved that two knotted trivalent graphs are neighborhood equivalent if and only if they are related by a finite sequence of ih - moves and isotopies of @xmath0 , where an _ ih - move _ is a local change of a knotted trivalent graph as described in figure  [ fig : ih - move ] . in particular , if @xmath217 and @xmath218 are knotted trivalent graphs with diagrams @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then @xmath217 and @xmath218 are neighborhood equivalent if and only if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are related by a finite sequence of classical reidemeister moves ( for knots ) combined with the moves depicted in  ( [ graph moves ] ) ( together with their mirror images ) , and the ih - move .",
    "this implies that if @xmath219 is an invariant for knotted trivalent graphs which is also invariant under the ih - move , then @xmath219 is an invariant for handlebody - knots .",
    "therefore , it is good that the graph polynomial @xmath38 satisfies the relation @xmath221{resol}}\\,\\right ) = p \\left(\\ , \\raisebox{-3pt}{\\includegraphics[height=0.2 in , angle = 90]{resol}}\\,\\right)$ ] .",
    "the polynomial @xmath222 $ ] is an invariant of knotted re 3-graphs , thus it falls slightly short of being an invariant for arbitrary knotted trivalent graphs , and consequently , of handlebody - knots .",
    "can the construction presented in this paper be slightly modified so that it produces a honest invariant of topological knotted trivalent graphs ? maybe somebody reading this paper will find a solution to this question .",
    "the definition of the @xmath24 kauffman polynomial via the state model and trivalent graphs given in subsection  [ ssec : one - variable poly ] might prove useful in constructing a categorification of this polynomial .",
    "more specifically , given an unoriented link one may wish to construct a chain complex of graded vector spaces whose graded euler characteristic is the @xmath24 kauffman polynomial of the link .",
    "there is a relationship between the two - variable kauffman polynomial and the homflypt polynomial , due to francois jaeger .",
    "he obtains a homflypt polynomial expansion of the kauffman polynomial of an unoriented link @xmath1 , by writing the kauffman polynomial of @xmath1 as a certain weighted sum of homflypt polynomials of oriented links associated with the given link @xmath1 .",
    "jaeger s model is described in  @xcite ( part i , section 14 ) . applying the murakami - ohtsuki - yamada  @xcite framework for the homflypt polynomial to jaeger s model ,",
    "one obtains a model for the kauffman polynomial via trivalent graphs ( we thank lorenzo traldi for pointing this out to us ) .",
    "then the following natural question arises : how is this model related to the one presented here in section  [ sec : model ] ?      we shall prove theorem  [ thm : unique poly ] , that is , we will show that for every planar trivalent graph diagram @xmath31 , the graph skein relations  ( [ gi2 ] ) - ( [ gi6 ] ) determine a unique , well - defined laurent polynomial @xmath223 $ ] .",
