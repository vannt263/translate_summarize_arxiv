    "@xcite we recently performed also a preliminary study of the residence time ( rt ) of the water molecules .",
    "we found that the rt is strongly dependent on the distance from the substrate and its distribution shows an anomalous non - brownian behaviour when the contribution of the molecules close to the substrate alone is considered .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show the connection between the anomalous behaviour of the rt and the long time limit of the mean square displacement ( msd ) in the low hydration regime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the system , give details of the computer simulation and discuss some structural properties of confined water  @xcite useful for the characterization of the rt behaviour . in the third section by considering the residence time distribution and the molecular diffusion",

    "the layering effect shown in the bottom panels is due to the formation of the vycor - water hb .",

    "are reported the calculations of the mean square displacement ( msd ) at @xmath6 for decreasing temperatures .",
    "it is clear that after the ballistic regime at short time , at around @xmath18  ps there is the onset of a cage effect characterized by the presence of a plateau which increases by lowering the temperature . the plateau is determined by the transient caging of the nearest neighbours . at longer times",
    "the msd does not appear to reach the usual brownian diffusion since the behaviour is sub - linear .",
    "analogous results are found for the other hydration levels investigated . at this point",
    "further analysis is needed in order to clarify whether this subdiffusive behaviour is just a transient leading to normal brownian diffusion for longer times , although unreachable with normal computers , or it can be framed in the context of anomalous subdiffusive phenomena .",
    "anomalous diffusion is generally speaking defined trough the time dependence of the msd , the second moment of the spatial coordinates of the diffusive particles , which generally has a long time dependence of the form @xmath19 anomalous diffusion corresponds to @xmath20 . in particular @xmath21",
    "is termed superdiffusion and @xmath22 subdiffusion . from a theoretical point of view the origin of anomalous diffusion can be traced back to the analytic form of the distribution of the waiting times @xmath23 . under the assumption",
    "that the amplitude of the random jumps is constant and finite anomalous diffusion has been shown to be generated by an inverse power law distribution for large times  @xcite @xmath24 in the case of ordinary brownian motion the long time limit of the distribution would decay with an exponential law .    in our case the sublinear diffusion observed can be connected to the processes which take place close to the substrate and to the interaction of the water molecules with the disordered surface  @xcite . in this respect since oscillations of the rt appear so closely connected to the double layer structure it is of interest to look at the residence time distribution of the water molecules close to the substrate .",
