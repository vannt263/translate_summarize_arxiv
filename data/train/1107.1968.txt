    "the generalized cancellation problem asks if two algebraic varieties @xmath1 and @xmath2 with isomorphic cylinders @xmath3 and @xmath4 are isomorphic themselves .",
    "although the answer turns out to be affirmative for a large class of varieties including the case when one of the varieties is the affine plane @xmath5 @xcite , counter - examples exists for affine varieties in any dimension@xmath6 , and the particular case when one of the two varieties is an affine space @xmath7 , @xmath8 , still remains a widely open problem .",
    "the first counter - example for complex affine varieties has been constructed by danielewski @xcite in 1989 : he exploited the fact that the non isomorphic affine surfaces @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 can be equipped with free actions of the additive group @xmath12 admitting geometric quotients in the form of non trivial @xmath12-bundles @xmath13 , @xmath14 over the affine line with a double origin .",
    "it then follows that the fiber product @xmath15 inherits simultaneously the structure of a @xmath12-bundle over @xmath16 and @xmath17 via the first and the second projection respectively , but since @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both affine , the latter are both trivial , providing isomorphisms @xmath18 . since then , danielewski s fiber product trick has been the source of many new counter - examples in any dimension @xcite , some of these being very close to affine spaces either from an algebraic or a topological point of view .",
    "however , a counter - example over the field of real numbers was constructed earlier by hochster @xcite using the algebraic counterpart of the classical fact from differential geometry that the tangent bundle of the real sphere @xmath19 is non trivial but @xmath20-stably trivial .",
    "his argument actually applies more generally to the situation when a finitely generated domain @xmath21 over a field @xmath22 admits a non trivial projective module @xmath23 of rank @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , these hypotheses immediately imply that the varieties @xmath26 and @xmath27)$ ] are not isomorphic as schemes over @xmath28 while their cylinders are . of course , there is no reason in general that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not isomorphic as @xmath22-varieties , but this holds for instance when @xmath29 does not admit any dominant morphism from an affine space @xmath30 since then any isomorphism between @xmath1 and @xmath2 necessarily descends to an automorphism of @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , jelonek @xcite gave revival to hochster idea by constructing families of examples of non uniruled affine open subsets of affine spaces of any dimension @xmath31 with @xmath20-stably trivial but non trivial vector bundles , which fail the cancellation property .",
    "while affine affine open subsets of affine spaces of dimension @xmath32 always have the cancellation property ( see e.g. _",
    "loc.cit_ ) , we derive in this note from a variant of danielewski s fiber product trick that cancellation already fails for suitably chosen principal open subsets of @xmath0 .    as an application of our construction",
    "we also obtain that all cylinders over koras - russell threefolds @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 relatively prime @xcite , have a trivial makar - limanov invariant @xcite .",

    "a surface @xmath46 having no non constant invertible function , an isomorphism @xmath47 necessarily maps closed fibers of @xmath48 isomorphically onto that of @xmath49 .",
    "but since @xmath46 is isomorphic to @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 and proposition 3.6 ) ) , it follows that the threefolds @xmath42 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , are pairwise non isomorphic .",
    "in contrast , we have the following result :      we exploit the fact that every @xmath42 admits a free @xmath12-action defined by the locally nilpotent derivation @xmath53 of its coordinate ring @xmath54_{f_{d , l}}$ ] . a free @xmath12-action being locally trivial in the tale topology",
    ", it follows that a geometric quotient @xmath55 exists in the form of an tale locally trivial @xmath12-bundle over a certain algebraic space @xmath56 .",
    "then it is enough to show that for every fixed @xmath37 , the algebraic spaces @xmath56 are all isomorphic , say to a fixed algebraic space @xmath57 . indeed ,",
    "if so , then for every @xmath58 , the fiber product @xmath59 will be simultaneously a @xmath12-bundle over @xmath42 and @xmath60 via the first and second projection respectively whence will be simultaneously isomorphic to the trivial @xmath12-bundles @xmath52 and @xmath61 as @xmath42 and @xmath60 are both affine",

    "* lemma 1.2 ) implies that for every @xmath79 , the @xmath12-invariant morphism @xmath80 restricts on @xmath81 to a trivial @xmath12-bundle over @xmath82 .",
    "letting @xmath83 be the scheme over @xmath84\\right)$ ] obtained by gluing @xmath68 copies @xmath85 , @xmath79 , of @xmath84\\right)$ ] outside their respective origins , it follows that @xmath86 factors through a @xmath67-equivariant @xmath12-bundle @xmath87 , where @xmath67 acts freely on @xmath88 by @xmath89 .",
    "a quotient @xmath90 exist in the category of algebraic spaces in the form of a principal @xmath67-bundle @xmath91 , and the above description implies that @xmath92 descends to an tale locally trivial @xmath12-bundle @xmath93 for which the diagram @xmath94_-{\\rho_{d , l}\\times { \\rm i d } } \\ar[r]^-{\\pi_{d , l } } & u_{d , l}\\simeq ( s_{d , l}\\times \\mathbb{a}^1_*)/\\mu_l \\ar[d]^{\\tilde{\\nu}_{d , l } } \\\\ c(l)\\times \\mathbb{a}^1 _ * \\ar[r]^{\\sigma_l } & \\mathfrak{s}_l,}\\ ] ] is cartesian . by virtue of the universal property of categorical quotients",
    "one has necessarily @xmath95 for every @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , the isomorphy type of @xmath56 depends only on @xmath68 , which completes the proof .",
    "the algebraic spaces @xmath96 , @xmath37 , considered in the proof above can not be schemes : indeed , otherwise the image in @xmath57 of the point @xmath97 would have a zariski open affine neighborhood @xmath98 .",
    "but then the inverse image of @xmath98 by the finite tale cover @xmath99 would be a @xmath67-invariant affine open neighborhood of @xmath100 in @xmath88 , which is absurd since @xmath100 does not even have a separated @xmath67-invariant open neighborhood in @xmath88 .",
    "this implies in turn that the free @xmath12-action on @xmath42 defined by the locally nilpotent derivation @xmath53 is not locally trivial in the zariski topology .",
    "in contrast , the latter property holds for its lift to @xmath69 via the tale galois cover @xmath101 .    in danielewski s construction for the surfaces @xmath102 , @xmath14 , the geometric quotients @xmath103 , @xmath14 , were obtained from the categorical quotients @xmath104)$ ] taken in the category of affine schemes by replacing the origin by two copies of itself , one for each orbit in the zero fiber of the quotient morphism @xmath105 . for the threefolds @xmath42 ,",
    "the difference between the quotients @xmath106_{f_{d , l}}^{\\mathbb{g}_{a}})$ ] taken in the category of ( affine ) schemes and the geometric quotients @xmath107 is very similar : indeed , we may identify @xmath42 with the closed subvariety of @xmath108[t^{\\pm1}])$ ] defined by the equation @xmath109 in such a way that @xmath62 coincides with the projection @xmath110 .",
    "then , the kernel of the locally nilpotent derivation @xmath53 of the coordinate ring of @xmath42 coincides with the subalgebra @xmath111 $ ] and so , the @xmath12-invariant morphism @xmath112[t^{\\pm1}])$ ] is a categorical quotient in the category of affine schemes .",
    "one checks easily that @xmath113 restricts to a trivial @xmath12-bundle over the principal open subset @xmath114 of @xmath82 whereas the inverse image of the punctured line @xmath115 is isomorphic to @xmath116/(y^{l}-t)[z])$ ] where @xmath12 acts by translations on the second factor .",
    "so we may interpret the geometric quotient @xmath107 as being obtained from @xmath117 by replacing the punctured line @xmath115 not by @xmath68 disjoint copies of itself but , instead , by the total space @xmath118 of the nontrivial tale galois cover @xmath119 .",
    "the koras - russell threefolds @xmath120 are smooth complex affine varieties defined by equations of the form @xmath121 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are relatively prime .",
    "while all diffeomorphic to the euclidean space @xmath122 , none of these threefold is algebraically isomorphic to the affine @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it was established by kaliman and makar - limanov @xcite that they have fewer algebraic @xmath12-actions than the affine space @xmath0 : the subring @xmath123 of their coordinate ring consisting of regular functions invariant under all algebraic @xmath12-actions on @xmath120 is equal to the polynomial ring @xmath124 $ ] , while @xmath125 is _ trivial _ , consisting of constants only .",
    "however , it was observed by the author in @xcite that the makar - limanov invariant @xmath126 fails to distinguish the cylinder over the so - called russell cubic @xmath127 from the affine space @xmath128 .",
    "this phenomenon holds more generally for cylinders over all koras - russell threefolds @xmath120 :      we consider @xmath129 as the subvariety of @xmath130\\left[v\\right]\\right)$ ] defined by the equation @xmath131 . since @xmath132 $ ]",

    "to multiplying it by a suitable power of @xmath140 , we may further assume that @xmath138 is the extension to @xmath54_{f_{d , l}}\\left[v\\right]$ ] of a locally nilpotent derivation of @xmath54\\left[v\\right]$ ] which has @xmath48 but not @xmath133 in its kernel .",
