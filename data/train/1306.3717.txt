    "due to the open nature of wireless channel , information transmission security is always a critical issue in wireless communications . traditionally , secure communication is realized by using cryptography technology . with the development of interception technology ,",
    "cryptography technology becomes more and more complex , resulting in high computation .",
    "in fact , it has been proven by information theory that wireless security can be guaranteed by physical layer technology , namely physical layer security @xcite @xcite .",
    "the advantage of physical layer security lies in that it is independent of the interception ability of the eavesdropper , so it is appealing in secure communications with low - complexity nodes .",
    "the performance of physical layer security depends on the difference between the legitimate channel capacity and the eavesdropper channel capacity , namely secrecy rate @xcite .",
    "intuitively , multi - antenna techniques can improve the legitimate channel capacity and degrade the performance of the eavesdropper channel simultaneously by exploiting the spatial degree of freedom .",
    "thus , physical layer security based on multi - antenna system draws considerably attentions @xcite @xcite . in @xcite , the problem regarding the maximum secrecy rate in multiple - antenna system",
    "was addressed by designing an optimal transmit beam , assuming that full csi related to the legitimate and eavesdropper channels is available at the transmitter . however , in practical systems , the eavesdropper is usually passive and hidden , so the transmitter is difficult to obtain the eavesdropper csi .",
    "under such a condition , it seems impossible to provide a steady secrecy rate , and thus the ergodic secrecy rate is adopted as a useful and intuitive metric to evaluate security . in @xcite , the ergodic secrecy rate for gaussian miso wiretap channels was analyzed and the corresponding optimal transmit beam was presented .",
    "the work shown in @xcite considered the scenario where all nodes have multiple antennas , and the ergodic rate for such an mimo secrecy scenario has been developed .",
    "another advantage of the multi - antenna secrecy system lies in that it supports concurrent transmission of multiple legitimate users . on one hand",
    ", multiuser transmission can improve the ergodic secrecy sum - rate .",
    "on the other hand , the inter - user interference can weaken the interception effect . in @xcite , the ergodic secrecy sum - rate for orthogonal random beamforming with opportunistic scheduling",
    "was presented .",
    "yet , in multiuser downlink networks , orthogonal random beamforming may suffer performance loss if the number of users is not so large . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proposed to convey the quantized csi from the legitimate user to the transmitter for transmit beam design in a single receiver secure scenario .",
    "combining the advantages of multiuser transmission and csi conveyance , this letter proposes to perform limited feedback zero - forcing ( zfbf ) at the transmitter in multiuser multi - antenna downlink networks @xcite .",
    "we focus on the quantitative analysis of the ergodic secrecy sum - rate , and derive its closed - form expression in terms of the feedback amount .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic characteristics of the ergodic secrecy sum - rate is analyzed , so as to provide an explicit insight on system parameter optimization for physical layer security in multiuser multi - antenna downlink networks .",
    "the rest of this letter is organized as follows .",
    "we first provide an overview of the multiuser secure system model in section ii , and then the ergodic secrecy sum - rate is derived in section iii .",
    "we investigate the asymptotic characteristics of the ergodic secrecy sum - rate in section iv .",
    "some numerical results are given to show the accuracy of the theoretical analysis in section v. finally , the whole letter is concluded in section vi .",
    "we consider a homogeneous multiuser multi - antenna downlink network employing physical layer security for secure communication , where a base station ( bs ) equipped with @xmath0 antennas communicates with @xmath1 single antenna legitimate users ( lu ) , while a passive single antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept the transmission information , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in this letter",
    ", we only consider the case of @xmath2 , since the multi - antenna system can admit @xmath3 users at most for each time slot .",
    "note that if @xmath4 , user scheduling can be adopted to select @xmath3 users .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote the @xmath3 dimensional legitimate channel vector from the bs to the @xmath6th lu with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean and unit variance complex gaussian entries .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath7 to denote the @xmath3 dimensional eavesdropper channel vector from the bs to the eavesdropper , where @xmath8 is the relative path loss defined as the ratio of path loss of the eavesdropper channel and that of the legitimate channel , and @xmath9 is the channel fast fading distributed as @xmath10 .",
    "the whole network is operated in slotted time . at the beginning of each time slot , the lu first estimates the csi related to its legitimate channel , and then chooses an optimal codeword to quantize the csi from a predetermined quantization codebook @xmath11 of size @xmath12 according to the following selection criterion by assuming perfect csi at the lu : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the channel direction vector .",
    "next , the index of the optimal codeword is conveyed by the @xmath6th lu and @xmath15 is recovered at the bs from the same codebook as the instantaneous csi of the @xmath6th legitimate channel .",
    "based on the @xmath3 lus feedback information , the bs determines the optimal transmit beam @xmath16 for the @xmath6th lu by making use of zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) design method .",
    "specifically , given @xmath15 , we first construct its complementary matrix @xmath17\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking singular value decomposition ( svd ) to @xmath18 , if @xmath19 is the matrix composed of the right singular vectors with zero singular values , then we randomly choose a unit norm vector from the space spanned by @xmath19 as the transmit beam @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath19 is the null space of @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 thus , the receive signals at the @xmath6th lu and the eavesdropper can be expressed as @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , where @xmath24 is the normalized gaussian distributed transmit signal for the @xmath6th lu , @xmath25 is the transmit power , @xmath26 is the additive gaussian white noise with variance @xmath27 . in this context",
    ", the ergodic secrecy sum - rate can be expressed as @xmath28\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{n_t}e\\left[\\log_2\\left(1+\\gamma_k\\right)\\right]-\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{n_t}e\\left[\\log_2\\left(1+\\zeta_k\\right)\\right]\\label{eqn5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the sinr related to the @xmath6th lu s signal at the @xmath31th lu and the eavesdropper .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) follows the fact that the legitimate and eavesdropper channels are independent of each other .",
    "the focus of this letter is on the quantitative analysis of the ergodic secrecy sum - rate in terms of feedback amount @xmath32 and bs antenna number ( lu number ) @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , we intend to derive the ergodic secrecy sum - rate @xmath33 in a multiuser multi - antenna downlink network in presence of a passive eavesdropper . as seen in ( [ eqn5 ] ) , the key of computing the ergodic secrecy sum - rate is to obtain the distributions of the sinrs @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in what follows ,",
    "we first give an investigation of their distributions employing limited feedback zfbf . according to the theory of random vector quantization ( rvq ) @xcite ,",
    "the relationship between the original and the quantized channel direction vectors is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnitude of the quantization error , and @xmath38 is an unit norm vector isotropically distributed in the nullspace of @xmath15 , and is independent of @xmath39 .    substituting ( [ eqn6 ] ) into the definition of the sinr @xmath34 , we have @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the equality in distribution , and @xmath43 .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) holds true by applying the property of limited feedback zfbf in ( [ eqn2 ] ) . in ( [ eqn8 ] )",
    ", @xmath16 is designed regardless of @xmath5 , so @xmath44 is @xmath45 distributed with the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath46 . according to the theory of quantization cell approximation @xcite , the product of channel gain @xmath47 and the magnitude of quantization error @xmath39 is @xmath48 distributed with the pdf of @xmath49 . additionally , since @xmath38 and @xmath50 are i.i.d . isotropic vectors in the @xmath51 dimensional null space of @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath52 is @xmath53 distributed with pdf of @xmath54 @xcite . in ( [ eqn9 ] ) , the product of a @xmath48 distributed random variable and a @xmath53 distributed random variable is @xmath55 , so the sum of @xmath51 independent @xmath55 distributed random variables is @xmath56 distributed , where the pdf of the @xmath56 distribution is @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath34 is derived as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the conditional cdf of @xmath62 for a given @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath63 , and @xmath65 is the gamma function .",
    "( [ eqn10 ] ) holds true since @xmath66 is the pdf of @xmath67 .",
    "examining the definition of @xmath35 , it can be considered as a special @xmath34 without csi feedback , namely @xmath68 or @xmath69 , so the cdf of @xmath35 can be derived based on ( [ eqn10 ] ) as @xmath70 substituting ( [ eqn10 ] ) and ( [ eqn11 ] ) into ( [ eqn5 ] ) , we have @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the exponential - integral function .",
    "@xmath76 denotes the derivative of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "the first term of ( [ eqn12 ] ) is derived following @xcite and the second term is obtained according to [ eq .",
    "3.3532 , 15 ] thus , we obtain the ergodic secrecy sum - rate as a function of feedback amount @xmath32 , antenna number @xmath3 , channel condition @xmath8 and transmit power @xmath25 , so as to provide an insight on parameter selection in secure communications .",
    "in this section , for the sake of evaluating the performance easily , we analyze the asymptotic characteristics of ergodic secrecy sum - rate in some extreme cases .",
    "if transmit power @xmath25 is quite high or lu number is so large , the receive noise is negligible with respect to the inter - user interference .",
    "thus , the sinrs are reduced as @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . in this case , the cdfs can be expressed as @xmath80 and @xmath81 similar to ( [ eqn12 ] ) , the ergodic secrecy sum - rate can be computed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the beta function and @xmath84 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "( [ eqn15 ] ) is derived according to [ eq .",
    "3.1971 , 15 ] .",
    "it is found that in interference - limited case , the ergodic secrecy sum - rate is independent of transmit power @xmath25 and channel condition @xmath8 . given @xmath3 and @xmath32 , the ergodic secrecy sum - rate is a constant .",
    "if the inter - user interference is negligible due to low transmit power or strong noise , the sinrs can be approximated as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . as analyzed earlier ,",
    "both @xmath44 and @xmath87 are @xmath88 distributed , so the cdfs of the sinrs are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 in this case , the ergodic secrecy sum - rate can be computed as @xmath91 it is found that the ergodic secrecy sum - rate in noise - limited case is independent of feedback amount . in other words , the ergodic secrecy sum - rates with different @xmath32s",
    "asymptotically approach the same value as @xmath25 decreases .",
    "to examine the accuracy of the derived ergodic secrecy sum - rate in multiuser multi - antenna downlink networks , we present several numerical results in the following scenario : we set @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , we define snr@xmath94 as the transmit snr .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] compares the ergodic secrecy sum - rates obtained by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation with different relative path losses @xmath8 .",
    "it is seen that the theoretical result is quite consistent with the simulation result in the whole snr region , which validate the high accuracy of the derived result .",
    "note that relative path loss @xmath8 has a great impact on the ergodic secrecy sum - rate in the low snr region , since the small @xmath8 , indicating the weak intercepting signal at the eavesdropper , leads to a large ergodic secrecy sum - rate . with the increase of snr , the ergodic secrecy sum - rates with different @xmath8s asymptotically approach the same value , which is equivalent to the interference - limited case",
    "whose ergodic secrecy sum - rate is independent of relative path loss and snr , as shown in ( [ eqn15 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is found that the ergodic secrecy sum - rate is not an increasing function of snr , since both the legitimate and eavesdropper channel capacities increase as snr adds .",
    "thus , there is an optimal snr in the sense of maximizing the ergodic secrecy sum - rate , which provides an important insight on system parameter selection , especially in green communications that concentrate on energy efficiency .",
    "this letter focused on the performance analysis for physical layer security in multiuser multi - antenna downlink networks with quantized csi feedback , and derived the closed - form expression of ergodic secrecy sum - rate in terms of feedback amount and channel condition . through asymptotic analysis",
    ", we obtained the relatively simple expression of ergodic secrecy sum - rate in two extreme scenarios .",
