    "magnetic fields may efficiently transport angular momentum in protoplanetary disks either via mhd turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; hawley , gammie & balbus 1994 ) , by accelerating a wind from the disk surfaces ( blandford & payne 1982 ; wardle & knigl 1993 ) , or by looping above the disk surface and linking different radii .",
    "advection and/or stirring by magnetically - driven turbulence affects disk chemistry ( e.g.  semenov , wiebe & henning 2006 ; ilgner & nelson 2006 ) , the aggregation and settling of small particles that are the preliminary stages of planet building ( johansen & klahr 2005 ; turner et al .",
    "2006 ; fromang & papaloizou 2006 ; ciesla 2007 ) , and magnetic activity at the disk surface may produce a corona ( e.g.  fleming & stone 2003 ) and affect observational signatures of protoplanetary disks .",
    "a magnetically - mediated effective viscosity would also determine the response of the disk to the gravitational disturbances of forming planets , modifying the balance between the torques applied by the outer and inner neighbouring regions of the disk and therefore the rate and direction of planetary migration ( matsumura & pudritz 2003 ; johnson , goodman & menou 2006 ; chambers 2006 ) .",
    "finally , magnetic fields are likely to play a role in giant planet formation and the formation and evolution of their satellite systems ( quillen & trilling 1998 ; fendt 2003 ) .",
    "one critical uncertainty is the magnitude and nature of the coupling between magnetic fields and protoplanetary disks , which are very weakly ionised on account of the self - shielding against ionising sources provided by their high column density , and by rapid recombinations because of their high number densities .",
    "in addition the mobility of charged particles is reduced by the relatively high density , and dust grains sweep up charges and render them effectively immobile .",
    "indeed , magnetic fields were expected to be negligible in protoplanetary disks , as extremely high diffusion was thought to eliminate the magnetic gradients responsible for magnetic stresses except at the disk surfaces ( e.g.  hayashi 1981 ) . but these expectations are too pessimistic . at",
    "any given radius in the disk the density declines rapidly with height because of tidal squeezing by the gravitational field of the central star . the corresponding rapid decline in diffusivity towards the disk surface",
    "is aided by external ionisation by cosmic rays and by stellar x - rays which dominate cosmic rays by five orders of magnitude within a few g@xmath4 of the disk surface ( glassgold , najita & igea 1997 ; igea & glassgold 1999 ) , so that at least the surface layers may be magnetically active ( gammie 1996 ; wardle 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the hall effect provides a dissipationless diffusion pathway that can maintain field gradients under a much broader range of conditions than would otherwise occur ( wardle & ng 1999 ; wardle 1999 ; balbus & terquem 2001 ) .",
    "finally , aggregation and settling of grains increases the number and mobility of charged species in the gas phase and reduces diffusivity to the point that magnetic stresses are important even at the disk midplane ( sano & stone 2002 ) .    here",
    "i explore the nature and magnitude of magnetic diffusion in protoplanetary disks through calculations of the ionisation equilibrium in a stratified disk exposed to cosmic rays and to x - rays from the central star .",
    "to estimate the degree of coupling of magnetic fields to the matter in protoplanetary disks we first need a notional model for the physical conditions within the disk .",
    "i adopt the minimum - mass solar nebula model ( weidenschilling 1977 ; hayashi 1981 ) , in which the surface density of the solar nebula , @xmath5 , is estimated by adding sufficient hydrogen and helium to the solid bodies in the solar system to recover standard interstellar abundances and spreading this material smoothly in a disk .",
    "this yields an estimate of the minimum surface density needed in the solar nebula to form the solar system , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial distance @xmath8 from the sun in astronomical units .",
    "the disk mass enclosed within @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath8 is assumed to be much greater than the inner disk radius @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature profile of the disk is estimated by considering the thermal balance for a black body of radius @xmath11 at a distance @xmath8 from the sun , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , which yields @xmath14 these rough estimates of the distribution of matter and temperature are broadly consistent with continuum observations of protoplanetary disks around low mass stars , albeit with resolutions equivalent to @xmath15au scales ( e.g.  kitamura et al .",
    "2002 ; andrews & williams 2005 ) .",
    "the isothermal sound speed in the disk implied by this temperature profile is @xmath16 which is small compared to the local keplerian speed @xmath17 , so the disk is thin ( see eq [ [ eq : h ] ] below ) . here",
    "i have adopted a mean molecular weight of 7/3 @xmath18 appropriate for a mixture of 80% h@xmath19 and 20% he by number .",
    "@xmath20 parameter ( toomre 1964 ) is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the local keplerian frequency and @xmath23 is the gravitational constant , so the disk is not unstable to self gravity ( as expected given @xmath24 ) .",
    "of course this represents the _ minimum _ solar nebula ; the surface density could be increased by factor of @xmath2530 between 1100au before the disk becomes gravitationally unstable ( e.g. durisen et al .",
    "2007 ) , although as noted above large disk masses do not seem to be present in low mass ysos .",
    "assuming that the temperature does not depend on height @xmath26 above the disk midplane , the balance between tidal squeezing by the central object and its internal pressure imply that the gas density is stratified as @xmath27 where the disk scale height @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 the density at the midplane , @xmath30 , is determined by eq ( [ eq : sigma ] ) and the relation @xmath31 , yielding a number density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath32 at the midplane .",
    "it should be emphasised that the temperature certainly depends on height because of the effects of external irradiation , height - dependent dissipation of accretion energy and the effects of chemistry and optical depth on the ability of a gas parcel to cool ( see e.g.  dullemond et al .",
    "nevertheless the decline in pressure with height required by tidal confinement of the disk is provided primarily by the drop in density .",
    "there are as yet , no direct measurements of the field strength in protoplanetary disks , apart from remanent magnetism in meteorites which indicate field strengths in the solar nebula of 0.11 g at 1au ( levy & sonett 1978 ) .",
    "nevertheless the likely range of field strengths is easily estimated . a lower limit is established by the 110 mg magnetic field strengths measured using zeeman splitting of oh 18 cm lines in the cores of molecular clouds and and in masers in star forming regions .",
    "this field is likely to be amplified by compression and shear during the formation of the central star and its surrounding disk .",
    "it therefore seems likely that @xmath33 in protoplanetary disks .",
    "an upper limit on b is provided by equality of magnetic and thermal pressure in the disk midplane , @xmath34 which yields @xmath35 note that the equipartition field @xmath36 scales as @xmath37 if the disk surface density is increased over the minimum solar nebula value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the upper and lower limits are disparate at 1au but are equal at 100au .",
    "it is worth comparing these limits to the field strength that is _ required _ if magnetic fields are responsible for the loss of angular momentum implied by the observationally inferred disk accretion rates @xmath38 ( calvet , hartmann & strom 2000 ) . to do this",
    ", we take as a starting point the mhd momentum equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gas pressure and @xmath41 is the point - mass gravitational potential of the central star . assuming axisymmetry , and adopting cylindrical coordinates , the toroidal component of the momentum equation reduces to @xmath42_\\phi = ( { \\bm{b}}\\cdot{\\nabla}{\\bm{b}})_\\phi\\,/4\\pi$ ] .",
    "it is clear that the options for angular momentum transport under these assumptions are limited ! assuming that @xmath43 is small within the disk we obtain @xmath44 which equates the rate of angular momentum loss by the gas to the magnetic torque .",
    "the magnetic field transports angular momentum radially and vertically via the @xmath45 and @xmath46 terms on the right hand side respectively .",
    "the lhs is related to the accretion rate at @xmath8 , @xmath47 by integrating between the lower and upper disk surfaces at @xmath48 . before integrating eq ( [ eq : angmom2 ] ) in this manner , note that @xmath49 where @xmath50 and use @xmath51 to obtain @xmath52 then integrating vertically between the disc surfaces yields @xmath53 where i have defined @xmath54 and @xmath55 or @xmath56 at the upper or lower disc surfaces respectively .",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the same order of magnitude , and the magnetic flux exiting the disk surfaces is anchored in an external envelope or outflow , then @xmath59 at the disk surface is non - negligible and the first term in ( [ eq : brbphi ] ) is smaller than the second by a factor @xmath60 . in this case",
    "the torque per unit area applied to the disk by the net magnetic tension across it equals the rate of angular momentum loss by the material in the disk , and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is @xmath63 in units of @xmath64 .",
    "this estimate is a robust lower limit on the rms field in the disk , as it assumes efficient vertical transport of angular momentum by an ordered magnetic field .",
    "if radial transport dominates instead , then @xmath65 must be larger than the estimate ( [ eq : brms ] ) by a factor @xmath66 .",
    "if the field is disordered because of turbulence , then these represent a space _ and _ time - averaged rms magnetic field ( see , e.g.  balbus 2003 ) , and the local field may be somewhat larger . for example , simulations of the magnetorotational instability  indicate that @xmath67 ( sano et al .",

    ", one concludes that gauss - strength fields at 1au are required to give the inferred accretion rates .",
    "magnetic diffusion is an essential ingredient in any theory of magnetised astrophysical disks .",
    "for example , field diffusion allows matter to be accreted while leaving the magnetic field behind . in disk - driven wind models magnetic",
    "diffusion allows some of the disk material to be loaded onto field lines and flung outwards from the disk surfaces ( wardle & knigl 1993 ) while the remainder is accreted .",
    "diffusion is also associated with energy dissipation and sets the inner scale of magnetic structures .",
    "the magnitude of the diffusivity is determined by microphysical processes rather than the wishes of a theorist ( or an observer for that matter ! ) . in fully - ionised disks",
    "the molecular diffusivity is orders of magnitude too small and an effective turbulent viscosity or anomalous diffusivity of plasma physics origin has to be invoked as the origin of the breakdown of ideal mhd . in the weakly - ionised environment of protoplanetary disks collisions between charged particles and the dominant neutrals",
    "are sufficient to provide the necessary diffusivity , and may be too efficient , suppressing magnetic activity , leading to the formation of `` dead '' zones in the disk ( gammie 1996 ; wardle 1997 ) . if simple neutral - charged particle collisions are the origin of diffusivity then _ quantitative _ calculations can provide a sound physical basis for calculations of magnetic field evolution in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the finite conductivity of a weakly - ionised gas can be determined by calculating the drift of charged particles in response to an applied electric field @xmath68 in the neutral frame , and summing over the charged species to obtain the current ( cowling 1976 ) .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath69 of each charged species @xmath70 ( mass @xmath71 , charge @xmath72 ) relative to the neutrals ( mean mass @xmath73 , density @xmath74 ) is determined by balancing the force applied by the electric field , the magnetic force , and the drag associated with neutral collisions : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the rate coefficient for collisional momentum transfer between species @xmath70 and the neutrals , so @xmath78 is the collision frequency with neutrals .",
    "eq ( [ eq : vj ] ) implicitly assumes that the electromagnetic field and the neutral fluid evolve on a time scale that is long compared to the inertial time scales of charged particles , which is generally a good approximation ( see wardle & ng 1999 ) .",
    "the direction of the drift of a particle of mass @xmath71 , charge @xmath79 is determined by the relative magnitude of the magnetic and drag terms in eq ( [ eq : vj ] ) , which is characterised by the hall parameter for species @xmath70 @xmath80 i.e. the ratio of the gyrofrequency and neutral collision frequency in the definition of @xmath81 . note that apart from molecular factors , the hall parameter depends only on @xmath82 .",

    "first , it is not at all clear that protoplanetary disks are subject to ionisation by interstellar cosmic rays because super - alfvenic winds may advect them away from the disk ( as noted by gammie 1996 and glassgold et al.1997 ) , or they may be excluded by unfavourable magnetic geometry such as hour - glass shaped magnetic field lines vertically threading the disk or a wound - up field lying in the disk plane .",
    "this may be compensated by cosmic rays produced by magnetic activity near the central star or in a disk corona , but it is also unclear whether these particles are able to impinge on the disk .",
    "if cosmic rays are absent then the only significant ionisation source are x - rays from the central star .",
    "naively one might think that the active layer is then restricted to the nominal penetration depth of x - rays , i.e. @xmath166 .",
    "however , the x - ray induced active layer is much deeper than this because the unattenuated x - ray ionisation rate is so high  x - ray ionisation dominates for @xmath167 .",
    "i find that in the absence of dust grains , the active column density is @xmath2 .",
    "when dust grains are present the active layer lies within the region where x rays dominate cosmic rays in any case , so this case is unaffected by eliminating the cosmic rays .",
    "second , the calculations presented here adopt the surface density for the minimum - mass solar nebula . while this is broadly consistent with observed protoplanetary disks ( kitamura et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is possible to have surface densities 30 - 50 times higher without suffering gravitational instability .",
    "the approximate effect of adding material to the disk is to multiply up the density everywhere by the same factor .",
    "the dominant factor in the ionisation equilibrium is the shielding of the ionising fluxes of cosmic and x - rays by the overlying column of disk material . to a first approximation the active column densities discussed above are unchanged .",
    "third , i have implicitly used single size grain models to crudely mimic the effect of aggregation .",
    "some care is needed in interpreting these results because of the tendency for the smallest grains to carry a significant fraction of the grain charge .",
    "for example , although the typical grain size increases to micron scales on times that are short compared to the disk evolutionary time scale , the residual small grains implied by any stochastic aggregation process may still be important ( see , e.g.  nomura & nakagawa 2006 ) .",
    "the primary role of grains is to mop up electrons from the gas phase and render them immobile , increasing the magnetic diffusivity by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this effect is significant below the transition layer where the charge density of electrons and grains are comparable ( e.g. at @xmath168 in fig .",
    "[ fig : xun1au ] ) . above this transition ,",
    "the charge residing on grains is unimportant in determining the abundances of ions and electrons and their occasional sticking onto grains yields a mean charge @xmath169 on grains of radius @xmath11 ( spitzer 1941 ; draine & sutin 1987 ) . the total charge per unit volume carried by grains with a size distribution @xmath170 ( where the number density of grains with radii between a and @xmath171 is @xmath172 ) is therefore @xmath173 .",
    "the transition from low to high diffusivity occurs when the charge per hydrogen nucleus on grains becomes comparable to that in electrons , so the height of the magnetically active surface layer ( @xmath174 , say ) is a weak , monotonically increasing function of @xmath175 .",
    "the results presented for the 3  and 0.1grain models show that @xmath176 and 3.5 for @xmath177 cm and @xmath178 cm respectively . by way of comparison",
    ", 1% of the total grain mass residing in 0.01  grains would carry approximately the same net charge as the 0.1  grain population so a trace residual population of small grains may poison the magnetically coupled layer .    finally , although the fractional ionisation increases with height above the disk the diffusivity also increases .",
    "this is because the number density of charged particles plummets because the density is dropping as @xmath179 .",
    "this potentially affects the ability to drive a wind from the disk surface .",
    "however it should be noted that the density profile at large heights becomes increasingly unreliable due to the effects of temperature stratification and/or the presence of outflows .",
    "if dust grains have settled to the midplane , or have otherwise been removed from the gas , the ionisation level in the disk is sufficient to couple the magnetic field can to the midplane even within 1au of the central star . in this case",
    "the column density of the magnetically active region of the disk is @xmath180 .",
    "hall diffusion dominates ( wardle & ng 1999 ; sano & stone 2002 ) because the ions are decoupled form the magnetic field and electrons are not .",
    "notably , the hall effect imparts an implicit handedness to the fluid dynamics , which becomes sensitive to a global reversal of the magnetic field direction .",
    "dust grains , if present , substantially increase magnetic diffusion by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase .",
    "grains have huge cross sections for neutral collisions and this combined with their large inertia effectively decouples them from the magnetic field and the fluid becomes resistive .",
    "magnetic diffusion is so severe that the field is unable to couple to the shear in the disk except close to the disk surface . for a standard interstellar population of 0.1-radius grains",
    "the active surface layers have a combined total column @xmath0 . as grains aggregate",
    ", their effect on the ionisation equilibrium is reduced , and by the time grains have aggregated to 3 , @xmath1 .",
    "at 5au the lower column density and reduced gas density and shear means that the coupling is more easily maintained . in this case",
    "@xmath181 once grains have aggregated to 1  in size .",
    "if a substantial grain population is present , ionisation in the magnetically active layers is dominated by x - rays so that there is little change if cosmic rays are unable to impinge on the disk . in the absence of grains and cosmic rays ,",
    "stellar x - rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1au ( i.e.@xmath2 ) and almost all of it at 5au once grains have aggregated or been removed by settling , which is expected to happen on a time scale of a few thousand years ( e.g.  nomura & nakagawa 2006 ) .",
