    "the entanglement is a key ingredient of quantum mechanics @xcite . in the last decade",
    "it has been identified as a key resource for quantum information processing . in particular ,",
    "quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , certain types of quantum key distributions @xcite and quantum secret sharing protocols @xcite , are based on the existence of entangled states .",
    "the nature of quantum entanglement between two qubits is well understood by now . in particular , the necessary and sufficient condition for inseparability of two - qubit systems has been derived by peres @xcite and horodecki et al .",
    "reliable measures of bi - partite entanglement have been introduced and well analyzed ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "it is a very difficult task to generalize the analysis of entanglement from two to multi - partite systems .",
    "the multi - partite entanglement is a complex phenomenon .",
    "one of the reasons is that quantum entanglement can not be shared freely among many particles .",
    "for instance , having four qubits , we are able to prepare a state with two e - bits ( two bell pairs , as an example ) , but not more .",
    "this means that the structure of quantum mechanics imposes strict bounds on bi - partite entanglement in multi - partite systems .",
    "this issue has been first addressed by wootters et al .",
    "@xcite who have derived important bounds on shared bi - partite entanglement in multi - qubit systems .",
    "in fact , one can solve a variational problem to answer a question : what is a pure multi - partite state with specific constraints on bi - partite entanglement ?",
    "oconnors and wootters @xcite have studied what is the state of a multi - qubit ring with maximal possible entanglement between neighboring qubits .",
    "another version of the same problem has been analyzed by koashi et al .",
    "@xcite who have derived an explicit expression for the multi - qubit completely symmetric state ( entangled web ) in which all possible pairs of qubits are maximally entangled .    in his recent work dr @xcite",
    "has introduced a concept of _ entanglement molecules _ dr has shown that an arbitrary entanglement molecule can be represented by a _",
    "mixed _ state of a multi - qubit system . on the other hand in his work",
    "the problem of pure multi - partite states with specific entangled pairs of qubits has not been discussed thoroughly .",
    "specifically , dr has considered just the condition of inseparability for given set of pairs , but he did not impose a strict condition of separability for the remaining pairs of qubits .    following these ideas",
    "we analyze in the present paper an object , entangled structure , which will be called through the paper as the _ entangled graph _ @xcite . in the graph , each qubit is represented as a vertex and an edge between two vertices denotes entanglement between these two particles ( specifically , the corresponding two - qubit density operator is inseparable )",
    ". the central issue of the paper is to show that any entangled graph with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges can be associated with a _ pure _ multi - qubit state .",
    "we prove this result constructively , by showing the explicit expression of corresponding pure states .",
    "we show that any entangled graph of @xmath1 qubits can be represented by a pure state from a subspace of the whole @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space of @xmath1 qubits .",
    "the dimension of this subspace is at most quadratic in number of qubits .",
    "in general an @xmath1-partite system can exhibit various types of multi - partite correlations , ranging from bi - partite entanglement to intrinsic multi - partite correlations of the ghz nature .",
    "correlations associated with the system specify its state ( certainly , this specification is not necessarily unique ) .",
    "ideally we would like to know the whole hierarchy of quantum correlations in the multi - partite system .",
    "we are able to determine and quantify bi - partite quantum correlations .",
    "unfortunately , for existence of intrinsic @xmath1-qubit correlations we even do not have sufficient and necessary conditions ( see refs .",
    "nevertheless , as suggested by coffman , kundu and wootters @xcite it is very instructive to understand how a bi - partite entanglement is `` distributed '' in @xmath1-qubit system .",
    "the inequalities derived by these authors ( the so - called ckw inequalities ) open new possibilities how to understand the complex problem of bounds on shared entanglement .",
    "the ckw inequalities utilize the measure of entanglement called concurrence as introduced by wootters et al .",
    "this measure is defined as follows : let us assume a two - qubit system prepared in the state described by the density operator @xmath3 . from this operator one can evaluate the so - called spin - flipped operator defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pauli matrix and a star denotes a complex conjugation .",
    "now we define the matrix @xmath6 and label its ( non - negative ) eigenvalues , in decreasing order @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the concurrence",
    "is then defined as @xmath9 this function serves as an indicator whether the two - qubit system is separable ( in this case @xmath10 ) , while for @xmath11 it measures the amount of bipartite entanglement between two qubits with a number between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "larger the value of @xmath14 stronger the entanglement between two qubits is .",
    "unfortunately , no simple measures of entanglement are known for multi - qubit systems .",
    "nevertheless it is still of importance to understand how a bi - partite entanglement is distributed in @xmath1 qubit system . in this paper",
    "we will utilize a concept of entangled graph to illuminate some aspects of the problem .    using the concurrence we can easily associate an entangled graph with every @xmath1-partite state . on the other hand",
    "there is no one to one correspondence between graphs and states .",
    "for instance all separable states with @xmath1 qubits have the same graph ",
    "@xmath15  vertices and no edges . also all @xmath16-like states for @xmath17 would have the same graph .",
    "the question we are going to address can be formulated as follows : is it possible to construct at least one _ pure _ state for a given graph ?",
    "we start our discussion with the simplest non - trivial example : let us consider three qubits .",
    "pure states of three qubits can be divided into six classes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : separable states , bipartite entangled states ( three classes respective to the permutation ) , the @xmath18-type states and the @xmath16-type states . on the other hand in fig .",
    "[ 3ent ] we represent all possible graphs for a three - partite system .",
    "separable and @xmath16-like states correspond to the case ( _ a _ ) , bipartite entangled states are represented by the graph ( _ b _ ) , while the @xmath18-type states are represented by the graph ( _ c _ ) .",
    "obviously , one can imagine also an additional type of a graph , when a given qubit ( labelled as the qubit 2 ) is entangled with two others ( labelled as 1 and 3 , respectively ) , while the qubits 1 and 3 are not entangled .",
    "the question is whether this type of a graph ( see fig .",
    "1d ) can exist .",
    "does not the entanglement between qubits 1 and 2 , and 2 and 3 induce the entanglement between qubits 1 and 3 ?    in order to illuminate this simple problem let us first consider mixed states . according to dr ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) _ mixed _ states associated with the graph @xmath19 do exist and have the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a bell state .",
    "on the other hand by inspection one can check that for @xmath22 the mixed state ( [ 2.4 ] ) exhibits required correlations .    from the explicit expression for the mixed state (",
    "[ 2.4 ] ) associated with the graph @xmath19 we might try to express a _ pure _ state corresponding to the same graph as follows @xmath23 this state has requeired properties imposed on correlations betweem qubits 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 .",
    "but , it also exhibits entanglement between qubits 2 and 3 , and therefore the corresponding graph is of the type @xmath24 . in order to find a pure state for the graph @xmath19 we will consider a whole family of states of the form @xmath25 it is straightforward to calculate concurrencies for all pairs of qubits in the state ( [ 3retiazka ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath26 is always zero while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - zero for all values of involved probability amplitudes . by inspection it is possible to determine that the state ( [ 3retiazka ] ) belongs to the class of ghz states , since it contains intrinsic three - partite entanglement .",
    "we can conclude this simple example by saying that all 3-qubit entangled graphs can be realized by pure 3-qubit states .",
    "we note that the classification of states according to entangled graphs , representing the two - partite entanglement is incompatible with the classification presented in ref .",
    "we see that two types of states ( ghz states and separable states ) have the same graph . on the other hand",
    "two states of the same class ( ghz states ) can be represented by different graphs .",
    "let us first consider entangled graphs associated with mixed @xmath1-qubit states .",
    "these graphs consist of @xmath1 vertices .",
    "let the parameter @xmath2 denote the number of edges in the graph , with the condition @xmath29 then let us define a set @xmath30 with @xmath2 members",
    ". these will be pairs of qubits between which we expect entanglement ; thus for every @xmath31@xmath32 a state of the form @xmath33 exhibits entanglement between qubits @xmath34 and @xmath35 and nowhere else . in eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) the vector @xmath36 represents the maximally entangled bell state between qubits of two qubits @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the rest of @xmath37 qubits are assumed to be in the product state @xmath38 .",
    "dr in ref .",
    "@xcite has proposed a _",
    "mixed _ state of @xmath1 qubits , which corresponds to a graph defined by the set @xmath30 in the form @xmath39 it is much more complex task to find a _ pure _ state of @xmath1 qubits corresponding to a specific graph .",
    "we will solve this problem below .",
    "we start our analysis with entangled graphs that exhibit specific symmetries .",
    "certainly the two most symmetric graphs are those representing separable states [ no edges - see fig.[5ent ]  a ] and those representing @xmath18-states , with all vertices connected by edges .",
    "a representative of a pure completely separable state is described by the vector @xmath40 .",
    "the w - state @xmath41 , is a maximally symmetric state with one qubit in state @xmath42 and @xmath43 qubits in state @xmath44 ( see refs .",
    "this state maximizes the bi - partite concurrence - its value is given by the expression @xmath45 .",
    "we see that the most symmetric entangled graphs do correspond to specific pure multi - qubit states .",
    "let us now consider graphs with a lower symmetry .",
    "for instance , a star - shaped graph ( fig.[5ent ] .",
    "c ) . in this case , the given qubit is ( equally ) entangled with all other qubits in the system , that in turn are not entangled with any other qubit .",
    "dr @xcite has proposed an explicit expression for a pure state associated with this type of entangled graph : @xmath46 in fact , this state maximizes the concurrence between the first and any other qubit .",
    "but , the remaining qubits are still mutually entangled .",
    "so the state ( [ 3.5 ] ) is represented by the graph @xmath47 ( all vertices are connected ) rather than graph @xmath24 . in our analysis",
    "we require more stringent constraints than in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the conditions on the presence of entanglement between specific qubits have been imposed .",
    "we require the conditions ( [ 3.2 ] ) , that is the presence and absence of bi - partite entanglement for given pairs of qubits in the system .",
    "we find that a pure state which indeed is represented by the star - shaped graph ( see fig .",
    "[ 5ent ]  c ) is given by the expression @xmath48 with the normalization condition @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 , the reduced two - qubit density operator for the first and any other qubit in the system reads @xmath51 one of the eigenvalues of the partially transformed matrix @xmath52 is negative for every @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , using the peres - horodecki criterion we see that the first qubit is indeed entangled with any other qubit in the system for any non - trivial value of @xmath54 .",
    "now we have to show , that all other qubits in the system are not mutually entangled ( i.e. all pairs of qubits @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are separable ) .",
    "the reduced density operator describing a state of qubits @xmath34 and @xmath35 reads @xmath57 the smallest eigenvalue of the partially transposed operator is @xmath58 where @xmath59 we see that for all @xmath60 such that @xmath61 the smallest eigenvalue @xmath62 is non - negative .",
    "consequently , the corresponding density operator is separable .",
    "thus we have found a family of states , that correspond to the desired graph .",
    "for the special case of @xmath63 , the reduced operators have a form different from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) and also the final condition is more complicated .",
    "however , it is quite easy to find one example of the state of four qubits corresponding to the star - shaped graph .",
    "the state vector reads : @xmath64    above we have analyzed the most symmetric entangled graphs . in what follows we propose a general algorithm how to construct a pure state for an arbitrary graph .",
    "let us consider a pure state of @xmath1 ( @xmath50 ) qubits described by the vector @xmath65 . in what follows",
    "we will show that for a certain range of parameters this state matches a graph given by the condition ( [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "firstly , we show that a pair of qubits @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that @xmath66 is indeed entangled .",
    "the corresponding reduced density operator reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of connections originating from the @xmath34th vertex ( the number of qubits we wish to have entangled with the @xmath34th one ) and @xmath69 is the number of vertices , that are connected directly with the @xmath34th and @xmath35th vertex .",
    "the following inequalities for these variables hold : @xmath70 one of the eigenvalues of the density operator obtained by the partial transposition of the operator ( [ 3.14 ] ) reads @xmath71 in the non - trivial case of @xmath72 we need only to show that @xmath73 from which it follows that if the condition @xmath74 is fulfilled then a specific pair qubits described by the density operator ( [ 3.14 ] ) is entangled .",
    "till now we have proved that a specific pair of qubits in multi - partite system is entangled . in order , to show that the corresponding state vector indeed is associated with a desired entangled graph we have to show that all other pairs of qubits are separable .",
    "density operators for pairs of qubits @xmath75 are given by the expression : @xmath76 with the involved parameters satisfying the set of inequalities @xmath77    instead of checking that all the eigenvalues of the corresponding partially transposed operator are non - negative , we will show that under certain conditions the concurrence of the state ( [ maticabez ] ) will be zero .",
    "the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath78 given by eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) are @xmath79 and , according to the definition of the concurrence ( [ c ] ) , it is enough to show that @xmath80 ( since then @xmath81 is the maximal eigenvalue and already @xmath82 and so the concurrence vanishes ) .",
    "that is , we require that @xmath83 ) we obtain the final condition @xmath84 which guarantees that the state ( [ maticabez ] ) is separable .",
    "one can check that there are many states which fulfill the conditions ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , let us assume the state ( [ 3.12 ] ) with @xmath85 this state indeed corresponds to the desired graph .",
    "this proves that one can associate with an arbitrary entangled graph a pure state .",
    "moreover , by construction we have proved that in general this state is a superposition of at most @xmath86 vectors from the @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space of @xmath1 qubits .",
    "we have introduced a concept of the _ entangled graphs _ : that is an entangled multi - qubit structure such that every qubit is represented by a vertex while entanglement between two qubits is represented as an edge between relevant vertices .",
    "we have shown that for every possible graph with non - weighted ( see below ) edges there exists a _",
    "pure _ state , which represents the graph .",
    "moreover , such state can be constructed as a superposition of small number of states from a subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "the dimension of this subspace grows linearly with the number of entangled pairs ( thus , in the worst case , quadratically with the number of particles ) .",
    "it is clear that introducing a `` weight '' to the edges of the graphs would lead to new interesting questions .",
    "the weight should correspond to a value of the concurrence between the two qubits that are connected by the given edge .",
    "dr in ref .",
    "@xcite has addressed this question briefly in the context of mixed states associated with entanglement molecules . as shown in our paper ,",
    "the issue of shared bi - partite entanglement in _ pure _ multi - qubit systems is much more complex issue .",
    "nevertheless , it is of great interest to find out some general bounds on the amount of possible shared bipartite entanglement in a given entangled graph .",
    "another problem directly related to the issue of weighted graphs is how to maximize bi - partite entanglement for given graphs .",
    "there , for every graph one could find the optimal state with maximal concurrencies on defined pairs of qubits , as it was made for specific cases in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "states with defined bipartite entanglement properties are of a possible practical use : in communications protocols , like quantum secret sharing @xcite or quantum oblivious transfer @xcite one needs many - particle states with specific bipartite entanglement properties . therefore deep understanding of possible entangled graphs can help us to understand structure of quantum correlation and the corresponding bounds on quantum communications and quantum information processing .",
