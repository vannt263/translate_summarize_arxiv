    "quantum entanglement is considered as the central resource for quantum information processing @xcite , such as quantum computation , quantum dense coding , quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , etc . however , quantum entanglement is still not full known by researchers .",

    "maps @xcite up to date may be the most powerful method among various separability criteria . for any entangled state ,",
    "there exists at least a positive but not completely positive map to detect it . as a consequence of the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism @xcite , entanglement witnesses ( ews ) @xcite play the role to detect entanglement equivalently .",
    "an observable @xmath0 is said an ew if ( i ) the expectation value of @xmath1 is non - negative for any separable state ; and ( ii ) it is negative for at least an entangled state .",
    "naturally , ( iii ) @xmath2 keeps all properties of @xmath1 as an ew for a non - negative number @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath2 is the same ew as @xmath1 .",
    "an ew which detects a maximal set of entanglement is defined to be optimal in ref .",
    "an ew whose expectation value vanishes on at least one product vector is said to be weakly optimal @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for an ew @xmath1 to be optimal is that there must exist a separable @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is , however , a sufficient condition for the weakly optimal ew ( woew ) but not for the optimal ew ( oew ) .",
    "we say @xmath6 is finer than @xmath7 if the entangled state detected by @xmath6 is more than the one by @xmath7 @xcite .    for our purpose",
    ", we can only consider the quantum states on the finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "we let dim@xmath9 , dim@xmath10 and dim@xmath11 .",
    "our recent work @xcite showed that any ew @xmath1 can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath4 is a ( normalized ) separable density matrix and @xmath13 is a real number related to @xmath4 , @xmath14 is the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath4 and @xmath15 is the maximum number in @xmath16 which makes @xmath17 an ew and @xmath18 is any unit product vector .",
    "clearly , an ew @xmath19 is weakly optimal if and only if @xmath20 , and there exists a separable density matrix @xmath4 with @xmath21 for any oew @xmath22 .",
    "recently , a conjecture that spa to optimal positive maps correspond to entanglement - breaking maps ( channels ) has been posed in @xcite .",
    "an equivalent presentation of the conjecture ( called spa conjeture ) is that spa to optimal entanglement witnesses correspond to separable ( unnormalized ) states , i.e. , the spa to an optimal ew @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the smallest parameter for which @xmath25 is a positive operator ( possibly unnormalized state ) @xcite .",
    "based on this result , we found that the spa conjecture does not depend on the optimality of ews .",
    "we have found that the separability problems of spa to both optimal ews and non - optimal ews become the same problem , that is , whether any @xmath26 is separable with @xmath17 being an ew ( @xmath27 being an oew ) @xcite",
