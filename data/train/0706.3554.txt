    "one hundred years after einstein , the theory of general relativity ( gr ) is still our best theory of gravity . in the framework of gr",
    ", the standard model of cosmology ( @xmath4 ) provides a successful description of the universe . in this model , the same fluctuations which give rise to the observed small variations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "grow under the force of gravity , and eventually form observed galaxies and other nonlinear structures such as filaments , voids , groups and clusters of galaxies . according to the model , only @xmath5 of the density in the universe is provided by normal baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4   model requires two additional components : a non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) , which contributes about 30% of the average density of the universe , and an even more mysterious dark energy , which makes up the rest @xcite .",
    "the model is remarkably successful on scales larger than a few megaparsecs .",
    "it predicted the amplitude and the spectrum of angular fluctuations in the cmb and in the distribution of galaxies @xcite that were later confirmed by observations @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath4   model faces challenges on smaller scales .",
    "the most difficult ones are related with the rotation in the inner parts of spiral galaxies .",
    "it seems that the theory predicts too much dark matter inside @xmath6  1kpc from the centers of galaxies @xcite . while there are some possible solutions of the problem @xcite , the problems on small scales are the strongest challenge the standard model has encountered .",
    "when compounded with the fact that there is no direct evidence of dark matter or dark energy , the current problems of the standard cosmological model have encouraged a small but growing community of physicists to propose alternative theories of gravity to avoid the need for dark matter .",
    "this is the case for modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , proposed by @xcite to explain the rotation of galaxies without dark matter . according to mond",
    ", the rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies do not decline because the force of gravity is significantly stronger than for newtonian gravity . at early times",
    "mond s main appeal was its simplicity : there is no need to make the assumption that the universe is filled with particles that nobody has seen .",
    "additional motivation came later from difficulties with explaining anomalies in the trajectories of the pioneer 10 and 11 space missions @xcite .    yet , for a long time mond was not more than a conjecture . only recently , bekenstein proposed a relativistic version named tensor vector scalar theory ( teves ) @xcite .",
    "this alternative theory of gravity provides a framework to make predictions of numerous important observational phenomena , which @xmath4   has already done : the temperature fluctuations seen in the cmb , gravitational lensing , and the large scale structure of the universe . with maturity",
    "came problems .",
    "rotation curves of some galaxies  the initial strong argument for mond  can not be explained by mond . in about 1/4 of galaxies considered by proponents of mond",
    "the predicted velocities are well above the observations in the very central regions @xcite .",
    "rms velocities of stars in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite also present problems .",
    "so far , the most severe challenges for mond are coming from clusters of galaxies .",
    "dynamics of galaxies in clusters can not be explained by mond and requires introduction of dark matter , possibly in the form of a massive ( @xmath7ev ) neutrino @xcite .",
    "we do not know whether this modification can explain some properties of clusters of galaxies such as the `` bullet cluster '' , where the baryonic mass ( galaxies and gas ) is clearly separated from the gravitational mass , as indicated by gravitational lensing @xcite . in any case",
    ", for mond to survive too it must invoke dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos and dark energy in the form of an arbitrary constant added to a combination of two scalar fields used in teves mond @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that alternative theories of gravity represent a challenge to the standard model of cosmology and gr .",
    "any theory or model must respond to these challenges . here",
    "we present a number of observations to test gravity and dark matter in the peripheral parts of galaxies at distances 50 - 500  kpc from the centers of galaxies .",
    "these scales can be tested by studying the motion of satellites of galaxies .",
    "this is a relatively old field in extragalactic astronomy and historically it was one of main arguments for the presence of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the observational results drawn from the sdss and the predictions from the standard model of cosmology .",
    "predictions from mond are computed and discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "we use the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; www.sdss.org )  the largest photometric and spectroscopic astronomical survey ever undertaken of the local universe  to study the motion of satellites . as of data release four ( dr4 ) @xcite , imaging data are available over 6670  deg@xmath8 in five photometric bands .",
    "in addition to the ccd imaging , the sdss 2.5 m telescope on apache point , new mexico , measured spectra of galaxies , providing distance determinations .",
    "approximately half million of galaxies brighter than @xmath9 over 4700  deg@xmath8 have been targeted for spectroscopic observations as part of sdss and are included in dr4 .",
    "redshift accuracy is better than 30  km / s and the overall completeness is @xmath690% . for our study",
    "we compute rest frame absolute magnitudes in the g - band from the extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes assuming a @xmath10 cosmology with a hubble constant @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = @xmath13 ) .",
    "galaxies are split into red ( early - types ) and blue ( late - types ) populations based on the bimodality observed in the @xmath14 color distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "the local minima between the peaks of the color distribution occur near @xmath15 .",
    "all magnitudes and colors are k - corrected to @xmath16 . because calculations of mond gravity for non - spherical objects are complicated",
    ", we restrict our analysis only to red galaxies , the vast majority of which are either elliptical galaxies or are dominated by bulges .",
    "our galaxy sample was selected from the full redshift sample by taking all galaxies with recession velocity 3000  km / s  @xmath17  km / s .",
    "the total number of selected galaxies is about 215,000 .",
    "the sdss heliocentric velocities were converted to the local group standard of rest before computing distances .",
    "we select our host galaxies as galaxies with absolute g - band magnitude brighter than @xmath18 and isolated : a galaxy must be at least 4 times brighter than any other galaxy within a projected distance @xmath19  mpc and a line - of - sight velocity difference @xmath20  km / s .",
    "we define satellites as all galaxies being at least 4 times fainter than their hosts and found within a projected distance @xmath21  kpc and velocity difference @xmath22  km / s with respect to their hosts .",
    "typically we find about 1.5 satellites per host .",
    "in total we have 9500 satellites with a mean luminosity of about @xmath23 .",
    "we bin the host galaxies by luminosity and collect information about the distribution of relative velocities @xmath24 and the number of satellites as the function of projected distance @xmath25 .",
    "figure  1 presents the observational results for primaries , which are at least 6 times brighter than any satellite .",
    "we also used primaries , which are 4 times brighter , and primaries , which are 10 times brighter than their satellites .",
    "we do not find any trend with the primary - satellite magnitude gap : results are nearly the same ( see section 3 for details ) .",
    "the only difference is the statistics , and , thus , the error - bars .",
    "the distribution of line - of - sight velocities ( top right panel ) clearly shows a two - component structure : a homogeneous background of interloper galaxies ( dwarfs which happen to lie along the line - of - sight , with large physical distances from the host galaxies but small projected and velocity differences , but which are not associated with the host ) and a nearly gaussian component .",
    "the surface density of the satellites also shows the same structure : at large separations the number density goes to a constant due to interlopers .",
    "we subtract the background and plot the surface density of satellites in the bottom right panel . in order to study the velocity dispersion of satellites @xmath26 as a function of projected distance @xmath25 we use a maximum likelihood method to approximate the number of satellites @xmath27 per unit projected area and per unit velocity difference @xmath24 using an 9-parameter function in the form of a constant plus a gaussian distribution with variable velocity dispersion and normalization : @xmath28/\\sqrt { 2\\pi}\\sigma+ n_0 , \\label{eq : delta}\\ ] ] where the surface number - density of satellites @xmath29 and the rms line - of - sight velocity @xmath30 are 3th order shifted chebyshev polynomials of the first kind .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is a constant representing the background of interlopers .",
    "the left panel in figure  1 shows the resulting rms velocity of satellites for three magnitude bins . in order to estimate statistical uncertainties",
    ", we run monte carlo simulations using the same number of hosts and satellites as in the corresponding magnitude bin in figure  1 .",
    "note that the data points are correlated .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to test statistical significance that the observed velocities are declining with distance : data for each magnitude bin reject a constant @xmath32 at about @xmath33 confidence level .",
    "we also studied blue galaxies and find declining velocities for them .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous estimates @xcite , but we now can exclude constant rms velocities much more reliably .",
    "in order to compare observational results with the @xmath4   predictions , we use high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations @xcite , which we then treat as if they are the observational data .",
    "the simulations were done for the standard @xmath4model with parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath11 , @xmath36 .",
    "we use two simulations .",
    "both simulation had @xmath37 particles .",
    "one simulation had the computational box 120  @xmath38mpc box , mass resolution @xmath39 and force resolution 1.8  @xmath38kpc .",
    "the second simulation has the computational box 80  @xmath38mpc box , mass resolution @xmath40 and force resolution 1.2  @xmath38kpc .",
    "we do not find any differences between the simulations and decided to present results of the larger simulation , which provides better statistics of halos .",
    "we select isolated halos as halos , which within projected distance of 715  kpc and within relative velocity difference 1000  km / s do not have halos or subhalos with maximum circular larger than 1/2 of the halo s circular velocity .",
    "this corresponds to the mass ratio of a factor ten for distrinct halos .",
    "circular velocities are better characteristics of subhalos , which have poorly defined masses .",
    "although we resolve subhalos , we dicided to use dark matter particles as proxies for satellites . at distances larger than a fraction ( 1/4- 1/3 ) of a virial radius from center of a halo satellites",
    "trace the motion and the spacial distribution of the dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "results presented in figures 1 and 2 show that all three characteristics of observed satellites are reproduced by the model .",
    "note that we actually do not make fits .",
    "results from simulations have only one parameter : the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo .",
    "we just plot what we obtain from the simulations .",
    "once we fix the maximum circular velocity , the results are fairly insensitive to parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "two factors may affect the shape of the theoretical v - r diagram : the halo concentration and the velocity anysotropy .",

    ", the exact value of the halo concentration affects only the central region @xmath48  kpc .",
    "the average halo concentration depends weakly on the amplitude of the perturbations @xmath44 .",
    "existing observational data leave only very narrow range for variation of @xmath49 , which also limits the range of concentrations .",
    "the velocity anisotropy is less certain , but it is not large .",
    "n - body simulations indicate that @xmath50 is slightly positive and has a tendency to increase with the distance for radii smaller than the virial radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with typical values @xmath51 for halo masses considered in this paper . at larger distances",
    "@xmath50 declines and goes to zero @xcite .    in order to demonstrate that our results of n - body simulations are robust and reliable , we use solutions of the jeans equation , which we obtain for parameters compatible with numerous previous simulations . once a solution for the radial velocity dispersion is obtained ,",
    "we integrate it along a line of sight with appropriate corrections for the velocity anisotropy . for the density use the nfw profiles with concentration @xmath52 . for the sake of completeness , we add the cosmological background density , which has only a small effect at large distances . for @xmath50",
    "we use approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : betb ] ) with parameters chosen in such a way that @xmath53 and at @xmath54  kpc @xmath55 .",
    "we use the same range of circular velocities as in figure  [ fig : two ] . for more massive halos we use @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for less massive halos we adopted @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "results presented in figure  [ fig : jeans ] clearly indicate that very simple stationary models can accurately reproduce results of simulations .",
    "the situation is different for mond because there are no predictions on the same level of sophistication as for @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", those predictions can be made , but at this moment they have not been yet made .",
    "thus , we have only one option : solve the jeans equation for spherical systems .",
    "when doing so , we have a freedom of choosing two functions : the number - density profile of satellites and the velocity anisotropy @xmath60 .",
    "we also have two free parameters : stellar mass @xmath61 and the magnitude of external force ( see below for details ) .",
    "the predictions are constrained by two functions @xmath29 and @xmath62 .",
    "the velocity distribution function also gives constraints , but those are relatively weak .",
    "only the models with a large @xmath63 can be excluded .",
    "the stellar luminosity and colors constrain the stellar mass . roughly speaking we have two arbitrary functions to fit two observed functions .",
    "it should not be difficult given that the model is viable .    in our case",
    "the jeans equation for the radial velocity dispersion @xmath64 can be written in the form :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the velocity anisotropy and @xmath67 is the gravitational acceleration . the formal solution of the jeans equation can be written in the form :    @xmath68    @xmath69 .",

    "for mond the acceleration of spherical systems @xmath77 is given by the solution of the non - linear equation @xmath78 where @xmath61 is the mass of only baryons and @xmath79 .",
    "the term @xmath80 is the external constant gravitational acceleration .",
    "it formally breaks the spherical symmetry .",
    "thus , the eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmond ] ) is only an approximation valid for small external force .",
    "here we use the same approximation as eq .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite , which we average over angles between a constant external acceleration @xmath80 and internal radial acceleration @xmath77 .",
    "the function @xmath81 can have different shapes .",
    "we tried the originally proposed form @xcite @xmath82 , but accepted and used for all our analysis the function @xmath83 , which gives slightly better results .",
    "the function @xmath84 is limited by the observations presented in figure  1 .",
    "the velocity anisotropy @xmath60 is a free function , but there are constraints .",
    "asymptotically @xmath50 goes to zero at large distances where gravitational effect of the central galaxy diminishes .",
    "ideally the velocity anisotropy at small distances also should be declining .",
    "there are different arguments why this should be the case .",
    "( 1 ) the tangential velocities of few satellites of the milky way , for which the proper motions are measured , strongly reject radial orbits @xcite .",
    "there is no reason to believe that our galaxy should be special in this respect .",
    "( 2 ) experience with gravitational dynamical systems indicate that in dynamically relaxed systems @xmath85 .",
    "numerous simulations of cosmological models illustrate this : @xmath50 is small in the central region and increases to @xmath86 at the viral radius @xcite .",
    "note that we should distinguish the velocity anisotropy and the orbital eccentricity . for centrally concentrated objects , which we are dealing with here ,",
    "already isotropic velocities imply typical peri-/apocenter ratios of 1:4 - 1:5 .",
    "if eccentricity is larger , a significant fraction of satellites comes too close to the central @xmath87  kpc region where the satellites are destroyed by tidal forces .",
    "the term @xmath88 in eq.([eq : gmond ] ) describes the effect of external gravitational field .",
    "it is specific for mond . in newtonian dynamics",
    "a homogeneous external gravity does not affect relative motions inside the object . because the mond gravity is nonlinear , the internal force is affected by the external field ( note that this is not the tidal force ) .",
    "this external effect is quite complicated .",
    "the magnitude of the external force is substantial for the motion of the satellites .",
    "@xcite point out that in mond numerous sources and effects generate about equal magnitude of @xmath89 .",
    "for example , 600  km / s motion of the local group relative to the cmb implies acceleration of 600  km / s@xmath90  gyrs@xmath91 . here",
    "we assume that the acceleration is constant over the whole age of the universe .",
    "if @xmath89 increases with time , as it may be expected , then the acceleration is even larger .",
    "infall with @xmath92  km / s in the direction of virgo gives about half of the value .",
    "m31 produces about the same magnitude of the acceleration .",
    "while the acceleration in mond does not add linearly , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath93 .",
    "we will explore the effect the external field later .      in order to make mond predictions , we must estimate the stellar mass for galaxies in our analysis . for two subsamples presented in figure  [ fig : tuned ]",
    "we use the magnitude bins @xmath94 ( 2400 satellites ) and @xmath95 ( 2700 satellites ) .",
    "the average luminosities of galaxies in the bins are @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "when estimating the luminosities , we assume @xmath98 @xcite . using measured @xmath99 colors we estimate the stellar masses of galaxies @xcite : @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the two luminosity bins .",
    "this implies the mass - to - light ratios are nearly the same for the bins : @xmath102 .",
    "these @xmath103 estimates are close to predictions of stellar population models . in our case , the galaxies are red ( @xmath104 ) , old mostly ellipticals , for which we expect nearly solar metallicity .",
    "indeed , @xcite gives @xmath105 for the kroupa imf for stellar population 10  gyrs old .",
    "adjusting for the 0.4 mag difference between b and g bands , we get @xmath106 ( the salpeter imf gives @xmath107 ) .",
    "larger metallicity is highly unlikely ( the galaxies are not really massive ellipticals ) and it does not make much difference : 10 percent increase if we take twice the solar metallicity .    using different functional forms for @xmath60 , we solve the equations numerically and then integrate the solution along the line - of - sight to get a prediction for @xmath108 .",
    "figure  2 presents results for the two different magnitude ranges and for different parameters @xmath109const and @xmath110const .",
    "mond definitely has problems fitting the data because for any constant @xmath50 it predicts a sharply declining rm velocity at small distances followed by nearly flat velocities at large distances .",
    "the data show just the opposite behavior .",
    "it is easy to understand why predictions of mond has this shape . at large distances",
    "the newtonian acceleration is very small and the acceleration is strongly dominated by the mond correction : @xmath111 . in this case , the solution of eq.(1 ) gives @xmath112const for _ any _ constant value @xmath50 and @xmath70 .",
    "we can try to salvage mond , but so far there is no simple way of doing it .",
    "@xcite find that the way to improve the situation is to have a model with variable slope @xmath70 and with extremely radial orbits .",
    "we also tried different functional forms and numerous combinations of parameters . while the parameters , which fit the surface density and the rms velocities vary , they all give the same answer : density slope in the central 40  kpc should be @xmath113 and the velocity anisotropy at large distances should be @xmath114 . figure  [ fig : tuned ] shows ( dashed curves ) the results for the same set of parameters as in @xcite : @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117  kpc , @xmath118  kpc , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "here we use the approximation given in eq.([eq : betb ] ) .",
    "the solution is very contrived : relatively small deviations from the best behavior ( small slope in the center and radial orbits in the outer radii ) result in failed fits .",
    "the full curves in the figure show what happens when the velocity anisotropy gets less radial : @xmath121 .",
    "even this fine - tuned solution fails unless the mass - to - light ratio for the larger magnitude bin is arificially increased by a factor of two : @xmath122 , which gives @xmath123 .",
    "@xcite also found the same trend , but they made two mistakes , which did not allow them to clearly see the problem .",
    "first , the solar mass - to - light ratio was used for the b band instead of the g band .",
    "second , the width of the magnitude bin is presented as an error in m / l giving impression of very large uncertainties in m / l .",
    "this is not correct : the statistical uncertainty of the average luminosity of galaxies in each bin is very low and can be neglected .",
    "it should be noted that there is nothing special about the galaxies , which are used here .",
    "the average luminosities differ by a factor 1.7 .",
    "so , it is not a large difference .",
    "colors of the galaxies are practically the same , which then gives the same m / l if we use stellar population models .",
    "the rms velocities are also perfectly consistent with simple scaling .",
    "for example , the ratio of rms velocities at the same projected distance of 70  kpc is 1.3 implying simple scaling @xmath124 . roughly speaking , we double the luminosity and that doubles the stellar mass",
    ". this does not work for mond : it needs twice more stellar mass .",
    "this is definitely a problem because there is no justification why galaxies with the same colors , with the same old population and practically the same luminosity should have dramatically different imf .",
    "the differences are very large : most of the stellar mass in the more luminous bin should be locked up in dwarfs with @xmath125 , while there is relatively little of those in the lower bin , which is consistent with the kroupa imf .    in order to make the argument even more clear , we make analysis of velocities in a different way .",
    "this time we split the sample by stellar mass , but we still keep only red primaries with @xmath126 .",
    "we make the analysis twice : for satellites 4 times and for satellites 10 times less bright than the primary galaxy .",
    "there is no systematic difference between the two isolation conditions : within @xmath127 the results are the same .",
    "figure  [ fig : stmass ] illustrates this point .",
    "we select primary galaxies to have the stellar mass in the range @xmath128 .",
    "the average stellar mass is @xmath129 , and the average luminosity is @xmath130 .",
    "there is a hint that more isolated primaries have slightly _ larger _ velocities of satellites .",
    "still , the differences are not statistically significant : for radii larger than 50  kpc the differences are smaller than 10  km / s .",
    "then we take the observed stellar mass and use it for mond models and apply the best tuned parameters .",
    "we find that parameters suggested by @xcite ( @xmath131  kpc , @xmath132 , @xmath120 ) improve the fits as compared with a constant @xmath50 models .",
    "still , they are not acceptable . for example , at @xmath133  kpc the mond model is a @xmath134 deviation .",
    "we found a better solution ( @xmath135  kpc and other parameters the same ) , which places mond `` only '' at @xmath136 .    in order to envestigate what stellar mass",
    "is needed for mond , we split the sample of red primaries into 5 mass bins ranging from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "we chose the less stringent isolation condition because it gives typically 2 - 2.5 time more satellites resulting in smaller statistical errors .",
    "each bin has a large number of satellites : @xmath139 .",
    "we then run a grid of mond models with different masses and select models , which make best fits .",
    "just as the mond models in figure  [ fig : tuned ] , there are models , which marginally fit the data . for each model",
    "we get stellar mass required by mond and compare it with the stellar mass estimated by the stellar population models .",
    "results are presented in figure  [ fig : mondmass ] . for smaller masses mond",
    "gives masses , which are compatible with actual stellar mass observed in the galaxies .",
    "the plot clearly shows the problem with massive galaxies : mond requires increasingly more mass than observed in the galaxies ending up in large ( @xmath140 ) disagreement with the observations .    the external gravity force @xmath89 is another mond component .",
    "it must exist on the level of @xmath141 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tunedext ] shows what happens to the models when we add the external force . as the starting models we use the best fits shown in the figure  [ fig : tuned ] as dashed curves .",
    "the models with the external force make the fits much worse .",
    "taken at face value , the models with realistic @xmath142 can be rejected .",
    "again , we can make the model work if we increase m / l by a factor @xmath143 .",
    "yet , this will make the situation with stellar masses even worse , than what we already have .",
    "using the sdss dr4 data we study the distribution and velocities of satellites orbiting red isolated galaxies .",
    "we find that the surface number - density of the satellites declines almost as a power law with the slope @xmath144 .",
    "the distribution of the line - of - sight velocities is nearly a perfect gaussian distribution with a constant component due to interlopers .",
    "the rms velocities are found to gradually decline with the projected distance .",
    "the constant rms velocity ( isothermal solution ) can be rejected at a 10  @xmath145 level .",
    "observational data strongly favor the standard cosmological model : all three major statistics of satellites ",
    "the number - density profile , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , and the distribution function of the velocities  agree remarkably well with the theoretical predictions .",
    "thus , the success of the standard model extends to scales ( 50 - 500 )  kpc , much lower than what was previously considered .",
    "mond fails badly in cases with any acceptable power- law approximation for the number - density of satellites and a constant velocity anisotropy by producing sharply declining velocities at small distances followed by nearly flat velocities at large distances  just the opposite of what is observed in real galaxies .",
    "models may be made to fit the satellites data only when all the following conditions are fulfilled :    1 .",
    "the slope of the density in the central 50  kpc is less then -2 .",
    "satellite velocities are nearly radial in outer regions ( @xmath146 at @xmath3  kpc ) .",
    "mass - to - light ratio increases from @xmath147 at @xmath148 to @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) at @xmath151 .",
    "external force of gravity is smaller than the expected value of @xmath89 @xmath91 .",
    "the negative effect of the external force can be removed by additionally increasing the m / l ratios .",
    "we find that the later three conditions are difficult to realize in nature .",
    "satellites do not fall in to their parent galaxies with zero tangential velocities .",
    "the velocities are induced by other neighboring galaxies and by large - scale structures such as filaments . to some degree , it is similar to the tidal torque , which is responsible for the origin of the angular momentum of galaxies . yet , the interactions are more efficient for providing random velocities",

    "the gravitational pull of other large galaxies in the aria is larger than that of the milky way and we expect that the same deviations exist for the perpendicular velocity components .",
    "when a satellite with 70 - 80  km / s falls falls from 1  mpc and gets to 400  kpc from mw its tangential velocity increases few times ( conservation of the angular momentum ) .",
    "so , we expect @xmath152 .",
    "we have the same measurements for the satellites in sdss .",
    "when we look at distances 0.81  mpc , we find that the rms velocities hardly correlate with the luminosity and are about 100  km / s .",
    "note that @xmath4perfectly fits the constraint : at these distances it predicts @xmath153 .",
    "thus , mond assumption of very radial orbits does not agree with the observations .",
    "the large m / l ratios is another problem for mond .",
    "so far m / l was treated almost as a free parameter @xcite .",
    "this is not correct .",
    "it should be reminded that observationally there are no indications of large variability of imf for vastly different stellar ages and metallicities .",
    "the imf shows similar flattening for masses smaller than @xmath154 in the solar neighborhood and in the spheroid @xcite , in the galactic bulge @xcite , and in the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite .",
    "the galactic bulge has parameters similar to the red galaxies studied in this paper : very old ( on average ) stellar population with nearly solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite give the @xmath155 , which corresponds to @xmath156 .",
    "this is close to what we found for the red galaxies in sdss .    in the case",
    "studied here , mond requires that m / l changes by a factor 2 - 2.5 when there is no change in colors and the absolute magnitude changes only by @xmath157 .",
    "there is no justification for this to happen .",
    "the situation is similar to what @xcite found for early type large spirals where mond models fail for any imf discussed in recent 20 years .",
    "only the salpeter imf gives better results .",
    "even in this case the models deviate by a factor of two around the stellar population predictions .",
    "the combination of all these problems makes mond a very implausible solution for the observational data on satellites of galaxies .",
    "there is one significant difference between mond and @xmath4 .",
    "the latter makes predictions for the distribution of mass and velocities for isolated galaxies and those predictions match the observational data .",
    "there are no theoretical predictions for mond .",
    "what we conveniently called `` mond predictions '' were actually _",
    "requirements_. for example , mond must produce the radial velocities of satellites or shallow slope of the number - density in the central region .",
    "we thank s.  mcgaugh for challenging us to do mondian analysis of the satellite motion .",
    "we are grateful to j.  holtzman for numerous comments and suggestions and thank j. betancort - rijo for comments .",
    "we are especially grateful to angus et al for providing us with the draft of their paper and for extensive discussions .",
    "we still have different ways of looking at the situation with mond .",
    "still , these productive discussions resulted in improvements in their and our papers .",
