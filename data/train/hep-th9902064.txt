    "the effective action plays a central role in quantum field theory . here",
    "we consider the one - loop effective action in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) for electrons in the presence of a background electromagnetic field : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is a fixed classical gauge potential with field strength tensor @xmath4 .",
    "when the background is a static magnetic field , the effective action @xmath5 is equal to minus the effective energy of the electrons in that background ; and when the background is an electric field , @xmath5 has an imaginary part which determines the pair - production rate for electron - positron pair creation @xcite . for a uniform background field strength @xmath6 , the effective action @xmath5 can be computed exactly @xcite . for more general backgrounds , with @xmath7 _ not _ constant , the situation is more complicated .",
    "one standard approach is to make a `` derivative expansion '' @xcite ( or `` gradient expansion '' @xcite ) which is a formal perturbative expansion in increasing numbers of derivatives of @xmath7 : @xmath8+s^{(2)}[f,(\\partial f)^2]+\\dots \\label{derivative}\\ ] ] in this paper we address two questions concerning the qed effective action @xmath5 in a nonuniform background .",
    "first , we consider the convergence / divergence properties of the perturbative derivative expansion in ( [ derivative ] ) .",
    "second , we ask how such a perturbative expansion can lead to corrections to schwinger s nonperturbative pair - production rate ( computed for a constant background ) when there are inhomogeneities in the background electric field .",
    "we can answer these questions precisely by considering some exactly solvable cases with special inhomogeneous backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the derivative expansion is found to be a divergent asymptotic series , and the rate of divergence at high orders can be used to compute the corresponding non - perturbative imaginary part of the effective action when the background is a time - dependent electric field .",
    "this divergence of the derivative expansion is not a bad thing ; it is completely analogous to generic behavior that is well known in perturbation theory in both quantum field theory and quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , dyson @xcite argued that qed perturbation theory can not be convergent as an expansion in the fine structure constant @xmath9 , because the theory is unstable when @xmath9 is negative .",
    "( the divergent and asymptotic nature of field theoretic perturbation theory was also found in scalar @xmath10 theories @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the euler - heisenberg - schwinger qed effective action in a constant background , and the qed effective action in the inhomogeneous backgrounds discussed in this paper , provide explicit demonstrations of dyson s argument .",
    "our analysis of the convergence / divergence properties of the qed effective action uses borel summation @xcite , a mathematical tool that can be used to relate the rate of divergence of high orders of perturbation theory to non - perturbative decay and tunneling rates , thereby providing a bridge between perturbative and non - perturbative physics .",
    "other well known explicit cases of this connection appear in quantum mechanical examples such as the anharmonic oscillator @xcite and the stark effect @xcite , and in quantum field theory in semi - classical analyses of scalar field theories @xcite and asymptotic estimates of large orders of qed perturbation theory @xcite . for an excellent review of a broad range of examples , see ref .",
    "typically one finds that in a stable situation ( _ i.e. _ , no tunneling or decay processes ) perturbation theory is divergent , with expansion coefficients that alternate in sign and grow factorially in magnitude . on the other hand , in an unstable situation ,",
    "perturbation theory is generally divergent with coefficients that grow factorially in magnitude but do not alternate in sign .",
    "borel summation is an approach to the summation of divergent series that makes physical sense out of these two different types of behavior .",
    "we shall see that the divergence of the derivative expansion can be understood naturally in this borel framework .",
    "in addition to these theoretical considerations of understanding the connections between the perturbative derivative expansion and non - perturbative pair - production rates , another motivation for this work is provided by the attempt to observe electron - positron pair creation due to qed vacuum effects in the presence of strong electric fields .",
    "schwinger s constant field pair - production rate is far too small to be accessible with present electric field strengths .",
    "however , the constant field approximation is somewhat unrealistic , and so one can ask how this rate is modified by a time variation of the electric background . for sinusoidal time variation brzin and",
    "itzykson found a wkb result with fairly weak frequency dependence @xcite , while balantekin _",
    "et al _ have applied group theory and uniform wkb to electric backgrounds with more general time dependence @xcite .",
    "the qed effective action has recently been computed @xcite as a closed form ( single integral ) expression for the particular time - dependent electric background with @xmath11 , and in this paper we consider the numerical implications of this result for pair - production rates in such a background .",
    "it is important to note that another related approach to observing pair - production is to use highly relativistic electrons as intermediate states , as has been done in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the derivative expansion ( [ derivative ] ) is an example of an _ effective field theory _",
    "expansion @xcite , such as is used in operator product expansions @xcite and chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in the effective field theory approach ,",
    "the mass @xmath12 of the electrons ( which are ` integrated out ' in the one - loop approximation ) sets an energy scale , and the physics at energies @xmath13 should be described by a low energy effective action with the formal expansion @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an operator of dimension @xmath16 . for the case of the qed effective action ,",
    "the simplest way to produce higher - derivative operators in such an expansion is to take higher powers of the field strength @xmath17 .",
    "thus , even the leading ( _ i.e. _ constant background ) term @xmath18 $ ] in the derivative expansion ( [ derivative ] ) is itself an effective field theory expansion of the form ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "this is simply the euler - heisenberg effective action which is a perturbative series expansion in powers of @xmath19 .",
    "this series is known to be divergent @xcite , and there are important physical consequences of this divergence , as we review below .",
    "another way to produce higher dimension operators in the expansion ( [ eff ] ) is to include derivatives of @xmath17 , with each derivative balanced by an inverse power of @xmath12 .",
    "this is what is done in the derivative expansion ( [ derivative ] ) .",
    "thus , we can view the derivative expansion ( [ derivative ] ) as a ` double ' series expansion , both in powers of @xmath17 and in derivatives of @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we study the divergence properties of such an expansion .",
    "it has been suggested , based on the behavior of the constant field case @xcite , that the effective field theory expansion ( [ eff ] ) is generically divergent .",
    "here we provide an explicit demonstration of this divergence for inhomogeneous background fields .    for energies well below the scale set by the fermion mass @xmath12 ,",
    "the divergent nature of the effective action is not important , as the first few terms provide an accurate approximation .",
    "however , the divergence properties do become important when the external energy scale approaches the fermion mass scale @xmath12 , and/or when the inhomogeneity scale becomes short compared to a characteristic scale of the system .",
    "the divergence is also important for understanding how the non - perturbative imaginary contributions to the effective action arise from _ real _ perturbation theory .    in section",
    "ii we review briefly the mathematical technique of borel summation , and in section iii we apply this to the euler - heisenberg - schwinger constant - background effective action .",
    "section iv gives the borel summation analysis of the particular exactly solvable cases with inhomogeneous magnetic and electric backgrounds .",
    "in section v we show how this is related to a wkb analysis , and section vi contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we review briefly the basics of borel summation @xcite .",
    "consider an asymptotic series expansion of some function @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a ( small ) dimensionless perturbation expansion parameter and the @xmath23 are real coefficients . in an extremely broad range of physics applications @xcite it has been found that perturbation theory leads not to a convergent series but to a divergent series like ( [ exp ] ) in which the expansion coefficients @xmath23 have large - order behavior of the form @xmath24 \\qquad\\qquad ( n\\to\\infty ) \\label{general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some real constants @xmath9 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 , the perturbative expansion coefficients @xmath23 alternate in sign and their magnitude grows factorially .",
    "borel summation is a particularly useful approach for this case of a divergent , but alternating series .",
    "we shall see below that non - alternating series must be treated somewhat differently .",
    "consider , for example , the asymptotic series ( [ exp ] ) with @xmath28 , and @xmath27 .",
    "this series is clearly divergent for any value of the expansion parameter @xmath29 .",
    "borel summation of this divergent series can be motivated by the following formal procedure .",
    "write @xmath30 and then formally interchange the order of summation and integration , to yield @xmath31 \\qquad\\qquad ( g\\to 0^+ ) \\label{borel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this integral is convergent for all @xmath32 , and so can be used to _ define _ the sum of the divergent series @xmath33 . to be more precise",
    ", the formula ( [ borel ] ) should be read from right to left : for @xmath34 , we can use laplace s method @xcite to make an asymptotic expansion of the integral , and we obtain the asymptotic series in ( [ exp ] ) with expansion coefficients @xmath28 .    the borel integral ( [ borel ] ) can be analytically continued off the @xmath22 axis and in this case is in fact @xcite an analytic function of @xmath29 in the cut @xmath29 plane : @xmath35 .",
    "thus , we can use a simple dispersion relation ( using the discontinuity across the cut along the negative @xmath29 axis ) to _ define _ the imaginary part of @xmath20 for negative values of the expansion parameter : @xmath36 \\qquad\\qquad ( g\\to 0^+ ) \\label{imag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note , of course , that an alternating series with negative @xmath29 is the same as a _ non - alternating _ series with positive @xmath29 .",
    "if the expansion coefficients in ( [ exp ] ) are _ non - alternating _ ( with @xmath22 ) then the situation is very different , both physically and mathematically .",
    "formal application of borel summation yields @xmath37   \\qquad\\qquad ( g\\to 0^+ ) \\label{non}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this borel integral has a pole on the integration contour",
    ". however , a principal parts prescription for such a pole gives an imaginary part in agreement with ( [ imag ] ) .",
    "this imaginary contribution is non - perturbative ( it clearly does not have an expansion in positive powers of @xmath29 ) and has important physical consequences . generically , the borel technique signals the possible presence of such non - perturbative physics if the perturbative expansion coefficients grow rapidly ( factorially ) in magnitude and are non - alternating .",
    "the associated dispersion relations provide a bridge between the perturbative physics [ i.e. the @xmath23 s ] and the non - perturbative imaginary parts [ i.e. the @xmath38 factors ] .",
    "we will see explicit examples of this below .",
    "we should note at this point that for a general divergent series these borel dispersion relations may be complicated by the appearance of additional poles and/or cuts in the complex @xmath29 plane .",
    "physically interesting poles , known as renormalons , are indeed found in certain resummations of perturbation theory for both qed and qcd @xcite . here , for the one - loop qed effective action in a fixed external background",
    "we find that we do not encounter such poles .",
    "the borel summation construction discussed above for the case @xmath28 , generalizes in the obvious way to the case where the perturbative coefficients are @xmath39 , which corresponds to the leading - order growth indicated in ( [ general ] ) : @xmath40 \\qquad\\qquad ( g\\to 0^+ ) \\label{genborel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding imaginary part for negative values of the expansion parameter is @xmath41   \\qquad\\qquad ( g\\to 0^+ ) \\label{genimag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the parameter @xmath42 affects the exponent , while the combination @xmath43 is important for the prefactor .",
    "these last two formulas , the borel integral ( [ genborel ] ) and the borel dispersion relation ( [ genimag ] ) , will be used repeatedly below .",
    "now consider applying this borel summation machinery to qed effective actions .",
    "effective actions can be expanded perturbatively in terms of the coupling constant @xmath44 , and also in terms of derivatives of the background field strength @xmath7 . to begin , we review the well - known euler - heisenberg - schwinger effective action which corresponds to a uniform background field strength ; thus the only expansion is in terms of the perturbative coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "we consider first a magnetic background , and then we consider an electric background . for a uniform background _",
    "magnetic _ field of strength @xmath45 , the exact renormalized effective action can be expressed as a ` proper - time ' integral @xcite @xmath46 the @xmath47 term is a subtraction of the zero field ( @xmath48 ) effective action , while the @xmath49 subtraction corresponds to a logarithmically divergent charge renormalization @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 factor is the space - time volume factor .",
    "it is straightforward to develop , for small @xmath51 , an asymptotic expansion of this integral : @xmath52 \\qquad\\qquad ( \\frac{eb}{m^2}\\to 0^+ ) \\label{eh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the @xmath53 are bernoulli numbers @xcite .",
    "the perturbative series ( [ eh ] ) is the euler - heisenberg @xcite perturbative expression for the qed effective action in a uniform magnetic background @xmath45 .",
    "it is an expansion in powers of the coupling @xmath44 , with the @xmath54 power of @xmath44 being associated with a one - fermion - loop diagram with @xmath16 external photon lines [ we have not included the divergent @xmath55 self - energy term as it contributes to the bare action by charge renormalization ] . note that only even powers of @xmath56 appear in the perturbative expansion ( [ eh ] ) .",
    "this is due to charge conjugation invariance ( furry s theorem ) .",
    "the expansion ( [ eh ] ) is also an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath57 , as is familiar for an effective field theory action ( [ eff ] ) , with the higher dimensional operators in the expansion simply being higher powers of @xmath58 .",
    "the euler - heisenberg perturbative effective action ( [ eh ] ) is not a convergent series .",
    "rather , it is an asymptotic series of the form ( [ exp ] ) with expansion parameter @xmath59 the expansion coefficients in ( [ eh ] ) alternate in sign [ because : @xmath60 , and grow factorially in magnitude : @xmath61 the growth of these coefficients is of the form indicated in the example in ( [ general ] ) , with @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the euler - heisenberg series ( [ eh ] ) is an example of a divergent but borel summable series .",
    "if we keep just the leading large - n behavior for the coefficients @xmath23 indicated in ( [ growth ] ) , then we can immediately read off from the borel summation formula ( [ genborel ] ) the leading - order borel approximation for the sum of the divergent series ( [ eh ] ) : @xmath64 it is straightforward to evaluate this integral numerically , and one finds approximately @xmath65 agreement with the exact answer ( [ proper ] ) even when the perturbative expansion parameter @xmath29 is as large as 50 , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "( note that ( [ growth ] ) suggests it is perhaps more ` natural ' to take the expansion parameter to be @xmath66 , so we have plotted the leading borel approximation ( [ firstborel ] ) for @xmath29 up to @xmath67 . )",
    ".5 cm    but in this case we can do much better , because we are in the unusual situation of knowing the _ exact _ perturbative expansion coefficients @xmath23 _ for all _ @xmath16 ( not simply their leading - order growth ) : @xmath68 for each @xmath69 in this sum , the coefficient is once again of the leading form in ( [ general ] ) , with @xmath70 , and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we can apply the borel summation formula ( [ genborel ] ) directly to yield @xmath71 the sum over @xmath69 gives successive corrections to the leading borel approximation in ( [ firstborel ] ) .",
    "the contributions with one , two and three terms are plotted in figure 1 , each compared to the exact result ( [ proper ] ) .",
    "note that only three terms are needed to obtain @xmath72 accuracy , even when the expansion parameter @xmath29 is as large as 50 .",
    "in fact , the expansion @xcite @xmath73 together with the fact that @xmath74 , shows that the borel integral ( [ fullborel ] ) agrees precisely with the schwinger proper - time result ( [ proper ] ) .",
    "that is , schwinger s formula ( [ proper ] ) can be viewed as the borel sum of the ( divergent ) euler - heisenberg perturbative series ( [ eh ] ) . or , in other words , the euler - heisnberg perturbative series ( [ eh ] ) can be obtained by an asymptotic expansion of schwinger s integral representation formula ( [ proper ] ) , when @xmath51 is small .    to get a sense of the size of the expansion parameter ( [ param ] ) appearing in the euler - heisenberg series",
    ", it is instructive to re - instate factors of @xmath75 and @xmath76 : @xmath77 the first equality in ( [ realparam ] ) expresses @xmath29 in terms of the square of the ratio of the cyclotron energy @xmath78 to the electron rest mass energy @xmath79 , while the second equality expresses it in terms of the fourth power of the ratio of the electron compton wavelength @xmath80 to the `` magnetic length '' scale @xmath81 set by the magnetic field . the critical magnetic field strength at which the dimensionless parameter @xmath29 in ( [ realparam ] ) is order 1 is @xmath82 gauss .",
    "this is well above currently available laboratory static magnetic field strengths , which are approximately @xmath83 gauss , in which case @xmath84 is _ extremely _ small .",
    "however , the critical field @xmath85 is comparable to the scale of magnetic field strengths observed in astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars which can have magnetic fields of the order of @xmath86 gauss @xcite .    now consider the euler - heisenberg - schwinger effective action in a uniform background _ electric _ field of strength @xmath87 , instead of the uniform magnetic background @xmath45 .",
    "perturbatively , the only difference is that @xmath58 is replaced by @xmath88 , which amounts to changing the sign of the expansion parameter @xmath29 in ( [ param ] ) .",
    "therefore , in a uniform electric background , the euler - heisenberg perturbative effective action ( [ eh ] ) becomes a _",
    "non - alternating _",
    "series @xmath89 ( recall that @xmath90 , so @xmath91 is non - alternating . )",
    "this series is clearly divergent and since the coefficients are non - alternating , it is not borel summable . nevertheless ,",
    "using the borel dispersion relations we can extract the imaginary part of the effective action . if we keep just the leading large-@xmath16 growth ( [ growth ] ) of the expansion coefficients , then we can immediately read off from the borel dispersion relation result ( [ genimag ] ) the leading behavior of the imaginary part of the effective action in the electric background : @xmath92 \\qquad\\qquad ( \\frac{ee}{m^2}\\to 0^+ ) \\label{leadingimag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this imaginary part has direct physical significance - it gives half the electron - positron pair production rate in the uniform electric field @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "actually , as in the magnetic case , we can do better than just the leading behavior ( [ leadingimag ] ) . combining the expansion coefficients ( [ zeta ] ) with the borel dispersion formula ( [ genimag ] )",

    "this is a very small number , so the exponential factors in ( [ leadingimag ] ) and ( [ fullimag ] ) are extremely small .",
    "the critical electric field at which the non - perturbative factors become significant is @xmath96 .",
    "this is still several orders of magnitude beyond the field obtainable in current lasers @xcite .    to conclude this section ,",
    "we stress that this constant - field case provides an explicit example of dyson s argument @xcite that qed perturbation theory can not be convergent as a series in the fine structure constant @xmath97 , because this would mean that the stable vacuum , with @xmath9 positive , is smoothly connected to the unstable vacuum , with @xmath9 negative , at least in a small neighborhood of the origin .",
    "the perturbative euler - heisenberg series in ( [ eh ] ) and ( [ ehe ] ) are expansions in powers of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . changing from a magnetic background to an electric background",
    "involves replacing @xmath100 with @xmath101 , which amounts to changing the sign of @xmath102 ( i.e. , the fine structure constant ) , since @xmath44 always appears as @xmath56 or @xmath103 .",
    "if the euler - heisenberg perturbative series were convergent , then the change from @xmath100 to @xmath101 would not produce any non - perturbative imaginary part in the effective action .",
    "thus there would be no pair production and we would miss the genuine physical instability of the qed vacuum in an external electric field .",
    "hence the euler - heisenberg perturbative series _ can not _ be convergent .",
    "so far , we have re - phrased well - known qed results in the language of borel summation .",
    "now we turn to the main point of this paper , which is to go beyond the euler - heisenberg - schwinger constant field results for the qed effective action .",
    "perturbatively , this leads to a derivative expansion ( [ derivative ] ) which is a formal expansion in increasing numbers of derivatives of the background field strength @xmath104 + s^{(2)}[f_{\\mu\\nu},\\partial_\\mu f_{\\nu\\rho}]+ \\dots \\label{der}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 involves no derivatives of the background field strength @xmath7 , while the first correction @xmath106 involves two derivatives of the field strength , and so on .",
    "the increasing powers of derivatives are balanced by increasing powers of @xmath107 .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to say anything precise about the convergence or divergence of such a derivative expansion because it is not an actual series , as in ( [ exp ] ) , in terms of a dimensionless expansion parameter . for a general background",
    "there is a rapid proliferation of the number of independent terms with a given number of derivatives of the field strength ( see @xcite for the first order and @xcite for higher orders ) .",
    "even a first order derivative expansion calculation is quite non - trivial .",
    "moreover , for a general background field , it is extremely difficult to estimate and compare the magnitude of the various terms in the derivative expansion ( [ der ] ) .",
    "so a perturbative analysis to high orders in a derivative expansion appears prohibitively difficult for a general background field strength .",
    "this makes it difficult to reconcile a perturbative derivative expansion calculation with the calculation of the non - perturbative imaginary part of the effective action for an electric background .",
    "we explore this question below .    as a first step towards overcoming these obstacles , we can consider restricted classes of special backgrounds for which the derivative expansion reduces to a manageable form .",
    "the qed effective action has recently been computed _ exactly _ for either ( not both ) of the following special inhomogeneous background magnetic @xcite and electric fields @xcite : @xmath108 it has of course long been known that the dirac equation is exactly solvable for such backgrounds , a fact that has permitted many authors to study the qed effective action in these backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the new feature of @xcite is that all the momentum traces have been performed so that the effective action is expressed as a simple integral representation [ involving a _",
    "integral ] , as in schwinger s classic result ( [ proper ] ) for the uniform background field .",
    "this then permits the expansion of the effective action as a true series , whose convergence / divergence properties can be studied in detail .    on the right side of ( [ inhom ] ) , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are constant vectors .",
    "thus , @xmath111 points in a fixed direction in space and is static , but its magnitude varies in the @xmath112 direction , with a characteristic length scale @xmath113 that is arbitrary .",
    "similarly , @xmath114 points in a fixed direction in space and is spatially uniform , but its magnitude varies in time , with a characteristic time scale @xmath115 that is arbitrary .",
    "these electric and magnetic fields satisfy the homogeneous maxwell equations , but not the inhomogeneous ones , so classically we should think of them as being supported by external currents . within a quantum path integral they simply correspond to some particular vector potential @xmath116 .",
    "note that in the limits @xmath117 and @xmath118 we regain the uniform field cases relevant for the euler - heisenberg - schwinger effective action .",
    "we therefore expect that , for the inhomogeneous backgrounds ( [ inhom ] ) , the derivative expansion of the effective action should correspond to an expansion for large @xmath113 and large @xmath115 .",
    "we concentrate first on the magnetic field case , and then use a duality transformation @xmath0 to convert to the electric field case .    since each derivative of the magnetic field in ( [ inhom ] )",
    "produces a factor of @xmath119 , a natural dimensionless expansion parameter for the derivative expansion in the magnetic case is ( restoring factors of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) @xmath120 this dimensionless parameter is the square of the ratio of the magnetic length scale @xmath81 ( which is set by the peak magnetic field magnitude @xmath121 ) to @xmath113 , the length scale of the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , we can combine this with the dimensionless perturbation parameter ( [ realparam ] ) of the constant field case , to obtain another dimensionless expansion parameter @xmath122 which is essentially ( up to factors of @xmath123 ) the square of the ratio of the compton wavelength of the electron to the inhomogeneity scale @xmath113 .",
    "thus , for a magenetic background with a macroscopic inhomogeneity scale @xmath113 , the ratio @xmath124 is extremely small . in this form",
    ", we clearly recognize the derivative expansion as an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath57 , as in a general effective field theory expansion ( [ eff ] ) .    indeed , these expectations are borne out by the exact renormalized effective action @xcite , which has the double perturbative expansion ( we set @xmath76 and @xmath75 to 1 again ) @xmath125 in ( [ exact ] ) it is understood that the double sum excludes the @xmath126 term , as this term contributes to the logarithmically divergent charge renormalization of the bare action @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the summation indexed by @xmath127 in ( [ exact ] ) corresponds precisely to the orders of the derivative expansion .",
    "this has been verified @xcite by comparison with independent derivative expansion calculations of the leading and first - correction term , computations that were done using the proper - time method @xcite .",
    "for example , to make the comparison with the leading term of the derivative expansion we simply take the euler - heisenberg constant field answer ( [ eh ] ) , replace @xmath45 by @xmath128 and do the @xmath112 integrals , using the fact that @xmath129 .",
    "this reproduces the @xmath130 term in ( [ exact ] ) . a similar argument @xcite holds for the first correction term in the derivative expansion , which reproduces the @xmath131 term in ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the perturbative expression ( [ exact ] ) for the effective action is an explicit double sum ( with no remaining integrals ) in terms of two dimensionless parameters .",
    "one parameter @xmath51 characterizes the perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling @xmath44 , while the other parameter @xmath124 characterizes the derivative expansion .",
    "moreover , all the expansion coefficients are known exactly .",
    "thus , we can apply to this effective action the standard techniques for the analysis of divergent series ( such as borel summation ) .      consider a fixed order @xmath127 of the derivative expansion .",
    "this still involves a perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling @xmath44 . for @xmath130 , from ( [ exact ] )",
    "we see that the perturbative expansion in the magnetic case is @xmath132 the expansion coefficients alternate in sign and grow factorially with @xmath69 : @xmath133 \\qquad\\qquad , k\\to \\infty \\label{bgrowth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we are in the situation described by ( [ general ] ) .",
    "therefore , this leading order ( @xmath130 ) in the derivative expansion is a divergent but borel summable series [ this is hardly surprising , as we already showed in the previous section that the euler - heisenberg effective action is itself a divergent but borel summable series ] . applying the borel summation formula ( [ genborel ] ) , the leading borel approximation for the series ( [ bzero ] ) is @xmath134 \\qquad\\qquad   ( \\frac{eb}{m^2}\\to 0^+ ) \\label{bzb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is instructive to compare this with the leading borel approximation ( [ firstborel ] ) to the effective action for a _ uniform _ magnetic background @xmath45 . to make this comparison we replace",
    "the uniform background @xmath45 in ( [ firstborel ] ) with the inhomogeneous background @xmath135 , and then perform the @xmath112 integration .",

    "the resummation of leading borel approximations in ( [ presum ] ) gives corrections to this leading exponent @xmath197 \\label{bc2}\\ ] ] where in the perturbative regime the parameter @xmath198 is small .",
    "now ask the question : how does the time dependence of the inhomogeneous electric background in ( [ inhom ] ) modify schwinger s constant field result ( [ leadingimag ] ) ?",
    "the answer depends critically on how the characteristic time scale @xmath115 of the inhomogeneity relates to the time scale @xmath199 set by the peak electric field @xmath87 .",
    "this then determines [ see ( [ gov ] ) ] the relative magintude of the two expansion parameters @xmath185 ( corresponding to the derivative expansion ) and @xmath145 ( corresponding to the perturbative expansion ) .    in the non - perturbative regime , the smaller of the two parameters is the derivative expansion parameter : @xmath200 .",

    "this is exactly what was done in deriving the result ( [ presum ] ) .",
    "note that , in each case , our ability to treat the remaining sum _ exactly _ relied on the fact that the leading borel approximations came out in a form that could be exponentiated .",
    "it is not a priori obvious that this dramatic simplification had to occur .",
    "however , in the next section we will see that this exponentiation is very natural in terms of a wkb formulation .",
    "in a general background , @xmath204 , the effective action is too complicated to permit such a detailed borel analysis as has been done in the previous sections for the uniform background and for the special inhomogeneous backgrounds in ( [ inhom ] ) .",
    "clearly , we do not know the spectrum of the dirac operator for a general background , so some sort of approximate expansion method , such as the derivative expansion , is required .",
    "but the formal derivative expansion ( [ der ] ) is not a series expansion , because more and more ( independent ) tensor structures appear with each new order of the derivative expansion .",
    "this is because with more derivatives there are more indices to be contracted in various ways .",
    "another way of saying this is that the inhomogeneity of a general background can not be characterized by a single ( or even a finite number of ) scale parameter(s ) , such as the length scale @xmath113 or the time scale @xmath115 in ( [ inhom ] ) .",
    "another problem is that in general it is difficult to estimate the size of various terms in such a derivative expansion when the background field strength @xmath7 is an arbitrary function of space - time .",
    "so , even if we could organize the derivative expansion into a sensible series , it would be difficult to estimate the magnitude of the coefficients at very high orders in the series , as is needed for a borel analysis .    nevertheless , it is still instructive to consider a further generalization of the particular inhomogeneous backrounds in ( [ inhom ] ) . in this section",
    "we relax the condition that we know the exact spectrum of the dirac operator , but keep the restriction that the backgrounds only depend on one space - time coordinate .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the spectral problem to that of an ordinary differential operator .",
    "as is clear from ( [ action ] ) , the effective action is determined by the spectrum of the operator @xmath205 { \\bf 1 } + \\frac{e}{2}f_{\\mu\\nu } \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } \\label{op}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 $ ] . if we restrict our attention to inhomogeneous backgrounds that point in a fixed direction in space ( say , the @xmath140 direction ) and depend on just one space - time coordinate , then the operator in ( [ op ] ) can be diagonalized with a suitable gauge choice and a suitable dirac basis .",
    "for example , the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath207 can be realized with the vector potential @xmath208 .",
    "then , in the standard dirac representation @xcite for the gamma matrices , the operator @xmath209 is diagonal , with diagonal entries ( appearing twice each on the diagonal ) : @xmath210    similarly , the time - dependent electric field @xmath211 can be realized with the vector potential @xmath212 .",
    "then , in the standard chiral representation @xcite for the gamma matrices , the operator @xmath209 is diagonal , with diagonal entries ( appearing twice each on the diagonal ) : @xmath213    therefore , in each case ( [ genb ] ) and ( [ gene ] ) , the spectrum is determined by a one - dimensional ordinary differential operator .",
    "however , note the appearance of the factors of @xmath214 in the electric case ( [ ediag ] ) .",
    "this shows immediately the fundamental difference between a magnetic background and an electric background . in the magnetic case , the eigenvalues of the associated ordinary differential operator are real , while for the electric case , the eigenvalues of the associated ordinary differential operator have an imaginary part .",
    "( note that in the magnetic case the boundary condition for the ordinary differential operator is for solutions that decay at @xmath215 , while in the electric case we seek solutions going like @xmath216 at @xmath217 , corresponding to the particle / antiparticle pair @xcite .",
    "the reader is encouraged to check all this explicitly for the simple case of a uniform background . )",
    "schwinger s uniform field case corresponds to choosing the function @xmath218 appearing in ( [ genb ] ) and ( [ gene ] ) to be @xmath219 , while the inhomogeneous backgrounds in ( [ inhom ] ) correspond to choosing @xmath220 .",
    "it is well known that in each case the spectrum of the associated ordinary differential operator in ( [ bdiag ] ) and ( [ ediag ] ) is exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "this explains why it is possible to compute the effective action exactly for these backgrounds . for the more general fields in ( [ genb ] ) and ( [ gene ] )",
    "it is not possible to find the exact spectrum .",
    "however , we can still use a wkb approach to approximate the spectrum . for a time - dependent , but spatially uniform , electric background this leads to the following wkb expression for the imaginary part of the effective action @xcite @xmath221 where the wkb exponent is @xmath222 here @xmath223 and @xmath224 for the electric field in ( [ gene ] ) .",
    "the integration in ( [ omega ] ) is between the turning points of the integrand [ this expression is somewhat symbolic - in practice , the evaluation of @xmath225 requires careful phase choices , depending on the form of the function @xmath226 @xcite ] . for the constant field case , with @xmath219 ,",
    "one finds @xmath227 then the momentum integrals in ( [ wkb ] ) can be done [ recall the density of states integral : @xmath228 to yield the familiar schwinger result ( [ fullimag ] ) .    in the inhomogeneous electric field",
    "@xmath141 , which corresponds to @xmath220 , we can also compute @xmath225 exactly @xcite : @xmath229 it is a straightforward , but somewhat messy , computation to check that by doing the momentum integrals in ( [ wkb ] ) with this expression for @xmath225 , one arrives at the exact integral representation , derived in @xcite , for the effective action in this inhomogeneous background .",
    "the wkb expression gives the _ exact _ result in this case because the uniform wkb approximation gives the exact spectrum of the differential operators ( [ bdiag ] ) and ( [ ediag ] ) when @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "now consider this wkb exponent @xmath225 in ( [ exactomega ] ) in the non - perturbative and perturbative limits ( [ regimes ] ) . in the non - perturbative limit we can expand @xmath225 in inverse powers of @xmath44 as @xmath230 \\label{long}\\ ] ] in the perturbative limit ,",

    "this effectively replaces @xmath234 with @xmath12 in ( [ long ] ) and ( [ short ] ) , and the @xmath235 integrals in ( [ wkb ] ) contribute to the prefactor . then comparing ( [ long ] ) and ( [ short ] ) with ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) , we see that we regain exactly the borel resummed results ( [ eresum ] ) and ( [ presum ] ) obtained for the two extreme limits ( [ regimes ] ) .",
    "thus , this wkb analysis explains why we found two different expressions , ( [ eresum ] ) and ( [ presum ] ) , by borel resummation of the double series ( [ exact ] ) , depending on the relative size of the two dimensionless expansion parameters .    to conclude this discussion of the wkb approach , it is instructive to compare the @xmath11 case with the case of an oscillating electric field @xmath236 which was studied in detail using wkb methods by brzin and itzykson @xcite .",

    "the wkb pair production rate for an oscillating time - dependent electric background becomes @xcite @xmath244 this is a perturbative expression , with the perturbative parameter @xmath245 raised to a power @xmath246 which is the number of photons of frequency @xmath247 required to match the pair creation energy @xmath248 .",
    "so , while the non - perturbative results ( [ long ] ) and ( [ wkblow ] ) are very similar for the cases @xmath249 and @xmath250 respectively , the corresponding perturbative results are very different from one another for these two time - dependent electric backgrounds .",
    "this difference can be traced to the different perturbative limits ( [ short ] ) and ( [ wkbhigh ] ) of the wkb exponent @xmath225 .",
    "physically , this is not so surprising if we recall that the perturbative limits , @xmath193 and @xmath251 , can also be thought of as short - pulse and high - frequency limits ( respectively ) , in which case the @xmath252 and @xmath253 profiles of the electric background are significantly different .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the qed effective action is a divergent double series for the inhomogeneous magnetic background @xmath254 and for the inhomogeneous electric background @xmath249 .",
    "in particular , we have also demonstrated that for these inhomogeneous background fields the derivative expansion is itself divergent .",
    "borel summation techniques have been used to relate the rate of divergence to the non - perturbative imaginary part of the effective action , which determines the pair - production rate in the time - dependent electric background . remarkably , the leading borel approximations exponentiate to yield corrections to the familiar exponent appearing in the constant field case .",
    "these resummations can also be explained using a wkb analysis of the imaginary part of the effective action .    finally , we conclude by considering the question of borel summability of the perturbative effective action when the inhomogeneous background has the more general form in ( [ genb ] ) or ( [ gene ] ) . the exponential form of the wkb expression ( [ wkb ] ) for the imaginary part of the effective action is very suggestive of the exponential imaginary parts found from the borel dispersion relation ( [ genimag ] ) . indeed , writing @xmath255 we can read the borel dispersion relation backwards [ with @xmath256 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 to obtain the corresponding asymptotic expansion of the real part of the effective action @xmath259 where in the magnetic case @xmath260 .",
    "this expression is consistent with the result from the resolvent method ( although to be strictly correct we need to specify carefully phase conventions for @xmath225 @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the constant magnetic case @xmath261 , and it is easy to verify [ recalling that @xmath262 that the expansion ( [ back ] ) reproduces the euler - heisenberg expansion ( [ eh ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the expansion ( [ back ] ) is a reorganization of the usual perturbative expansion of the effective action , and this reorganized form already makes manifest the generic divergence properties of the effective action , since the bernoulli numbers have leading behavior @xmath263 .",
    "thus , we see that in the magnetic case the expansion ( [ back ] ) has coefficients that alternate in sign and grow factorially in magnitude . in this formal sense , the divergence properties of the effective action discussed in this paper , for the special cases with @xmath264 and @xmath265 , appear to extend to more general backgrounds . however , we caution that this argument is formal , as it neglects the possible appearance of other poles and/or cuts in the borel plane which might invalidate the naive use of the borel dispersion relation ( [ genimag ] )",
    ". nevertheless , it is suggestive to associate the non - perturbative wkb expression ( [ wkb ] ) for the imaginary part of the effective action with the divergent expansion ( [ back ] ) for the real part .",
