    "most non - standard properties of neutrinos arise from non - zero masses @xcite . among these electro - magnetic dipole moments",
    "play an important role @xcite . here",
    "we are concerned with a particular effect in neutrino - electron scattering for neutrinos from the sun which possess a dirac magnetic moment @xcite or transition magnetic moments @xcite in the case of majorana neutrinos .",
    "the latter is especially interesting first of all because it is more fundamental theoretically , and because majorana neutrinos are the ones which arise in most extensions of the standard model .",
    "moreover , the effects of majorana transition moments can be resonantly enhanced when neutrinos propagate in media @xcite such as the sun , providing one of the attractive solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "another practical advantage in favour of majorana transition moments is that , in contrast to dirac - type magnetic moments , these are substantially less stringently constrained by astrophysics @xcite .    for _ pure left - handed neutrinos _ the weak interaction and the electro - magnetic interaction amplitudes on electrons do not interfere , since the weak interaction preserves neutrino helicity while the electro - magnetic does not . as a result",
    "the cross section depends quadratically on @xmath0",
    ".    however , if there exists a process capable of converting part of the initially fully polarized @xmath1 s , then an _ interference term _ arises , proportional to @xmath0 , as pointed out e.g. in ref .",
    "this term depends on the angle between the component of the neutrino spin transverse to its momentum and the momentum of the outgoing recoil electron .",
    "therefore the event count rates expected in an experiment would exhibit an _ asymmetry _ with respect to the above defined angle .",
    "such asymmetry would not show up in earth - bound laboratory experiments even with stronger magnetic fields , since the helicity - flip could be caused only by the presence of a neutrino mass and is therefore negligible @xcite .",
    "however , in the solar convective zone one may find a magnetic field extended over a tenth or so of the solar radius and , most importantly , the neutrino depolarization could be resonant in the sun . even if the sun possesses only a relatively modest large - scale magnetic field @xmath2 g in the convective region ( @xmath3 cm ) , and for a neutrino magnetic moment of the order @xmath4 such a spin - flip process may take place with sizeable rates , since in such a case one has @xmath5 .",
    "barbieri and fiorentini considered @xcite the conversions @xmath6 in the sun as a result of the spin - flip by a toroidal magnetic field in the convective zone .",
    "they showed that the azimuthal asymmetry could be observable in a real time solar @xmath7b - neutrino experiment and as large as 20% for an electron kinetic energy threshold of @xmath8 mev .",
    "they chose a fixed @xmath1 survival probability @xmath9 ( as suggested at that time by the homestake experiment ) and the maximal dirac magnetic moment allowed by laboratory experiments , @xmath10 .    on the other hand , vogel and",
    "engel @xcite emphasized that if an asymmetry in the scattering of solar neutrinos exists , recoil electrons will be emitted copiously along the direction of the neutrino polarization in the plane orthogonal to the neutrino momentum .",
    "they calculated the asymmetry expected for solar @xmath7b neutrinos with @xmath11 and concluded that it would be difficult to detect because of the poor angular resolution of the experiments .",
    "moreover , as we will see later , both @xcite and @xcite _ overestimated _ the asymmetry .",
    "thus their calculations are not accurate .",
    "in this paper we correct results for the asymmetry in the case presented by @xcite and @xcite for high energy @xmath7b neutrinos .",
    "in addition we compare them with the expected asymmetry in the case of a majorana transition magnetic moment of the same magnitude .",
    "more importantly , we show the sensitivity of planned solar neutrino experiments in the _ low energy region _ ( @xmath12 mev ) to the azimuthal asymmetries that are expected in the recoil electron event rates , arising from the above electro - weak interference term .",
    "we calculate the asymmetry for the low - energy @xmath13-neutrinos fixing the survival probability at @xmath14 .",
    "this gives the maximum expected asymmetry and seems phenomenologically reasonable in order to convert the initial solar @xmath15 s via the resonant spin - flavour precession ( rsfp ) scenario .",
    "in particular we calculate the asymmetry that could be observed in the azimuthal distribution of events in an experiment like the proposed hellaz @xcite , sensitive to the fundamental @xmath13 neutrinos from the sun . the multi - wire - chamber in hellaz should measure both the recoil electron energy @xmath16 and the recoil electron scattering angle @xmath17 with good precision",
    ". moreover hellaz should be sensitive to the azimuthal angle @xmath18 , measuring the number of events in @xmath18bins .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the hellaz experiment for probing @xmath0 and compare it with planned accelerator experiments .",
    "in particular there are very interesting new projects , such as the future itep - minnesota experiment , where they plan to search @xmath19 down to @xmath20 with reactor anti - neutrinos @xcite , and the lama experiment , which will use a powerful isotope neutrino source @xcite .",
    "finally , we also refine our calculations of the azimuthal asymmetry expected for @xmath13 neutrinos at hellaz using a realistic energy - dependent conversion probability @xmath21 based on a simple model for resonant spin flip conversions in the sun .",
    "we consider the neutrino ",
    "electron scattering process @xmath22 when the initial flux of neutrinos is not completely polarized , as a result of conversions induced by non - zero transition magnetic moments in the sun .",
    "in other words , our flux is a mixture of both the original left - handed solar neutrinos with the converted ones ( right - handed ) .",
    "we consider both conventional dirac - type magnetic moments as well as majorana transition moments .",
    "the differential cross section can be written as a sum of three terms , ( for details , see for instance @xcite ) @xmath23 where @xmath16 is the recoil energy of electrons and @xmath18 the azimuthal angle defined in figure [ axis ] .",
    "let us first assume that only the dirac @xmath1 magnetic moment exists , @xmath24 . for ultra - relativistic neutrinos",
    "the expressions for the weak and electro - magnetic terms are the following @xmath25 \\label{weakdirac1}\\ ] ] @xmath26~. \\label{em}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the survival probability of the initial @xmath15 , @xmath27 is the incoming neutrino energy , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the constants of the standard model with @xmath30 .    in such a case",
    "there is an _ interference term _ proportional to @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 \\vec{\\xi}_\\perp    \\label{add}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the transverse component of the neutrino polarization spin vector with respect to its momentum .",
    "it is a function of the @xmath15 survival probability , @xmath34 .",
    "this interference term depends on the angle between @xmath33 and the momentum of the outgoing electron @xmath35 .",
    "may be written as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath18 ( as defined in figure [ axis ] ) using @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the maximum electron recoil energy .",
    "let us explain here why the results of @xcite and @xcite for dirac neutrinos are not correct .",
    "first , the weak term in eq .",
    "( 11a ) of barbieri & fiorentini is a factor 2 less than our , while the interference term coincides with ours . on",
    "the other hand vogel & engel used an interference term ( their eq .",
    "( a9 ) ) which is a factor 2 bigger than our .",
    "thus both overestimated the asymmetry by an approximate factor two .",
    "this also agrees with a recent calculation in reference @xcite .    if neutrinos are majorana particles they can only possess a transition magnetic moment @xmath38 .",
    "for simplicity we assume the case of cp conservation . for definiteness , moreover , we consider the case of two neutrino species , @xmath1 and @xmath39 , with positive relative cp - parity @xcite .",
    "the three terms of the differential cross section will include an electro - magnetic term ( same as with @xmath40 ) , a weak term , @xmath41 + \\ ] ] @xmath42\\biggr \\}~ , \\label{weak1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , and an interference term @xmath44 where we have defined @xmath45 \\vec{\\xi}_\\perp^{~e \\bar{\\mu } } \\label{amaj}\\ ] ] here the mixed polarization vector is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 conversion probability .",
    "the relevant quantity to be measured in neutrino - electron scattering experiments capable of measuring directionality of the outgoing @xmath49 ( like hellaz ) is the event number azimuthal distribution , namely @xmath50 where @xmath51 is given in , @xmath52 is the efficiency of the detector ( which we take as unity for energies above the threshold , for simplicity ) , and @xmath53 is the number of electrons in the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "the sum in the above equation is done over the solar neutrino spectrum , where @xmath54 corresponds to the different reactions @xmath55 , @xmath56be , @xmath57 , @xmath7b @xmath58 , characterized by a differential spectrum @xmath59 and an integral flux @xmath60 .    in the previous section we found that the azimuthal distribution of the number of events can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) accounts for the weak ( electro - magnetic ) contributions , while @xmath64 is the interference term .",
    "the differential azimuthal asymmetry is defined as @xmath65 where @xmath18 ( @xmath66 ) is measured with respect to the direction of the magnetic field @xmath67 , which we will assume to be along the positive @xmath68-axis ( see fig .  [ axis ] ) .",
    "one can also define an integrated ( over @xmath18 ) asymmetry @xmath69 where @xmath70 @xmath71 and then one gets @xmath72 which is directly related to the differential asymmetry by @xmath73 let us define the maximum integrated asymmetry measurable by the experiment , @xmath74 then @xmath75 where @xmath76 is manifestly positive .",
    "it is important to emphasize that hellaz will be the first experiment which is potentially sensitive to azimuthal asymmetries since the directionality of the outgoing @xmath49 can be measured .",
    "the angular resolution is expected to be @xmath77 mrad @xmath78 , substantially better than that of super - kamiokande .",
    "notice also that the width of the cerenkov cone defined by the angle @xmath17 is very narrow for high - energy boron neutrinos , as one can see from .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath13 neutrino energies accessible at hellaz ( @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 mev ) we estimate that @xmath17 can be as large as @xmath81 .",
    "let us now discuss how the measurement of the azimuthal asymmetry could be carried out considering that @xmath67 is constant over a given period of time but its direction is unknown .",
    "one should collect events in every @xmath18-bin , where @xmath18 is defined with respect to some arbitrarily chosen axis , and then take for different @xmath82 the ratio @xmath83 which should show a @xmath84 dependence with a maximum equal to @xmath76 .",
    "this maximum will show us the angle @xmath85 which corresponds to the direction of @xmath67 ( @xmath86 if @xmath67 goes along the positive x axis ) .",
    "then the direction of @xmath67 is measured together with @xmath76 .",
    "since this direction may change in time the experiment should accumulate events until the maximum @xmath87-like correlation in @xmath88 is found and then start a new event counting period when such correlation goes away due to the changing direction of @xmath67 .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath76 could be extracted by performing a series of such measurements .",
    "we have calculated the maximal integrated azimuthal asymmetry @xmath76 for the case of @xmath7b neutrinos , i.e. for the situation described in references @xcite and @xcite . in order to do this",
    "we have made use of the corresponding differential @xmath7b neutrino spectrum in the standard solar model @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ asimhigh ] .",
    "one can see that the asymmetry in the dirac diagonal case ( @xmath89 ) is in fact approximately a factor two smaller than predicted by barbieri & fiorentini .",
    "the asymmetry in the majorana case ( @xmath90 ) for the equivalent @xmath91 value is , as expected , smaller since there are two active species in the neutrino flux so that the weak term ( which enters in the denominator in ) becomes larger .",
    "figure [ asimlow ] shows the results obtained by a similar analysis for the case of @xmath13-neutrinos , again taking into account the theoretically predicted differential @xmath13 neutrino spectrum and a more realistic value of the survival probability for the rsfp scenario in the sun ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "searching for such an asymmetry would be quite an interesting physics task in an hellaz - like experiment .",
    "the dependence of @xmath76 on the value of the magnetic moment deserves a more detailed analysis .",
    "one can write @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 is maximized for @xmath96 , e.g. when the pure weak term is equal to the electro - magnetic contribution .",
    "this fact favours @xmath13-neutrinos with respect to high energy neutrinos , since such a maximum is reached for lower @xmath97 values precisely due to the lower energies considered .",
    "in fact , for an energy threshold of recoil electrons @xmath98 mev ( reachable at hellaz ) the maximal asymmetry is reached for @xmath99 in contrast to boron neutrinos , for which the maximal asymmetry is reached for @xmath100 .",
    "this way one sees that figs .",
    "[ asimhigh ] and [ asimlow ] describe approximately the most favourable situation for measuring @xmath76 ( see also figure [ asimmu ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath101 is reached when the number of weak events is equal to the number of electro - magnetic events seems to suggest that the measurement of the total number of events @xmath102 would be enough to rule out the values of @xmath97 to which the asymmetry is sensitive .",
    "however , it is not so if one bears in mind that :    1 .",
    "background events from other processes always increase the total number of events .",
    "thus one needs to perform a good subtraction of background events to get some information on the @xmath97 term . on the other hand , assuming that the background is isotropic in the azimuthal plane , it should not be present in the numerator of @xmath76 and then if some asymmetry is measured one can be confident that it is due to a neutrino magnetic moment ; 2 .   the asymmetry is a ratio of event numbers .",
    "thus global normalization uncertainties ( e.g. in the total neutrino fluxes ) completely drop out from the asymmetry . on the other hand energy - dependent uncertainties ( in the neutrino spectrum or detection efficiencies )",
    "will be reduced since the same integrations appear in the numerator and in the denominator ;    last , but not least , if resonant spin flavour precessions really take place , one can not use the standard weak cross section and subtract it in order to get information on @xmath97 ; the signal becomes then uncertain since the `` weak background '' becomes unknown .    for all these reasons",
    "the asymmetry measurement is preferred .",
    "it suffers , of course from the dependence on the magnetic field direction , which is unknown .",
    "however , sensitivity to that information is also of potential astrophysical interest .",
    "we now consider how the above results are affected by the energy dependence expected in the conversion probability in the rsfp scenario .",
    "the general evolution hamiltonian characterizing the system of two majorana neutrinos with a non - zero transition moment is four - dimensional @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we illustrate the energy dependence of the conversion probability in the simplest realization of the rsfp scenario @xcite where vacuum mixing is neglected . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath103 and the conversion probability @xmath104 is given analytically as ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the effective neutrino mixing angle in matter @xmath107 where @xmath38 denotes the transition magnetic moment , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) is the effective potential of the neutrinos in the medium that arises due to charged ( neutral ) current interactions . on the other hand @xmath111 is the landau - zener transition probability , @xmath112 from analyses of experimental data and different models of the solar magnetic field @xcite , one finds that the data are well reproduced for @xmath113 ev@xmath114 , with a maximum @xmath115 strength of @xmath116 kg , assuming @xmath117 .    for low - energy solar neutrinos , such as @xmath13 neutrinos",
    ", the conversion in corresponds to the non - adiabatic regime @xmath118 , so that @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ pwithe ] we show our results for the azimuthal asymmetry of events when the conversion probability depends on the neutrino energy as in .",
    "we present three choices of @xmath120 values that lead to a conversion probability of the order of 40 - 60% .",
    "the case of constant @xmath14 is shown for comparison .",
    "one can see from the figure that the dependence of @xmath21 on the neutrino energy leads to somewhat smaller azimuthal asymmetries , but qualitatively very similar to those obtained in the previous case , where the energy dependence was neglected .",
    "there is basically a compensation of the effect when integrating over energies with the @xmath121 spectrum , in such a way that this dependence is smoothed .",
    "measuring azimuthal asymmetries in future low - energy solar neutrino - electron scattering experiments with good angular resolution should be a feasible and illuminating task .",
    "such asymmetries should provide useful information on non - standard neutrino properties such as magnetic moments , as well as on solar magnetic fields .",
    "the effect follows from an interference of electro - magnetic and weak amplitudes in the cross section .",
    "we have seen that low - energy experiments such as hellaz ( sensitive mainly to pp neutrinos ) should provide a much better means for the study of azimuthal asymmetries than accessible at the kamiokande or super - kamiokande experiments ( sensitive to boron neutrinos ) . for equal values of the magnetic moments ,",
    "the expected asymmetries are larger for dirac neutrinos than for majorana neutrino transition moments . however , the dirac neutrino case is probably less likely , as there is no resonant conversion in the sun .",
    "one exception would be the case of dirac neutrinos in the presence of twisting magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , although in this case resonant conversions in matter can take place one expects ( as mentioned in section 3 ) a washing out of the asymmetry effect due to the changing magnetic field direction .",
    "therefore the rsfp scenario remains as the most promising possibility .",
    "it is also the most interesting one theoretically , since majorana neutrinos are more fundamental and arise in most models of particle physics beyond the standard model .",
    "note that the discussion given above we have assumed @xmath1 magnetic moments of the order @xmath122 which is consistent with present laboratory experiments .",
    "apart from possible effects in red giants , a @xmath1 transition moment of @xmath122 is compatible with astrophysical limits , given the present uncertainties in these considerations .",
