    "orthogonal arrays are known to be universally optimal for estimating certain statistical models . however , for a given @xmath6 combination finding an oa(@xmath6 ) or proving that it does not exist is a notoriously difficult problem .",
    "two orthogonal arrays are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by permuting factors or runs as well as permuting levels in a subset of factors .",
    "bulutoglu and margot [ 1 ] enumerated all non - isomorphic orthogonal arrays for many @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath4 combinations .",
    "their enumeration was based on finding all non - isomorphic , non - negative integer solutions to a system of equations with binary coefficients , where each variable represents the number of times a factor level combination occurs in the sought after orthogonal array and each solution corresponds to an orthogonal array . to find all such solutions",
    ", they used the integer programming solver with isomorphism pruning developed by margot [ 3 ] .",
    "they declared two solutions to be isomorphic if one could be obtained from the other by applying a permutation belonging to the automorphism group of the constraint matrix . in each enumeration in [ 1 ] , the margot [ 3 ] integer programming solver used this automorphism group .    for a @xmath2 factor , @xmath9 level design @xmath0 , bulutoglu and margot [ 1 ]",

    "bulutoglu and margot [ 1 ] showed that the @xmath10 of an @xmath14 is a subgroup of the automorphism group @xmath15 of the constraint matrix defining orthogonal arrays with the same parameters .",
    "they also observed that @xmath16 for each @xmath14 they enumerated . in this paper , @xmath16 unless @xmath17 or @xmath18 is shown .",
    "furthermore , all the permutation symmetries in the linear programming ( lp ) relaxation of the orthogonal array problem are given .",

    "the group @xmath34 consisting of all the permutation symmetries of @xmath33 is found and completely characterized",
    ". this characterization is numerically verified for many cases . finally , this characterization and @xmath16 unless @xmath18 or @xmath17 are proven .",
    "the following theorem follows immediately from lemma [ lem : ros ] by taking @xmath35 and observing that @xmath36 .",

    "theorem [ thm : orthogonalarray ] converts the bulutoglu and margot [ 1 ] integer linear programming ( ilp ) problem with equalities to an ilp problem with inequalities only .",
    "this is done by deleting the set of basic variables @xmath30 with @xmath41 after implementing gaussian elimination .",
    "deletion of these variables is only possible because the coefficients of all @xmath30 are @xmath42 and the coefficients of @xmath31 with @xmath43 are all integers at the end of gaussian elimination .",
    "the substance of lemma [ lem : ros ] in [ 6 ] is that it correctly identifies which set of basic variables is an integer combination of the remaining variables .",
    "this enables us to delete these variables from the bulutoglu and margot [ 1 ] ilp . in section [ sec : sym ] , it is shown that the size of the symmetry group that can be exploited by the solver in [ 3 ] is @xmath44 if variables are deleted and @xmath45 otherwise .",
    "a speed comparison of these two formulations under margot [ 3 ] solver where their corresponding symmetry groups were exploited is made in table 1 . for",
    "each @xmath46 enumerated , the second and third columns of table 1 report the number of enumerated @xmath46 by exploiting the groups of size @xmath45 and @xmath44 before and after deleting variables respectively . likewise ,",
    "fourth and fifth columns report solution times before and after variables are deleted .",
    "even though the new formulation has fewer variables , computational experiments summarized in table 1 suggest that it should not be preferred over the original formulation .",
    "it is evident from table 1 that exploiting the larger symmetry group more than overcomes the additional computational burden of having a larger number of variables .",
    "in fact , the computational savings appear to grow exponentially with the number of variables . on the other hand , the cases oa@xmath47 and oa@xmath48 do buck this trend .    for a general ilp with only equality constraints over non - negative integer vectors ,",
    "deleting variables by using gaussian elimination may not always be possible either because there is no set of basic variables that are integer combinations of the remaining variables plus some integer or it may be very difficult to identify such a set of basic variables .",
    "for example , for the ilp in [ 1 ] when @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , we estimated the proportion of such sets of basic variables to all sets of basic variables to be @xmath52 .",
    "this estimate was calculated by repeating the following procedure @xmath53 times .",
    "first randomly permute the columns of the constraint matrix , augment the resulting matrix with its right hand side , then row reduce it to its reduced row echelon form and record if the output has only integer entries .",
