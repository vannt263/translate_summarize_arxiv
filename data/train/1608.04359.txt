    "perturbation theory in general relativity has by now reached an impressive degree of development .",
    "the context in which it is perhaps most mature is the post - newtonian approximation , which assumes small perturbations to a minkowski metric , weak stresses , and slow motion  at least in regions exterior to any compact bodies which may be present @xcite . with these assumptions ,",
    "one essentially has a systematic algorithm which can be used to generate as many terms as desired in approximate solutions to einstein s equation .",
    "while considerable calculational effort is required to obtain each new term , many of the underlying conceptual issues have now been resolved . despite this , there are various senses in which the resulting approximations might not be optimal : they may fail to incorporate all available information , the chosen variables might be poorly adapted to the physical degrees of freedom , and so on .",
    "similar comments apply , of course , to perturbative methods used in almost every branch of physics .    for these reasons and others",
    ", it can be useful to apply `` convergence acceleration '' or `` resummation '' techniques , which attempt to improve the overall quality of an approximation by combining information from one or more systematic expansions together with physically - motivated guesses for the behavior of the higher - order terms . some such techniques ",
    "richardson extrapolation , shanks transforms , borel summation , pad approximants , and so on  adopt a generic approach , taking into account mainly the mathematical structure of whichever partial sums happen to be available @xcite",
    ". whether or not any of these techniques might be useful in a particular problem can depend on the presence and locations of poles , whether the higher - order coefficients are monotonic or oscillatory , or other qualitative features .",
    "they do not , however , depend on details of the underlying physics .",
    "as a consequence , these types of techniques can improve approximations in a wide range of physically - dissimilar problems .",
    "other resummation techniques are more specialized , attempting to directly take advantage of the detailed physical or mathematical features specific to the problem at hand .",
    "perhaps the most developed of these techniques in general relativity are incorporated into the effective - one - body approach @xcite , which uses some of the aforementioned generic resummation techniques , physical arguments , and information from the extreme - mass - ratio and post - newtonian approximations to motivate a scaffold upon which a `` complete '' solution to the black hole two - body problem might be built .",
    "one finds , e.g. , that at least at low orders , the post - newtonian hamiltonians which describe the conservative dynamics of two black holes simplify considerably after applying the resummations and variable redefinitions associated with the effective - one - body approach .",
    "these results and others provide strong evidence that existing systematic approximation schemes in general relativity can be improved .",
    "while various techniques have already been applied in different contexts , it is mostly unclear why or when any of these techniques work .",
    "a systematic understanding is severely lacking , and progress is made largely by _",
    "ad hoc _ experimentation .",
    "it appears useful at this stage to consolidate what has been learned , and to attempt a more systematic approach in which improved approximation techniques are obtained directly from the underlying theory .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present one new result which might eventually be incorporated into the development of just such a formalism .",
    "our discussion can be interpreted in the context of gauge choice .",
    "existing approaches to perturbation theory in general relativity adopt particular gauges mainly to simplify calculations or to provide more transparent physical interpretations , but not to improve accuracy ; gauges are typically viewed as having no true physical content . while this is indeed true for exact solutions , it is not necessarily so in perturbation theory .",
    "two approximations which are gauge - equivalent at a given perturbative order might have higher - order errors which are quite different .",
    "it would clearly be advantageous to identify a gauge which systematically minimizes these higher - order errors .",
    "this paper provides just such a gauge , at least for a certain class of metrics .",
    "more precisely , we show that when it exists , the application of a particular first - order gauge transformation eliminates _ all _ higher - order errors ; first - order approximations are transformed into exact solutions to einstein s equation .",
    "while the technique applies only to very special metrics , it does so for some of the most important examples which are known .",
    "in particular , it works for kerr black holes .",
    "it does not apply directly for the more complicated example of a black hole binary , although much of the strong - field region in such a system is `` close '' to kerr , and one might expect that the majority of the strong - field behavior  which is otherwise difficult to capture in perturbation theory  might be taken into account via a scheme inspired by the one described here .    interpreted somewhat differently , our result draws attention to the fact that small parameters are not the only structures which can simplify approximations in general relativity ; the details of a perturbation s tensorial structure can also be essential .",
    "the lorentzian nature of relativistic metrics allows , for example , the presence of nontrivial perturbations which square to zero .",
    "these behave much more simply in einstein s equation than more general perturbations , and are precisely the cases highlighted here .",
    "it appears fortuitous that perturbations with this mathematical structure arise not merely as curiosities , but also as descriptions for some of the most physically - important spacetimes which are known .",
