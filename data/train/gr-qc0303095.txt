    "this cut causes an algebraically decaying late - time tail in the gravitational - wave signal @xcite . for moderate @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", it has recently been investigated numerically  @xcite , leading to a clear conjecture for the large-@xmath11 behavior . in a separate development ,",
    "the strings of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) parallel on both sides of the cut and close to it seem to offer clues to the quantum theory , in particular to a calculation of the bekenstein entropy in loop quantum gravity and to the quantum of area  @xcite .",
    "these motivate studying also the branch cut asymptotically , which will turn out to have ample independent interest .    in each @xmath13-sector and in the frequency domain ,",
    "the rwe is one - dimensional , so the above - mentioned green s function @xmath14 can be written as |g(x , y;)=,y < x . here",
    ", @xmath15 solves ( [ rwe ] ) with the left outgoing - wave boundary condition ( owc ) @xmath16 and thus represents waves going into the horizon , while @xmath17 corresponds to waves going to infinity ; @xmath18 is their wronskian . in the physical region @xmath19 , these asymptotic definitions are unambiguous only for @xmath20 , from where",
    "the functions are continued analytically .",
    "the normalizations of @xmath21 have been fixed for definiteness , but @xmath22 in the denominator renders ( [ green ] ) normalization - independent . since @xmath23 ,",
    "the function @xmath24 is single - valued in  @xmath9 .",
    "thus it is intuitively clear , and readily shown  @xcite , that the branch cut in @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the one in  @xmath26 .",
    "focusing on the latter , we define @xmath27 as the continuations from @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 satisfy the _",
    "( linear , second - order ) wave equation , @xmath31 is the small solution @xmath32 . the simple symmetry @xmath33 renders @xmath34 imaginary , so we introduce the real cut strength @xmath35 through @xcite g(x ,- i)=iq()g(x,+i ) .",
    "since @xmath26 is defined by the owc at @xmath8 , ( [ def - q ] ) defines @xmath35 not merely @xmath36-independent , but rather independent of @xmath37 at any finite @xmath36 : if , say , @xmath38 , the corresponding @xmath39 and @xmath40 are identical .",
    "thus , @xmath35 economically characterizes @xmath34 ( and ultimately @xmath41 ) , and our task can now be specified as calculating the asymptotics of @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath43 , in particular on the nia , the simple asymptotic definition of @xmath44 becomes all but meaningless , since it is impossible to distinguish the decaying component @xmath45 ( to be set to zero ) from the ` pure ' outgoing wave @xmath46 , where this limiting form however has algebraic corrections to all orders in  @xmath47 .",
    "one way out is to complement the analytic continuation in frequency with one in _ space _",
    "@xcite , so that the product @xmath48 retains a negative real part . however , in terms of @xmath36 , the very equation ( [ rwe ] ) is multiple valued , so that the analysis henceforth will proceed in the complex @xmath5-plane , _ viz . _ , [ r^2(r-1)^2d_r^2+r(r-1)d_r -(r-1)\\{(1)r-3}+^2r^4]g=0.[rwe - r ]    it is possible to impose the owc for @xmath49 [ @xmath50 directly and stably for @xmath51 , and continue the solutions to the physical @xmath52 in the upper ( lower ) half plane  @xcite",
    ". that is , apart from a trivial overall phase , @xmath53 are the _ same _ solutions as @xmath5 grows from @xmath54 , until they are prescribed to encircle the singularity @xmath0 in opposite directions .",
    "hence , closer study of this point should shed light on their difference  @xmath34 .",
    "at least away from the singularities @xmath55 and the anti - stokes lines ( _ v.i .",
    "_ ) , one expects to have asymptotic expansions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with g_(r,)~[(r-1)e^r]^i \\{1+++ } , where the first factor is just a plane wave in the tortoise coordinate .",

    "that is , these two orders still agree with the upshot of @xmath9-expanding the standard wkb expression , though this is no longer true for @xmath61 , which involves @xmath62 ( of course , there are higher - order corrections to wkb as well ) .",
    "the anti - stokes lines of the rwe on the nia for this expansion are shown in fig .",
    "[ anti - stokes ] .",
    "they are the curves where @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) ; for @xmath65 , these are the boundaries where the solutions ( [ ga ] ) change between exponentially growing and decaying characters .    thus , the solution which is small for @xmath66 can be continued to the region including @xmath67 , but this only yields the exponentially growing part one knew all along . from there , the solution can__not _ _ be continued back to @xmath68 ( where its imaginary part could be identified ) because of the stokes phenomenon . for the latter continuation , we apparently have to pass through the eye of the storm  the black - hole singularity @xmath0  @xcite . near @xmath0 , the expansion ( [ ga ] ) is not valid , for higher - order terms only become small if @xmath69 .",
    "one therefore has to match ( possibly different ) expansions in terms of @xmath70 in the regions @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "this is similar to the connection procedure near classical turning points in bohr ",
    "sommerfeld quantization .",
    "however , near the latter it is merely the asymptotic expansion which breaks down , while the original ( schrdinger ) wave equation is perfectly regular . in our case",
    ", the connection has to be carried out across a singularity of the rwe .",
    "series expansion around @xmath0 is standard  @xcite :    [ psi12 ] @xmath73    where both error terms are single - valued , and where we introduced the _ algebraically special frequency _ @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "however , because of the large term @xmath75 in the rwe ( [ rwe - r ] ) , higher - order terms in these expansions can only be omitted if @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "the given terms of @xmath77 ) .",
    "thus , there is no overlap with the region of validity of @xmath70 , where matching could be carried out .",
    "still , the above series for @xmath78 will be useful for comparison , _ inter alia _ yielding the exact monodromy  @xcite @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "a usable matching solution follows by effectively resumming the large-@xmath81 parts of higher - order terms in ( [ psi12 ] ) . in practice , it is more convenient to set @xmath82 and sort powers of  @xmath11 : @xmath83\\psi=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\c } }     [ 2t^3d_t^2-t^2d_t-\\{\\ell(\\ell{+}1)+3\\}t]\\psi+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\c^{-1})\\equiv r(t)\\;,\\\\    \\psi=\\psi^{(0)}+\\psi^{(1)}+\\cdots\\;.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the lowest order follows by equating the rhs of ( [ r ] ) to zero :    @xmath84    these have not been written in terms of modified bessel functions , since the subsequent matching is best done on the anti - stokes lines where @xmath85 is real .",

    "again , one verifies that the leading small-@xmath94 correction [ @xmath95 in ( [ psi2 ] ) ] is reproduced correctly . using the standard branching properties of the @xmath96 one",
    "now finds that , up to this second order , @xmath97 , so that the exact monodromy is approached for @xmath98 .",

    "the power - law asymptotic corrections in @xmath94 follow directly from the rwe ; the real nonlocal information is contained in  @xmath112 .",
    "we can use the general rules ( [ rotate ] ) to transform ( [ match - asy ] ) to @xmath113 , and demand consistency for the ( @xmath114 ) part that dominates for @xmath115 .",
    "this leads to @xmath116 and @xmath117 . by subsequently demanding consistency also for the combination of @xmath118 and @xmath77 which is minimal in the same sector , one finds = -(2+i )",
    "thus , this algebraic exercise circumvented directly expanding the integrals ( [ psi21 ] ) for  @xmath119 .",
    "for @xmath120 one can do the analogous expansion of @xmath121 in  ( [ ga ] ) .",
    "again , one finds a gaussian form if @xmath122  @xcite :    g_+(t ,- i)&~e^ice^-t^2/2 ;    the first factor comes from encircling the horizon @xmath123 .",
    "the leading corrections verify the consistency of expansions ( [ match - asy ] ) and ( [ ga - asy ] ) , obtained in very different ways ; all that matters for the matching is @xmath124=1 + 0\\cdot t^0\\!/\\!\\sqrt{\\c}+\\cdots$ ] .",
    "comparison shows that g_+e^-ic= ( 3ic^3/2+(2 - 3i)+())_1 + ( -+ + (c^-3/2))_2 , which can be matched back to solutions in terms of @xmath70 on @xmath103 , yielding g_+(-i)=g_(-i ) + 2e^2ic(i+)g_(+i ) in the region ( bounded by anti - stokes lines ) including @xmath123 .",
    "hence , in particular in the physical part @xmath68 of that region , one has    g(-i)&=2ig_+(-i)=4ig(+i ) + & iq()g(+i ) .    already , the numerically observed asymptotics  @xcite of @xmath125 have been confirmed . for the corrections , it remains to calculate @xmath126 in closed form .",
    "let us start with the @xmath127-dependent term in ( [ r1 ] ) , which clearly can not be combined with the other two .",
    "straightforward manipulations yield its contribution to @xmath87 as ( @xmath103 ) _ 1^(1)(t)~. by considering the asymptotics of @xmath128 ( @xmath129 are hankel functions ) in the upper - half @xmath130-plane [ again using the formula for @xmath131 above ( [ rotate ] ) ] , one convinces oneself that in fact @xmath132 , which is also necessary for this contribution to @xmath126 to be real .",
    "the latter integral is tabulated as @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "thus , the present contribution to @xmath126 reads _ 1=- .",
    "the last term of ( [ r1 ] ) analogously leads to the integrals @xmath134 , for a contribution _",
    "2=. however , the first term of ( [ r1 ] ) , with its higher power of @xmath135 , leads to diverging integrals : @xmath136 _ if _ @xmath137 , these lead to a real contribution _ 3=-2c_3 .",
    "unfortunately , the general @xmath138 does not help directly , since not enough seems to be known about the asymptotics of  @xmath139 .",
    "instead , one can proceed as follows : @xmath137 can again be proven by studying @xmath140 in the upper - half plane .",
    "it is then logical to also consider @xmath141 , in which one can take @xmath142 .",
    "one finds c_3=_0^dww^3/2k_1 ^ 2(w ) = .",
    "the rest is straightforward : ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) , and ( [ a3 ] ) with ( [ c3 ] ) can be added and substituted into ( [ delta - g ] ) , from which one can read off our final answer q()~4(2)+",

    "preliminary results from a transmission - amplitude calculation seem to support the form for the corrections , in particular the @xmath13-dependence  @xcite .",
    "the above analysis , for @xmath144 , is the third instance where the mathematics of the rwe near @xmath0 has been seen to influence the goings - on in our universe @xmath52 .",
    "the first instance is the question of ` anomalous ' vs ` miraculous ' waves outgoing into the horizon , i.e. , @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( @xcite , section  vi ) .",
    "the second instance is the dynamics at and around the algebraically special frequency @xmath147 , where the rwe has closed - form solutions , whose global behavior in the @xmath5-plane can therefore be traced  @xcite .",
    "besides the axial waves described by the rwe ( [ rwe])([v ] ) there are also polar waves , described by the zerilli equation  @xcite . however , the latter s ` intertwining ' or supersymmetry relation to the rwe yields its cut strength as @xmath148q(\\c)$ ]  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath35 and @xmath149 agree up to an overall sign , plus @xmath150 corrections immaterial to  ( [ q - res ] ) .    for an outlook ,",
    "the first obvious item is the numerical verification of ( [ q - res ] ) , in particular of the sub - leading correction .",
    "a brute - force increase of numerical precision in the existing method is unlikely to suffice , especially for @xmath151 .",
    "more promising is to calculate @xmath152 directly on the nia , instead of through extrapolation to this axis . in the series for @xmath44 @xcite ,",
    "the problem for @xmath153 is not convergence but rather obtaining the individual ( irregular - hypergeometric ) terms reliably .",
    "working this out should be mainly a matter of time , but it remains to be seen if it would sufficiently extend the range of validity in  @xmath11 .",
    "related to this , it is worth re - emphasizing  @xcite that the present method involves two conceptually separate steps : ( a )  the continuation in  @xmath5 , stabilizing the owc at infinity in the lower - half @xmath9-plane , leading to a well - defined computational problem , and ( b )  the asymptotics , by which one can actually solve this problem analytically for large  @xmath11 .",
    "the second step is optional  @xcite , and numerical integration of @xmath154 from @xmath155 ( combined with standard series solutions for  @xmath15 ) should soon open up the third @xmath9-quadrant ( i.e. , behind the cut ) to direct exploration , especially for at most moderate damping",
    ".    it would also be interesting if this work could be compared to the closed - form expression for @xmath125 in ( 31)(33 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , through the coefficients @xmath156 of an expansion @xmath157 ; here , @xmath158 are coulomb wave functions . as usual , the @xmath156 satisfy a three - term recursion relation ( given in a simplified form , which can be made purely real on the nia , in section  vi  f of  @xcite ) ; @xmath159 is to be chosen such that @xmath156 is the minimal solution to this relation for both @xmath160 and  @xmath161 .",
    "the adiabatic ansatz of slowly varying @xmath162 readily yields asymptotic solutions for @xmath65 , except near @xmath163 and @xmath164 . following ref .",
    "@xcite , one can try to develop connection formulas near these three points , which would determine @xmath127 analytically . at",
    "the ` turning points ' @xmath163 , the three - term recursion asymptotically degenerates into a _",
    "two_-term one , and the connection proceeds exactly as in  @xcite .",
    "near @xmath164 , however , all three terms are of the same order ( in  @xmath11 ) , and the recursion remains in the form of analytically intractable continued fractions ( i.e. , without simplifying to products ) .",
    "thus , this route for now seems unfeasible .    at least to leading order ,",
    "the method of continuation through the vicinity of @xmath0 has meanwhile independently been used to calculate the high - damping qnm frequencies  @xcite . on the one hand , this yields more information on the qnm _ wave functions _ than the continued - fraction technique  @xcite . on the other ,",
    "this clearly establishes a relation to the present problem of the branch - cut strength  @xmath125 .",
    "thus one can expect also _ numerical _",
    "results for these two high - damping aspects of the rwe to bear on each other , and an extension to other black - hole models .",
    "conversely , this work s progress on the corrections should help finding the @xmath165 terms for the asymptotic qnm frequencies .",
    "meanwhile , this has indeed been possible ; see the appendix .",
    "in particular , these developments render it urgent to study the branch cut of the rwe s green s function also for other values of the spin  @xmath135 , where ( [ v ] ) corresponds to @xmath166 .",
    "notably , the highly damped electromagnetic ( @xmath167 ) qnms are predicted  @xcite to approach the nia asymptotically so that one expects an even closer , though yet unknown , relation to the branch cut in that case .",
    "the work of the main text was performed in summer 2001 during a sabbatical as a c.n .",
    "yang visiting fellow at the chinese university of hong kong . the recent activity in this field has prompted me to publish my original notes .",
    "i thank v.  cardoso , a.  neitzke , and k.  young for fruitful discussions .",
    "for frequencies close to the nia , it should certainly be possible to analytically continue  ( [ g - match ] ) and find those @xmath11 for which @xmath154 also satisfies the owc into the horizon , i.e.  @xmath168 .",
    "these should identify the highly damped qnms .",
    "here , @xmath15 is characterized by its monodromy around the horizon : f(r-1)e^2i,=e^2f(r-1 , ) . inspecting  ( [ ga ] )",
    ", it seems that ` @xmath169 ' , but this is deceptive . while it _ is _ true that @xmath170 in the lower - half @xmath9-plane , the asymptotic nature of the large ( near @xmath123 ) solution @xmath171 means that naive rotation of @xmath172 only confirms the desired monodromy to dominant order , whereas @xmath15 is required to obey it exactly .",
    "the solution is to , in the spirit of @xcite , do the rotation along the anti - stokes contour in fig .",
    "[ anti - stokes ] , where neither solution dominates the other ( skipping @xmath0 on the inside ) . by the normalization of @xmath15 one knows the dominant component , so we take the ansatz f(-i)=g_(i)+c()g_(-i ) . continuing this from the physical @xmath173 to @xmath174 with @xmath175 ,",
