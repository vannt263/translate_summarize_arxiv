    "the experimental data on these decays are becoming available now @xcite , and the @xmath0 factories will provide more accurate and comprehensive data .",
    "it is necessary to note that the experiment shows that only approximately 60% of the inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decay rate is due to the decays to ground state pseudoscalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath12 mesons .",
    "thus the rest of these decays should go to excited @xmath1 meson and continuum states .",
    "the presence of the heavy quark in the initial and final meson states in these decays considerably simplifies their theoretical description . a good starting point for this analysis",

    "the kinematically allowed range for these decays is not broad .",
    "as a result the role of relativistic and finite heavy quark mass contributions not vanishing at zero recoil is considerably more important here than in the decays to ground state @xmath1 mesons .",
    "thus , the magnitude of such corrections might be comparable with the leading order result .",
    "recently the first order @xmath2 corrections to the exclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decays into excited charmed mesons were investigated within the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the structure of the @xmath2 corrections to decay matrix elements , which follows from qcd and heavy quark symmetry , was determined .",
    "it was found that at the first order of heavy quark expansion the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 matrix elements do not vanish at zero recoil and can be expressed at this kinematical point in terms of the leading isgur  wise functions .",
    "away from the zero recoil point new subleading isgur  wise functions arise , which can not be determined from symmetry considerations alone .",

    "the @xmath2 contribution at zero recoil is not equal to zero , but it is suppressed by a very small factor @xmath196 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gv1 ] ) ) , which is only @xmath197  gev@xmath198 for our model parameters . as a result",
    "the @xmath158 decay rate receives @xmath2 contributions comparable to those for the @xmath155 rate .",
    "the above discussion shows that the sharp increase of @xmath6 and @xmath28 decay rates by first order @xmath2 corrections does not signal the breakdown of the heavy quark expansion , but is rather a result of the interplay of kinematical and dynamical effects .",
    "thus we have good reasons to expect that higher order @xmath2 corrections will influence these decay rates at the level of 10  20 % .    in table",
    "[ bd ] we present the experimental data from cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite , which are available only for the @xmath32 decay . for @xmath155 , these experimental groups present only upper limits , which require the use of some additional assumptions about the hadronic branching ratios of the @xmath199 meson .",
    "our result for the branching ratio of the @xmath6 decay with the inclusion of @xmath2 corrections is in good agreement with both measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "our branching ratio for the @xmath155 decay is only within the cleo upper limit and disagrees with the aleph one .",
    "however , there are some reasons to expect that the aleph bound is too strong @xcite .    in table  [ br ]",
    "we present our predictions for the ratios of decay rates @xmath155 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and of the sum of all @xmath22 decay rates to the rate @xmath6 both in the limit @xmath51 , and taking into account the @xmath2 corrections .",
    "it is reasonable to consider such ratios in order to normalize to a measured rate . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that a ratio @xmath200 is a mere consequence of the heavy quark symmetry . in the heavy quark limit",
    "we confirm this result .",
    "however , the inclusion of @xmath2 corrections strongly influences this prediction and considerably reduce this ratio to a value close to 1 .",
    "such a reduction seems to be favoured by available experimental data . in the last row of table  [ br ]",
    "we give the sum of all @xmath22 branching ratios .",
    "we see that our model predicts that 1.45% of @xmath0 meson decays go to the first orbitally excited @xmath1 meson states .",
    "this result means that approximately 2.5% of @xmath0 decays should go to higher excitations .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot the electron spectra @xmath201 for @xmath22 decays . here",
    "@xmath202 is the rescaled lepton energy .",
    "these differential decay rates can be easily obtained from double differential decay rates ( [ ddr1 ] ) , ( [ ddr2 ] ) , using the relation @xmath203 and then integrating in @xmath67 over @xmath204/[2r(1-y)]<w<(1+r^2)/(2r)$ ] .",
    "we present our results both in the heavy quark limit @xmath13 ( dashed curves ) and with the inclusion of first order @xmath2 corrections ( solid curves ) .",
    "finally we test the fulfilment of the bjorken sum rule @xcite in our model .",
    "this sum rule states @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the slope of the @xmath207 isgur  wise function , @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the form factors describing the orbitally excited states discussed here and their radial excitations , and ellipses denote contributions from non - resonant channels .",
    "we see that the contribution of the lowest lying @xmath17-wave states implies the bound @xmath210 which is in agreement with the slope @xmath211 in our model @xcite and with experimental values @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have applied the relativistic quark model to the consideration of semileptonic @xmath0 decays to orbitally excited charmed mesons , in the leading and subleading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "we have found an interesting interplay of the relativistic and finite heavy quark mass contributions . in particular , it has been found that the lorentz transformation properties of meson wave functions play an important role in the theoretical description of these decays .",
    "thus , the wigner rotation of the light quark spin gives a significant contribution already at the leading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "this contribution considerably reduces the leading order isgur  wise function @xmath75 with respect to @xmath52 . as a result , in this limit , the decay rates @xmath157 and @xmath158 are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the decay rates @xmath6 and @xmath155 . on the other hand , inclusion of the first order @xmath2 corrections also substantially influences the decay rates",
    "this large effect of subleading heavy quark corrections is a consequence of the vanishing of the leading order contributions to the decay matrix elements due to heavy quark spin - flavour symmetry at the point of zero recoil of the final charmed meson .",
    "however , the subleading order contributions to @xmath6 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 do not vanish at this kinematical point . since the kinematical range for these decays is rather small , the role of these corrections is considerably increased .",
    "their account results in an approximately twofold enhancement of the @xmath6 and @xmath157 decay rates , while the @xmath155 and @xmath158 rates are increased only slightly .",
    "the small influence of @xmath2 corrections on the @xmath158 decay rate is the consequence of the additional interplay of @xmath212 and @xmath213 corrections at the zero recoil point ( see eq .",
    "( [ gv1 ] ) ) .",
    "we thus see that these subleading heavy quark corrections turn out to be very important and considerably change the infinitely heavy quark limit results . for example",
    ", the ratio of branching ratios @xmath214 changes from the value of about 1.6 in the heavy quark limit , @xmath13 , to the value of about 1 after subleading corrections are included .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented here the first self - consistent dynamical calculation of subleading heavy quark corrections in the framework of the relativistic quark model , which are found to be in agreement with the hqet predictions .",
