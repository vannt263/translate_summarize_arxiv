    "furthermore , unexpected behavior has been recently found in the level statistics of some @xmath1 spin chains .",
    "@xcite robust non - wigner behavior has been seen in the level - spacing distributions of next - nearest - neighbor coupled @xmath1 chains , although they are nonintegrable .",
    "the reason why it appears is not clear yet , although we have considered two possible reasons : extra symmetries or finite - size effects .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the level - spacing distribution of a disordered @xmath1 spin chain so that we may find possible clues to the unexpected behavior of the @xmath1 spin chains .",
    "we consider specifically the spin-@xmath11 @xmath1 spin chain with random magnetic field , where quantum integrability competes with nonintegrability due to the randomness .",
    "the hamiltonian on @xmath2 sites is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath15 is random magnetic field along the @xmath16 axis at site @xmath17 ; the periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the random magnetic field @xmath15 s are uncorrelated random numbers with a gaussian distribution : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . here",
    "we recall that the system ( [ eq : h ] ) is integrable when @xmath20 , while it is not when @xmath21 .",
    "we show explicitly how the level - spacing distribution @xmath22 depends on the lattice size @xmath2 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath3 , and the mean amplitude of the random magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "for some special cases of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) , the level statistics has been discussed .",
    "the present numerical results should make explicit connections among them and even extend them .",
    "when @xmath5 , @xmath22 mostly shows wigner - like behavior . for the heisenberg case ( @xmath23 ) , it has been shown that @xmath22 coincides with @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite when @xmath6 , poisson - like behavior appears although the system is nonintegrable due to the randomness .",
    "however , the result is consistent with the anderson localization of one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "the wigner - like behavior for @xmath5 suggests that the anderson localization in 1d systems should be broken by the interaction such as the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "here we note that an analogous phenomenon has been observed in the 2d anderson model with electron interaction .",
    "@xcite in the large @xmath4 and small @xmath4 limits , poisson - like behavior appears again for @xmath5 , which is consistent with the numerical results for spin - glass clusters ,  @xcite the open - boundary heisenberg chain ,  @xcite and the 3d anderson model .",
    "@xcite furthermore , we find that @xmath22 depends on the lattice size @xmath2 , particularly when the random field is weak .",
    "there is another motivation for the present study .",
    "the symmetry of the integrable quantum @xmath1 spin chain can be nontrivial .",
    "an extraordinary symmetry appears for special values of @xmath3 : the @xmath1 hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath24 loop algebra when @xmath25 is a root of unity , where @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite the loop algebra is an infinite - dimensional lie algebra , and the dimensions of degenerate eigenspaces are given by some exponential functions of the system size , which can be extremely large .",
    "@xcite it should therefore be nontrivial how the large degeneracies are resolved by nonintegrability .",
    "in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) , total @xmath27 is conserved . the eigenstates with different @xmath27",
    "are uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , we consider only the largest subspace @xmath28 .",
    "the largest sectors for the lattice size @xmath298 , 10 , 12 , 14 have 70 , 252 , 924 , 3432 eigenvalues , respectively ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) .",

    "the unfolded eigenvalues are renormalized values , whose local density of states is equal to unity everywhere in the spectrum . in this paper , the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath30 are obtained from the raw eigenvalues @xmath31 in the following method .",
    "let us define the integrated density of states as @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the step function and @xmath34 is the number of the eigenvalues .",
    "we choose some points of coordinates : @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    "is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the random potential at the @xmath17th site ; @xmath51 is a constant hopping integral ; @xmath52 denotes summation over nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "one can find that eq .",
    "( [ eq : jw ] ) for @xmath6 corresponds to eq.([eq : anderson ] ) of the 1d case .",
    "it is known that localization always occurs in the 1d case , while the 3d anderson model has the metallic phase and the localized phase . here",
    "we recall that the metallic phase corresponds to @xmath10 and the localized phase to @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the observed poisson - like behavior for @xmath6 is consistent with the anderson localization .",

    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) , namely eq .",
    "( [ eq : jw ] ) , for @xmath5 corresponds to interacting 1d fermions under random potential .",
    "thus , the wigner - like behavior of @xmath22 for @xmath5 might suggest that the interaction among fermions should break the anderson localization in 1d chains",
    ". the suggestion could be consistent with the observation on the 2d interacting lattice fermions where the level - spacing distribution changes from @xmath9 to @xmath10 as the electron - electron interaction increases from zero .",
    "@xcite        we now discuss how the level - spacing distribution @xmath22 depends on the random magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "we consider only the case of @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the graphs of @xmath22 are shown for some values of @xmath53 and @xmath2 , where @xmath54 .",
    "we first consider the case of large @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath53 increases from the value of 0.5 , we observe that the form of @xmath22 changes from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "the observation suggests that the effect of random magnetic field on each site should become larger than that of the correlation between adjacent spins , as the random field @xmath53 increases .",
    "the spins should become more independent of each other as @xmath53 increases , since the effect of correlation decreases effectively .",
    "thus , the poisson - like behavior of @xmath22 should appear in the limit of large @xmath53 .",
    "similar shifts from @xmath10 to @xmath9 as randomness increases have been discussed for the 3d anderson model ,  @xcite the spin - glass clusters ,  @xcite and the open - boundary heisenberg chain .",
    "@xcite    for the case of small @xmath4 , the level - spacing distribution @xmath22 strongly depends on the system size @xmath2 , and the behavior of @xmath22 is dominated by finite - size effects . in fig .",
    "2 , we observe that the form of @xmath22 for @xmath55 is different from that of the standard wigner distribution , particularly when @xmath2 is small .",
    "when @xmath2 is small , random magnetic field is irrelevant to energy levels if it is smaller than the order of @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , energy differences should be at least in the order of @xmath56 , and random magnetic field can be neglected if it is much smaller than some multiple of @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for the case of small @xmath4 , the level statistics should show such a behavior as that of @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian for @xmath20 is the integrable @xmath1 spin chain , which should have poisson - like behavior .",
    "furthermore , the integrable @xmath1 hamiltonian at @xmath54 has the @xmath24 loop algebra symmetry ,  @xcite and the level - spacing distribution should show a peak at @xmath57 .",

    "@xmath61 corresponds to the wigner distribution and @xmath62 to the poisson distribution.,width=302 ]    let us discuss finite - size effects on the level - spacing distributions . in order to observe the size dependence of @xmath22 clearly , we employ the following parameter , @xmath63 ds / \\int_0^{s_0 } [ p_{\\rm poi}(s)-p_{\\rm wig}(s ) ] ds $ ] , where @xmath64 is the intersection point of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite thus , we have @xmath61 when @xmath22 coincides with @xmath10 , and @xmath62 when @xmath22 coincides with @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "3 , the value of @xmath59 for @xmath55 strongly depends on the lattice size @xmath2 .",

    "the observation suggests that @xmath59 approaches either the value 0 or 1 as @xmath2 increases . in other words",
    ", it should become more definite whether @xmath22 has wigner - like behavior or not , as the system size becomes large .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the level - spacing distributions of finite spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 chains under random magnetic field , and shown how the level - spacing distributions change between the poisson distribution and the wigner distribution depending on the lattice size @xmath2 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath3 , and the mean amplitude of the random magnetic field @xmath4 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the level - spacing distribution @xmath22 almost coincides with the poisson distribution although the system has the randomness . as @xmath3 increases from zero , @xmath22 rapidly shifts to the wigner distribution .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath22 have been explained in terms of anderson localization . for @xmath5 , @xmath22 strongly depends on @xmath2 when @xmath4 is small .",
    "when @xmath2 is finite , @xmath22 should show poisson - like behavior in the small @xmath4 limit . in the large @xmath4 limit , however , @xmath22 should become close to the poisson distribution independent of @xmath2 .",
