    "a `` @xmath0 process '' was postulated to produce 35 stable but rare isotopes between @xmath4se and @xmath5hg on the proton - rich side of the valley of stability . unlike the remaining 99% of the heavy elements beyond iron these isotopes can not be created by ( slow or rapid ) neutron captures @xcite , and their solar and isotopic abundances are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the respective @xmath6- and @xmath7-process nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , so far it seems to be impossible to reproduce the solar abundances of all @xmath0 isotopes by one single process . in current understanding",
    "several ( independently operating ) processes seem to contribute .",
    "the largest fraction of @xmath0 isotopes is created in the `` @xmath2 process '' by sequences of photodissociations and @xmath8 decays @xcite .",
    "this occurs in explosive o / ne burning during snii explosions and reproduces the solar abundances for the bulk of @xmath0 isotopes within a factor of @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the sn shock wave induces temperatures of 2 - 3 gk in the outer ( c , ne , o ) layers , sufficient for triggering the required photodisintegrations .",
    "more massive stellar models ( m@xmath1020  m@xmath11 ) seem to reach the required temperatures for efficient photodisintegration already at the end of hydrostatic o / ne burning @xcite .",
    "the decrease in temperature after passage of the shock leads to a freeze - out via neutron captures and mainly @xmath8 decays , resulting in the typical @xmath0-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath12mo ( @xmath3=50 ) and @xmath13sm ( @xmath3=82 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath2 process scenario suffers from a strong underproduction of the most abundant @xmath0 isotopes , @xmath14mo and @xmath15ru , due to lack of seed nuclei with @xmath1690 . for these missing abundances , alternative processes and sites",
    "have been proposed , either using strong neutrino fluxes in the deepest ejected layers of a snii ( @xmath17 process @xcite ) , or rapid proton - captures in proton - rich , hot matter accreted on the surface of a neutron star ( @xmath18 process @xcite ) .",
    "a few @xmath0 nuclides may also be produced by neutrino - induced reactions during the @xmath2-process .",
    "this `` @xmath19 process '' @xcite was additionally introduced because the @xmath2 process alone strongly underproduces the odd - odd isotopes @xmath20la and @xmath21ta .",
    "these two isotopes could be the result of excitation by neutrino scattering on pre - existing @xmath6-process seed nuclei , depending on the still uncertain underlying nuclear physics .",
    "modern , self - consistent studies of the @xmath2-process have problems to synthesize @xmath0 nuclei in the regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are only due to a problem with astrophysical models or also with the nuclear physics input , i.e. the reaction rates used .",
    "thus , the reduction of uncertainties in nuclear data is strictly necessary for a consistent understanding of the @xmath0 process .",
    "experimental data can improve the situation in two ways , either by directly replacing predictions with measured cross sections in the relevant energy range or by testing the reliability of predictions at other energies when the relevant energy range is not experimentally accessible . in this context",
    "we have carried out @xmath0-process network calculations with a modified reaction library which uses the most recent experimental and semi - empirical @xmath1 cross sections from the `` karlsruhe astrophysical database of nucleosynthesis in stars '' project , kadonis v0.2 @xcite .",
    "this aims to be a step towards an improved reaction library for the @xmath0 process , containing more experimental data .",
    "however , it has to be kept in mind that the largest fraction of the @xmath0-process network contains proton - rich , unstable isotopes which are not accessible for cross section measurements with present experimental techniques .",
    "hence there is no alternative to employing theoretical predictions for a large number of reactions .",
    "typically , these come from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations @xcite performed with the codes non - smoker @xcite or most @xcite .",
    "we studied the @xmath0 process in its manifestation as a @xmath2 process .",
    "the network calculations were carried out with the program `` pprosim '' @xcite .",
    "the underlying network was originally based on a reaction library from michigan state university for x - ray bursts which included only proton - rich isotopes up to xenon . for @xmath0-process studies",
    "it was extended by merging it with a full reaction library from basel university @xcite . that reaction library was mainly based on non - smoker predictions with only few experimental information for light nuclei . for the present calculations ,",
    "the library was updated by inclusion of more than 350 experimental and semi - empirical stellar ( @xmath24 ) cross sections from the most recent version of the `` karlsruhe astrophysical database of nucleosynthesis in stars '' ( kadonis v0.2 ) . due to detailed balance",
    "this modification also affects the respective ( @xmath25 ) channels .",
    "the abundance evolution was tracked with a parameterized reaction network , based on a model of a supernova type ii explosion of a 25 m@xmath11 star @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0-process layers are located far outside the collapsing core , they only experience the explosion shock front passing through the o / ne burning zone and the subsequent temperature and density increase .",
    "both , the seed abundances and the respective temperature and density profiles , were taken from @xcite and are not calculated self - consistently .",
    "the @xmath0-process zone in the simulation was subdivided into 14 single layers .",
    "this is consistent with what was used in @xcite and thus the results can directly be compared .",
    "the final @xmath2-process abundances depend very sensitively on the choice of the initial seed abundance .",
    "this initial abundance is produced by in - situ modification of the stellar material in various nucleosynthesis processes during stellar evolution .",
    "this also means that the respective o / ne layers can receive an abundance contribution from the weak @xmath6 process ( core helium and shell carbon burning during the red giant phase of the massive star ) in the mass region up to @xmath26=90 .",
    "the @xmath6-process component depends on the mass of the star and also on the neutron yield provided by the @xmath27ne(@xmath28)@xmath29 mg neutron source .",
    "if the @xmath0-process layers during the explosion are located within the convective zones of the previous helium burning phases , the @xmath6-process abundance distribution in all layers can be assumed to be constant .",
    "thus , it has to be emphasized that the results strongly depend on the adopted stellar model ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite found significant @xmath2-processing occurring already in late stages of hydrostatic burning ) .",
    "additionally , stars with different masses will exhibit different @xmath6- and @xmath0-processing and true @xmath0-abundances can only be derived when employing models of galactical chemical evolution .",
    "nevertheless , for better comparison with previous studies , here we implemented the same approach as used in @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "[ opf ] ) .",
    "the results of our simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ opf ] as normalized overproduction factors",
    "@xmath30@xmath31@xmath32/@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this value gives the produced abundance relative to the solar abundances of anders and grevesse @xcite .",
    "ranges of variations of this factor for sn type ii explosions with stellar masses 13  @xmath34@xmath35@xmath3625  @xmath34 are published in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "the factor @xmath33 is the so - called averaged overproduction factor which is a measure for the overall enrichment of all @xmath0 isotopes .",
    "this value changed only by -0.6% from @xmath33=86.3 ( previous library @xcite ) to @xmath33=85.8 ( modified library ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 are the mean overproduction factor calculated from the mass of the respective isotope @xmath37 in the @xmath0-process zone divided by the total mass of the @xmath0-process zone times the respective solar mass fraction of the isotope . in fig .",
    "[ opf ] our results with the modified reaction library are compared to the results published in @xcite with the previous set of reaction rates to examine the influence of the newly implemented neutron capture data of kadonis v0.2 .",
    "the result is a decrease in the normalized overproduction factor for almost all @xmath0 isotopes by an average value of -7% ( shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ opf ] as dashed line ) .",
    "the largest deviations occur for @xmath38sr ( -20.5% ) , @xmath39ce ( + 30.6% ) , @xmath40dy ( -39.2% ) , @xmath41gd and @xmath42dy ( -22.3% each ) , @xmath43w , and @xmath44pt ( -32% ) .",
    "star model of rayet et al .",
    "@xcite are given for comparison ( grey stars ) .",
    "a value equal to unity corresponds to the solar abundance .",
    "right : abundance difference for each @xmath0 isotope between the modified and the previous reaction library . ]    in general , these differences are relatively strong in the mass region @xmath26=150 - 170 .",
    "reaction flux plots of this mass region reveal that the main flux proceeds by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath1 , and @xmath47 reactions , and is lower by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared to the previous reaction library .",
    "this drastic change can not be explained by the implementation of larger experimental @xmath1 cross sections of some of these @xmath0 isotopes , since this would in turn also increase the production channel via @xmath46 reactions from heavier isotopes @xcite .",
    "surprising at first glance , the cause of the differences are changes in the neutron rates at higher masses . a significant fraction of the seed abundances for the @xmath0 process is located in @xmath48bi and the pb isotopes and converted to nuclei at lower mass by photodisintegration sequences starting with @xmath46 reactions .",
    "the importance of experimental data is strongly emphasized by these findings . because of the magicity or near - magicity of the pb and bi isotopes , individual resonances determine the cross sections and hauser - feshbach theory is not applicable @xcite . furthermore , from discrepancies between resonance and activation measurements @xcite and from theoretical considerations @xcite , it has been previously found that a small direct capture component contributes to neutron capture on @xmath49pb @xcite .",
    "the interplay of resonant and direct capture contributions is difficult to handle in theoretical models and experiments prove to be indispensable .",
    "this also explains why there are deviations up to factor of 1.7 - 2 between the non - smoker predictions and experimental data for these nuclei @xcite .",
    "in fact , hauser - feshbach models can not be applied there . for the cases where",
    "the statistical model can be applied , the average non - smoker uncertainty for stellar @xmath1 cross sections is only @xmath5030% or even better .    the nuclides @xmath41gd and @xmath51er are not produced in the present simulation based on a 25 m@xmath11 star .",
    "this is consistent with previous work finding large @xmath6-process contributions to these nuclei .",
    "also , the two odd-@xmath26 isotopes @xmath52 in and @xmath53sn are not produced .",
    "the latter underproduction problem is known since a long time @xcite .",
    "the initial seed abundances of @xmath52 in and @xmath53sn are destroyed by the @xmath2 process , since the destruction channel is much stronger than the production channel .",
    "thus , it appears as if the nuclides @xmath41gd , @xmath51er , @xmath52 in , and @xmath53sn have strong contributions from other processes and it is conceivable that they even may not be assigned to the group of @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "nemeth et al .",
    "@xcite determined the contributions for @xmath52 in , and @xmath53sn with the ( out - dated ) classical @xmath6-process approach to be very small ( less than 1% for both cases ) .",
    "these calculations in the cd - in - sn region are complicated since many isomeric states have to be considered , and the @xmath7-process may contribute to the abundances of @xmath52cd and @xmath53 in .",
    "although these two isotopes have quasi - stable ground - states , the @xmath54-decays of @xmath7-process progenitor nuclei can proceed via isomeric states : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath56 @xmath52 in and @xmath58cd @xmath56@xmath59 @xmath56 @xmath53sn . in @xcite",
    "only part of the missing abundances could be ascribed to post-@xmath7-process @xmath54-decay chains , leaving rather large residues for other production mechanisms . in view of the progress achieved in @xmath6-process calculations using the tp - agb star model , and with the availability of an improved set of @xmath1 cross sections it appears worth while to update these older calculations .",
    "the new reaction library kadonis @xcite includes the latest maxwellian averaged cross sections from very accurate time - of - flight measurements for the cd and sn isotopes @xcite and will soon be complemented by a measurement of the partial neutron capture cross section to the 14.1  y isomeric state in the @xmath6-process branching isotope @xmath52cd with the activation technique , which is underway at forschungszentrum karlsruhe . with this additional information",
    "new calculations are expected to provide more accurate @xmath6- and @xmath7-contributions for @xmath52cd and @xmath53 in .",
    "based on these results , the @xmath0-contributions can be estimated as the residual via @xmath60=@xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 .",
