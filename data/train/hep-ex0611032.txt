    "decays of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 states are not as well studied experimentally and theoretically as those of other charmonium states .",
    "these states have charge - conjugation eigenvalue @xmath14 , in contrast to the better - studied @xmath15 states @xmath16 and @xmath1 .",
    "their decay products thus will differ from those of @xmath16 and @xmath1 , and may provide complementary information on states containing light quarks and gluons .",
    "it is possible that the color - octet mechanism , @xmath17 , could have large effects on the observed decay pattern of the @xmath18 states  @xcite . assuming that @xmath18 are the @xmath19 @xmath20 bound states one would expect that @xmath2 and @xmath4 with @xmath21 quantum numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 decay to light quarks via two gluons  @xcite .",
    "measurement of any possible @xmath18 hadronic decays provides valuable information on possible glueball dynamics .",
    "thus knowledge of any hadronic decay channels for these states is valuable .",
    "cleo has gathered a large sample of @xmath24 events , which leads to copious production of the @xmath18 states in radiative decays of the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 branching fractions have been recently measured @xcite with high precision : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 we describe a study of selected three - body hadronic decay modes of the @xmath18 to two charged and one neutral hadron .",
    "this is not an exhaustive study of @xmath18 hadronic decays ; we do not even comprehensively cover all possible @xmath28 decays , but simply take a first look at the rich structure of @xmath18 decays in our initial @xmath1 data sets .",
    "a subset of these modes has been investigated by bes  @xcite . with the cleo iii detector configuration  @xcite ,",
    "we have recorded an integrated luminosity of 2.57  pb@xmath29 and the number of @xmath1 events is @xmath30 . with the cleo - c detector configuration  @xcite",
    "we have recorded 2.89  pb@xmath29 , and the number of events is @xmath31 .",
    "the apparent mis - match of luminosities and event totals is due to different beam energy spreads for the two data sets .",
    "our basic technique is an exclusive whole - event analysis searching for @xmath32 followed by a three body decay of the @xmath18 to @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 .",
    "a photon candidate is combined with three hadrons and their 4-momentum sum constrained to the known total beam energy and the initial momentum caused by the two beams crossing at a small angle taking into account the measured errors on the reconstructed charged tracks , neutral hadron , and transition photon .",
    "we cut on the @xmath33 of this fit , which has four degrees of freedom , as it strongly discriminates between background and signal . for most modes we select events with an event 4-momentum fit @xmath33 less than 25 , but background from @xmath34 followed by charged two - body decays of the @xmath16 , with one of the @xmath35 decay photons lost , fakes @xmath36 .",
    "for this mode the cut on @xmath33 is tightened to 12 .",
    "the efficiency of this cut is @xmath37 95% for all modes except @xmath10 , where it is @xmath37 80% .",
    "efficiencies and backgrounds are studied in a geant - based simulation  @xcite of the detector response to @xmath24 events .",
    "our simulated sample is roughly ten times our data sample .",
    "the radiated photon is generated according to an angular distribution of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the radiated photon angle relative to the positron beam axis .",
    "an e1 transition , as expected for @xmath40 , implies @xmath41 for @xmath42 particles .",
    "the efficiencies we quote use this simulation , and differ from efficiencies using @xmath43 by up to a few percent .",
    "photon candidates are selected by their energy depositions in the csi crystal calorimeter .",
    "they have a transverse shape consistent with that expected for an electromagnetic shower without a charged track pointing toward it .",
    "they are required to have an energy of at least 30 mev .",
    "photon candidates that are used to make neutral particles further must have an energy of more than 50 mev if they are not in the barrel , @xmath44 , of our calorimeter .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 candidates are formed from two - photon candidates that are kinematically fit to the known resonance masses using the event vertex position , determined using charged tracks constrained to the beam spot .",
    "we select events with a @xmath33 from the kinematic mass fit with one degree of freedom of less than 10 . transition photon candidates are vetoed if they form a @xmath35 or @xmath47 candidate when paired with a second photon candidate .",
    "we also reconstruct the @xmath48 mode combining two charged pions with a @xmath45 candidate , increasing the number of @xmath47 candidates by about 25% .",
    "the same sort of kinematic mass fit as used for @xmath35 s and @xmath46 is applied to this mode , and again we select those giving a @xmath33 of less than 10 .",
    "similarly we combine the mass - constrained @xmath47 candidates together with two charged pions to make @xmath49 candidates , mass - constrain them , and select those with @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , we include the decay mode @xmath51 .",
    "here the background is potentially high because of the large number of noise photons , so we require @xmath52  mev .",
    "in addition , we require the @xmath53 mass to be within 100  mev / c@xmath54 of the mean @xmath55 mass .    charged tracks satisfy standard requirements @xcite that they be of good fit quality .",
    "those coming from the origin must have an impact parameter with respect to the beam spot less than the greater of @xmath56  mm and 1.2  mm , where @xmath57 is the measured track momentum in gev / c .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 candidates are formed from good - quality tracks that are constrained to come from a common vertex .",
    "the @xmath60 flight path is required to be greater than 5  mm and the @xmath61 flight path greater than 3  mm .",
    "the mass cut around the @xmath60 mass is @xmath62  mev / c@xmath54 , and around the @xmath61 mass @xmath63  mev / c@xmath54 , both about three times the resolution .",
    "events with only the exact number of selected tracks are accepted .",
    "this selection is very efficient , @xmath6499.9% , for events passing all other requirements .",
    "pions are required to have specific ionization , @xmath65 , in the main drift chamber within four standard deviations of the expected value for a real pion at the measured momentum . for kaons and protons , a combined @xmath65 and rich ( ring imaging cherenkov counter ) likelihood",
    "is formed and kaons are required to be more kaon - like than pion- or proton - like , and similarly for protons .",
    "cross feed between hadron species is negligible after all other requirements .    in modes comprising only two charged particles ,",
    "there are some extra cuts to eliminate qed background which produce charged leptons in the final state .",
    "events are rejected if the sum over all the charged tracks produces a penetration into the muon system of more than five nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "events are rejected if any track has @xmath66 and it has a @xmath65 consistent with an electron .",
    "this latter cut is not used for @xmath67 modes because anti - protons tend to deposit all their energy in the calorimeter .",
    "these cuts are essentially 100% efficient for the signal , and ensure this qed background is negligible .",
    "the efficiencies averaged over the cleo  iii and cleo - c data sets for each mode including the branching fractions @xmath46 , @xmath48 , and @xmath68  @xcite are given in tables  [ tab : brfits0]-[tab : brfits2 ] for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 respectively .",

    "we approximate the resolution with a single gaussian distribution , and variations are considered in the determination of systematic uncertainty .",

    "this fit has a good probability of matching the data , 73% , and agrees with fits done to the separate dalitz plots not taking advantage of isospin symmetry .",
    "the addition of a @xmath69 contribution does not improve the fit probability and the amplitude @xmath70 is statistically significant only at the four standard deviation level .",
    "similar behavior is noted for a non - resonant contribution .",
    "systematic uncertainties are evaluated by observing deviations from the nominal fit as described above for the @xmath13 analysis . when systematics are taken into account",
    "neither the @xmath69 nor non - resonant contribution has a fit fraction significant at the three standard deviation level .",
    "their individual contributions are limited to less than roughly 10% of the dalitz plot .",
    "these observations are consistent with those by bes  @xcite in the @xmath11 mode .    while this model of the contributions to the dalitz plots gives a good description of the data it is clearly incomplete .",
    "there should be interference among the resonances , which the simple approach of equation  [ eqn : sumofresonances ] does not take into account . to quantify the effect of interference we have repeated the dalitz analyses using a `` quasi - coherent '' ( note that @xmath71 is always positively - defined ) sum of amplitudes with floating complex weighting factors instead of @xmath72 .",
    "this causes the fit fractions to change by as much as @xmath7320% absolutely in the @xmath74 analysis and @xmath7315% absolutely in the @xmath75 analysis . with more data a study of the @xmath3 decay substructure taking into account the effect of @xmath3 polarization , using the orientation of the @xmath3 decay plane with respect to the @xmath3 flight direction , in a partial wave analysis would be a complete description of these decays .",

    "similarly for @xmath79 our results are summarized in table  [ tab : kkpidalitz ] , assuming , based on isospin , that the @xmath80 and @xmath9 plots are identical .",

    "in order to constrain amplitudes and phases in @xmath3 decays we use a clebsch - gordan decomposition of the @xmath3 ( the state with @xmath85 ) for possible isospin subsystems : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 below we use the clebsch - gordan decomposition rules , @xmath89 from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath91 mesons with i=1/2 form two isodoublets : ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) with ( @xmath96,@xmath97 ) respectively .",
    "the clebsch - gordan decomposition rules for @xmath98 isospin states are :                combining equations  [ eqn : case_a ] and [ eqn : case_b ] with equations  [ eqn : kstar+]-[eqn : kstar- ] we get @xmath110               - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\bigg [ ( \\pi^0k^+)k^- + ( \\pi^0k^0)\\overline{k}^0 \\bigg],\\ ] ] @xmath111               - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\bigg [ ( \\pi^0k^-)k^+ + ( \\pi^0\\overline{k}^0)k^0 \\bigg].\\ ] ] assuming charge symmetry the amplitudes in equations  [ eqn : case_a_fs ] and [ eqn : case_b_fs ] should be equal . from these equations",
    "we get the ratio of rates : @xmath112 @xmath113 or their sum @xmath114      for @xmath116 modes we use the @xmath117 rule : @xmath118 for @xmath119 we use the @xmath120 rules : @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 combining equation  [ eqn : case_c_intermediate ] with equations  [ eqn : case_a+]-[eqn : case_a- ] we get          comparing equations  [ eqn : case_rate_r1]-[eqn : case_width ] for intermediate states with @xmath91 and equations  [ eqn : case_rate_r1_for_a0]-[eqn : case_width_for_a0 ] for intermediate states with @xmath128 , we note that they are identical .",
    "thus observations of @xmath129 and charge conjugated @xmath130 final states on the same dalitz plot will yield the certain ratio between @xmath91 and @xmath128 amplitudes for the @xmath80 dalitz plot . the same ratio between @xmath91 and @xmath128 amplitudes",
    "is expected for the @xmath9 dalitz plot .",
    "this isospin analysis implies that these two dalitz plots , @xmath80 and @xmath9 , can be parametrized using a common set of parameters for each @xmath91 and @xmath128 intermediate state . from equations  [ eqn :",
    "case_a_fs ] , [ eqn : case_b_fs ] we can write equations between decay amplitudes with @xmath91 mesons @xmath131 @xmath132 where the signs assume equal phases @xmath133 similar equations between amplitudes with @xmath134 can be obtained from equation  [ eqn : case_c ] @xmath135 @xmath136 assuming equal phases @xmath137 equations  [ eqn : ampl_kstar ] and [ eqn : ampl_a0_980 ] predict that the ratio of amplitudes between these two dalitz plots is @xmath138 .",
    "this relative factor does not matter , because each dalitz plot is normalized separately . in the combined fit",
    "we ignore this @xmath138 factor between the amplitudes in the @xmath80 and @xmath9 dalitz plots , and use common fit parameters for each of @xmath139 mesons and @xmath134 intermediate states @xmath140 @xmath141 in sections  [ ref : kk_i1 ] and [ ref : kpi_i05 ] we have checked an isospin symmetry between @xmath142 and @xmath9 decays for two particular intermediate states .",
    "however , this symmetry is valid independently of how the amplitudes are decomposed into two - body sub - amplitudes , and thus should be valid for all points on the dalitz plot .",
