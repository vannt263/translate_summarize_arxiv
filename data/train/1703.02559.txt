    "the study of the quantum to classical correspondence in dissipative systems is attracting a lot of attention nowadays .",
    "this is related to its relevance for many different fields that range from the theoretical aspects of quantum information @xcite to applications such as in cold atoms @xcite .",
    "there is a new body of work that asks for a better understanding of the interplay between the classical and quantum properties of dissipation .",
    "we can mention the developments in reservoir engineering , which has been applied to generate robust quantum states in the presence of decoherence @xcite , for example .",
    "optomechanics @xcite is also revealing as a promising field where our knowledge of the many intricate features of the route to chaos , so deeply investigated in classical systems , needs to be extended to the quantum arena . very recently",
    ", interesting properties of many body systems have been elucidated @xcite , and the corresponding classical equations could bring a whole new perspective when analyzed in terms of the signatures they imprint on the original quantum systems . a rocked open bose - hubbard dimer has shown a non trivial connection between the interactions and bifurcations in the mean field dynamics . then , it is of the utmost importance to clarify any details that could be controversial .    in this line",
    ", attention has been directed towards the effects of the monitoring ( coupling ) details on the emergence or suppression of chaos @xcite . moreover , an apparent paradox regarding regular quantum behaviour corresponding to a classical chaotic one in an optomechanical system has been nicely explained thanks to studies undertaken from the correspondence perspective @xcite . finally , it was recently claimed that quantum chaotic attractors ( i.e. complex quantum equilibrium states typically associated to classical chaotic attractors ) with no classical counterpart exist in the open dissipative quantum duffing system @xcite .    in order to throw light over some of these features we study two paradigmatic systems : a dissipative modified kicked rotator map ( dmkrm ) which has been very fruitful in directed transport theory @xcite , and a dissipative periodically driven dynamical system ( dpdds ) that has applications in isomerization reactions @xcite and which is fundamental to support the generic nature of our ideas .",
    "we concentrate on the case of a small but finite value of the effective planck constant @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that by suitably exploring the parameter space of these systems we are always able to find a classical chaotic attractor corresponding to any quantum chaotic one , even when the classical dynamics is regular ( we propose a general way to do it ) .",
    "for the exceptional cases where no chaotic region is near the regular one in this space , the quantum limiting distributions become also regular ( within quantum uncertainty ) .",
    "the addition of gaussian noise of size @xmath0 to the classical equations provides with the main features of the quantum evolution .",
    "the study of a generic system , beyond kicked ones , has been fundamental to extend the validity of these conjectures @xcite    we have organized our paper in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the models including the way the extra gaussian noise is added to the classical versions in order to find the quantum behaviour . the methods to integrate the equations",
    "are also explained . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we explore several key values of the parameters in order to show our main point , i.e. that a classical analog can always be found for quantum chaotic attractors .",
    "also , we explain the exceptional cases where point like quantum distributions exist . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we conclude .",
    "the first model we consider is a particle moving in one dimension [ @xmath2 periodically kicked by the potential : @xmath3 \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\delta(t - m \\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the strength of each kick and @xmath5 is the kicking period . when adding dissipation we obtain the following map @xcite @xmath6 \\\\",
    "\\overline{x}=x+ \\tau \\overline{n}. \\end{array } \\right . \\label{dissmap}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the momentum variable conjugated to @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the dissipation parameter .",
    "the conservative limit is reached at @xmath11 , whereas the value @xmath12 gives the maximum damping . in order to simplify the parametric dependence it is usual to introduce a rescaled momentum variable @xmath13 and the quantity @xmath14 .",
    "this is a paradigmatic model in directed transport . as such it shows a current that emerges as a consequence of breaking the spatial and temporal symmetries ( when @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we take @xmath18 and @xmath19 for this work .",
    "some of us have conjectured @xcite that the main effects of the quantum fluctuations are similar to those of gaussian fluctuations of the order of @xmath0 induce in the classical map ( we define the effective planck constant @xmath0 in the next paragraph ) . in order to introduce them we replace the first line of eq .",
    "[ dissmap ] with @xmath20 + \\xi$ ] .",
    "we have chosen to leave no free parameters in order to test the behaviour of our conjecture in this situation , so we fix @xmath21 , having zero mean .",
    "however , the exact coincidence of the size of fluctuations with @xmath0 is not essential for it to be valid .    the quantum model ( without noise )",
    "is obtained via : @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . since @xmath25=i \\tau$ ] ( where @xmath26 ) , the effective planck constant is @xmath27 .",
    "the classical limit corresponds to @xmath28 , while @xmath29 remains constant .",
    "dissipation at the quantum level is introduced by means of the master equation @xcite for the density operator @xmath30 of the system @xmath31 - \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\mu=1}^2 \\{\\hat{l}_{\\mu}^{\\dag } \\hat{l}_{\\mu},\\hat{\\rho}\\}+ \\sum_{\\mu=1}^2 \\hat{l}_{\\mu } \\hat{\\rho } \\hat{l}_{\\mu}^{\\dag } \\equiv \\lambda \\rho . \\label{lindblad}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the system hamiltonian , \\ { , } is the anticommutator , and @xmath33 are the lindblad operators given by @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 to comply with the ehrenfest theorem .      in order to give a more general support to our claims we have chosen to study a full dynamical system that can be thought as a particle moving in the continuously driven time periodic potential    @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the strength of the time periodic forcing . throughout this paper",
    "we take @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the picture is completed by means of a velocity dependent damping and gaussian fluctuations that are usually taken as thermal ones , but that in our present study will play the same role as in the previous model , i.e. reproducing the main effects of quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus , we are led to numerically solve the equation    @xmath40    as usual , @xmath8 stands for the spatial coordinate of the particle , @xmath41 for its mass ( we take @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 is the amount of dissipation .",
    "again , in a way similar to the dmkrm case , the gaussian white noise having zero mean @xmath44 is simply asked to satisfy @xmath45 .",
    "this system is interesting to simulate a molecule with two stable isomers that is under the influence of a monochromatic laser field pulse , for which the term @xmath46 represents the dipole coupling @xcite .",
    "but it is also of general nature , and the results obtained through its study can be directly applied to many different situations , including for example many body systems @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical evolution is performed by means of a modified split operator method @xcite .",
    "in fact , we compose unitary steps given by the kinetic and potential terms of the hamiltonian , and other purely dissipative ones . in order to treat these",
    "latter we use the same model as in the previous subsection . for the sake of completeness",
    "we explicitly write down the dissipative part of the lindblad equation for the density matrix of this system , that can be written as a completely positive map @xmath47 in the operator - sum or kraus representation    @xmath48    where    @xmath49    can be interpreted as infinitesimal kraus operators obeying the rule @xmath50 to first order in @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath52 as the momentum variable , conjugated to the @xmath8 coordinate .",
    "in fact , the two different operators denoted by the superscript @xmath53 are associated to the positive and negative values of the @xmath52 spectrum .",
    "it is important to notice that in this case @xmath54 is the system - bath coupling parameter and can be directly associated to the classical friction parameter @xmath43 .",
    "also , @xmath43 is taken differently from @xmath9 in the dmkrm since in generic dynamical systems @xmath55 corresponds to the dissipation - less regime , while in kicked systems @xmath12 stands for the maximum damping .",
    "the main tools used for our investigation are the liouville and husimi @xcite limiting distributions of our systems . for the dmkrm we have evolved @xmath56 random initial conditions in the @xmath57 $ ] band of the cylindrical phase space in the classical case ( unless otherwise mentioned ) . for the quantum version we use the husimi distribution of the evolved initial density matrix corresponding to these classical initial conditions . a very simple way to see",
    "the chaoticity or simplicity of these sets is by means of the participation ratio @xmath58 .",
    "this measure has its origin as a good indicator of the fraction of basis elements that effectively expand the quantum state .",
    "we have extended it to the classical case .",
    "the corresponding @xmath59 is calculated by taking a discretized @xmath52 distribution after @xmath60 time steps , which we have verified is enough to reach a reasonable convergence .",
    "the number of bins is given by the hilbert space dimension used in the quantum calculations , in our case is @xmath61 .",
    "it is clear that a finer coarse - graining would slightly change the classical @xmath59 distributions but this will not affect their main properties .",
    "this is because the distance among points of the simple limit cycles is almost always greater than the chosen bin size .",
    "the quantum equilibrium distribution is obtained in a few periods , and we have taken @xmath62 .",
    "we have explored the parameter space of the dmkrm in a relevant region where many regular isoperiodic stable structures ( isss @xcite , originally termed as periodicity hubs @xcite ) appear .",
    "they are characterized by low values of @xmath59 and can be noticed as the clear areas with sharp borders in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "when adding a uniform gaussian noise of size @xmath63 , the resulting @xmath59 can be observed in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) .",
    "if we accept that this is a good measure of the quantum behaviour , it is clear that chaoticity is the rule while very few parameter sets correspond to point like structures .",
    "when noise of the size of @xmath0 is added the parameter space suffers a deep transition and just a couple of regions associated to the largest of these isss keep their simplicity .",
    "this behaviour could seem paradoxical , and ( for low dissipation values ) apparently be of strictly quantum nature , implying that _ purely _ quantum chaotic attractors could exist without classical counterparts .",
    "but , can the quantum behaviour be completely disconnected from the classical behaviour of surrounding structures in parameter space in some cases ? the explorations are usually done with the aid of a typical bifurcation diagram but if we see the whole parameter space things become clearer . for a representative example of an apparently purely quantum chaotic attractor we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the phase space is dominated by a period three limit cycle which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ( we take @xmath66 ) .",
    "if we add noise of size @xmath63 a classical chaotic attractor develops , induced precisely by it and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ( in this case we have considered @xmath67 random initial conditions with @xmath57 $ ] , and accumulated their evolution over the last @xmath68 periods , from a total of @xmath60 ) . the similarity with the quantum distribution shown in fig . [ fig1](f ) is remarkable .",
    "but this is not all , if we explore the parameter space in the orthogonal direction to @xmath9 ( which is the one typically explored in bifurcation diagrams ) , we notice that classical chaotic regions are very near , as it is the case for the overwhelming majority of regular regions that are embedded in them . in this case , for @xmath69 and @xmath65 we have found a classical chaotic attractor that closely resembles the previous chaotic distributions ( both classical with noise and quantum ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) ) .",
    "we define the overlap @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are normalized phase space distributions with the same discretization .",
    "we have calculated @xmath73 between the classical distribution with noise of fig . [",
    "fig1](d ) and both , the quantum distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) obtaining @xmath74 , and the quantum chaotic attractor corresponding to the classical one of fig .",

    "( b ) we show the same quantity when we add gaussian noise of the size of @xmath63 . in ( c )",
    "we show the limit cycle of period three that dominates the phase space at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while in ( d ) the classical distribution obtained by adding noise corresponding to @xmath63 . in ( e ) we show a classical chaotic attractor ( noiseless system ) that is found by moving in the @xmath4 direction ( @xmath9 fixed ) for @xmath69 and @xmath65 . in",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the details of @xmath59 for different lines along @xmath4 and @xmath9 , in order to give a more precise explanation of the previous argument . if we move from @xmath64 , while keeping @xmath65 we can see that the chaoticity of distributions grows .",
    "in particular , it is the kind of dynamics that dominates for greater @xmath4 up to @xmath76 , but also for some lower @xmath4 values ( see fig . [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "moreover , if we add gaussian noise of size @xmath63 the intermittency gets washed out as can be noticed by the monotonicity of the ( blue ) line with circles , with the only exception of the largest regular regions . for comparison purposes",
    "we also show the @xmath77 case where again , the exceptionally large regular region fails to be completely smoothed out by the gaussian fluctuations as can be seen from the deep fall in the ( red ) line with down triangles .",
    "we now come to fig . [ fig2](b ) where we explore the parameter space in the direction of @xmath9 .",
    "if we fix @xmath64 and go from @xmath65 to lower values , which means increasing the coupling with the environment or equivalently increasing dissipation , we have a long way to go before arriving to a chaotic region .",

    "we study the classical and quantum limiting distributions in a stroboscopic surface of section taken at integer multiples of one period of the forcing . for the dpdds we have evolved @xmath68 random initial conditions in the @xmath57 $ ] band ( we take @xmath78 ) of the cylindrical phase space up to @xmath79 periods , in the classical case .",
    "the liouville distributions were obtained by accumulating the points of the last @xmath62 periods ( unless otherwise noted ) .",
    "this assured a reasonable convergence for this systems that is more numerically demanding to solve than the dmkrm .",
    "again , for the quantum version we use the husimi distribution of the evolved initial density matrix corresponding to these classical initial conditions . in this case , the equilibrium distribution is obtained within a few periods ( we have taken @xmath62 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , it can already be seen that the morphology of the parameter space is quite similar to the one of the dmkrm .",
    "in fact , we can identify isss all over it , with their typical _ antenna _ like features which give them the _ shrimps _ familiar name .",
    "we can also find a larger regular structure to the right side that is the only partially surviving one when adding noise of the size of @xmath80 ( see fig . [",

    "[ fig3](c ) we show a period one limit cycle that could be a representative case for a possible purely quantum chaotic attractor located at the low dissipation region , i.e. for @xmath64 and @xmath81 ( remember that in the dpdds the dissipation parameter reaches the conservative limit when @xmath82 ) . if we look at fig .",

    "for example , if we look at fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we can realize that by going up in the forcing strength @xmath4 ( keeping @xmath81 ) will suffice to find a chaotic region beginning approximately at @xmath87 .",

    "if we add noise the curve closely follows the largest values corresponding to the chaotic regions , so again we do not need to change any parameter to find the corresponding classical analogue of the quantum chaotic attractors . for comparison",

    "this can be seen with the aid of the ( green ) line with squares in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , which in this case happens at approximately @xmath89 . by adding noise we see again how the whole curve rises ( see the ( blue ) line with circles in fig .",

    "but the general way to find a classical corresponding chaotic attractor for a given quantum one would be to follow the shortest overall variation of both parameters in order to reach the chaotic background .",
    "finally , we have verified this same behaviour for several points in parameter space , the ones shown are just representative cases .      the other possibility to find a purely quantum strange attractor would be to look for the biggest isss which can have domains quite far from the chaotic background .",
    "but when the chaos is far away , what do the quantum distributions look like ? in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we analyze one representative example for the dmkrm and in the right one we do the same for the dpdds ( we have verified that the large regular region to which this case belongs extends beyond @xmath90 ) .    the period two limit cycle of fig .",

    "important consequences have been derived from this identification @xcite .",
    "we have studied two paradigmatic systems , namely the dmkrm @xcite , and a generic , continuously driven dpdds @xcite we have found that we can always identify a classical chaotic attractor which corresponds to the quantum one . in general , there are no paradoxes in the quantum to classical correspondence of dissipative systems when we add gaussian fluctuations to the classical counterparts . when chaotic regions are sufficiently far away from a given regular one the quantum mechanical attractor is also regular and the distributions become point like ( with quantum uncertainty ) .",
