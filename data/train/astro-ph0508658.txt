    "during the next decade , two km@xmath7 scale underwater / ice neutrino telescopes will start operation , both in the northern ( nemo / km3net  @xcite ) and southern ( icecube  @xcite ) hemispheres .",
    "theoretical and phenomenological studies of recent years show that the sensitivities of these detectors should allow meaningful probes of different nonthermal galactic and extragalactic source populations in high energy neutrinos ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "tev neutrinos are unique carriers of unambiguous information about hadronic processes in cosmic accelerators .",
    "they are produced in @xmath3 or @xmath4 interactions through the decay of secondary charged pions .",
    "since generally these processes also result in tev @xmath0-rays of a comparable rate , the best candidates to be discovered by planned @xmath8 scale neutrino telescopes are sources of @xmath0-rays with fluxes above 1 tev at the level of @xmath9 .",
    "presently more than three dozens of sources of both galactic and extragalactic origin are established as tev @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "some of them , in particular four galactic objects - rxj1713.7 - 3946 and rxj0852.0 - 4622 ( shell type supernova remnants ) and crab nebula and vela x ( plerions ) , as well as three variable extragalactic ( bl lac ) objects - mrk 421 , mrk 501 , and 1es1959 + 650 , do exhibit persistent or episodic fluxes of tev @xmath0-rays exceeding @xmath10 . thus , if a significant fraction of tev @xmath0-ray fluxes of these sources are of hadronic origin , and the spectra of parent protons extend to pev energies , icecube and nemo / km3net should be able to detect the neutrino counterparts of tev @xmath0-rays .    moreover ,",
    "unlike neutrinos , tev @xmath0-rays are fragile and suffer strong internal and/or external absorption due to interactions with ambient ir / optical photon fields .",
    "therefore , for sources with heavily absorbed tev emission , the chances of detection of counterpart neutrinos could be quite high , even for relatively weak @xmath0-ray sources with a tev flux below @xmath11 . in this regard , the microquasar ls  5039  @xcite recently detected in tev @xmath0-rays by the _ hess _ collaboration  @xcite is of great interest and a promising source also for neutrino astronomy .",
    "in one of the first attempts to classify the potential vhe @xmath0-ray emitters , x - ray binaries were attributed to the category of serendipitous sources , i.e. objects which `` do not have any firm _ a priori _ basis for their selection as candidate vhe @xmath0-ray sources '' @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this very class of objects played a very important role in gamma - ray astronomy , in particular initiating in the 1980s a renewed interest in ground based @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "but ironically , the same sources ultimately raised questions about the credibility of the results from that controversial period of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy . as a result , since the early 1990s x - ray binaries have not been considered as primary targets for vhe @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "this pessimistic view was largely supported also by the belief that x - ray binaries should be treated , first of all , as _ thermal _ sources effectively transforming the gravitational energy of the compact object ( a neutron star or a black hole ) into thermal x - ray emission radiated away by the hot accretion plasma .    after the discovery of galactic sources with relativistic jets dubbed _ microquasars _  @xcite ,",
    "the general view on x - ray binaries has dramatically changed ; the observations of synchrotron radio flares from microquasars demonstrated non - negligible role of particle acceleration ( mev / gev electrons ) in these accretion - driven objects .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0-rays from ls  5039 provides a clear indication that nonthermal phenomena of particle acceleration and radiation in x - ray binaries effectively extend into the tev and , perhaps , also pev energy regimes . in this regard",
    ", many original ideas and models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which were initiated by the early ( wrong ? ) claims of tev and pev signals from cyg x-3 and her x-1 ( for a review see @xcite ) , remain very attractive and applicable , after some modifications , to microquasars as well .",
    "variable tev radiation has been predicted from microquasars in different astrophysical scenarios with involvement of both leptonic  @xcite and hadronic  @xcite interactions .",
    "gamma - rays of leptonic  @xcite and hadronic @xcite origin associated with termination of jets in the interstellar medium are expected also from extended regions surrounding microquasars .",
    "hadronic models are attractive in the sense that they predict , from @xmath1-ray binaries in general , and from microquasars in particular , significant fluxes of both tev @xmath0-rays and neutrinos due to proton - proton , photomeson and photo - disintegration processes that may take place in the wind and/or the atmosphere of the normal star , in the accretion disk , and in the jet ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while the models of production of tev neutrinos demonstrate the feasibility of several different scenarios of particle acceleration and interactions in microquasars , one should not overestimate the prediction power and robustness of calculations of neutrino fluxes based merely on model assumptions such as ( i ) the total nonthermal energy of the source , ( ii ) the efficiency of the particle acceleration , ( iii ) the energy spectrum and the maximum energy of accelerated protons , ( iv ) the efficiency of conversion of proton energy into neutrinos .",
    "obviously , the flux predictions based on many model assumptions and parameters does not guarantee any reliable estimate of neutrino fluxes . while this concerns ( perhaps , with some exceptions ) all astrophysical source populations , in the case of microquasars several model assumptions together result in flux uncertainties as large as orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , in microquasars particles can be boosted to multi - tev energies only if the acceleration proceeds at the theoretically highest possible rates allowed by classical electrodynamics .",
    "it is not obvious , however , that this should work , from first principles , in microquasars .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath0-ray emission from ls  5039 has dramatically changed the status of model predictions .",
    "first of all , the _ hess _ discovery provides the first unambiguous evidence for presence of multi - tev particles in microquasars . below",
    "we demonstrate that if gamma - radiation is produced within the binary system , then ( 2 ) electrons hardly can be accelerated to multi - tev energies to explain the observed tev @xmath0-ray signal , and , therefore , ( 3 ) the parent particles of @xmath0 -rays should be protons or nuclei .",
    "if so , ( 4 ) @xmath0-radiation should be accompanied by tev neutrinos with a production rate comparable to the gamma - ray production rate .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath0-rays suffer unavoidable absorption or cascading , ( 5 ) the flux of neutrinos should significantly exceed the observed flux of @xmath0-rays , and therefore ( 6 ) can be ( marginally ) detectable by the km@xmath7 class high energy neutrino telescopes .",
    "while the _ hess _ discovery of tev @xmath0-ray emission from ls 5039 does support the early theoretical speculations of acceleration of particles in microquasars to tev / pev energies , the reported data do not allow us to relate the @xmath0-ray production region(s ) to specific sites of this complex system . the upper limit on the source angular size of about 50 arcsec  @xcite implies that , for a source distance @xmath12  kpc  @xcite , @xmath0-ray production takes place within a radius @xmath13  pc around ls  5039 .",
    "although the observed flux does not allow an unequivocal conclusion about the variability of the tev source  @xcite , hints have been recently reported  @xcite of a possible correlation of the tev flux with the @xmath14 day orbital period of the binary system .",
    "if confirmed by future observations , this would be an indication that tev @xmath0-rays are produced in a compact region , presumably inside the binary system . in what follows",
    "we will assume that @xmath0-rays are produced within @xmath15 , which automatically implies very strong @xmath16 absorption .",
    "the effect of this absorption should have a strong impact on the detectability of tev neutrinos from this source , provided that detected @xmath0-rays are of hadronic origin .",
    "tev @xmath0-ray production generally requires two components : @xmath17 an _ effective accelerator _ of particles , electrons and/or protons , up to 10 tev and beyond ; @xmath18 an _ effective target _",
    "( converter ) .",
    "while the most likely site for particle acceleration in ls  5039 is the jet , which with a speed @xmath19 and a half - opening angle @xmath20 extends out to 300 mas ( @xmath21 cm )  @xcite , the bulk of @xmath0-rays could be produced both inside and outside the jet .",
    "in particular , relativistic electrons in the jet can be accelerated through internal shocks  @xcite , and consequently high energy @xmath0-rays can be effectively produced through inverse compton scattering  @xcite . however , in the jet of ls  5039 , because of close location of the very luminous companion star , the effects of fast radiative cooling may prevent the electrons from reaching multi - tev energies .",
    "the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is achieved when the acceleration time approaches the cooling time due to radiative ( synchrotron and compton ) losses .",
    "the acceleration time can be presented in a general form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the larmor radius , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the strength of the ambient magnetic field . the parameter @xmath26 characterizes the efficiency of acceleration : in the case of extreme accelerators ( maximum possible acceleration rate allowed by classical electrodynamics ) @xmath27 whereas for shock acceleration in the bohm diffusion regime @xmath28 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for a star with a temperature @xmath29  ev and optical luminosity @xmath30 ,",
    "the energy density of the starlight close to the compact object , @xmath31 , varies between @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the apastron ( @xmath34 ) , and at the periastron ( @xmath35 ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the compton scattering of tev electrons in the field of @xmath36  ev starlight takes place in deep klein - nishina regime . while in the thompson regime ( @xmath37 tev )",
    "the cooling time is inverse proportional to the electron energy , @xmath38 , in the klein - nishina regime the characteristic compton cooling time can be approximated with a good accuracy , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . from @xmath41 one",
    "finds @xmath42^{3.3}~{\\rm tev}. \\label{emax1}\\ ] ] formally , for @xmath43  g the maximum energy of accelerated electrons can exceed 10 tev .",
    "however , for such a large @xmath44-field , the synchrotron losses dominate over the compton losses .",
    "namely , the condition @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the synchrotron cooling time , gives @xmath47 equations  ( [ emax1 ] ) and ( [ emax2 ] ) imply that electrons could be accelerated to energies exceeding 10 tev only in an environment with @xmath48  g and @xmath49 .",
    "such small fields can be realized beyond the binary system , in outer parts of the jet . in this case",
    ", @xmath0-rays can be produced through the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) scenario  @xcite , although the contribution from the external ( starlight ) photons could be still significant even at distances quite far from the binary system .",
    "it was recently argued  @xcite that the inverse compton on starlight can not explain the hard tev @xmath0-ray spectrum , and , therefore , an additional ssc component was proposed to match the _ hess _ data .",
    "however , the ssc model does not solve the major problem associated with the maximum achievable energy of electrons .",
    "in fact , the ssc model requires even higher electron energies than the external compton model .",
    "thus , any evidence of @xmath0-ray production inside the binary system , e.g. detection of a periodic component of tev radiation would be a strong argument in favor of the hadronic origin of these energetic photons .",
    "the extension of hard @xmath0-ray spectrum above several  tev requires acceleration of protons to @xmath50  tev . within the inner parts of the jet , with a radius @xmath51  cm ,",
    "a magnetic field @xmath52 could be sufficient to boost protons up to very high energies .",
    "the maximum energy is determined by the condition @xmath53 , which gives @xmath54 .",
    "although these protons are not sufficiently energetic to interact with the starlight photons , they can trigger photomeson processes on @xmath1-ray photons in the accretion disk .",
    "these interactions may lead to copious production of high energy neutrinos , neutrons , @xmath0-rays and electrons . while neutrons and neutrinos escape the source without significant suppression , the electromagnetic fraction of the energy",
    "is effectively reprocessed , and escape the source mainly in the form of hard @xmath1-rays and low energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "for example , if the luminosity of the accretion disk at uv band exceeds @xmath55 , all @xmath0-rays above several tens of  gev will be converted into @xmath56 pairs before they can leave the source .",
    "hence , the synchrotron radiation of the last generation of electrons will lead to a hard @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath57 extending to @xmath58  mev .",
    "interestingly , observations of ls  5039 performed by the comptel telescope do show  @xcite a statistically significant signal of mev @xmath0-rays with a photon index @xmath59 and a total energy flux between 1 mev and 30 mev of about @xmath60 .",
    "if this radiation is indeed related to ls  5039 , it would imply a pronounced maximum in the spectral energy distribution at the level of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , speculating that this radiation is initiated by photomeson interactions ( of protons with energy @xmath50 tev ) close to the inner part of the accretion disk , one can estimate the expected flux of tev muon neutrinos at the level of @xmath62 , provided that the charged pions decay before interacting with the ambient dense plasma and radiation . in the lab frame ,",
    "the decay time of charged pions responsible for tev neutrino production is @xmath63  s. on the other hand , the cooling time of @xmath2 due to inelastic @xmath64 and @xmath65 interactions depends on the ambient gas @xmath66 and photon @xmath67 densities : @xmath68 s , and @xmath69 s. for typical parameters characterizing ls  5039 , the number density of @xmath1-ray photons and the plasma density in the region",
    "@xmath70  cm do not exceed @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "therefore charged pions decay to @xmath73 and @xmath74 before interacting with the ambient photons and protons .",
    "the production of neutrinos from the subsequent muon decay also proceed with high probability as long as the magnetic field does not exceed @xmath75  g. this follows directly from the comparison of the decay time of muons , @xmath76  s , with their synchrotron cooling time @xmath77  s.    protons can also interact effectively with the ambient cold plasma , close to the base of the jet and/or throughout the entire jet . in what follows",
    "we assume that the base of the jet is located close to the inner parts of the accretion disk , i.e. , the jet axis @xmath78 is taken normal to the orbital plane , with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "if the magnetic field drops as @xmath81 , the condition of the confinement of protons in the jet , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the radius of the jet at a distance @xmath78 , implies @xmath84=constant .",
    "thus , one may expect acceleration of protons to the same maximum energy @xmath85 over the entire jet region .",
    "however , if there is a faster drop of @xmath44 with @xmath78 , the protons at some distance @xmath86 from the compact object will start escaping the jet .",
    "if this happens within the binary system , i.e. @xmath87 , protons interacting with the dense wind of the optical star will result in additional @xmath0-ray and neutrino production outside the jet .",
    "if the jet power is dominated by the kinetic energy of bulk motion of cold @xmath88-@xmath89 plasma , the baryon density of the jet @xmath90 can be estimated from the condition @xmath91 .",
    "the efficiency of @xmath0-ray production in the jet is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the luminosity of vhe @xmath0-rays and @xmath94 is the power of accelerated protons .",
    "here , @xmath95  mb is the cross - section of inelastic @xmath3 interactions , and @xmath96 is the fraction of the energy of the parent proton transfered to a high energy @xmath0-ray photon . given the recent estimate of the black hole mass in ls  5039 @xmath97  @xcite , we set @xmath98 . for the profile of the number density",
    "we adopt a power law - form , @xmath99 where @xmath100 corresponds to a cylindrical geometry , @xmath101 to a conical jet , and @xmath102 is an intermediate case . expressing the acceleration power of protons in terms of the total jet power , @xmath103 , one finds the following requirement for the jet power , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the acceleration efficiency and @xmath106 .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 characterizes the geometry / density profile of the jet . for @xmath108 ,",
    "one has @xmath109 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the case of cylindrical jet provides the highest efficiency of @xmath0-ray production .",
    "however , since @xmath110 ( assuming @xmath111 efficiency of proton acceleration , and taking into account that the fraction of energy of protons converted to @xmath0-rays can not exceed 30% ) the @xmath0-ray production can not be extended beyond @xmath112 .",
    "the case of a conical jet corresponds to the minimum efficiency of @xmath0-ray production , and thus the largest kinetic power of the jet . in this case",
    "the bulk of @xmath0-rays are produced not far from the base .",
    "finally , in the intermediate case , tev @xmath0-rays are produced in equal amounts per decade of length of the jet , until the jet terminates .",
    "if @xmath0-rays are indeed produced in @xmath3 interactions , one would expect production of high energy neutrinos with a rate close to the @xmath0-ray production rate , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 varies between 0.5 and 2 depending on the shape of the proton spectrum .",
    "however , since @xmath0-rays are subject to energy - dependent absorption  @xcite , both the energy spectrum and the absolute flux of neutrinos , @xmath115,$ ] could be quite different from the detected @xmath0-rays , @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "the optical depth @xmath117 depends significantly on the location of the @xmath0-ray production region , and therefore varies with time if this region occupies a small volume of the binary system .",
    "this may lead to time modulation of the energy spectrum and the absolute flux of tev radiation with the orbital period  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath16 interactions generally can not be reduced to a simple effect of absorption .",
    "in fact , these interactions initiate high energy electron - photon cascades , supported by the inverse compton scattering and @xmath16 pair production processes .",
    "the cascades significantly increase the transparency of the source .",
    "the spectra of @xmath0-rays formed during the cascade development significantly differ from the spectrum of @xmath0-rays that suffer only absorption .",

    "curves 1 and 2 correspond two different assumptions on the location of the @xmath0-ray production region in the jet : at @xmath118  cm ( 1 ) , and @xmath119  cm ( 2 ) .",
    "dashed curves correspond to the primary @xmath0-ray injection rates chosen in a way that the calculated cascade spectra match the observed @xmath0-ray flux around 1 tev .",

    "the calculations of the electromagnetic cascade developed in the photon and magnetic field are based on the method similar to the one described in ref @xcite .",
    "because of the orbital motion , both the absolute density and the angular distribution of the thermal radiation of the star relative to the the position of the compact object ( microquasar ) vary with time . in the calculations we take into account the effect of the anisotropic ( time - dependent ) distribution of target photons on the compton scattering and pair - production cross - sections @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig ] we show the @xmath0-ray spectra averaged over the orbital period .    the solid curves show the cascade spectra , the dotted curves are the spectra of @xmath0-rays which the observer would see due to the pure absorption effect ( i.e. in the case of effective suppression of the cascade ) , and the dashed curves indicate the injection spectra .",
    "two different locations of @xmath0-ray production region have been assumed : ( _ i _ ) close to the base of the jet @xmath120  cm , and ( _ ii _ ) well above the base of the jet , @xmath119  cm .",
    "all curves are averaged over the orbital period of the system , taking into account the recent data concerning the geometry of the system  @xcite .",
    "the cascade spectra are normalized to the reported range of tev fluxes .",
    "they correspond to the production rate ( luminosity ) of @xmath121  tev @xmath0-rays between @xmath122 ( corresponding to the dashed curve  2 for @xmath123 kpc ) and @xmath124 ( dashed curve  1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig ] shows that the cascade @xmath0-rays calculated for @xmath118  cm agree quite reasonably with the low energy ( mev / gev ) data as well , given the large statistical uncertainties and the fact that the egret and _ hess _ observations are from different epochs .",
    "since muon neutrinos should be produced with about the same rate as tev @xmath0-rays , the dashed curves can be used to estimate the neutrino flux expected from the source : @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the cases ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) , respectively . the flux of neutrinos",
