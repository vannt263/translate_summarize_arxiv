    "dust alters the conditions of the diffuse medium , e.g. it provides a dominant heating mechanism via photo - electric heating  @xcite . so understanding the size distribution is important for modeling the diffuse interstellar medium of which the local bubble is an example .",
    "extinction measurements give information about the size distribution of grains in the diffuse medium and hints at their composition  @xcite .",
    "the extinction curve can be fitted by a mixture of graphite and silicate grains with a power - law size distribution ( mrn distribution ) @xmath0 in the interval @xmath1 with an exponent of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this optically active population can explain all depletions  @xcite .",
    "no larger grains , that are optically gray , are needed .",
    "interstellar dust was first detected in situ by the dust detector on board the spaceprobe ulysses in 1992 after jupiter flyby  @xcite .",
    "the detector , that is identical to the one on board the galileo spaceprobe , is an impact charge detector and measures the mass , impact velocity , and impact direction of the impacting grain as described by grn et al .",
    "the finding was confirmed by the data collected by the galileo dust detector .",
    "galileo reached jupiter in december 1995 where planetary dust is dominant , so the galileo measurements range from mid 1993 , when galileo left the inner solar system , to the end of 1995 .",
    "ulysses dust data is available up to march 1996 .",
    "the criteria to identify interstellar impacts in both ulysses and galileo data were given by baguhl et al .",
    "the impact rate measured by ulysses is @xmath3 which translates into a flux of @xmath4 .",
    "interstellar grains provide the dominant dust flux in the outer solar system .",
    "analysis of the directional information  @xcite indicates a stream of grains entering the solar system from a direction that is compatible with the upstream direction of interstellar helium  @xcite .",
    "the grains detected _ in situ _ are larger than the ones needed to explain the extinction curve .",
    "we check if the mass distribution is just an extrapolation of the mrn population , ignoring the fact that this would contradict cosmic abundance considerations  @xcite . to avoid binning effects",

    "fig.[disfuncs ] shows the cumulative mass distribution of all particles detected by ulysses and galileo together with the power - law fit to masses larger than @xmath8 , where the distribution was not altered by filtration as described by levy and jokipii ( 1976 ) .",
    "the fit is weighted to match the points with good statistics .",
    "an exponent of @xmath9 fits the data best with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is well below the @xmath12-limit of @xmath13 for @xmath14 degrees of freedom .",
    "due to bad statistics for grains with large masses , the fit is not too sensitive , but indicates a steeper slope than the mrn extrapolation .",

    "we compare the _ in situ _ distribution to the distribution fitted to extinction measurements by kim et al .",
    "since extinction is measured along long lines of sight through the diffuse medium and _ in situ _ measurements are very local compared to this , one has to be careful interpreting this comparison .",
    "the fits to extinction measurements rely on a dust model with a size distribution and different grain compositions .",
    "kim et al . ( 1994 ) give the mass per logarithmic size interval normalized to the mass of hydrogen in the same volume as shown in fig.[masssize ] ( a ) assuming the canonical value of @xmath18 for the gas density in the diffuse medium .",
    "we calculate the _ size _ distribution @xmath19 from the _ mass _ distribution given in sect.[fluxfit ] by assuming homogeneous , spherical grains with a bulk density of @xmath20  @xcite . from the size distribution",
    "the differential mass distribution per logarithmic size interval @xmath21 , which is identical to the function given by kim et al . is calculated .",
    "the comparison of fig.[masssize ] ( a ) with fig.[masssize ] ( b ) shows , that the _ in situ _ distribution does not reproduce the steep dropoff fitted to the extinction measurements .",
    "the _ in situ _ distributions show , that there is much mass in grains larger than @xmath22 .",
    "we have shown that the existence of big ( @xmath23 ) interstellar grains is evident . if the size distribution of small grains is extrapolated to larger sizes as was indicated by fig.[masssize ] ( b ) , this will lead to dust - to - gas mass ratios of more than the canonical value of @xmath24 , because @xmath24 is already used up by mrn grains and larger grains contribute even more to the overall mass assuming the mrn extrapolation .",
    "dust - to - gas mass ratios larger than @xmath24 contradict cosmic abundances  @xcite . by integration of the distribution shown in fig.[masssize ] ( b ) , the contribution of the in situ measured particles to the dust - to - gas mass ratio is determined to be @xmath25 .",

    "if the dust in the lic has been shocked in the past , than there should be much more smaller grains , and if not , the dust has to be younger than the typical time - scale for returning the dust mass into the gas phase by supernova shocks which is @xmath26  @xcite ."
