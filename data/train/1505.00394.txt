    "after the discovery of the gauge - gravity duality  @xcite , anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime has attracted significant interest in both the gravity and high energy physics community .",
    "asymptotically ads space - times exhibit a number of characteristic features which are absent in asymptotically flat or de sitter spacetimes .",
    "one of such key features is the occurrence of particular types of instability , such as weakly turbulent instability  @xcite and superradiant instability  @xcite  ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , in which the ads boundary plays a crucial role as a confining box .",
    "it is clearly important to consider consequences  in particular , possible final states  of such instabilities .",
    "consider , for example , superradiant instability of a rotating ads black hole with angular velocity @xmath2 .",
    "suppose a monochromatic wave of the form @xmath3 falls into the black hole .",
    "if @xmath4<k \\ , \\omega$ ] , then such an incident wave gets amplified by the black hole rotation and reflected at ads infinity towards the black hole where it again gets amplified , and the process repeats . it was suggested that the end point of this superradiant instability may be a rotating black hole which admits only one killing vector field  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the possibility of such a less symmetric black hole was first suggested in @xcite in the context of asymptotically flat black holes in higher dimensions .",
    "motivated by this , rotating black hole solutions with complex scalar hair that break axial symmetry were numerically constructed  @xcite .",
    "the proposed solutions are , however , not completely satisfactory in the sense that although the scalar field configuration is indeed invariant only under one killing vector field , the metric itself admits more than one killing vector field .    in this paper",
    ", we address this issue in a three - dimensional setup and construct , for the first time , a rotating ads black hole whose metric possesses only a single killing vector field . for this purpose ,",
    "we first consider scalar field perturbation of a rotating btz black hole  @xcite , which is the simplest model of rotating ads black holes .",
    "when the mass - squared of the scalar field takes a certain negative value , we can impose , rather than the dirichlet condition , more general boundary conditions at ads infinity under which the rotating btz black hole exhibits instabilities .",
    "next , by inspecting quasi - normal modes of the scalar field , we identify the marginally stable btz solution . then , based on that , we perturbatively construct a rotating ads black hole whose metric possesses only one killing vector field .",
    "interestingly , we find that the total energy of our _ lumpy _ black hole is lower than that of the btz black hole with the same entropy and the angular momentum .",
    "this in turn implies that our hairy black hole is entropically more favorable than the background btz black hole with the same mass and angular momentum .",
    "consider the three - dimensional model with lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the ads scale , @xmath7 the einstein - hilbert term , and @xmath8 a real scalar field with some constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the absence of the real scalar field ,",
    "our model  ( [ action_sc ] ) admits a rotating btz black hole  @xcite with the metric @xmath11 where the outer horizon and the infinity ( _ i.e. , _ boundary ) are located at @xmath12 and @xmath13 as in  @xcite , and @xmath14 is the angular coordinate with period @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denotes the outer  ( inner ) horizon radius .    making the ansatz @xmath17\\cos ( \\omega t - k\\varphi)$ ] and for the meantime setting @xmath18",
    ", we find the general solution for @xmath19 on the background  ( [ metric_btz ] ) expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function  @xcite , @xmath20 imposing an ingoing boundary condition on the horizon , we set @xmath21 .",
    "then , with the help of @xcite , the asymptotic behavior is given by @xmath22 where we have set @xmath23 .",
    "the breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound  @xcite corresponds to the case @xmath24 . in the range @xmath25 ,",
    "both the modes are normalizable near the infinity and therefore we can impose a more general boundary condition at infinity given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 being some constant .",
    "such a more general boundary condition corresponds to adding a double - trace interaction @xmath28 to the dual field theory  @xcite , where @xmath29 is an operator dual to @xmath8 .",
    "we will see later that the total energy defined in an appropriate manner  @xcite is indeed conserved .",
    "therefore , in the present context , there is nothing wrong with imposing such a more general boundary condition .",
    "now we are concerned with the behavior of quasi normal modes , which can be computed by fixing the geometric parameters , say @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath6 , and by imposing the ingoing condition at the horizon and our more general boundary condition at infinity . for the purpose of numerical computation below , let us set @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and choose @xmath27 as the following particular value : @xmath35 in this setup , we compute quasi normal modes @xmath36 and plot some of our results in fig .  1 .    , while the vertical line represents @xmath37 .",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath34 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . ]",
    "note that the outer horizon radius @xmath40 ( and thus the angular velocity @xmath41 ) also varies depending on the value of @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , we can find that when @xmath43 , @xmath42 becomes real and equal to @xmath44 as shown in fig .  1 , and also that there is no flux across the horizon .",
    "in fact , to achieve this , we have purposely chosen the particular value of @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) .",
    "thus the rotating btz black holes become unstable under our more general boundary condition against modes with @xmath45 shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , the solution with @xmath43 and @xmath34 can be viewed as the marginally stable solution .",
    "this is not the case under the standard dirichlet boundary conditions  @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that the btz background admits a killing vector field which is causal everywhere outside the event horizon , and therefore there would not be superradiant instability in the standard sense , according to the argument of @xcite",
    ". however note also that our model violates the dominat energy condition and thus the agument of @xcite does not straightforwardly apply to the present case . since our unstable modes @xmath45 appear only when @xmath46 , i.e. , the standard superradiant condition is apparently satisfied as can be seen in fig .  1",
    ", we loosely call our instability `` superradiant instability '' in the rest of the paper .",
    "having obtained the marginally stable solution , we can expect that there should exist a hairy black hole solution dressed with a condensed real scalar field .",
    "we perturbatively construct such a hairy black hole solution by expanding the metric functions and scalar field in a series of small amplitude @xmath0 of the scalar field , up to @xmath1 , starting from our marginal solution .    in the probe limit of the scalar field , where the backreaction onto the spacetime is ignored",
    ", @xmath8 depends on the coordinate @xmath47 and @xmath48 only , we expect that the resultant hairy black hole also depends only on @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we make the metric ansatz as @xmath50 where @xmath51 on the horizon @xmath12 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath8 and the metric functions , collectively denoted by @xmath52 , can be expanded as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and the leading term of @xmath55 respectively denote the corresponding values of the marginal btz black hole .",
    "( remember that we have set @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . )",
    "we require the following asymptotic conditions for the metric functions , @xmath59 and the condition  ( [ kappa ] ) for @xmath8 . near the horizon , the scalar curvature @xmath7 becomes @xmath60 . to remove the singularity on the horizon , we require @xmath61 where @xmath62 is in fact independent of @xmath63 as well , thus a true constant as can be seen in eq .",

    "in this paper , aiming at constructing a rotating black hole whose metric admits only a single killing vector field , we have investigated three - dimensional ads black holes with a real scalar field .",
    "first we showed that under our more general boundary condition , the scalar field perturbation shows instabilities .",
    "then we have constructed rotating hairy black holes perturbatively with respect to the scalar perturbation amplitude , @xmath0 , from the onset of the instability , up to @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the entropy of our hairy black hole is larger than the one of btz , with the same energy and the angular momentum .",
    "judging merely from this entropically favored nature , one might expect our hairy black hole to be a possible final fate of superradiant instability in ads@xmath164 .",
    "however , since our solution is constructed perturbatively , there is a possibility that once non - linear effects are fully taken into account , some new unstable modes might show up .",
    "also we should mention that under our general boundary condition , the background ads@xmath164 itself turns out to be unstable : one can check that our boundary condition @xmath165 violates the linear stability criterion established in  @xcite ( see eq .  ( 169 ) in that reference ) , which in the present case ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) reads off @xmath168 in particular , the @xmath167 mode appears to be a dominant unstable mode over other non - axisymmetric @xmath169 unstable modes . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sec_phi ] ) , the equations of motion for higher order perturbations include a source term that consists only of higher ( odd - number @xmath170 ) modes .",
    "this implies that if there is no zero mode in the initial data for our perturbations , the zero mode would not be excited by higher order effects .",
    "having such an unstable property , our hairy black hole may have some interesting applications in the context of holographic superconductor  @xcite , in which the most dangerous @xmath167 mode of our ads background would be irrelevant ( or stabilized ) due to , e.g. , lattice structure .",
    "it would be interesting to pursue this possibility .",
    "the most striking feature of our solution is that lumpy geometry oscillates periodically and co - rotate with the black hole accompanied by the non - linear scalar perturbations .",
    "although it is not strictly thermodynamically equilibrium , the system never dissipates  @xcite , i.e. , the entropy is always constant .",
    "this is in contrast to the solutions of refs .",
    "@xcite , which actually show dissipation . in this sense",
    ", our solution may be viewed as an extension of the time - periodic solutions of  @xcite to the case with a black hole added .",
    "it would also be interesting to generalize the present analysis to higher dimensions .",
