    "the focus in this paper is put on trading in ` lit ' and dark pools .",
    "we study how an investor s optimal trading programme is affected by the availability of a dark pool as an alternative venue with its own set rules . since the trade execution price in the dark pool is related to the best bid and ask prices in the standard exchange ( often referred to as the ` lit ' pool or ` lit ' exchange ) , we propose at the same time novel microstructure models for the price dynamics in the lit exchange . in this paper",
    "we assume the exchange to be an order - driven market and put forward continuous - time models for the best bid price and for the bid - ask spread .",
    "the mid - price is of course recovered by adding half the spread to the best bid price .",
    "we capture the permanent price impact by market activity in the drift function and in the poisson random measures .",
    "the spread process is constructed similarly so as to obtain the same structure for the best ask price when compared to the best bid price process .",

    "other advantages of trading in a dark pool include ( i ) the possibility of submitting large orders without impacting the market price , and ( ii ) trading at more favourable conditions  the dark pool trading price lies between the best bid and the best ask prices quoted in the standard exchange .",
    "( for simplicity , we will assume that the dark pool utilises the standard exchange mid - price . ) on the other hand , dark pools do not guarantee execution of the trade for it is subject to the availability of a trade counterparty .",
    "dark pools might also reduce market liquidity since large and institutional investors , in order to protect private information , resort to these alternative trading venues where orders remain hidden to the general market participants .",
    "most of the research effort in dark pools has been devoted to the impact of dark pools on market welfare .",
    "a game - theoretic approach has often been used to model the two competing trading venues , so to find equilibrium prices and optimal strategies of the market players , also including the effect of private information and adverse selection on trading .",

    "they model the lob mid - price by an exogenous square - integrable martingale and regard the dark pool as a complete - or - zero - execution venue where the arrival of trading counterparties follows a poisson process . in this context",

    "the goal in this paper is to find the optimal trading strategy when utilising standard exchange and the services of a dark pool . since the smoothness of the value function",
    "is not guaranteed on the whole domain , there are no classical solutions to the optimisation problem , in general .",
    "therefore we resort to a weaker notion , the viscosity solutions , and we show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman partial integro differential equation ( hjb pide ) associated with the optimisation problem . there is a vast literature on the theory of viscosity solution of hjb equations of which state variables are driven by general markov processes .",
    "we here refer in particular to pham @xcite , and fleming and soner @xcite for technical details .",
    "our results concerning the exchange are coherent with the ones obtained by chevalier et al",
    "indeed we find that the optimal strategy depends on the book s dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we show that this is also the case in the presence of a dark pool .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : after the introduction , in section [ eq : exchange ] we discuss the optimal trading problem and present our lob model . then we formulate the optimisation problem when only standard exchanges are available to an investor .",

    "we propose an objective function that accounts for trading in the alternative pool and obtain the associated hjb pide . in section [ eq : numerics ] , we provide two numerical examples of the optimal strategy and we focus on the roles played by the parameters of the explicit model .",
    "we conclude with section [ sect.conc ] by summarising the contributions offered in this paper . in order",
    "for the present work to be self - contained , we collect the mathematical conditions , the propositions and the related proofs at the basis of the viscosity property of the value function in the appendix .",

    "is concerned  which in our setup involves the submission of market sell orders only  it suffices to model the best bid ( or the best ask in the case of an optimal acquisition ) , since we consider a temporary price impact to account for the slippage effect . in the short run , the best bid price at time @xmath3 $ ]",

    "we consider positive jumps which model the incoming limit buy orders at a more favourable price , and negative jumps to account for cancellations of limit buy orders and market sell orders which walk the lob .",
    "explicit examples will be provided in section [ eq : numerics ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ask ] ) models the spread process , of which width is affected by both , the market activity on the ask side and on the bid side of the book .",
    "in particular , when the best bid price increases , the spread process should decrease by the same amount , assuming that the ask price remains unchanged .",
    "we therefore include the jump processes of the bid price in the dynamics of the spread process through the functions @xmath32 .",
    "the activity on the ask side is accounted for by the functions @xmath30 .",

    "we introduce the possibility for the investor to trade in a standard exchange and in a dark pool at the same time .",
    "the investor faces a trade - off between a costly and sure trade execution in the exchange and the alternative of a more remunerative but uncertain execution in the dark pool .",
    "we take this opportunity to emphasise the differences between the recent literature  e.g .",
    "kratz and schneborn @xcite , and horst and naujokat @xcite  and the present work .",
    "firstly , we model both the best bid price and the spread process , thus allowing for a more realistic description of market features , for there is no such thing as a mid - price in the market .",
    "furthermore , by modelling both the bid price and the spread process , we also include the effect of the sell side of the lob on the optimal strategy , which is justified since the two sides of the lob are known to be highly correlated .",
    "we also include a permanent impact by the trades on the market prices .",
    "we do not require for the price processes to be martingales , as it is well known that they mean - revert to their long - term value .",
    "we further consider the possibility of partial execution in the dark pool , and we do not restrict the problem to full liquidation by @xmath43 . finally we propose a class of models that can be adapted to ( i ) market - specific features , e.g. mean - reversion , seasonality , and intra - day patterns of the price processes , as well as to ( ii ) agent - specific preferences of calculating the p&l and/or measuring utility and risk - aversion . such generalisations come at a cost and , in particular , we are not in the position to provide analytical trading strategies .",
    "as specified earlier in this paper , we assume that the trades in the dark pool take place at the mid - price @xmath80 given by @xmath81 the purpose of this section is to find the optimal trading strategy for each venue at any time @xmath82 .",
    "we denote the optimal order size in the dark pool by @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the control process will be given by a vector - valued process @xmath84 defined by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is progressively measurable , @xmath83 is predictable and @xmath87\\times[0,n]\\subset[0,\\infty)^{2}$ ] is a compact set .",
    "we modify the inventory and the wealth dynamics since they now also depend on the dark pool activity . along the lines of horst and naujokat",
    "@xcite we model the dark - pool execution part by a jump process , but we choose a compound poisson process to account for partial execution of the submitted order .",
    "we thus write @xmath88 for the combined inventory and @xmath89 for the wealth arising from simultaneously trading in the lit and the dark pools . in the above",
    ", @xmath90 is a compound poisson process with intensity @xmath91 and i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath92 supported on @xmath93 $ ] , which model the executed portion of the submitted order . to simplify the notation",

    "the function @xmath99 may play the role of a running gain or penalty criterion .",
    "we include the lit - pool trading rate @xmath25 in @xmath99 as it may reflect a penalisation for the information leakage to which publicly - displayed orders are subject to .",
    "the function @xmath100 is the terminal reward function which includes the terminal cash and a penalty for the remainder of the inventory at time @xmath101 .",
    "the hjb pide for trading simultaneously in the lit and the dark pool is analogous to the one presented in section [ eq : optim ] .",
    "we skip the details at this stage , but write the exact formulation in the appendix for completion and ease of comparison with the one for trading optimally only in the standard exchange .",
    "we further note that one can recover the setting presented in section [ eq : optim ] by specifying @xmath102 .",
    "we emphasise here that kratz and schneborn @xcite model the dark pool as a complete - or - zero - execution venue , where the placed order is either fully executed , when a suitable counterparty is found , or it expires unexecuted .",
    "their optimal strategy in the single - asset case  which consists of placing small portions of the inventory in the exchange and all the remainder in the dark pool  can be obtained as a special case of the present model ( see figure [ eq : krsh ] ) .",
    "in this section we investigate in detail two particular examples of the best bid price and the spread processes defined by equations ( [ eq : bid ] ) and ( [ eq : ask ] ) . in the numerical solutions that follow ,",
    "the chosen parameters are for illustrative purposes .",
    "an analysis of real data is beyond the scope of the present work .      as well - known by practitioners and as also taken into account in much of the current literature ( see e.g. cartea et al .",
    "@xcite , and fodra and pham @xcite ) , the lob mid - price mean - reverts quickly to its long - term mean .",

    "<S> we consider an optimal trading problem over a finite period of time during which an investor has access to both a standard exchange and a dark pool . </S>",
    "<S> we take the exchange to be an order - driven market and propose a continuous - time setup for the best bid price and the market spread , both modelled by lvy processes . </S>",
    "<S> effects on the best bid price arising from the arrival of limit buy orders at more favourable prices , the incoming market sell orders potentially walking the book , and deriving from the cancellations of limit sell orders at the best ask price are incorporated in the proposed price dynamics . a permanent impact that occurs when </S>",
    "<S> ` lit ' pool trades can not be avoided is built in , and an instantaneous impact that models the slippage , to which all lit exchange trades are subject , is also considered . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the trading price in the dark pool is the mid - price and that no fees are due for posting orders . </S>",
    "<S> we allow for partial trade executions in the dark pool , and we find the optimal trading strategy in both venues . since the mid - price is taken from the exchange , the dynamics of the limit order book also affects the optimal allocation of shares in the dark pool . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a general objective function and we show that , subject to suitable technical conditions , the value function can be characterised by the unique continuous viscosity solution to the associated partial integro differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> we present two explicit examples of the price and the spread models , and derive the associated optimal trading strategy numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the various degrees of the agent s risk aversion and further show that roundtrips  </S>",
