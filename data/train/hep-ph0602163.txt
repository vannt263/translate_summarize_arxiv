    "measurements of  mass modifications  of hadrons at finite temperature or when situated inside nuclear matter , that means embedded in a bulk of protons and neutrons , could then probe the qcd vacuum .",
    "the properties of this ground state are quantified in a number of condensates , which , like universal material constants , carry important information on symmetry features of the theory .",
    "besides @xmath3 up to mass dimension 6 the gluon condensate @xmath5 , the mixed quark - gluon condensate @xmath6 , the triple gluon condensate @xmath7 and structures of the form @xmath8 contribute .",

    "we discuss how some of these condensates could change under the influence of surrounding nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , the method of qcd sum rules is applied , which is able to deal with a large variety of hadrons , so our findings and similar considerations for other hadrons can reveal more insight into changes of hadronic properties at finite baryon density .",

    "[ fig : condensatesdensitytemperature ] shows that with increasing temperature or density the chiral and gluon condensates decrease .",

    "even the often quoted ioffe formula for the nucleon mass @xmath18 points to similar conclusions .",
    "however , instead of simple pocket formulas , one has to perform consistent qcd sum rule evaluations for an accurate inclusion of relevant condensates .",

    "it changes the absolute value of the critical @xmath36 , but not the qualitative requirement of a strong density dependence of the combined four - quark condensates for consistency with the observation of cb - taps .",
    "this implies at finite densities a considerable drop of the four - quark condensate combination considered here . as a consequence",
    "the integrated @xmath47 spectral density must be  down shifted  even stronger .",
    "we now apply qcd sum rules to derive predictions on the in - medium behavior of self - energies of the nucleon as they occur in its propagation function @xmath48 which can be decomposed into invariant parts using the two characteristic lorentz vectors of the problem , the nucleon momentum @xmath49 and the medium velocity @xmath50 .",
    "this decomposition together with the pole structure of @xmath51 leads to the definition of the scalar and vector self - energies @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the first accounts for the deviation from the nucleon vacuum mass @xmath54 . in - medium",
    "chiral perturbation theory for example predicts large cancellation effects between these two quantities @xcite , i.e. the self - energies should be comparable in magnitude but have opposite signs .",
    "qcd sum rule evaluations showed a significant dependence of the self - energies on the density behavior of four - quark condensates @xcite .",
    "the standard treatment for four - quark condensates is to simplify it to squares of the chiral condensate @xmath55 ( this is the ground state saturation approximation ) , which is supported by large @xmath56 arguments . as for the @xmath0 case above we repeat to test this approximation while we apply our parameterization of four - quark condensates for the full set of structures which appear in the operator product expansion for the nucleon interpolating fields .",
    "the sum of all parameterized four - quark condensates up to a linear dependence in baryon density @xmath15 @xmath57 yields effective parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 which describe deviations from the standard treatment .",
    "the sum runs over all four - quark condensates with weight factors @xmath60 and extends the condensate list for the vacuum case @xcite , @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote dirac , color and flavor structures ; @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants and estimate the order of magnitude as given by the factorization limit .",
    "a value of @xmath65 corresponds to no density - dependence of the combined four - quark condensates , a value of @xmath66 to a density behavior similar to that of the squared chiral condensate ( @xmath58 is adapted to the correct vacuum nucleon mass ) .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleondensity ] exhibit the variation of the dominant @xmath67 and its consequences for the self - energies as function of the fermi momentum of the nucleon .",
    "the sum rules for the nucleon involve actually three equations each of them containing its own set of four - quark condensates , we consider here the most sensitive part with @xmath67 .",
    "a symmetric picture of self - energies is achieved if the combined four - quark condensates are hardly density dependent , expressed by @xmath68 .",
    "calculations of four - quark condensates in a perturbative chiral quark model support this choice @xcite .",
    "( upper part ) and @xmath53 ( lower part ) of the nucleon as functions of the nucleon fermi momentum @xmath69 for different density dependencies of the combined four - quark condensates .",
    "the preferred symmetric picture is realized if this dependence is weak.,width=245 ]    the four - quark condensates in sum rules for baryons like the nucleon differ significantly from those in meson sum rules .",
    "the three quark systems generically yield the occurrence of linear combinations of these condensates already in zeroth order of @xmath70 in two different color structures .",
    "this interestingly leads to a reduction of the list of independent four - quark structures for baryons , contrary it makes a connection to meson four - quark condensates partially impossible , since the latter appear only with one type of color contraction .",
    "therefore , a consideration of structures in other baryon sum rules , for example the @xmath71 , could provide more information on four - quark condensates and especially how the sum rules of nucleon and other baryons are related in this respective .      in confined systems including a heavy quark @xmath72 ( say charm ) the inverse mass deals as expansion parameter , further other condensates can become important .",
    "for example , wilson coefficients which contain the heavy quark mass like a term @xmath73 are numerically amplified ( contrary to the @xmath0 sum rule ) . in the case of charmed mesons",
    "one can relate combinations of positive and negative frequency parts of the correlation function to even and odd components with respect to @xmath74 of the operator product expansion @xmath75 so that sum rules for @xmath76 and @xmath77 yield predictions on the average mass and the mass splitting ; @xmath74 is the time component of the off - shell @xmath1 meson at rest .",
    "it has been suggested that the center of masses @xmath78 decreases slightly in medium  @xcite , accompanied by an enhancement of the splitting @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "quantitative uncertainties arise due to the questionable use of a pole + continuum ansatz as well as not well known but important condensates , especially mixed quark - gluon structures .",
    "this point deserves further detailed studies with respect to envisaged investigations within the cbm and panda projects at fair .    for systems of two heavy quarks",
    "@xmath80 , like @xmath20 , one might naively expect a further enhancement of the role of the chiral condensate .",
    "however , only the combination @xmath81 enters the sum rule ; in leading order there is no term @xmath82 . in the heavy quark mass expansion",
    "the heavy chiral condensate is related to gluonic condensates @xcite @xmath83 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heavyquarkmassexpansionchiralcondensate ] ) is by means of the equations of motion related to four - quark condensates .",
    "a sum rule evaluation for @xmath20 @xcite shows tiny in - medium effects , conceivable from the lowest dimension gluonic condensate @xmath5 which is inert against density changes far from the deconfinement boundary .",
    "it was pointed out that qcd sum rules relate hadronic properties at finite temperature and/or density to universal condensates parameterizing the qcd ground state . among these for @xmath0 meson and nucleon we emphasized the importance of the density dependence of combined four - quark condensates , which appears to be strong for the @xmath0 case and weak for the combinations in the nucleon example . in systems containing heavy quarks other condensates contribute dominantly .",
    "although four - quark condensates can not generally be considered as order parameters for chiral symmetry , only specific combinations behave like the chiral condensate @xmath55 under chiral transformations , they nevertheless carry information about the complicated structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "this , in summary , signals significant modifications of the ground state , and since the condensates represent universal parameters for all hadrons an understanding of the @xmath0 and nucleon in - medium properties is inevitable incorporated with the density - dependent properties of all low - lying hadrons .",
