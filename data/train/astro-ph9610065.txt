    "one of the most significant and stubborn mysteries in astrophysics today concerns the nature of the dark matter in spiral galaxies ( e.g.  rubin et al .  1978 ) .",
    "the least radical candidate for such dark matter is baryonic objects which are too large to be detected as dust or gas . indeed ,",
    "if the hubble constant is not too large , a significant fraction of the baryons , as implied by big bang nucleosynthesis , must be hidden as dark matter ( walker et al .",
    "arguments have been made for why such dark baryonic objects are unlikely on individual mass scales of atoms to brown dwarfs ( hills 1986 , hegyi & olive 1986 ) .",
    "still , objects of primordial composition and more massive than about @xmath3 might be expected to resist evaporation until the present day ( de rjula et al .",
    "1992 ) , while masses smaller than about @xmath4 would fail to ignite as stars ( burrows et al .",
    "1993 ) .    astrophysicists frustration explaining the dark matter with any directly detectable objects has led to the suggestion that gravitational microlensing might be used to at least betray the presence of individual objects via their effects on background stars as sources ( paczynski 1986 ) , and",
    "thereby give some indication as to their mass .",
    "such searches have recently taken place towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 , aubourg et al .",
    "1995 ) and bulge ( alcock et al .  1995 , paczynski et al .",
    "1994 ) , with searches towards the lmc ruling out most of the dark matter being composed of substellar - mass objects ( aubourg et al .",
    "1995 , alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) heavier than about @xmath5 , while suggesting that a large fraction might have the same component mass as low - mass stars ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) . given the uncertainty of the galactic halo s distribution of massive , compact , halo objects ( machos ) and therefore the lensing geometry leading to events , the relationship between mass and observed microlensing lightcurve timescale is still unclear .    in part because of its unique geometry with respect to earth and partially due to high predicted optical depths ( @xmath6 ) due to lensing , m31 is a uniquely powerful venue for studying microlensing .",
    "early we realized that an m31 microlensing survey would show particular advantages if the practical aspects of studying such a distant , crowded field of stars could be overcome .",
    "we found such an approach , briefly outlined by crotts ( 1992 ) with a complete description of the realistic technique and preliminary results found in tomaney and crotts ( 1996 , hereafter tc ) . by subtracting images in a time sequence , then performing `` difference image photometry '' ( dip ,",
    "also know as `` pixel lensing '' ) , we can study the residual point sources due to variables , while the signals from the many crowded , non - varying stars subtract away . with a practical method of observation and analysis",
    ", we can exploit the advantages inherent in studying m31 : 1 ) very small component mass limits , due to the small angle subtended by the photosphere of m31 stars compared to the einstein radius of objects of solar mass ( c.f .",
    "tc for low - mass results ) , 2 ) the ability to study different parts of m31 , thereby studying the spatial distribution of microlensing objects , 3 ) the ability to study many stars at once in fields of high @xmath6 , thereby detecting events in short periods of observation , and 4 ) the constrained microlensing geometry , due to the fact that lensing mass is concentrated over the center of the galaxy , thereby allowing a better determination of the macho mass given microlensing event timescale .",
    "it is our hope that by studying m31 in this way , both its halo and bulge , one can more readily understand both these results and those obtained in the galaxy .",
    "this paper presents our results from our first season of observation toward this goal .",
    "observations were made primarily at the vatican advanced technology telescope on 31 december 1994 , 31 january , 17 october through 4 november and 20 november through december 3 , 1995 , using an imager especially made for accommodating dip .",
    "additional observations were made with the prime focus kpno 4-m prime focus camera on 24 - 27 september 1994 and 28 august 1995 .",
    "the vatt data were taken using field centers of 00:43:16.5 + 41:11:33 and 00:42:13.4 + 41:20:44 ( j2000 ) , and rotation of the ccd so that its sides were roughly parallel to m31 s principle axes .",
    "the first field looks past the bulge , intercepting the far side of the disk along the minor axis .",
    "most data were obtained in the first field , such that light curves in the second are too incomplete to treat here .",
    "observations on the kpno 4 m were centered close to the first vatt location , such that the 4 m field ( 16.4 arcmin on a side ) encompasses all but 0.1% of the vatt field ( 11.3 arcmin on a side ) .",
    "the two telescopes fields are rotated 38@xmath7 with respect to each other .",
    "we do not consider here 4 m data falling outside the vatt field . assuming a distance to m31 of 770  kpc ( 4.46 arcmin / kpc ) , the vatt field covers a range of 0.4 to 2.9  kpc along the minor axis , which projects to 1.8 to 13.1  kpc along the disk , assuming an inclination @xmath8 .",
    "we use the filter bands described in tc , essentially broad r and i bands to match the fact that most of our target stars in m31 are red giants or supergiants and therefore brighter in redder bands .",
    "the process of difference image photometry consists of careful flat - fielding , coordinate registration and photometric scaling of the data , followed by point spread function ( psf ) matching between frames ( detailed in tc ) . using a convolution kernel approximating the quotient between psfs in the image from a particular epoch and that from a high-@xmath9 , good - seeing stack of many images , the psfs are matched either by degrading the image stack or single epoch s image to match the other . in the case of the vatt data ,",
    "the entire frame can be corrected in this way due to the optical design of our imager , which insures that a single convolution kernel is need over the entire ( or nearly all ) of the image ( see tc for more details ) .",
    "this is especially easy because in these data we deal only with nightly sums , composed of @xmath10 similar exposures , so that individual irregularities of single exposures , such as guiding errors , average out .",
    "after psf matching is accomplished , the stack ( taken from many night s data ) and the individual night s image are subtracted , leaving a field of noise at nearly the photon shot noise level , as well as isolated positive or negative point source residuals due to variable stars .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure 1 , for the fourth candidate microlensing event detailed in figure 2 .",
    "dip is completed by performing aperture photometry on these isolated residual sources , which can then be incorporated into light curves .",
    "the error bars presented with the lightcurves in figures 2 and 3 show the fluctuations in the difference image on the scale of the psf in regions adjacent to each residual source .",
    "sources were catalogued by requiring at least a 4@xmath11 detection in at least two nightly sums ( or 6@xmath11 in the 24% of the image containing the bulge and closest to the minor axis ) , then tracing the lightcurve by aperture photometry in other epochs at the same location . in future papers we will track additional sources by 1 ) sampling variations on sub - night scales , and 2 ) summing difference images so that weaker residuals can be tracked over longer timescales . even without these refinements , however , we locate over 2000 sources within the vatt field .",
    "the results of this construction of lightcurves from nightly sums is that no source is only on two consecutive nights , and that none of the sources seen , with one exception , is consistent with microlensing events on any but nearly the longest timescales sampled by our survey . in the latter cases ,",
    "we portray the lightcurves of the six candidate events in figures 2 , and other information in table 1 , including their positions ( j2000 ) and distance along m31 s minor axis ( @xmath12 ) . assuming that they are microlensing events",
    ", several other parameters can also be extracted : the duration ( einstein radius crossing time @xmath13 ) , lensing impact parameter ( normalized to the einstein radius : @xmath14 ) , and source baseline magnitude ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "not given are the two other fit parameters , time of peak amplification and flux zero - point offset due to image subtraction .",
    "additionally we give the goodness of the best lensing fit ( for point sources and masses ) , and the most probable mass of the lens .",
    "it appears that fit residuals are slightly larger than expected from photometric measurement error alone , seen particularly as a surplus in the number of 3@xmath11 or greater residuals , which are inconsistent with neighboring points .",
    "one possibility for this noise is underlying rr lyrae variables , which should be evident at the 1 - 2@xmath11 level , either coincident with the source or in its photometric background annulus .",
    "we will investigate this problem further in tomaney et al .",
    "we stress that _ we do not claim that these are microlensing events at least until their lightcurves are observed to fall and remain at the pre - event baseline _ during the 1996 observing season or thereafter .",
    "one reason for our caution is the lightcurve shown in figure 3 for the variable star found at 0@xmath1643@xmath1737.@xmath189 @xmath1941@xmath714@xmath2057@xmath21 ( j2000 ) , 1.92  kpc from the major axis .",
    "it is fit well by a microlensing lightcurve during its rise and fall , but does not maintain a consistent baseline before and after the event . upon inspection of lightcurves of mira - type variables",
    "( wesselink 1987 ) , we find a small fraction whose lightcurves around maximum light mimic the behaviour of microlensing lightcurves . a sparse sampling of points beyond maximum light ,",
    "if chosen unfortuitously , might fail to distinguish such a variable from a microlensing event .",
    "we find several such variables in our vatt field .",
    "further reasons for suspicion is the similarity in timescales to those of miras ( except the first event ) , and similar shapes , indicated by @xmath22 values which cluster around 0.6 ( except for the second event ) .",
    "additionally , it is strange that all sources have @xmath23 , close to the magnitude that would correspond to a mira pulsation ( given the inferred @xmath22 ) , but brighter than what we might expect for lensed sources given the luminosity function of stars in the field .",
    "we suspect that several of these events are not due to microlensing at all , but might be associated with bright variable stars .",
    "another season of observation , which we plan , will determine if these sources maintain a constant baseline and are therefore likely to be lensed .",
    "the reality of these events can be tested in terms of the distribution of @xmath22 values via a one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "the theoretical distribution is derived using a luminosity function in @xmath15 @xmath24 , where @xmath25 best describes the behavior of star counts and surface brightness fluctuations in the field , and agrees with other works ( tomaney & crotts 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "very low @xmath22 values ( @xmath26 ) are not realistic since high amplification events have timescales too short for us to detect ; high @xmath22 events ( @xmath27 ) have amplifications too subtle for us to detect , as well .",
    "we take as the @xmath22 upper bound the lesser of the above upper bound and the maximum value providing sufficient amplification to reach our flux threshold for a given magnitude . for values of @xmath22 between these limits , we assume a uniform distribution of events in @xmath22 , at a given magnitude .",
    "the largest value of the k - s distance @xmath28 occurs at the smallest observed @xmath29 , due to the lack of small @xmath22 events , and has a value @xmath30 .",
    "assuming that all six candidates are true microlensing events , the null hypothesis ( consistency with microlensing ) is rejected at the 99.5% level .",
    "if half the candidates are microlensing events ( and the minimum still @xmath31 ) , the null hypothesis is rejected at approximately the 90% level .",
    "it is unlikely that all of the events are due to microlensing , but this test can not rule out that a large fraction may be .    these caveats aside , _ if _",
    "these events are microlensing events , then we can say several things about them .",
    "the first and second events land in the bulge - dominated region , and hence likely involve bulge sources .",
    "the third and fourth might be due to disk sources ( but have a high probability of belonging to the bulge ) and also rest in the region where bulge lenses may dominate over halo lenses .",
    "the fifth and sixth events , if genuine , might easily be halo lenses acting on disk sources . in the case of third through sixth events , the most probable source - lens distance is @xmath32 , allowing us to compute a most likely mass , given @xmath13 .",
    "( we assume a disk rotation speed of 260  km  s@xmath33 [ braun 1991 ] and a halo / bulge velocity dispersion of 160  km  s@xmath33 [ kent 1989 ] , of which @xmath34 is in the transverse direction .",
    "earth s transverse motion is negligible . )",
    "we assume no rotation of the bulge ; it could be as large as @xmath35100  km  s@xmath33 in our field ( kent 1989 ) , meaning that inferred masses might tend to split into a bimodal distribution of under- and overestimated values , with peaks differing by as much as a factor of two in timescale , or four in mass .",
    "several approaches have been taken to estimating the predicted @xmath6 in m31 due to its own mass distribution . initially crotts ( 1992 )",
    "just approximated the entire mass of m31 as an @xmath36 density distribution , which produces an optical depth for far - side disk stars of @xmath37 .",
    "the presence of a core saturation radius will reduce @xmath6 in the center of m31 while maintaining this high plateau value at larger radii .",
    "jetzer ( 1994 ) considers the effects of only the dark matter halo , with a large core radius of 5  kpc , and finds a value of @xmath38 in the center of m31 , rising to @xmath39 at the outer edge of our field .",
    "han and gould ( 1996 ) treat both the halo and bulge of m31 and find @xmath40 in the center , dominated by the bulge , falling to @xmath39 at the outside edge of our field , where the halo dominates .",
    "there is a factor of about 1.3 disagreement between the lower values of jetzer versus crotts and han & gould due to different assumed values of m31 s rotation velocity .",
    "lensing of disk stars by other disk stars produces a @xmath6 component of @xmath41 ( gould 1994 ) , while a standard galactic halo model adds @xmath42 ( paczynski 1986 ) .",
    "together , these components sum to at least @xmath43 throughout the field , which is the value that we will adopt for the sake of discussion .",
    "note that this is about an order of magnitude greater than that suggested by galactic survey results towards the lmc ( @xmath44 , alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) , or for predicted galactic / lmc halo values ( @xmath45 , alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) , but only slightly larger than galactic bulge results ( @xmath46 , paczynski et al .  1994 ; @xmath47 , alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) .    from our previous constraints on the luminosity function of stars in our field ( tc ) , we have estimate that we are sensitive to detectable microlensing of any of @xmath48 stars in our field .",
    "these data are primarily sensitive to timescales ranging from 2@xmath49 to 10@xmath49 , corresponding to 0.003  @xmath1 to 0.08  @xmath1 .",
    "we have 13 and 2 sample times respectively corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath51 star - epochs .",
    "the predicted number of events for this mass range given a @xmath52 of @xmath53 is 45 to 7 events . except for one possible detection at the upper end of this range",
    ", we find no events on these timescales , thereby eliminating this mass range as a 100% contribution to the mass of m31 at considerably better than 95% confidence .",
    "on the other hand , we expect to detect approximately 2 events ( given 100% efficiency ) if the mass of m31 is made entirely of @xmath2 objects , while we see six candidates , half of which are at this scale or larger .",
    "this argues that some of these may not be caused by microlensing .",
    "our primary result is ( 1 ) the lack of any detection corresponding to masses up to @xmath54 ( with perhaps one exception ) , and ( 2 ) the possible detection of events on the scale of about @xmath2 .",
    "the number of such events on this larger timescale , however , is significantly greater than would be predicted given models of the lensing optical depth , so might indicate contamination by variable stars .",
    "both of these results are consistent with microlensing searches in both the bulge and halo of our galaxy ( e.g. paczynski et al .",
    "1994 , alcock et al .  1995 , 1996 )",
    "in which few , if any , substellar masses are detected .",
    "likewise , slightly sub - solar masses are indicated as the primary cause of microlensing events both towards the lmc and bulge .",
    "a further season of data will determine whether our six candidates are simply variable stars , or exhibit constant baseline , implicating them as microlensing events .",
    "we appreciate the assistance of robert uglesich in the preparation of this paper .",
    "we also thank the vatican observatory research group , in particular richard boyle and chris corbally , in assisting our efforts on the vatt , and the steward observatory engineering group , in particular richard cromwell and steve west .",
