    "to accommodate the ever increasing traffic in wireless spectrum , fcc has legalized the unlicensed access of a part of the licensed spectrum band- which is known as _",
    "secondary access_. however , secondary access will only proliferate when it is rendered profitable to license holders ( primaries ) .",
    "we devise a framework to enable primaries to decide price they would charge unlicensed users ( secondaries ) .",
    "the price will depend on the transmission rate which evolves randomly owing to usage of subscribers of primaries and fading .",
    "a secondary receives a payoff from a channel depending on the transmission rate offered by the channel and the price quoted by the primary .",
    "secondaries buy those channels which give them the highest payoff , which leads to a _ competition _ among primaries .",
    "price selection in oligopolies has been extensively investigated in economics as a non co - operative bertrand game @xcite and its modifications @xcite .",
    "price competition among wireless service providers have also been explored to a great extent @xcite .",
    "we divide this genre of works in two parts : i ) papers which model price competition as auction ( @xcite ) , and ii ) papers which model the price competition as a non co - operative game ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now distinguish our work with respect to these papers .",
    "as compared to the genre of work in the first category our model is readily scalable and a central auctioneer is not required . some papers in the second category @xcite considered the quality of primaries as a factor while selecting the price .",
    "but all of these papers mentioned above , ignore two important properties which distinguish spectrum oligopoly from standard oligopolies : first , a primary selects a price knowing only the transmission rate of its own channel ; it is unaware of transmission rates offered by channels of its competitors .",
    "thus , if a primary quotes a high price , it will earn a large profit if it sells its channel , but may not be able to sell at all ; on the other hand a low price will enhance the probability of a sale but may also fetch lower profits in the event of a sale .",
    "second , the same spectrum band can be utilized simultaneously at geographically dispersed locations without interference ; but the same band can not be utilized simultaneously at interfering locations ; this special feature , known as _ spatial reuse _ adds another dimension in the strategic interaction as now a primary has to cull a set of non - interfering locations which is denoted as an _ independent set _ ; at which to offer its channel apart from selecting a price at every node of that set .",
    "we have accommodated both of the above the uncertainty of competition in this paper .",
    "building on the results we obtain in this paper , we have accommodated both of the above characteristics in the sequel .",
    "some recent works ( @xcite ) that consider uncertainty of competition and the impact of spatial reuse ( @xcite and @xcite ) assume that the commodity on sale can be in one of two states : available or otherwise .",
    "this assumption does not capture different transmission rates offered by available channels .",
    "a primary may now need to employ different pricing strategies and different independent set selection strategies for different transmission rates , while in the former case a single pricing and independent set selection strategy will suffice as a price needs not be quoted for an unavailable commodity .",
    "our investigation seeks to contribute in this space .",
    "we have studied the price competition in spectrum oligopoly in a sequel of two papers .",
    "overall a primary has to select an independent set and a pricing strategy in each location of the independent set . in this paper",
    "we focus only on the pricing strategy of primaries by studying the game for only one location .",
    "the results that we have characterized provide indispensable tools for studying the joint decision problem involving multiple locations . in the sequel to this paper",
    ", we provide a framework for solving the joint decision problem building on the single location pricing strategy .",
    "in addition , initially secondary market is likely to be introduced in geographically dispersed locations ; which are unlikely to interfere with each other , thus , the price competition in each location reduces to a single location pricing problem which we solve in this paper .",
    "the reduced problem turns out to be of independent interest as it exhibits certain desirable properties which no longer hold when there are multiple locations .",
    "we formulate the price selection as a game in which each primary selects a price depending on the transmission rate its channel provides .",
    "since prices can take real values , the strategy space is uncountably infinite ; which precludes the guarantee of the existence of an nash equilibrium ( ne ) strategy profile .",
    "also standard algorithms for computing an ne strategy profile do not exist unlike when the strategy space is finite .",
    "first , we consider that primaries interact only once ( section  [ sec : onenodegame ] ) .",
    "we consider that the preference of the secondaries can be captured by a penalty function which associates a penalty value to each channel that is available for sale depending on its transmission rate and the price quoted .",
    "we show that for a large class of penalty functions , there exists a _",
    "unique _ ne strategy profile , which we explicitly compute ( section  [ sec : computation ] ) . in the sequel to this paper , we show that this is no longer the case when a primary owns a channel over multiple locations .",
    "we show that the unique ne strategy profile is symmetric i.e. price selection strategy of all primaries are statistically identical .",
    "our analysis reveals that primaries select price in a manner such that the preference order of transmission rates is retained .",
    "this negates the intuition that prices ought to be selected so as to render all transmission rates equally preferable to a secondary .",
    "the analysis also reveals that the unique ne strategy profile consists of `` nice '' cumulative distributions in that they are continuous and strictly increasing ; the former rules out pure strategy nes and the latter ensures that the support sets are contiguous .",
    "subsequently , utilizing the explicit computation algorithm for the symmetric ne strategies , we analytically investigate the reduction in expected profit suffered under the unique symmetric ne pricing strategies as compared to the maximum possible value allowing for collusion among primaries ( section  [ sec : slnumerical]).finally , we extend our one shot game at single location , to a repeated game where primaries interact with each other multiple number of times ( section  [ sec : repeatedgame ] ) and compute a subgame perfect nash equilibrium ( spne ) in which a primary attains a payoff which is arbitrarily close to the payoff that a primary would have obtained if primaries were select price jointly ; thus , price competition does not lower payoff . _",
    "all proofs are relegated to appendix_.",
    "we consider a spectrum market with @xmath0 primaries .",
    "each primary owns a channel .",
    "different channels leased by primaries to secondaries constitute disjoint frequency bands .",
    "there are @xmath1 secondaries .",
    "we initially consider the case when primaries know @xmath1 , later generalize our results for random , apriori unknown @xmath1 ( section  [ sec : random ] ) .",
    "the channel of a primary provides a certain transmission rate to a secondary who is granted access . transmission rate ( i.e. shanon capacity ) depends on 1 ) the number of subscribers of a primary that are using the channel at a channel is equal to @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the power with which user @xmath4 is transmitting , @xmath5 is the power of white noise , @xmath6 is the channel gain between transmitter and receiver which depends on the propagation condition .",
    "if a secondary is using the channel then @xmath7 of the numerator are the attributes associated with the secondary while @xmath8 are those of the subscribers of the primaries . in general , the power @xmath9 for subscriber of primaries is constant for subscriber @xmath10 of primary , but the number of subscribers vary randomly over time .",
    "the power @xmath11 with which a secondary will transmit may be a constant or may decrease with the number of subscribers of primaries in order to limit the interference caused to each subscriber .",
    "the above factors contributes to the random fluctuation in the capacity of a channel offered to a secondary . in our setting @xmath7s",
    "are assumed to be the same across the secondaries for a channel which we justify later",
    ". however , these values can be different for different channels . ] and 2 ) the propagation condition of the radio signal .",
    "the transmission rate evolves randomly over time owing to the random fluctuations of the usage of subscribers of primaries and the propagation condition and @xmath5 evolve randomly owing to the random scattering of the particles in the ionosphere and troposphere ; this phenomenon is also known as _ fading_. ] .",
    "we assume that at every time slot , the channel of a primary belongs to one of the states @xmath12 .",
    "this is a standard approximation to discretize the continuous function@xcite .",
    "the corresponding inaccuracy becomes negligible with increase in @xmath13 . ] .",
    "state @xmath14 provides a lower transmission rate to a secondary than state @xmath10 if @xmath15 and state @xmath16 arises when the channel is not available for sale i.e. secondaries can not use the channel when it is in state @xmath16 indicates that the transmission rate is below that threshold due to either the excessive usage of subscribers of primaries or the transmission condition . ] .",
    "a channel is in state @xmath17 w.p .",
    "@xmath18 and in state @xmath16 w.p .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 , independent of the channel states of other primaries .",
    "thus , the state of the channel of each primary is independent and identically distributed .",
    "we do not make any assumption on the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath22 or @xmath21 and @xmath1 . ) at a channel does not depend on @xmath1 ( secondary demand ) in practice . ] .",
    "we assume @xmath23    we assume that the transmission rate offered by the channel of a primary is the same to all secondaries .",
    "we justify the above assumption in the following .",
    "we consider the setting where the secondaries are one of the following types : i ) service provider who does not lease spectrum from the fcc and serves the end - users through secondary access , ii ) end - users who directly buy a channel from primaries . in initial stages of deployment of the secondary market",
    ", secondaries will be of the first type .",
    "when the secondaries are of the first type , then a primary would not know the transmission rate to the end - users who are subscribers of the service provider . a primary measures the channel qualities across different positions in the locality ( e.g. a cell ) and considers the average as the channel quality that an end - user subscribed to a secondary service provider will get at the location ( e.g. a cell )",
    ". this average will be identical across different end - users subscribed to different secondary service providers and hence , the channel quality is identical across the secondaries . if the secondaries are of the second type , then the primary may know the transmission rate that an end - user will attain which may be different at different positions .",
    "however , if a primary needs to select a price for each position of the location , then it needs to compute the transmission rate at each possible position at that location ( e.g. a cell ) .",
    "thus , the computation and storage requirement for the primary would be large .",
    "such position based pricing scheme will also not be attractive to the end - users since they may perceive it discriminatory as the price changes when its position changes within a location ( e.g. a cell ) .",
    "thus , such a position based pricing scheme may not be practically implementable .",
    "hence , a primary estimates the channel quality and decides the price for the estimated channel quality by considering that the channel quality will not significantly vary across the location .",
    "this is because end - users who are interested to buy the channel from a primary at a location most likely have similar propagation paths : for example , secondary users who buy the channels are most often present in buildings ( e.g. shopping complex , an office or residential area ) .",
    "the distance from the base station of the primary to the end - users is also similar because the end - users are close to each other in a location .",
    "thus , the path loss component will also similar .",
    "hence , the channel quality is considered to be identical across the secondaries .",
    "though the quality of a channel is identical for secondaries , the quality can vary across the channels .",
    "a primary can get an estimate of the transmission rate by sending a pilot test signal at different positions with the location and then , applying some standard estimation techniques@xcite .",
    "each primary selects a price for its channel if it is available for sale .",
    "we formulate the decision problem of primaries as a non - cooperative game .",
    "a primary selects a price with the knowledge of the state of its channel , but without knowing the states of the other channels ; a primary however knows @xmath24 .",
    "secondaries are passive entities .",
    "they select channels depending on the price and the transmission rate a channel offers .",
    "we assume that the preference of secondaries can be represented by a penalty function .",
    "if a primary selects a price @xmath25 at channel state @xmath14 , then the channel incurs a penalty @xmath26 for all secondaries .",
    "as the name suggests , a secondary prefers a channel with a lower penalty . since lower prices should induce lower penalty , thus",
    ", we assume that each @xmath27 is strictly increasing ; therefore , @xmath27 is invertible .",
    "a primary selects a price for its available channel , but , since there is an one - to - one relation between the price and penalty at each state , we can equivalently consider that primaries select penalties instead . for a given price",
    ", a channel of higher transmission rate must induce lower penalty , thus , @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "we can also consider that desirability of a channel for a secondary is the negative of penalty .",
    "a secondary will not buy any channel whose desirability falls below a certain threshold , equivalently , whose penalty exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "we consider that such threshold is the same for each secondary and we denote it as @xmath30 i.e. no secondary will buy any channel whose penalty exceeds @xmath30 .",
    "secondaries have the same penalty function and the same upper bound for penalty value ( @xmath30 ) , thus , secondaries are statistically identical .",

    "the ties among channels with identical penalties are broken randomly and symmetrically among the primaries .",
    "[ defn : expectedpayoff ] @xmath50 is the expected payoff when primary @xmath14s channel is at state @xmath10 and selects strategy @xmath31 and other primaries use strategy @xmath39 .",

    "this is because , when @xmath57 , then , the channel of a primary will always be sold .",
    "henceforth , we will consider that @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath27 is strictly increasing in @xmath25 and @xmath60 for @xmath44 , we focus on penalty functions of the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are strictly increasing in their respective arguments .",
    "note that @xmath64 may be considered as a utility that a secondary would get at channel state @xmath14 when the price is set at @xmath25 .",
    "such utility functions are commonly assumed to be concave @xcite ; which is possible only if @xmath27 is convex in @xmath25 i.e. @xmath62 is convex .",

    "in addition , there is also a large set of functions that satisfy ( [ con1 ] ) , such as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is continuous and strictly increasing .",

    "but in some case we also consider that @xmath27 is a function of @xmath13 ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : example_nvaries ] ) .",
    "first , we identify key structural properties of a ne ( should it exist ) .",
    "next we show that the above properties lead to a unique strategy profile which we explicitly compute - thus the symmetric ne is unique should it exist .",
    "we finally prove that the strategy profile resulting from the structural properties above is indeed a ne thereby establishing the existence .",
    "we provide some important properties that any ne @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 ) must satisfy .",
    "first , we show that each primary must use the same strategy profile ( theorem  [ thm : noasymmetricne ] ) . in the sequel to this paper , we show that this is no longer the case when there are multiple locations .",
    "in fact we show that there may be multiple asymmetric nes when there are multiple locations .",
    "we show that under the ne strategy profile a primary selects lower values of the penalties when the channel quality is high ( theorem  [ thm2 ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath31 are continuous and contiguous ( theorem  [ thm1 ] and [ thm3 ] ) .",
    "[ thm : noasymmetricne ] each primary must use the same strategy i.e. @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : noasymmetricne ] implies that an ne strategy profile can not be asymmetric .",
    "since channel statistics are identical and payoff functions are identical to each primary , thus this game is symmetric . given that the game is symmetric , apparently there should only be symmetric ne strategies .",
    "although there are symmetric games where asymmetric nes do exist @xcite , we are able to rule that out in our setting using the assumptions that naturally arise in practice namely those which are stated in sections ii.a . and ii.b and assumption 1 which is satisfied by a large class of functions that are likely to arise in practice ( section ii.e ) .",
    "thus , a significance of theorem  [ thm : noasymmetricne ] is that theorem 1 holds for a large class of penalty functions which are likely to arise in practice .",
    "however , we show that there may exist asymmetric ne in absence of assumption 1 ( section  [ sec : asymmetricne ] ) .",
    "now , we point out another significance of the above theorem . in a symmetric game it is difficult to implement an asymmetric ne . for example , for two players if @xmath78 is an ne with @xmath79 , then @xmath80 is also an ne due to the symmetry of the game .",
    "the realization of such an ne is only possible when one player knows whether the other is using @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "but , coordination among players is infeasible apriori as the game is non co - operative .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thm : noasymmetricne ] entails that we can avoid such complications in this game .",
    "we show that this game has a unique symmetric ne through lemma  [ lm : computation ] and theorem  [ thm4 ] .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thm : noasymmetricne ] , lemma  [ lm : computation ] and theorem  [ thm4 ] together entail that there exists a unique ne strategy profile .",
    "since every primary uses the same strategy , thus , * we drop the indices corresponding to primaries and represent the strategy of any primary as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the strategy at channel state @xmath14 . *",
    "thus , we can represent a strategy profile in terms of only one primary .",

    "there are uncountably infinite number of penalty values and thus , clearly @xmath88 can only have jump at some of those values .",
    "intuitively , there is no inherent asymmetry amongst the penalty values within the interval @xmath89 i.e. at the penalty values except the end points of the interval @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "thus , a primary does not prioritize any of those penalty values .",
    "now , we intuitively explain why @xmath88 does not have jump at the end points .",
    "first , at penalty @xmath91 , a primary gets a payoff of @xmath16 when the channel state is @xmath14 ; but the payoff at any penalty value greater that @xmath91 is positive , thus @xmath88 does not prioritize the penalty value @xmath91 . on the other hand , intuitively if a primary selects penalty @xmath30 with positive probability , then the rest would select slightly lower penalty in order to enhance their sales and thus , the probability that the primary would sell its channel decreases .",
