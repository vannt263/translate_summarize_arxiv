    "sitter black holes are surrounded by a cosmological horizon .",
    "this limits their size and puts them in a thermal bath .",
    "their temperature is always larger than that of the cosmological horizon  @xcite . nevertheless , hawking and one of the authors argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that some black holes accrete so much quantum radiation that they will grow , or ` anti - evaporate , ' instead of evaporating ( see also  @xcite ) .    in the maximal solution ,",
    "the black hole and cosmological horizon are of equal size , and the spatial geometry will be @xmath0 , with constant two - sphere radius .",
    "this geometry can nucleate semiclassically in de  sitter space through a gravitational tunneling process .",
    "its evolution is unstable to the formation of @xmath1 de  sitter regions , distributed around the @xmath2 and connected by @xmath1 black hole throats  @xcite .",
    "this configuration may be visualized as a ` doughnut ' with @xmath1 ` wobbles , ' whose minima and maxima represent the black hole and cosmological horizons , respectively . for @xmath3 ,",
    "this reduces to the ordinary , submaximal schwarzschild - de  sitter solution . for higher @xmath1",
    ", it resembles a ring - like sequence of @xmath1 schwarzschild - de  sitter solutions . as the de  sitter regions form between the cosmological horizons ,",
    "the black holes are expected to evaporate and shrink .",
    "when they finally disappear , the doughnut is pinched in @xmath1 places , leaving @xmath1 disconnected pieces .",
    "this corresponds to the fragmentation of space into @xmath1 large daughter universes  @xcite .",
    "thus de  sitter space is globally unstable .",
    "locally , however , the daughter universes are indistinguishable from de  sitter .",
    "therefore , they will harbour more maximal black holes , whose evaporation can lead to further fragmentation .",
    "iteratively , an unbounded number of disconnected de  sitter universes is produced : de  sitter space proliferates .",
    "this drastic conclusion depends crucially on the nonlinear evolution of the instabilities of the maximal schwarzschild - de  sitter solution ( also referred to as the ` nariai ' solution below ) .      in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , the anti - evaporation and proliferation effects were derived analytically , using a number of approximations .",
    "the stability of the nariai geometry was studied using linear perturbation theory .",
    "the evolution of the horizons was found only for very early times , as a power series in the time variable .",
    "this led to the discovery of anti - evaporation for a class of perturbations .",
    "but a power series can prove only _ initial _ anti - evaporation .",
    "it can not answer an important question : will such black holes continue to grow , asymptotically approaching the maximal ( nariai ) solution ? or will their growth eventually stall , and evaporation set in after all ?",
    "this problem is highlighted by recent claims that anti - evaporation may permanently stabilize black holes nucleated during inflation  @xcite .",
    "at least for euclidean boundary conditions , it was shown that the black holes do evaporate at late times  @xcite .",
    "in fact , arguments might be made that the evaporating mode is attractive at late times for all initial conditions  @xcite . in any case , however , the intermediate period containing the putative transition between anti - evaporation and evaporation is beyond the reach of the analytical methods employed .",
    "can there be a smooth transition , and how does it proceed ? to understand this crucial phase of the black hole evolution , it should be explored numerically .",
    "if anti - evaporation is only temporary , then how can we be sure that the evaporating phase , once entered , continues until the black hole disappears ?",
    "this question is particularly important in the context of multiple black hole formation and proliferation  @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation of space is possible only if all black holes become small and disappear like schwarzschild black holes .    to show that black holes really evaporate completely , it is necessary to trace the backreaction at least until they are significantly smaller ( perhaps by a factor of 10 ) than the cosmological horizon",
    ". then they can be assumed to behave like schwarzschild black holes , which presumably radiate all of their mass away .",
    "but linear perturbation theory requires that the small two - spheres inside the black hole and the large two - spheres between the cosmological horizons still be of nearly equal size .",
    "thus , the analytic ` late - time ' solution , showing black hole evaporation , is not really valid for arbitrarily late times . a full",
    ", non - linear numerical calculation is needed to interpolate to the schwarzschild regime .      in sec .",
    "[ sec - antievap ] we consider @xmath3 perturbations of the nariai geometry , which can be parametrized by their initial amplitude , @xmath4 , and phase , @xmath5 . depending on @xmath5 ,",
    "the black holes undergo initial periods of anti - evaporation or evaporation .",
    "we demonstrate the transitory nature of anti - evaporation for neutral black holes by showing that evaporation sets in at sufficiently late times , independently of @xmath5 . the evaporation rate is compared to an approximate solution of the linear equations in order to verify that this solution is an attractor . beyond the linear regime ,",
    "the black holes are found to shrink to a size much smaller than the cosmological horizon before our computation breaks down .",
    "then they live in approximately flat space , and should simply continue to evaporate until they disappear .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - charged ] we show that maximal black holes become stable if their charge exceeds a critical value , in agreement with thermodynamic expectations .",
    "this confirms analytic arguments given in ref .",
    "in particular , we show that supercritical black holes , independently of their initial behavior , always end up anti - evaporating .",
    "this is the condition for a novel type of daughter - universe production proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - proliferation ] we show that a higher mode ( @xmath6 ) perturbation behaves as predicted by analytical arguments : first it oscillates , then it freezes out , forming black hole interiors and growing de  sitter regions .",

    "classically , the regions on the @xmath2 where the two - spheres are smaller than the nariai value should collapse to form black hole interiors . the larger two - spheres , on the other hand , should grow exponentially , developing into asymptotic de  sitter regions .",
    "if the first mode dominates , this simply leads to a nearly - maximal reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter solution .",
    "but if higher modes are strongly excited , a whole sequence of reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter solutions can develop around the same one - sphere .",
    "this may be thought of as a necklace of de  sitter regions , strung together by black hole throats .",
