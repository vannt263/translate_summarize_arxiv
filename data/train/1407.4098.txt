    "the family of materials ar@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a  @xmath4  ba , sr ; r  @xmath4  rare earth ) have been attracting interest as a new series of frustrated magnets .",
    "these systems consist of two crystallographically - inequivalent rare earth sites with very different , distorted octahedral oxygen environments .",
    "each site forms zigzag chains ( or ladders ) of magnetic r atoms running along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "bulk probes , including magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity , have shown that most members of the family have dominant antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange interactions and relatively large frustration indices@xcite .",
    "geometric frustration can arise in this structure type if the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) @xmath7 intrachain exchange interactions ( ladder legs ) are afm and the nearest neighbor ( nn ) @xmath8 intrachain couplings ( ladder rungs ) are of comparable strength .    the phase diagram for both the magnetic @xmath9  @xmath4  1/2@xcite and classical@xcite ising - like ,",
    "afm @xmath8-@xmath7 chain models have been determined theoretically . in both cases , a simple up - down - up - down ( nel ) phase and an up - up - down - down ( uudd ) phase",

    "classical spin limits , the calculations predict a field - induced up - up - down ( uud ) phase over a particular @xmath7/@xmath8 range for an applied magnetic field along the ordered spin direction .",
    "the uud spin structure leads to a 1/3 magnetization plateau . despite the extensive theoretical work on the @xmath8-@xmath7 ising chain model",
    ", there are not many examples that can be used to test its predictions , especially in the classical limit . some members of the ar@xmath0o@xmath1 family , in particular srdy@xmath0o@xmath1 and srho@xmath0o@xmath1 , have recently been proposed as model ising @xmath8-@xmath7 chain systems@xcite .",
    "there are also several other classical ising chain candidates in this family with large total angular momenta @xmath10 associated with the magnetic r atoms .",
    "several recent studies have been performed on srr@xmath0o@xmath1 , and both the nel and uudd ordering predicted by the @xmath8-@xmath7 ising chain model have been observed in these classical magnetic spin systems .",
    "however , there are several aspects of the magnetism not explained by the original theories .",
    "for example , srer@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits long - range nel order@xcite , characteristic of a small @xmath7 , coexisting with diffuse magnetic scattering@xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations reveal that the pattern from the latter is best described by dominant @xmath7 afm exchange interactions , and this finding is consistent with quasi-1d uudd ordering .",
    "one way the different scattering patterns can coexist is if the two types of zigzag chains have inequivalent @xmath8 and @xmath7 interactions and therefore host different magnetic ground states .",
    "support for this interpretation comes from rietveld refinement of the neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) data , as the best refinements arise when the long - range order is only associated with one type of er zigzag chain@xcite .",
    "a wide range of magnetic behavior is found across the srr@xmath0o@xmath1 series .",
    "srho@xmath0o@xmath1 shows very similar magnetism to the er analogue with coexisting nel and uudd ordered states , although the correlation length of these states along different crystallographic directions is still under debate@xcite . as in the er case ,",
    "the two different structures can likely be associated with the two types of ho zigzag chains .",
    "in contrast , npd shows that sryb@xmath0o@xmath1 is characterized by long - range nel order on both yb sites , although the ordered yb moment is drastically suppressed on one of the two sites@xcite .",
    "finally , srdy@xmath0o@xmath1 shows evidence for quasi-1d , uudd magnetic correlations in zero field down to 50  mk@xcite , while srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 shows no signs of magnetic ordering down to 65  mk@xcite .",
    "the low ( @xmath6  @xmath11  1  k ) or non - existent magnetic ordering temperatures , coupled with the variety of observed behavior , suggest that some combination of competing exchange interactions , single ion anisotropy , magnetic dipole interactions , and low dimensionality play important roles in shaping the magnetic phase diagrams of these materials .    in this work , we expand the earlier studies of these zigzag chain systems to band@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath10  @xmath4  9/2 ) through magnetization , heat capacity , and neutron diffraction measurements on polycrystalline samples .",
    "this material has a curie - weiss temperature of -24  k , while the measurements presented in this work indicate a magnetic transition of only @xmath3  @xmath4  1.7 k , indicative of a high magnetic frustration index f  @xmath12  12 .",
    "neutron diffraction data show evidence for a long - range antiferromagnetic ground state that arises from only one of the two nd sites , characterized by a propagation vector of @xmath5  @xmath4  ( 0 1/2 1/2 ) and the spins lying in the @xmath13-plane .",
    "furthermore , low temperature magnetization and heat capacity measurements as a function of applied field reveal an intermediate field - induced ordered state , and also indicate that any magnetic order is completely suppressed in an applied field of about 4 t as @xmath14 .",

    "about 15% extra baco@xmath15 was added to compensate for the evaporation of barium .",

    "there are two possible irreducible representations @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( kovalev s notation@xcite ) , each with six basis vectors , and therefore there are several possible candidates for the magnetic structure of band@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "however , when refinements were attempted with several different models , the component of the nd magnetic moments along @xmath31 was consistently found to be negligible ( @xmath11  0.2  @xmath24 ) .",
    "this parameter was assumed to be zero in subsequent refinements as a result .",
    "recent work on the isostructural srr@xmath0o@xmath1 family has emphasized the important role that the different crystal field environments of the two r sites play in governing the magnetic properties of these materials@xcite .",

    "only one of the two r sites was found to exhibit long - range order@xcite .",
    "for these reasons , refinements were attempted with equal moments on the two sites and also with the moment on one r site constrained to be zero .",
    "the best statistical refinements correspond to the scenario where only one nd site participates in the long - range ordering .",
    "there are eight magnetic configurations that yield nearly identical fits of the data .",
    "four of the models consist of collinear uudd intrachain spin arrangements , which are expected for classical ising @xmath8-@xmath7 chains in the large afm @xmath7 limit@xcite .",

    "the other four possible models consist of non - collinear intrachain spin textures , with nnn spins along the chains afm - coupled .",
    "these spin structures correspond to helices running along the chain direction for the special case when the nn spins are 90@xmath16 out of phase ( i.e. when four consecutive spins make up a complete period for the helix ) . while helical order is the expected ground state for an afm heisenberg @xmath8-@xmath7 model when @xmath7  @xmath32  0.25@xmath8@xcite , these non - collinear models only yield equivalent statistical refinements to the uudd models when the phases between consecutive pairs of nn spins are not constrained and refine to 63.6@xmath16 and 116.4@xmath16 .",
    "the resulting structures are unlikely from a physical standpoint and therefore are discarded .",
    "npd can not determine a unique magnetic structure for band@xmath0o@xmath1 because the refinements are insensitive to two different features of the system .",
    "firstly , the r site that corresponds to the long - range order can not be distinguished by this technique .",
    "this issue was first discussed for srer@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the situation for the present case is very similar to the er system , as only one er site was found to show long - range order .",
    "secondly , the relative phase along @xmath31 of the uudd ordered zigzag chains centered around @xmath33  @xmath4  0 and @xmath33  @xmath4  0.5 remains unknown .",

    "<S> the ar@xmath0o@xmath1 family ( r = rare earth ) have recently been attracting interest as a new series of frustrated magnets , with the magnetic r atoms forming zigzag chains running along the @xmath2-axis . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated polycrystalline band@xmath0o@xmath1 with a combination of magnetization , heat capacity , and neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic bragg peaks are observed below </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3  @xmath4  1.7  k , and they can be indexed with a propagation vector of @xmath5  @xmath4  ( 0 1/2 1/2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signal from magnetic diffraction is well described by long - range ordering from only one of the two types of nd zigzag chains , with collinear up - up - down - down intrachain spin configurations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , low temperature magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal two field - induced spin transitions at 2.5  t and 4 t for @xmath6  @xmath4  0.46  k. the high field phase is paramagnetic , while the intermediate field state may arise from a spin transition of the long - range ordered nd chains , resulting in an up - up - down intrachain spin configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed intermediate field state is consistent with the magnetic structure determined in zero field for these chains by npd , as both phases are predicted for the classical ising chain model with nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor interactions . </S>"
