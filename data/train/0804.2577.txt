    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) is one of the most rapidly developing areas of modern quantum optics and atomic molecular , and optical physics  @xcite . in its early days optical instabilities , with the paradigm example of optical bistability",
    "were in the center of interest @xcite .",
    "optical bistability emerges from the nonlinear response of the dipolar transitions of atoms to the cavity field , to which they couple .",
    "theoretically , such dynamics are well described by mean field theories formulated for macroscopic variables , such as the cavity field intensity and the total atomic polarization  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the polarization , in particular in the quantum regime , may play an important role in these processes , as pointed out for instance in the seminal studies of the late dan walls and collaborators ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typically , however , these dynamics are characterized by few _ macroscopic _ quantum degrees of freedom , where quantum fluctuations are small , except at the instability points .",
    "nonlinearity at the microscopic level has since then been reached by high - finesse resonators , where the strong coupling regime between a single atom and a single photon have been realized in several milestones experiments  @xcite . in this regime",
    "the quantum dynamics of few _ microscopic _ quantum degrees of freedom dominates the behavior of the system , and quantum fluctuations are typically large .",
    "recently experimental progress has allowed one to strongly couple cold atomic gases with the electromagnetic field mode of a resonator .",
    "this line of research , which we would like to term cavity qed of many - body systems , was stimulated by the observation on the interdependence between intracavity field and atomic motion via of the mechanical effects of light  @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by seminal experiments , which demonstrated cavity cooling of atoms  @xcite and selforganization of atoms in regular patterns inside pumped cavities  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the coherent coupling between a bose - einstein condensate and a cavity field has been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear interaction between ultracold atoms and the field of a cavity mode had been experimentally observed @xcite . in this new ultracold regime ,",
    "theoretical work on bosonic atomic gases showed that the matter - wave quantum fluctuations and the spatial mode variance give rise to additional nonlinear atom - field effects  @xcite , leading to features of the phase diagram which suggest novel bistability phenomena  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider a gas of ultracold and polarized fermionic atoms , whose dipolar transition interacts dispersively with the mode of a standing - wave resonator . in the regime",
    "in which the atomic polarization is linear in the field amplitude , and hence where there is no usual optical bistability , we encounter instabilities of the intracavity field which originate from the coupling with the atomic motion .",
    "the theoretical model we apply is based on a second - quantized approach for the description of the atomic and of the field degrees of freedom , in the regime in which the atomic internal degrees of freedom are eliminated from the equations in second order perturbation theory .",
    "these dynamics are studied by numerically integrating the heisenberg equations of motion .",
    "the results show that the instabilities of the intracavity field intensity are driven by the pump strength and by the atomic density , and indirectly depend on the degree of localization of the atoms at the minima of the cavity potential .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ii ]",
    "we theoretically derive the model , in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we solve numerically the coupled heisenberg equations of motion for field and atoms for a fixed number of atoms and thoroughly discuss the validity of the considered approximations and experimental parameters .",

    "in this section we derive the theoretical model , which is at the basis of the studies presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] . in order to introduce the many - body theory , which is the starting point of our study ,",
    "let us first review the hamiltonian of a single two - level atom of mass @xmath0 interacting with a cavity field which is pumped coherently by an external , monochromatic field .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 and @xmath2 the atomic lowering and raising operators of the dipole transition at frequency @xmath3 with ground and excited states @xmath4 , and by @xmath5 and @xmath6 the annihilation and creation operators of a cavity photon at energy @xmath7 .",
    "we further assume that the atomic motion is along the cavity axis @xmath8 , while the radial degrees of freedom are frozen out , and denote by the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 the atomic centre - of - mass momentum and position . in the dipole and rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the schrdinger equation of atomic and cavity degrees of freedom is governed by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath11 which is here given in the reference frame rotating at the pump frequency @xmath12 . the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the detunings of the pump from atomic and cavity mode frequencies , respectively , and @xmath15 is the pump amplitude .",
    "the dipole - cavity mode coupling has position - dependent strength @xmath16 with @xmath17 the cavity - mode wave number . for large detuning @xmath18",
    "the internal atomic level can be eliminated from the equations of cavity and atomic external degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and where we have considered temperatures for which the atomic motion is frozen on the time scale in which the internal degrees of freedom appreciably evolve .    for later convenience",
    "we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the recoil frequency .",
    "we remark that when neglecting the coupling between cavity and motion , hence in the classical limit , hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ jcdisp ] ) does not give rise to instabilities like in optical bistability .",
    "dispersive optical bistability , in fact , would appear when the next order in the perturbative expansion is included , giving rise to a nonlinear ( kerr ) term of the form @xmath23  @xcite . in this work we deal with",
    "the parameter ranges in which such kerr nonlinearity can be neglected , and hence classical optical bistability does not appear .",
    "moreover , we consider the regime in which the mechanical effects of photon - atom interactions are relevant . in this range ,",
    "the nonlinearity in the dynamics of hamiltonian  ( [ jcdisp ] ) is solely due to the coupling between the cavity field and the atomic quantum center - of - mass variables .",

    "the rescaled hamiltonian in second quantization reads @xmath26 where we have taken care of the proper ordering between atomic and field operators , which is here normal ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider that the number of photons is fixed to the value @xmath27 .",
    "then , after tracing out the photonic degrees of freedom from hamiltonian  ( [ 2-quant ] ) , the resulting hamiltonian describes the motion of @xmath24 fermions in the optical lattice of the cavity field , whose depth is proportional to the number of photons @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the degree of localization of the atoms at the minima of the potential wells depends on @xmath27 , and so will the wannier functions in the tight - binding limit .",
    "we now assume that the atoms are well localized at the minima of the potential , and expand the atomic field operators in the tight - binding limit  @xcite in the corresponding wannier functions for the lowest bloch band , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the annihilation operator of a fermion at site @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the wannier function localized at site @xmath30 , and @xmath32 is the number of lattice sites .",

    "this treatment is hence valid in specific parameter regimes , namely when the rate of variation of the photon number , giving the height of the cavity potential , remains smaller than the energy gap between the lowest and the first band , and when the mean number of photons @xmath99 warrants sufficient localization of the atoms , according to the relation @xmath100 we have numerically checked that for @xmath101 ( which coincides with the tight - binding and gaussian approximations ) , the first band gap is larger than the recoil energy .",

    "the atomic density distribution hence enters in determining the strength of the coupling of the atomic fermions to the cavity field , accordingly the height of the cavity potential which finally , closing this nonlinear circle , determines the atomic density distribution itself .",
    "the dependence of the cavity field dynamics on the atomic density is indeed peculiar : at different atomic densities , different behaviours and instabilities of the cavity field are observed .",
    "one could hence conjecture that this system may also exhibit fluctuations and instabilities in the mean number of atoms , in the regime in which this is not fixed , as it could be observed when the gas is put in contact with a particle reservoir .",
    "further interesting outlooks emerge when considering the situation at larger intracavity intensities , in which the atomic polarization is nonlinear in the field . in this case",
    ", this nonlinearity , which corresponds to the one of dispersive optical bistability , adds to the one of the coupling to the motion , and gives rise to a competition between cavity potentials .",
    "in fact , at lower intensities the potential is of the form @xmath162 , while at larger fields it is a superposition of @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "hence , instabilities in the atomic ground states may emerge , which are expected to give rise to novel behaviours .",
    "such rich scenario is indeed exciting and requires different approaches to the study of this problem , which is under current investigation @xcite .",
