    "ever since the discovery of high-@xmath5 superconductivity @xcite spin - fluctuation mediated d - wave singlet pairing has been a major candidate for superconductive pairing in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "already from the start it was realized that the layered cuprates are low dimensional systems with antiferromagnetic undoped parent compounds , with strong electron correlations and with highly unusual normal electron properties .",
    "nevertheless , phonon - mediated strong - coupling s - wave singlet pairing could not be ruled out because of the experimental difficulty to identify essential d - wave signatures which can not also be explained within an s - wave picture .",
    "looking back , it seems that the essential quantitative body of facts , not directly addressing the qualitative question of symmetry , was known already by 1990 . in particular , one early experimental result may be regarded as a clear qualitative signature of d - wave pairing : the so called zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) observed in the i - v characteristics of electron tunneling into thin films of ybacacuo already by .",
    "however , the d - wave connection was not realized at the time ; it was later proposed by and and then experimentally verified by in a study of the magnetic field dependence of the splitting of the zbcp .",
    "a large effort has gone into finding the most significant evidence for d - wave pairing symmetry of the order parameter in the high-@xmath5 cuprates [ see e.g. the review papers by , and and references therein ] .",
    "the problem is nontrivial because it is necessary to distinguish @xmath1-wave symmetry from anisotropic @xmath6-wave symmetry .",
    "a @xmath1-wave order parameter has nodes at four mutually perpendicular directions of the electron momentum .",
    "this provides gapless superconductivity in the direction of the nodes , with normal excitations existing at all energies , having far - reaching consequences for the materials properties of the superconducting state , e.g. linear heat capacity at low temperature , large subgap tunnel current , smeared gap structures and high sensitivity to non - magnetic impurities .",
    "these properties have indeed been found in experiments , from the beginning .",
    "moreover , anisotropic gap structures with deep minima in the node directions have been established in angle resolved photoemission experiments .",
    "the problem is , however , that these experimental facts are also consistent with an anisotropic @xmath6-wave order parameter [ see the review by for an analysis of experimental results ] .    to make an `` experimentum crucius '' one has to establish that the order parameter _",
    "changes sign _ when the momentum rotates by 90 degrees .",
    "such experiments have earlier been suggested by in connection with heavy fermion superconductivity , and first realized in tunneling experiments on high-@xmath5 superconductors by .",
    "the idea behind these experiments is based on the phase sensitive properties of josephson junctions involving @xmath1-wave and @xmath6-wave , or two misoriented @xmath1-wave , superconducting electrodes .",
    "when the junction electrodes have different signs of the order parameter , this is equivalent to adding a @xmath3-shift to the superconducting phase difference across the junction , and therefore the stable state of the junction corresponds to a superconducting phase difference equal to @xmath7 ( @xmath3-junctions ) , instead of @xmath8 like in conventional junctions .    the conceptually simplest way to create a @xmath3-junction is to attach a superconducting loop to two adjacent faces at right angles of a high-@xmath5 single crystal , creating a squid circuit with one @xmath3-junction @xcite . using tri - crystal substrates one can create a superconducting ring consisting of an odd number of @xmath3-junctions which is able to trap half - integer flux quanta .",
    "this was studied by @xcite and kirtley et al .",
    "@xcite who used a scanning squid to detect spontaneous half - integer flux quanta in the @xmath3-junction loop but no flux quanta in rings on bi - crystal interfaces ; for an overview of the subject , see the recent review article by .",
    "this is in principle the definitive experiment , but it is desirable that it can be repeated by other groups .",
    "there is however another type of experiments which may provide direct evidence for @xmath1-wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "these experiments exploit the property of the @xmath1-wave superconductors to form superconducting bound surface states at the fermi energy , so called midgap states , mgs @xcite .",
    "mgs is a direct consequence of the angle - dependent sign change of the order parameter , and it can not exist in @xmath6-wave superconductors . transport measurements which detect the mgs resonance at the fermi energy for particular orientations of the plane of the junction with respect to the crystallographic axes will provide crucial evidence for @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "the problem of mgs is part of a general problem of superconducting surface and interface states and their relation to the andreev states , which determine the transport properties of superconducting junctions .",
    "this is the topic of the present review .",
    "as is well known , at semiconductor and metal surfaces quasiparticle surface states may exist in the band gaps of the bulk material .",
    "the situation is similar at a superconductor surface : the important difference is , however , that on a superconductor surface , electrons are reflected as holes and holes are reflected as electrons - andreev reflection @xcite - while on a normal surface electrons are reflected in the normal way as electrons .",
    "superconducting quasiparticle surface states were first described by for the ins quantum well .",
    "more recently it was found that the superconducting surface states do not need a normal region at the surface and they exist at an arbitrary interface between an s - wave superconductor and an insulator @xcite .",
    "the energy of the surface states lies within the energy gap of the superconductor and it depends on the properties of the surface . in d - wave superconductors , due to the specific symmetry of the order parameter , these levels may occur exactly at the fermi energy @xcite .    in superconducting junctions ,",
    "the overlap of the wave functions of the surface states builds up stationary states at certain energies , the andreev bound states .",
    "these states are thus states of the entire junction , similar to bonding and antibonding states in a molecule or in a system of two closely separated metal surfaces .",
    "the name of these bound states are associated with andreev , who first studied them in perfect sns junctions @xcite . due to their ability to carry current , the andreev bound states play an essential role in dc josephson transport @xcite .",
    "moreover , the surface states in superconductor - normal metal and superconductor - superconductor junctions introduce resonances in the current transport under applied voltage bias .",
    "an important aspect of the superconducting surface states is that they are built up from a combination of electron and hole wave functions .",
    "this mixing is induced by the specific property of the superconductor interface known as _",
    "andreev reflection_.    the problem was originally raised by the observation of an anomalously large thermal resistance of superconductors in the intermediate state @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the enhancement of the thermal resistance was due to some strong additional quasiparticle scattering at the ns interfaces @xcite .",
    "however , no microscopic mechanism for such a reflection was proposed because the spatial variation of the order parameter in the intermediate state is smooth on the scale of the fermi wave length , and it was not clear how such a `` soft '' potential could provide efficient electron reflection .",
    "the problem was solved by andreev who showed that the reflection at ns interfaces is due to electron - hole conversion @xcite .",
    "let us consider a contact between a superconductor and a normal metal , and assume for simplicity that the normal electron properties of both electrodes are identical .",
    "this means that normal electrons will not be reflected by the contact - perfect transmission in the normal state .",
    "however , electrons in the normal electrode which approach the interface with an energy e inside the superconducting gap , @xmath9 , can not penetrate into the superconducting electrode . at the same time , there is no normal scattering process at the interface which is able to reverse the electron momentum .",
    "the problem is solved by converting the incoming electron into a _ reflected hole _ moving with the _ same momentum _ in the opposite direction : since the hole energy is given by @xmath10 , the group velocity is @xmath11 .",
    "such a conversion , andreev reflection , occurs due to electron - hole correlations within the superconducting electrode .",
    "a straightforward quantum mechanical analysis ( see the appendix ) shows that andreev reflection is accompanied by a phase shift @xmath12 , where the upper sign corresponds to the conversion of an electron into a hole , and the lower sign to the inverse process . in this expression",
    ", @xmath13 is the andreev reflection phase shift and @xmath14 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the wave functions of the electrons and holes penetrate into the superconductor over a length of the order of the superconducting coherence length , @xmath15 , and therefore the electron - hole conversion occurs over this distance .",
    "thus , the phase shift during andreev reflection is sensitive to the profile @xmath16 of the superconducting order parameter over a distance of the order of a coherence length near the interface .",
    "calculation of this profile involves self - consistent treatment of the order parameter : however , the properties of the surface states can be qualitatively understood by replacing the exact form of @xmath16 by a step function @xmath17 .",
    "let us now consider the formation of superconducting bound states in an ins quantum well with a specular vacuum / metal ( in ) interface surface .",
    "we will first consider a two - dimensional s - wave superconductor with anisotropic order parameter which has a perfectly transparent normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) interface with a normal layer of width @xmath18 , as shown in . according to quasiclassical arguments",
    ", the bound state corresponds to a closed quasiparticle trajectory , and the bound state energy is given by the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition which requires the total phase accumulated during one cycle to be equal to an integer number of @xmath19 .",
    "the quasiparticle trajectory in ( corresponding to electron motion in the @xmath20-direction ) consists of an electron segment which includes a single reflection at the in interface , and of a hole segment which backwards retraces the electron trajectory .",
    "the total accumulated phase consists of two parts : ( i ) a contribution from the andreev reflections : @xmath21 in the @xmath22-direction and @xmath23 in the @xmath24-direction ( @xmath22 is the angle between the electron trajectory and the surface normal and @xmath25 is the angle after specular normal reflection at the surface ) , and ( ii ) a contribution from the phase @xmath26 accumulated during propagation through the normal region , @xmath27 , where the first term corresponds to the ballistic motion and the second to the reflection at the ni interface .",
    "the electron / hole wave vectors are @xmath28 .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition can then be written down as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and where @xmath31 corresponds to quasiparticle trajectories in the @xmath32 directions .    in the case of a uniform and isotropic order parameter",
    "( @xmath33 ) , equation   reduces to @xmath34 and leads to the spectral equation @xmath35 according to this equation , surface states always exist , even at a simple is interface ( @xmath36 ) due to the normal reflection phase shift @xmath37 in the superconducting electrode @xcite .",
    "in the presence of an ins well , @xmath38 , the ballistic contribution to @xmath26 , @xmath39 , usually dominates , and the dispersion equation takes the form found by , @xmath40 generally , the electron - hole dephasing factor @xmath41 is an odd function of the energy and turns to zero at @xmath42 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the difference between electrons and holes vanishes at the fermi surface . due to this property",
    "there is no @xmath42 solution of equation  , and the density of surface states in s - wave superconductors is zero at the fermi level ; see ( a ) .",
    "moreover , due to the presence of time reversal symmetry in the problem , the surface levels always appear in pairs symmetrically positioned around the fermi level .",
    "the number of surface states for each quasiparticle trajectory is determined by the length of the quasiparticle path , which is given by the normal layer thickness and the propagation angle @xmath22 : for @xmath43 , equation   implies that for normal incidence ( @xmath44 ) there is a single pair of surface states close to the energy gap edge .",
    "a new pair of surface states appear at the gap edge when @xmath45 .",
    "increasing the trajectory angle further pushes these states down into the gap , and a new pair of gap edge states appears every time @xmath46 is increased by @xmath47 .",
    "integration over the angle @xmath22 yields the surface density of states plotted in ( a ) , cf .",
    "reference @xcite .    in anisotropic s - wave superconductors , different gap values before ( @xmath48 ) and after ( @xmath49 ) normal reflection at the surface ( @xmath50 ) will modify the phase shifts of the andreev reflections and change the energy of the surface state .",
    "therefore the surface states depend on how the surface is oriented relative to the crystal axes .",
    "the angle integration will then to a large extent wash out the peaks in the density of states ( dos ) found in ( a ) .",
    "roughness of the interface will lead to further suppression of the peaks in the dos and to the opening of a gap in the spectrum @xcite . in this review",
    "we will however not discuss rough interfaces in any detail .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that for anisotropic superconductors , the total dos within the energy interval @xmath51 , contains , in addition to the bound surface states , contributions from the continuum states .",
    "the surface states are two - fold degenerate , the two states corresponding to different signs of the electron momentum ( @xmath32 ) parallel to the surface . in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the surface",
    ", this degeneracy is removed due to the meissner current : the spectrum calculated above holds in the frame of reference of the condensate . in the laboratory reference",
    "frame the levels are shifted by the doppler term @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the superfluid momentum of the meissner current .",
    "this shift has opposite signs for electrons moving along and against the meissner current .      in the d - wave superconductors , the order parameter is angle dependent , @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 describes the orientation of the order parameter relative to the surface normal",
    "consequently , the gap ( order parameter ) is different before ( @xmath0 ) and after ( @xmath57 ) normal reflection .",
    "as long as @xmath0 and @xmath57 have the same sign , i.e. the same phase , @xmath58 , the situation is not qualitatively different from the anisotropic s - wave case . however , the situation dramatically changes if @xmath0 and @xmath57 have opposite signs , as illustrated in : in this case , the phases @xmath14 and @xmath59 of these order parameters differ by @xmath60 , which leads to a modification of equation  , @xmath61 this equation always has the root @xmath42 since @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this means that for the corresponding angle of incidence , a surface state will appear at zero - energy : this is the so - called midgap state , mgs @xcite .",
    "clearly , this mgs is degenerate with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that for the @xmath64 orientations , an mgs exists for every quasiparticle trajectory , @xmath65 , while for the @xmath66 orientations there are no mgs at all . for arbitrary @xmath56 ,",
    "mgs exist within the window @xmath67 .",
    "the formation of mgs is a robust property of d - wave superconductors : it requires only different signs of @xmath0 and @xmath57 and does not depend on the possible difference in their absolute values .",
    "moreover , the formation of mgs is not sensitive to the spatial variation of @xmath16 ( see [ app_mgs ] ) .",
    "this insensitivity is an important property , because in d - wave superconductors the gap is suppressed by the surface for most orientations of the crystallographic axes .",
    "there is work in the literature addressing the questions of how surface roughness @xcite , impurities @xcite , and nanofaceting of the surfaces / interfaces @xcite affect the mgs .",
    "however , in this review we will focus on clean ballistic structures with specularly reflecting interfaces , and we refer the reader to the original literature ( e.g. the abovementioned papers and references therein )",
    ".    the major effect of taking gap suppression into account will be the presence of additional bound states in the vicinity of the gap edge .",
    "fully self - consistent calculations have been performed by e.g. @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the effect of the surface levels at finite energy can be understood by considering a rectangular sni well of size @xmath68 . for",
    "the sake of illustration , let us consider the @xmath69 orientation for which an mgs exists for every trajectory angle @xmath22 ( see ) .",
    "we then have @xmath70 , and equation   reduces to @xmath71 the resulting density of bound states for a normal metal length @xmath72 is shown in ( b ) .",
    "note that the density of surface states in this figure is only the part of the density of states with @xmath73 , similar to the anisotropic @xmath6-wave case ; there is also a considerable contribution from the extended states of the bulk due to the gap nodes .",
    "the above discussion was focused on mgs at planar surfaces .",
    "however , it is clear that mgs must exist at any defect which produces quasiparticle scattering between states @xmath22 and @xmath24 corresponding to different signs of the order parameter : cracks , twin boundaries , impurities , etc .",
    "thus , a direct measurement of the dos at zero energy by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in the vicinity of an impurity can test the d - wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "such experiments were recently done by , and .",
    "we shall discuss these experiments later , at the end of sec iv , which is devoted to a discussion of current transport through mgs .",
    "another possibility to detect the impurity induced mgs was demonstrated in the experiment by ( ) , where the response to an external magnetic field was studied . in this experiment ,",
    "the mgs were introduced in a @xmath74-oriented ybco film by creating multiple quasi-1d in - plane defects ( ion tracks ) by ion bombardment . by varying the orientation of the ion beam , and",
    "therefore the ion tracks , with respect to the order parameter , it was possible to control the density of mgs . in the experiment ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath75 was measured for different orientations of the defects ( ) .",
    "it was found that for ( 110 ) orientation @xmath75 has a minimum below 15k and increased with decreasing temperature , while for ( 100 ) orientation the low - temperature upturn was much smaller .",
    "this effect can be explained within the above picture by studying the paramagnetic response of mgs to an applied magnetic field @xcite . as was mentioned in ,",
    "the surface states undergo splitting in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the energy of an individual mgs becomes @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the superfluid velocity along the surface of the defect .",
    "since the mgs are localized over a distance much smaller than the penetration depth ( @xmath78 ) , the nonhomogeneity of the superflow can be neglected .",
    "the mgs current per @xmath79-plane along the surface is @xmath80 and also over @xmath81 , @xmath82 . at zero temperature ,",
    "@xmath83 , only the negative energy levels ( @xmath84 ) , which carry paramagnetic current , are occupied , which leads to a total current @xmath85 at the defect [ for ( 110 ) orientation ] . by dividing this equation by @xmath1 , the average distance between the defects , we get the average density of the paramagnetic mgs current . at finite temperature ,",
    "the positive energy levels carrying diamagnetic current also become occupied , which leads to a reduction of the paramagnetic effect . when @xmath86 , expansion of the fermi function and integration over @xmath81 yield a @xmath87-dependence for the average mgs current density , @xmath88 .",
    "this paramagnetic current is to be added to the paramagnetic current of the quasiparticles in the bulk of d - wave superconductor , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the density of quasiparticles which linearly depends on the temperature , @xmath91 , at @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the electron density ) .",
    "this interplay of the bulk quasiparticle current and the mgs current produces the low - temperature anomaly of the magnetic penetration depth observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the effect is most pronounced for ( 110 ) orientation , and disappears for ( 100 ) orientation of the defects because of the absence of mgs in the latter case . in the experiment",
    ", the effect did actually not disappear for the ( 100 ) orientation , but was a minimum .",
    "the finite value was explained to be due to mgs at internal interfaces in the film , e.g. grain boundaries .",
    "although the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the gap necessarily leads to the formation of mgs , the resulting large density of states at the fermi level is actually energetically unfavorable : any mechanism able to split the mgs and produce a gap in the spectrum will lower the energy of the system @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms splitting the mgs have been proposed in the literature : ( 1 ) splitting due to a subdominant component of the order parameter which forms a local complex @xmath94 gap parameter at the surface , ( 2 ) self - induced doppler shifts , and ( 3 ) formation of spin - density wave near the surface .",
    "we shall here discuss the first two mechanisms in greater detail , while for the third scenario , we refer to the original literature @xcite .      for orientations where the @xmath1-wave gap is suppressed and at low temperatures , a subdominant gap of @xmath6 or @xmath95 symmetry may appear near the surface if a weak secondary interaction ( additional to the one responsible for the @xmath1-wave superconductivity ) is present @xcite . in a self - consistent picture ,",
    "the complex combination @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) is energetically favorable .",
    "the mgs is sensitive to the presence of this subdominant gap ; to demonstrate this , let us consider the order parameter @xmath98 with the @xmath1-wave component having @xmath69 orientation .",
    "we now define a relative phase angle @xmath99 . in this case , the scattering phase shift during andreev reflection has the additional contribution @xmath100 for @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for @xmath84 . in a symmetric case with @xmath103 , we get the following modification of equation   at low energies : @xmath104 the effect of this @xmath32-dependent contribution from the relative phase is to shift the mgs away from the fermi level to the edges of the subdominant gap , @xmath105 and the @xmath32 degeneracy of the mgs is lifted .",
    "this splitting of the mgs is a result of the broken time - reversal symmetry in the @xmath106 state .",
    "the mgs splitting drives the instability ( lowers the energy of the system ) which appears at a critical temperature determined by the strength of the subdominant interaction .",
    "each bound state carries current parallel to the surface in the direction given by @xmath81 , which means that at low temperatures , when only the state below the fermi energy is occupied [ the one labeled by @xmath20 for @xmath107 in equation  ] , a net surface current will be present .",
    "this spontaneous current manifests the broken time - reversal symmetry of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the trsb state is two - fold degenerate : the gap parameter can be either @xmath108 or @xmath109 , corresponding to the two possible directions of the spontaneous surface current .",
    "the spectrum of surface states in @xmath108 superconductors has a close similarity to the spectrum in a b - phase @xmath110-wave superconductor . in the light of the above discussion",
    ", it is therefore straightforward to understand the results obtained by .",
    "the b - phase gap parameter in a two - dimensional @xmath110-wave superconductor can be written @xmath111 ( @xmath112 for down / up spins ) , see e.g. the book by .",
    "this gap function is similar to the @xmath108 case above , but with a propagation - angle - dependent magnitude of the imaginary component @xmath113 .",
    "thus , there are surface bound states also for @xmath110-wave superconductors ; however , the bound state is located at the fermi level only for quasiparticles propagating perpendicular to the surface ( @xmath44 ) , since the gap is real ( and changes sign at the normal reflection event ) only for this particular propagation angle . integrating over the injection angle , we find that the density of states is finite for all subgap energies , and there is no zero energy peak @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the density of bound surface states of @xmath110-wave and @xmath1-wave superconductors are quite different , although the mechanism of the bound state formation is the same .      in connection with the discussion of the paramagnetic effect",
    ", discovered that the mgs are unstable , even in the absence of any subdominant interaction ( pure @xmath1-wave order parameter ) , due to a possibility of creation of spontaneous magnetic fields . as we discussed in the previous section , a splitting of mgs yields a surface current at low temperature .",
    "this current creates a magnetic field which is screened by a supercurrent counterflow which , in turn , further splits the mgs due to the doppler shift effect discussed in .",
    "the effect saturates when the magnetic energy compensates for the energy of the doppler shifted mgs .",
    "thus , a time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) state spontaneously occurs , with a surface current due to the split mgs and a self - consistent screening current upholding the doppler shifts at a phase transition temperature @xmath114 @xcite which is much smaller than the critical temperature of the type - ii superconductors ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "in this section we shall discuss how , from a theoretical point of view , mgs influence the dc josephson effect .",
    "first , we develop the concept of andreev bound states and explain how they in many cases determine the properties of josephson junctions .",
    "then we discuss some particular junction orientations which illustrate some effects peculiar for josephson junctions of @xmath1-wave superconductors : large josephson currents proportional to @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is the junction transparency ) , @xmath87 dependence ( @xmath117 is the temperature ) of the josephson critical current , @xmath3-junction formation , @xmath118 junction crossovers with temperature , and spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) .",
    "when two superconducting electrodes are connected to form a junction , the superconducting surface states form coherent bound states of the entire junction , andreev bound states .",
    "there is an obvious analogy with a double well system .",
    "the structure of the andreev state is illustrated in .",
    "like the surface states , the andreev state consists of a combination of electron and hole wave functions with opposite electron momenta @xmath119 ( momentum @xmath81 parallel to the specular surface is conserved ) .",
    "the analogy with the double well system allows us to expect that the andreev levels will be split and shifted with respect to the surface levels , the shift depending ( i ) on the transparency of the tunnel barrier separating the electrodes and ( ii ) on the superconducting phase difference across the junction . taking into account the phase dispersion of the energy ( @xmath120 ) of the andreev levels",
    ", one may talk about andreev bands @xmath121 with width ( dispersion ) proportional to the junction transparency @xmath116 .",
    "however , if the surface states at the two sides of the junction have equal energies , the coupling becomes resonant . in this _ resonant _ case , the splitting of the levels , and therefore the width of the andreev band , will be particularly large and proportional to @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the width of the andreev band determines the critical josephson current , and the andreev band dispersion determines the josephson current - phase relation .",
    "one might expect the surface states to be degenerate in junctions fabricated with the same superconducting material ; however , even in this case the degeneracy can be lifted due to several types of asymmetries , e.g. misorientation of the order parameters , difference in spatial modulation of the the order parameters , etc .",
    "the derivation of the spectral equation for the andreev states is more involved than the derivation of the spectrum of surface states .",
    "the properties of the andreev levels can therefore not be strictly deduced from simple quasiclassical arguments but rather require solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation @xcite . however , the spectral equation can be presented in terms of the earlier introduced phase shifts @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) and @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) in the left ( l ) and right ( r ) electrodes of the junction , and the superconducting phase difference @xmath127 .",
    "we here choose to define the andreev reflection phase @xmath128 for negative @xmath0 as @xmath129 .",
    "the spectral equation then becomes @xmath130 where @xmath131 ; @xmath132 ; @xmath133 .",
    "describes hybridization of the surface states .",
    "this is obvious if one lets the transparency @xmath134 , in which case one recovers equation   for decoupled surface states .",
    "however , equation   can also be interpreted as hybridization of andreev states present in the corresponding perfectly transparent junction ( @xmath135 ) due to normal electron back scattering at the insulating barrier .",
    "the spectral equation for andreev states in perfectly transparent junctions actually follows from quasiclassical arguments : @xmath136 where the first and second lines correspond to the decoupled @xmath22 and @xmath24 segments in .      since andreev reflection",
    "is accompanied by charge transfer through the nis interface , the andreev states are able to carry current .",
    "the current through the surface states is blocked in the direction perpendicular to the surface due to complete quasiparticle reflection from the insulator . in the nis junction , this insulating interface becomes transmissive , and the current may flow through the andreev states . there is a general relation between the current through the andreev state and the phase dispersion of the energy of the andreev state , @xmath137 this equation can be derived directly from the bdg equation @xcite or deduced from the thermodynamical equation @xmath138 by using a microscopic expression for the junction free energy @xcite .",
    "the total josephson current of the bound states per unit surface area , per @xmath79-plane , flowing perpendicular to the surface is @xmath139 where the angle brackets denote integration over the trajectory angle @xmath22 , @xmath140 the josephson current in d - wave junctions strongly depends on the orientation of the order parameters in the electrodes with respect to the junction interface .",
    "the whole picture is quite complex , however one can distinguish three qualitatively different cases : ( i ) no mgs at any side of the junction , ( ii ) mgs at both sides of the junction , and ( iii ) mgs at one side of the junction . for arbitrary orientation all three cases may occur for different sectors of the trajectory angle @xmath22 , and the total",
    "current is a weighted sum of currents of the three types . in a pure form ,",
    "the first case is realized in @xmath141 junctions where the situation is similar to @xmath6-wave junctions : no suppression of the order parameter , and the two andreev bound states which dominate the josephson current are situated close to the gap edges and have dispersion of order @xmath116 .",
    "the second case is realized in a pure form in @xmath142 junctions . in this case , the central phenomenon is the _ resonant coupling of mgs _ which produces large current proportional to @xmath115 with rather special properties . we choose to illustrate the third case by the @xmath143 junction .",
    "the peculiarity of this case is the time - reversal symmetry breaking , trsb .",
    "in many works , e.g. @xcite , it has been assumed that tunneling occurs only for normal incidence , @xmath44 .",
    "this is motivated by the discriminating effect of the _ tunneling cone _ @xcite . however , in order to include the effects of mgs it is very important actually to take a wide tunneling cone @xmath144 into account , since tunneling through mgs only occurs at finite angles of incidence . ignoring this point , one might conclude that the josephson current is zero , or at least small , for the @xmath145 orientation since @xmath146 .",
    "however , this will be true only for a cone very strongly peaked around @xmath44 , since the mgs contribution for finite cone angle is resonant .",
    "clearly , the exact functional dependence of the current on orientation will be sensitive to the actual shape of the cone and not only to the value of the junction transparency @xmath147 . throughout this review we use a @xmath148-function model for the barrier . in this case",
    "the cone is quite wide , @xmath149 [ see e.g. @xcite ] , and the effects of mgs are somewhat overemphasized .",
    "an exception is the treatment of the @xmath143 orientation below , where we instead follow reference @xcite and use a wide barrier model which has @xmath150 , where @xmath151 determines the width of the cone and is a function of the barrier height and width @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case the mgs contribution will dominate at low temperature , as discussed below .",
    "the order parameter for this orientation is strongly suppressed by the surface ; however , the qualitative properties of mgs in junctions with low transparency @xmath154 are not sensitive to the detailed profile of the order parameter , which allows us to consider the rectangular well model .    for this high - symmetry orientation , the four gaps in equation   have equal magnitudes , @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath3 shift at both sides is picked up at @xmath24 ( andreev reflecting against a negative lobe of the order parameter ) .",
    "the spectral equation takes the form @xmath156 which , for small energies @xmath157 and negligible dephasing ( @xmath158 ) , has the solution @xcite @xmath159 plotted in ( a ) .",
    "the current of these two mgs is calculated via equation  . at zero temperature , only the level below zero energy is populated while the level above is empty , and the current is @xmath160 the critical ( maximum ) josephson current is proportional to @xmath115 @xcite and is much larger than the ambegaokar - baratoff critical current in non - resonant s - wave tunnel junctions , which is proportional to @xmath116 @xcite . in ( b ) , we plot the current - phase relation at low temperature .",
    "note that the @xmath115-behavior is a general phenomenon connected with resonance coupling @xcite .    to understand the basic temperature dependence of the current , we notice that the two mgs energies @xmath161 carry currents in opposite directions , @xmath162 , and",
    "therefore with increasing population of the upper level at large temperature , the current carried by mgs will decrease , @xmath163 the scale of the temperature dependence of the current is set by the well - defined energy difference of the two - level mgs system .",
    "when @xmath164 , the expansion @xmath165 leads to a @xmath87 dependence of the current @xcite , @xmath166    in tunnel junctions , the current carried by mgs dominates at low temperature @xmath167 because the continuum state current is proportional to the junction transparency @xmath116 . due to suppression of the gap at the interface",
    ", there are also andreev states near the gap edges which may carry large currents due to degeneracy of the corresponding surface states .",
    "however , the net current of these states is also of order @xmath116 since they form pairs far below the fermi level which are almost equally populated .",
    "the currents carried by the two bound states of the pair flow in opposite directions and cancel each other .",
    "thus we conclude that the critical current @xmath153 scales with temperature as @xmath87 for low temperatures , as clearly seen in ( the solid line ) . in the limit @xmath168 ,",
    "the @xmath169 dependence approaches a maximum value @xmath170 , c.f .",
    "equation  .      from a technical point of view , this case is very similar to the previous one , the difference being that the @xmath3 shift at the right side is now picked up at @xmath22 rather than at @xmath24 ( because the positive and negative lobes of the order parameter have changed places ) .",
    "this results in a phase shift @xmath172 in equation   which now reads @xmath173 with the mgs solution ( riedel and bagwell , 1998 ) @xmath174 the mgs band again has a large dispersion proportional to @xmath175 ; however , the phase dependence is @xmath3 shifted compared to the @xmath145 junctions [ see ( c ) ] .",
    "the current - phase relation will therefore also be @xmath3-shifted [ c.f .",
    "( d ) ] which puts the minimum of the junction energy at a phase difference equal to @xmath3 instead of @xmath152 , corresponding to a @xmath3-junction .",
    "this fact was used in the tri - crystal ring experiments , although the theoretical idea behind the experiment put forward by and later on by was based on symmetry arguments and not on the microscopic picture outlined here .",
    "again , the critical current has the low - temperature anomaly , @xmath169 and approaches a maximum value @xmath170 at zero temperature , ( dashed line in ) . to emphasize the @xmath3-junction behavior , we let the critical current be negative in this case .",
    "we are now able to discuss general properties of the josephson current in symmetric junctions @xmath176 ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion . in these junctions ,",
    "mgs exist only within certain limited intervals of the angle @xmath22 while for other angles , the andreev level spectrum is similar to the one in s - wave junctions and the corresponding currents follow the ambegaokar - baratoff law . at low temperature , the mgs will dominate and the equilibrium phase difference is , as in the @xmath171 case , at @xmath177 .",
    "however , at larger temperatures this contribution will be suppressed and the non - mgs current may dominate . this @xmath6-wave type current will give a minimum of the junction energy at @xmath178 .",
    "hence , with increase of the temperature , the junction will undergo a transition from a @xmath3-junction to an ordinary junction @xcite .",
    "the critical current is zero at the transition temperature where there is detailed balance between the mgs current and the @xmath6-wave like current .",
    "we illustrate this behavior with the @xmath179 junction , the dot - dashed line in .",
    "development of a subdominant s - wave order parameter near the junction interface leads to an interesting modification of the low - temperature anomaly of the critical current . as we earlier discussed , in the presence of a complex order parameter @xmath181 the mgs are split into two states @xmath182 , where the sign depends on the sign of the @xmath81 wave vector .",
    "thus the andreev spectrum presented in will move either up or down ( for opposite signs of @xmath81 ) as soon as the subdominant gap @xmath183 appears and grows with decreasing temperature .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath184 where the effect is most pronounced . in this case",
    ", the andreev bands do not cross the fermi level at @xmath83 ; the lower pair of levels is then fully occupied , while the upper one is empty and therefore does not contribute to the current .",
    "this leads to an uncompensated @xmath185-current along the interface .",
    "large @xmath186-currents carried by the occupied levels flow in opposite directions and cancel each other , leading to a small ( for @xmath154 ) residual current proportional to the first power of the junction transparency @xmath116 .",
    "this residual current has positive sign , similar to the common situation in @xmath6-wave sis and sns junctions @xcite , and therefore the @xmath3-junction property is lost .",
    "thus the josephson current undergoes a crossover from @xmath3-junction to @xmath152-junction when the temperature decreases , and the critical current has a non - monotonic temperature dependence and turns to zero at the crossover point @xcite , see .",
    "experimental observation of such _ reentrant _ temperature dependence of the critical current would be a direct evidence of the subdominant order parameter .      for the @xmath143 orientation ,",
    "there are mgs only at one side of the junction corresponding to the non - resonant case .",
    "the spatial shapes of the order parameters are different at the two sides of the junction which also leads to non - resonant coupling of the non - mgs surface states . to understand the type of bound states present in this junction",
    ", we solve the spectral equation for the injection angle @xmath187 when all four @xmath1-wave gaps involved have equal magnitudes @xmath188 .",
    "the spectral equation then takes the form [ @xmath189 @xmath190 where the different signs correspond to quasiparticle states with @xmath191 .",
    "the solution for @xmath158 is given by @xmath192 there are two andreev bands for a given @xmath81 , the mgs band and the band at the gap edge ( riedel and bagwell , 1998 ) .",
    "the dispersion of the mgs band is proportional to @xmath116 at low transparency , @xmath193 while the dispersion of the andreev band at the gap edge is much smaller , proportional to @xmath194 .",
    "is a good approximation for all injection angles in the low transparency limit when the mgs are well inside the gap , close to zero .    for the orientations discussed in the previous sections , the mgs spectrum is degenerate with respect to @xmath32 : in other words , there is a pair of mgs , @xmath161 , for every @xmath81 . in the present case , however ,",
    "this degeneracy is lifted as emphasized in ( a ) .",
    "inspection of the mgs wave functions for phase differences between @xmath152 and @xmath3 shows that , at large distance from the interface , the @xmath195 wave function decays only for @xmath20 , while for @xmath196 it grows exponentially . for the @xmath197 wave function",
    "the situation is the opposite : the wave function decays for @xmath196 and grows exponentially for @xmath20 .",
    "this difference between the two time - reversed states labeled by @xmath32 is a consequence of the sign difference between the @xmath1-wave lobes and is the key point in understanding the possibility of spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking ( see below ) .",
    "the current in the @xmath143 junction is @xmath3-periodic , as opposed to the usual @xmath19-periodicity , as was first theoretically predicted in @xcite and later on measured in experiments by . for low temperature",
    "the mgs band dominates the current - phase relation plotted in ( b ) and the bound states in equation   give @xmath198 .",
    "however , for large temperatures @xmath153 will be negligibly small already for temperatures of the order @xmath199 , in contrast to the @xmath145 case where this happens for temperatures of the order @xmath200 .",
    "this difference is a result of the larger energy scale given by the large dispersion of the bound states ( @xmath201 ) in the resonant @xmath145 case compared to the much smaller dispersion ( @xmath202 ) in the non - resonant @xmath143 case .",
    "the current through the junction is zero for the phase differences @xmath203 .",
    "however , the minimum junction energy is achieved for @xmath204 , since the mgs energy is the lowest for these phase differences . due to the uneven occupation of mgs with opposite signs of @xmath81 , the current parallel to the interface",
    "is finite even in equilibrium , see ( c ) .",
    "for example at @xmath205 , only mgs with positive @xmath81 are occupied and a surface current is flowing in the positive @xmath185-direction .",
    "the opposite happens for @xmath206 .",
    "remembering that the state with @xmath196 is obtained from the @xmath20 state by the time - reversal operation , and noting that there is no way of taking the time - reversed state to the original one by adding an integer number of @xmath19 to @xmath207 , we must conclude that time - reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken at the @xmath143 junction .",
    "this fact is manifested by the finite surface current , which produces a magnetic field at the junction .    the josephson energy gain for @xmath204 is partly compensated by the energy cost of setting up the meissner screening currents which ensure that the spontaneous magnetic field vanishes in the bulk superconductors far from the junction . by calculating the thermodynamic potential for the junction system",
    "@xcite it can be shown that the trsb state really is favorable .",
    "if the orientation is not exactly @xmath143 , the equilibrium phase difference @xmath208 is shifted from @xmath209 . however , the trsb effect ( i.e. @xmath210 or @xmath3 ) remains for deviations up to about @xmath211 @xcite from the @xmath143 orientation .",
    "since there are screening currents flowing , we may expect doppler shift effects . for transparencies",
    "@xmath212 , the dispersion of the mgs with phase difference , given by equation  , is much larger than the doppler shifts ; these can therefore be neglected and the picture outlined above holds .",
    "however , for @xmath213 the doppler shifts dominate , and the problem is formally the same as mgs at a free surface discussed in .",
    "the above discussion of the @xmath143 junction , including the crossover to the doppler shift driven trsb surface instability , closely follows the one presented in the paper by .",
    "the possibility of trsb in purely @xmath1-wave junctions was first pointed out by for the pin hole geometry , which is equivalent to having @xmath135 .",
    "many people , using different theoretical tools , have considered the @xmath143 junction : by using ginzburg - landau theories @xcite or quasiclassical green s function techniques @xcite , or by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xcite . however , the final results are qualitatively the same : @xmath3-periodic current - phase relation and the possibility of spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "there is however one important difference : the absence ( as above ) or presence of a subdominant component of the order parameter at the junction .",
    "we conclude that broken time - reversal symmetry at a @xmath143 josephson junction will not give any evidence for the presence of a subdominant component , since the @xmath1-wave order parameter alone enforces broken symmetry .    in experiments reported by and",
    "fractional fluxes were found at grain - boundaries with the @xmath143 orientation .",
    "if time - reversal symmetry is broken as described above , spontaneous surface currents offer a possible explanation for these experiments , see @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite proposed an explanation in terms of randomly distributed facets along the grain - boundary , where each facet may have equilibrium phase difference @xmath152 or @xmath3 depending on whether zero , one or two lobes with negative sign of the @xmath1-wave order parameter point towards the junction",
    ". when the phase difference varies along the grain - boundary , formation of fractional fluxes may be energetically favorable .",
    "it should be noted that this model assumes a simple @xmath214 dependence of the current - phase relation , and does not take into account the formation of mgs at the junction .",
    "there is an interesting similarity between the josephson effect in the @xmath145 junctions and in @xmath141 junctions with resonant states in the tunnel barrier . in the presence in the tunnel transparency of a narrow breit - wigner resonance close to the fermi level ,",
    "the andreev level spectrum has the form found in the @xmath6-wave case @xcite , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the position and @xmath217 is the width of the resonance , @xmath218 . if the resonance is exactly at the fermi level , @xmath219 , the spectrum becomes @xmath220 which is the spectrum of an sns - junction ( @xmath135 ) with @xmath221 , having dispersion @xmath217 instead of @xmath48 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the current is then given by @xmath222    the temperature dependence of the critical current in this case is then also @xmath169 for @xmath223 .",
    "thus , while interpreting experimental results it is useful to have in mind that the low - temperature anomaly of the critical current is a fingerprint of a resonant state at the fermi level rather than indication of the @xmath1-wave symmetry , although this resonance ( mgs ) could be due to the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "an important class of experimental studies involves the determination of the critical josephson current in current - biased artificial grain boundary ( gb ) junctions @xmath224 by varying the orientation angles @xmath225 and @xmath226 of the order parameters @xcite .",
    "consider a _",
    "experiment where we may freely rotate the order parameters of the left ( @xmath225 ) and right ( @xmath226 ) superconducting electrodes , and also independently vary the transparency @xmath116 of the interface barrier ( i ) ( figure  [ andreev_state_fig ] ) , creating ideal @xmath224 junctions : how will the josephson current develop in different situations ?",
    "starting with an ideal @xmath141 gb junction , there is no mgs , and the josephson current @xmath202 is due to non - resonant transport through the interface barrier .",
    "if we now rotate the order parameter symmetrically away from @xmath227 to @xmath69 , keeping @xmath116 fixed , the @xmath176 the junction will develop mgs , and the critical current will then cross over from @xmath116 to @xmath115 dependence because of resonant transport through mgs .",
    "the resulting current enhancement can become very large ( `` giant josephson current '' ) if the transparency is low , @xmath154 , and the @xmath228 product will be enhanced by @xmath229 over the ambegaokar - baratoff limit characterizing @xmath141 tunnel junctions .    in reality one must rotate the order parameter by rotating the lattice .",
    "this necessarily leads to an interface barrier , the strength of which increases with misorientation angle ( up to @xmath230 for tetragonal symmetry ) .",
    "assuming that the thickness of the barrier increases with misorientation angle , the result will be exponentially decreasing transparency and narrowing of the tunneling cone . with decreasing transparency , the low - temperature region where mgs are important will decrease ( @xmath231 for resonant mgs ) .",
    "these effects may seriously reduce the weight of the mgs contribution .",
    "therefore , in real experiments , the role of mgs will depend on the detailed properties of the junction .",
    "it should be noted that if we continue to rotate the structure with the order parameters to reach the @xmath171 limit , there is no longer any lattice mismatch , and therefore no interface barrier .",
    "the full presence of mgs therefore can not be achieved in this type of experiment : to really observe the effects of mgs , one must fabricate @xmath232 junctions with separately controlled tunnel barriers .",
    "in real high-@xmath5 gb junctions , the @xmath228 product decreases strongly with increasing misorientation angle . in the absence of mgs",
    ", one would expect this product to be constant , but it is experimentally often found that @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the normal resistance per unit area @xcite .",
    "an explanation , due to , is that coulomb blockade prevents resonant josephson current but allows resonant normal current transport through the levels in the barrier .",
    "we suggest that this behavior can also be explained in terms of a constant spectral density of normal levels with resonance widths @xmath217 inside the barrier . from the discussion in , we know that for a resonance with energy @xmath235 , equation ( [ ss_rescurr ] ) gives a resonantly enhanced josephson current @xmath236 , while for resonances with @xmath237 the current is negligibly small .",
    "the contribution to the total current then comes from a spectral region of width @xmath217 around @xmath42 , with the results @xmath238 .",
    "the normal current , on the other hand , is resonantly enhanced in the entire spectral region , giving @xmath239 .    in a recent paper , have investigated the properties of the josephson current in ramp - edge junctions with @xmath240 overall misorientation angle , varying the orientation of the interface ( and therefore @xmath241 ) to vary the role of mgs . in particular ,",
    "the dependence of the critical current on temperature has been experimentally investigated and fitted to d - wave theoretical results for short @xmath242 junctions with high transparency , d=0.5 - 0.8 , which implies that the dispersion of the mgs is a large fraction of the gap .",
    "to get agreement with experiment for @xmath168 , introduced life - time broadening of the mgs ( describing effects of rough interfaces and inelastic scattering ) via an imaginary part of the energy , which strongly reduces @xmath243 and the @xmath228 product at low temperatures , changing the sign of the curvature and leading to saturation of @xmath243 .",
    "the final good qualitative agreement between theory and experiment is consistent with the presence of life - time broadened mgs in a high - transparency junction .",
    "it should be noted , however , that even if the transparency for superconductive transport seems high , an estimate of the experimental _ average _ transparency , based on the junction resistance ( @xmath244 ) and area ( number of planes and transport channels ) , gives a fairly low value , around @xmath245 .",
    "we suggest that the simplest explanation for this difference is that transport takes place through highly transparent point contacts in the junction barrier . in this picture , the temperature dependence of the critical josephson current becomes a measure of the true transparency ( @xmath246 ) , which together with the normal resistance also becomes a measure of the effective transport area of the junction .    for a more definitive analysis",
    "it is desirable to compare experimental and theoretical results for a larger set of misorientation angles and transparencies . to this end",
    "we have calculated @xmath243 for high transparency , @xmath247 [ @xmath248 , as in the original fit by ] , neglecting mgs broadening .",
    "we have considered the high - symmetry orientations @xmath141 and @xmath171 , as well for the intermediate orientation @xmath249 considered by .",
    "the result is shown in . in the case of @xmath141 orientation ( no mgs ) we find that @xmath243 has a weak negative curvature , while in the case of @xmath171 orientation ( mgs is present ) we find a weak positive curvature of @xmath243 .",
    "thus , within our model the positive curvature is characteristic for the presence of mgs , while the negative curvature is characteristic for the absence of mgs .",
    "the strong positive curvature in the case of the @xmath249 orientation in may look a bit surprising : in fact , only at low temperatures does the @xmath87-dependence signify mgs ; at higher temperatures it results from a competition between the nearly - linear mgs contribution and contributions of opposite sign from the continuum and gap - edge states .",
    "thus , theoretically , positive curvature of @xmath243 at low temperatures is a fingerprint of mgs .",
    "however , such a picture needs to be verified by systematic experimental and theoretical investigations , and the picture may be complicated .",
    "for example , the recent studies of gb junctions by show clear positive @xmath243 curvatures for nominally @xmath141 orientations , and such behavior is also evident in the review by , perhaps due to orientational disorder like meandering and faceting",
    ".    also studied the magnetic field dependence of the critical josephson current , finding evidence for @xmath250 behavior .",
    "this might be evidence for @xmath143 symmetry , but may also be due to the high transparency ( saw - tooth - like dependence of the @xmath251 current - phase relation ) .",
    "we conclude that so far , the role of well - defined mgs is difficult to identify with certainty in studies of the critical josephson current in d / d grain - boundary or ramp - edge junctions , although most likely have taken an important step in the right direction . in order directly to observe the presence of mgs one may have to use low - transparency tunnel junctions and utilize energy - resolving probes , e.g looking for mgs in the form of characteristic features in i - v characteristics of voltage biased junctions .",
    "since the discovery of tunneling in ns junctions @xcite , and the explanation of the phenomenon on the basis of the tunnel hamiltonian model @xcite , it is commonly accepted that the tunneling conductance essentially measures the superconductor density of states ( dos ) .",
    "hence , tunnel spectroscopy provides a direct means of detecting the mgs , which should show up as a large conductance peak centered at zero bias .",
    "this zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) has indeed been observed ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "see also the recent reviews by and @xcite .",
    "we start this section by discussing the theory of tunneling through mgs .",
    "we will discuss two different transport mechanisms : direct tunneling , and tunneling involving andreev reflection .",
    "the tunnel model is usually exploited for calculation of direct tunneling , while andreev reflection is usually described by means of scattering theory .",
    "we will compare the two approaches and show that depending on the relation between the junction transparency and the mgs intrinsic broadening , the mgs resonance may appear either in the single particle current or in the pair current . in the end",
    "we discuss tunnel experiments on ns junctions and also the recent stm investigations of impurity bound states .      in the tunnel model , the angle - resolved local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath252 and @xmath253 are calculated on the left(l ) and right(r ) sides of the junction , and then the tunnel formula @xmath254 \\rho_l(\\theta , e)\\rho_r(\\theta , e+ev),\\ ] ] is employed to calculate the current .",
    "the total current is obtained by angle integration @xmath255 , and the conductance is then found by differentiation with respect to the bias voltage @xmath256 . since the density of states ( dos ) in the normal metal is approximately energy independent near the fermi surface , in the zero temperature limit the conductance will be reduced to @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the ldos in the superconductor .    for the @xmath227 orientation of the order parameter , there is no mgs and the angle resolved ldos is the same as in the bulk @xmath259 [ see e.g. references  @xcite ] .",
    "the tunnel formula gives a conductance which in the zero temperature limit is simply the bulk dos corrected by the angle dependent transparency @xmath260 of the tunnel barrier , @xmath261 for other orientations , the conductance will measure ldos at the surface rather than the bulk dos . for the @xmath69 orientation , neglecting gap suppression and surface roughness , the ldos is given by @xcite @xmath262 the high spectral weight at the gap edges has moved down to zero energy and formed the mgs , and the tunnel conductance will contain a peak at zero voltage .",
    "the delta - function singularity is usually removed by introducing broadening via an imaginary part @xmath263 of the energy representing some relaxation mechanism .",
    "this damping @xmath263 determines the width of the mgs resonance .",
    "this interpretation of the conductance spectra in terms of single - particle ( quasiparticle ) current , see ( a ) , assumes that all states in the electrodes form reservoirs , i.e. their relaxation times are assumed short enough to ensure equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for the extended states of the continuum , while for the mgs , lying deep within the superconducting gap , it requires special consideration .",
    "if the mgs are true bound states without coupling to the bulk of the superconductor , i.e. intrinsically very narrow , then current transport through the mgs is only possible via the andreev process , see ( b ) .",
    "the equation for the current then reads @xmath264 where @xmath265 and @xmath266 are the single - particle ( quasiparticle ) and two - particle ( andreev ) currents respectively .",

    "later on , , and generalized the theory to the @xmath1-wave case ; see also @xcite . at zero temperature , in the low - transparency limit",
    ", we have for the @xmath69 orientation @xmath267 and the two - particle current takes the form @xmath268 the total current is obtained by integration over angles and energies @xmath269\\left[i_1(\\theta , e)+i_2(\\theta , e)\\right]\\right>\\ ] ] the two - particle current contains a breit - wigner resonance of width @xmath270 , the mgs , and @xmath271 as soon as @xmath272 .",
    "hence , the two - particle current is resonantly enhanced near zero bias ( it is of the same order as the single - particle current ) , which produces a zero - bias conductance peak .",
    "the current - voltage and conductance - voltage relations calculated within the scattering approach are plotted in .",
    "consider now the ratio @xmath273 between the life time due to leakage to the normal reservoir through the barrier , @xmath274 , and the life time due to inelastic relaxation , @xmath275 , which couple the mgs with the bulk superconductor , @xmath276 clearly this life - time ratio will determine whether the mgs will participate in current transport via the single - particle process ( for large damping ; @xmath277 ) , or via the two - particle process ( for small damping ; @xmath278 ) .",

    ", one would expect that also @xmath283 .",
    "however , it can be shown that the single - particle current gives a large negative contribution to the excess current : this cancels the enhanced two - particle current and leaves an excess current which for all orientations is proportional to @xmath194 in the low - transparency limit , just like in the low - temperature superconductors .",
    "this implies that the excess current will not be a true measure of the importance of the andreev reflection process as soon as there are resonances ( like the mgs ) in the junction .",
    "experimentally , the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) has been studied for many years : it was observed by already in @xcite . in the early years , when the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the order parameter had not been established , the peak was explained in terms of a spin - flip scattering model developed by and . following the paper by",
    ", attention was drawn to the mgs scenario .",
    "one of the first good fits between experiments and the @xmath1-wave theory ( mgs , ) was presented by .",
    "today , a number of experiments have given quite convincing evidence that the mgs picture offers the best explanation .",
    "here we shall discuss some experimental findings regarding the influence of ( 1 ) magnetic field and ( 2 ) orientation and disorder on the mgs and zbcp .",
    "yet another class of experiments have been performed recently , namely stm measurements of mgs bound to point impurities .",
    "these experiments will be discussed in below .      the doppler shift effect mentioned in",
    "was confirmed experimentally by and may be regarded as the first successful attempt to seriously discriminate between the mgs and the spin flip scattering scenarios for the zbcp .",
    "the effect was further studied by and , see .",
    "the zbcp was observed to split linearly with @xmath284 up to @xmath285 , where vortices enter the superconductor and the shift saturates @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the spin - flip model could be ruled out since the land @xmath286-factor involved in the zeeman type splitting in this case had to be very large in order to fit the experiment .    in the zero - field limit @xmath287 ,",
    "splitting of the zbcp was still observed by and and also by and .",
    "this was interpreted as a sign of spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking at the surface and evidence for a local presence of a subdominant @xmath6-wave component , c.f . above .",
    "however , a spontaneous ( zero - field ) splitting of the zbcp is not always seen @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are other possible explanations for the splitting than the one involving a subdominant @xmath6-wave component of the order parameter ; see the discussion of split mgs in .",
    "also , if for any reason particle - hole symmetry is broken in the superconductor , the mgs may also be split . for the identification of the mechanism responsible for the spontaneous splitting of the zbcp",
    "the same arguments as for the identification of the origin of the zbcp are relevant : one needs to measure the response to some controllable perturbation ; e.g. the magnetic field response of the zbcp discussed above confirmed that mgs are responsible for the zbcp .",
    "since such experiments are lacking for the spontaneously split zbcp , we feel that at the present time the existence of a trsb @xmath108 surface state remains controversial .      as explained above , if we probe an @xmath69 surface ( i.e. [ 110 ] surface ) a large zbcp should be present , while if we probe an @xmath227 surface ( i.e. [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] surfaces ) the zbcp should be absent .",
    "in some well controlled measurements @xcite it has been verified that the zbcp has this orientation dependence ( see ) .",
    "however , because of junction inhomogeneities like faceting @xcite , the local orientation at the junction may not be well defined .",
    "for example the planar junction experiments performed by showed equal weight of the zbcp for all orientations of the electrodes .    studied broadening effects on the zbcp due to impurities introduced into the junction via ion bombardment .",
    "the result suggests that disorder introduces decoherence which removes the mgs resonance .",
    "argue that if the spin - flip mechanism were responsible for the zbcp , the disorder should not have such a large impact , indicating that the mgs are responsible for the zbcp .",
    "shows that the peak height decreases as @xmath87 while the width seems to remain roughly constant , independent of temperature .",
    "this information is obtained by assuming that the peak is positioned on a background in the form of a temperature - dependent gap . in that case , the fwhm is roughly the distance between the two `` fix points '' in .",
    "this behavior implies that the density of mgs ( the area of the peak ) decreases with increasing temperature , which can not be explained by thermal smearing .",
    "the question of temperature - independent width has been addressed by in terms of the effect of rough interfaces and surface umklapp scattering .",
    "bound states induced by impurities have been found experimentally by different groups @xcite . in the most recent experiment by the ldos",
    "was measured by stm in the vicinity of a single impurity ( zn ) replacing a cu atom in the superconducting plane of bscco ( ) .",
    "it was found that the ldos is enhanced at low energy and it has an anisotropic form in real space .",
    "this observation is in qualitatively good agreement with theoretical predictions ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it was predicted that a point - like impurity in a d - wave superconductor is able to form a resonant state within the superconducting gap . if global particle - hole symmetry is present , then in the unitary limit ( strong impurity potential ) , the energy of the resonance approaches the fermi level , and the resonance width tends to zero , the mgs becoming a true bound state .",
    "we can understand this effect by considering a defect with a hard specular boundary the size of which is much larger than the coherence length , as discussed by . in this case , the defect surface can be locally approximated by a planar surface , and our arguments in favor of the presence of the mgs holds .",
    "since different parts of the defect boundary have different orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes and continuously change from @xmath227 to @xmath288 , there are different amounts of trajectories containing local mgs .",
    "consider for example a circular defect , as illustrated in .",
    "then for the ( 110 ) and ( -110 ) directions the local angle is @xmath289 which corresponds to a maximum amount of mgs trajectories , while for ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) orientations , the local angle is @xmath290 which corresponds to a minimum amount of mgs trajectories .",
    "hence , the ldos at low energy @xcite is cross shaped in space with tails along the nodes .",
    "the density of states decreases far from the defect because the mgs are localized near the scatterer over a distance of the order of the coherence length .",
    "in fact , the above arguments rely entirely on quasiclassical dynamics of superconducting quasiparticles , and can therefore be extended ( see [ app_mgs ] ) to defects smaller than the coherence length but larger than the fermi wave length @xcite .",
    "however , in high-@xmath5 materials this difference is not that important since the coherence length is rather small .    at the time of writing ,",
    "an issue under debate is whether the impurity mgs are localized or extended , see e.g. @xcite . in a large crystal",
    "there are many impurities , or inhomogeneities , and hence many mgs , which in principle can form an impurity band similar to impurity bands in semiconductors .",
    "in simplified terms , the mgs wavefunction can leak out along the gap nodes ( the cross - shaped dos described above ) ; if wavefunction overlaps between neighboring impurity states are significant , an impurity band may form . also experimentally , the issue is controversial .",
    "thermal conductivity measurements @xcite on y123 and bscco indicate the existence of extended quasiparticle states , while other investigations @xcite on under - doped y124 indicate the opposite .",
    "in this section we study the ac josephson effect in superconducting junctions .",
    "we begin by outlining the microscopic theory of charge transport in voltage biased josephson junctions .",
    "then we discuss how the mgs resonance appears in this case .",
    "in particular , we show that depending on the lifetime ratio @xmath273 introduced in the previous section , the mgs resonance appears either in the pair current at the gap voltage @xmath291 ( for small intrinsic broadening , @xmath278 ) , or in the single particle current both near zero voltage and at the gap voltage ( for large intrinsic broadening , @xmath277 ) . in the end",
    "we discuss some experiments .",
    "generalization of the previous theory of transport through @xmath292 junctions to @xmath242 junctions [ beyond the tunnel model ; equation  ] is non - trivial due to the josephson effect . in the presence of a bias voltage ,",
    "the phase difference over the josephson junction becomes time - dependent , @xmath293 @xcite , and a quasiparticle incident on the junction will see the junction as a scatterer whose properties periodically change in time with the josephson frequency @xmath294 . in the limit of small applied voltage , @xmath295 , the time - dependent current can be understood via adiabatic arguments , in terms of a time - dependent phase , letting @xmath296 in the equation for the dc josephson current @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "a full quantum mechanical consideration is necessary for inelastic scattering by the time - dependent scatterer , taking into account transitions between the incident quasiparticle energy @xmath297 and an infinite set of sideband energies @xmath298 ( @xmath93 are integers ) .",
    "the time - dependent current can then be decomposed into a spectrum of frequency components @xmath299 where the @xmath300 component is the time averaged current and the @xmath301 components correspond to the ac oscillations with basic frequency @xmath302 .",
    "interestingly , the very early observation by of the ac josephson effect was taken as one of the first proofs for the existence of cooper pairs in the high-@xmath5 superconductors .",
    "within the adiabatic picture for the @xmath1-wave junctions , the @xmath3-periodic current - phase relation in the @xmath143 junction ( see ) will result in an ac josephson oscillation with twice the usual frequency , @xmath303 .",
    "this was predicted by @xcite and using the adiabaticity arguments , and it was recently confirmed by a full calculation of equation   by .",
    "possibly this effect was observed in experiments by , although the authors presented an alternative explanation in terms of parallel junctions in the grain boundary .    the time - independent ( @xmath300 ) current , from now on called the dc current , has contributions from all sidebands , @xmath304 , and at low temperature it has the form @xmath305 remarkably , this expansion for the dc current has two different physical interpretations , which in fact are equivalent , namely multiparticle tunneling ( mpt ) and multiple andreev reflection ( mar ) .",
    "a consistent theory unifying the concepts of mpt and mar has been presented by and .    the first interpretation , multiparticle tunneling ( mpt ) , is particularly useful in the tunnel limit , @xmath306 .",
    "it was originally suggested by using perturbative tunnel model calculations , and it was improved by .",
    "according to this interpretation the @xmath307 current , @xmath308 , is due to single - particle tunneling processes , and it corresponds to the quasiparticle current in a standard tunnel model calculation .",
    "the @xmath309 current , @xmath310 , is due to two - particle tunneling processes which have smaller probability , @xmath311 , and so on . in s - wave junctions ,",
    "energy conservation prohibits the @xmath93-particle tunneling process for @xmath312 .",
    "thus , each @xmath93-particle current has a threshold at voltage @xmath313 and the magnitude of this current is proportional to @xmath314 .",
    "however , resonances due to the presence of surface states or resonances in the barrier may lower the exponent and enhance the intensity of the process @xcite .",
    "the second interpretation , more useful for transparent junctions , is based on the scattering theory and involves multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) @xcite . according to this interpretation",
    ", the current @xmath308 is due to direct scattering ( acceleration ) across the energy gap , see ( a ) , while the current @xmath310 is due to the andreev reflection processes , in the same way as in the ns junction , equation  , depicted in ( b ) . for smaller voltage",
    ", the andreev reflected hole may be andreev reflected once more when reaching the left superconductor , this time as an electron [ see fig .",
    "[ mar_proc](c ) ] , giving the current @xmath315 , and so on .",
    "the multiple andreev reflections form , in principle , an infinite series of currents , equation  .",
    "the magnitude of each current is proportional to @xmath314 ( in the absence of resonances ) , since each process contains @xmath93 coherent passages through the barrier .",
    "the equivalence of these two interpretations @xmath316 mpt and mar @xmath316 is due to the fact that at every andreev reflection one pair of electrons is transmitted through the sn interface , and therefore the mar process with @xmath93 andreev reflections transfers a charge @xmath317 , corresponding to the @xmath318-particle current @xcite .    in @xmath6-wave junctions , the onsets of the @xmath93-particle currents at @xmath319 , together with peaks at the same voltages in the higher order currents due to the dos peaks near the gap edges ,",
    "is the explanation for the so - called subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) , see @xcite and references therein .    in d - wave superconductors ,",
    "the sub - gap structure @xcite is very different for two reasons : ( 1 ) the multiparticle current thresholds are washed out due to the gap nodes , ( 2 ) the presence of mgs changes the resonances in energy space . for the @xmath141 orientation ( no mgs in the junction ) ,",
    "the single - particle current dominates the @xmath320 characteristics because of the gap nodes .",
    "higher order processes ( @xmath321 ) are very small corrections and can be neglected ; thus , sub - harmonic gap structure at @xmath313 is suppressed in the i - v characteristics in @xmath1-wave junctions , see fig .",
    "[ dd_ivtot](a ) .",
    "when mgs are present in the junction , new resonances appear .",
    "in particular , the two - particle process becomes resonant ( see below ) and must be taken into account .",
    "although the mgs may enhance also higher order processes than @xmath309 , these resonances are always very weak compared to the two - particle process . for these reasons we will in the following only discuss the single particle and two particle currents .",
    "we start our discussion of the @xmath320 characteristics of junctions with mgs by presenting in ( b)-(d ) results of full numerical calculations of equation   for junctions where the right electrode has @xmath1-wave symmetry with orientation @xmath322 and the left counter electrode has @xmath6-wave symmetry ( @xmath323 junction ) , @xmath1-wave symmetry with @xmath324 orientation ( @xmath143 junction ) , and @xmath1-wave symmetry with @xmath325 orientation ( @xmath145 junction ) , respectively . in the last junction case we introduced a small imaginary part ( to model broadening ) to the energy in order to reveal the current peak near zero bias .",
    "if the mgs are strongly coupled to the reservoirs ( large intrinsic broadening , @xmath277 ) , the current - voltage characteristics in are dominated by single particle tunneling , and they can be qualitatively understood by applying tunnel model arguments . indeed , when the right superconductor is a @xmath1-wave superconductor with the @xmath326 orientation , the local density of states is given by equation  ; the mgs delta function @xmath327 then produces a term @xcite @xmath328 \\rho_l(\\theta ,-",
    "ev)\\right>.\\ ] ] within this model , we understand figures [ dd_ivtot](b)-(d ) as simply the @xmath6-wave dos , the angle integrated @xmath1-wave dos , and finally the midgap peak .",
    "note that the _ current itself _ rather than the conductance is proportional to the ldos @xmath252 of the left superconductor . for voltages",
    "@xmath329 terms not included in equation   become important and for @xmath330 the current is proportional to the applied voltage .",
    "when the mgs are intrinsically very narrow ( @xmath278 ) , the resonance will not appear in the single - particle current , instead the resonance appears in the two - particle current ( compare the discussion of the @xmath292 junction in ) .",
    "we exemplify this with the @xmath323 and @xmath145 junction cases by plotting the single- and two - particle currents separately along with the total currents in . in the @xmath323 junction case ,",
    "the i - v relations ( total current ) for the @xmath277 and @xmath278 cases are similar , although in the @xmath278 limit the peak at the @xmath6-wave gap voltage is due to the two - particle current ; the resonant process is shown in the inset .",
    "this situation is equivalent to the one in the n / d case discussed in .",
    "however , in the @xmath145 junctions , which have mgs at both sides of the junction barrier , the situation is different .",
    "the process of mgs - to - mgs tunneling is absent in the small @xmath273 limit .",
    "thus there is no current peak at small voltage in this case [ compare ( d ) and ( d ) ] ; instead the resonance shows up in the two - particle current at the gap - voltage @xmath291 , see ( f ) ; the resonant process is shown in the inset .",
    "thus , for this orientation it should be possible experimentally to distinguish the two cases , large or small @xmath273 , by observing where the resonance appears : either near zero voltage ( @xmath277 ) or at the gap voltage ( @xmath278 ) , respectively .",
    "a large number of current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) measurements have been performed with grain boundary and ramp - edge junctions @xcite . in this review",
    "we will not make any serious attempt to analyze these experiments beyond what is stated in the original papers .",
    "instead we will make some comments on a few specific issues .",
    "measurements of ivc of @xmath242 junctions are difficult to analyze .",
    "besides complications with the samples ( see the discussion of measurements of the critical josephson current in section  [ ic_exp ] ) , the presence of the josephson effect makes the sub - gap voltage region hard to interprete .",
    "because of the josephson current , an essential issue concerns how to measure ivc . in order to measure quasi - particle current and conductivity , and to observe the mgs zero - bias peaks , one must work with voltage bias , which by definition avoids the problem with the dc josephson current .",
    "however , this is hard to do experimentally , because of the low junction impedance ; in practice , current bias is therefore usually employed .",
    "alff et al .",
    "@xcite have recently reported ivc measurements on symmetric @xmath176 hts grain boundary junctions with large misorientation angles , in the range @xmath331 .",
    "these junctions show very small or vanishing josephson current , and the conductance @xmath332 vs @xmath256 shows a zero - energy structure quite similar to nis junctions ( see ) , with similar temperature and magnetic field dependences .",
    "alff et al .",
    "@xcite conclude that they in fact observe nis - like behavior , although they interpret the zero - energy structure in the @xmath332 vs @xmath256 characteristic as a zbcp resulting from an sis convolution of density of states with strongly broadened mgs .",
    "the similarity of the zbcps of the nis and sis junctions is striking , and we would like to consider the following tentative explanation . for an sis junction to behave like an nis junction , it is necessary that there are very strong relaxation effects in the barrier region , the barrier acting as a reservoir , which results in decoupling of the two si and is interfaces .",
    "the si / is junctions will then be in series and each will be biased by @xmath333 ; as a result , there will be a zero - bias onset of the current ( without peak ) as in the nis junction , but the maximum gap should occur at @xmath334",
    ". the average gap voltage @xmath335 could be well below this value . whether this agrees with the experimental results remains an open question since there is no independent measurement of the gap in the experiment .",
    "alff et al .",
    "@xcite rather consider their results to signify that the junction is in the _ tunneling _ regime , sis , albeit tunneling is considered to proceed through resonant states in the barrier .",
    "let us then assume that we can describe the junction as a `` tunnel '' junction s``i ' 's , where the `` i''-region can not be regarded a reservoir .",
    "the josephson current could still be suppressed for several reasons : the junction could be long in comparison with the coherence length , or suppressed by inelastic interactions , or there could be fluctuations and noise causing the two sides of the junction to become incoherent . in a symmetric situation with narrow mgs on both sides of the junction , as described before , the mgs dos peaks will then be convoluted , leading to a current peak , i.e. to a peak in the ivc and not in the conductance . in this view , the conductance zero - energy anomaly in the @xmath176 junction describes the _ voltage derivative _ of the mgs dos , and should not be directly compared with the mgs dos of the nis junction .    note that if the mgs is very broad , say @xmath336 , the mgs peak in the calculated ivc will merge into the rising background , and the result",
    "may _ appear similar _ to the nis case ; nevertheless , in our opinion , one should still look for the mgs dos in the ivc , and not in the conductance .",
    "however , with such extreme broadening the mgs may act as normal reservoirs in the gap , and the whole situation may have to be reconsidered .    in conclusion , we believe that further progress depends on close interaction between experiment and theory to critically examine models and results in order to produce internally consistent pictures and new critical experimental tests .",
    "for a long time , the presence of a josephson current in experiments on @xmath74-axis tunnel junctions between ybco and pb has been regarded as rather mysterious , because if the order parameter of ybco has pure @xmath1-wave symmetry , the first order josephson coupling should vanish , only leaving a small residual second order current ( see e.g. references  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion however relies on the assumption that the c - axis current injection , from e.g. an stm tip , results in a spherically symmetric ab - plane injection current . only under such circumstances",
    "is the overlap between the @xmath6-wave and the @xmath1-wave order parameters zero . considering spherical injection ,",
    "the orthorhombic structure of ybco indicates that there may be , in addition to the @xmath1-wave order parameter , a small @xmath6-wave component present which could be responsible for the first order josephson coupling observed in the experiments .",
    "however , twinning spoils this explanation since neighboring twins should have different signs of the @xmath6-wave component , and the average josephson current should be close to zero . studied tunneling along the @xmath74-axis from pb into ybco containing one single twin boundary .",
    "it was shown that indeed a @xmath337 order parameter is realized in ybco and that the sign between the @xmath1-wave and @xmath6-wave components is opposite on the two opposite sides of the twin boundary .",
    "however , also in experiments on junctions between pb and highly twinned ybco @xcite , a first order josephson coupling was found .",
    "furthermore , in experiments on @xmath74-axis bscco - pb junctions @xcite a finite first - order josephson coupling was observed and interpreted in terms of a small @xmath6-wave component also in bscco .",
    "recently an interesting possibility was brought forward by , who pointed out that pb is a rather anisotropic @xmath6-wave superconductor and showed how this asymmetry on the @xmath6-wave superconductor side can explain at least the experiments on bscco .",
    "to test this idea , a thorough investigation of the josephson coupling between isotropic @xmath6-wave superconductors and bscco should be performed .",
    "very recently , found the half - flux quantum also in tricrystal rings of the electron - doped cuprates ncco and pcco .",
    "this provides very strong evidence for @xmath1-wave superconductivity in both these materials .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the power - law dependence of the penetration depth found by . however , in transport experiments @xcite zbcps were never found . instead ,",
    "more or less v - shaped spectra were obtained .",
    "this absence of zbpc was taken as evidence for an anisotropic @xmath6-wave order parameter in ncco , but now turns out to be in disagreement with the very recent tricrystal ring experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , at this point , a reexamination of the transport properties of the electron - doped materials seems necessary in order to check the presence of mgs also in these materials .",
    "we would like to point out that the experimental results obtained by alff can be understood within the mgs scenario if the mgs in these materials are intrinsically very narrow [ small @xmath273 , equation  ] .",
    "however , also in the normal - metal - superconductor ( n / d ) experiments on ncco by the zbcp was absent , which can not be explained by a narrow mgs only .",
    "midgap states ( mgs ) are consequences of the angle - dependent sign change of the order parameter and provide direct evidence for @xmath1-wave symmetry . transport measurements which detect the mgs resonance at the fermi energy for particular orientations of the plane of the junction with respect to the crystallographic axes will provide crucial evidence for @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "the mgs phenomenon is part of a general problem of superconducting surface and interface states and their relation to the andreev states , which determine the transport properties of superconducting junctions .",
    "surface midgap states ( mgs ) in d - wave superconductors are robust features which result in a large number of observable effects : large josephson current , low - temperature anomaly of the critical current , @xmath3-junction behavior , @xmath338 junction crossover with temperature , zero - bias conductance peaks , paramagnetic currents , time reversal symmetry breaking and spontaneous interface currents , and resonance features in subgap currents .    some of these consequences of mgs have been verified experimentally ( zero - bias conductance peaks , paramagnetic currents and impurity - induced states ) , while some remain controversial ( time - reversal symmetry breaking and spontaneous surface / interface currents ) , or so far unobserved ( large josephson current and the @xmath87 low - temperature anomaly of the critical current in low - transparency junctions ) .",
    "a number of problems need to be clarified , e.g. the character and strength of relaxation processes and the width of the mgs .",
    "in particular , does absence of mgs imply absence of @xmath1-wave ( and presence of @xmath6-wave ) , or does it imply @xmath1-wave and strong decoherence ?    the predicted low - temperature anomaly associated with mgs , @xmath339 , remains to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "the lack of experimental evidence may be due to faceting of the grain - boundary @xcite : different parts of the junction may have local orientations supporting large mgs currents , but with opposite signs for different facets .",
    "consequently , the low - temperature anomaly associated with the mgs may be averaged out for a macroscopic junction .",
    "the obvious remedy is to work with junctions with interfaces with well - defined orientation .",
    "the true nature of hts grain - boundary ( gb ) and step - edge josephson junctions remains , in our opinion , a mystery .",
    "it is difficult to get a consistent picture . in recent work on low - impedance step - edge junctions , a reasonable description of the josephson current",
    "could be obtained assuming high transparency , while at the same time the low junction resistivity suggested that the transport is through high - transparency spots , point contacts or pinholes , in the interface barrier . in gb junctions at moderate misorientation angles a similar description may be appropriate . at large misorientation angles ,",
    "however , the gb junctions has been characterized as an sis tunneling junction with resonant states in the barrier . however , it is difficult to judge whether the experimental results imply coherent tunneling or incoherent transport through the junction . here",
    "coevolution of experiment and theory seems to be necessary to obtain deeper understanding .",
    "other predictions which need to be verified experimentally include negative differential conductance in sub - gap structure ( needs a voltage - bias setup ) , and spontaneous magnetization in time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) states at @xmath143 junctions .    in a number of interesting recent experiments",

    ", we first solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for bulk @xmath6-wave and @xmath1-wave superconductors and then we discuss the clean ns interface and the concept of andreev reflection . the andreev reflection phase shift used throughout the review",
    "is then obtained .",
    "finally we show how the mgs are formed as a consequence of the sign difference between the lobes of the @xmath1-wave gap and why the formation of mgs is not sensitive to the detailed spatial dependence of the gap , although the mgs wavefunction itself depends on this shape .",
    "some particularly useful references regarding the technique used to obtain the solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for different structures can be found in @xcite . for the @xmath6-wave ns junctions we refer to and for the @xmath1-wave case we refer to .",
    "derived the andreev states present in @xmath6-wave sis structures .",
    "the bdg equations for @xmath6-wave superconductors are @xmath344 where @xmath345 and @xmath346 are the electron and hole components of the wavefunction , @xmath347 in the simplest case , and @xmath297 is measured relative to the chemical potential @xmath348 .",
    "is easily solved for a bulk superconductor with @xmath349 by making the following ansatz : @xmath350 where @xmath345 and @xmath346 do not depend on @xmath351 .",
    "the secular equation restricts the modulus of the @xmath352-vectors , @xmath353 , to @xmath354 where @xmath355 . in the last step we assumed that the quasiparticle energy is much smaller than the fermi energy .",
    "there will then be two types of wave functions , electron - like and hole - like , depending of what type of solutions they describe in the normal limit ( @xmath356 ) .",
    "labeling these by @xmath357 and @xmath358 respectively , where @xmath359 ( @xmath360 ) , we have @xmath361 where @xmath362 and @xmath363 are given by @xmath364 together with the normalization condition @xmath365 . above we assumed that @xmath366 since there can not be any propagating solutions for energies below the gap .",
    "however , there are also exponentially decaying or growing solutions which become important for surfaces . by defining @xmath367 for @xmath9 ,",
    "the above expressions describe the exponentially decaying ( in the direction of propagation ) solutions for subgap energies .    for the normal metal",

    "electrons are reflected as holes and vice versa . in this section",
    "we will discuss this basic process more quantitatively by solving the bdg equation for the normal metal/@xmath6-wave superconductor interface .",
    "putting the n / s interface at @xmath388 and assuming that the gap depends on the space coordinate as @xmath389 we are left with the simple problem of matching elementary plane wave solutions of the bdg equation in each region at the surface .",
    "the plane wave solutions of the bdg equation are derived above in this appendix .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , propagation along the @xmath186-axis only , we write down an ansatz wavefunction describing an electron incident on the superconductor from the normal metal side @xmath390 where we have taken into account that the electron may be reflected as an electron as well as a hole . on the superconductor side",
    "we include transmitted electron - like and hole - like quasiparticles @xmath391 at the interface ( at @xmath388 ) the wave function continuity gives @xmath392 during this process of andreev reflection , the electron incident from the normal metal is reflected as a hole with the probability amplitude @xmath393 .",
    "the probability for andreev reflection is @xmath394 for energies within the gap while quickly decreasing outside the gap .",
    "it is then convenient to write the amplitude of andreev reflection for @xmath9 on the form @xmath395 which defines the andreev reflection phase shift @xmath128 used in the text .",
    "note that also the phase @xmath14 of @xmath0 is picked up during andreev reflection .",
    "charge conservation during andreev reflection is preserved by letting a cooper pair enter the superconductor .",
    "consequently , a charge @xmath396 is transferred from the normal metal to the superconductor , which explains how subgap current may appear . in the same way , a hole incident on the superconductor from the normal metal side may be andreev reflected as an electron transferring a charge @xmath396 from the superconductor to the normal metal .",
