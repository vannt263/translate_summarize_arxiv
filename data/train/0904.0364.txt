    "masslessness often arises as a consequence of the existence of a symmetry . in quantum electrodynamics",
    "the masslessness of the photon is normally attributed to gauge invariance , or symmetry under local changes of phase . in quantum chromodynamics ,",
    "the theory of the strong interaction , masslessness of the gluons is likewise attributed to a gauge invariance , albeit a nonlinear one . in general relativity",
    ", the masslessness of gravitons can be traced to symmetry under active diffeomorphisms : no diffeomorphism - invariant mass term exists .",
    "in some circumstances , however , there exists an alternative reason why a field might be massless .",
    "surprisingly , this alternative explanation involves the breaking of a symmetry rather than its existence . a general result , the nambu - goldstone theorem  @xcite , states under mild assumptions that there must be a massless particle whenever a continuous global symmetry of an action is nt a symmetry of the vacuum .    in this talk , based on ongoing work with alan kosteleck  @xcite ,",
    "we show that an alternative description of gravity can be constructed from a symmetric two - tensor without the assumption of masslessness . in this picture , masslessness is a consequence of symmetry breaking rather than of exact symmetry : diffeomorphism symmetry and local lorentz symmetry are spontaneously broken , but the graviton remains massless because it is a nambu - goldstone mode .",
    "the cardinal object in the theory is a symmetric two - tensor - density , denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "starting point is the lagrange density @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the usual quadratic kinetic operator for a massless spin-2 field , @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath4 is a potential which is built out of the four scalars @xmath5 we will suppose that @xmath4 has a local minimum at @xmath6 , and that @xmath0 acquires an expectation value @xmath7 .",
    "note that this implies spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance .",
    "we can now decompose @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the fluctuations of @xmath0 .    at low energy , the values of the scalars @xmath10",
    "will be approximately fixed to their values @xmath11 in the local minimum .",
    "then , the linearized form of the potential can be taken equivalent to a sum of lagrange multiplier terms that fix the values of the four scalars @xmath10 to the values @xmath11 : @xmath12 we obtain the linearized equations of motion @xmath13 together with the constraints @xmath14 noting that the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lin_eom ] ) equals the linear part of the ricci tensor , it follows that the low - energy linearized dynamics of this model is equivalent to linearized general relativity in an axial - type gauge defined by conditions ( [ gauge_conditions ] ) .",
    "the four gauge conditions ( [ gauge_conditions ] ) reduce the original 10 @xmath15 modes to 6 degrees of freedom . they can be expressed",
    "as the generators of the lorentz generators @xmath16 acting on the vacuum expectation value @xmath17 of the cardinal field : @xmath18 imposing the equations of motion imposes masslessness as well as the lorenz conditions : @xmath19 reducing the number of propagating degrees of freedom to two helicities .",
    "in order that the cardinal model correctly describe gravity it needs to be coupled to the matter energy - momentum tensor . at the linear level , this can be done by including the term @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the trace - reversed energy - momentum tensor . as a result",
    ", the equations of motion reduce to the linearized einstein equation @xmath22 ( where we have taken , for now , the values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath23 equal to zero ) .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor consists not only of contributions of matter .",
    "there is a contribution of the gravitons themselves as well , quadratic in @xmath9 . as a consequence",
    ", the inclusion of a cubic term in ( [ cardinal_flat ] ) is required .",
    "this , in turn , implies a cubic contribution to the energy - momentum tensor , corresponding to a quartic term in the lagrangian .",
    "this process continues indefinitely , yielding in the limit the full einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by deser  @xcite that this `` bootstrap '' process can be carried out , for general relativity , in one step if one rewrites the free graviton action in first order ( palatini ) form .    in order to implement this bootstrap procedure for the cardinal theory ,",
    "we pass , as a first step , to the trace - reversed tensor @xmath24 as @xmath25 the kinetic term in ( [ cardinal_flat ] ) can be rewritten in palatini form as @xmath26 where the connection coefficients @xmath27 are to be considered as independent additional variables .",
    "it can be shown that the bootstrap of the kinetic term then terminates after one step , yielding @xmath28 which is equivalent to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath29 from the latter form we conclude that @xmath30 is naturally interpreted as a curved - space metric density .    the bootstrap procedure can also be applied to the matter interaction to determine the form of the matter coupling for cardinal gravity . for this purpose ,",
    "the interaction ( [ lin_matter ] ) is conveniently expressed in terms of the trace - reversed energy - momentum tensor @xmath31 for the matter .",
    "this tensor arises by variation of the lagrange density @xmath32 for the matter fields via @xmath33 in the usual way .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath34 for the matter interaction with the cardinal field @xmath35 . applying the bootstrap procedure",
    "can be shown to generate the lagrange density @xmath36 this expression corresponds to the usual curved - space matter lagrangian if we identify ( as above ) @xmath30 as the metric density .",
    "for example , the bootstrap procedure applied to the flat - space electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor yields @xmath37    it is interesting to note at this point that the way we implemented the bootstrap procedure above is not completely unique . instead of writing the full trace - reversed tensor @xmath35 in the palatini form ( [ palatini ] )",
    ", one could substitute its fluctuations @xmath38 ( defined analogously to @xmath9 above ) instead . while this makes no difference in the linearized expression ,",
    "when applying the bootstrap to this form one ends up with a different result , yielding @xmath39 as the curved - space metric density . applying this alternative procedure to the matter coupling yields a curved - space matter lagrangian with an explicit reference to the expectation value @xmath17 , constituting lorentz - violating terms that can be related to the standard model extension  @xcite .",
    "its parameters for lorentz violation have been subject to numerous experimental measurements  @xcite . for details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most interesting application of the bootstrap is to the scalar potential v , which we now express as a function of four scalars @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) defined analogously to the @xmath42 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ x1])([x4 ] ) but with @xmath0 replaced by the trace - reversed tensor @xmath35 . as it turns out , for the procedure to be able to be applied to @xmath4 , the latter needs to satisfy nontrivial integrability conditions that strongly restrict its functional form .",
    "for instance , it follows that the unique lowest - order ( in terms of the total power of @xmath24 ) integrable polynomials are @xmath43 more generally , it follows that any polynomial obtained as the term at order @xmath44 in the series expansion of @xmath45|}$ ] is a solution @xmath46 . applying the bootstrap to @xmath46 yields @xmath47|}-\\sum_{k=0}^{q-1}\\fv_k.\\ ] ] we postulate that any integrable potential can be obtained as a suitable linear combination of the @xmath46 polynomials .    of particular interest",
    "are scalar potentials @xmath48 that have a taylor expansion of the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 real constants .",
    "if we impose that @xmath50 be positive definite , @xmath48 has a local minimum at @xmath51 ( @xmath41 ) , and it can represent a possibly stable vacuum . it can be shown that the integrability conditions impose constraints on the @xmath50 and on the higher order coefficients , but that a nontrivial solution space exists  @xcite .",
    "we have verified numerically that there is a non - empty subset of positive definite solutions , confirming the possibility of scalar potential with stable vacua  @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that , in the limit @xmath52 the integrable potentials @xmath48 of eq .  [ potential - taylor ] correspond to integrable potentials in the linearized limit considered above @xmath53 fixing the value of @xmath40 to be @xmath54 .",
    "we conclude that in this limit , the bootstrapped cardinal model corresponds to general relativity in the gauge defined by the constraints @xmath51 .",
    "this is also the case for a potential with finite @xmath50 , if we only consider energy scales low enough such that any fluctuations away from the minimum in the potential can be neglected .",
    "after applying the bootstrap procedure described above we end up with a lagrangian density of the form @xmath55 the linearized equations of motion become : @xmath56 where we defined @xmath57    we see from eq .",
    "( [ full_lin_eqs ] ) that the first term on the right - hand side naturally takes the form of a ( trace - reversed ) energy momentum tensor .",
    "explicitly , we can identify a `` vacuum energy - momentum tensor '' @xmath58 with @xmath59 it takes nonzero values whenever the scalar potential takes values away from the minimum .",
    "explicit solutions of the linearized equations of motion can be obtained with nonzero vacuum energy - momentum tensor . in the latter case",
    ", independent initial / boundary field values can be defined on maximally 4 suitably defined timelike / spacelike spacetime slices .",
    "if the matter energy - momentum tensor is known to be independently conserved ( e.g. , by symmetry arguments ) , the same has to be true for the vacuum energy - momentum tensor . in such a case , choosing @xmath60 to be zero at the initial value spacetime slices ensures it is zero throughout spacetime",
    "we showed it is possible to construct an alternative theory of gravity , the cardinal model , based on spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry .",
    "the massless gravitons can be interpreted as nambu - goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken lorentz symmetry .",
    "the full nonlinear form of the lagrangian is fixed by consistent coupling of gravity to the total energy - momentum tensor , and can be constructed by a bootstrap process , starting with an initial lagrangian for the cardinal field consisting of a quadratic kinetic term and a scalar potential . as it turns out , consistency of the bootstrap process imposes strong restrictions on the form of the scalar potential .",
    "nevertheless , consistent potentials exist with local minima . at low energy ,",
    "the lagrangian corresponds to the einstein - hilbert action , with the possible presence of a nonzero `` vacuum energy - momentum tensor '' . at high energy ,",
    "four extra massive graviton modes appear that modify the dynamics of the theory .",
    "an open problem remains the classification of all possible bootstrapped potentials and a study of their properties .",
    "other issues that merit further study are the effect of the massive modes , in particular near singularities or at high temperatures , as well as a study of the quantization of the cardinal model .",
