    "in the last few years , it has become clear that globular cluster ( gc ) systems have complex colour distributions , indicating two or more subpopulations within a single elliptical galaxy ( ashman & zepf 1992 ; secker 1995 ; whitmore 1995 ; geisler 1996 ; forbes , brodie & huchra 1997 ; bridges 1997 ; kissler - patig & gebhardt 1998 ; kundu & whitmore 2001 ; larsen 2001 ) .",
    "the subpopulations have different metallicities and possibly ages , indicating multiple epochs or mechanisms of formation .",
    "as gcs are thought to trace the star formation and chemical enrichment episodes of their host galaxy ( e.g. forbes & forte 2001 ) , understanding how they formed will provide important constraints on the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the main scenarios for gc formation include : + * @xmath2 * the merger of two gas  rich ( spiral ) galaxies may lead to the formation of an elliptical galaxy and create an additional population of gcs in the process ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) . since the gcs produced in the merger formed from enriched gas they should be of higher metallicity and thus redder than the indigenous ( metal - poor ) gc population .",
    "thus we expect a metal - poor old population ( @xmath113 gyrs ) plus a metal - rich young population with an age similar to that of the merger itself . + * @xmath2 * a multi  phase collapse ( forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) can also produce two distinct gc populations . here the blue gcs formed in an early chaotic phase of galaxy formation from metal - poor gas and the red gcs later from enriched gas in the same phase that produces the bulk of the galaxy starlight .",
    "a multi  phase collapse also predicts an old metal - poor subpopulation and one a slightly younger ( @xmath3 age @xmath124 gyr ) metal - rich one . + * @xmath2 * cot , marzke & west ( 1998 ) describe the build - up of the gc systems of bright ellipticals via the accretion of mostly metal - poor gcs from dwarf galaxies . in this picture",
    "the metal - rich gcs are indigenous and the metal - poor ones are acquired .",
    "here both the gc subpopulations will be about the same age ( i.e. old ) but with different metallicities .",
    "+ * @xmath2 * formation of gc systems in hierarchical merging is described in beasley ( 2002 ) . in this prescription blue gcs form in pre - galactic clumps .",
    "these gaseous clumps merge generating a second generation of red gcs , along with galactic star formation .",
    "late stage mergers of more stellar clumps may include accreted gcs .",
    "thus the hierarchical picture contains elements of the other three . in a hierarchical universe , the metal - poor gcs will be old with the metal - rich gcs having a mean age that depends on galaxy mass and environment . +",
    "perhaps the best direct test of these competing gc formation models is to determine the mean age and metallicity of the gc subpopulations for a large number of galaxies . in principle , the best way to do this is from gc spectra .",
    "indeed this is an active area of research using the world largest telescopes , and is returning exciting new results ( e.g. kissler - patig 1998 ; forbes 2001 ; larsen 2002 ; beasley 2003 ) .",
    "however it is also very time consuming .",
    "photometry is more efficient , but optical colours suffer from the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "this situation can be improved by extending photometry to the near - infrared ( e.g. puzia 2002 ) or ultra - violet .",
    "photometry in the u ( 3600 ) band is very rare for gc systems beyond the local group ( the @xmath170 gcs in ngc  5128 with u - band photometry from rejkuba 2001 is one exception ) .",
    "this is largely due to the poor blue response of most ccds in use today and the low fraction of u - band light emitted by old stellar populations such as gcs .",
    "here we present ubri photometry of gcs associated with the leo group galaxy ngc  3379 , obtained with the blue sensitive ccds of the isaac newton telescope 2.5  m wide field camera . by extending the traditional optical photometry to bluer u - band wavelengths , we can better probe the metallicity distribution of the gc system in ngc  3379 .",
    "we also utilise some smaller field - of - view images taken with the gemini north 8 m telescope to aid in the selection of gc candidates .",
    "ngc  3379 ( m105 ) is a moderate luminosity e1 galaxy in the nearby ( d = 11.5 mpc , m ",
    "m = 30.30 ) leo group . in a photographic study of ngc  3379 ,",
    "harris & van den bergh ( 1981 ) estimated a total gc population of 290 @xmath4 150 .",
    "this translates into a low specific frequency s@xmath5 of 1.1 @xmath4 0.6 ( assuming m@xmath6 = 21.06 ) .",
    "ajhar ( 1994 ) obtained vri ccd images of ngc  3379 detecting some 60 gcs .",
    "however , they did not detect any obvious bimodality in the gc colour distribution .",
    "the first clear detection of bimodality came from the hst study by larsen ( 2001 ) .",
    "they found peaks at ( v  i)@xmath0 = 0.96 and 1.17 for the blue and red subpopulations respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath7 .",
    "broadband ubri images covering the leo galaxies ngc 3379 , ngc 3384 and ngc 3389 were obtained using the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( int ) on 2000 february 6th and 8th .",
    "the wide field camera ( wfc ) comprises 4 thinned eev 4096x2048 ccds , with pixels of 0.33@xmath8 and provides a field - of - view of approximately 30 @xmath9 30 arcmin .",
    "observing conditions were photometric over the two nights with seeing of 1.5@xmath8 in u and i bands and 2.2@xmath8 in b and r bands .",
    "the total exposure times were roughly 2000  s ( u ) , 3000  s ( b ) , 1500  s ( r ) and 1000  s ( i ) .",
    "in addition to the galaxy observations , several standard star fields from landolt ( 1992 ) were obtained over both nights which bracket the galaxy observations .",
    "basic data reduction was performed using iraf and specially written software by a. terlevich .",
    "this consisted of master bias subtraction , non - linear correction , flat - fielding using combined sky flats , alignment and co - addition of individual frames .",
    "the galaxy frames and standard stars were reduced in an identical manner .",
    "raw magnitudes of between 10 and 30 stars were obtained for each filter using the iraf task qphot , after determining the optimal aperture size .",
    "the zero point for each filter was determined by a simple linear fit to the stellar raw magnitudes versus stellar colour and a correction for airmass .",
    "the airmass extinction coefficients of k@xmath10 = 0.46 , k@xmath11 = 0.22 , k@xmath12 = 0.08 and k@xmath13 = 0.04 mag / airmass have been taken from the int wfc web page .",
    "the final airmass corrected , one second zero points are z@xmath10 = 22.98 @xmath4 0.01 , z@xmath11 = 24.84 @xmath4 0.02 , z@xmath12 = 24.65 @xmath4 0.02 and z@xmath13 = 23.96 @xmath4 0.01 .",
    "the bri zero points compare well with those determined by mills et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from the same observing run and the zero points listed on the int / wfc web page .",
    "an independent estimate of the u band zero point ( z@xmath10 = 22.98 @xmath4 0.05 ) was made by f. reda ( 2002 , priv .",
    "comm . ) by comparing various aperture magnitudes for ngc 3379 to that listed in hypercat ( http://www-obs.univ-lyon1.fr/hypercat/ ) .",
    "finally , we adjusted these zero points for galactic extinction using values from the nasa extragalactic database ( http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu ) , i.e. a@xmath10 = 0.132 , a@xmath11 = 0.105 , a@xmath12 = 0.065 , a@xmath13 = 0.047 .",
    "in order to better reveal the inner gcs , we subtracted a model of ngc  3379 .",
    "galaxy subtraction was performed using the stsdas isophote package ( see forbes & thomson 1992 ) . a galaxy model , with a varying centre , ellipticity and position angle , was fit in all four filters .",
    "isophotes were modelled out to @xmath1350@xmath8 ( 20 kpc ) .",
    "a 3 sigma - clip criterion over 5 iterations was used to remove deviant pixels ( e.g. bright objects ) from the fit .",
    "the model - subtracted images were visually inspected and iterated if necessary to provide a smooth transition from the background level to the model - subtracted region .",
    "the resulting residual images made it easier to identify the inner gcs .",
    "the four filter ( i.e. ubri ) images of the leo galaxy triplet were aligned to within a fraction of a pixel and trimmed using the imalign task .",
    "we then used daofind to select gc candidates in each filter independently .",
    "selection criteria consisted of a s / n threshold of 6 and psf fwhm adjusted to the seeing conditions in each filter . additionally , roundness criteria ranging between values of -1.0 and 1.0 , and a sharpness range of 0 to 1.0 provided good exclusion of extended objects .",
    "the resulting database of gc candidates consisted of over 3,000 objects for each filter .",
    "the phot task was used to measure the magnitude and error of each object in all four bands as found by daofind .",
    "a simple script was written to perform the first stage of filtering and reduce the number of candidates to only those detected in all four bands .",
    "this spatial coordinate matching reduced the dataset to 1,200 objects with measured ubri magnitudes .",
    "the same script determined galactocentric coordinates for each object based on the galaxy centre taken from the galaxy model ( with the centre position constant within a fraction of a pixel ) .",
    "the reduced candidate list was then visually inspected to eliminate the small number of remaining galaxy - like extended objects or ccd artifacts .",
    "to aid in the selection and interpretation of leo group gcs , we use observations of milky way and m31 gcs ( essentially the only two galaxies that have well - studied gc systems in the u - band ) .",
    "data for the milky way gc system comes from the compilation of harris ( 1996 ) . from this list de - reddened u , b , and i - band photometry exists for 95 gcs .",

    "this is the first time the ( u  b)@xmath0 vs ( b  i)@xmath0 colour distribution for the gcs of these galaxies have been examined together .",
    "the data define a relatively tight distribution in this plot covering a range of @xmath11.5 mags in each colour , with the m31 gcs extending to slightly redder colours . in general , the distributions for the two galaxies are qualitatively similar .",
    "however we do note that the slope of the milky way distribution ( u  b)@xmath0 = 0.725@xmath9(b  i)@xmath01.047 ( rms = 0.088 ) , is somewhat flatter than that for m31 ( u ",
    "b)@xmath0 = 1.202@xmath9(b  i)@xmath01.850 ( rms = 0.122 ) .",
    "this may represent intrinsic differences in the gc systems of the two galaxies , but is more likely to be due to the uncertain reddening corrections that have been applied .",
    "both galaxies reveal a dominant grouping of blue gcs , with a less well - defined tail to redder colours .",
    "we associate the former with the metal - poor gc subpopulation and the latter with the metal - rich gc subpopulation in these galaxies .",
    "the location of these subpopulations in colour space will be discussed in more detail below . noting the general similarities of the two distributions , we have combined the milky way and m31 gc samples to define a mean gc colour - colour distribution .",

    "a least squares fit to the combined sample is also shown .",
    "the best fit line is of the form ( u  b)@xmath0 = 0.94 @xmath9 ( b  i)@xmath0 - 1.39 , with an rms spread about the best fit of @xmath1 0.12 mag .",
    "we use this colour - colour relation and spread to help us define the colours expected for gcs in ngc  3379 .",
    "images of the central regions of ngc  3379 have been taken with the gmos instrument on the gemini north telescope in 2003 february .",

    "next we restricted the object list in b magnitude .",
    "an upper limit of b = 19 was chosen to exclude bright stars and/or compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "this limit is 4@xmath17 brighter than the expected gc turnover magnitude for ngc  3379 , and corresponds to m@xmath11 = 11.3 .",
    "we also imposed a lower magnitude cutoff of b = 23 , to avoid any colour bias in the sample .",
    "these selection criteria are also shown in fig .",

    "the ( b  i)@xmath0 range was chosen to be similar to that of the milky way and m31 , i.e. covering the full metallicity range expected of gcs but allowing for an additional 0.25 mag in a@xmath6 reddening .",
    "the range in ( u  b)@xmath0 corresponds to the scatter seen in the combined milky way and m31 datasets of 0.12 mag , added in quadrature with our typical ( u  b)@xmath0 photometric error .",
    "most of the data lie in the defined region , indicating that the contamination in the gemini data is indeed low .",

    "a second , red subpopulation is difficult to clearly identify .    if we examine only the ( b  i)@xmath0 colours of the objects within the colour selected region , we then obtain the histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ geminihist ] .",

    "in order to extend our study beyond the central few arcminutes of ngc  3379 ( i.e. that covered by the gemini imaging ) , we now return to the int imaging .",
    "we restrict candidate gcs to lie within 5.5@xmath14 ( 18 kpc ) in galactocentric radius , as beyond this radius we no longer witness a decline in the surface density of detected objects ( see fig .  [ radial ] ) .",
    "thus the majority of objects interior to this radius appear to be associated with ngc  3379 .",
    "this radial selection also ensures there are very few , if any gcs associated with ngc  3384 ( projected separation of 7.2@xmath14 ) in our final object list .",
    "we then applied the same b magnitude selection ( i.e. 19 @xmath18 b@xmath0 @xmath18 23 ) as above .",

    "we find 133 candidate gcs within the colour selected region .",
    "the measured magnitudes and positions of these objects are listed in appendix a. how does this final number compare with the total number of gcs estimated by harris & van den bergh ( 1981 ) of 290 @xmath4 150 ?",
    "our data have complete radial coverage ( with the possibility of missing a few gcs in the very inner regions ) but clearly under - sample the gc luminosity function .",
    "we reach magnitudes similar to , or slightly brighter than , the expected turnover magnitude .",
    "thus crudely we expect a factor of 22.5@xmath9 more gcs than we detected , i.e. 266333 .",
    "examination of the colour selected region however suggests that it contains a number of background objects , i.e. objects with a wide range of ( b  i)@xmath0 colours and a mean ( u  b)@xmath0 colour of about 0.5 .",
    "these were not generally seen in the gemini - selected data , and are presumably not gcs but background galaxies .",
    "so the total number of gcs in ngc  3379 may be closer to 250 than 300 .",
    "both values are consistent with the low gc specific frequency found by harris & van den bergh ( 1981 ) .    in order to further investigate this issue",
    "we have defined a background region of the same central area as studied above but located at a galactocentric radius of more than 13.3@xmath14 ( 44 kpc ) .",
    "the background objects , after b magnitude selection , are shown in fig .  [ back ] .",

    "however , the origin of the large differences between the u  b colours of the worthey models , and those of brocato and maraston , seem to lie in a combination of the theoretical isochrones adopted ( those from vandenberg 1985 ; green 1987 in the case of the worthey models ) and the conversion between luminosity / temperature to magnitude / colour in the observational plane .",

    "the ages of the gc subpopulations in ngc  3379 are less well constrained by our data .",
    "however , similarities between ngc  3379 and the milky way and m31 gc colours suggests that the blue subpopulation in all three galaxies has a similar , old age . from the colour - magnitude diagram of fig .",
    "[ cmd ] , the red subpopulation in ngc  3379 is fainter in the mean than the blue gcs .",
    "this effectively rules out a young ( i.e. @xmath18 3 gyr ) age .",
    "magnitudes and colours , from the isaac newton telescope , for 133 candidate globular clusters around ngc  3379 are presented .",
    "our detection rate is consistent with a low specific frequency .",
    "these candidates , and a subsample selected from imaging with the gemini north telescope , reveal evidence for a blue and red subpopulation .",
    "we have compared the ( u  b)@xmath0 vs ( b  i)@xmath0 colours of the ngc  3379 globular cluster system with that for the milky way and m31 .",
    "the milky way and m31 reveal similar gc colour distributions , although with slightly different slopes ( which may simply be the result of uncertain reddening corrections ) .",
    "the metal - poor and metal - rich subpopulations can be seen as a dominant blue and a less well - defined red peak . using the single stellar population models of maraston ( 2003 , priv .",
    "comm . ) and brocato ( 2000 ) , we find that the mean colours of both subpopulations are best reproduced by their 15 gyr old tracks .",
    "even so , small colour differences between the model and the measurements exist . as the mean age of the milky way globular clusters",
    "is thought to be closer to 12 gyrs , it suggests that these model require a relative age adjustment .",
    "the estimated mean metallicities of the two subpopulations are very similar to those measured previously from spectroscopy .",
    "we also investigated the models of worthey ( 1994 ) , and found they were unable to reproduce the ( u  b)@xmath0 colour of the metal - rich subpopulation in m31 and the milky way for any age .",
    "for ngc  3379 we detect a blue subpopulation with very similar ( u  b)@xmath0 and ( b  i)@xmath0 colours , and presumably age / metallicity , to that of the milky way and m31 globular cluster systems .",
    "thus the blue gcs in ngc  3379 are consistent with being very old and with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.5 .",
    "the red subpopulation is less well - defined , perhaps due to increased photometric errors , but has a similar mean ( b  i)@xmath0 colour to the milky way and m31 globular cluster systems .",
    "this implies a mean photometric metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.6 .",
