    "we firstly discuss on the case with @xmath39 , the case with @xmath40 corresponds to the resonant interaction between solitons and it will be discussed in the sec .",
    "iii ( b ) part .",
    "it is seen that there are both location and peak oscillations for solitons with strong overlapping .",
    "the oscillation behavior become weak with weak overlapping .",
    "the overlapping part of solitons become less and less with increasing the distance of soliton and keeping the other parameters determining the profile of each soliton unchanged . combining the dynamics results in fig .",
    "2 , we can see that breathing behavior become weaker with less overlapping part .",
    "this suggests that the overlapping part plays essential role in the breathing behavior of the two solitons .",
    "two solitons with zero initial relative velocity and small separations can form a bound state which breath with time evolution periodically ( see fig .",
    "similar breathing bound states formed by solitons have been shown widely @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the two solitons are initially located with larger distance , the location oscillation will become less obvious , and the soliton s peak value will demonstrate oscillation ( see fig . 2 ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "this suggests that there are particles exchange between the two bright solitons .",
    "if we further increase the distance between solitons , the breathing behavior including both location and peak breathing dynamics will become invisible , as shown in fig .",
    "nextly , we will try to understand the breathing behavior between solitons from a physical mechanism .",
    "the breathing peak of solitons suggest there are atoms exchange between solitons .",
    "this makes us think about the tunneling dynamics of matter wave in a double well potential in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nonlinear term @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be seen as a potential @xmath42 in quantum dynamics @xcite . in quantum dynamics",
    ", the wave function will denote the spatial probability distribution function of one - particle .",
    "the norm of wave function will denote probability distribution .",
    "this naturally corresponds to the density distribution for large number of identical particles occupying on the same quantum state . for the bec system , this is reasonably the density distribution of atoms .",
    "the oscillation behavior has two parts : peak oscillation and location oscillation .",
    "firstly , we investigate the peak oscillation ( as the case shown in fig .",
    "2 ( c ) ) , for which solitons show obvious breathing peak and the locations are nearly fixed .",
    "the corresponding potential well of the initial solitons in fig .",
    "2(c ) is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the two bright solitons induce an effective double - well structure potential .",
    "then , it is natural to expect that there should be some periodic tunneling behavior between the two wells , based on quantum tunneling theory @xcite .",
    "2(c ) indeed shows that the left soliton demonstrates a tunneling behavior to the other .",
    "the occupying probability in each well for a single - particle will corresponds to the particles number in each well for atoms in bec .",
    "based on the tunneling mechanism , we can know that the tunneling behavior becomes weaker and weaker with overlapping of solitons is less and less .",
    "this comes from that the less overlapping of solitons makes the effective barrier between two double well be higher and wider ( see fig .",
    "1(d ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) ) , which restrains tunneling behavior .",
    "this can be used to explain that the tunneling behavior of the ones in fig .",
    "2(d ) is almost invisible .",
    "when the overlapping part is large , the corresponding effective barrier between two wells will become lower and narrower ( fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this brings the tunneling behavior become more drastic ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "therefore , the breathing behavior of two parallel solitons comes from the tunneling mechanism .",
    "two bright solitons with zero relative velocity can interact with each other and form a breathing bound state @xcite .",
    "the breathing behavior is similar to the k - m breather @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism for this breathing behavior should be different from the k - m breather @xcite , since they exist on different backgrounds .",
    "k - m breather comes form the modulational instability , which mainly involves the perturbation signal interact with a plane wave background .",
    "the breathing bound state here is formed by two bright soliton on a zero background .",
    "one can prove that the bright soliton does not admit modulational instability .",
    "it should be noted that two bright solitons can induce an effective double - well potential for a nlse described system .",
    "we demonstrate that the tunneling mechanism can be used to explain the breathing behavior between solitons , which is different from the modulational instability mechanism for ab and k - m breather .",
    "then , let us discuss the location breathing behavior of solitons .",
    "it should be noted that the double - well potential is self - induced by the distribution of atoms ( @xmath41 where @xmath43 is the two - soliton solution given above ) .",
    "the structure of double - well evolves simultaneously with the evolution of bright solitons , since atoms tunneling from one soliton to the other change the double well structure synchronously .",
    "therefore , we call it as the tunneling behavior of matter wave in a self - induced double - well potential , in contrast to the external double - well potential in usual quantum theory .",
    "this nonlinear interaction effect brings the soliton s location oscillate with time .",
    "meanwhile , the overlapping of them is heavier , which makes the effective barrier between double well become much lower and narrower ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this makes the tunneling behavior happen greatly .",
    "therefore , the ones in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) demonstrate obvious location oscillation and peak oscillation simultaneously .",
    "bright solitons in fig .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) have much larger distance and weak overlapping between them , which makes the nonlinear interaction between the two solitons much weak .",
    "this brings the ones in fig .",
    "2(c ) demonstrate weak location oscillation , and the ones in fig .",
    "2(d ) admit nearly invisible location oscillation .",
    "moreover , the quantum tunneling and wave - particle duality of soliton have been discussed well in @xcite .",
    "most of them are discussed by studying reflection and transmission coefficients of a soliton colliding on a barrier potential or an interface @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that there are some exotic dynamics for soliton tunneling behavior .",
    "we emphasize that tunneling dynamics here is between bright solitons with no external potential barrier or interface , which is distinctive from the previous studies @xcite .",
    "the effective double - well potential is induced by two bright solitons , and changes with evolution of tunneling dynamics .",
    "it is shown that the tunneling behavior becomes weaker with the distance between two solitons is larger .",
    "how far is the distance between the two solitons proper for the visible tunneling behavior ?",
    "we would like to discuss on this through defining a criterion for the visible tunneling behavior .",
    "since we intend to find how far the largest distance is proper for visible tunneling behavior , the far distance can be used to analyze the two - soliton solution asymptotically .",
    "assuming that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is enough large which means that the distance between solitons is far , we can obtain the asymptotical analysis under the defined conditions .",
    "the left soliton is along the line @xmath48,\\ ] ] and the right one is along the line @xmath49.\\ ] ] the distance between two solitons can be calculated as @xmath50 , which can be used to evaluate the proper distance for visible tunneling behavior . @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the peak values of the two solitons respectively .",
    "it is essential to calculate the particle numbers of two solitons to characterize the tunneling behavior explicitly . to calculate the particle number of each soliton conveniently",
    ", we set @xmath53.\\ ] ] this condition can ensure that @xmath18 is the central point between the two solitons . and",
    "the distance between solitons center in this setting can be calculated as @xmath54 .",
    "then we can define @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the particle numbers of two solitons @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "they are calculated as @xmath59 where    @xmath60 } { ( a_1+a_2)^2\\cosh(2c_{1}-2 c_{2})+(a_1-a_2)^2\\cosh(2c_{1}+2 c_{2})-4 a_{1}a_{2}\\cos(4 ( { a_{{1}}}^ { 2}-{a_{{2}}}^{2})t ) } } .\\ ] ]    based on this , we calculate the exchange particle number between them as @xmath61 .",
    "the temporal period for tunneling behavior is @xmath62 .",
    "especially , it is seen that the tunneling behavior is not a standard cosine form , therefore the tunneling dynamics is different from the linear josephson oscillation , and it is also a type of nonlinear josephson oscillation @xcite .",
    "then , we can define a critical distance value for the visible tunneling behavior as @xmath0 for which the distance between the two solitons centers @xmath63 , the exchange atoms rate between them satisfies @xmath64 .",
    "then the critical distance value can be calculated numerically with certain values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that the critical distance value depends on the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which is related with the profiles of solitons .",
    "for example , the critical distance value is calculated as @xmath65 for the case with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .     and",

    "the above studies just demonstrate that tunneling behavior can be visible for the two solitons with different profiles and the identical velocity .",
    "then , what about other cases for two solitons interactions ? we discuss the case for two solitons with nonzero relative velocity firstly , and then study on the case for two solitons with identical profiles and velocities .",
    "when the two solitons have different initial velocities , they will collide each other .",

    "obviously , @xmath74 and @xmath75 determine soliton s peak and velocity respectively .",
    "one can observe interaction between arbitrary two solitons through varying the parameters .",
    "there are mainly three different cases for interaction process of solitons with different velocities .",
    "firstly , when the two solitons have very small relative velocity , namely , @xmath76 has a small value , we can observe the tunneling behavior of two solitons , as shown fig .",
    "it is seen that the solitons approach and depart each other very slowly .",
    "then how small the relative velocity is proper for visible tunneling behavior ? we can define a critical duration @xmath77 , for which solitons distance is smaller than the critical distance value @xmath0 ( for the cases in fig .",
    "4 , the critical distance can be calculated as @xmath78 ) .",
    "@xmath77 can be evaluated by @xmath79 .",
    "low relative velocity can make the duration @xmath80 be longer than the temporal period @xmath81 for the tunneling behavior of two solitons with different velocities .",
    "we can know that the condition @xmath82 is satisfied for the case in fig .",

    "<S> we investigate tunneling behavior between two bright solitons in a bose - einstein condensate with attractive contact interactions between atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit tunneling properties including tunneling particles and oscillation period are described analytically , which indicates that the periodic tunneling form is a nonlinear josephson type oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the breathing behavior of solitons comes from the tunneling mechanism in an effective double - well potential , which is quite different from the modulational instability mechanism for akhmediev breather and k - m breather . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we obtain a phase diagram for two soliton interaction which admits tunneling property , particle - like property , interference property , and a resonant interaction case . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit conditions for them are clarified based on the defined critical distance @xmath0 and spatial interference period @xmath1 . </S>"
