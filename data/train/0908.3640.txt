    "the existence of very wide halo binaries with separations greater than 0.1 pc has now been firmly established ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cg04 ) .",
    "such systems are intriguing objects for a number of reasons .",
    "first their formation remains a mystery .",
    "indeed in a recent study @xcite show that wide binaries with semi - major axis @xmath0au are too fragile to survive in low or high densities star cluster environments i.e. the environments in which most star formation is thought to take place .",
    "it is not clear if isolated star formation could produce wide binaries either since isolated star forming cores have radii of only about 0.1 pc @xcite .",
    "second wide halo binaries are susceptible to disruption from massive compact bodies , so the distribution of wide halo binaries separations can be used to place constraints on the fraction of the dark matter halo composed of massive compact bodies @xcite .",
    "our knowledge about wide halo binaries is still limited and derives mainly from the work of @xcite  ( @xcite ) , who complied a list of common proper motion candidate binaries selected from the revised new luyten two - tenths catalog ( rnltt ) of stars with proper motions greater than 180 mas / yr @xcite .",
    "the sample listed 116 halo binaries pairs , with only about 10 with projected separation greater than @xmath1 pc .",
    "follow up radial velocity measurement for 4 of these objects with separations greater than @xmath1 pc confirmed that 3 are likely to be truly associated @xcite .",
    "increasing the sample size of wide binaries is important to improve our understanding of these objects and quantify their implications for star formation and dark matter .",
    "as shown in @xcite the existing constraints , derived from the distribution of wide halo binary separations , on compact massive bodies are not robust due to the small sample size .",
    "larger samples are needed , moreover , to investigate the dependence of the wide binary separation distribution function on galactic orbit . also , with an expanded sample , the possibility of tracing the origin of groups of wide binaries to common recently disrupted galactic satellites via integrals of motion @xcite is enhanced .",
    "in addition , a number of other astrophysical applications , such as testing and constraining photo - parallax relations @xcite , would benefit from increasing the sample of wide binaries .    here",
    "we discuss results of a search in the recently published sdss stripe 82 catalog @xcite for new wide halo binaries .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first give an overview of the the strip 82 survey in section  [ sec : stripe82 ] , then in section  [ sec : halo ] we discuss how we select halo stars from the survey .",
    "section  [ sec : search ] describes how we identify wide halo binaries and presents a list of new candidates .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : end ] we outline applications for the new sample and summarize our results .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ? * ) is a multicolour imaging and spectroscopic survey that has mapped more than a 1/4 of the sky towards the north galactic pole .",
    "the imaging is done with the 5 photometric bands @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite",
    ". a @xmath7 strip along the celestial equator ( towards the south galactic pole ) from right ascension @xmath8 to @xmath9 , known as stripe 82 has been repeatedly imaged by sdss , from 1998 to 2005 , to permit deeper studies and measure variability .",
    "@xcite have created a stripe 82 light - motion catalog by cross - matching objects from the various imaging runs .",
    "the catalog contains almost 4 million light and motion curves of stellar and galactic objects .",
    "each light - motion curve consists of around 30 epochs over a baseline of 6 - 7 years .",
    "in addition a higher - level catalog ( hlc ) has been created by @xcite .",
    "this provides a range of quantities derived from the light - motion catalog , including mean position , proper motion and mean magnitudes in the five photometric bands .",
    "it is the hlc we mine in search of wide halo binaries .",
    "the hlc is at present ( 2009 ) the deepest photometric and astrometric variability catalog of its kind and is complete down to magnitude 21.5 in @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and 20.5 in @xmath6 .",
    "the photometric range is 14 - 21.5 in @xmath4 with photometric rms scatter of @xmath10 mmag down to @xmath4 @xmath11 which rises exponentially to 100 mmag at @xmath4=21.5 .",
    "typically proper motion errors are @xmath124 mas / yr .    the stripe 82 survey provides a number of advantages over the rnltt survey in the context of searching for wide halo binaries .",
    "the magnitude limits of stripe 82 mean it probes much further away from the disk dominated solar neighbourhood than rnltt survey ( which is complete down to v=19 and probes out to @xmath12 250 pc from the solar position ) .",
    "proper motion errors for objects in stripe 82 are also slightly better and the proper motion threshold of @xmath13 mas / yr does not apply .",
    "another advantage is that the stripe 82 survey provides accurate photometry in 2 widely - spaced color bands , namely g and i , which is important for among other things selecting halo stars from the catalog .",
    "in contrast , errors in the v band used in rnltt can be up to 0.25 mag .",
    "on the other hand , the rnltt covers 44% of the sky compared to 0.7% for stripe 82 , so the density of random visual pairs is likely to be much higher in stripe 82 searches .",
    "we note another possible approach to search for new wide binaries is to match the single epoch sdss data ( @xmath14 ) with older photometric / proper motion surveys .",
    "in fact a number of groups have investigated this avenue by combining sdss with usno - b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* with the latter focusing on wide disk binaries ) .",
    "while this approach covers a larger fraction of the sky , it is about 1.5 mags less deep than stripe 82 .",
    "the preliminary finding of @xcite is that proper motions and photometry alone are not enough to define high probability candidates constructed from the union of sdss and usno - b ; follow up radial velocities are needed to prune the sample . below",
    "we show that it is possible to find a new robust sample of wide halo binaries in stripe 82 with just proper motions and photometry .",
    "the first problem to overcome in the search for halo binary stars from the stripe 82 catalog is the question of how to select a clean sample of halo stars ( subdwarfs ) from the mix of stellar populations in the catalog .",
    "subdwarfs can be identified directly by their position in the hr diagram or features in their spectra . for the vast majority of stars in stripe 82",
    "neither spectra ( but see section [ sec : vrad ] ) , nor accurate parallaxes are available . with only proper motion and photometry on hand , the reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram",
    "is a common tool employed to pick out subdwarfs from the disk stars . in this diagram , the reduced proper motion , which we take as h@xmath15 , with @xmath4 the apparent magnitude in the @xmath4-band and @xmath16 the proper motion in arcseconds per year , is plotted against the stellar colour .",
    "the reduced proper motion exploits the differences in metalicity and kinematics between subdwarfs and disk stars .",
    "since halo stars do not rotate about the galaxy as fast as main sequence disk stars and are fainter at the same colour , the rpm is typically larger for subdwarfs compared to disk main sequence stars at a given temperature .",
    "the colour adopted in the rpm diagram is a proxy for temperature and is chosen to enhance the separation of the halo subdwarfs from the disk main sequence stars .",
    "after some experimentation we found that the @xmath17 color leads to a reasonable division .",
    "this choice for colour and the form for h@xmath18 have appeared before in the literature , to construct rpm diagrams for stripe 82 in order to search for new white dwarf candidates @xcite and to study the kinematics of the stellar halo , ( @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ) , while @xcite constructed a similar rpm diagram from the union of sdss and usno - b across the entire sdss footpath to define a sample in which to search for wide disk binaries .",
    "errors in proper motion measurements and also the intrinsic spread of velocities for a given population will mask the separation in the diagram .",
    "we limit the influence of proper motion errors by selecting stars in the catalog with proper motions larger than 40 mas / yr and with proper motion errors less than 5 mas / yr , the latter corresponding to a error of about 0.3 in h@xmath18 . errors in photometry also blur the separation in the rpm diagram .",
    "we require that the error of the mean photometry in the @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 bands to be less than 0.05 mags .",
    "these introduce an error in h@xmath18 of less than 0.05 and 0.07 in the colour .",
    "the reduced proper motion diagram is plotted , for the 32644 stars in the hlc that met the above criteria in figure  [ rpm ] .",
    "we can see that stars are found in 3 groups : white dwarfs ; subdwarfs and disk stars .",
    "the white dwarfs to the lower left hand side of the diagram are clearly separated from the other groups .",
    "we use the separators put forward in @xcite to divide the white dwarfs from the rest of the stars .",
    "for @xmath19 the separator is defined as h@xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 it is defined as h@xmath22 .",
    "it is not as clear cut where to draw the boundary between the disk main sequence stars and the subdwarfs , but since the rpm is equivalent to combining the absolute magnitude and the logarithm of the magnitude of the tangential velocity of the star , we can use a photo - parallax relation to define a boundary in the rpm diagram for a given tangential velocity .",
    "* hereafter i08 ) , provide a photometric parallax relation for stars observed in sdss colors .",
    "the relation gives the absolute magnitude in the @xmath4-band , m@xmath18 as a function of colour , @xmath17 , and metalicity , [ fe / h ] , as follows @xmath23 - 0.18[fe / h]^{2}.\\\\\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this relation with the metalicity set to be -1.5 dex ( corresponding to the median halo metalicity as reported in i08 ) and 220 km / s for the tangential velocity we find that , as shown in figure  [ rpm ] , the resultant rpm boundary does a good job of defining a disk / subdwarf divider consistent with the apparent division discernible by visual inspection .",
    "cg04 made similar use of the rpm diagram to classify binaries as disk or subdwarfs .",
    "the definition of their disk / subdwarf separator contained a dependence on galactic latitude , @xmath24 .",
    "we assess the need for such a dependence in our sample , which covers a narrower range in @xmath24 than the cg04 sample , by plotting the distribution of the differences between the value of h@xmath18 and the value of our separator at the colour of the star for groups of stars binned in @xmath24 .",
    "if the separator has a significant dependence on @xmath24 we can expect to see a systematic shift in the distribution of these differences as @xmath24 changes . as figure  [ rpmdiff ] shows there is no indication that we are detecting such a shift .",
    "therefore , we define the halo subdwarf sample as the stars in the rpm diagram lying between the white dwarf and photo - parallax based divisions . this selection produces a sample of 6419 subdwarfs .",
    "with the sample of halo stars now defined , we can proceed to search for binary pairs .",
    "the simplest approach is to count the number of subdwarf pairs as a function of angular separation , @xmath25 , on the sky .",
    "however , this simpleminded approach fails to deal with problem of chance close pairs of stars .",
    "the contamination due to these random pairs , @xmath26 , depends on the surface density of stars in the catalog and for small @xmath25 we can expect roughly that @xmath27 .",
    "the actual number of stellar pairs , @xmath28 , for the stripe 82 subdwarf sample , in equal logarithmic bins of angular separation , is shown in the lefthand panel of figure  [ ang_halo ] . in order to estimate the signal from chance pairs ,",
    "we fit a power law using a likelihood method to the distribution of pair separations with @xmath29 .",
    "we see this adequately fits the data beyond @xmath30 .",
    "the signal in excess of the fit inside @xmath31 is most likely attributable to genuine binaries . this signal though is clearly not well described by a power law with an index -1.57 , as observed for the binary angular separation function in cg04 .",
    "this could be due to blending which reduces the efficiency of detecting pairs closer than @xmath32 when good photometry is demanded , as noted in @xcite and @xcite . according to the i08 relation with metalicity -1.5 dex ,",
    "the subdwarf sample lie at median distance of 1.3 kpc , so the plot implies that the direct search for candidate wide binaries becomes dominated by the signal from random pairs at separations of around 0.05 pc and suffers from blending for binaries with separations less than about 0.01 pc .",
    "since our goal is to generate a reliable list of candidates rather than a complete list with many false contaminants , we must exploit the proper motion and photometric information to cut down on the signal from random pairs .",
    "as the typical distances to the binaries is around a kpc , the proper motion differences for wide binaries , arising from relative orbital velocity and projection effects due to the angular separation in the sky , fall below the typical proper motion error .",
    "consequently , we incorporate a proper motion constraint in our wide binary selection procedure by requiring that the magnitude of the vector proper motion differences for candidate pairs is less than 5 mas / yr ( roughly the typical relative proper motion error ) .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ ang_halo ] displays the outcome for f(@xmath33 ) on imposing this constraint .",
    "the effect is to reduce the amplitude of the signal from random pairs , found using the same technique as before , by over an order of magnitude , without seriously compromising the genuine binary signal in the inner region .",
    "we can go further and apply photometric constraints in the selection process .",
    "unfortunately there are no well - defined sdss colour - magnitude relations that cover the entire colour range for halo subdwarfs which means we can not fully exploit the excellent stripe 82 photometry .",
    "the source of the problem is the fact that sdss has a bright magnitude limit greater than the faint magnitude limit of the hipparcos survey , which measured accurate distances to nearby bright stars permitting photo - parallax relations to be constructed from them .",
    "as mentioned above , i08 presented a photo - parallax relation for sdss colours . the blue end ( @xmath34 ) of this relation",
    "is grounded on observations of stars in globular clusters with known distances",
    ". however , the red end has been constrained only with disk stars .",
    "the photo - parallax relation from io8 should predict that each member of a pair have a similar value for the difference between the model absolute magnitude and the apparent magnitude i.e the quantity @xmath35 should be centered about zero , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the absolute magnitude from the i08 relation and the observed apparent magnitude of one of the components in the binary , and ditto for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we test the relation of i08 on the the 14 pairs with @xmath40 satisfying the common proper motion criterion , which we assume for the moment are all genuine binaries .",
    "we find the median and standard deviation in the distribution of @xmath41 for the binary sample turn out to be 0.04 and 0.55 mags respectively . the scatter is larger than the formal error in @xmath41 which is less than @xmath1 mags , as the median photometric errors of the 14 pairs are smaller than 0.01 mags in @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the large scatter might point to the limitations of the photo - parallax relation .",
    "alternatively , the wide binary sample may include a number with an unresolved triplet .",
    "we get similar scatter if we use the binary candidates to fit a quadratic polynomial colour - magnitude relationship , @xmath42 .",
    "( it turns out that attempting to fit higher order polynomials leads to unphysical colour magnitude relations . ) of course , in this approach the constant term is not constrained , so distances to the objects can not be directly determined .",
    "we produce a final homogeneously selected sample of wide binary candidates by requiring that in addition to the proper motion constraint , @xmath41 from the i08 relation should be less than 0.8 mags ( @xmath12 1.5 times the scatter and corresponding to a distance uncertainty of around 400 pc at 1 kpc ) .",
    "the right hand panel of figure  [ ang_halo ] shows the improvement on applying this requirement .",
    "we see that the amplitude of the signal from random pairs falls by a factor of about 2 .",
    "wide binaries can be detected now with little contamination out to @xmath12 40@xmath43 . in table",
    "[ tab_cand ] we provide a list of the @xmath44 new candidate halo binaries with @xmath45 that meet the proper motion and photometric constraints .",
    "we estimate that the sample contains about one contaminant based on the cumulative distribution of the fit to the random pairs .",
    "the photo - parallax proviso removed 2 pairs with @xmath40 that met the proper motion constraint .",
    "one of these which has @xmath46 is probably spurious because the bluest star in this pair is almost a magnitude fainter than its apparent partner .",
    "the other object has @xmath47 with one of the components close to the magnitude limit in @xmath4 .",
    "we list this object also in table  [ tab_cand ] , as the signal from random pairs is negligible at its angular separation ( see middle panel of figure  [ ang_halo ] ) .    in an effort to boost the sample size further ,",
    "we have considered reducing the proper motion threshold , but tightening the photo - parallax constraint to compensate for the increase in contamination from spurious pairs . however , these experiments failed to produce a larger sample of robust wide binary candidates . lowering the threshold , as alluded to in section 3.1 ,",
    "also runs the risk of increasing the contamination from the disk stars as the separation between components in the rpm diagram is not as well defined .",
    "we have mentioned above that sdss is also a spectroscopic survey and a large sample of stellar spectra have been taken across the sdss footprint ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , so it is important to investigate if we can factor in radial velocity or metalicity information into the binary search . on cross matching with the sdss catalog of stellar spectra we find that 781 objects , about 12% of the subdwarf sample , including 5 stars from the homogeneous selected new wide binaries which we list in table [ tab_2 ] , have radial velocities with errors less than 15 km / s . while a non - negligible fraction , the available radial velocity information is not ideal for improving the detection efficiency or characterizing the distribution of wide binaries",
    "this is because of a restriction in the sdss spectroscopic plate which requires targets to be separated on the sky by at least an arc - minute ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure  [ r_ang_halo ] ) .",
    "so , for @xmath48 where the signal for wide binaries is strongest we can not make use of a common radial velocity constraint on candidate pairs analogous to the common proper motion one . not surprisingly , if we nonetheless repeat the search as before but include a radial velocity constraint for any pairs in which both components have radial velocity measurements , we find that the fits to the distribution of random pairs are virtually identical to the corresponding ones in figure  [ ang_halo ] .",
    "we also carried out a search in the subsample of 781 objects with radial velocities for wide binaries .",
    "this failed to produce any candidates , in fact the proper motion and radial velocity constraints together are powerful enough to eliminate any of the potential pairs with separations out to 1000@xmath43 ( @xmath49 pc ) , which make up the signal in figure  [ r_ang_halo ] .    by lowering the original proper motion threshold of 40 mas / yr , it is possible to get a larger sample of stripe 82 subdwarfs with radial velocities .",
    "indeed @xcite have created a sample of 1717 subdwarfs from stripe 82 with radial velocities and proper motions without imposing a proper motion threshold , in order to study the kinematics of the stellar halo .",
    "we have looked also in this sample but found no high probability candidates .",
    "the proper motion and radial velocity cuts leave a pair distribution consistent with a random distribution of pairs . adding a photo - parallax constraint and/or a common metalicity constraint",
    "just reduces the amplitude of this signal without revealing any excess that might be due to very wide binaries .",
    "the significance of these null detections of wide binaries with @xmath50 is not easy to interpret since for these samples we have no handle on number of wide binaries at smaller @xmath33 because of the spectroscopic target selection effects .",
    "in this paper we have described a search for wide halo binaries in sdss stripe 82 . our main result is table [ tab_cand ] , which provides the first set of high probability wide halo binary candidates observed in sdss colours .",
    "as the projected separations lie between roughly 0.01 and 0.25 pc , the new sample serves as a useful addition to the cg04 sample of wide binaries . over the interval @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 the sample obtained with the proper motion and photometric constraints is clean and likely free from selection effects as a function of @xmath25 , so we can use it to find the power law that best characterizes the observed angular separation function .",
    "our best fit leads to a power law index of -1.25@xmath53 .",
    "this is not as steep as the power law found in cg04 but they are consistent within the uncertainty of the value of the fitted index .",
    "the deficit of pairs just outside @xmath52 would appear to be inconsistent with a flatter power law unless it steepens , for example due to the action of compact dark matter bodies .",
    "however , for the moment this must remain a speculation , as the small size of our new sample relative to cg04 precludes any improvements on current dark matter constraints from wide halo binaries .",
    "future surveys though , such as pan - starrs @xcite gaia or the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite will enable vaster samples of wide binaries to be selected with the aid of more stringent proper motion and trigonometric or photo - parallax constraints . for example ,",
    "the 3.5 year pan - starrs ps1 3@xmath54 survey , which is due to begin this year , will observe 3/4 of the sky in the 5 stellar filters ( @xmath55 ) with a predicted proper motion accuracy of 1.2 mas / yr @xcite .",
    "if we simply scale up the numbers found in stripe 82 by this increased sky coverage , then the ps1 survey will yield at least 2000 wide halo binaries over an order of magnitude greater than than cg04 sample size . such a sample would be hugely influential for advancing our understanding of these objects and placing robust constraints on the nature of dark matter .    in the meantime",
    "spectroscopic observations of our new binary candidates for radial velocities and metalicites could be scientifically fruitful .",
    "as figure  [ col ] shows , many of the binaries span a wide range in spectral type and are therefore of particular importance in testing and constraining sdss subdwarf photo - parallax relations .",
    "indeed we pointed out that the scatter in the @xmath41 values in our sample is larger than expected for the i08 photo - parallax relation for subdwarfs stars .",
    "if this is due to unresolved triplets , spectroscopic observations could uncover evidence for this . in any case metalicities for the new sample would allow more complicated colour - magnitude relations , that change systematically with metalicity , to be tested .    with radial velocities from spectra , it will be possible to analyse the galactic orbit of the objects , allowing one to address questions such as whether there is a trend in binary separation and the galactic orbit averaged dark matter density .",
    "another application that could be carried out , following spectroscopic observations of the sample , is to search for associations of wide binaries in integral of motion and metalicity parameter space , testing the idea put forward by @xcite that wide halo binaries may have survived disruption in the galaxy on account of being recently accreted from disrupted satellites .",
    "we give a foretaste of such a test using the five new binaries with spectra from our sample , along with the cg04 wide halo binaries with projected separations larger than 0.01 pc and which radial velocities have been measured for one or both pairs .",
    "this is given in figure [ integrals ] , which shows the components of the angular momentum perpendicular and parallel to the symmetry axis of the galactic plane , j@xmath56 and j@xmath57 in units of kpc.km.s@xmath58 respectively .",
    "the use of these two components is a common approach since they are adiabatic invariants in a spherical potential .",
    "also included in this figure are the contours from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure 6 ) showing over - densities in this space for halo subdwarfs within 2.5 kpc .",
    "the over - density located around ( j@xmath59 , j@xmath60 ) is the potential accretion remnant identified by @xcite and we can see that a couple of the wide binaries are possibly associated to this feature . none of the other binaries appear to be associated to any over - densities of more than 3 sigma , although it is worth noting the possible clumping amongst the binaries themselves .",
    "as more radial velocities become available it will be interesting to see how the distribution of wide binaries take shapes in this plot .",
    "pockets of tight associations would be evidence in favour of any scheme in which the formation of wide binaries is associated with the disruption of a large stellar system .",
    "although some care may need to be taken in interpreting possible clumps on account of the complicated selection effects that have gone into defining the sample , we do not expect this application or indeed the other ones we have proposed for our new wide binary sample , to be seriously effected by these .
