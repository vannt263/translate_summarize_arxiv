    "the atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite , including the most recent 1489 super - k data sample provide strong evidence for @xmath5 oscillations into an active neutrino ( mainly @xmath6 ) with @xmath7  @xcite . on the other hand , apart from confirming , once again , the long - standing solar neutrino problem  @xcite , the recent results from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite have given strong evidence that solar neutrinos convert mainly to an active neutrino flavor .",
    "this suggests that an extension of the standard model of particle physics is necessary in the lepton sector , capable of incorporating the required @xmath8 conversion .",

    "@xmath12 , which we tacitly assume in order to reconcile the lsnd anomaly with solar and atmospheric data , these schemes can naturally be divided into two very different classes , usually called ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) mass schemes  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that ( 3 + 1 ) mass spectra include the three - active neutrino scenario as limiting case . in this case",
    "solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are explained by active neutrino oscillations , with mass - squared differences @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the fourth neutrino state gets completely decoupled .",
    "we will refer to such limiting scenario as ( 3 + 0 ) .",
    "in contrast , the ( 2 + 2 ) spectrum is intrinsically different , as there must be a significant contribution of the sterile neutrino either in solar or in atmospheric neutrino oscillations or in both .    in recent studies  @xcite",

    "we find that both the sno nc result as well as the 1489-day super - k atmospheric neutrino data strongly reject against sterile neutrino conversions .",

    "for simplicity we neglect cp - violating phases , whose effects are expected to be small in the experiments we consider , due to the strong hierarchy of the mass - squared differences required by the experimental data .",
    "this leaves us with nine parameters altogether relevant for the description of cp conserving four - neutrino oscillations : 6 mixing angles contained in the mixing matrix and 3 mass - squared differences .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite it is very important to adopt a convenient choice for these parameters in order to factorize the analysis .",

    "the exclusion of four - neutrino oscillation schemes of the ( 2 + 2)-type is based on the improved sensitivity of solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments to oscillations into a sterile neutrino , thanks to recent experimental data .",
    "this is a very robust result , independent of whether the lsnd experiment is confirmed or disproved .",
    "the exclusion of ( 3 + 1 ) schemes depends somehow on the used lsnd data sample . ] .",
    "furthermore , it heavily relies on the results of negative sbl experiments , especially on the bugey and cdhs disappearance experiments .",
    "therefore , if lsnd should be confirmed by miniboone , it will be crucial to improve the experimental data on sbl @xmath95 and/or @xmath96 disappearance .",
    "if the signal in lsnd should indeed stem from oscillations in a ( 3 + 1 ) mass scheme the sbl @xmath95 and @xmath96 disappearance amplitude must be just on the edge of the sensitivity of current experiments .    in summary , the interpretation of the global neutrino oscillation data including lsnd in terms of four - neutrino mass schemes  in either ( 3 + 1 ) or ( 2 + 2 ) realizations  is strongly disfavoured .",
    "in the best case we obtain a parameter g.o.f .  of only 0.56% .",
    "the analysis we have presented brings the lsnd anomaly to a theoretically more puzzling status indeed . we want to note that also introducing more sterile neutrinos participating in the oscillations is unlikely to substantially improve the situation @xcite .",
    "if lsnd should be confirmed by the results of the miniboone experiment the situation will become even more puzzling .",
    "examples of more far - fetched alternative explanations are the possibility of lepton number violating muon decay  @xcite or large cpt violation in the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "such scenarios will be crucially tested at the upcoming experiments miniboone  @xcite and kamland  @xcite .",
    "in the global analysis of oscillation data in the framework of four - neutrino schemes we are faced with the problem that for a given mass scheme some data are in conflict with each other . in this appendix",
    "we present two statistical methods to evaluate quantitatively whether such data sets are consistent with each other .",
    "suppose a theoretical model characterized by @xmath97 parameters @xmath98 and @xmath22 statistically independent experiments ( or data sets ) described by the theory .",
    "each of these experiments may consist of many data points ; experiment @xmath99 observes @xmath100 data points .",
    "furthermore , experiment @xmath99 may in general depend only on @xmath101 parameters @xmath102 , which is a sub - set of all parameters @xmath103 of the full theory , leading to the @xmath55-function @xmath104 the three terms are distributed with @xmath105 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "the global @xmath55 is given by @xmath106 usually the goodness - of - fit ( g.o.f . )",
    "is evaluated by considering the value of @xmath107 , which is distributed with @xmath108 d.o.f . , where @xmath109 .",
    "let us assume , that all the experiments considered _ separately _ lead to a good fit : @xmath110 .",
    "however , there may be some disagreement between different experiments .",
    "if the number of data points is very large the disagreement may be completely washed out and the usual g.o.f .  would be very good , i.e.   @xmath111 despite the disagreement .",
    "here we propose two methods which are more useful in global analyses with many data points , like in the four - neutrino case .",
    "let us consider the case of two data sets ( @xmath112 ) , which have @xmath113 parameters @xmath114 in common .",
    "then at a given c.l .",
    "the allowed regions for the parameters @xmath114 according to each data set are determined by two @xmath55 functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where we minimize with respect to the other parameters .",
    "now we calculate @xmath65 , defined as the minimal @xmath84 value where there is still some overlap between the allowed parameter regions of the two data sets .",
    "this @xmath65 has to be evaluated for @xmath117 d.o.f .  to obtain the c.l .",
    "at which there exists still some values of the parameters such that both data sets are consistent .",
    "we call this criterion _ parameter consistency test_. it can be applied if the global data can be divided into _ two _ potentially conflicting sets .",
    "similar methods have been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to evaluate the consistency of lsnd and nev experiments in ( 3 + 1 ) schemes and in ref .",
    "@xcite to check the compatibility of lsnd and karmen .",
    "let us write the global @xmath55 eq .",
    "( [ glob ] ) in the following way : @xmath118 to evaluate the g.o.f .",
    "we now use only the second term : @xmath119 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) describes the g.o.f .",
    "of all the experiments taken alone , whereas @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( [ new ] ) corresponds to the contribution to the total minimum @xmath107 which stems from the _ combination _ of the data sets .",
    "the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ new ] ) are distributed with @xmath121 d.o.f .",
    ", respectively .",
    "hence , to check the g.o.f .  we just have to evaluate @xmath122 we call this criterion _ parameter goodness of fit _ and in general it is more stringent than the parameter consistency test ( for an illustration see fig .",
    "[ fig : sol+atm ] ) .    if @xmath123 experiments depend on the parameter @xmath124 we have the obvious relation @xmath125 , and the relevant number of d.o.f .  given in eq .",
    "( [ pg ] ) can be written as @xmath126 . from this relation",
    "we see that parameters relevant for only one experiment ( @xmath127 ) do not contribute because they are minimized and contribute only to the individual @xmath128 which are not considered in @xmath66 .",
    "what is tested is only the parameter dependence of the data sets relevant for the _",
    "combination_.    _ a simple example : _ let us consider the case of only one parameter @xmath129 , which is determined by 2 experiments . hence , we have @xmath112 and @xmath130 and @xmath131 $ ] , which has to be evaluated for 1 d.o.f .. the following statement is easy to prove : let @xmath132 and @xmath133 be the best fit values of the two experiments ( @xmath134 ) . then the c.l .",
    "at which @xmath135 is consistent with zero is identical to the parameter goodness of fit .",
    "we are grateful to w.c .",
    "louis and g.  mills for providing us with the table of the global lsnd likelihood function .",
