    "investigation of the phase diagram of hot and dense matter aims to clarify the role of phase transitions between partonic and hadronic states , search for the critical point , and explore the exotic degrees of freedom predicted by nuclear physics and low - energy quantum chomodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "lattice qcd works well in the high - temperature and low - density part of the phase diagram while , high - energy heavy - ion collisions have the focus on the critical point . testing the cold , superdense , strongly interacting matter in the zero - temperature and high - density limit , compact stars are the best ( celestial ) laboratories , especially through the observation of astrophysical properties of these extreme objects",
    ".    however , there is no direct observation of the inner structure of a compact star , some physical properties like the measured mass - radius relation , moment of inertia , rotation period , magnetic field and the soon - to - be - available gravitational wave observations support to build and parametrize realistic equations of state ( eos ) in the non - perturbative and high - density qcd regime .",
    "this is one of the main goal of the working group 2 of the `` newcompstar cost action mp1304 '' , which developed a continously - evolving online database , compose  @xcite for neutron star eos .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the correspondence between non - interacting multi - hadron fermion star equation of state in the many - flavor limit to the many degrees of freedom of a kaluza ",
    "klein compact star .",
    "we introduce the description of a compact star in the kaluza ",
    "klein world with one extra compactified dimension and show how excited states can be connected to the hadron spectra , especially in the many - flavor limit , assuming more - and - more massive hadron states .",
    "we present the effect of increasing the degrees of freedom on the equation of state and the connection of this conception to the mass - radius relation , @xmath0 in compact stars .",
    "we present the dependence of the maximum mass of the star , @xmath1 as a function of the maximum number of excited states , @xmath2 and the size of the compactified extra dimension , @xmath3 .",
    "in the kaluza  klein model the gravity and quantum field theory can be unified at energy scale lower than the planck s scale  @xcite . in the simplest case a @xmath4 dimensional space - time can be introduced , where excited particles can move freely along the extra @xmath5 spatial direction as well . in this manner",
    "we geometrize quantum fields , where charges are associated with compactified spatial extra dimensions , induced by the topological structure of the space - time .",
    "the compactness of the extra dimension generates a periodic boundary condition , which results a bohr - type quantization condition for the @xmath6 momentum component . applying a generalized heisenberg uncertainty formula ,",
    "the relation induces an uncertainty in the position with the size ( volume ) of @xmath7 .",
    "an interesting feature of this space - time structure , that motion into the 5^th^ dimension generates an extra mass term by @xmath6 , what appears as excited mass , @xmath8 in the standard @xmath9-dimensional space - time , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the particle mass in the 5-dimensional description , and @xmath2 is the excitation number .",
    "considering a compactified radius @xmath12 cm this extra mass gap is @xmath13 mev , which is an available value in hadron spectroscopy by the tev energy accelerators , such as the large hadron collider  @xcite or even in superdense compact stars as in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in this framework",
    "the extra compactified 5^th^ dimension represents the hypercharge or the similar quantum number ( strangeness , charm , or bottomness ) connected to even several number of flavors .",
    "the masses of the kaluza  klein excited states ( or degrees of freedom ) can be calculated by the formula  . in table",
    "[ tab : kk - masses ] we listed these masses in mev units up to excitation number @xmath14 and compactified radius values for @xmath150.01 , 0.1 , 0.33 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 10 fm with @xmath16 mev .",
    "one can observe , higher @xmath2 results more massive baryons , but larger @xmath3 turns excited - state structure more dense to each other like in case of many flavor .",

    "klein degrees of freedom in mev units , @xmath17 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "based on the above model on the degrees of freedom , we present our results for the eos in the case of non - interacting fermion gas in @xmath4 dimensional space - time with excitations , @xmath2 and @xmath3 values as highlighted above . on fig .",
    "[ fig : eos - mr ] the calculated @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 curves are plotted from the top to the bottom panels respectively .",
    "the above thermodynamical variables were derived for any states @xmath22 , from the generalized thermodynamical potential , @xmath23 as presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in general",
    ", one reads from the graphs that increasing the @xmath3 makes softer the eos , and _ vice versa _ , @xmath24 results stiffer one .",
    "moreover , for the low-@xmath25/low-@xmath26 sector , increasing the number of possible excitations , @xmath2 , does not make any sense with the eos with the smallest @xmath3 values , on the other hand , at larger @xmath3 values , the opening of the large number of excited states results more softer eos .",
    "this is due to the well - populated d.o.f .",

    "the @xmath0 diagram clearly presents that decreasing the @xmath3 , the maximum mass , @xmath1 of the star is getting larger , since the eos of the star becomes stiffer . as getting @xmath27 the @xmath1 increases and saturates to a maximum @xmath28 , independently of the @xmath2 . as increasing",
