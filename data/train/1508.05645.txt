    "a better understanding of the important length scales over which intermediate structures are present would provide new routes to connect particle - scale properties to bulk properties . in this paper , we take the growing field of network science as our inspiration @xcite .",
    "network techniques can be applied to such varied systems as social networks , neural systems , or airline route maps : anything which can be reduced to a network of nodes and the edges ( links ) that connect them . in the sphere packings studied here ,",
    "the network is composed of a set of particles ( nodes ) and the normal contact force between adjacent particles ( edges ) .",
    "the use of network science techniques has attracted significant attention in the past few years , particularly as a way to extract the `` backbone '' of the most important particles in the system , and to follow the evolution of those networks under loading . by considering the entire network",
    "@xcite it is possible extract statistics about the degree of connectivity among the particles , and how that influences the bulk response .",
    "one approach has been to define the main network based on a set of rules about how particles in a force chain should be connected .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite define the backbone by setting a threshold value for contact forces and the angles between particles , while @xcite use a topological invariant called the zeroth betti number @xcite to characterize the size of connected clusters .",
    "a disadvantage of these approaches is that thresholding strictly removes the weak interparticle contacts from consideration , even though of these forces are thought to play an important role in providing lateral stability @xcite . to address this issue , it is possible to use community - detection techniques @xcite that allow for optimized partitioning into clusters without a hard threshold .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite identified force clusters which have stronger interparticle forces within each cluster than between them .",
    "however , the force chain communities detected in this way take the form of compact domains rather than branched networks",
    ". therefore , they seem unlikely to be the correct mesoscale units from which to explain sound propagation @xcite ( observed to be along force chains ) or the changing network of contacts under flow @xcite ( they form a giant component of broken links ) .    recently , @xcite recognized that community - detection algorithms which depend on a random null model miss an important aspect of granular materials : that grains are geographically constrained to be connected only to their neighbors . by working with a null model that respects these geographic constraints ,",
    "the detected communities take the form of the expected branched structures . this _ geographical null model _",
    ", when applied to either simulated ( frictionless ) or laboratory ( frictional ) packings of disks , was able to distinguish the different force chain morphologies of the two distinct datasets .    in this paper",
    ", we adapt this technique to perform a similar community detection in simulations of 3d granular packings , and examine how these communities systematically change as a function of confining pressure and interparticle friction . by using simulations",
    ", we can test the methods in a controlled environment where it is possible to generate many independent realizations .",
    "increasingly , such data is becoming available in 3d granular experiments @xcite , in the form of normal contact forces measured from the macroscopic deformations of soft particles .",
    "the community detection method consists of two steps , modularity maximization to partition the network into clusters , and selecting a resolution parameter which controls the total number and shape of these clusters . to perform the maximization",
    ", we use the same geographic null model as in @xcite , allowing us to incorporate contact information . in selecting a resolution parameter",
    ", we found that the previous technique @xcite was inadequate for 3d systems .",
    "therefore , we developed a new figure of merit to quantify the degree of branching within the communities , based on the convex hull of the constituent particles .",
    "when the process is complete , each packing is partitioned into a set of branched communities ( with many interstitial communities consisting of only a few weak - force particles ) .",
    "we characterize the ensemble of communities by their size , strength , and degree of branching as a function of both interparticle friction and pressure .",

    "the simulation cell has lateral dimensions @xmath6 ( periodic boundary conditions in both directions ) and height @xmath7 ( open at the top , closed at the bottom ) with gravity acting downwards . to model a hard , frictional granular material , we use a hertzian contact model with a normal elastic constant @xmath8 and a tangential elastic constant @xmath9 . these values , when re - dimensionalized , approximately correspond to ruby spheres @xcite of centimetric size .",
    "we vary the interparticle friction coefficient over seven values @xmath10 to examine the dependence of our results on interparticle friction .",
    "we mimic experimental protocols in which particles are poured into a box from above , and then compressed via a uniform pressure .",
    "our numerical pouring method , adapted from @xcite , mimics pouring particles through a sieve ( to prevent the formation of a conical heap ) by generating particles at random positions at the top of the simulation volume and allowing them to fall downward under the force of gravity .",
    "we select a very low packing fraction @xmath11 for this insertion region , so that the resulting mean coordination number @xmath12 is independent of the choice of @xmath13 @xcite . after inserting all particles into the container",
    ", we allow the kinetic energy to dissipate until it is less than @xmath14 @xcite .    for each such initial packing , we apply pressure by generating a massless slab ( size @xmath15 , fcc lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lammps ] ) at the top of the packing . from this initial state ( compressed by gravity , but no additional pressure ) we apply an increasing series pressures ( @xmath16 , measured in units of @xmath17 ) to the upper surface of the resulting packing .",
    "the magnitude of the non - dimensionalized confining pressure is just below those reported in recent experiments on softer particles @xcite .",
    "after the kinetic energy of the system has again dissipated , we record position and force measurements before iterating through all 6 pressure values . at each step , we record all particle positions and interparticle forces ; sample normal force networks are shown in fig .",

    "we use a bootstrap - like process ( sampling with replacement ) to confirm that this is sufficient for reliable statistics . in a few places , noted within the text , the fluctuations were large enough that this criterion was not satisfied . in all of our analyses , we consider only the normal component of the interparticle forces , as is currently measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "this simplification also allows us to directly compare both frictionless and frictional packings .",
    "our goal is to partition the granular packing into _ communities _ of particles which have high interparticle forces internally ( locally stiff ) and low interparticle forces in their connections to other communities .",
    "we build on the work of @xcite , which utilizes the open source network analysis tool genlouvain ( version 2.0 ) from netwiki @xcite to implement the modularity maximization method @xcite of community detection .",

    "the optimization process adjusts the community assignments for fixed @xmath25 and fixed null model .",
    "as developed in @xcite , we utilize a physically - motivated _ geographic null model _ in which particles connect to a community through their direct neighbors : @xmath35 we chose not to use the more common newman - girvan null model @xcite which allows for arbitrary connections between particles @xcite because in 2d packings of disks , the geographic null model has been shown to successfully generate communities with chain - like morphologies @xcite ( rather than compact domains ) .",
    "because modularity maximization ( finding the largest value of @xmath23 ) is an np - hard problem , the published methods @xcite use a greedy heuristic algorithm . to test the stability of this method",
    ", we run this algorithm 100 times on the same force network and find that the fluctuation of maximal value of the modularity @xmath23 is within 1% .",
    "in addition , we observe that the 15 largest communities consist of the same core group of particles : 70% of the same subset of particles are included in 90% of the iterations .",
    "we additionally find that fluctuations in @xmath23 are not accompanied by fluctuations in the morphology of the detected communities ( to be quantified in  [ sec : morph ] ) .",
    "the choice of resolution parameter @xmath25 controls the total number of communities identified , and also their morphology . for @xmath36 , optimizing @xmath23 favors large communities , while for @xmath37 small communities dominate . to select the optimal value of @xmath25",

    "we found that the technique used by @xcite for 2d packings was ineffective in 3d systems .",
