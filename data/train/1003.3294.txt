    "it is known for noble metals with group 11 in the periodic table that gold has considerably different chemical stability from that of silver , although their fermi surface topology  @xcite and predicted band dispersion near the fermi level ( @xmath0 ) are mutually similar  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is well known that solid gold is very stable under many circumstances while solid silver is gradually oxidized in air .",
    "the valence - band electronic configurations of these solids per atom have so far been recognized  @xcite to be composed of fully occupied @xmath1d states ( @xmath1d@xmath2 ) plus one conduction electron occupying an @xmath3sp state ( @xmath4 for silver and @xmath5 for gold ) although these configurations have not been experimentally verified to date . in this paper , however , we show that the 5d - orbital contribution to the conduction electrons is actually prominent in bulk gold while the above configuration is practically correct for bulk silver , by means of the linear polarization - dependent hard x - ray photoemission which we have very recently developed .",
    "these findings could be related to a well - known fact that gold is more stable than silver in air .",
    "there are few experimental techniques to probe the orbital contributions in the valence - band electronic states of solids .",
    "such spectroscopic technique as resonance photoemission  @xcite and surface - sensitive low - energy two - dimensional angle - resolved photoemission over wide emission angles  @xcite are not practical at all for bulk polycrystalline gold and silver to quantitatively clarify the itinerant s , p and d orbital contributions to the conduction electrons .",
    "rough information of the orbital contributions can be obtained from a comparison of angle - integrated valence - band photoemission spectra at considerably different excitation energies  @xcite such as @xmath61 and @xmath78 kev , for which the relative photoionization cross - sections depend on @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath8 dependence of the spectra is often seen also by the different bulk / surface contribution ratio due to the different photoelectron kinetic energies  @xcite , which prevents us to reliably estimate the orbital contributions .    at hard x - ray excitations , the photoelectron cross - sections for the s and p states per an",
    "electron become comparable to those for the d and f states whereas they are very small at soft x - ray excitations  @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for gold and silver .",
    "moreover , it has been predicted theoretically that the photoelectron angular distribution with respect to the angle @xmath9 between the two directions of photoelectron detection and the linear polarization ( electric field ) of incident light has strong orbital dependence . as an overall tendency",
    ", the calculation  @xcite predicts that a ratio of the photoelectron intensity toward the direction perpendicular to the polarization vector ( @xmath10 ) to that along the polarization vector ( @xmath11 ) , defined as @xmath12 , is very small as @xmath130.1 for the s and @xmath14p ( @xmath15 ) states compared with that ( @xmath16 0.2 ) for the d and f states at @xmath8 = 5 - 10 kev .",
    "when we measure the hard x - ray valence - band photoemission  @xcite spectra with different linear polarization , a photoelectron intensity ratio @xmath17 ( hereafter simply called  ratio \" ) practically equivalent to @xmath12 ( @xmath18 should be much deviated from 90@xmath19 as in our present experimental geometry with 30@xmath19 , see the inset of figure  [ aucore ] ) can be obtained .",
    "therefore , the extraction of the s and @xmath14p contributions as well as that of the d and f contributions in the bulk valence band , for which there has been no conclusive experimental technique to date as mentioned above , become feasible by the linear polarization - dependent hard x - ray photoemission measurements .",
    "polarization - dependent hard x - ray photoemission measurement was performed at bl19lxu of spring-8  @xcite with a 27-m long undulator by using a newly developed mbs a1-he hemispherical photoelectron spectrometer .",
    "a si 111 double - crystal monochromator selected @xmath78 kev radiation with linear polarization along the horizontal direction ( the so - called degree of linear polarization @xmath20 ) , which was further monochromatized by a channel - cut crystal with the si 444 reflection . in order to switch the linear polarization of the hard x - ray from the horizontal to vertical directions ,",
    "a ( 100 ) diamond was used as a phase retarder  @xcite in the laue geometry with the 220 reflection , which was placed downstream of the channel - cut crystal .",
    "the transmittance of the x - ray at @xmath78 kev for the diamond was confirmed as @xmath735% .",
    "@xmath21 of the x - ray downstream from the phase retarder was estimated as about @xmath22 , which corresponds to the linear polarization components along the horizontal and vertical directions of 10% and 90% , respectively .",
    "as shown in the inset of figure  [ aucore ] , the emission direction of photoelectron to be detected was set within the horizontal plane , where @xmath9 between the light polarization and the electron emission angle was 30@xmath19 ( 90@xmath19 ) at the excitation with the horizontally ( vertically ) linear polarization .",

    "there is a strong spectral weight between 4 and 7 ev in both spectra at @xmath9 = 30@xmath19 and 90@xmath19 , which is predominantly ascribed to the 4d contributions .",
    "whereas this feature is consistent with the previous photoemission studies  @xcite , it is found that the experimentally estimated @xmath24 in this energy region is consistent with the calculated ratio for the 4d excitations as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ agval](a ) .",
    "the experimental ratio decreases rapidly from @xmath74 to @xmath73 ev and then stays almost flat toward @xmath0 , indicating that the spectral weight near @xmath0 is strongly suppressed at @xmath9 = 90@xmath19 compared with that of the 4d states in the region of @xmath27 ev .",

    "these results reveal that the 4d bands are located far below @xmath0 and well separated from the conduction 5sp band in an energy region from @xmath0 to @xmath73 ev .",
    "it is thus experimentally confirmed that the 4d orbitals are nearly fully occupied in the solid silver as expected for a long time , which has not been unfortunately verified by the previous high - energy photoemission  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of @xmath24 around 6.5 ev compared to that at 4.5 ev is mainly due to the mixture of the 5s state , which has been suggested by the previous band - structure calculations  @xcite as well as our band - structure calculation .",
    "we next show that the polarization dependence of the valence - band spectra for bulk gold is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different from that for silver , as demonstrated in figure  [ auval ] .",

    "the different slope of the intensity for different @xmath9 suggests that the 5d - orbital contribution is extended into the region of @xmath28 ev and the additive 6sp - orbital components contribute in the spectrum at @xmath9 = 30@xmath19 .",

    "as shown in figure  [ auval ] , the spectrum at @xmath9 = 90@xmath19 is excellently reproduced by the d pdos whereas a naive sum of the s , p and d pdos well simulates the spectrum at @xmath9 = 30@xmath19 .",
    "from a detailed analysis by comparison of the spectrum at @xmath9 = 30@xmath19 with the results of the band - structure calculation , we have estimated the 5d weight to the total density of state at @xmath0 as 40 - 60% .",

    "it should be noted that we do not need to use any information obtained from the band - structure calculation for this analysis .",
    "we have successfully estimated the 5d contribution in gold as @xmath29% from the analysis of @xmath24 while the precise estimation is rather difficult because of possible deviations of the actual intensity ratios and cross - sections from the calculated values .",
    "the mutually consistent results from these two independent analyses undoubtedly indicate the prominent 5d contribution to the joint density of states in the energy range of @xmath302 ev in gold .",
    "the fermi surface topology of the noble metals , which reflects a nature of the conduction electrons , is partially deviated from that expected for free electrons in crystalline solids  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown theoretically to be resulting from the hybridization of the @xmath3sp band with the @xmath1d bands  @xcite .",
    "it has also been predicted that the d - sp hybridization near @xmath0 is quantitatively stronger for gold than for silver due to different energy and different degree of itinerancy between the 5d and 4d bands .",
    "indeed , the experimentally observed threshold of the  @xmath1d bands \" by our and previous  @xcite experiments is closer to @xmath0 for gold ( @xmath72 ev ) than for silver ( @xmath74 ev ) as shown in figures  [ agval ]  and  [ auval ] .",
    "the strong itinerancy and d - sp hybridization for the 5d orbitals in gold are due to the relativistic effects as discussed for the long time  @xcite .",
    "our findings , the prominent 5d contribution to the conduction electrons in gold and essentially negligible 4d mixture for silver , are understood as the results of the markedly different strength of d - sp mixing near @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that such a qualitative difference of the d mixture in the conduction band crossing @xmath0 has not been predicted from the band - structure calculations , in which additional electron correlation effects are not taken into account .",
    "the stability or reactivity of solids in air has directly been discussed in terms of kinetic , thermodynamic and surface properties etc . by using a born - haber cycle , which are determined by such fundamental physical properties as crystal structure , lattice parameter , the nominal number of valence and conduction electrons , electronic dispersion near @xmath0 , fermi surface topology and orbital symmetry of conduction electrons . on the other hand , the reactivity of the noble metals can also be discussed from a viewpoint of the electronic structure as seen in ref .  .",
    "our results experimentally reveal one of few decisive differences in such properties as mentioned above between gold and silver .",
    "namely , the conduction electrons in silver with the predominant 5sp character are more free - electron - like than those in gold , in which the 5d character is strongly mixed .",
    "this different orbital contribution to the conduction electrons could be related to the different stability in air between gold and silver .",
    "in addition to our results , it is known that platinum with fcc structure and nominal 5d@xmath316sp@xmath32 configuration is also very stable in air , for which a whole valence - band dispersions are predicted to be almost the same as those for gold except for the position of @xmath0 and therefore the 5d contribution to the conduction electrons is undoubtedly predominant  @xcite .",
    "considering this fact and our results , we can conclude that the prominent 5d contribution to the conduction electrons has a role to protect gold from the oxidation in air in addition to the preceding discussion  @xcite , where the 5d orbitals are thought to be partially bound to the nucleus sites but considerably itinerant due to the relativistic effects .",
    "if the 5d contribution were negligible , gold would tend to be gradually oxidized in air as silver does .",
    "we note that a similar discussion of reactivity in terms of the d mixing in the conduction electrons is not applicable for copper even if the 3d contribution would be experimentally verified since the character of the 3d orbital is quite different from that of the 5d orbital .",
    "indeed , both nickel ( nominally 3d@xmath334sp@xmath34 or 3d@xmath314sp@xmath32 ) and zinc ( nominally 3d@xmath24sp@xmath34 ) are not very stable in air .",
    "we refer to possible other effects of the prominent 5d contribution to the conduction electrons in gold . our result has revealed the presence of the intrinsic 5d holes in gold , which have previously been proposed from the results of the band - structure calculations  @xcite and the l@xmath35-edge x - ray absorption  @xcite although these studies have not given clear evidence of the 5d holes .",
    "[ it should be noted that the 2p-6s and/or 2p-@xmath36d ( @xmath37 ) transitions also take place in addition to the 2p-5d transition in the l@xmath35-edge absorption . ]",
    "it is expected that there are 5d holes even in recently investigaed gold nanoparticles showing magnetism  @xcite due to the strong d - sp hybridization .",
    "the 5d holes will increase if the conduction electrons are transferred from the nanoparticles to neighbouring molecules as discussed in reference  . in such a situation ,",
    "it is natural to consider a role of the 5d holes for the magnetism in the gold nanoparticles although our result does not give direct evidence of the 5d magnetism .",

    "the cross - sections and angular distributions at @xmath68 kev  @xcite are taken into account . , width=302 ]    the band - structure calculations , in which all the valence - band electrons are treated as itinerant ones , basically give the results of conduction electrons with noticeable d - sp mixing for silver and gold .",
    "such a calculated result well explain the experimental spectra of gold",
    ". for silver , the experimental 4d contribution in the spectra near @xmath0 is much less than that from the calculation .",
    "this deviation can be understood by considering the finite 4d electron correlation effects in silver .",
    "it is naturally expected that the correlated orbital contribution to the conduction electrons is suppressed due to the localization when the on - site coulomb interactions are switched on , as seen for many rare - earth compounds . in order to verify whether the above scenario is correct for silver or not , we have also performed the lda+@xmath38-like  @xcite calculation by using the linear muffin - tin orbital method  @xcite , in which the on - site coulomb interaction value @xmath38 = 3.5 ev is applied to the 4d orbitals .",
    "figure  [ agcompare ] shows the comparison of the ratio @xmath24 for silver with the predicted ratios from the calculations .",
    "one can notice that the lda+@xmath38 results better explain the experimental ratio near @xmath0 as well as in a wide valence - band region than the lda calculation .",
    "we thus conclude that the 4d electron correlation effects are responsible for its negligible contribution to the conduction electrons in silver .",
    "in conclusions , we have performed the polarization - dependent hard x - ray photoemission for gold and silver , from which the prominent 5d and negligible 4d contributions to the conduction electrons in gold and silver have been revealed .",

    "we have calculated the ratio at the photoelectron kinetic energies of 1 , 3 , 5 and 10 kev and then obtained the above value at 8 kev by the interpolation since there are no calculation parameters for the 8-kev photoelectrons . as shown in figure  [ auval ] ( a ) , the calculated value for the 5d@xmath26 excitation is very close to the experimentally estimated ratio at the binding energy of 2 - 5 ev , which corresponds to the 5d - band region .",
