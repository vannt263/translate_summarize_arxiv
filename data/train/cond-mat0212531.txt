    "in the mixed phase of type - ii superconductors , magnetic flux penetrates the sample in the form of quantized vortex lines  @xcite .",
    "the amount of flux carried by each vortex line is equal to the basic flux quantum @xmath1g.@xmath2 .",
    "these vortex lines form a special physical system known as `` vortex matter '' . in the absence of any pinning sites in the material , the vortex lines form a triangular lattice known as the abrikosov lattice  @xcite .",
    "equilibrium and transport properties of the mixed phase of type - ii superconductors are strongly affected by the presence of pinning centers , either intrinsic to the system or artificially generated .",
    "understanding the effects of pinning in these systems is very important for practical applications because the presence of pinning strongly influences the value of the critical current in the mixed phase .    in recent years",
    ", a variety of nanofabrication techniques have been used to create periodic arrays of pinning centers in thin - film superconductors  @xcite .",
    "such arrays may consist of microholes ( `` antidots '' )  @xcite , defects produced by the bombardment of ion  @xcite or electron  @xcite beams , or magnetic dots  @xcite .",
    "these pinning centers are `` strong '' in the sense that each pinning site can trap one or more vortices at low temperatures .",
    "the effects of periodic pinning depend strongly on the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the areal density of the pinning centers ) is the so - called `` matching field '' , and @xmath4 is the magnetic induction that determines the areal density @xmath7 of vortices ( @xmath8 ) . the filling ratio , @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 , measures the commensurability of the vortex system with the underlying pin lattice .",
    "the interplay between the lattice constant of the pin array ( determined by @xmath3 ) and the intervortex separation ( determined by @xmath4 ) can lead to a variety of interesting effects in such systems .",
    "some of these effects have been observed in recent experiments .",
    "imaging experiments using various techniques such as lorentz microscopy  @xcite and scanning hall probe microscopy  @xcite have shown the formation of ordered structures of the vortex system at low temperatures for commensurate values of @xmath9 .",
    "magnetization measurements  @xcite in the irreversible ( vortex solid ) regime have demonstrated the occurrence of anomalies at certain harmonics of @xmath3 .",
    "the effectiveness of pinning at integral values of @xmath9 has been found  @xcite to produce regularly spaced sharp minima in the resistivity versus field curve .",
    "a pinning - induced reconfiguration of the vortex lattice has been observed  @xcite in a thin - film superconductor with a rectangular array of magnetic dots .",
    "some of these effects have been studied theoretically , using analytic  @xcite and numerical  @xcite methods .",
    "experimental realizations of a system of interacting `` particles '' in the presence of an external periodic potential are also obtained in colloidal suspensions in interfering laser fields  @xcite , and in periodic arrays of optical traps  @xcite .    in this paper , we have used analytic and numerical methods to analyze the zero - temperature structure of vortex arrays in the presence of periodic pinning .",
    "we have also carried out a numerical study of the zero - temperature _ equilibrium _ magnetization of a superconducting film with a square array of pinning centers as a function of the applied field . in section  [ nlt1 ]",
    ", we consider the ground states of a vortex system in a square array of pinning centers for fillings less than unity .",
    "we look at a class of structures that are bravais lattices with one vortex per basis if the filling @xmath9 is of the form @xmath11 , and with @xmath12 vortices per basis if @xmath13 ( @xmath12 and @xmath14 are integers greater than unity , with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the structure with the lowest energy in this class can be obtained rather easily .",
    "we find that the `` ground - state '' structure obtained this way matches those obtained from experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite for a large number of simple fractional values of @xmath9 .",
    "the results obtained in this section can also be used to predict the ground - state structures for @xmath16 . in section  [ ngt2 ] , we consider the ground - state structures for fillings greater than two . in these calculations ,",
    "we use simple geometric arguments to arrive at the ground states .",
    "this analysis is performed under the assumption that the range of the intervortex interaction , which is set by the penetration depth , is much smaller than the spacing between the pinning sites .",
    "we show that the ground - state structures obtained from this simple analysis match the ones obtained from simulated annealing .",
    "this analysis is extended to rectangular and triangular pin lattices in section  [ rect ] . in section  [ mag ] , the zero - temperature equilibrium magnetization of a vortex system in a square array of pinning centers is obtained by first calculating the ground - state energy as a function of the magnetic induction and then finding the applied field from a numerical differentiation of the data .",
    "the ground - state energies for different values of the magnetic induction are obtained using a simulated annealing procedure .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 curve exhibits interesting commensurability effects , manifested as plateaus occurring at simple rational values of the filling fraction @xmath9 .",
    "the main results of our study are summarized in section  [ summ ] .",
    "we consider a superconducting film that has a square array of pinning sites with lattice constant @xmath17 .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be perpendicular to the surface of the film .",
    "the `` matching field '' @xmath18 is then given by @xmath19 , and the filling fraction @xmath9 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath4 is the magnetic induction .",
    "we assume that the pinning potential is much stronger than the intervortex interaction , but is of extremely short range . the large strength of the pinning potential implies that the vortices must occupy pinning sites as long as the number of vortices does not exceed the number of pinning sites .",
    "we also assume that a pinning site can not accommodate more than one vortex .",
    "if the pinning centers in the film are microholes , then this assumption amounts to the requirement that the radius of each hole is close to two times the coherence length @xmath21 of the superconductor .",
    "these assumptions ensure that interstitial vortices appear only when the filling fraction @xmath9 is greater than unity .",
    "the assumed short range of the pinning potential can be justified if the defect diameter is small compared to the defect spacing @xmath17 .",
    "another assumption that we will make in most of our calculations is that the intervortex interaction falls off rapidly with distance .",
    "this is ensured if the penetration depth @xmath22 is much smaller that the pin - lattice spacing @xmath17 . in our calculations , we take the ratio @xmath23 to be @xmath24 . this value is appropriate for the pin lattice of ref .. we consider temperatures that are low enough to neglect effects of depinning and vortex - lattice melting .",
    "the problem of finding the structure of the vortex system then reduces to locating the ground state in the presence of the pinning potential .",
    "consider now fillings of the form @xmath25 , @xmath14 being an integer greater than one .",
    "let us look at bravais lattices that can be formed for a specific @xmath9 by distributing the vortices on the square pin lattice with one vortex per basis .",
    "the motivation for considering such lattices is that this will automatically ensure that there is no shear of the vortices with respect to the pin lattice , since the forces on a vortex due to other vortices will add up exactly to zero .",
    "the unit cell area of these structures has to be @xmath26 .",
    "so the possible unit cells can be obtained by factorizing @xmath14 into products of the form @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are integers ) , arranging the vortices at the corners of rectangles of dimension @xmath30 , and then sliding the parallel sides relative to each other .",
    "this procedure produces a large number of structures depending on the value of @xmath9 and we have to pick the one that minimizes the energy . for small values of @xmath14 ,",
    "this can be done by hand , but as @xmath14 becomes large and highly factorizable , the number of possible structures increases rapidly . in such cases ,",
    "we have resorted to computers to generate these structures and compare their energies .",
    "the structures so obtained for fillings @xmath31 and @xmath32 match those found in the imaging experiment  @xcite . also for fillings @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we find the same structures as those obtained by solving the `` greedy lattice gas model ''  @xcite exactly .",
    "this is understandable because when the intervortex interaction falls off rapidly as the distance is increased above the defect spacing @xmath17 , the ground state can be attained by finding the lattice that _ maximizes the shortest distance between vortex pairs_. if two structures have same value and number of shortest distances , then the next shortest distance should be maximized , and so on . for fillings",
    "@xmath35 , and @xmath36 , our analysis also yields the same structures as those found in the large @xmath37 ( @xmath37 is the energy of on - site repulsion between two electrons ) limit of the neutral falicov - kimball model  @xcite . in fig .",
    "1(a , b , c ) , we have shown the structures so obtained for a few fillings of the form @xmath38 .",
    "the ground - state structure shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) for @xmath39 is different from that found in ref . from a simulated annealing calculation .",
    "this difference is probably due to the use of a different ( logarithmic ) intervortex potential in ref ..    let us now compare the energies of the nearest and next - nearest neighbors in one of these lattices .",
    "the interaction energy between two vortices separated by a distance @xmath28 is given by the expression , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the zeroth order hankel function of imaginary argument and @xmath42 is the film thickness . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the nearest neighbor distance is @xmath44 and the next - nearest neighbor distance is @xmath45 .",
    "so the interaction energies are , to within a constant prefactor , given by @xmath46{2}d}{\\lambda}\\right )     =   0.2 \\times 10^{-6 } , \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath47 one can see here that there is orders of magnitude difference in these energies which can not be compensated by differences arising from interactions with more distant neighbors .",
    "this difference is going to be more prominent at lower densities .",
    "this tells us that the maximization of the shortest intervortex distance    in a lattice for a given filling would lead to the ground states , provided the lattice spacing is large compared to the penetration depth of the film .",
    "this , in fact , is exactly the definition of the greedy lattice gas .",
    "however , one has to be cautious about this method because , as noted in ref .",
    ", the structures can be strongly dependent on the form of the potential in certain ranges of @xmath9 and we can even have aperiodic structures as ground states .",
    "the ground - state structures shown here have been cross checked with simulations to ensure that they are indeed the lowest energy configurations .",
    "to give an example of a case where this treatment does not lead to the true ground state , we found that for filling @xmath48 , the energy per vortex for the structure with minimum energy obtained this way was greater than that for filling @xmath34 , implying that the structure obtained for @xmath49 was not the ground state .",
    "when the filling fraction is of the form @xmath50 with @xmath12 not equal to one , one can look for ground states in a subset of structures where the unit cell has size @xmath51 with @xmath12 vortices in a basis .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "1(d , e , f ) some of the ground - state structures obtained this way .",
    "these structures match those obtained from our simulated annealing calculation .",
    "these ground states show the `` stripe '' structure predicted by watson  @xcite and kennedy  @xcite in appropriate density ranges .",
    "if @xmath9 is greater that @xmath52 but smaller than @xmath53 , then the ground - state structures are similar to the ones for the case of @xmath9 less than one .",
    "the only difference is that the pinning sites are all occupied and the centers of the square unit cells of the pin lattice now act as new pinning centers for interstitial vortices . but things look different when the filling goes above the value @xmath54 . for such values of @xmath9",
    ", we can no longer place the interstitial vortices at the centers of the squares and look for simple structures obtained this way .",
    "also , we now have to start looking into the stability of the structures since the square symmetry would not be present .      here",
    "we are faced with the task of placing more than one vortex in a square . before going to the problem of finding the ground state for @xmath55 ,",
    "let us ask a more basic question : given a single unit cell of the square pin lattice with each corner occupied by a vortex .",
    "how can we arrange two more vortices inside this square so as to minimize the energy . since `` greedy lattice gas '' has been a good approximation for the previous cases , we try to tackle this problem by `` maximizing the shortest distance '' method . in order to stabilize an interstitial vortex by maximizing the shortest distance ,",
    "its distance from at least three nearest vortices must be the shortest distance .",
    "it is also required that these nearest set of vortices must be spread in such a way that if we draw straight lines from the vortex in question to these neighbors , the angles formed by adjacent lines must be less than @xmath56 .",
    "the proof of this statement is given in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "it can be seen from the symmetry of the problem that we have to place the two vortices on the lines joining the centers of the sides to meet the condition mentioned above .",
    "this leaves us with only two possible ways of doing it , which are shown in fig .",
    "= 4.2 cm    in ( a ) the shortest distance @xmath57 can be obtained by solving the equation @xmath58 on solving this equation , we get @xmath59{7 }   - 1)d/3 $ ] . in ( b ) the vortices",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 form an equilateral triangle .",
    "thus the nearest neighbor distance @xmath62 is @xmath63 the angle @xmath64 in ( a ) is @xmath65 , and the angle @xmath66 in ( b ) is @xmath67 .",
    "the interaction energies corresponding to these two distances for @xmath68 are @xmath69{7}-1}{3\\lambda}d\\right )    \\simeq 2.2 \\times 10^{-3 } \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath70 from comparing these two energies it is clear that ( a ) is the global minimum , whereas configuration ( b ) can at best be a local minimum .    coming back to the @xmath55 case , we now have to build up the lattice with equal number of two types of squares - one with two interstitial vortices and the other with one interstitial vortex .",
    "note that here we have neglected structures that have three or more interstitial vortices inside a square unit cell because such structures would drastically bring down the nearest neighbor distance .",
    "let us now look at the possible units cells of size @xmath71 that can be made out of these two types of squares .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "if one constructs the lattice with these unit cells , configuration ( b ) offers the least number of next - nearest neighbors , the number of nearest neighbors being the same in all the cases .",
    "so one can expect ( b ) to be the ground state unit cell , at least for large values of @xmath72",
    ". however , unit cell ( a ) is preferred if @xmath72 is not very large .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : the advantage that ( b ) has over ( a ) is that it has only half the number of next - nearest neighbors ( interactions like that between vortices @xmath73 and @xmath9 ) compared to ( a ) .",
    "but this is done at the cost of bringing in interactions like those between vortex pairs ( @xmath74 ) and ( @xmath75 ) for every `` gain '' of a next - nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the energies of these two interactions for @xmath68 are found to be quite close .",
    "these energies are @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the distances between vortices @xmath73 and @xmath9 , and @xmath12 and @xmath14 in fig.3 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from this comparison that the unit cell ( a ) would be preferred for @xmath68 .",
    "the ratio of interaction energies of the next - nearest and the nearest neighbors is 0.07 for this lattice when @xmath68 .",
    "this energy difference is appreciable here , so that we can expect that the unit cell we arrived at is the correct one .",
    "note that any net force that might be present on one of the interstitial vortices due to the asymmetry in the structure can be compensated by extremely small displacements from the positions obtained from the `` maximization of the shortest distance '' method .",
    "when the filling fraction equals @xmath81 , we have to build up the lattice using blocks of type ( a ) in fig 2 . again , looking at unit cells of size @xmath71 or smaller , we have the configurations shown in fig . 4 to consider .    here",
    "it is easy to see that unit cell ( b ) is preferred over the others .",
    "this is because it is the configuration that maximizes the minimum distance between any two vortices in different squares , the distances between vortices within one square being the same in all the configurations .",
    "again comparing the nearest interaction and the next - nearest one , we have @xmath82 @xmath83 there is appreciable difference between these two values , and hence , the ground state we have arrived at is reasonable .",
    "when the filling lies between @xmath53 and @xmath81 , one can safely assume that the ground state structure can be built up using squares of type ( a ) in fig . 2 , and squares that have one vortex at the center .",
    "in fact we make use of this in our simulations to arrive at the ground states , as described in section  [ mag ] .      here",
    "we have to place three interstitial vortices in one square .",
    "this is nontrivial since even if we ensure that the shortest distance is maximized in one square , two vortices in nearby squares may be closer to each other than the shortest distance within a square when we create the lattice .",
    "note that we did not come across this problem in the @xmath55 or @xmath80 fillings .",
    "to illustrate this problem , we show in fig .",
    "5(a ) a single cell of a square lattice with three interstitial vortices , which may very well be a local minimum configuration .",
    "= 4.2 cm    but if we try to build the lattice using this cell , we can not do it without bringing the vortices in nearby squares closer than the minimum distance in an individual cell .",
    "so what we need to do is to look for a pattern that will include vortices in different squares while doing the minimization of the shortest distance .",
    "we can solve this problem trigonometrically .",
    "consider the figure shown in fig .",
    "the solution we are looking for can be obtained by solving the equations @xmath85 @xmath86 note that here we have assumed a unit cell size @xmath87 .",
    "on solving these equations , we obtain the unit cell shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) . in the figure",
    ", the angle @xmath66 equals @xmath67 and the angle @xmath88 is @xmath89 . in this lattice ,",
    "the shortest distance is @xmath90 and the next shortest distance is @xmath91",
    ".    this simple solution may not be the correct one if the lattice spacing is not large enough .",
    "for example , if @xmath68 , as we have been assuming when comparing energies , then the nearest and next - nearest neighbor interaction energies turn out to be really close . hence we can not rule out the possibility of the lattice arranging in such a way that the shortest distance is reduced so as to decrease the number of nearest or next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the relevant energies for @xmath68 are @xmath92 so the ground state obtained above is guaranteed to be the correct one only for much larger values of @xmath72 .",
    "the ground states we have obtained for @xmath55 and @xmath80 match with the images from experiments  @xcite and also the results of simulations  @xcite . but for @xmath84 , the structures found in experiments and simulations are different from the one shown in figs 5(b ) and 6 .",
    "this is expected , since in the experiment the value of the ratio @xmath72 was close to ten .",
    "our simulation with @xmath93 gives the ground - state structure show in fig .",
    "7 ( a ) , which is similar to the one obtained in the experiment  @xcite . in our simulations with very large values of @xmath72 , we get structures similar to that in fig .",
    "the simulation result for @xmath94 is shown in fig . 7 ( b ) , which matches well with the predicted structure .",
    "it is to be noted that the simulation result was obtained by starting the system near the expected ground state .",
    "so the claim is that it offers at least a local minimum of the interaction energy .",
    "the simulations were carried out for different system sizes form @xmath71 to @xmath95 to rule out any dependence of the results on the boundary condition .",
    "one can extend this type of analysis to pinning arrays with other symmetries for finding the least energy structures for simple filling fractions .",
    "let us first consider the case of a rectangular array of pinning sites with a pinning unit cell of dimensions @xmath96 , where we take @xmath97 to be the longer side of the rectangle .",
    "we shall consider here only the cases where the filling is greater than one . in the absence of the square symmetry , it is obvious that the ground state structure will depend not only on the penetration depth @xmath22 , but also on the ratio @xmath98 . in the following analysis , we shall always assume that @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath99 , the shorter side of the basic rectangular pinning cell . when the filling is @xmath53 , for values of @xmath98 less than @xmath100 , the ground state is one where each interstitial vortex is at the center of the rectangle , since this ensures that the shortest distance is maximized ( see fig .",
    "8(b ) ) .",
    "= 3.5 cm    but when the aspect ratio exceeds @xmath100 and the interstitial vortices are placed at the centers of the rectangles , the distance between two interstitial vortices in neighboring cells would be shorter than that between an interstitial vortex and the closest pinned vortex .",
    "this would lead to a displacement of the interstitial vortices sideways from the center , along the bisector of the shorter sides of the rectangle , to maximize the shortest distance .",
    "the resulting structure is shown in fig . 8 ( a ) .",
    "the displacement of the vortex from the center is given by    @xmath101    it is worth noting that since the vortex in the center would be moving towards two of the pinned vortices , and away from only one interstitial vortex per unit cell , the displacement will approach the value given above only when the ratio @xmath98 is appreciably large and in the limit of small penetration depth compared to the sides of the rectangle .",
    "for example we have found in our simulations that even when the ratio @xmath98 is @xmath53 , the ground state for @xmath102 is one where the interstitial vortex is very close to the center , whereas for the @xmath103 and @xmath102 , the ground - state structure is quite close to the one obtained from maximizing the shortest distance .",
    "some of our simulation results for filling equal to two are shown in fig .",
    "12 ( a , b ) .",
    "also , if the ratio @xmath98 becomes too large , the analysis will have to include more than two of the interstitial vortices , since now the solution like that shown in fig .",
    "8 ( a ) can lead to two vortices being closer in the next nearest cells or ones even further apart .    in trying to arrive at the lowest energy structures for fillings @xmath104 and @xmath81 , it is important to determine how one can accommodate two vortices in a rectangular cell with the shortest distance being maximized .",
    "there are two possible minima that one has to consider : one where the vortices are arranged along the line dividing the shorter sides , and one where they are arranged along the line dividing the longer sides , as shown in figs 9 ( a ) and 9 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the shortest distance in each case is given by , @xmath105    = 3.5 cm    if one considers the distances within the cell , configuration ( b ) in fig .",
    "9 gives the lowest energy .",
    "but for large values of the ratio @xmath98 , this configuration is disfavored since it allows the vortices in one rectangle to get close to those in a neighboring one . also , for @xmath106 , the interstitial vortices `` spill over '' into the next cell , since the distance @xmath107 becomes greater than @xmath99 .",
    "so , one has to work out the structures for fillings @xmath104 and @xmath81 case by case . for fillings between @xmath53 and @xmath81 ,",
    "one has to choose appropriate number of two - vortex rectangles of the right kind and single - vortex ones and arrange them so as to maximize the shortest distance appearing in the structure .",
    "we have looked at the @xmath108 unit cells possible for filling @xmath104 for two values of the aspect ratio , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the unit cells that provide the largest minimum distance are shown in fig . 10 . note that when    @xmath111 , the vortices are arranged parallel to the longer side and in the other case , parallel to the shorter side . also when @xmath112 , the vortex in the single - vortex rectangular cell is not located at the center , but slightly displaced sideways along the bisector of the shorter sides to facilitate the maximization of the second shortest distance involved .",
    "one should again keep in mind that this sort of analysis will go wrong if the aspect ratio is too large , since then the distances between vortices in next - nearest or further neighbor cells will become important . in fig .",
    "12 ( c ) we have shown the ground state structure obtained from simulations for aspect ratio @xmath113 , with @xmath114 and in fig .",
    "12 ( d ) , the ground state for aspect ratio @xmath115 , with @xmath116 . in fig",
    ". 12 ( d ) , one can notice the slight shift of the vortex from the center in rectangular units having a single interstitial vortex .",
    "the shift is not as large as expected from the above analysis .",
    "this is due to the large but finite value of @xmath117 .    for filling equal to @xmath81 ,",
    "the lowest energy structures obtained by considering @xmath108 unit cells for two values of the aspect ratio , @xmath53 and @xmath115 , are shown in fig .",
    "11 . here too , for large values of the aspect ratio , the structure is composed of rectangular cells where the interstitial vortices are aligned parallel to the longer side ( fig .",
    "11(a ) ) , whereas when the aspect ratio is smaller , the structure is made up of an alternating arrangement of rectangular cells of both types ( fig .",
    "the simulated annealing results for similar values of the aspect ratio ( fig . 12 ( e , f ) ) yield the structures obtained from the above analysis .",
    "ground state structures obtained by simulated annealing for a rectangular pin array with @xmath118 and integral values of @xmath9 are reported in ref .. in that study , the intervortex interaction was assumed to depend logarithmically on the intervortex distance .",
    "the ground state structure found in ref .",
    "for @xmath119 is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "12(b ) , but the structure found there for @xmath120 is quite different from those of fig .",
    "12(e , f ) .",
    "this is another example of the importance of the detailed nature of the intervortex interaction in determining the structure of the ground state .",
    "= 7.5 cm    for a triangular array of pinning sites , it is easy to see that when the filling is greater than @xmath52 and less than 3 , the interstitial vortices will be placed on the centroids of the triangles in the limit where one can safely apply the method of maximization of the shortest distance .",
    "so the ground states when @xmath9 is between @xmath52 and @xmath81 will be made up of parallelogram cells of the form shown in fig .",
    "these unit cells match well with the results of molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe a calculation of the zero - temperature , equilibrium magnetization of a thin - film superconductor in the presence of a square array of pinning sites .",
    "the region in the @xmath0 plain we are interested in is that just above @xmath121 , when the flux tubes start entering the sample .",
    "the idea is to find the free energy @xmath122 of the ground state as a function of the magnetic induction @xmath4 , and then to obtain the applied magnetic field @xmath123 by taking a derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "since we are considering the zero - temperature case , the free energy is just the internal energy of the flux lattice .",
    "since we are looking for a nearly continuous variation of the internal energy for taking the derivative , we need to locate the ground states for filling fractions separated by small intervals",
    ". this would be difficult to do analytically , since the unit cells for some filling fractions can be arbitrarily large . also , as @xmath9 becomes large , the simple procedure of maximization of the shortest distance is not going to yield the correct ground - state structures .",
    "so we have resorted to simulations to determine the ground states . in particular , we have used the simulated annealing technique to locate the global minima ( or at least low - lying local minima close in energy to the global ones ) of the part of the internal energy associated with intervortex interactions .",
    "the helmholtz free energy per unit volume of the superconductor at zero temperature in the presence of the pinning sites is @xmath124 where the first term is the line energy , the second term is the interaction energy and the third term is the pinning energy . here",
    ", @xmath125 is the line energy per unit length , @xmath126 is the pinning energy per unit length and @xmath127 is the interaction energy per unit volume for filling fraction @xmath9 .",
    "we note here that the pinning energy increases linearly with @xmath9 till @xmath9 becomes one and then remains constant , since multiple occupation of a pinning center is not allowed .",
    "further , for simplicity , we express the pinning energy as @xmath128 where @xmath73 is a positive number whose magnitude depends on the nature of pinning . the interaction part of the free energy , @xmath127 , is the computational input .",
    "once we know the free energy , we can compute the applied magnetic field @xmath123 using the relation @xmath129 using the standard expression  @xcite for @xmath125 and taking the logarithm of the ginzburg - landau number to be equal to 2 , we get the following expression for the applied field as a function of the filling fraction : @xmath130 +   \\frac{\\partial e_{n}^\\prime}{\\partial n}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath131 is given by the expression @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the number of basic pinning squares in the system and @xmath134 is the separation between vortices @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the ground state for the filling fraction @xmath9 .",
    "the size of the systems we simulated varies from @xmath137 to @xmath138 . in all cases , we used periodic boundary conditions to minimize surface effects .",
    "so the minimum difference between two consecutive filling fractions was @xmath139 .",
    "the ratio @xmath72 was taken to be @xmath24 , as in our previous analysis . in order to save computation time",
    ", the vortices were allowed to stay only at the pinning sites when the filling was less than one . for fillings between one and two ,",
    "every pinning site was occupied by a vortex which was never moved and the extra ones were allowed to move near the centers of the basic pinning squares . when the filling was greater that two and less than three , the vortex configurations were constructed using basic units of squares containing one vortex at its center and squares containing two vortices placed such that the shortest distance within a square is maximized ( as in fig .",
    "these units were then moved around and twisted while cooling to arrive at the minimum energy states .",
    "this procedure helped us to track low - lying minima faster than if we allowed vortices to move freely .",
    "once the basic structure was thus obtained , the vortices were allowed to move freely during a second cooling schedule starting from a lower temperature to obtain the lowest - energy structure . in fig .",
    "14 we have shown some of the ground state structures we have obtained this way for fillings between @xmath53 and @xmath81 . for fillings",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath81 , we find that the structures match those obtained in experiments @xcite , as well as in our analysis using maximization of the shortest distance .",
    "the structures for @xmath140 and @xmath141 may not be the actual ground states , either due to the smallness of the unit cell of our simulation or due to the presence of many nearly degenerate local minima .",
    "= 5.5 cm    in fig .",
    "15 we have plotted the ground state energies obtained from the simulation for different fillings .",
    "the simulation unit cell was @xmath142 and the energies were computed for fillings @xmath143 to @xmath81 . the upper curve shows the results obtained in the presence of the pinning sites and the lower curve is the energy of the triangular lattice for the same density of vortices .",
    "note that we have not included the pinning energy in the plot .",
    "this would bring down the upper curve below the curve for the pin - free case .",
    "= 5.5 cm    from the energy versus filling fraction data , one can find the applied field using eq.(11 ) and then compute the magnetization @xmath144 using the relation @xmath145 in fig .",
    "16 we have plotted @xmath4 versus @xmath123 in the entire range of filling for which simulations were carried out , from @xmath146 to @xmath120 .",
    "figs 17 and 18 show magnified versions of this plot in the regions between filling fractions @xmath147 and @xmath52 , and between @xmath53 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "note that we have not explicitly included the pinning energy term in our analysis .",
    "this term would just add a constant contribution to @xmath123 for fillings up to @xmath52 .",
    "the features of the curve from @xmath148 to @xmath54 are the same as those in the interval between @xmath149 to @xmath148 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ground state structures are similar in the two regions ( see section [ ngt2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 plot shows flat regions at values of @xmath4 corresponding to fillings @xmath150 ,",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath52 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath115 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath53 in the filling fraction range between @xmath147 and @xmath53 .",
    "also , in the range of @xmath9 between @xmath53 and @xmath81 , there are roughly two plateaus , appearing near @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "= 5.5 cm    the observed values of the filling fractions between @xmath146 and @xmath161 at which the plateaus occur indicate that these values of @xmath9 correspond to fillings where the introduction of a new vortex into the system leads to the appearance of a shorter distance than those existing in the lattice or in its dual ( i.e. the lattice obtained by replacing particles by holes , and vice versa )  @xcite .",
    "this makes sense because the introduction of this shorter distance brings in a larger energy scale , leading to a discontinuous change in the derivative of the energy with respect to the filling @xmath9 . in the simulations",
    ", we have not scanned very small intervals of @xmath9 .",
    "also , for some of the fillings , the ground state may not have been obtained in our simulated annealing calculation .",
    "for these reasons , we can not say anything definite about the true nature of the @xmath0 curve .",
    "it is possible that this curve has plateaus and discontinuities occurring at all scales ( e.g. at all rational values of @xmath9 ) .",
    "the noisy nature of the @xmath0 plot in the range where @xmath9 lies between @xmath53 and @xmath81 ( see fig . 18 ) is also due to these difficulties .",
    "however , this plot shows clear signatures of two plateaus that appear near @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "these can be understood as happening when first there is an occurrence of squares containing two vortices coming next to each other diagonally ( as in fig 3(a ) ) , and again when they have to be next to each other with a common side ( as in figs 3(b ) and 3(c ) ) , as the value of @xmath9 increases from @xmath53 to @xmath81 .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the results of an analytic calculation of the lowest - energy states of a vortex system in the presence of a periodic array of strong pinning centers , each of which can trap only one vortex .",
    "we have considered several different lattice structures of the pin array and a large number of filling fractions in the range between zero and four .",
    "the analytic calculations are based on the principle of maximization of the shortest intervortex distance .",
    "we have argued that this principle leads to the exact ground states when the spacing of the defect lattice is large compared to the range of the intervortex interaction set by the value of the penetration depth .",
    "this principle has been used , in combination with simple geometric considerations , to obtain the ground states for several values of the filling fraction @xmath9 .",
    "the ground - state structures so obtained are found to be identical to those found in imaging experiments  @xcite and in earlier simulations  @xcite .",
    "we have also carried out simulated annealing calculations of the ground states in order to test some of the predictions of the analytic approach . in all cases",
    ", we found that the analytic results agree with those of our numerical calculation .",
    "we have also described the results of a numerical calculation of the equilibrium magnetic induction @xmath4 and magnetization @xmath144 of a planar superconductor with a square array of pinning centers as functions of the externally applied field @xmath123 .",
    "we show that the interplay between the lattice spacing of the pin array and the intervortex separation set by the value of @xmath4 leads to interesting commensurability effects , showing up as plateaus and discontinuities in the @xmath4 vs @xmath123 plot at simple rational values of the filling fraction @xmath9 .",
    "anomalies in the _ irreversible _ magnetization of thin - film superconductors with periodic arrays of pinning centers have been observed at certain integral values of @xmath9 in experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a periodic array of pins is also expected  @xcite to produce anomalies in the equilibrium magnetization of the high - temperature vortex liquid at small integral values of @xmath9 .",
    "our results show that these commensurability effects are more pronounced in the field - dependence of the equilibrium magnetization and magnetic induction of such systems in the low - temperature vortex - solid regime .",
    "experimental investigations of these effects would be most welcome .",
    "given a particle fixed at some point in a plane , the problem is how to place three other particles around the first one in such a way that if we try to move the first particle from its position , it will get closer to at least one of the three particles .",
    "the solution is as follows .",
    "if we draw straight lines from the particle that we want to move to the other particles , then each angle between adjacent lines must be less than @xmath56 . in other words",
    ", it should not be possible to draw a straight line through the particle in question in such a way that all the other three particles lie on one side of the line .",
    "this can be done since one of the angles between any two lines will always be less than or equal to @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "19 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the tangents to the circles centered at @xmath163 and @xmath164 and passing through the point @xmath162 .",
    "the presence of these particles restricts to within the angle @xmath21 the direction in which the particle at @xmath162 can move without decreasing its distance to @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "now let us check where we can fix the third particle such that the aforementioned condition is met , that is the particle at @xmath162 can not be moved without bringing it closer to one of the particles at @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath169 .",
    "we will consider two possible cases - the third particle in the region @xmath170 of the plane and outside this region .",
    "when the third particle is in the region @xmath170 ( point @xmath169 in the figure ) , it is not possible for the particle @xmath162 to move from its position without decreasing the distance to any one of the particles .",
    "this can be seen if one drops the perpendiculars to the lines @xmath165 and @xmath166 from the point @xmath169 .",
    "if the point @xmath162 is moved along either of these lines , it will be getting closer to the point @xmath169 .",
    "but that in turn implies that it can not be moved into the region @xmath171 at all without decreasing the distance from the point @xmath172 .    if the particle is outside the region @xmath170 , for example a point like @xmath173 , then it is easy to see that by moving along one of the tangents to the circles at the point @xmath162 , the particle at @xmath162 can move away from all the three other points .",
    "thus we find that the earlier statement we made is proved .",
    "this gives us a nice way to maximize the shortest distance since all one has to do is to make the three distances involved equal , so that if the central particles tries to move , then one of the distances has to decrease ."
