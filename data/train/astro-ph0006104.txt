    "how many regions of massive star formation are there in the galactic disk and how are they distributed ?",

    "dust extinction prevents optical observations of ob associations farther than 3 kpc from the sun .",
    "an alternative way to study the population of recently formed ob stars in the galaxy is to use observations at longer wavelenghts in the far infrared ( fir ) , where the ism is more transparent .",
    "ultraviolet light from ob stars , born in the dense dusty cores of giant molecular clouds , ionizes the closeby gas creating ultracompact ( uc ) h ii regions and heating the surrounding dust , which reradiates the energy mostly in the fir .",
    "the star - forming region becomes thus detectable by iras , generally as a point - like source .",
    "but which of the many iras point - like sources in the galactic plane are heated by embedded massive stars ? the fir spectral characteristics of uc h ii regions identified with the vla have been studied by wood & churchwell ( 1989a ) , who calibrated their fir colours as a tool for their identification . applying their criterion to the iras point - like sources in the galactic plane , they found 1646 sources which , according to their iras 60@xmath19/12@xmath19 and 25@xmath19/12@xmath19 flux ratios , are candidates to be sites of ob star formation containing uc h ii regions ( wood & churchwell 1989b ; wc89 ) .",
    "millimeter - wave emission lines from dense gas cores , where ob stars form , can be used to obtain their kinematic distances and derive the fir luminosity of their associated dust , heated by the embedded stellar sources .",
    "the @xmath20 line has been surveyed toward iras point - like sources in the outer galaxy ( wouterloot & brand 1996 ; and references therein ) , using less restrictive fir colors criteria . within the solar circle ,",
    "however , where the majority of massive star formation takes place , there are several molecular clouds at different distances for most lines of sight , yielding complex co velocity profiles .",
    "the @xmath21 line , affected by large optical depths , will tell us little about the dense interior of molecular clouds .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 lines , of intermediate and low opacity in the galactic plane , are still sensitive to molecular gas column density , which can be enhanced not only toward dense cores but also toward extended regions of intermediate density .",

    "its @xmath24 rotational line , at a frequency of 99 ghz , has an excitation density threshold of @xmath25 - @xmath26 @xmath27 and is ubiquitous toward regions of massive star formation but seldom elsewhere in the galactic disk - with the exception of the galactic center region ( bally et al .",

    "the @xmath28 profiles obtained in such survey are singular ; the dense gas cores are associated one - to - one with the heated dust which produces the fir emission detected by iras as a point - like source .",

    "the observed sources were selected from the iras psc ( version 1 ) , using exactly the same criterion as in wc89 .",
    "they are all located near the galactic plane , they have a @xmath35 flux ratio larger than 3.7 and a @xmath36 flux ratio larger than 19.3 , and are not identified as stars or galaxies .",

    "the survey covered @xmath37 for longitudes corresponding to the inner galaxy , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for the rest of the galactic plane the latitude coverage was @xmath40 .",
    "of the 1427 sources observed , the survey detected 843 ( 59% ) above a level of @xmath41 k peak t@xmath42 ( bnm ) , with a few detections below this level , particularly in the far outer galaxy ( table 1 ) .",
    "of the total number of sources detected , 37% are in the i quadrant ; 10% in the ii quadrant ; 11% in the iii quadrant , and 42% in the iv quadrant .",
    "the fraction of detected sources is 0.58 toward the outer galaxy ( ii and iii quadrants ) , and 0.60 toward the inner galaxy ( i and iv quadrants ) ; toward certain longitudes in the direction of the molecular annulus , however , the number of detected sources more than doubles that of undetected ones .",

    "3.5 )    @xmath55    using the kinematic information provided by the @xmath28 line for the detected iras sources , we have derived their galactocentric distances assuming purely circular motion about the galactic center . for simplicity we used a linear rotation curve and the standard iau constants , @xmath56 kpc and @xmath57 km @xmath58 . for lines of sight toward the galactic center and anticenter the vlsrs of the sources are small and may have large fractional errors due to systematic or random peculiar motions .",
    "thus , for the analysis here we have excluded all sources within 10@xmath59 of the galactic center and within 5@xmath59 of the anticenter .",
    "therefore , a total number of 748 detected sources have been used for the present analysis ( table 1 ) , of which 349 ( 47% ) are in the northern galaxy ( i and ii quadrants ) and 399 ( 53% ) are in the southern galaxy ( iii and iv quadrant ) .    after finding the galactocentric distance @xmath60 for each source",

    "there are two possible kinematic heliocentric distances allowed by the rotation curve and , therefore , two possible values of @xmath63 .",

    "while it is clear that each source is either at the near or at the far distance within the solar circle , the weights used in the statistical averages account for the probability of each source to be at the near or far distance by using the well known _",
    "latitude effect _ , i. e. , the farther away a source , the more likely to be close to the galactic plane .",
    "the weights are used only to derive large scale averages in a statistical sense , and not individually to derive a mean distance for each source .",
    "the results of the iterative calculation are displayed in fig .",
    "4 and listed in table 2 ; empty spaces in the table correspond to those rings where the number of detected sources is less than 3 , not enough to have a convergent iteration so as to derive values for @xmath79 and @xmath83 .",
    "the azimuthally averaged face - on fir surface luminosity is evaluated by summing the luminosities of the sources in each ring and dividing the result by the sampled area .",
    "the average luminosity per source is the ratio of the summed luminosity in each ring to the number of sources considered .",
    "we estimate the fir flux of a source as the sum over the four iras bands ,    @xmath84    where @xmath85 are the iras band flux densities , as listed in the iras psc ( prault 1987 ) .",
    "the fir luminosity for each source , outside the solar circle , is computed as @xmath86 , where d is its kinematic distance , obtained from its cs(2 - 1 ) line profile .",
    "we overcome the two - fold distance ambiguity , within the solar circle , by evaluating the total luminosity in each ring , @xmath87 , as a weighted sum . like for the @xmath63 moments , in that sum we use the _ latitude effect _ to take into account the probability for each source to be at the near or far distance in the galactic disk , i. e. ,    @xmath88\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the luminosities that the source would have at the near and far distances , respectively .",

    "the fir surface luminosity produced by regions of massive star formation and the average fir luminosity per region , as a function of @xmath60 , are shown in table 3 and fig .",
    "3 . the procedure used to remove the distance ambiguity , within the solar circle , is fully equivalent to the _ direct partitioning _ technique used to derive the h@xmath12 surface density in paper i ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) and fig .",
    "@xmath92      the errors in the number surface density @xmath93 consider only the counting statistics assuming a poisson distribution .",
    "the uncertainties in the best values of the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath83 were estimated on the basis that the errors are dominated by the peculiar motions of the sources , which we assume to be of @xmath94 km s@xmath95 ( vlsr ) . using this value we",
    "have then calculated the uncertainties in the kinematic distances , and in the quantities which are derived from the kinematic distances . at @xmath96 , in the northern galaxy , the average luminosity per source is dominated by one source , g70.293 ( bnm ) , a very bright uc h ii region in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath97 values have also a contribution from the instrumental errors in the iras detectors .",
    "we used the errors in the 100 @xmath19 m band as representative of the fractional flux uncertainty for each source ( casassus et al .",
    "when the flux value obtained by iras is only an upper limit , the error has been assumed to be of @xmath98% .",
    "there is also some level of correlation in the position of the sources ; as an example , for massive star forming gmcs in the iv galactic quadrant there are @xmath99 embedded uc h ii regions per gmc ( bronfman 1992 ) .",
    "we have taken into account such correlation by computing for each galactocentric ring @xmath100 , the average number of sources that lie within a box of sides 2@xmath59 by 2@xmath59 by 20 km s@xmath95 - a representative maximum value for a gmc - and multiplying the errors in @xmath97 at each ring by @xmath101 .",
    "what are the shortcomings in our analysis caused by deviations from axial symmetry in the galactic distribution of embedded ob stars ?",
    "images of external galaxies clearly show a high concentration of massive star formation in spiral arms , and the same should be expected for our own galaxy . while the large scale distribution of ob stars in the milky way can not be traced optically because of dust obscuration in the disk , h ii regions produced by these stars",
    "can be observed in radio - recombination lines , like h109@xmath102 , and have been used to study the spiral arm structure of our galaxy ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ; downes et al .",
    "the uc h ii regions , which point at very young star forming regions , still embedded in their parental molecular clouds , could be even more confined to spiral arms than the extended h ii regions observed in centimetric wavelengths .",
    "spiral arms within the solar circle appear to be more separated and less difficult to trace in the southern galaxy than in its northern counterpart .",
    "these arms , as outlined by co emission from molecular clouds , are tangent to the line of sight at longitudes @xmath103 ( carina ) ; @xmath104 ( crux ) ; @xmath105 ( norma ) ; and @xmath106 ( 3-kpc expanding arm ) .",
    "the tangent longitudes are traced by discontinuities in ( a ) the galactic co emission integrated in velocity and latitude i(@xmath107 ) ( paper i ; grabelsky et al .",
    "1987 ) and in ( b ) the rotation curve derived from co observations ( alvarez et al .",
    "the distribution of h ii regions in the southern galaxy , derived from an extensive survey of hydrogen recombination lines toward 5 ghz continuum sources ( caswell & haynes 1987 ) , is consistent also with the presence of these four spiral arm segments in the iv galactic quadrant .",
    "to test our axisymmetric analysis we have derived the mean radial distribution of uc h ii regions in the southern galaxy in the framework of this generally accepted spiral arm model .",
    "most gmcs identified through co observations in the southern galaxy are coincident , in space and velocity , with one or more radio h ii regions from the caswell & haynes ( 1987 ) sample , as well as with several uc h ii regions from the dataset we analyze here .",
    "we have used those radio h ii regions from caswell & haynes that have well defined distances , derived through h@xmath12co absorption lines , to remove the distance ambiguity for the associated gmcs and for their embedded uc h ii regions ( bronfman 1992 ) .",
    "these gmcs , together with the tangent points listed above , trace a spiral arm pattern in the longitude - velocity diagram ( fig .",
    "the distance ambiguity for the remaining gmcs is removed by assigning each one to the closest spiral feature in the longitude - velocity diagram .",
    "for some gmc s in the far side of the crux arm , close to the solar circle , we use their size - to - linewidth ratio to distinguish them from local clouds with small vlsrs .",
    "the mean radial distribution of fir surface luminosity produced by embedded uc h ii regions , obtained using the spiral model , is fairly similar to that obtained using the axisymmetric analysis ( fig .",
    "the average luminosity per source ( fig .",
    "6b ) shows a secondary peak , close to @xmath108 , caused by the far side of the crux spiral arm cutting through the solar circle at @xmath109 .",
    "we do not quote errors in this comparison because the spiral model , although well updated , involves much uncertainty and we are mainly interested in the general trend of the mean radial variations .",
    "it is apparent that the peaks are at the same positions and the general shapes are the same for both analyses .",
    "the axisymmetric analysis , however , seems to overestimate the mean fir luminosities for radii other than the main peak locus .",
    "the question of completeness has been adressed in general by wc89 , who show that uc h ii regions are tightly confined in the fir color - color plot , and can be easily distinguished from other entries in the iras psc .",
    "thus , the distinctive fir colors of embedded massive stars can be used to count the number of such objects in the galaxy .",
    "they conclude that all embedded o stars and some b stars will be detected by the color - color criterion applied to the iras psc in the galaxy .",
    "contamination of the sample by cloud cores with lower mass stars has been analyzed by ramesh & sridharan ( 1997 ) , who argue that the total number of potential uc h ii regions in the wc89 sample is only about 25% of the sample .",
    "our own criterion , based on the detection of the cs(2 - 1 ) line toward each of the uc h ii region candidates ( bnm ) , brings down the original wc89 sample by a factor of @xmath110 .",
    "we analyze here the question of completeness of the sample as a function of distance ; this is particularly necessary to understand the behaviour of the number density and mean luminosity of sources near the solar circle .",
    "the fir luminosity versus distance for all sources in the sample analyzed is shown in fig .",
    "the fairly homogeneous distribution in distance of sources with fir luminosities larger than @xmath111 suggests that our sample is complete above such luminosity level .",
    "closer than @xmath112 kpc from the sun the sample appears to be contaminated by lower luminosity sources . to test our results",
    "we have reanalyzed our data applying a lower fir luminosity cutoff to the sample , both for the spiral and for the axisymmetric model .",
    "wouterlout et al .",
    "( 1995 , their fig .",
    "20b ) show that the wc89 fir color criterion for uc h ii regions tends to select point sources with @xmath113 .",
    "thus , even if the iras psc were more sensitive , there would be little point in reducing the luminosity limit much under @xmath114 .",
    "the cs(2 - 1 ) detection requirement appears not to introduce additional biases so we consider unnecessary to address separately the completeness of the cs survey .",
    "the observed antenna temperatures t@xmath42 within the solar circle , in particular for the subcentral sources , are not distance dependant . for sources outside the solar circle ,",
    "the average t@xmath42 is 0.9 k for distances between 2 and 6 kpc , and 0.6 k beyond .",
    "the sest beamwidth of 50 \" ( fwhm ) projects a linear size of 2.4 pc at 10 kpc , about the typical size of cs cores harbouring massive star formation ( bronfman 1992 ) , so beam - dilution is not a stringent problem for the cs detections .",
    "the mean radial distribution of the fir surface luminosity does not change noticeably when a lower cutoff luminosity is applied to the sample .",
    "we have computed the azimuthally averaged fir surface luminosity and the mean luminosity per source as a function of galactocentric radius , using the same spiral analysis as in sect .",
    "3.4 within the solar circle , and a lower cutoff luminosity @xmath115 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "8 , and the number of sources above the cutoff is listed , for each ring , in table 1 ( in parenthesis ) . at the cutoff value used , the three peaks in the average luminosity per source have the same magnitude , i.e @xmath116 .",
    "these peaks are dominated by sources located in the far sides of the norma arm ( @xmath117 ) , the crux arm ( @xmath118 ) , and the carina arm ( @xmath119 ) .    while we can not , for the time being , confirm that the average luminosity per source diminishes with galactocentric radius , it is tempting to suggest that uc h ii regions appear to be very good tracers of spiral arm structure in the galaxy , and that a full spiral analysis of their distribution in the milky way is mandatory .",
    "while in the present paper we perform a zeroth order axisymmetric comparison of the distribution of ob star formation regions and of molecular clouds , there is an evident necessity of resolving the two - fold distance ambiguity for all these regions in order to refine the present results , within the solar circle , and extend them toward a more exact analysis of the mean luminosity per source , which has a direct impact on the determination of the imf for massive star forming regions .",
    "the fir surface luminosity derived from the axisymmetric analysis , our main result , remains also fairly unchanged ( fig .",
    "3 ) when a lower luminosity cutoff is applied to the sample .",
    "the fir surface luminosity at each radius is the product of the number of sources considered , per unit area , times their average luminosity . while the number surface density of sources decreases when a luminosity cutoff is applied , particularly for the solar neighborhood , the average luminosity per source increases , since we are not taking into account the less luminous sources for the average .",
    "therefore the results we present next , based on our determination of the fir surface luminosity produced by embedded massive stars and its comparison with the h@xmath12 surface density within the solar circle , appear to be not too affected by problems of completeness .",
    "as for the effects of spiral structure over the derived fir surface density , they are small and would have presummably the same effects over the distribution of molecular hydrogen derived using an axisymmetric model .",
    "the formation of ob stars in the galactic disk is distributed in a layer coincident but thinner than that of molecular clouds as traced by co. fig .",
    "9 shows the radial variations of the centroid @xmath79 and the thickness ( hwhm ) @xmath83 of the embedded massive star layer for the southern and northern galaxy , compared with their h@xmath12 counterparts .",
    "the molecular gas parameters were derived from the columbia u. - u. chile deep co surveys of the i and iv galactic quadrants ( paper i ; cohen et al .",
    "1986 ) ; from surveys of the carina region by grabelsky et al . ( 1987 ) and of the iii galactic quadrant by may et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1993 ) , analyzed by casassus ( 1995 ) ; and from a _ composite _",
    "co dataset of the ii quadrant analyzed by digel ( 1991 ) .",
    "the average thickness of the embedded massive star distribution , within the solar circle , is 73 pc ( fwhm ) , compared with 118 pc ( fwhm ) for the layer of molecular gas traced by co ( tables 6 and 7 ) .",
    "it has been shown by dame & thaddeus ( 1994 ) , however , that there are possibly two components for the molecular gas layer : a thin one , with a fwhm of 80 pc , similar to the thickness of the young massive stars layer derived here , and a thick and diffuse one , with a fwhm in excess of 500 pc .",
    "the warping of the disk outside the solar circle , as traced by the centroid @xmath79 of both the massive star formation and the h@xmath12 layer , appears to be more pronounced in the northern galaxy than in the south .",
    "a tentative explanation is that the spiral arms outside the solar circle can be traced within a larger longitude range in the south than in the north ; we may be therefore averaging out the warp in azimuth in the south because of the large longitude span ( casassus 1995 ; may et al . 1997 ) .",
    "for example , it is apparent from fig . 2 than there are many more sources detected outside the solar circle in the iv quadrant than in the i quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "the flaring of the molecular gas layer in the outer galaxy is evidenced by both the molecular and by the embedded massive star distribution in the south . however , while the thickness of the massive star layer in the northern outer galaxy grows like that in the south , the mean thickness of the molecular hydrogen layer in the northern outer galaxy is only about half that of its southern counterpart .",
    "a possible explanation is that while the longitude coverage of our survey of embedded massive stars is equally complete north and south , the _ composite _ co data set of the northern outer galaxy analyzed by digel ( 1991 ) only covers the region @xmath120 , compared to the complete longitude coverage of the iii and iv quadrant co surveys used by casassus ( 1995 ) in his analysis .",
    "therefore the azimuthal range for the average is much larger in the south than in the north ; averaging the galactic warp over large scales would increase the mean thickness derived for the molecular gas layer .      the mean radial distribution for the 748 massive star forming regions analyzed here ( fig 3 ) is maximum at @xmath121 , falls sharply toward the galactic center , and decays exponentially toward the outer galaxy ( fig . 10 ) .",

    "a possible explanation of such result could be that massive stars in the i galactic quadrant are preferentially in the far side of the galaxy , and/or that in the iv quadrant they are preferentially in the near side .",
    "thus , by assuming axial symmetry in our models , we could be artificially inflating the luminosity in the south or lowering it in the north .",
    "however , because the fir luminous dense molecular gas cores we have sampled in the cs(2 - 1 ) are well correlated in space and velocity with the population of giant molecular clouds in the galaxy as traced by co ( bronfman 1992 ) , the same asymmetry should be found in the distribution of molecular gas .",
    "but what we find here for the fir surface luminosity distribution is an asymmetry from north to south which is opposite in sign to that of the molecular gas surface density .",
    "massive star formation per unit h@xmath12 mass , as a consequence , is higher in the iv than in the i galactic quadrant .",
    "the average fir luminosity to h@xmath12 mass ratio in the southern galaxy , for @xmath184 , is @xmath185 ; for @xmath143 grows to 0.28 ; and for @xmath186 we find a galactic maximum of @xmath16 . in comparison ,",
    "the corresponding numbers in the northern galaxy are @xmath187 , @xmath18 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the enhancement of massive star formation at @xmath188 in the southern galaxy appears to be correlated with the position of the norma spiral arm tangent , where a large fraction of the most luminous sources in the sample are found .",
    "massive star formation enhancements of this kind have been observed in the spiral arms of external galaxies , like for instance in m51 ( nakai et al .",
    "1994 ) , although there the starburst seems to be driven by a companion galaxy . in our own galaxy",
    "such burst could be driven by a bar - that would have to be large enough to produce an effect at almost 5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "preliminary results of our ongoing analysis of gmcs harbouring embedded uc h ii regions in the southern galaxy show a fairly linear relation between the fir luminosity from embedded ob stars and the virial mass of the clouds , with a mean fir luminosity to mass ratio of @xmath189 ( bronfman et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this ratio grows to @xmath190 , for gmcs associated with bright h ii regions , when the fir luminosity is computed from iras sky - flux images ( mooney & solomon 1988 ) .",
    "therefore we suggest a lower limit of @xmath191 for the contribution of embedded ob stars to the total fir emission from gmcs undergoing massive star formation . our estimate can be considered as a lower limit because",
    ": ( a ) some embedded ob stars are likely to illuminate dust regions so large in angular size that they would not be identified as iras point sources and therefore not included in our sample and , ( b ) if identified , some of the source fir flux may have been lost because of the background subtraction .",
    "the ratio of fir luminosity produced by embedded massive stars to virial mass for gmcs in the southern galaxy , @xmath189 , is similar to the fir surface luminosity to h@xmath12 surface density ratio found at the peak of the southern distribution of embedded ob stars , @xmath192 .",
    "therefore it is possible to suggest that most gmcs in that region of the galaxy are presently forming massive stars , and it appears reasonable to use such value as a standard scale to evaluate the massive star formation efficiency per unit h@xmath12 mass in the rest of the galaxy relative to its maximum value .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind , though , that here we are averaging the h@xmath12 surface density over large areas of the galaxy , several kpc@xmath193 in size .",
    "therefore our maximum value for the fir luminosity to h@xmath12 mass ratio will be much smaller than that obtained when computed only for the neighborhood of a massive star forming region , with a typical fir luminosity of @xmath194 and a virial mass of @xmath195 ( plume et al .",
