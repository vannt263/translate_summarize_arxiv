    "the higgs boson sector remains the most mysterious part of theories of electroweak unification . to probe this illusive sector one",
    "is well advised to keep an open mind .",
    "most analyses of the higgs sector , in the standard model or beyond , ignore potential cp violation . however , in many these models , even the lightest neutral higgs boson can have interesting cp violating phenomena . in many models of cp violation , including the standard model ,",
    "cp violation is a consequence of simultaneous existence of many coupling constants .",
    "such requirement results in the presence of many coupling constants and/or loop suppression factors in the observables .",
    "the neutral higgs sector is unique in the sense that a single higgs boson coupling to a massive fermion is enough to manifest cp violation as long as the yukawa coupling contains both scalar and pseudoscalar components .",
    "therefore , in many ways the cp violating aspect may be the most interesting part of the higgs boson physics beyond the the standard model once a neutral higgs is identified .    in a previous paper , we investigated the signatures of various cp  odd asymmetries in different polarized decay modes the neutral higgs boson@xcite . among the interesting modes",
    "are the cp asymmetries in the event rate differences @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "as expected , the cp asymmetries will manifest themselves only after the final state interactions are taken into account .",
    "for the heavy quark pair , @xmath11 , mode or the @xmath1 pair mode , the relative energy of the final state charged leptons can be used as the polarization analyzers of the heavy quarks or the @xmath12 s @xcite .",
    "however for the case of the @xmath0 mode , the @xmath13 coupling to charged leptons is mainly axial - vectorial .",
    "therefore the efficiency of using its leptonic energy spectrum as the polarization analyzer is suppressed by a factor of @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we consider a different kind of signal of cp violation : the cp  odd correlations of final state momenta . note that this is different from the more conventional t - odd signals which can be imitated by cp conserving final state interactions .",
    "no final state interaction is required to obtain the signals .",
    "therefore , unlike the case of the cp asymmetry considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not necessary to cross a heavy fermion threshold to obtain a large signal in the @xmath1 or the @xmath0 channel . for earlier discussions of cp  odd effects in different processes ,",
    "see refs.@xcite .",
    "let us start with the @xmath0 mode whose cp  odd asymmetry does not translate into large lepton energy asymmetry . after the @xmath13 s decay",
    "there are three modes of final state : ( 1 ) @xmath16 , ( 2 ) @xmath17 , ( 3 ) @xmath18 .",
    "the purely leptonic modes are of course the easy ones in which to get a cp  odd correlation provided that we collect enough events . in the bigger samples of the semileptonic modes and the hadronic ones , it is difficult to tell the charge of the leading quark when it hadronizes into a jet . however , the most intriguing part of our result is that it is not necessary to identify charge to detect the cp  odd signal , an argument we will elaborate on later",
    ". this observation will be even more crucial in trying to decode cp ",
    "odd signals in the @xmath19 or @xmath20 modes of the higgs decay .",
    "another important point is that in modes ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , the lepton pairs or the quark pairs do not have to be distinct . as we will show later",
    ", the identical particle effect does not wash out the main cp  odd signal",
    ". we shall discuss these modes in order .",

    "the correlation between the polarizations of the two @xmath13 bosons translates into the correlation between the two planes of the @xmath23 pairs .",
    "in fact this observation was used a long time ago to measure the parity of the @xmath24 through its decay into two photons@xcite .",
    "when the higgs coupling is neither scalar nor pseudoscalar , one has a source of cp violation .",
    "we shall explore this case .",

    "the @xmath30 term is cp  odd while the @xmath29 term is cp  even .",
    "simultaneous presence of @xmath30 and @xmath29 is cp violating .",
    "we have ignored higher dimensional cp - even operators in the above lagrangian and a possible cp violating @xmath32 vertex which could also contribute to four fermions final states .",
    "their effect should be negligible at the pole of the final state z boson . in momentum space ,",
    "these effective vertices give rise to the covariant amplitude : @xmath33 \\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 are the polarizations and @xmath35 are the momenta of the two @xmath13 bosons .",

    "the subscripts @xmath41 denote respectively the helicities @xmath42 of the @xmath13 bosons .",
    "conservation of angular momentum implies only the above three helicity configurations for this decay process . under cp transformation , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 is cp  odd , however re  @xmath30 is cp@xmath45even , while i m  @xmath30 is cp@xmath45odd . the detail definition of cp@xmath45 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is roughly the cpt symmetry without reversing the initial and the final states , that is , the symmetry reverses only the kinematic variables of the states according to their cpt property .",

    "is encoded in the @xmath48 density matrix @xmath49 which is folded with the @xmath13 decay amplitudes to produce the event distribution .",

    "it can also be written in a lorentz invariant form @xmath61 however , as we will show later , the expectation value of this observable @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the vector and axial vector couplings of the @xmath13 boson .",
    "since the vector coupling of the @xmath13 boson to the charged leptons in the standard model is relatively small , this observable turns out to be rather unimportant .",
    "it can be understood as the consequence of an approximate symmetry when the vector coupling ( or the axial vector coupling ) is ignored completely , so that there is no distinction between @xmath66 and @xmath67 as far as the @xmath13 boson is concerned .",
    "therefore the differential decay rate is symmetric under two separate partial charge conjugation symmetries , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "interchanges @xmath66 and @xmath67 while leaving @xmath70 , @xmath71 unchanged ; while the symmetry @xmath69 interchanges @xmath70 and @xmath71 and leaving @xmath66 , @xmath67 unchanged instead .",
    "the usual charge conjugation operation @xmath72 is the product of the the two @xmath73 s .",
    "it is easy to check that the correlation @xmath74 is odd under either @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "therefore it has nonvanishing expectation value only when both @xmath75 and @xmath76 couplings are nonzero .",
    "it is certainly more desirable to use an observable which is cp  odd but even under each @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",

    "a typical reaction is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "under cp transformation , @xmath78 is transformed into @xmath79 .",
    "if one defines a plane using the cross product of one of the lepton pairs , say @xmath80 , as the direction of the normal vector , the configurations with the momentum of the other lepton ( @xmath81 ) coming out of the plane is the cp conjugate of the configurations in which @xmath81 is going into the plane .",
    "therefore the asymmetry , @xmath82 , can be interpreted as a kind of up - down asymmetry .",

    "1 . then one can label the event configuration by the angles @xmath93 .",
    "the energies @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the higgs boson rest frame for the leptons @xmath96 and @xmath91 respectively are determined by their polar angles @xmath83 and @xmath86 . under @xmath68 , @xmath69 , parity and cp",
    ", the configuration transforms as follows , @xmath97 to understand observables such as @xmath98 , one can divide the azimuthal angle @xmath84 into four quadrants , i , ii , iii , iv . since @xmath68 transforms ( i , ii ) into ( iii , iv ) , it is clear that the up  down asymmetry @xmath82 which corresponds to the angular integration of ( i + ii ) @xmath99 ( iii + iv ) is odd under @xmath68 or @xmath69 . on the other hand , an observable similar to @xmath100",
    "can be constructed by the alternative angular integration ( i+iii)-(ii+iv ) .",
    "to calculate these asymmetries , we need the differential distribution : @xmath101 we denote the helicity amplitude @xmath102 describing the process @xmath103 in the @xmath13 rest frame , where the spin projection of the @xmath13 boson along the @xmath104 axis is @xmath105 and the helicity of @xmath96 is specified by @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",

    "note that , in the heavy higgs limit @xmath148 , the @xmath136 contribution becomes relatively important because of the kinematic suppression factor @xmath149 in the other contribution of @xmath137 in eq.([eq : intodd ] ) .",
    "we can generalize our formalism to the case that @xmath96 and @xmath91 are different fermions of different couplings @xmath150 and @xmath151 . the replacements in eqs.([eq : master],[eq : intodd][eq : aintas ] ) are given by the following rules , @xmath152 this applies also to the case @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "one of the main problems of using the hadronic or semi - hadronic decay modes of the higgs boson in searching for cp violating signals is that experimentally it is impossible to identify charges of jets originating from hadronization of the partons .",
    "therefore one essentially has to smear over the charge information .",
    "naively one may think that it will make cp information impossible to disentangle .",
    "this turns out not the case in the observable @xmath155 , which is even under both @xmath156 and @xmath157 separately .",
    "thus , in @xmath155 the contribution of an event and its @xmath156conjugate event will add , while in @xmath74 they will cancel .",
    "therefore , charge identification is not necessary for the observable @xmath158 . to construct the observable ,",
    "we revisit the definition of @xmath84 in the general case .",
    "each pair of fermions defines a plane .",
    "given two un  oriented planes one can define the angle @xmath159 between planes to be @xmath160 or @xmath161 ( @xmath162 by definition ) .",
    "these two choices are not resolved yet . however , if the common line of the two planes can be physically assigned a direction associated with one of the planes , then the two angles @xmath160 and @xmath161 can be distinguished .",
    "for example in the @xmath163 decay , see fig .  1 , we can simply use the vector @xmath164 to define a direction associated with the @xmath165 plane . then , using the right hand rule , one can rotate along the axis @xmath166 and sweep the plane of @xmath167 toward the plane of @xmath165 and define the resulting angle @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "it is important to notice that choosing @xmath169 to define the angle , instead of @xmath166 , gives the same result .",
    "( therefore the two fermion pairs can be identical without smearing out the effect . ) on the other hand , the azimuthal angle @xmath84 defined in fig .",
    "1 with full identification varies from 0 to @xmath170 , and the relation between them is simply @xmath171mod@xmath172 .",
    "so the event rate at @xmath173 ( @xmath174 by definition ) is the sum of the elementary rates @xmath175 , thus the dependences on @xmath136 in eq.([eq : intodd ] ) and @xmath176 in eq.([eq : inteven ] ) will be washed away .",
    "however , the @xmath137 term survives to signal the cp violation .",
    "of course , if one can identify the charges of the final fermions , as in the case of leptonic modes , then one can also decode the @xmath136 term as well . to detect the @xmath137 dependence",
    ", one can use the same integrated asymmetry , @xmath145 , as in eq.([eq : aintasy ] ) except in this case the sums @xmath177 and @xmath178 are automatically taken care of by the definition of @xmath159 .",
    "therefore eq.([eq : aintasy ] ) is still valid even in the case of @xmath179 or @xmath180 decay modes .",
    "note that for these modes the asymmetries corresponding to eq.([eq : aintas ] ) are not doubly suppressed by the small @xmath181 as in the purely leptonic modes .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath125 is not observable due to the lack of hadronic charge identification .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that if one is willing to zoom into the dependence of the amplitudes on the jet energies ( or , equivalently , on the angles @xmath83 , or @xmath86 ) then it may be possible to use energy identification to replace charge identification to construct an observable similar to @xmath125 .",
    "note that for the cp conserving decay , the angular correlation we just described can also be used to detect the important @xmath182 distribution even for the semi - hadronic modes , @xmath179 , or the hadronic modes , @xmath180 , of the @xmath163 decay .",
    "once one understands how the cp ",
    "odd correlation can be decoded in the hadronic modes of @xmath163 decay , it is easy to apply it to the process @xmath184 also . in this case",

    "we show @xmath196 , @xmath195 versus @xmath146 per unit of @xmath197 .",

    "unfortunately , @xmath196 is not observable due to lack of charge identification .",
    "however , as commented earlier for the @xmath0 case , it may be possible to replace charge identification by energy identification to construct an observable similar to @xmath196 .    for the purely hadronic mode",
    ", there is tremendous background from non  resonant contributions in the hadronic environment .",
    "the @xmath198 collider may be a cleaner machine in which the higgs boson may be produced via the process @xmath199 .",
    "then , one can use the decay @xmath200 to tag the recoiling higgs boson @xmath22 which turns into a @xmath19 pair and finally becomes 4 jets , whose cp character can be decoded using the angular correlation defined earlier .",
    "in addition , our study of the angular correlation can be very useful in investigating the general cp  odd or cp  even correlations in other reactions , for example , the hadronic final states of the process @xmath201@xcite .    [ [ section ] ]    @xmath202    the possibility of detecting cp violation in @xmath202 is very interesting in the sense that the corresponding cp violating couplings can occur at the tree  level .",

    "however , in reality , its signal is harder to decode . the @xmath20 pair decay into @xmath207 .",
