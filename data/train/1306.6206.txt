    "system dynamics ( sd ) is an approach to help understand the behaviour of complex systems over time .",
    "it works with feedback loops , stocks and flows that help describe a system s nonlinearity .",
    "the methodology of developing sd models suggest some stages that should be accomplished in order to reach the final model .",
    "the first stage is identification of the problem followed by development of a dynamic hypothesis explaining its causes .",
    "the next stages are building the computational model , testing , validation and implementation .    agent based modelling ( abs ) is concerned with models in which agents interact with each other , with a view to observing their behaviors given changes to the environment .",
    "this work compares sd and abs immune system aging models that involve interactions which influence the naive t cell populations over time .",
    "the models are based on the mathematical equations defined in  @xcite . in their work ,",
    "murray et al .",
    "@xcite propose a model with a set of equations to fit observed data and estimate the likely contribution of each of the naive t cell repertoire maintenance method .    in our work , we converted the original model into simulations and observe other important points not explored in  @xcite .",
    "our objective is to understand the suitability of simulation for immune system aging problems .",
    "moreover , we want to establish a comparison between the sd and abs results , in terms of accuracy and complexity . in order to understand the problem and how the model was created ,",
    "some concepts involving the aging of the immune system will be presented .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the related work review , section 3 presents the immunological concepts necessary for the understanding of the modelled problem .",
    "next , in section 4 , the conceptual and mathematical model are presented .",
    "sections 5 and 6 present , respectively , the system dynamics and the agent based models , followed by the results obtained , conclusions and next steps of this ongoing work .",
    "in this section , we briefly present some of the research literature related to the comparison of abs with sd .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show the application of both sd and abs to simulate non - equilibrium ligand - receptor dynamics over a broad range of concentrations .",
    "they concluded that both approaches are powerful tools and are also complementary .",
    "in addition , in their case study , they did not indicate a preferred paradigm , although sd is an obvious choice when studying systems at a high level of aggregation and abstraction , and abs is well suited to studying phenomena at the level of individual receptors and molecules .    in @xcite the authors present a cross - study of sd and abs .",
    "they define their features and characteristics and contrast the two methods .",
    "in addition they present ideas of how to integrate both approaches .",
    "the theoretical work presented by @xcite compares abs and sd conceptually , and discusses the potential synergy between them in order to solve problems of teaching decision - making processes .",
    "the work presented in @xcite also compares these modelling approaches and identify a list of likely opportunities for cross - fertilization .",
    "the list presented is not exhaustive and should be a starting point to other researchers to take such synergistic views even further .    in our work",
    ", we intend to proceed with this investigation using as case studies simulations related to the aging of the immune system . in the next section we present concepts necessary to understand our case study .",
    "aging is a complex process that negatively impacts on the development of the immune system and its ability to function  @xcite .",
    "the changes that characterise the aging of the immune system are called collectively _ immunosenescence _ or _ decrease in immunocompetence_.    the decrease of immunocompetence in the elderly can be envisaged as the result of the continuous challenge of the unavoidable exposure to a variety of viruses , bacteria , food and other harmful substances  @xcite .",
    "these exposures cause persistent life - long immune system stress , responsible for filling of the `` immunological space '' by an accumulation of immune cells and immune memory cells  @xcite .    with age",
    ", there is also a significant reduction of certain specific kinds of immune cells , such as naive t cells , caused by the shrinkage of the organ that generates them , i.e. the thymus .",
    "naive t cells are able to respond to novel pathogens that the immune system has not yet encountered .",
    "lower numbers of these cells eventually leave the body more susceptible to infectious and non - infections diseases  @xcite .    before 20 years of age",
    ", naive t cells are sustained primarily from thymic output  @xcite . however , in middle age there is a change in the source of naive t cells ; as the thymus involutes , there is considerable reduction in its t cell output .",
    "thus , new t cells are mostly produced by peripheral expansion .",
    "there is also a belief that some memory cells have their phenotype reverted back to naive cells  @xcite . over time , the repertoire of naive t cells shrinks proportionately to faced threats , while memory increases  @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , late in life , the t cell population becomes less diverse and a small number of antigen - specific t cell clones can grow to a great percentage of the total t cell population .",
    "this takes over the space needed for other t cells , resulting in a less diverse and ineffective immune system .",
    "eventually , there might be not enough naive t cells left to mount an effective defense and the immunological space is filled with memory cells .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop models considering each of the above characteristics in order to investigate if these simulation techniques are suitable for investigating the immunosenescence phenomenon .",
    "de martinis  @xcite and franceschi  @xcite state that the most important characteristics of immunosenescence are the accumulation of memory t cells , reduction of naive t cells , shrinkage of the thymus and a filling of immunological space .    as we can see from the above , one of the main factors in the process of immunosenescence",
    "is the number and phenotypical variety of naive t cells in an individual , which changes with age in quantity and diversity .",
    "recent research  @xcite@xcite@xcite suggests that population - based models of t - cell repertoire evolution may guide new developments for treating diseases and help the recovery of the system after depletion caused by infections , radiation and age .",
    "these factors influenced the choice of the simulation case study developed in this research .",
    "some work @xcite has been done in simulation to understand certain aspects of immunology and other biological tissue patterns .",
    "however relatively little has been done in terms of immune degradation .",
    "hence , our conceptual model considers shrinkage of the thymus and depletion of naive t cells , which will be explained in the next section .",
    "thymic contribution in an individual are quantified by the level of a biological marker called ` t cell receptors excision circle ' ( trec ) .",
    "trec is circular dna originated during the formation of the t - cell receptor .",
    "the percentage of t cells possessing trecs decays with shrinkage of thymic output and activation and reproduction of naive t cells  @xcite .",
    "this means that naive t cells originating from the thymus have a greater percentage of trec than those originating through other proliferation .",
    "our model proposed here is based on data and equations obtained in  @xcite , which is concerned with establishing an understanding naive t cell repertoire dynamics .",
    "the objective of the model is to determine the likely contribution of each of the naive t cell s sources by comparing estimates of the presence of trec in the cells ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the sustaining sources , i.e. naive proliferation , trec and reversal of memory to naive t cells are modelled mathematically .",
    "[ fig : model ]      the mathematical model proposed in  @xcite is described by equations ( 1 ) to ( 6 ) below . in these equations , @xmath0 is the total number of naive cells of direct thymic origin , @xmath1 is the number of naive cells that have undergone proliferation , @xmath2 is the number of activated cells , @xmath3 is the number of memory cells and @xmath4 is time ( in years ) .",

    "understanding immunosenescence and its causes may help direct research into therapies that reverse some of its consequences and improve life expectancy .",
    "the research question raised within this work focuses on the feasibility of using sd and abs simulation tools to understand immune system aging and comparing the two strategies .",
    "the ability to model immune system aging will provide new means to define a patient - specific ` immune risk phenotype ' .",
    "modelling this risk type will improve our knowledge of immune factors that contribute to morbidity and mortality and facilitate the design of appropriate interventions .",
    "the main factors influencing the process of immunosenescence include the number and phenotypical variety of naive t cells in an individual , which change with age in quantity and diversity . at the beginning of life , the thymus is the principal source of naive t cells . with age , there is a decay in thymus output and a shift between the main source of naive t cells .",
    "it is believed that the sustenance of naive t cells in the organism is provided by peripheral expansion , reversion from a memory phenotype , and long - lived t cells .",
    "data related to thymic output rate was collected by  @xcite and a mathematical model was build .",
    "this mathematical model was used as the baseline for the development of sd and abs models .",
    "three simulation scenarios were studied and the simulation outputs were broadly similar for both sd and abs .",
    "hence , it is possible to conclude that the mathematical model , as well as immunosenescence problems are suitable for simulation using both techniques .",
    "the differences between the sd and abs outputs are in how the conceptual model is represented and manipulated .",
    "the sd based simulation is closer to the underlying mathematics , but has the disadvantage of being high - level , with complete homogeneity of simulated entities . on the other hand , abs allowed a representation of each entity and heterogeneity .",
    "however , abs increases the demand for computational resources .    as future work",
    ", it is intended to build a framework to develop immunosenescence simulation models .",
    "we also want to define guidelines to help decide when each simulation type should be used in an immunosenescence model .    finally , we are interested to investigate how combining abs and sd models could help improving the simulations",
    ". as we have shown , immunosenescence can be simulated by more than one simulation type , however our hypothesis is that a combination of methodologies will provide higher prediction accuracy given the same amount of input data and computational resources ."
