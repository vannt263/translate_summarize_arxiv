    "the global analysis of nuclear parton distributions ( npdfs ) is driven by the experimental fact that the deep inelastic structure functions @xmath1 measured from nuclear targets show a significant deviation from the free proton ones @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most simple theoretical approach to this observation is to make use of the factorization theorem of qcd that has proven to provide excellent description of inclusive cross - sections in free - nucleon collisions . in this approach , the cross - sections are of the generic form @xmath2 where where @xmath3 is the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) matrix element squared and @xmath4s are the non - perturbative parton densities whose scale evolution obeys the dglap equations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the global analysis of npdfs is to find out whether the observed differences in the structure functions , the nuclear modifications , can consistently be absorbed in to the input parton densities  in other words , do the nuclear modifications effectively factorize . if they do , the resulting npdfs are of great practical interest , since they can be used as a input in any process that can be factorized as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : facqcd ] ) . in this framework",
    "the deep question about the dynamical origin of nuclear modifications is not addressed , on the contrary , one must be as unbiased to any model as possible .",
    "indeed , three independent groups have shown that this approach works quite well :    * eks98 @xcite was the first global analysis demonstrating that using the leading - order ( lo ) pqcd formalism , requiring momentum and baryon number conservation , one can reproduce the data from measurements of deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan dilepton production ( dy ) in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "the fit was done only by eye .",
    "* hkm @xcite & hkn @xcite which are lo qcd analyses as well , were the first ones to exploit the automated @xmath0-minimization procedure and to estimate npdf uncertainties . *",
    "nds @xcite brought the global analysis of npdfs to the next - to - leading order level in pqcd .    based on our earlier work , eks98 ,",
    "we have performed a global reanalysis of npdfs published in @xcite and reported here . what was new compared to the eks98",
    "were the automated @xmath0-minimization procedure and a first attemp for estimating the uncertainties . although our main objective was to see whether we can improve the eks98-fit and study the uncertainties , this was anyway a necessary stepping stone for us before we can extend our analysis to nlo - level .",
    "motivated by the brahms data @xcite on inclusive hadron production in d+au collision , which show a systematic suppression relative to p+p at forward rapidities , we raise an intriguing question about the possibility of having clearly stronger gluon shadowing than what has been hitherto seen in the global dglap analyses .",
    "we define the pdfs @xmath5 of bound protons in a nucleus with mass number @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 refers to the latest free proton pdfs by the cteq collaboration @xcite . for the bound neutrons we assume the isospin symmetry @xmath9 and vice versa .",
    "what we actually parametrize , are the nuclear modifications @xmath10 at the initial scale @xmath11 . at present , the lack of precision data forces us to consider only three different modifications : @xmath12 for all valence quarks , @xmath13 for all sea quarks , and @xmath14 for gluons .",
    "the fit functions are parametrized in three pieces ( c.f . fig .",

    "the @xmath6-dependence of the fit parameters is assumed to follow a power law @xmath18 where we have chosen carbon ( @xmath19 ) as a reference nucleus .",
    "after fixing the continuity of @xmath20s and their first derivatives at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , one is still left with @xmath21 free parameters of which the baryon number and momentum conservation eat only @xmath22 away .",
    "this was still too much in order to obtain converging fits , and lots of manual work was needed too see which parameters were the most relevant ones . at the end",
    "there was @xmath23 fit parameters .",
    "the experimental input in our analysis was about @xmath24 points of dis- and dy - data in a form @xmath25 these covered @xmath26 different nuclei from helium up to lead .",

    "are shown in fig .",
    "this figure also presents our uncertainty estimates based on hessian method of quantifying the uncertainties @xcite , in which one expands the @xmath0 around the minimum w.r.t fit parameters @xmath38 as @xmath39 and the uncertainty of any quantity @xmath40 depending on pdfs is then obtained from @xmath41 ^ 2 = \\delta\\chi^2      \\sum_{i , j } \\left(\\frac{\\partial f(\\hat\\xi)}{\\partial \\xi_i}\\right )     h_{ij}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f(\\hat\\xi)}{\\partial \\xi_j}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{errors}\\ ] ] for an ideal @xmath0-distribution @xmath42 , which we used too , corresponds to `` one sigma''-error .",
    "due to technical difficulties obtaining converging fits , the emc minimum of gluons and sea quarks was fixed to follow the valence quarks at @xmath43 .",
    "this resulted as an unreliably small error bands for gluons and sea quarks , and they had to be computed separately .",
    "they are the `` large-@xmath30 errors '' in fig .",
    "the combined uncertainties are shown as a yellow bands .",
    "interestingly , the old eks98 parametrization lies within these uncertainties and there is no reason to release a new parametrization  eks98 works just fine .",
    "however , one should be very cautious about these error bands !",
    "first , below @xmath44 there is no experimental data above @xmath45 , and the behaviour at small-@xmath30 region is constrained only by the sum rules and is bound to the form of the fit function .",
    "second , the pdfs themselves depend on choices and conventions , like kinematical cuts , choosing the factorization scale , treatment of heavy quarks , and choosing and weighting data sets in forming @xmath0 .",
    "how these choices affect the obtained pdfs is not seen in the error analysis performed here  the error bands only reflect the experimental data and their errors .",
    "third , there is no well - established way to choose @xmath46 , and our choice @xmath42 is probably quite restrictive .",
    "the dy and dis data leave the gluons very unconstrained  gluon dependence comes only through the dglap - evolution .",
    "one possible way to constrain the gluon sector could be the inclusive hadron production at rhic .",
    "figure [ strong ] shows data from the brahms collaboration @xcite for @xmath47 , the ratio between charged hadron production in d+au and p+p collisions as a function of hadron s @xmath48 .",
    "minimum bias inclusive hadron production cross sections in d+au collisions divided by that in p+p collisions at @xmath49 gev at rhic . the ratio @xmath50 is shown as a function of hadrons transverse momentum at four different pseudorapidities .",

    "[ strong ] the pqcd calculation which employs the npdfs from the present analysis and kkp @xcite fragmentation functions , is shown by dark line .",
    "it is evident that , especially at very forward direction , our prediction is above the data and the shape is not well reproduced .    since hadron production at the kinematical corner of low-@xmath48 and forward rapidity reaches the small-@xmath30 region of pdfs where the gluon distributions are the dominant ones ,",
    "this could be signaling a larger uncertainty in our gluon modifications than seen in fig .",
    "for this reason we present an example of gluon shadowing that is much stronger .",
    "this is shown on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ strong ] , and it really helps : using this gluon modification the corresponding curve for @xmath47 is brought clearly closer to the brahms data",
    ".    however , it s still too early to draw very strong conclusions from this observation , but a systematic study in the context of global dglap analysis is needed @xcite .",
    "one should also bear in mind that here we are considering effects at very low - pt region , where the simple lo pqcd picture is pushed to its very limits  although one can argue that in ratios like @xmath54 some higher order effects would partially cancel .",
    "anyway , one should be very careful when interpreting these results .",
    "for example , it has been conjectured , that this particular brahms data set could be a sign of parton saturation at work @xcite .",
