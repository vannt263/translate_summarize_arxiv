    "veselago s pioneering paper on media which have negative index of optical refraction @xcite followed by practical demonstration in metamaterials @xcite initiated a time of intensive studies on their properties , fabrication and applications @xcite",
    ". such media , commonly called left - handed materials ( lhm ) , referring to the fact that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 vectors of electromagnetic wave propagating inside them forms a left - handed system , exhibit many peculiar properties such as negative refraction @xcite , reversed goos - hnchen shift @xcite , evanescent wave amplification and diffraction limit breaking @xcite just to name a few . the reversed doppler effect , described by veselago @xcite ,",
    "is one of the most characteristic features of negative index media . in these systems , in opposition to the right - handed materials , the frequency of the signal emitted by a moving source approaching the observer decreases and the signal from the receding source is upshifted .",
    "the phenomenon , which occurs for electromagnetic as well as sound waves , has been observed in a wide range of systems , including photonic crystals @xcite , magnetic thin film @xcite , transmission lines @xcite and acoustical metamaterials @xcite .",
    "another type of effects which leads to the frequency shift is so - called rotational doppler effect .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when light beam is rotated around its propagation axis and is associated with light beam carrying orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "our paper is devoted to the study the doppler effect in a one - dimensional system consisting of dispersive left - handed medium and infinitely small source of plane waves .",
    "assuming simple drude model of material dispersion , the frequency and wavelength shifts are discussed .",
    "the so - called complex doppler effect @xcite resulting in generation of multiple frequency modes is investigated in the case of negative refraction index .",
    "here we give relatively simple analytic formulas which allow one to qualitatively indicate the region of experimental parameters for which these frequency modes could be observed .",
    "the two distinct sets of solutions are applicable in the optical regime at up to relativistic source velocities and in the acoustical regime where the considered speeds are more easily realizable .",
    "the complex doppler effect has been studied by a number of authors ; bazhanova @xcite considered the effect in plasma and lisenkov _ et al _ @xcite analyzed the phenomenon in double negative media by using green s function formalism to solve helmholtz equation .",
    "here we have used first principles approach and confirmed the validity of our theoretical predictions numerically using the finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method , which is one of the most flexible algorithm commonly used to study wave propagation in metamaterials @xcite .",
    "the performed numerical simulations deal with the problem of a source moving inside negative index medium , as opposed to the more extensively studied case of reflection from moving metamaterial interface @xcite or other systems where additional frequency components might be present due to the metamaterial slab surface modes @xcite . in the case of acoustical system ,",
    "the complex doppler effect was examined for both left- and right - handed media , showing remarkable difference between these cases .",
    "consider a point radiation source s located at @xmath3 , emitting waves towards detector @xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "the two consecutive wavefronts are emitted at @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , where @xmath8 is the period of the source . in the reference frame of the detector",
    ", the source is moving at a constant velocity @xmath9 and the medium is stationary .",
    "the system , as seen in the frame @xmath4 , is shown on the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .        in the reference frame of the detector",
    ", the wave will have some shifted frequency @xmath10 .",
    "assuming that the medium is dispersive , the wave fronts will propagate at a frequency dependent phase velocity @xmath11 .",
    "two consecutive fronts will reach the detector at @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the refraction index of the medium and @xmath14 .",
    "the period of the detected wave is @xmath15 the above result can be also obtained in a straightforward way from the relativistic phase invariance which yields @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wave vector in the frame of the source and @xmath18 is the refraction index of the moving medium given by @xcite @xmath19 this result can be obtained from relativistic velocity addition .",
    "in the case when source speed @xmath20 exceeds the phase speed @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 and , in consequence , as seen in the eq .",
    "[ system1 ] , the wave emitted later will arrive at the detector first . as the period is a positive quantity , the final equation for doppler shift for source approaching ( + ) and receding from the detector ( - ) is given by implicit relation @xmath23 multiple solutions of eq .",

    "in such a case , a monochromatic source of frequency @xmath24 generates a number of wave modes with detected frequencies @xmath25 and their associated wavevectors @xmath26 .",
    "interestingly , the transformation given by eq .",
    "[ nprim ] is a one to one correspondence , so it has the property that different values of @xmath27 can not yield single value of @xmath18 .",
    "this means that , in contrast to the derivation presented in @xcite , we can assume that in the reference frame of the source , the wave is also split into multiple modes of the same frequency @xmath24 but of different wavevectors @xmath28 . only under such condition the transformations in eq .",
    "[ transf1 ] remain consistent for multiple solutions .",
    "the above derivation can be adapted to sound waves by skipping the relativistic term @xmath29 and defining @xmath30 as a speed of sound in the air in respect to which all refraction indices are defined . in left - handed medium",
    "the value of @xmath31 is negative ; this causes the reversal of doppler effect - the wave emitted in the direction of motion is downshifted ( @xmath32 ) and the backwards going one is upshifted ( @xmath33 ) . the wavelength measured in the detector frame",

    "it should be stressed that for lhm there exists the region of the source velocity where one can detect only waves moving in the direction opposite to the source motion . the range of such velocities increases for decreasing value of  @xmath42 . on the other hand , for any positive value of @xmath31 , all four modes are present at any @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dz3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the doppler spectrum obtained in the vicinity of @xmath105 shows a remarkable difference between right- and left - handed media .    in order to better understand the propagation dynamics of these waves ,",

    "approximate boundaries of low frequency modes are marked by vertical lines . ]",
    "as it was pointed out in @xcite , in the case of normal dispersion and negative value of refraction index , the absolute value of @xmath42 decreases with frequency and , according to eq .",
    "[ lambda ] , higher values of @xmath94 correspond to longer wavelength @xmath95 .",

    "[ fig:5 ] , where the wavelength of the forward going wave is noticeably shorter . for the same reason , the low frequency @xmath53 modes have very short wavelengths .",
    "such a complex effect involving reversed frequency shift and negative refraction index producing unreversed wavelength shift is similar to the case of rotational doppler effect presented in @xcite .    in order to examine the effect of absorption on the amplitude of doppler modes",

    "[ fig:7b ] . in the case of the low source velocity , the amplitude of the additional modes @xmath53 is about order of magnitude lower than the primary ones @xmath52 . in the high speed regime ,",
    "all four modes are comparable .",
    "as expected , the presence of absorption causes broadening of the frequency peaks due to the reduced time when the signal in the detector has significant amplitude . in the drude dispersion model used , lower frequency modes are significantly more damped due to the higher value of @xmath118 , making them undetectable at very low source velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7a ] ) .",
    "additionally , it was observed that the width of the @xmath103 and @xmath99 peaks increases as their group velocity approaches the source speed . by moving at a small velocity in relation to the source , those modes spread in a relatively little space around the source in a given time , which leads to a short timeframe where they can be detected .",
    "another detrimental factor is the unavoidable discontinuity of the recorded field at the moment when the source passes the detector .",
    "the general shape of obtained spectra is consistent with theoretical predictions presented in @xcite .",
    "our theoretical findings agree with the experimental results described by lee et al @xcite ; for @xmath119 and @xmath120 one obtains two detectable frequencies with ratio @xmath121 what is a good match to the reported value @xmath122 .",

    "the results are shown on the fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "when compared to the solution for acoustical waves , there are noticeable differences at high values of @xmath57 , where the relativistic effects play a significant role .",
    "most importantly , the forward going waves are visible only in one area where the source velocity is below c/7 .",
    "moreover , there exist absolute limits on the shift magnitude .",
    "minimum possible frequency for usual doppler mode is @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "maximum frequency is @xmath125 at @xmath126 .",
    "the limit can be understood by examining the implicit eq .",
    "[ dop3 ] . as the velocity of the source and frequency increase , the refraction index @xmath127 . at some point ,",
    "nonrelativistic factor @xmath128 is dominated by the lorentz factor @xmath55 , causing reduction of frequency , eventually approaching the value of @xmath24 .",
    "this is a significant departure from the solution for nondispersive medium where the asymptotic limits of the two existing frequency components are @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    .",
    "the doppler effect in left - handed medium is both reversed and complex , producing up to four frequency components in the one dimensional case .",
    "the presented theoretical predictions and fdtd simulation results for simple drude model metamaterial are very general in nature and might be treated as an approximation of a wide range of optical and acoustical systems .",
    "the existence of the four doppler modes was confirmed in simulations involving both left- and right - handed media , even with significant absorption .",
    "the solutions for sound waves show pronounced difference of frequency behaviour in these two cases . in lhm , for some range of source velocities dependent on the refracive index @xmath42 , one can observe only waves moving in the direction opposite to the source motion .",
    "the numerical source model allowed for smooth , interpolated motion even at a relatively small speed , yielding results in agreement with the experiment performed by lee et al @xcite .",
    "the performed simulations and obtained frequency spectra give insight into the dynamics of the doppler modes , their properties and dependence on the medium parameters ."
