    "in the beginning of the 20th century g.g.appelrot ( h.appelroth ) , in a series of his publications , gave deep and profound investigations of the motions of the kowalevski top @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , he found some specific families of motions and called them _ especially remarkable motions_. these results were then included into appelrot s large treatise on the gyroscopes theory and published under common title as @xcite .",
    "appelrot defined especially remarkable motions as such solutions of the corresponding euler ",
    "poisson equations for which one of the separated kowalevski variables remains constant .",
    "he pointed out four classes of such motions depending on various constraints on the integral constants leading to multiple roots of the kowalevski polynomial involved in the separated equations .",
    "the corresponding solutions are expressed as elliptic functions of time .",
    "more thorough analytical and geometrical study of these motions was given by a.f.ipatov @xcite .",
    "later it appeared that the appelrot classes play the main role in the topological analysis of the kowalevski case ; the union of all trajectories of the especially remarkable motions in the phase space form a critical set of the integral map determining bifurcations of the integral manifolds @xcite ( the rough topology of the liouville foliation ) and exact topological invariants of the problem @xcite .",
    "the appelrot classes received many generalizations in various directions . in @xcite a new integrable case was found for a heavy dynamically symmetric gyrostat ( a rigid body with a rotor characterized by constant gyrostatic momentum @xmath1 ) ; this case includes the bobylev  steklov case and the 4th appelrot class as partial problems under some restrictions on the parameters .",
    "another two exact solutions for a gyrostat with the kowalevski type inertia tensor were found in @xcite .",
    "these solutions cover the 2nd and the 3rd appelrot classes as @xmath1 tends to zero .",
    "after the kowalevski type heavy gyrostat was proved to be completely integrable @xcite , it appeared that the motions pointed out in @xcite form a critical set of the kowalevski ",
    "yehia gyrostat @xcite .",
    "other analogues of the appelrot classes are associated with the problem of the rigid body motion in a _ double force field _",
    "( sometimes referred to as _ two constant fields _ ) .",
    "this field could be , for example , a superposition of the gravity field and the constant magnetic field affecting a heavy magnetized rigid body with a fixed point .",
    "the equations of motion were given by o.i.bogoyavlensky in @xcite and presented as the euler equation on the lie co - algebra @xmath2 .",
    "in the same paper a partial integrable case ( the subsystem with two degrees of freedom ) was found generalizing the 1st appelrot class .",
    "more general system including a double field and a non - zero gyrostatic momentum was proved integrable in @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the generalizations of the 2nd , 3rd and 4th appelrot classes with @xmath3 were discovered in @xcite . for non - zero gyrostatic momentum ,",
    "analogues of the appelrot classes were found in @xcite . in the general case these analogues also form a critical set of the integrable map ; the critical trajectories are organized in almost everywhere hamiltonian systems with less than three degrees of freedom ( so - called critical subsystems ) .",
    "the knowledge of critical subsystems made it possible to obtain many analytical results ( e.g , new separation of variables @xcite , explicit descriptions of periodic motions @xcite ) and to fulfill a number of topological investigations @xcite . on this basis",
    ", the complete description of the topology of the kowalevski top in a double field in terms of net topological invariants was given @xcite .    in 2002 ,",
    "new integrable problems for the kowalevski type gyrostat were found by v.v.sokolov for the case of one axially symmetric field @xcite and by v.v.sokolov and a.v.tsiganov for the case of a double field @xcite .",
    "the last one also generalizes the kowalevski type integrable gyrostat found by a.g.reyman and m.a.semenov-tian-shansky @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the phase topology of the sokolov ",
    "tsiganov case was started in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we obtain the generalized appelrot classes for the case found in @xcite and establish some properties of the appearing invariant manifolds ( critical subsystems with two degrees of freedom ) .",
    "for each subsystem we point out the invariant relations defining its manifold and give a pair of independent first integrals . in terms of these integrals , using the invariant relations we explicitly calculate the types of the corresponding critical points of the integral map .",

    "the collection of results and the relevant references can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kowalevski gyrostat in a double field is also actively studied @xcite .",
    "these investigations are based on the notion of a critical subsystem , i.e. , an even - dimensional invariant submanifold in the phase space consisting of critical points of the integral map .",
    "the idea of a critical subsystem is as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath73 be the integral map of the system and let @xmath74 be the set of its critical points .",
    "obviously , @xmath74 is stratified by @xmath75 and for @xmath76 the number @xmath77 is called the rank of the critical point @xmath78 .",

    "suppose that @xmath81 is the equation of a 2-surface @xmath82 bearing one of the imensional leaves .",
    "let @xmath83 then the critical subsystem @xmath84 ( of rank 2 ) is the closure of the set of critical points of rank  2 belonging to the level @xmath85 ( to the pre - image of @xmath86 ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath84 is an invariant subset in @xmath28 consisting of critical points of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , speaking of a critical subsystem we always have in mind the induced dynamics .",
    "the subset @xmath84 is almost everywhere a 4-dimensional manifold given by the equations @xmath87 and the induced dynamical system on it is almost everywhere hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the global hamiltonian structure may have singularities at the points where either @xmath84 fails to be smooth or the 2-form induced on @xmath84 by the symplectic structure degenerates .",
    "critical subsystems of rank 1 ( with one degree of freedom ) can be obtained in a similar way starting with two equations of the type  .    in analytical case ( particularly , in the case when all functions and equations have polynomial structure ) critical subsystems are defined uniquely if we consider all irreducible equations of the type .",
    "such systems generate a stratification of the phase space and determine bifurcations that occur to the liouville tori .",
    "invariant relations describing a critical subsystem make it possible to explicitly calculate the types of critical points for all ranks .",
    "critical subsystems were found for the kowalevski top in a double field in @xcite and for the kowalevski gyrostat in a double field in @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "one of these subsystems has one degree of freedom and is formed completely by the pendulum type motions . for the top",
    ", there exist three subsystems with two degrees of freedom . for the gyrostat , one of the subsystems ( the bogoyavlensky case ) splits , the parts of the new manifold join the other subsystems . in two of three critical subsystems for the top in a double field the algebraic separation of variables was obtained @xcite .",

    "<S> we point out a commutative pair of independent integrals , describe the sets of degeneration of the induced symplectic structure . with the help of the obtained invariant relations , for each subsystem we calculate the outer type of its points considered as critical points of the initial system with three degrees of freedom .    </S>",
