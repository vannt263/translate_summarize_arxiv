    "the deuteron form factor @xmath2 has been measured at jefferson laboratory and four momentum transfers up to @xmath3 gev@xmath4 @xcite , improving the slac measurements@xcite , and measurements at larger @xmath0 are planned .",
    "these efforts have caused much interest on improving calculations of the form factors at higher values of @xmath0 up to about 11 gev@xmath4 .",
    "the best calculations are elegant in their use of the very latest realistic , high - precision nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "these potentials are based on using detailed knowledge of the long and medium range parts of the potentials and on using artful modeling of the short distance physics .",
    "typically , the parameters of the potentials are tuned to obtain an accurate reproduction of the measured phase shifts up to 300 mev laboratory kinetic energy , @xmath5 . increasing",
    "the range of energies of the validity of the potential should increase the ability of the potential to describe those aspects of the deuteron wave function which enter at high momentum transfer@xcite .",
    "indeed it seems reasonable to expect that describing a form factor at a given momentum transfer , @xmath0 , would require a reproduction of the large angle nn scattering amplitude at @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nucleon mass .",
    "qualitatively this is because the relative momentum , which dominates the overlap integral for the form factor is @xmath8 .",
    "the implication of ( 1 ) is that for @xmath9 gev@xmath4 one needs to use a potential that successfully describes the neutron - proton phase shifts for @xmath10 mev . to our knowledge ,",
    "no such consistency check of the potential used to compute the deuteron wave function has been made .",
    "one might think that a simple kinematic relationship such as eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) might not apply because the nucleons in the deuteron are bound .",
    "therefore we need to demonstrate explicitly that there is a strong relationship between the form factor and the scattering amplitude at large energies and large angles . indeed , the specific result ( see eqs .",
    "( [ kin ] )  ( [ res1 ] ) below ) differs quantitatively from eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "this is obtained using the simplest possible dynamics : non - relativistic spin - less nucleons interacting with an energy - independent local potential . clearly , it is not our purpose to be realistic .",
    "instead we merely wish to point out that , under certain conditions , the form factor can be proportional to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the derivation of the relation between the form factor and the scattering amplitude proceeds in sec .",
    "ii by applying the factorization approximation commonly used in perturbative qcd derivations of hadronic form factors along with the first born approximation expected to be valid at high energies .",
    "the requirements for each approximation are investigated and correction terms obtained .",
    "the accuracy of the approximations and the resulting form factor scattering amplitude relation are studied using simple interactions : attractive coulomb potential and sum of attractive and repulsive square wells in sect .",
    "iii , and some implications for other models are discussed . a detailed numerical study using the malfliet - tjon potential",
    "is made in sect .",
    "iv . the specific approximations used in sect .",
    "ii appear to be marginally successful , if the potential obtains a total weak attraction by combining strong repulsion at short distances with strong attraction at larger distances .",
    "therefore , a more general argument , using only the schroedinger equation , is presented in sect .",
    "v. a discussion of the implications of our results is presented in sect .",
    "the reader may immediately question the use of non - relativistic dynamics , because many specific relativistic effects are known .",
    "for a recent review , see ref .",
    ". however , such dynamics are not irrelevant at @xmath11 mev .",
    "furthermore , the use of relativistic light front dynamics shows that relativistic dynamics is not very different from non - relativistic dynamics : two - nucleons dominate , there is a wave equation , and the specific relativistic effects in the deuteron are not very large unless @xmath0 is very high .",
    "the specific differences between the non - relativistic and light - front approaches are relatively well - understood and lead to a small easing of the constraint ( [ limit ] ) for @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we turn to the necessary derivation without further apology .",
    "the deuteron wave function @xmath13 is defined by the schroedinger equation : ( p^22+v)=-_b , [ psi ] where @xmath14 . the form factor is given in terms of the momentum - space wave function as f(q)=d^3p ( p)()f(q)=d^3p ( p ) ( ) .[fff]in the widely - employed breit frame @xmath15 . for large enough values of @xmath16 , and for a potential ( expressed in momentum space ) that which decreases as a power of q ,",
    "the integral may be simplified because @xmath16 can be much larger than the typical values of @xmath17 for which the wave function is near its largest value .",
    "the deuteron wave function is known to have a limited momentum content , being essentially 0 for momenta greater than about 600 mev / c .",
    "we aim for a simplification of eq .",
    "( [ fff ] ) that is valid at large momentum transfer .",
    "the basic assumption is that , for large enough values of @xmath16 , one can regard @xmath18 even though the integral extends over all values of @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to the factorization approximation commonly used in perturbative qcd calculations of hadronic form factors .",
    "a pedagogic discussion of the technique we employ is presented in ref .",
    "there are two regions for which the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ fff ] ) is largest : @xmath19 for which the first wave function is large , and @xmath20 for which the second wave function is large .",
    "the regions contribute equally so that we may say f(q^2)f_a(q^2)= 2(q/2)d^3p(p)[fff1 ] , with the integral over all momentum being proportional to the coordinate space wave function evaluated at the origin : ( r=0)=(p )",
    ".    one may also derive ( [ fff1 ] ) using coordinate space arguments and determine the leading correction term . by regarding @xmath21 one finds @xcite the approximate form factor and its leading correction term : & & f(q)=d^3p ( p ) ( r)(i ( + /2 ) ) ) + & & d^3p ( p)(r)(1-p^2r^2/6 ) + & & f_a(q^2)-(2)^3/2 ^ 2(r=0)_q^26(q).[cap]if the integrals exist , and if the wave functions fall as a power of @xmath16 , the ratio of the second to the first terms of eq .",
    "( cap ) is proportional to @xmath22 which vanishes for sufficiently large values of @xmath23 .    according to eq .",
    "( fff1 ) , the momentum transfer dependence of the form factor is obtained from the wave function @xmath24 , for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 .",
    "thus we attempt to obtain @xmath25 from the momentum space version of eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) : ( q/2)=1-_b - q^28d^3p v(p).[ls]we again use the idea that @xmath16 can be much greater than @xmath17 , so that the wave function @xmath26 can be approximated as ( q/2 ) vd^3p(p)=-8q^2 v(2)^32(r=0 ) .[appr]this approximation seems very natural , if one is used to the ideas of perturbative qcd .",
    "in particular , the entire momentum transfer is taken up by a single action of the potential , so that the important positions in coordinate space region are those for which the potential has its greatest variation .",
    "it is useful to examine eq .",
    "( appr ) from the view of coordinate space .",
    "one has d^3p v(p)= ( -i/2))v(r)(r).one may now observe that the approximation eq .",
    "( appr ) relies on replacing the product @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "this is allowed only if the potential has a much more significant variation than the wave function for positions near the origin .",
    "the expression eq .",
    "( appr ) can be used to obtain the form factor from eq .",
    "( [ fff ] ) .",
    "the result is f_b(q^2)(-16q^2 ) v ^2,[res ] + d^3p ( p).the approximation ( [ res ] ) has been verified numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the semi - realistic hulthn model .",
    "the content of eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) is that the form factor is proportional to the square of the bound state wave function at the origin times the fourier transform of the potential : v=1(2)^3d^3r e^i2 * q*v(r ) + = 4(2)^3r^2 dr qr v(r ) .",
    "the desired relation between the form factor and the scattering amplitude can be obtained by realizing that at energies e much greater than the characteristic strength of the potential , the first born approximation is valid and the scattering amplitude for a cm angle @xmath29 , @xmath30 is also a fourier transform of the potential .",
    "the validity of the first born approximation , at high energies , for energy - dependent local potentials , is well - verified in many quantum mechanics textbooks . in that case ,",

    "the key point is that the form factor is expressed as the high - energy scattering amplitude times well - defined factors , implying that a correct calculation for the form factor can only be achieved in models in which the scattering amplitude is accurately reproduced .",
    "the arguments used in the previous section are analogous to those presented in derivations of qcd factorization theorems .",
    "however , these have not been used often for nuclear targets .",

    "it is well known that , for the coulomb interaction , this approximation reproduces the exact scattering cross section . however , the correct scattering amplitude is complex , while the approximation eq .",
    "( born ) gives a real result .",
    "thus the condition that eq .",

    "this is the condition that @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 , one needs only @xmath44 .",
    "thus the approximations of the previous section are easily satisfied for dynamics defined by the coulomb potential . more generally , it is reasonable to expect that , if the potential is local , purely attractive with a significant gradient at the origin and magnitude determined by the very small deuteron binding energy ( 2.2 mev ) , the approximations needed to reach the form factor scattering amplitude relation ( [ res1 ] ) are well satisfied . in such cases , the potential varies more rapidly than the wave function for positions near the origin , and the potential is weak enough so that the first born approximation can be accurate for reasonable momentum transfers .",
    "the nuclear force is repulsive at short distances and attractive at long distances between nucleons .",

    "<S> a non - relativistic potential - model version of the factorization assumption , used in perturbative qcd calculations of hadronic form factors , is used , along with the born approximation valid at high energies , to derive a remarkably simple relationship between the impulse approximation contribution to the deuteron form factor at high momentum transfer and the high energy neutron - proton scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the relation states that the form factor at a given value of @xmath0 is proportional to the scattering amplitude at a specific energy and scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that an accurate computation of the form factors at large @xmath0 requires a simultaneous description of the phase - shifts at a related energy , a statement that seems reasonable regardless of any derivation . our form factor - scattering amplitude relation is shown to be accurate for some examples . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the potential consists of a strong short distance repulsive term and a strong longer ranged attractive term , as typically occurs in many realistic potentials , the relation is found to be accurate only for ridiculously large values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> more general arguments , using only the schroedinger equation , suggest a strong , but complicated , relationship between the form factor and scattering amplitude . </S>",
