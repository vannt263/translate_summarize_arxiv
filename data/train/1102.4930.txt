    "relaying is receiving attention for wireless cellular applications because it improves rates and reliabilities .",
    "there are two simple geometric scenarios that give insight into relaying strategies , and that show how relaying achieves distributed multi - input , multi - output ( mimo ) gains  @xcite .",
    "first , relays that are close to a source node can achieve  multi - input \" gains by using a decode - forward ( df ) strategy .",
    "second , relays that are close to a destination node can achieve  multi - output \" gains by using a compress - forward ( cf ) strategy .",
    "both the df and cf strategies appeared for abstract channels in the work of cover and el gamal  @xcite .",
    "this document focuses on the cf strategy whose usefulness for network communication has been demonstrated . , e.g. , in  @xcite and follow - up works .",
    "recently , a method called _ noisy network coding _ was developed  @xcite that is a quantize - forward ( qf ) variant of the cf strategy .",
    "the qf strategy uses simple relays and achieves a remarkably simple - to - describe rate region that is sometimes close to a cut - set upper bound .",
    "our main goal is to outline why the short - message cf method of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "v ) can achieve better rates and reliabilities with less complexity than the long - message qf methods of  @xcite .",
    "this extends results by wu and xie  @xcite who found that short - message encoding achieves the same rates as long - message encoding for a single source .",
    "finally , we describe a hashing scheme that combines some of the advantages of long- and short - message encoding .",
    "we first address terminology . variations of the compression strategy of cover and el gamal  @xcite are known by names such as  estimate - forward \" ( ef ) ,  compress - forward \" ( cf ) ,  quantize - forward \" ( qf ) ,  quantize - map \" ,  hash - forward \" ( hf ) , and so forth .",
    "we make the following observations .    *",
    "the word  compress \" is a generic name that refers to both lossless and lossy source coding , the latter including  quantization \" and  hashing \" ( or  binning \" ) . * without hashing one obtains a qf strategy  @xcite . * without quantization one obtains a hf strategy  @xcite . *",
    "the name of a relay function should not depend on the choice of operations at other nodes .",
    "in particular , it should not depend on whether other nodes perform optimal or suboptimal processing .",
    "the last bullet point sometimes causes confusion .",
    "some literature takes cf to mean that the  next \" relay along a route _ must decode _ certain indices , perhaps even with a suboptimal decoder .",
    "however , if one accepts this bullet point , such terminology makes little sense .",
    "we therefore advocate to use the ( generic ) name cf for the general strategy , hf for a strategy without quantization , and qf for a strategy without hashing .",
    "of course , this makes hf and qf ( and noisy network coding ) special cases of cf .",
    "we review the recent qf strategy , see  @xcite .",
    "however , rather than using long - message repetition encoding we use  short \"- message encoding ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "v ) ,  @xcite ) and pipelined decoding via a sliding - window method ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "i.a ) ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , ) . as usual",
    ", we use independent random codebooks for each block ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "we use the notation @xmath0 and @xmath1 for @xmath2-typical sets .    _ code construction _ : encoding is performed in @xmath3 blocks , and we generate a different code book for each block ( see  [ fig : relay1-compressforward ] where @xmath4 ) . for block @xmath5 , @xmath6 , generate @xmath7 codewords @xmath8 , @xmath9 , by choosing the symbols @xmath10 , @xmath11 , independently using @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , generate @xmath13 codewords @xmath14 , @xmath15 , by choosing the @xmath16 independently using @xmath17 .",

    "_ relay _ : in block  @xmath31 , the relay transmits @xmath32 .",
    "after block @xmath5 , the relay has seen @xmath33 .",
    "the relay tries to find a @xmath34 such that @xmath35 if one or more such @xmath34 are found , then the relay chooses one of them , sets @xmath36 , and transmits @xmath37 . if no such pair is found , the relay sets @xmath38 and transmits @xmath39",
    ".    _ sink terminal _ :",

    "the relay quantization requires @xmath48 2 .",
    "the sink s decoder can be viewed as a multi - access channel ( mac ) decoder for two messages @xmath49 and @xmath50 and therefore we have the bounds @xmath51 observe that we _ can not _ ignore the bound , as might be expected , because we require that @xmath45 in .",
    "the sums in and are due to the intersection of independent events and .    the joint distribution of the random variables factors as @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "performing a fourier - motzkin elimination of @xmath54 , and manipulating the mutual information expressions , the bounds - become @xmath55 but suppose that is not satisfied so that and give @xmath56 which is a stronger bound than .",
    "the rates satisfying are achievable with qf , e.g. , by choosing @xmath18 independent of @xmath57 and @xmath19 ( and thus @xmath58 also ) .",
    "hence we may ignore the constraint .",
    "the resulting qf rates are as close as desired to the known cf rate @xmath59 \\label{eq : cfrate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the maximization is over all distributions factoring as in .",
    "the rate is the same as the more commonly used expression ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 3 and eq . ( 6 ) ) )",
    "one may decode short - message encoded packets by using backward decoding ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) as long as the final transmission block is sufficiently long to be able to decode @xmath61 .",
    "the bound is replaced with the weaker constraint @xmath62 which means that is replaced with the weaker constraint @xmath63 we thus find that backward decoding should outperform pipelined decoding for slow - fading channels with outage .",
    "another possibility is for the receiver to jointly decode all indices after transmission is completed .",
    "yet another possibility is to use a pipelined decoder with a longer and variable window length , either in the forward or backward directions .",
    "for example , the window length may be @xmath5 for block @xmath5 .",
    "one advantage of long - message encoding is that the quantization constraint disappears ( which means that disappears ) .",
    "thus , long - message encoding should outperform short - message encoding for slow - fading channels with outage .      as mentioned in the introduction , relaying achieves distributed mimo gains if relays close to a source use df and relays far from a source use cf / qf  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , long - message encoding inhibits df because the message is usually too long to decode after receiving one block of channel outputs .",
    "in contrast , short - message encoding lets relays close to a source decode messages early .",
    "these relays can form a distributed transmit array with this source .",
    "a subtle advantage of short messages is that one can map a small number of bits onto the modulation , i.e. , the modulation set can be kept small .",
    "when using long - message encoding , one would either have to use a ( very ) large modulation set , or one must first hash the long message to a shorter message ( see below ) . either way , long - message decoding is complex and will suffer implementation and synchronization losses if a large modulation alphabet is used .",
    "short - message encoding has a considerably - reduced _ encoding _ delay as compared to long - message encoding .",
    "similarly , pipelined decoding enjoys a considerably - reduced _ decoding _ delay .",
    "the combination of these two approaches might support streaming applications .",
    "we may combine the reliability advantage of long - message encoding with the early decoding and modulation complexity advantages of short messages by hashing the long message to many short messages before transmission .",
    "relays may now decode short hash messages if they can , thereby enabling df and distributed mimo .",
    "furthermore , the quantization constraints such as disappear like for long - message encoding .",
    "the price paid is long encoding and decoding delays .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , short - message encoding and backward decoding achieves the same bounds on @xmath64 as in  @xcite for multiple relays .",
    "this statement is also valid for multiple relays and multiple sources .",
    "the knowledgable reader may wonder why hashing ( or binning ) is not needed to achieve the cf rates , in seeming contradiction to results in , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "of course , one obvious explanation is that we are using a better ( joint ) decoder rather than a step - by - step decoder .",
    "however , the model of  @xcite deserves closer inspection .",
    "the relay channel in  @xcite does not have the  standard \" form with a memoryless channel @xmath65 ; there is instead a rate constraint @xmath66 on the relay - destination link .",
    "but we can bring such a channel into standard form by introducing a random variable @xmath57 that represents the relay s transmit symbols and choose its alphabet size @xmath67 as @xmath68 ( if @xmath68 is not an integer we may choose a model with memory on the relay - destinaton link and again appropriately limit the size of the input alphabet ) .",
    "now suppose that @xmath69 in which case qf necessarily assigns the same codeword @xmath70 to ( exponentially in @xmath71 ) many indices @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , qf implicitly performs hashing .",
    "the same consideration shows that wyner - ziv coding may be considered to be using qf only ( without a binning step ) .",
    "a similar claim can be made for slepian - wolf coding .",
    "of course , this statement lacks depth since whether we call implicit binning qf or hf is not important .",
    "the reader may now wonder whether qf always performs hashing implicitly .",
    "we emphasize that this is generally _ not _ the case when @xmath72 .",
    "for example , for real - input channels such as gaussian channels we have @xmath73 and qf will generally assign a unique @xmath70 to every index @xmath50 .",
    "for the single - relay channel , short - message qf with pipelined decoding achieves the same rates as long - message qf . for the multi - relay ,",
    "multi - source channel , short - message qf with backward decoding recovers the rates of long - message qf .",
    "several advantages of short - message encoding are pointed out , e.g. , substantial reduction in delay , reduced modulation complexity , and added flexibility in letting relays choose df or cf ( or qf ) .",
