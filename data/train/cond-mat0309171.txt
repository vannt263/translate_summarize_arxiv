    "the role of the electron - phonon coupling in the high @xmath4 cuprates remains a puzzle .",
    "the initial finding of the absence of a phonon signature in the temperature dependence of the resistivity@xcite and the small size of the isotope effect in the optimally doped cuprates@xcite suggested that the electron - phonon interaction played a relatively unimportant role in these strongly - correlated materials .",
    "however , large isotope effects away from optimal doping,@xcite significant phonon renormalization induced in the superconducting state,@xcite and recent interpretations of arpes data@xcite continue to raise questions regarding the nature and role of the electron - phonon interaction in the high @xmath4 cuprates .",
    "one point of view is that the effects of the strong coulomb interaction act to suppress the electron - phonon interaction and that while the electron - lattice interaction enters the problem , it does so on a secondary level coming along as it were for the ride .",
    "for example , in this view the large isotope effects observed in some of the cuprates away from optimal doping arises from the influence of the lattice on stripe fluctuations , acting to stabilize these and thus suppressing superconductivity.@xcite similarly , the superconductivity - induced phonon renormalization and the possible englesberg - schrieffer@xcite signature in the arpes data could be interpreted as naturally occurring in an interacting system but having little effect on the underlying superconducting pairing mechanism .",
    "alternatively one might interpret the isotope effect and the phonon renormalization as supporting the existence of a significant electron - phonon coupling .",
    "furthermore , arpes measurements have been specifically interpreted in terms of phonon modes that could drive @xmath1 pairing.@xcite here , we analyze a simple model of an electron - phonon interaction with the goal of obtaining insight into what one expects to see in the arpes data of a @xmath1 superconductor with electron - phonon interactions .",
    "continuing technological advances along with improved sample quality have allowed angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) to probe details of the energy and momentum structure of the one - electron excitations in the cuprate materials.@xcite although simplified , the sudden approximation leads to a useful picture in which the arpes intensity is equal to the square of a matrix element which depends upon the photon energy , polarization , and the sample geometry times a product of the single particle spectral weight @xmath5 and a fermi factor @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the one - electron green s function .",
    "thus , the idea is that from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 dependence of the arpes data , one can extract information about the spectral weight @xmath0 .",
    "then , from this , one seeks to learn about the electron self - energy @xmath10 and the structure of the effective interaction .",
    "in particular , the role of spin fluctuations and the @xmath2-resonance on the superconducting state spectral function have been studied.@xcite with the recent suggestions@xcite from arpes measurements that there may be a significant coupling of the electrons to a phonon with an energy of order 40mev , one would like to understand how this would effect the arpes spectrum .    from the number of atoms in a unit cell ,",
    "it is clear that there are a large number of phonon modes in the cuprates . here",
    "we will focus on several of the modes associated with the motion of the o ions .",
    "we will treat these as einstein phonons .",
    "then for a hubbard - like model in which the cu sites form the hubbard lattice , the effective electron - electron interaction is @xmath11 if @xmath12 is independent of the momentum transfer , @xmath13 does not couple to the @xmath1-pairing channel .",
    "this could model the coupling to the @xmath14-axis vibration of the apical oxygen .",
    "alternatively , if the electron - phonon matrix element is momentum dependent , the interaction given by eq .   can couple to the @xmath1-pairing channel .",
    "the possibility that an electron - phonon interaction could give rise to @xmath15-wave pairing has been discussed by various authors.@xcite in one approach , the @xmath15-wave pairing interaction occurs as the result of the interplay of the o half - breathing mode and the exchange interaction.@xcite other approaches suggest that the coulomb interaction can lead to a peaking of the electron - phonon coupling at small momentum transfers which favors @xmath1 pairing.@xcite this type of momentum dependence also occurs directly for certain phonon modes .",
    "for example , for the cu - o - cu buckling - like mode@xcite the square of the electron - phonon coupling constant is @xmath16 setting @xmath17 , the momentum - dependent part of this coupling factors into a sum of separable terms @xmath18 including additional @xmath19 and @xmath20 factors .",
    "the plus sign in front of the @xmath15-wave term implies that this type of phonon exchange provides an attractive channel for @xmath15-wave pairing .",
    "the key point is that if the electron - phonon coupling @xmath21 falls off at large @xmath22 momentum transfers , then such a phonon exchange can mediate @xmath15-wave pairing .",
    "alternatively , an in - plane o breathing - like mode has @xmath23 this increases at large momentum transfers giving rise to a repulsive interaction in the @xmath1-channel . setting @xmath17 in eq .",
    "one finds that @xmath24 and the minus sign in the second term implies that this phonon suppresses @xmath15-wave pairing.@xcite    in section ii we discuss the simplified case of a cylindrical fermi surface and a separable phonon mediated interaction .",
    "this provides insight into the differences between the @xmath25-wave and @xmath15-wave cases and establishes the structure of the singularities in the self - energy that are reflected in @xmath0 for an einstein mode .",
    "while in the actual materials , the singularities are broadened by the dispersion of the phonon mode , quasiparticle lifetime effects due to other interactions and impurities , as well as finite temperature effects , these results provide a useful framework for understanding the structure that appears in @xmath0 .    in section iii , we include the effects of a @xmath26 band structure and the momentum dependence of the coupling .",
    "we consider the three different electron - phonon coupling constants discussed above and compare these with the response to the @xmath2-resonance spin fluctuation mode .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath2-resonance mode has been extensively discussed in refs .",
    "various estimates for the strength of the @xmath2-resonance - electron coupling have been made.@xcite here , we chose this coupling so that the renormalization of the nodal fermi velocity is comparable with that obtained for the phonon coupling .",
    "then we compare and discuss the spectral weights for the various modes .",
    "section iv contains a summary of the results and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we consider the case of a cylindrical fermi surface and an interaction arising from the exchange of an einstein phonon of frequency @xmath27 @xmath28 here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote different @xmath8 vectors on the cylindrical fermi surface . with eq .   in mind , we will take @xmath31 to have the separable form @xmath32 the one - electron green s function can be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 the renormalization parameter and @xmath36 the gap parameter .",

    "results for both the arpes accessible region @xmath75 and the inverse photoemission region @xmath76 are shown .",
    "the shift of spectral weight due to the quasiparticle coherence factors @xmath77 is clearly seen as is the englesberg - schrieffer signature showing the asymptotic approach of a peak in the spectral function to @xmath62 . because of the square root singularity in @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the asymptotic approach of this peak to @xmath69 varies as @xmath80 .",
    "in addition , @xcite the fermi velocity is renormalized by @xmath81 so that the dispersion of the peak for @xmath9 near @xmath74 varies as @xmath82 while for @xmath9 large compared to @xmath27 , a broadened quasiparticle peak disperses as @xmath83 .",
    "energy distribution curves ( edc ) showing @xmath0 versus @xmath9 for various values of @xmath83 are shown in fig .  3 for @xmath75 .",
    "this is the type of edc that one would expect to see for a traditional @xmath25-wave electron - phonon superconductor with a single dominant einstein mode.@xcite more generally , one would have multiple phonon modes and their dispersion along with possible finite temperature effects would lead to a richer response .",
    "intensity plots of @xmath0 for the case of a @xmath1 gap are shown in fig .",
    "4 . just as for the @xmath25-wave case , @xmath84 is supplemented so that the gap at the gap edge is @xmath85 .",
    "4(a ) shows @xmath0 for a cut along the antinodal direction in @xmath8-space @xmath86 , while fig .",
    "4(b ) shows the results for a cut along the nodal direction @xmath87 .",
    "the antinodal cut resembles the @xmath25-wave case in the transfer of spectral weight as @xmath83 passes through the fermi energy and the renormalization of the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "however , the englesberg - schrieffer signature no longer asymptotically approaches @xmath62 , but rather appears to be broadened and cut off . in the @xmath25-wave case , the broadening due to the electron - phonon interaction",
    "did not set in until @xmath88 exceeded @xmath89 leading to the long sweep of the peak which occurs for @xmath88 just below @xmath90 .",
    "however , the nodal regions associated with a @xmath1 gap lead to a finite broadening when @xmath88 exceeds @xmath27 . the onset of this broadening is seen by the faint horizontal line in fig .  4 where the intensity changes from black to blue at larger values of @xmath83 .",
    "as we will discuss , termination of this peak is a reflection of the fact that for a @xmath1-gap , @xmath68 and @xmath67 have step discontinuities at @xmath69 rather than the square root singularities associated with an @xmath25-wave gap .",
    "the nodal cut , shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , appears on first glance to be similar to what one would expect for the normal state .",
    "that is , a renormalized @xmath91 dispersion for @xmath92 with the dispersion returning to its band value @xmath83 for @xmath93 .",
    "however , the cut - off englesberg - schrieffer signature still occurs for @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the full antinodal gap @xmath74 enters as the characteristic kink energy for all momentum slices .",
    "this simply reflects the @xmath95 singularities in @xmath78 and @xmath79 shown in fig .  1 .",
    "again , the broadening of the englesberg - schrieffer peak when @xmath88 exceeds @xmath27 is clearly seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) . in fig .  5 ,",
    "various edc slices of @xmath0 are shown for the @xmath1 case .",
    "comparing these with the @xmath25-wave case , one sees the broadening and truncation of the englesberg - schrieffer lower peak .",
    "the difference in the structure of the englesberg - schrieffer signature between the @xmath25- and the @xmath1-cases can be understood from the plots of @xmath96 shown in fig .",
    "one can see that as one probes @xmath83 states which are further below the fermi energy , two solutions of eq .   develops .",
    "for the @xmath25-wave case shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 , an undamped lower energy branch asymptotically approaches @xmath97 , and a second quasiparticle branch at @xmath98 evolves which is damped by the imaginary parts of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . as we have seen , these branches are reflected in the structure of @xmath0 and the lower energy branch represents the characteristic englesberg - schrieffer signature for an @xmath25-wave superconductor .",
    "similar plots for the @xmath1-case with @xmath99 and @xmath100 are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 . here , unlike the @xmath25-wave case",
    ", the low energy branch is terminated , reflecting the fact that the singularities in @xmath68 and @xmath67 for the @xmath15-wave case are simply step discontinuities at @xmath64 .",
    "the onset of damping processes for the @xmath1 case when @xmath101 give rise to the discontinuity in slope seen at @xmath102 .",
    "we turn next to the effects of the band structure and to the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon coupling . for the band structure , consider a square lattice with a near - neighbor hopping @xmath103 and a next - near - neighbor hopping @xmath104 . in this case",
    "@xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , one has the typical fermi surface shown in fig .  7 and the single spin electron density of states shown in the inset .",
    "we take the gap to be @xmath108 in this case , the one - electron green s function can be written in the form @xmath109 adopting the same approximation as before , the phonon - induced contributions to the imaginary parts of the renormalization , energy shift , and gap parameters are given by    @xmath110    @xmath111    @xmath112    here , as before , we assume that an underlying pairing interaction , most likely spin - fluctuations , gives rise to a zero temperature @xmath1 superconducting state . at low energies this state is characterized by a renormalized band structure eq .   and chemical potential , a renormalized coupling constant @xmath113 , and a gap given by eq .  .",
    "these parameters have been used in the eliashberg equations to describe the state which enters when an excitation at energy @xmath114 decays to a lower energy @xmath115 state ( or when @xmath116 decays to @xmath117 ) .",
    "the real parts of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 are again found from the kramer - kronig dispersion relation .",
    "the spectral weight @xmath0 is then obtained from eq .   with the chemical potential shift removed from @xmath121 and",
    "a contribution added to the real part of the gap so that the real part of the gap at the gap edge remains equal to @xmath122 , eq .  .",
    "note that the contributions of the underlying pairing interaction to @xmath78 and @xmath123 , as well as the higher energy part of @xmath79 , have not been included .",
    "thus , there are additional renormalization and damping effects which do not appear",
    ". we basically are seeking to understand the leading contribution of the electron - phonon interaction which is superimposed on top of the other many - body interactions .",
    "this approach rests on the idea that in the superconducting state the low - lying electronic states are well described by bcs @xmath1 excitations @xcite with renormalized band parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath124 , a @xmath1-wave gap @xmath122 , and renormalized electron - phonon coupling constants .",
    "note , that here we are not taking into account the possible change in @xmath125-dependence of the electron - phonon couplings produced for example by the hubbard @xmath126.@xcite    we begin by looking at the self - energy terms for the case of the buckling mode with @xmath127 given by eq .   and @xmath128 in units of @xmath129 .",
    "results for @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 are shown in fig .  8 for @xmath8 at point @xmath133 shown in fig .  7 .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath78 and @xmath79 exhibit the expected log singularity at @xmath134 that we previously saw for the case of a circular fermi surface .",
    "in addition , there is a second log singularity at @xmath135 with @xmath136 which comes from the van hove singularity@xcite at @xmath137 .",
    "these log singularities in @xmath71 and @xmath70 manifest themselves via the kramers - kronig dispersion relation as step - down discontinuities in @xmath68 and @xmath67 , as seen in fig .",
    "the energy shift parameter @xmath123 has only the van hove singularity .",
    "naturally , the dispersion of the phonon mode as well as finite temperature and lifetime effects will broaden these features in the actual system .",

    "eschrig and norman@xcite have analyzed the effect of the @xmath2-resonance using a detailed tight binding fit of the band energy @xmath83 and a coupling to the @xmath2-resonant mode of frequency @xmath27 given by @xmath141}. \\label{twentytwo}\\ ] ] here , we will use the @xmath26 band structure of eq .   with @xmath106 and @xmath142 , set @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and set @xmath145 which corresponds to having @xmath146 in an effective hubbard rpa interaction .",
    "in addition , with this choice for @xmath147 we will find that @xmath148 at the nodal point @xmath149 is comparable with @xmath148 for the phonons .",
    "this makes it convenient for addressing the question of whether there are significant spectral differences due simply to the structure of the momentum - dependent couplings that would allow one to determine the nature of the mode from the arpes data .",

    "11 , one can now move deep enough inside the fermi sea that the englesberg - schrieffer lower energy peak ( the upper bright curve in the figures ) is broadened when @xmath9 becomes less than @xmath158 and terminated at a finite value of @xmath159 as @xmath9 approaches @xmath160 . at still higher energies ( @xmath9 more negative ) , a damped quasiparticle branch is seen .",

    "thus , the characteristic energies @xmath74 , @xmath89 , and @xmath140 are the same .",
    "in addition as discussed , we have chosen the coupling constants so that @xmath127 averaged over the brilloin zone is the same for all four cases .",
    "thus , the basic difference is the momentum structure of the different couplings shown in fig .  13 for @xmath166 . here",
    ", we see that the spin - fluctuation resonant mode is clearly most strongly peaked at large momentum , followed by the breathing mode phonon , the uniform holstein coupling , and lastly the buckling mode phonon which has @xmath167 .",
    "one consequence of the strong peak in the magnetic reasonance - mode coupling is seen in fig .",
    "10 for the @xmath133 cut . here ,",
    "the increase of the intensity of the spectral weight @xmath0 which occurs when @xmath9 decreases below @xmath168 is greatest for the spin - fluctuation @xmath2-resonance and smallest for the buckling mode .    in fig .",
    "14 we show the energy distribution curves for the four modes for momentum @xmath169 .",
    "@xmath0 for all of the modes shows a strong peak at @xmath74 . for the @xmath2-mode , this",
    "is followed by a dip and then a secondary peak which develops as @xmath9 decreases below the van hove threshold at @xmath170 .",
    "it is this peak - dip - hump structure , for the case in which the effects of the bilayer splitting can be eliminated , that has been identified as a ` fingerprint ' of the @xmath2-resonance.@xcite here , we see that indeed this structure is most pronounced for the @xmath2-mode and smallest for the buckling mode",
    ". however , this is a quantitative effect rather than a qualitative one and if the phonon coupling increases at large momentum transfers , such as in the case of the breathing mode , this feature returns although not as strongly as for the @xmath2-mode .",
    "the englesberg - schrieffer - like structure in the arpes data of bisco is consistent with the existence of an einstein - like mode with @xmath171mev coupled to the electrons as suggested by various authors .",
    "@xcite however , it seems that it will be difficult to determine the origin of the mode based solely upon the @xmath172 momentum dependence of its coupling .",
    "one might have thought that the @xmath125-dependence of the coupling or in the case of the @xmath2 mode , the @xmath125-dependence of the resonance that has been parameterized as a @xmath125-dependent coupling , would give rise to clearly identifiable structure in @xmath0 .",
    "however , all of the modes show quite similar characteristic features at energies @xmath89 and @xmath140 , which appear throughout the zone .",
    "it would appear that the best place to look for a feature that could distinguish between , for example , the buckling phonon mode and the @xmath2-resonant mode is near the @xmath169 point . here , the strong coupling of the @xmath2 mode to the electrons for @xmath125 near @xmath173 leads to a secondary peak onsetting at an energy @xmath174 .",
    "for the buckling phonon mode , the coupling at @xmath175 vanishes and there is only a relatively weak response in this same frequency range .",
    "however , as we have seen , there is a secondary peak for the breathing mode which has nearly the same strength as that for the @xmath2-mode .",
    "thus , the observed peak - dip - hump structure could also be consistent with a coupling to the oxygen - breathing mode .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the @xmath176 dependence for a bilayer system may identify the mode as having @xmath177 , which would provide support for the @xmath2 resonance.@xcite however , further work on the odd and even bilayer phonon coupling is needed for comparison .    while the coupling to the @xmath2-resonance mode along with a higher energy continuum spin - fluctuation spectrum provides an attractive unified framework",
    ", our results leave open the possibility that an oxygen phonon mode could also play a role . as we have seen , even with a relatively modest coupling constant @xmath178 , one would expect to see evidence of some oxygen phonon modes .",
    "if they are not seen , then this suggests that the strong coulomb many - body effects act to suppress the electron - phonon coupling . alternatively ,",
    "if it can be shown that the @xmath2-mode is not viable , oxygen phonon modes could provide a source for the resonant mode features .",
    "the continuum spin fluctuations would , of course , also contribute in this mixed scenerio . here",
    "we should note that even if the mode were identified as the buckling mode , we find that its contribution to the magnitude of the @xmath1 gap is negligible because the increase in @xmath68 more than offsets the increase in @xmath67 ( in eq .",
    "the @xmath15-wave coupling term is only 1/4 of the uniform coupling ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of eliashberg - like @xmath4 calculations @xcite which find that , while the buckling phonons can provide an attraction in the @xmath1-channel , its contribution to @xmath78 leads to an overall reduction in @xmath4 .",
    "to conclude , from the results that we have found , it seems likely that the identification of the excitation responsible for the structure in the arpes data will be decided on grounds other than the momentum dependence of the effective coupling .",
    "one aspect that remains under discussion is the strength of the various couplings . for the o phonon modes ,",
    "lda calculations @xcite find intermediate coupling strengths with @xmath179 to 0.5 . from our calculations",
    "it would appear that at this strength , one should in fact see structure in @xmath0 .",
    "if this is not seen , it raises the question of why is the electron - phonon coupling weakened in strongly - correlated materials ?",
    "@xcite the coupling to the @xmath2-resonance mode would appear to raise the opposite problem .",
