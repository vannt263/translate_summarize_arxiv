    "@xcite the quantum dynamical tunneling of ultra cold atoms between classical islands of stability was also reported ; this shows that the presence of chaos in phase - space can yield substantial consequences on the quantum tunneling rate between classical regular regions , an effect that has since become known as chaos - assisted tunneling @xcite .    spatial light modulation to study chaotic dynamics of cold atoms has also been implemented in the context of optical billiards . to create an optical billiard ,",

    "this occurs both in the tight binding regime ( similar to an optical billiard ) and in the case that initial conditions allow the atomic transport between different potential wells .",

    "[ part1]b . in fig .",
    "[ part2 ] , we illustrate the type of trajectories with major frequency in the distribution of @xmath71 . in this interesting case , we observe the presence of two kind of partial trajectories that go across the lobe entering through one boundary and going out through the same boundary ; just one of them almost arrives to the second boundary .",
    "the other class of trajectories has a non negligible probability of being followed by an almost identical trajectory under reflection when the atom crosses to the other lobe .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ part2]b where consecutive partial trajectories of this kind lead to a partial trajectory very similar to the quasiperiodic case shown in fig .",
    "[ cuasi123]c .",
    "we have numerically shown that optical lattices with transverse structure allow the design of potentials yielding non trivial dynamics . for chaotic trajectories , like the one shown in figure [ chaotic123]c , the atom has a non zero probability to be found at any point within its accessible region of phase space .",
    "this behavior is similar to that expected for the quantum description of the atom motion . in this case",
    "the atom wave function will necessarily lead to a position probability density that mimics the optical structure , being non zero in any of the lobes .",
    "we expect that for ultra cold atoms chaos - assisted bidimensional tunneling will take place .    under the proposed set - up",
    ", one can notice that the fraction of trapped atoms with chaotic trajectories diminishes as the irradiance is lowered , fig .",
    "[ percent ] .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that , for intermediate values of the irradiance , most of the trapped chaotic trajectories involve more than one lobe and that the distribution of time permanencies within a lobe is highly structured and with a long tail .",
    "finally , for high irradiances , the proportion of chaotic trajectories saturates and there is a high presence of quasiperiodic trajectories . in this last regime ,",
    "the atom is highly confined in the @xmath0-direction and tends to move inside a single optical potential lobe . since the detuning is large , dissipative effects are expected to be small , thus , in the high intensity regime , the system dynamics is very similar to that of two - dimensional billiards with a topology determined by the parabolic symmetry of the light beam .",
    "it is known@xcite that this kind of dynamical systems have a large set of quasiperiodic solutions .",
    "we consider this the key to understand the saturation effect illustrated in fig .",
    "[ percent ] .",
    "notice that the use of a propagation invariant em wave is not mandatory for the qualitative results we found .",
    "the use of other beams like the gaussian parabolic are expected to yield similar results for the transverse motion of atoms in the focusing plane .",
    "we also assumed anisotropic initial velocities .",
    "if the mean initial z - velocity were comparable with the transverse velocities , one would expect that the atoms motion would take place in multiple quasi bidimensional configuration spaces since the atom would visit several of the sinusoidal potential wells in the z - direction .",
    "however , the projection of the trajectories in a given transversal plane would be expected to be qualitatively similar to those described above .    for the geometries we are studying , blue detuned beams , due to the numerous routes of escape provided by the dark light zones , in general do not lead to trapped trajectories .",
    "nevertheless this scattering process deserves a detailed study on its own , both classically and quantum mechanically .",
