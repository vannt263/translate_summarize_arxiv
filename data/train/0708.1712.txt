    "in the last decade or so remarkable progress has been made in epitaxial crystal growth techniques which have made possible the fabrication of novel semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "these modern microstructuring techniques can be used to laterally confine quasi - two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in e.g.,gaas / algaas heterostructure on a submicrometer scale to quasi - one dimensional structures ( quantum wires ) or quasi - zero - dimensional quantum dots .",
    "the system that we are considering in the present work can be realized by various methods , e.g. , the application of a laterally microstructured gate electrode and the holographic illumination technique which allow for a tunable periodic density modulation of the quasi - one - dimensional electron gas .",
    "there have been a number of approaches to study collective excitations spectrum of a quasi - two and one dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) systems theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "we extend the theoretical work by calculating the inter- and intra landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum of a density modulated quasi - one dimensional electron gas ( dm1deg ) in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field using the self - consistent - field ( scf ) approach and focus on the oscillatory behavior of the intra - landau band magnetoplasmons . in this context",
    ", the term 1d  means that we start with the original 2deg in @xmath1 plane .",
    "we apply a confining potential in the @xmath2-direction leaving the @xmath3-direction free .",
    "a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath4-direction perpendicular to the @xmath1 plane of the original 2deg . the collective particle energy spectrum , @xmath5 consists of energetically separated 1d subbands formed due to lateral confining potential along the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the electron wave vector @xmath6 characterizes the free motion in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the effect of density modulation is to broaden the landau levels into minibands whose width oscillates as a function of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the electronic states are thus substantially altered , resulting in modulated density of states , as shown by magnetocapacitance measurements @xcite of the quasi - two - dimensional systems .",
    "behavior akin to this is expected for the quasi - one dimensional system under consideration .",
    "the density of states affects many response and transport phenomena as well as thermodynamic properties . of these ,",
    "one of the most important properties is the collective excitation spectrum and we evaluate the dynamic , nonlocal dielectric response function to study it .",
    "as we show in our work for a quasi - one - dimensional system , magnetoplasma spectrum significantly exhibits modulation of the electronic density - of - states as oscillating magnetoplasma frequencies .",
    "as we discuss in detail , this result is obtained in the regime of weak modulation and long wavelength thus we do nt find this result discussed in @xcite .",
    "another condition for the observation of these oscillations is that the coupling between intra - landau band mode and inter - landau band mode must be small .",
    "mixing of these modes can be minimized by controlling the degree of density modulation and by applying an appropriate magnetic field and confinement potential .",
    "our system is a density modulated quasi - one dimensional electron gas ( dm1deg ) built on a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by inducing another effective confining potential @xmath7 ) along the @xmath2-direction which is assumed to be parabolic .",
    "the magnetic field is perpendicular to the @xmath1 plane in which electrons with unmodulated areal density @xmath8 , effective mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 are confined .",
    "we employ the landau gauge and write the vector potential as @xmath11 .",
    "the two - dimensional schrodinger equation with parabolic confining potential in the landau gauge is ( @xmath12 here ) ; @xmath13+\\frac{1}{2}(m^{\\ast}\\omega_{0}% ^{2}x^{2}),\\label{1}%\\ ] ] since the hamiltonian does not depend on the @xmath3 coordinate , the unperturbed wavefunctions are plane waves in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "this allows us to write for the wavefunctions , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being a normalization length in @xmath3-direction and @xmath16 a 2d position vector on the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "substitution of the above form of the wavefunction in to equation ( 1 ) , yields @xmath17 with ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath20 is the coordinate of cyclotron orbit center and @xmath21 is the magnetic length , @xmath22 is the normalized effective mass . in the @xmath2-direction",
    ", the hamiltonian has the form of a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "hence we can write the unmodulated eigenstates in the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a normalized harmonic oscillator wavefunction centered at @xmath26 and @xmath27 are hermite polynomials [ 15 ] with @xmath28 the landau level quantum number .",

    "we employ first order ( in @xmath34 ) perturbation theory in the evaluation of the energy eigenvalues using the unperturbed wavefunctions .",

    "furthermore , the landau bandwidth ( @xmath42 ) oscillate as a function of @xmath28 , since @xmath43 is an oscillatory function of its index @xcite .",
    "the dynamic and static response properties of an electron system are all embodied in the structure of the density - density correlation function .",
    "we employ the ehrenreich - cohen self - consistent field ( scf ) approach @xcite to calculate the density - density correlation function .",
    "the scf treatment presented here is by its nature a high density approximation which has been successful in the study of collective excitations in lower - dimensional systems such as planar semiconductor superlattices @xcite and quantum wire structures @xcite , both with and without an applied magnetic field .",
    "such success has been convincingly attested by the excellent agreement of scf predictions of plasmon spectra with experiments .    following the scf approach ,",
    "the density response of electrons due to a perturbing potential is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the self - consistent potential and @xmath46 stands for the quantum numbers @xmath28 and @xmath6 .",

    "we can perform the @xmath49-sum in the above equation to obtain @xmath50 writing the induced particle density as @xmath51 allows us to rewrite equation ( 8) as @xmath52 : where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the density - density correlation function of the non - interacting electron system , given by @xmath55 where @xmath56^{2}%\\ ] ] with @xmath57= max(@xmath28 , @xmath58 ) , @xmath59= min(@xmath28 , @xmath58 ) , and @xmath60 an associated laguerre polynomial .",

    "the above equation can be solved to yield @xmath65 recalling that the self - consistent potential , @xmath66 is the sum of the external and induced potentials , multiplying both sides by @xmath67 and solving for @xmath68 yields @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the density - density correlation function of the interacting system with @xmath71 @xmath72 the 2-d coulomb potential . making use of the transformation @xmath73 with the fact that @xmath74 is an even function of @xmath75 and at the same time interchanging @xmath76 we write for the non - interacting density - density correlation function equation ( 8) @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\lbrack\\varepsilon(n , x_{0}+x_{0}^{\\prime})-\\varepsilon(n^{\\prime } , x_{0})+\\omega+i\\eta]^{-1}.\\label{14}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in writing the above equation we converted the @xmath6-sum into an integral over @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath78 is the fermi -dirac distribution function , @xmath79 and @xmath80    the above equations ( 13,14 ) will be the starting point of our examination of the inter - and intra - landau band plasmons .",
    "the form of the expressions for the real and imaginary part of the density - density correlation function makes the even and odd ( in frequency @xmath81 ) properties of these functions very apparent .",
    "these functions are the essential ingredients for theoretical considerations of such diverse problems as high frequency and steady state transport , static and dynamic screening and correlation phenomena .",
    "the plasma modes are readily furnished by the singularities of the function @xmath82 from the roots of the longitudinal plasmon dispersion relation obtained from equation ( 13 ) as @xmath83 along with the condition @xmath84 to ensure long - lived excitations .",
    "the roots of equation ( 15 ) give the plasma modes of the system .",
    "@xmath85 with @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the principal value .",
    "the plasma modes originate from two kinds of electronic transitions , those involving different landau bands ( inter - landau band plasmons ) and those within a single landau - band ( intra - landau band plasmons ) .",
    "inter - landau band plasmons involve the local 1d magnetoplasma mode and the bernstein - like plasma resonances @xcite , all of which involve excitation frequencies greater than the landau - band separation ( @xmath88 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "intra - landau band plasmons resonate at frequencies comparable to the bandwidths , and the existence of this new class of modes is due to finite width of the landau levels .",
    "these magnetoplasmons in quasi - one - dimensional system have been analysed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the oscillatory behavior of these magnetoplasmons .",
    "the occurrence of such intra - landau band plasmons is accompanied by sdh type of oscillatory behavior @xcite in @xmath0 .",
    "these oscillations @xcite are not with constant period in @xmath0 ( which exhibits significant effect for small value of @xmath89 and corresponding large value of @xmath0 ) due to confinement potential acting in the @xmath2-direction and also show the depopulation , and cross over effects @xcite on magnetoplasmons from density modulated two - dimensional electron gas ( dm2deg ) @xcite to density modulated one - dimensional electron gas ( dm1deg ) .",
    "sdh type of oscillations result from the emptying out of electrons from successive landau bands when they pass through the fermi level as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "the amplitude of the sdh type of oscillations is a monotonic function of magnetic field , when the landau bandwidth is independent of the band index @xmath28 . in dm1deg",
    "considered here , the landau bandwidths oscillate as a function of the band index @xmath90 it is to be expected that such oscillating bandwidths would effect the plasmon spectrum of the intra - landau band type , resulting in another type of oscillation .",
    "these oscillations are not with constant period in @xmath91 because at small value of @xmath89 and corresponding large value of @xmath0 cyclotron diameter exceeds the characteristic length of the confining potential .    for the excitation spectrum , we need to numerically solve equation ( 15 ) for all vectors , frequencies , magnetic field , and confinement potential .",
    "we will consider the case of weak modulation ( @xmath92 ) and long wave length . in these limits we can solve equation ( 16 ) analytically for zero temperature .",
    "we expand the coefficient @xmath93 to lowest order in its argument with the result @xmath94 the term in parentheses is easily recognized as the unmodulated particle density @xmath95 where @xmath28 is sum over all occupied landau bands . defining the plasma frequency through @xmath96we",
    "finally obtain the inter - landau - band plasmon dispersion relation @xmath97 or @xmath98 which is the ordinary one - dimensional plasmon dispersion relation .",
    "the intra - landau - band plasmon dispersion relation for zero temperature reduces to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 with @xmath101 the heaviside unit step function .",
    "we have derived the expression for @xmath102 ( equation 18 ) under the condition @xmath103 as @xmath104 which leads to a relation between the frequency and the landau level broadening @xmath105\\mid$ ] .",
    "this ensures that @xmath106 and the intra - landau - band magnetoplasmons are undamped .",
    "for a given @xmath107 , this can be achieved with a small but nonzero @xmath108 ( recall that @xmath109 ) .    in general , the inter- and intra - landau - band modes",
    "are coupled for arbitrary magnetic field strengths .",
    "the general dispersion relation is : @xmath110 this equation yields two modes which are given by : @xmath111 which reduces to : @xmath112 and @xmath113 with corrections of order @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "so long as @xmath116 mixing of the inter - and intra - band modes is small . only the intra - landau - band mode ( @xmath117 will be excited in the frequency regime @xmath118 @xmath119 we now present the results for the oscillatory bahavior of the intra - landau band magnetoplasmons as a function of @xmath0 and the confinement energy .",
    "the intra - landau - band plasma frequency given by equation ( 18 ) is shown graphically in figure ( 1 ) as a function of @xmath0 for two different values of confinement energy , using parameters @xcite : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 m@xmath123 , @xmath124 nm , and @xmath32 = 1.0 mev ; also we take @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath127 being the fermi wave number of the unmodulated 1deg in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the modulation induced oscillations are apparent , superimposed on sdh - type oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are not with constant period in @xmath0 ( which exhibits significant effect for small value of @xmath89 and corresponding large value of @xmath0 ) due to confinement potential acting in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "they have longer period and much reduced amplitude .",
    "it must be noted that this result is obtained in the regime of weak modulation and long wavelength .",
    "another condition for the observation of these oscillations is that the coupling between inter - landau band mode and intra - landau band mode must be small .",
    "these modes involve different energy scales @xmath128 for the former and @xmath129 for the latter .",
    "mixing of these modes can be minimized by controlling the degree of density modulation and by applying an appropriate magnetic field and confinement potential .",
    "the origin of two types of oscillations can be understood by a closer analytic examination of equation ( 18 ) . in the regime , @xmath130 ,",
    "the unit step function vanishes for all but the highest occupied landau band , corresponding , say , to the band index @xmath131 .",
    "the sum over @xmath28 is trivial , and plasma frequency is given as @xmath132 .",
    "the analytic structure primarily responsible for the sdh type of oscillations is the function @xmath133 , which jumps periodically from zero ( when the fermi level is above the highest occupied landau band ) to unity ( when the fermi level is contained with in the highest occupied landau band ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the periodic modulation of the amplitude of the sdh type oscillations shown in figures ( 1 & 2 ) is due to the oscillatory nature of the factor @xmath134 , which has been shown in a two - dimensional system to exhibit commensurability oscillations @xcite . in our case , these oscillations are not with constant period in @xmath135 this clearly indicates the one dimensional character of our theory . in a dm2deg",
    "the number of occupied landau levels increases with decreasing @xmath89 , leading , ideally , to an infinite number of sdh type of oscillations periodic in @xmath0 @xcite . in a 1deg system however , only a finite number of 1d subbands are occupied at @xmath136 , giving rise to finite number of sdh type of oscillations and deviations from the @xmath0 period , because with increasing @xmath89 the 1d density of states increases and the hybrid 1d subband landau levels are depopulated @xcite . in the extreme 2d regime ( @xmath137 ) , the fermi energy goes to the bottom of the 1d landau subband .",
    "if we lower the confinement potential the magnetic confinement overcomes the potential confinement , hence we are in the original 2d regime @xcite . on the other hand",
    "if we increase the confinement potential , the confinement potential overcomes the magnetic confinement and we have a crossover @xcite from a two - dimensional system to a one - dimensional system . in figures ( 1 , 2 ) we have plotted the intra - landau band plasma frequency as a function of the inverse magnetic field  for two different confinement energies given by eq . ( 18 )",
    "we have determined the intra - landau band plasmon frequency for a density modulated quasi - one dimensional electron gas in the presence of a magnetic field employing the scf approach .",
    "furthermore , we have seen the oscillations of the intra - landau band plasma frequency in 1d regime as a function of @xmath138 , their origin lies in the interplay of the three physical length scales of the system i.e. the modulation period , confinement length and cyclotron diameter at the fermi level .",
    "when a strong magnetic field is applied , our model recovers complete landau quantization and for a very high magnetic field our results are comparable with extreme 2d regime ( @xmath139 ) ."
