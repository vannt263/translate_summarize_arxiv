    "one of the early stages of massive star formation is the `` hot core '' phase ( kurtz et al .",
    "2000 , @xcite ) , which is characterized by masses of @xmath21  of molecular gas at temperatures of @xmath22  k , leading to a rich line spectrum at submillimeter wavelengths like that of the prototypical orion hot core .",
    "the chemical composition of hot cores is quite distinct for its high abundances of fully hydrogenated , large carbon - bearing molecules ( @xcite ) , as opposed to dark clouds which show predominantly unsaturated species and molecular ions ( @xcite ) .",
    "saturated carbon chains are not expected in large quantities by steady - state gas - phase models , which led @xcite and @xcite to propose models where these molecules are made on dust grains , and evaporate into the gas phase when the newly - formed star heats up its surroundings .",
    "this leads to a short period ( @xmath23  yr ) when the envelope of the young star is rich in complex organic molecules .",
    "grain surface reactions at low temperature lead to hydrogenation if atomic  h is able to quantum tunnel through activation barriers as proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model makes specific predictions for the abundance ratios of co , ,  and their deuterated versions which for a reasonable choice of parameters fit the abundances observed in the compact ridge in orion as shown by @xcite .",
    "however , it is unknown if other sources can be fit as well . alternatively ,",
    "processing by ultraviolet light or energetic particles may change the ice composition in the vicinity of young stars .",
    "one key molecule to test models of hot core chemistry is methanol , . at temperatures",
    "@xmath24  k , production of  in the gas phase goes mainly via radiative association of ch@xmath25 and , an inefficient process yielding abundances of only @xmath26 relative to  ( lee et al .",
    "observations of  toward dark and translucent clouds by @xcite and @xcite yield abundances of @xmath7 , which suggests that grain chemistry operates . toward the orion hot core and compact ridge ,  abundances of @xmath8 have been observed by @xcite and @xcite , and even higher abundances , @xmath27 , have been inferred from observations of  masers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "methanol has also been observed in the solid state at infrared wavelengths from the ground by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite and recently by @xcite , at abundances up to @xmath28 .    to study the organic chemistry in warm ( @xmath29  k ) and dense ( @xmath30  ) circumstellar envelopes , this paper discusses observations of  and  lines at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "although gas - grain interactions are clearly important for methanol , it is unknown how efficiently ( if at all ) surface reactions modify the composition of the ices . in addition , it is still open what process returns the molecules to the gas phase : thermal heating , shocks or both ?",
    "finally , the ice layer must have formed at temperatures and densities much lower than the present situation , and hence provides a unique fossil record of the conditions in the molecular cloud prior to star formation .",
    "the sources are thirteen massive ( @xmath31  ) stars , which are at an early stage of evolution and still embedded in @xmath32  of dust and molecular gas .",
    "a few of the sources are hot cores by the definition of @xcite , but most are in an even younger phase where most of the envelope is still at low temperatures .",
    "the physical structure of the soures has been studied by @xcite , who developed detailed temperature and density profiles .",
    "the wealth of  and  lines , combined with the physical models , allows the determination of abundance profiles for  and , which demonstrate that  evaporates off dust particles in the envelope on a @xmath33  yr time scale , while  is predominantly formed in the gas phase .",
    "the excitation and abundance of  are therefore useful evolutionary indicators during the embedded stage of star formation . moreover , by comparing the observed amounts of evaporated  and  to a model of grain surface chemistry , we set limits on the density and the duration of the pre - protostellar phase .",

    "the evaporation temperature of  and  ice , @xmath96  k , is much higher than that of co and o , @xmath231  k , and that of h , @xmath232  k , depending on its surface mobility and reactivity .",
