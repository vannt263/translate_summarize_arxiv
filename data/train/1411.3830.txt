    "polarization observations in the optical , infrared and submillimeter bands often routinely detect extended polarized emission , revealing magnetic field morphologies across entire star - forming regions . while the higher - frequency optical / near - infrared light is polarized as a result of scattering off dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the submillimeter wavelengths directly show the emitted polarized light from dust .",
    "the grains are thought to be aligned with their shorter axes parallel to the magnetic field lines in most situations , thus emitting in a plane perpendicular to the field lines @xcite .",
    "many submillimeter facilities have developed their polarization capabilities .",
    "operating at a wavelengths @xmath10 m , hertz on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) mapped magnetic fields in star - formation regions with a resolution of about 20 .",
    "a summary catalog with 56 sources is given in @xcite .",
    "its successor instrument , sharp @xcite , is currently being operated on the cso , achieving a resolution of about 10 .",
    "dust continuum polarization was also observed with scupol on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at @xmath11 m with a binned resolution of about 9 , summarized in the legacy catalog with 83 sources by @xcite .",
    "higher - resolution maps are possible with interferometers .",
    "the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) array reached about 2 -4at 1.3 and 3.3  mm @xcite .",
    "more recently , both the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) and the submillimeter array ( sma ) presented results from legacy - type surveys toward 38 star - forming regions and cores ( @xcite , @xmath12 , @xmath13 mm ) and 14 high - mass star - forming clumps ( @xcite , @xmath14 , @xmath15 m ) .",
    "all these observations have in common that they often cover large enough areas ( of polarized emission ) such that connected patches of projected magnetic field orientations become visible .",
    "this is advantageous to investigate magnetic field morphologies .",
    "consequently , several studies are making use of this in combination with other tracers such as outflows , larger scale magnetic field orientations or theoretical models . the class 0 low - mass protostar l1157-mm is found to have an hourglass morphology ( from carma observations ) that aligns both with its outflow and also with the larger scale field detected by sharp @xcite . the magnetic field in the dense clump iras 20126 - 4104 ( sharp , @xcite ) is both aligned with its bipolar outflow as well as the larger scale field from optical polarimetry data .",
    "a comparison with numerical simulations indicates a cloud rotation axis inclined by about @xmath16 with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "a positive correlation between mean field orientations and both pseudo - disk symmetry axes and bipolar outflow axes is derived from seven class 0 protostars in @xcite and @xcite based on sharp polarization detections , sampling @xmath17  au scales . on smaller scales , @xcite find that a subset of their sources has consistent magnetic field orientations between the larger scale ( @xmath18 , probed by single - dish submillieter telescopes ) and the smaller scale ( @xmath19 ) magnetic fields from carma .",
    "this is interpreted as the magnetic field playing a role in regulating infall down to smaller scales ( @xmath20  au ) in these sources .",
    "bipolar outflows ( co 2 - 1 transition ) in their sample of low - mass protostars seem to be randomly oriented with respect to the smaller scale fields @xcite , although there is a trend that low - polarization sources have their outflows perpendicular to small - scale fields , indicating that these fields might being wrapped by rotation @xcite .",
    "the sma sample @xcite indicates that magnetic fields at dense core scales are either aligned within @xmath21 of or perpendicular to the larger parsec - scale fields .",
    "similar to the carma result , they also conclude that outflows ( co 3 - 2 transition ) are randomly oriented with the core magnetic fields .",
    "numerical simulations of collapsing cores , investigating scenarios to align / misalign rotation , outflows and magnetic fields are presented in e.g. , @xcite .    in ideal situations , magnetic field theoretical models and simulations",
    "can be fairly closely matched to polarization observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a mathematical model to fit an observed hourglass field morphology is derived in @xcite .",
    "their analytic formulae  assuming an axisymmetric purely poloidal field threading a flattened star - forming core and connecting to a uniform background field  are using the shape of the hourglass pattern to constrain the ratio of local - to - background magnetic field strength .",
    "provided an independent measurement of the background field strength , local field strength values in a region of interest can be calculated from their analytic approach .    many observed star - forming sources are , however , irregular and complicated .",
    "it is , thus , important and desirable to develop new techniques that can directly and independently extract information from detected polarization .",
    "a major shortcoming of dust polarization is that only sky - projected field morphologies ( rotated by 90@xmath22 from measured polarization orientations ) are observed but no magnetic field strengths .",
    "recent developments aiming at improving this situation include the polarization - angle dispersion function leading to an estimate of the turbulent - to - mean magnetic field strength @xcite , the study of turbulent velocity dispersion spectra of co - existing ions and molecules to constrain the ambipolar diffusion scale and the plane - of - sky component field strength @xcite and the polarization - intensity gradient method to derive the local total magnetic field strength @xcite . in this work here ,",
    "we focus on a previously introduced observable : the angle @xmath0 between the local magnetic field orientation and its underlying dust emission gradient orientation .",
    "although not limited to dust polarization measurements , we focus on dust submillimeter observations across a large and diverse sample , with the goal to ( 1 ) illustrate characteristic features and differences in @xmath0 based on a to date largest sample of 50 sources , and ( 2 ) to provide an interpretation for @xmath0 via the polarization - intensity gradient method , illustrating clear trends in the importance of the magnetic field across the sample that are accessible via @xmath0 .",
    "this study is part of the program on the sma @xcite to investigate the structure of the magnetic field from large to small scales .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section_sample ] briefly describes selection criteria and properties of the sma and the cso sample .",
    "the main observable  the angle @xmath0  its interpretation and the polarization - intensity gradient method are summarized in section [ section_analysis ] , based on earlier results in @xcite .",
    "results for the angle @xmath0 follow in section [ section_result ] , starting from overall - sample to group and source - averaged results .",
    "section [ discussion ] discusses interpretation and comparison with previous results .",
    "conclusion and summary are given in section [ section_conclusion ] .",
    "this work combines data from two different samples and telescopes ( table [ table_quantities ] ) .",
    "hertz on the single - dish telescope cso has published a catalog of polarization observations at a wavelength @xmath23 m with a resolution @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the sma , operating in various array configurations at @xmath25 m , is sampling smaller scales with resolutions of a few arcseconds down to sub - arcsecond scales .",
    "the sma has been pioneering high - resolution submillimeter polarization observations . whereas the earliest observations were focusing on the most promising and brightest targets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , later receiver and correlator upgrades made it possible to also observe fainter sources .",
    "this has boosted the sample of high - resolution low - and high - mass star - forming regions which currently totals about 30 sources .",
    "a substantial number of these sources ( 14 ) was observed through a recent dedicated sma polarization legacy program @xcite , sampling star - forming clumps with densities larger than @xmath26  @xmath27 at scales around or smaller than 0.1  pc .",
    "detailed follow - up source - by - source analyses are being conducted , with first results published for dr21(oh ) @xcite , g192.16 - 3.84 @xcite , g35.2 - 0.74 n @xcite . for our analysis here , we have applied selection criteria identical to the ones for the cso sample : coherent polarization patches with at least 10 polarization segments , and a stokes @xmath28 continuum detection strong enough to define a gradient .",
    "besides newly detected sources from the sma polarization legacy program , the sample analyzed here also comprises some earlier observed targets ( table [ table_quantities ] ) .",
    "the cso / hertz polarization catalog contains 56 regions , mostly galactic sources and some galaxies @xcite .",
    "we chose a total of 27 sources from the cso catalog .",
    "sources are selected based on their coverage of detected polarized emission , together with the condition that the stokes @xmath28 continuum emission need to be strong enough to define a gradient . in order to have at least some connected patches",
    ", we request a minimum of 10 measured polarization ",
    "intensity gradient pairs for our analysis . @xmath2-maps",
    "together with some basic statistical numbers for each of the cso - selected sources are given in @xcite .",
    "the local angle @xmath0 is measured between a magnetic field orientation and a dust emission gradient ( figure [ schematic_simple ] ) . in our study here ,",
    "an observed dust polariztion orientation which is then rotated by 90@xmath22 reveals the magnetic field orientation .",
    "nevertheless , any measurement showing the magnetic field morphology , as e.g. , line polarization , faraday rotation or zeeman splitting , can be used and what follows is generally applicable .",
    "@xmath0 is uanambiguously defined in the range 0 to @xmath29 ( as the smaller of the two angles complementary to @xmath30 ) , or @xmath31 to @xmath29 when giving it a sense of orientation .",
    "@xmath0 is straighforward to derive from an observation .",
    "a simple inspection by eye can often distinguish between zones of small ( prevailing field orientation rather orthogonal to emission contours ) and zones of large @xmath0 ( prevailing field orientation rather parallel to contours ) .",
    "_ what is the meaning of the angle @xmath0 ?",
    "_ with the help of an ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) force equation , by decomposing the magnetic field orientation in an orthonormal system with unity vectors parallel and normal to an emission contour ( figure [ schematic_simple ] ) , the angle @xmath2 with @xmath32 $ ] quantifies the fraction of the available magnetic field tension force along a density gradient direction @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath2 can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment deviation or efficiency that measures how the magnetic field is responsible for an observed density morphology along the gradient direction .",
    "magnetic field lines closely aligned with density gradients , as e.g. , seen in polar regions in collapsing systems , yield @xmath33 or small , which indicates that the magnetic field tension force is not or only minimally slowing down infall in this region along the density gradient direction .",
    "contrary to that , in regions where the magnetic field is more bent , as e.g. , in the inner part of an accretion plane where the field becomes close to orthogonal to a density gradient , @xmath2 is significantly larger than 0 . hence , the field tension force can maximally inhibit collapse or any motion along the density gradient direction . therefore , @xmath2-maps contain information on the role of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "changes in @xmath2 across a star - formation region can reveal zones of major or minor magnetic field influence .",
    "additionally , many sources reveal bimodal distributions in @xmath0 when giving it a sense of orientation , i.e. , when differentiating between a field line rotated clockwise or counter - clockwise with respect to an emission gradient .",
    "this can be interpreted as signs of a collapse ( or the beginning of a collapse ) which will start to bend initially straight magnetic field lines along the accretion direction that subsequently leads to @xmath34 above and below the accretion plane @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath0 and its characteristic features , found across a sample of about 30 sources in @xcite , are based entirely on observations only . in order to further quantitatively assess the magnetic field , some of the observational results in the following sections will be further analyzed with the polarization - intensity gradient method @xcite . at every position of detected polarization",
    ", this method leads to a local magnetic field strength and a ratio between the local field tension force and gravity .",
    "the background of this method is the ideal mhd force equation , making use of the misalignment angle @xmath2 . in a molecular cloud",
    ", the interaction of all the forces ( magnetic field , gravity , pressure gradients ) leads to the observed magnetic field and dust morphologies .",
    "hence , these forces leave a geometrical imprint , like the misalignment angle @xmath2 , that can be identified with the various terms in the mhd force equation . in particular ,",
    "the direction of the field tension force is orthogonal to the detected field orientation ( i.e. , parallel to the detected dust polarization orientation ) , a field curvature can be derived from adjacent field segments , the direction of the local gravitational pull can be calculated by summing up all the surrounding mass . with this , a force triangle can be constructed at every location of detected polarization . this triangle can be closed and solved for the local field strength under the approximation that the orientation of the emission gradient is a measure for the inertial term in the mhd force equation . by taking additionally into account velocity bulk directions ,",
    "this approximation was further studied in @xcite and confirmed to be robust for field strength and force ratio estimates .",
    "the resulting local field strength is given by @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the gravitational pull and pressure gradient , and @xmath38 is the difference in orientation between the local gravitational pull and/or pressure gradient and the emission gradient ( figure [ schematic_simple ] ) .",
    "@xmath39 is the density and @xmath40 is the magnetic field radius .",
    "it is important to remark that this method provides a total magnetic field strength . with the field tension force @xmath41",
    ", the above equation can be rewritten as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are gravitational pull and any possible additional pressure gradient .",
    "@xmath5 quantifies how significant the local field tension force is , as compared to the other forces .",
    "interestingly , this ratio is free of any molecular cloud model assumptions and only relies on two measurable angles that reflect the geometrical imprint of magnetic field and other forces . assuming pressure gradients to be typically small where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the molecular cloud mass , radius and temperature .",
    "@xmath48 is related to the cloud gas composition and proportional to the hydrogen mass , @xmath49 , with a numerical factor of order unity . for pure thermal support",
    ", this leads to @xmath50pc .",
    "the sources in our samples comprise hundreds up to thousands of solar masses .",
    "this leads to thermally supported length scales of @xmath5110  pc or larger .",
    "our largest observed scales in the cso sample are about 1  pc , with most of the sources being observed on scales of @xmath52  mpc .",
    "thus , we are very likely sampling sufficiently small scales where thermal pressure is small and negligible compared to gravity .",
    "this also still holds if the molecular cloud temperature is higher with @xmath5320 - 30  k. yet an additional pressure gradient can result from large - scale flows .",
    "compressive flows are suggested to contribute to and shape observed filamentary networks with coherent structures on pc- or larger scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "significant pressure gradients might be present here , in particular for supersonic flows and turbulence .",
    "omitting such gradients can lead to uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "this shortcoming can be overcome if additional large - scale velocity information is available overlapping with polarization data .",
    "the sample analyzed here , however , is again probing mostly smaller scales which likely eliminates a possibly significant bias from large - scale converging flows . finally , pressure from turbulence with velocity @xmath54 scales as @xmath55 .",
    "with typical velocity dispersions of @xmath56  km / s in our sample , gravity is also dominating over turbulent pressure on scales of @xmath57  pc and smaller . ] compared to gravity in our samples , @xmath5 provides a criterion whether local collapse is possible ( @xmath58 ) or whether the field tension is large enough to inhibit local collapse ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "@xmath5-maps of molecular clouds systematically show zones of smaller- or larger - than - one @xmath5-values .",
    "the same transition can often also be observed in @xmath2-maps which makes them an easy tracer for changes in the field significance . @xmath2- and @xmath5-maps for each of the cso - selected sources ( section [ section_cso_sample ] and table [ table_quantities ] )",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "finally , both @xmath5 and @xmath60 are little or not at all affected by projection effects .",
    "this is possible because the projection correction enters as a ratio of two inclination angles ( for @xmath38 and @xmath2 ) . for identical inclination angles for magnetic field line and emission gradient",
    ", the projection effect cancels out .",
    "the projection effect is negligible or less than 30% as long as one inclination angle is within 45@xmath22 and the other one is not more than 50@xmath22 different from the first one @xcite .",
    "this section starts by presenting sma - cso - combined overall results ( section [ result_sample ] ) .",
    "this is followed by a refined analysis where sources from the combined samples are categorized based on proposed criteria ( section [ result_category ] ) .",
    "finally , section [ result_individual ] looks into averaged source - by - source trends and compares them to the proposed categorization from section [ result_category ] .",
    "results for both all independent @xmath0 , @xmath38 and @xmath5 , and also for their source - averaged quantities @xmath61 are shown .",
    "we start by looking for general overall trends , based on the combined full sma - cso sample . here",
    ", we intentionally do not distinguish between sma and cso sources or any further source properties because we are aiming at characterizing the magnetic field in any star - forming region . to this purpose",
    ", we show for all sources with all their detected polarization orientations , their angles @xmath2 with their corresponding @xmath5-values ( figure [ figure_sample_scatter ] ) . for the total of 50 sources ,",
    "this amounts to close to 4,000 independent ( @xmath62)-pairs .",
    "this scatter plot clearly traces and follows an upper envelope which is determined by the maximum possible @xmath5-values which are @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "the combined sample fills the entire possible range in @xmath2 with a distribution displaying a broad peak around smaller @xmath2-values with a slow roll - off and an extended tail towards larger values ( lower panel in figure [ source_psi_delta ] ) . binning @xmath2 into intervals of 10@xmath22",
    "shows uniform @xmath2-distributions with gradually fewer data points in subsequent bins towards larger @xmath2-values .",
    "the distributions of @xmath5 show broad peaks around @xmath5-values initially smaller than 1 .",
    "these peaks broaden in subsequent @xmath2 bins and shift eventually toward @xmath5-values larger than 1 . at this point here",
    ", no distinction is made between individual sources . as we will discuss in the sections [ result_category ] and [ result_individual ] , distinct source types",
    "preferentially fall into distinct zones in the scatter plot in figure [ figure_sample_scatter ] . filling the entire possible ranges in @xmath2 and @xmath5",
    "possibly indicates that we might have a fairly complete and unbiased sample representing all possible source types .",
    "we stress that it is not automatically obvious from the beginning that the scatter plot ( figure [ figure_sample_scatter ] ) needs to show a complete ( though not uniform ) coverage .",
    "this is not obvious because the force ratio @xmath65 allows for a vast range of @xmath5-values within @xmath66 . in particular , values could be exclusively always smaller than 1 , or they could be always @xmath67 .",
    "nevertheless , values cover a range across the dividing line @xmath68 . while a single angle @xmath2 can be affected by projection effects due to its unknown inclination angle , for a large number of more than 1,000 independent data points projection effects",
    "are likely averaging out .",
    "the binned uniform @xmath2-distributions together with the gradually broadening @xmath5-distributions suggest that , generally on average , larger @xmath2-values point toward larger @xmath5-values . and",
    "indeed , @xmath2-values averaged for all the binned intervals confirm this .",
    "furthermore , the binned values follow approximately the curve @xmath69 ( figure [ figure_sample_scatter ] ) , which is simply the mean between 0 and @xmath70 .    in conclusion , for a large sample without further distinguishing any individual sources , we find a sample - wide trend where growing @xmath2-values indicate growing @xmath5-values following @xmath71 . on average ,",
    "gravity is balanced by the magnetic field tension force , i.e. , @xmath72 , for @xmath73 .",
    "individual sources or groups of sources can still reveal different properties ( section [ result_category ] and [ result_individual ] ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario with an evolutionary magnetic field role which leaves its imprints in the angle @xmath2 .",
    "two distinct intermediate phases are identified ( table [ table_source_type ] ) : sources of type iia ( with their magnetic field roughly perpendicular to the cloud major axis ) , and sources of type iib ( with their magnetic field roughly parallel to the cloud major axis ) .",
    "this categorization was motivated by the very clear examples of mon r2 ( iia ) and m@xmath74 ( iib ) from the cso catalog @xcite .",
    "additional sources from the cso sample were then tentatively categorized in table 2 in @xcite . for completeness , an extended version of this table including the new sma sources is reproduced here ( table [ table_quantities ] ) .",
    "since we are also interested in inter - sample differences ( between the sma and the cso ) we show results here separately for the two instruments .",
    "the top row in figure [ hist_cat ] shows @xmath2-histograms for all the sources that are ( clearly ) identified as iia and iib .",
    "this includes 12 iia and 7 iib sources from the cso sample and 9 iia and 4 iib sources from the sma sample .",
    "the remaining sources are discarded because of their less complete and/or less clear polarization patterns still lists an attempted tentative categorization for all the sources in both samples . ] .",
    "individual source - based histograms in appendix b in @xcite for the cso sample were already hinting differences in distributions ( which was an additional motivation for the classification scheme ) .",
    "the group - based histograms now reveal a very clear difference with a falling distribution with @xmath75 ( sma ) and 30@xmath22 ( cso ) , and an opposite trend with a growing distribution with @xmath76 ( sma ) and 51@xmath22 ( cso ) . as an obvious consequence , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test rejects the null hypothesis ( i.e. , probability @xmath77 that the two samples iia and iib originate from an identical distribution ) with @xmath78 ( sma ) and @xmath79 ( cso ) , where the maximum deviations ( @xmath80-value ) between their cumulative distributions are @xmath81 ( sma ) and @xmath82 ( cso ) .",
    "an inter - sample ks test , i.e. , iia@xmath83 versus iia@xmath84 and iib@xmath83 versus iib@xmath84 , gives @xmath85 and @xmath86 for iia and @xmath87 and @xmath88 for iib .",
    "we can , thus , conclude that equal - type distributions from two different instruments show a much closer resemblance than distributions from different types from the same instrument , with iib - type sources even showing a high probability to reflect identical distributions .",
    "this is intriguing because this indicates that the sampling of different scales and densities by the sma and the cso is less relevant in the context here .",
    "independent of that , both instruments seem to reveal the same different types of morphologies .",
    "this can also be seen from the cumulative distributions in column 5 in figure [ hist_cat ] .",
    "the last column shows the results for 5 type - iii sources from the sma sample .",
    "no type - iii sources are found in the cso sample .",
    "the @xmath2- distribution shows an even more pronounced peak towards small values with @xmath89 .    besides the angle @xmath2 , the stokes @xmath28 integrated dust emission is another prime observable that reflects mass and morphology in the star - forming regions . since every source has a different absolute flux emission , a peak - normalized emission , @xmath90 $ ] ,",
    "is used in order to compare emission distributions across samples .",
    "the third row in figure [ hist_cat ] displays histograms of @xmath91 for iia and iib in the sma and cso samples .",
    "for these distributions , the normalized stokes @xmath28 emission only at the positions of detected polarized emission ( where @xmath2 is identified ) is used .",
    "as it is evident from the two cso panels , the @xmath91-histograms for iia and iib are very different among the cso sample : the iia - group shows an exponential - like fall off toward the stronger emission end , whereas type - iib sources reveal a broader distribution in @xmath91 with a more gentle decrease with brighter emission . a ks test again clearly discriminates between the two distributions ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "the mean normalized emissions are @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the observed stokes @xmath28 emission is an integrated and projected quantity .",
    "nevertheless , the clear difference in distributions between iia and iib is likely pointing to some underlying differences in morphology ; e.g. , iib cso sources show more abundant brighter areas than iia sources , which could be a consequence of flatter or steeper density profiles .",
    "all sma types ( iia , iib , iii ) show exponential - like fall offs where all average values are around 0.30 .",
    "all the sma distributions are fairly similar to the cso - iia distribution , leaving only the cso - iib distribution as clearly distinct ( blue dashed line in the cumulative distribution plot in the third row .    with the clear segregation in @xmath2",
    ", the magnetic field seems a plausible candidate to explain these .",
    "therefore , we proceed to analyze and interpret the above observational findings with the polarization intensity gradient method @xcite .",
    "histograms for the field significance @xmath5 are shown in the fourth row in figure [ hist_cat ] .",
    "@xmath5-maps were previously published in appendix b in @xcite for the cso sources . for the histograms in figure [ hist_cat ] , a sample - based ( iia , iib ) @xmath96-clip",
    "is applied to the @xmath5-values in order to remove outliers - value of the order of @xmath97 can significantly boost @xmath3 because typical @xmath5-values are of the order @xmath98 .",
    "we note that outliers are always a consequence of the exponentially growing @xmath99 for small angles @xmath100 . ] .",
    "similarly , values below @xmath101 ( i.e. , 1% field significance ) are removed .",
    "both groups of iia sources show more uniform distributions up to about @xmath102 , followed by a rather sharp drop .",
    "type - iib groups reveal a more exponential - like tail with a significant contribution from the range @xmath103 .",
    "a ks test identifies the two types of distributions as clearly different ( cso iia versus iib : @xmath104 , @xmath105 ; sma iia versus iib : @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) .",
    "average values differ with @xmath108 ( sma ) and @xmath109 ( sma ) and @xmath110 ( cso ) and @xmath111 ( cso ) .",
    "the sma iii sources show an even more pronounced peak at smaller @xmath5-values with @xmath112 .",
    "the systematic difference between iia , iib and iii is also clearly seen in the cumulative distributions with an almost complete absence of values @xmath59 for iii .",
    "thus , the observed differences in @xmath2 between the samples iia and iib seem to point to a different role of the magnetic field , where @xmath5 provides a way to quantitatively discriminate between the samples , identifying iia ( @xmath113 ) and iib ( @xmath114 ) as potentially collapsing and non - collapsing systems on average .",
    "the bottom row in figure [ hist_cat ] illustrates this result with @xmath5-versus-@xmath2 plots : iia sources scatter more densely around smaller @xmath2-values , while iib sources scatter around larger @xmath2-values .",
    "type - iii sources are even more concentrated around smaller @xmath2-values ( table [ table_source_type ] ) .      from the category - based properties in section [ result_category ] , we now switch our focus to the analysis of individual sources . figure [ figure_schematic ] displays source - averaged @xmath3-values as a function of the source - averaged @xmath1-values .",

    "the majority of the iib sources shows @xmath114 , with @xmath117 in the range between @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "this finding is not entirely surprising after the clearly different distributions in figure [ hist_cat ] for iia and iib .",
    "nevertheless , it is not necessarily automatically clear that ensemble - based statistical properties of iia ( @xmath120 ) and iib ( @xmath121 ) also apply to each individual source in each category .",

    "the conservative estimate here is using @xmath199 .",
    "the second source property we are investigating is the mass - to - flux ratio . unlike earlier studies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) that are relying on a combination of magnetic field strength measurements ( like zeeman line splitting ) and a mass proxy to estimate this quantity",
    ", we are again making use of the field tension - to - gravity force ratio @xmath5 .",
    "explicitly writing out the forces and expressing them in terms of magnetic flux and mass enables us to link @xmath5 to the mass - to - flux ratio .",
    "the source - averaged mass - to - flux ratio , normalized to the critical mass - to - flux ratio , can be written as @xmath200 @xcite . the inverse square root results from the magnetic flux @xmath201 being proportional to the field strength @xmath60 whereas the tension force is proportional to @xmath202 .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath203 appears because magnetic flux is defined across a cylindrical cross - section @xmath204 .",
    "normalized mass - to - flux ratios and the gravity efficiency @xmath191 , the mass - to - flux ratio based on @xmath5 can also be locally computed . a clear transition from magnetically subcritical at larger",

    "are depicted in the bottom panel in figure [ efficiency_mass_flux ] versus @xmath1 .",
    "the overall result is a mass - to - flux ratio decreasing with larger misalignment angles @xmath1 , leaving most of the type - iia and -iii sources in a magnetically supercritical state while most of the type - iib sources fall below the critical mass - to - flux ratio into a subcritical state .",
    "this trend and transition are largely consistent with the scaling of the field significance @xmath5 in figure [ source_sigma_b_delta ] .",
    "a sample of 50 star - forming regions observed in submillimeter dust polarization with the sma and the cso is studied with the goal of assessing the significance of the magnetic field .",
    "our analysis is making use of the fundamental observable @xmath0 , which is the angle between magnetic field orientation and dust emission gradient .",
    "the key results are summarized in the following .    1",
    ".   across the entire sma - cso - combined sample , @xmath2 ( from about @xmath205 independent measurements ) is populating the entire range between 0 to @xmath206 with a broad peak around smaller values ; i.e. , the magnetic field is found to range from locally aligned ( @xmath207 ) to locally maximally misaligned ( @xmath206 ) with respect to the dust emission gradient . for this large sample , projection effects likely average out .",
    "when interpreting @xmath2 with the polarization intensity gradient method , growing @xmath2 generally indicates growing magnetic field significance @xmath5 ( the ratio of magnetic field tension force to gravity and/or pressure gradient ) . for local independent measurements , @xmath5 can be estimated on average with @xmath208 .",
    "categorization : _ various groups ( iia : tendency of magnetic field to be parallel to source minor axis ; iib : tendency of magnetic field to be parallel to source major axis ; iii : symmetrized source ) show striking differences in group - based @xmath2-histograms .",
    "type - iia and iib samples depict opposite trends , peaking at small and large @xmath2-values , respectively .",
    "type - iii sources ( only found in sma observations ) peak at even smaller @xmath2-values .",
    "sources that can not be categorized , can fall into or in between any of these groups .",
    "group - based differences in @xmath2 manifest themselves with clear differences in the group - based field significance : @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "source - averaged scaling across entire sample : _ a clear correlation is found between the source - averaged field misalignment @xmath1 and the source - averaged field significance @xmath3 . the combined sma - cso sample yields a best - fit log - linear scaling @xmath125 with a mean error @xmath211 .",
    "the angle @xmath38 between dust emission gradient and local gravity and/or pressure gradient , which is used in the exact derivation of @xmath65 , shows only small variations across the sample .",
    "this explains the tight correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 and makes @xmath1 a prime observable to trace and quantify the role of the magnetic field .",
    "these findings also hold separately for both the sma and the cso sources , possibly hinting a scale - free self - similar magnetic field influence .",
    "individual sources that are clearly categorized as iia ( and iii ) and iib almost exclusively show average @xmath212 ( collapse possible , on average ) and @xmath213 ( no collapse , on average ) . in either case ,",
    "local collapse can be possible or hindered as @xmath5-maps show distinct zones with @xmath5 larger or smaller than one .",
    "comparison with numerical study : _ numerical simulations of low- to high - magnetization molecular clouds find distributions in @xmath0 that can be matched with our observed iia- and iib - type segregation . in this framework ,",
    "iia- ( and iii-)type sources represent higher magnetization scenarios with stronger magnetic fields .",
    "large magnetic field strengths are , indeed , measured for , e.g. , w51 e2 , g31.41 + 0.31 and ngc 1333 iras 4a which are categorized as iia and iii . 5 .   _ bimodality : _ distributions of the average magnetic field misalignment @xmath1 for the sma and cso samples possibly are bimodal . however , combining them together broadens the distributions with a broad maximum peak around small @xmath1-values , a populated mid - range and a secondary smaller peak at larger @xmath1-values . assuming the sma and cso samples to be representative ,",
    "the most abundant magnetic field - source configuration has , on average , the magnetic field roughly aligned with the emission gradient .",
    "this is favoring magnetic fields that are roughly aligned with the source minor axis .",
    "75% of the sources show an average misalignment @xmath1 of less than @xmath182 .",

    ", an effectively acting gravitational force can be defined with a gravity efficiency factor @xmath214 .",
    "consequently , in the presence of a magnetic field , the standard free - fall collapse time grows and the star - formation efficiency is reduced .",
    "the sample - wide trend shows a drop in star - formation efficiency with larger @xmath1 with the average star - formation efficiency being significantly reduced or even suppressed for some sources with @xmath196 .",
    "@xmath5 can also be linked to the normalized mass - to - flux ratio .",
    "a transition from magnetically supercritical ( mostly for type - iia and -iii sources with small @xmath1 ) to subcritical ( for sources with larger @xmath1 ) is found across the sample .",

    "<S> submillimeter dust polarization measurements of a sample of 50 star - forming regions , observed with the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) covering pc - scale clouds to mpc - scale cores , are analyzed in order to quantify the magnetic field importance . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field misalignment @xmath0  the local angle between magnetic field and dust emission gradient  is found to be a prime observable , revealing distinct distributions for sources where the magnetic field is preferentially aligned with or perpendicular to the source minor axis . source - averaged misalignment angles @xmath1 fall into systematically different ranges , reflecting the different source - magnetic field configurations . </S>",

    "<S> when interpreting @xmath2 together with a magnetohydrodynamics force equation , as developed in the framework of the polarization - intensity gradient method , a sample - based log - linear scaling fits the magnetic field tension - to - gravity force ratio @xmath3 versus @xmath1 with @xmath4 ( mean error ) , providing a way to estimate the relative importance of the magnetic field , only based on measurable field misalignments @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the force ratio @xmath5 discriminates systems that are collapsible on average ( @xmath6 ) from other molecular clouds where the magnetic field still provides enough resistance against gravitational collapse ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample - wide trend shows a transition around @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> defining an effective gravitational force @xmath9 , the average magnetic - field - reduced star - formation efficiency is at least a factor of two smaller than the free - fall efficiency . for about one forth of the sources </S>",
    "<S> the average efficiency drops to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the force ratio @xmath5 can further be linked to the normalized mass - to - flux ratio , yielding an estimate for the latter one without the need of field strength measurements . across the sample , a transition from magnetically supercritical to subcritcal is observed with growing misalignment @xmath1 . </S>"
