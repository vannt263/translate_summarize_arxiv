    "the life times of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) have been at the center of a major debate for at least the last 40 years @xcite .",
    "gmcs that live for many free - fall times need a mechanism that prevents them from gravitational collapse . over the last couple of years",
    "the consensus is growing that the life times of gmcs are likely a few free - fall times , or even less @xcite and the focus has shifted towards the challenge of explaining the low star formation efficiencies in gmcs .",
    "the star formation efficiency per free fall time @xmath1 is defined as the ratio of free fall time @xmath2 to gas depletion time @xmath3 .",
    "in other words : @xmath4 i.e. the instantaneous star formation rate ( sfr ) is proportional to the available amount of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) via the proportionality factor @xmath5 .",
    "the observed value @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) means that only 1 - 2% of the mass of a gmc is converted into stars over a free - fall time .",
    "if star formation is supported by supersonic turbulence @xcite @xmath1 is expected to be only very weakly dependent on the mach number of the turbulent flow and thus approximatively constant , but this may be an oversimplification , see e.g. @xcite . on the other hand , if gmcs have life times of the order of a free fall time they do not need be supported by turbulence .",
    "the star formation efficiency in such clouds may increase as the mach number in the flow decreases and the cloud collapses , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we note that a time varying @xmath1 should introduce additional scatter in the relation between star formation rate and @xmath0 surface density on small ( @xmath7 pc ) scales .",
    "this scatter should propagate up to @xmath8kpc scales , see e.g. @xcite , and hence would contribute to the scatter in the kennicutt - schmidt relation .",
    "this , at least in principle , could be used to test observationally the time dependence of @xmath1 .    in section [",
    "sect : pitfalls ] we will discuss two common misconceptions that could give rise to the impression that @xmath1 varies over the life times of gmcs even if it is a constant .",
    "in section [ sect : model ] we present and analyze a toy model in order to exemplify and quantify our statements .",
    "in equation ( [ eq : dotmstar ] ) we define the _ star formation efficiency per free fall time _ @xmath1 .",
    "another commonly used efficiency is the _ star formation efficiency of the gmc _",
    "@xmath9 , i.e. the fraction of @xmath0 mass of the cloud that is converted into stars over the life time of the cloud . in a picture where gmcs start with an initial reservoir of @xmath0 , which is used in the subsequent star formation process",
    ", the final stellar mass @xmath10 is divided by the _ initial _",
    "@xmath0 mass of the cloud .",
    "if the cloud accretes a substantial amount of @xmath0 over its life time , the definition has to be generalized .",
    "we will use : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ maximal _ @xmath0 mass of the gmc . by definition @xmath9",
    "is a non evolving quantity and it can be estimated , e.g. , by comparing luminosity distribution of ob associations in the milky way with the mass spectrum of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it _ can not _ be directly measured on a cloud - to - cloud basis , because @xmath13 and @xmath14 must be known at two different times .",
    "instead such observations , see e.g. @xcite , estimate the following quantity @xmath15 the latter , approximate equality is due to the fact that for most observed gmcs @xmath13 is smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "obviously , @xmath16 increases over the life time of a cloud and should not be confused with either @xmath9 or @xmath1 . from ( [ eq : dotmstar ] ) we can estimate @xmath17 , hence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a constant fudge factor of order unity that depends on the actual time evolution of the sfrs and @xmath14 ( and @xmath1 if it is time dependent ) .",
    "we will estimate @xmath19 for a simple toy model in section [ sect : model ] . combining this result with equation ( [ eq : gmceps ] ) and ( [ eq : gmceta ] ) we obtain : @xmath20 \\left[\\frac{m_*(t)}{m_*({\\rm final})}\\right]\\left[\\frac{\\max(m_\\h2)}{m_\\h2(t)}\\right].\\ ] ]",
    "there are several ways of creating large values of @xmath21 and they correspond to the various terms in this equation .",
    "first , @xmath1 could be time dependent .",
    "for instance , it could smoothly increase as the cloud collapse advances or , alternatively , vary stochastically about some average value .",
    "a second possibility is that some clouds may live for many free fall times , i.e. @xmath22 is large in a subset of gmcs .",
    "the third factor in the third bracket in equation ( [ eq : gmceps2 ] ) explain why @xmath21 can also be _ smaller _ than @xmath9 .",
    "finally , @xmath21 can be boosted if the observed @xmath0 mass is significantly less than @xmath12 , i.e. if gmcs lose ( in one way or another ) a large fraction of their molecular hydrogen over their life time .",
    "the latter scenario predicts that @xmath16 should roughly scale @xmath23 over the life time of _ individual _ gmcs .",
    "an observational sample of an _ ensemble _ of gmcs shows this trend @xcite .",
    "however , this trend can also be produced by a selection effect based on stellar mass , e.g. selecting gmcs with @xmath24 excludes values of @xmath21 that are smaller than @xmath25 , see equation ( [ eq : gmceta ] ) . in fact , @xcite is selecting clouds based on ionizing luminosities , which roughly corresponds to selecting clouds based the stellar mass formed within the last 4 myr .",
    "such a selection effect explains why a different study of @xmath26 gmcs find much lower efficiencies @xcite .",
    "the existence of the selection effect is _ not _ an argument against or in favor of an evolving @xmath1 , rather it shows that the gmcs with large values of @xmath21 in the sample of @xcite are likely a heavily biased subset . in the case that @xmath1 is , in fact , a non evolving quantity and the measured large values of @xmath21 are driven by changing molecular gas masses , we can make a rather generic prediction .",
    "the similarity of the scaling with gmc mass vs. @xmath14 for the data presented in @xcite gives a slope of @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of our toy model ( slope @xmath28 , see section [ sect : model ] ) that takes into account that , in fact , not the total stellar mass has been measured , but only the stellar mass formed within the last @xmath8 4 myr . ]",
    "( @xmath23 ) of @xmath21 , on the one hand , and the lower boundary of the region excluded by the discussed selection effect , on the other hand , implies that the observed gmcs with large values of @xmath21 should have rather similar _ maximal _",
    "@xmath0 masses @xmath12 .",
    "the toy model that we discuss in section [ sect : model ] predicts @xmath29 .",
    "we note that this scenario explains rather naturally the absence of massive ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) gmcs with high values of @xmath21 .",
    "a different issue can arise if one compares star formation rates and @xmath0 masses in order to estimate @xmath32 via equation ( [ eq : dotmstar ] ) .",
    "for example , let us assume that we measure sfrs and @xmath0 masses within small ( @xmath7 pc ) apertures around peaks of co emission ( tracing the @xmath0 mass ) and peaks of @xmath33 emission ( tracing star formation rates ) , see e.g. @xcite . if we observe that co peaks have lower sfrs at given @xmath0 mass compared with peaks of @xmath33 emission ,",
    "does this imply a time - varying @xmath32 ?",
    "the answer to that question depends on the way the sfrs are measured .",
    "sfrs that are derived from @xmath33 emission are effectively averaged over the past 5 - 10 myr , which might well be a significant fraction of the life time of the molecular cloud . for sfrs that are based on @xmath33+@xmath34 emission",
    "this averaging time span would be even longer .",
    "the star formation efficiencies per free - fall time that are estimated from such a time averaged sfr will be small initially ( no stars have been formed over most of the time averaging interval simply because the gmc has only formed recently ) .",
    "the measured sfrs will increase until the age of the gmc is similar to the averaging time span .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 mass of the cloud might evolve ( possibly decrease ) leading to an additional increase in the apparent value of @xmath32 with time .",
    "if the following three conditions are satisfied , a difference in the measured sfr per measured @xmath0 mass can provide strong evidence for a time - varying star formation efficiency per free fall time .",
    "first , the averaging times of the sfrs need to be small compared to ages of the observed clouds .",
    "second , the observable @xmath0 reservoirs need to be close to @xmath12 , and , finally , the free fall times of the clouds need to be known . a recent study that measures sfrs with reasonably short averaging times ( 2 myr , @xcite ) estimates star formation efficiencies per free fall time of the order of @xmath35 for most clouds in the sample , with the scatter mostly driven by the mass of molecular gas of relatively low density ( @xmath36 @xmath37 ) that does not participate in the star formation",
    "we will now discuss a toy model in order to both exemplify the points made in section [ sect : pitfalls ] , but also to provide a framework in which we can make some quantitative predictions .",
    "we should stress that the statements made in the previous section are completely generic and do not depend on the specific assumption that go into the model that we are going to present .",
    "our model is almost insultingly simple , and , given that , our aim is not to reproduce the full complexity in the evolution of gmcs or even , to be consistent with any available observation . on the other hand",
    "the model offers a pragmatic approach to the mass evolution of gmcs and may be easily generalized to facilitate more complex scenarios .",
    "the ansatz of the model is to supplement equation ( [ eq : dotmstar ] ) with an equivalent equation that describes the evolution of the @xmath0 mass : @xmath38 the extra term @xmath39 is motivated by assuming that stellar feedback is limiting the life time of molecular clouds , e.g. via photo - ionization , thermal pressure or radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "this feedback should therefore couple to the formed stellar mass via some efficiency factor @xmath40 that sets the time scale for the destruction / removal of @xmath0 from the cloud should refer to the total stellar mass times a weight parameter that takes into account that feedback is provided by stars which have a limited life time .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that @xmath13 is the total amount of stellar mass formed within the cloud . ] .",
    "the term @xmath41 is the net `` accretion '' rate of @xmath0 , which includes all processes that create and destroy @xmath0 and are not directly coupled to either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath41 could in principle be time dependent . for simplicity",
    "we assume that they are constant .",
    "our model is minimalistic ( compared with , e.g. , @xcite ) , but it has the advantage that we can parametrize our ignorance of the relevant physical processes that destroy and disperse the cloud into the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "together with appropriate initial conditions equations ( [ eq : dotmstar ] ) and ( [ eq : dotmgas ] ) fully determine the evolution of the masses of molecular hydrogen and the stellar component in a gmc .",
    "we will also make the simplifying assumption that the free - fall time does not evolve strongly over the history of the gmc , i.e. both the star formation efficiency per free fall time and the star formation time scale are now fixed .",
    "this assumption is not crucial for the model , but we will use it for the following reasons .",
    "first , there is no clear systematic trend of free fall time with mass over the range of gmcs that we are comparing to , see e.g. table 2 of @xcite .",
    "second , assuming a non - evolving free - fall time allows for a convenient analytical solution of the problem .",
    "third , we find that even with this assumption our model describes the observed data reasonably well .",
    "we stress that our main aim is to show that a simple model can produce an observational signal that could be misinterpreted as evidence for evolution of the star formation efficiencies .",
    "we do not try to model the precise properties of the ensemble of gmcs in the galaxy .    with @xmath2 fixed ( and , of course , we assume that the star formation efficiency per free fall time is a constant , too ) we can insert ( [ eq : dotmstar ] ) into ( [ eq : dotmgas ] ) and obtain a linear 2nd order differential equation for @xmath14 , i.e. the equation of a damped harmonic oscillator .        * _ no accretion scenario : _ assumes @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "it follows @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . *",
    "_ pure accretion scenario : _ assumes that all @xmath0 is `` accreted '' , i.e. @xmath52 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 . in this case phase and amplitude",
    "are given by @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "we adopt the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 myr , which are consistent with observations of @xmath1 over a range of density scales @xcite , and with the free fall times @xmath58 myr measured in the sample of @xcite , respectively .",
    "we note that only the ratio @xmath59 myr@xmath60 enters our model .",
    "the @xmath40 parameter is chosen such that the life time of the cloud , i.e. the time @xmath61 at which @xmath62 , is @xmath63 myr @xcite . hence , we use @xmath64 in the no accretion scenario and @xmath65 in the pure accretion scenario , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath66 the life time of a gmc is given by @xmath67 the left ( right ) expression refers to the no accretion ( pure accretion ) scenario .",
    "we note that in both considered scenarios the life time does not depend on the initial cloud mass or the accretion rate , respectively .",
    "the evolution of @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath68 normalized to @xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm ] .       in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps ] we show the predictions for @xmath21 and @xmath69 of the two scenarios of our model , together with @xmath1 and @xmath9 , and the observational data from @xcite . to be consistent with observations only the stellar mass that formed within the last 4 myr is included in the definition @xmath21 , see ( [ eq : gmceta ] ) , and @xmath69 is estimated as @xmath70 .",
    "our model reproduces the trends of @xmath21 and @xmath69 with gmc mass , suggesting that these are maybe not solely due to selection effects . in both scenarios @xmath21 and @xmath69 roughly scale as @xmath71 over the mass range @xmath72 - @xmath73 .    with the chosen parameters our model predicts that @xmath21 is only significantly larger than @xmath9 for the last @xmath74 myr in the life of a gmc , this includes most of the gmcs with masses less than @xmath75 in the sample of @xcite .",
    "we note that the precise time does depend on the assumed life time of the cloud .",
    "clouds with shorter life times spend _ more _ time in a state in which @xmath76 .",
    "our model exemplifies that it is difficult to prove the existence of a time - varying star formation efficiency based on observational quantities such as @xmath21 or @xmath69 .",
    "this is not to say that such a time - dependence does not exist , we merely conclude that current observational evidence for its existence is insufficient ."
