    "the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are most naturally described by the so - called `` fireball '' model ( see e.g. , paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1993 , 1997 ; waxman 1997a , b ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) . in this model ,",
    "a compact source releases a large amount of energy over a short time and produces a relativistically expanding fireball .",
    "eventually the fireball interacts with the circumburst medium , producing a spherical relativistic shock in it . as the shock decelerates due to the accumulation of mass from the external medium , it approaches a self - similar solution (",
    "blandford & mckee 1976 ) and produces delayed synchrotron emission in x - rays , optical and radio , similar to the observed afterglows .",
    "the model generically yields power - law spectra and lightcurves in general agreement with observations at x - ray ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , optical ( van paradijs et al . 1997 ) and radio ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) wavelengths .",
    "precise positions have allowed redshifts to be measured for a number of grbs ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , providing a definitive proof of their cosmological origin .",
    "recent observational evidence indicates that at least some grb are not spherical explosions .",
    "a broad - band break in the lightcurve power - law index was predicted for shocks produced by collimated jets due to the lateral expansion of the jet when its lorentz factor drops below the inverse of its opening angle ( rhoads 1997 , 1999a , b ; panaitescu & mszros 1999 ) .",
    "such breaks have been seen in grb  990510 ( stanek et al . 1999 ; harrison et al . 1999 ) , grb  991216 ( halpern et al .",
    "2000 ) , and grb  000301c ( sagar et al .",
    "2000 ; masetti et al . 2000 ; jensen et al . 2000 ; berger et al .",
    "the ratio of the spectral index to the light curve index also suggests non - spherical energy ejection for some events ( e.g. grb  991216 : garnavich et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the possibility that grbs are associated with a rare sub - class of supernovae ( sne ) was advocated recently based on a possible sn component in the lightcurves of grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ) and the association of sn1998bw with grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this case",
    "the grb emission needs to be beamed in order to achieve the high lorentz factor required for grb outflows , despite the massive progenitor envelope and the low energy yield of sne ( macfadyen , woosley , & heger 1999 ; khokhlov at al .",
    "1999 ; umeda 2000 ) .",
    "the current state of knowledge leaves two major questions open : ( i ) are grbs associated with rare sne ? ; and ( ii ) if so , what is the characteristic collimation angle of the energy release ?",
    "the collimation angle has important implications on the nature of the central engine .",
    "if the average angular radius of the two opposing jets in collimated grbs is @xmath1 , then the total energy release will be reduced by a factor @xmath4 and the event rate will be increased by the inverse of this factor . in this paper",
    "we propose a direct observational probe that will help answer these questions .",
    "when a transient relativistic jet ( equivalent to a relativistic `` bullet '' ) moves into the circumburst medium ( be it the interstellar medium or a progenitor wind ) , a bow shock is generated in front of the jet .",
    "the bow shock accelerates electrons which emit synchrotron radiation , similarly to the primary shock in front of the jet . for observers situated within the cone of the jet emission ,",
    "the bow shock emission will be sub - dominant relative to the jet emission due to relativistic motion of the jet towards the observer .",
    "however , for highly collimated outflows , most lines of sight lie outside the jet cone , and for those  the bow shock emission may dominate .",
    "in particular , if grbs originate in sne then the bow shock emission will add a strong non - thermal component to the emission from the sn remnants extending from the radio to the x - ray bands .",
    "this emission will extend over much longer times compared to the jet emission since the lorentz factor of the bow shock is typically much smaller than that of the jet , resulting in a smaller relativistic compression of time in the observer s frame . in the following sections we will apply the same model used ordinarily for the primary fireball shock , to calculate the flux in this non - thermal bow - shock component . in ",
    "2 we present our model for the bow shock emission ; in  3 we show our numerical results ; and finally , in  4 , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the impulsive ejection of a relativistic jet from the grb source results in a thin disk of material moving outwards and expanding , which we refer to as a _",
    "relativistic bullet_. as long as the angular radius of the bullet relative to the center of the explosion , @xmath1 , is much larger than the inverse of its lorentz factor , the bullet will expand as if it is part of a spherically symmetric fireball .",
    "this follows from the relativistic transformation of velocities , which implies that the propagation speed of a signal in the perpendicular direction to the bullet motion can not exceed @xmath5 in the frame of the stationary ambient medium . for simplicity ,",
    "we limit our discussion to this regime .    in our model",
    "we assume that as the relativistic _ bullet _ moves through the ambient medium , it deposits a fraction of its kinetic energy in each infinitesimal distance it travels .",
    "we treat this energy deposition as a sequence of point explosions , which drive shocks into the surrounding medium . the combination of this sequence of small shocks results in a conical bow shock structure behind the bullet .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the geometry of the bow shock .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates , with the @xmath6-axis connecting the bullet center to the source . the distance between the source and the bullet",
    "is denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that observers are located perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis , with @xmath8 along the source - observer axis .",
    "next we consider a slice of the bow shock geometry perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the slice is a cylindrical shell of height @xmath9 , thickness @xmath10 and inner radius @xmath11 .",
    "as the bullet passes through a point @xmath6 it has a radius @xmath12 and a lorentz factor @xmath13 .",
    "the amount of thermal energy @xmath14 which gets deposited by the bullet in the surrounding medium as it moves an extra distance @xmath9 , is then given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron number density of the external medium , and @xmath17 is the ion mass per electron .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath18 of the energy stored in the `` causally - connected '' edge of the bullet is transferred to the external medium .",
    "the `` causally - connected '' edge of the bullet is defined to be the region occupying an angular size @xmath19 from the bullet edge .",
    "the energy deposited in the infinitesimal distance interval @xmath9 drives a shock into the ambient gas .",
    "the gas behind the shock is piled into an outgoing thin shell .",
    "the shock expands perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis , but due to the time delay between the energy deposition at different points along the @xmath6-axis , the sum of the fronts generated by these points defines a conical shape for the resulting bow shock .",
    "we denote the lorentz factor of the outgoing shell in the frame of the unshocked gas by @xmath0 . the electron number density @xmath20 and internal energy density @xmath21 of the shocked gas in the frame comoving with the shell can be written as ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the adiabatic index of the shocked gas which changes from @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the shock velocity changes from the relativistic to the non - relativistic regime .",
    "we interpolate between these regimes using the simplified expression @xmath27 ( dai , huang & lu 1999 ) . equations ( [ eq : n ] ) and ( [ eq : e ] ) then become @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq : nnew ] ) and ( [ eq : enew ] ) are appropriate for both the relativistic and non - relativistic regimes .",

    "we therefore obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 . the thickness of the shell is derived by using the conservation of particle number .",
    "this yields @xmath37    figure 2 illustrates the geometry of the emission from an infinitesimal volume element in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath38 .",
    "we define the emission coefficient @xmath39 to be the power emitted per unit frequency , @xmath40 , per unit volume per steradian in the rest frame of the emitting material .",
    "we use prime to denote quantities in the local rest frame of the emitting material , while unprimed quantities are measured in the rest frame of the external medium . note that @xmath41 is lorentz invariant ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . for each slice ,",
    "the cylindrical shell of expanding material emits isotropically in its local rest frame with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath0 and @xmath44 are the lorentz factor and the velocity of the emitting material , and @xmath45 .",
    "a photon emitted at time @xmath46 and place @xmath47 in the unshocked gas frame will reach the detector at a time @xmath48 given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cosmological redshift of the grb and @xmath48 is chosen so that a photon emitted at the grb source at @xmath51 will arrive to the detector at @xmath52 .",

    "should be taken over the region occupied by the emitting bow shock at a given observed time .",

    ", we assume that the energy densities of the shock - accelerated electrons and the magnetic field are fixed fractions of the internal energy density in the shell behind the bow shock , @xmath61 , and that the bow shock produces a power law distribution of accelerated electrons with a number density per lorentz factor of @xmath62 for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 when the bow shock is nonrelativistic , we use @xmath65 to denote the fraction of the internal energy which goes to relativistic electrons with @xmath66 . again",
    ", these relativistic electrons obtain a power law distribution @xmath67 for @xmath63 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "this is justified by the similarity between the parameter values which are typically chosen to describe relativistic grb afterglows ( e.g. , waxman 1997a , b ) and non - relativistic radio supernovae ( e.g. , chevalier 1998 ) .    at sufficiently high lorentz factors ,",

    "we show results only for the initial period during which @xmath143 , since our model does not apply to later times when the lateral expansion of the bullet is important .",

    "therefore , case 2 has lower peak luminosities and higher cooling frequencies .",
    "the observation time calculated in this case is also longer because it takes more time for the bullet to decelerate .",
    "case 3 has a higher input energy than the standard case , but its peak luminosities are almost the same as those of the standard case . also it has lower peak frequencies and higher cooling frequencies .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the bullet has more kinetic energy , and so its deceleration requires more time and a longer distance . as a result , the density of the wind is lower than that of the standard case when the bow shock emission is calculated .",
    "case 4 assumes @xmath148 , implying that more energy is deposited into the bow shock by the bullet .",
    "compared to the standard case , this case has a higher peak luminosity and a lower cooling frequency .",
    "case 5 assumes a lower value for @xmath75 .",
    "compared to the standard case , it has a somewhat lower peak luminosity and a higher peak frequency .",
    "case 6 considers the ism as the ambient medium , implying a much lower electron density than the standard case with a wind profile .",
    "consequently , the peak luminosity and the peak frequency are lower , while the cooling frequency is higher .",
    "also note that in this case the peak luminosity increases with time , in contrast to the standard case .    with these results at hand , we may now compare the thermal emission from the main supernova shock with the non - thermal emission from the grb bow - shock in the optical regime .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been used as `` standard candles '' because they all have similar light curves and peak absolute magnitudes .",
    "the absolute @xmath149-magnitude at maximum light ( @xmath150 ) of typical sne ia is @xmath151 ( vaughan et al .",
    "1995 ) , corresponding to @xmath152 at @xmath153 .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude more luminous than the emission from the grb bow - shock in our calculation .",
    "type ii supernovae can be generally divided into two relatively distinct sub - classes , sne ii - l ( `` linear '' ) and sne ii - p ( `` plateau '' ) . the majority of sne",
    "ii - l have a nearly uniform peak absolute magnitude , though there are a few exceptionally luminous sne ii - l ( young & branch 1989 ; gaskell 1992 ; filippenko 1997 ) .",
    "the average @xmath150 of the majority of sne ii - l is @xmath154 ( gaskell 1992 ) , corresponding to @xmath155 .",
    "this is still more than one order of magnitude brighter than the emission from the grb bow - shock .",
    "but if the emission from the bow - shock persists for a sufficiently long time ( as in case 3 of our calculation ) , then it may exceed the thermal sne ii - l emission due to the decline in the supernova lightcurve .",
    "sne ii - p show a very wide dispersion in the distribution of their peak absolute magnitudes ; i.e. , @xmath150 spans the range from -14 to -20 ( young & branch 1989 ) , corresponding to @xmath156  @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the less luminous sne ii - p ( such as sn1987a ) , have peak luminosities in @xmath149-band which are comparable to the emission from the grb bow - shock .",
    "of course , grbs may occur in a rare subset of supernovae that have very different optical luminosities than the typical values mentioned above .",
    "the bow shock emission is more easily detectable at either radio or x - ray frequencies . at a frequency of @xmath158 ghz ,",
    "most radio supernovae which reached their peak between 10 and 130 days had a peak spectral luminosity @xmath159 between @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( li & chevalier 1999 , fig .",

    "sn 1980k had a luminosity of @xmath170 in the 0.2 - 4 kev band on day 44 and sn 1994i had a luminosity of @xmath171 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band between day 79 and day 85 .",
