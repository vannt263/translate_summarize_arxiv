    "the mass and age distributions of star cluster systems contain the ( fossil ) records of their formation conditions .",
    "they are therefore among the best tracers of the star - formation histories of their host galaxies available to observers .",
    "it is important to realise , however , that one needs to understand both the dominant internal and external evolutionary processes in order to disentangle this formation record , and hence obtain a glimpse of the initial conditions required for star cluster formation .",
    "the effects of stellar evolution in a given star cluster ( which can be approximated by a `` simple '' stellar population once the cluster has reached an age that is well in excess of its formation time - scale ) are rather well understood , whereas we have only recently begun to make major _ quantitative _ inroads into understanding the environmental effects leading to star cluster `` weight loss '' ( i.e. , the preferential depletion of the low - mass component of the cluster s stellar mass function caused by tidal stripping and the ejection of stars owing to internal two - body relaxation ) and  eventually  disruption .",
    "estimates of the characteristic cluster disruption time - scales in various star cluster environments have been calculated by boutloukos & lamers ( 2003 ) , de grijs et al .",
    "( 2003a , b , c ) , gieles et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) , among others ( see also lamers et al . 2005a , b ) .",
    "specifically , boutloukos & lamers ( 2003 ) and lamers et al .",
    "( 2005b ) show that the cluster age distribution and cluster mass function approximate a double power law when a cluster system is affected by both fading and secular dynamical evolution .",
    "knowledge of the detection limit in terms of cluster mass vs. age , combined with the estimate of the cluster age or mass at the `` break point '' of the integrated cluster age ( mass ) distribution ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1 in boutloukos & lamers 2003 , where the `` break points '' are referred to as @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the age and mass distributions , respectively ) then leads to the typical cluster disruption time - scale .",
    "their analysis , however , explicitly builds on the assumption of a constant cluster formation rate ( cfr , i.e. the number of clusters formed per linear time interval @xmath16 is constant in time ) as a function of time . in that context",
    ", the ( poorly - known ) time - variable cfr of the lmc cluster system hampers such an analysis .",
    "if only the observed cluster age distribution is known , then we are left with a degeneracy between the cfr and the disruption time - scale , in the sense that one can not distinguish between a low cfr combined with slow secular dynamical evolution on the one hand , and a vigourous cfr combined with cluster disruption occurring on a rapid time - scale on the other .",
    "the star cluster system in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has the potential of providing strong constraints to the theory of star cluster disruption as a function of environment , since it is composed of the largest resolved cluster system spanning _ both _ a reasonable mass range ( @xmath17 m@xmath4 ; cf .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter h03 ; de grijs & anders 2006 , and references therein ) _ and _ an age range from a few myr to @xmath18 gyr available .",
    "in addition , thanks to the lmc s proximity , we have been able to obtain observations  and derived the age and mass distributions  of a sufficiently large cluster sample to allow a statistical approach to its evolution ( e.g. , h03 ; de grijs & anders 2006 ; see also sect .",
    "2 ) .    on the basis of the few star clusters systems analysed in detail to date , including m51 and the antennae interacting system , bastian et al . ( 2005 ) , fall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and fall ( 2006 ) suggest that the early evolution of star cluster systems is most likely characterised by a rapid , largely mass - independent `` infant mortality '' phase , at least for masses @xmath19 m@xmath4 ( see also de grijs & parmentier 2007 ; and references therein ) , combined with `` infant weight loss''(the loss of stars caused by rapid , early gas expulsion ; cf .",
    "weidner et al .",
    "2007 ) , the effects of which are enhanced by stellar evolutionary mass loss . in this scenario , this early phase , which ends when clusters reach an age of @xmath20 to 50 myr ( e.g. , goodwin & bastian 2006 ) , would then be followed by ( mass - dependent ) secular evolution .",
    "the early , rapid cluster disruption process results from the expulsion of the intracluster gas due to adiabatic or explosive expansion driven by stellar winds or supernova activity ( mengel et al .",
    "2005 ; bastian & goodwin 2006 ; goodwin & bastian 2006 ; see de grijs & parmentier 2007 for a review ) .",
    "star clusters are expected to settle back into virial equilibrium @xmath20 to 50 myr after gas expulsion ( goodwin & bastian 2006 ) . in our analysis in this paper",
    "we will therefore exclude star clusters younger than 50 myr , since our main purpose is to derive the characteristic ( mass - dependent ) time - scale of cluster disruption in the lmc driven by secular evolution only . in a follow - up paper ( goodwin et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , we will discuss the evolution of the lmc cluster system on the shortest time - scales relevant to the infant mortality and infant weight loss scenarios .    in de grijs & anders ( 2006 )",
    ", we found that the lmc s cfr has been roughly constant outside of the well - known age gap between @xmath21 and 13 gyr , when the cfr was a factor of @xmath22 lower ( assuming a roughly constant rate during this entire period ) .",
    "based on this observation as our main underlying assumption , we used a simple approach to derive the characteristic cluster disruption time - scale in the lmc , for which we found that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( boutloukos & lamers 2003 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; gieles et al .",
    "we argued that this was consistent with earlier , preliminary work done on a smaller cluster sample : boutloukos & lamers ( 2002 ) found @xmath25 for a smaller sample of 478 clusters within 5 kpc from the centre of the lmc , in the age range @xmath26 .",
    "we also considered our result qualitatively consistent with hunter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who noticed very little destruction of clusters at the high - mass end .",
    "this long characteristic disruption time - scale would imply that hardly any of our lmc sample clusters are affected by significant disruptive processes , so that we are in fact observing the _ initial _ cluster mass function ( cmf ) .    however , a close inspection of fig . 6 of de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) highlights an apparent contradiction .",
    "the `` crossing time '' , @xmath27 , defined by the crossing point between the best - fitting lines describing the number of clusters per unit time - scale that are mostly affected by fading of their stellar populations and those that are undergoing significant secular disruption , seems to imply that a more appropriate time - scale for the disruption of the lmc cluster system may be of order @xmath28 . since this implies a downward adjustment of the characteristic cluster disruption time - scale in the lmc by up to an order of magnitude , we decided to re - investigate the lmc s cluster disruption history .    here , we approach this problem from a different angle , by running a large number of monte - carlo simulations in which we vary the cluster disruption time - scale .",
    "meanwhile , for each of these cluster disruption time - scales we derive the corresponding cfr required to reproduce the observed cluster age distribution .",
    "we then match the observed cluster mass distribution , integrated over time , and the observed two - dimensional distribution of the detected surviving clusters in the log(mass ) vs. log(age ) plane to the model results .",
    "@xmath1 fit estimates are used to quantify which cluster disruption time - scale and , therefore , which cluster formation history , best describes the presently available data .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : data ] we justify our choices used in the data analysis leading to the cluster age and mass distributions used in the remainder of the paper .",
    "section [ sec : synth ] discusses our basic assumptions in constructing synthetic cluster populations , which we then use in section [ sec : disr ] to explore the range of characteristic cluster disruption time - scales allowed by the data . in section [ sec : comp ] we highlight the importance of properly understanding the data s completeness limit , and use this in section [ sec : agap ] to constrain possible variations in the cfr over time . in section [ sec:1vs10 ] , we assess precisely what we would need to fully and unambiguously constrain @xmath5 .",

    "the basis for our detailed re - analysis of the magellanic clouds star cluster systems is provided by the @xmath29 broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of h03 , based on massey s ( 2002 ) ccd survey of the magellanic clouds .    in a series of recent papers",

    "as such , we adopted the conservative approach that the present - day lmc cluster luminosity function ( clf ; see h03 s fig .",
    "4 ) is best represented by a power - law function in luminosity .",
    "we obtained the best - fitting power law to the lmc s clf for @xmath39 mag , where we assume the cluster sample to be affected by negligible incompleteness .",

    "once divided by the number of bins minus the number of degrees of freedom , we obtain the reduced _ ppl _ , which we refer to as @xmath73 .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , to infer an estimate ( or a range of estimates , as we will see below ) for the cluster disruption time - scale is equivalent to deducing the temporal evolution of the lmc s cfr over the past 1.5gyr ( i.e. , up to the upper age limit we consider at the present stage of our analysis ) .    first , we simulated the evolution of 20 putative star cluster systems .",

    "the cluster systems differ with respect to their cluster disruption time - scales , for which twenty values were tested , i.e. , @xmath74 to 10.0 in steps of 0.1 dex . we then normalise the evolved cluster age / mass distributions so that they contain a constant number of 375 clusters , to match the observations . the initial distributions ( e.g. , the cfr )",
    "follow from this . as a result",
    ", a shorter cluster disruption time - scale implies a higher cfr , in order to maintain the present number of observed clusters despite more vigourous disruption . in practice , the cfr for @xmath75 is ten times higher than for @xmath76 ( see top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : cstcfr ] ) .    when the cluster disruption time - scale is long ( e.g. , @xmath77 ) , the decrease in the number of evolved clusters per time unit as a function of increasing age is dominated by fading effects .",
    "the slope of the age distribution therefore mirrors the slope @xmath78 of the lower mass limit over time in ( @xmath79 ) space and is @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the cluster disruption time - scale is short ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) , the slope of the age distribution is mostly determined by disruption and follows @xmath83 ( see boutloukos & lamers 2003 for an in - depth discussion ) .    from the observed age distribution alone , one may deduce that the characteristic disruption time - scale of a @xmath54 cluster in the lmc is close to 100 myr .",
    "shown graphically , in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cstcfr ] , the lower dotted curve ( corresponding to the age distribution for @xmath84 ) follows the data points better than the dash - dotted curve ( i.e. , the age distribution for @xmath85 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the predicted age distribution is shallower ( with a slope @xmath86 ) than the observed cluster age distribution ( exhibiting a slope @xmath87 ) .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath73 for the age distribution ( i.e. , the long - dashed curve with the filled circles in fig .  [ fig : xhi2_cst ] ) , which shows a steeply rising @xmath73 for @xmath88 myr .",
    "the ( @xmath5 , @xmath73 ) relation for the cluster mass spectrum integrated over age paints a completely different picture , however .",
    "the short cluster disruption time - scale derived from the age distribution alone now results in a four times larger @xmath73 than for @xmath89gyr ( the solid line with filled squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : xhi2_cst ] ) .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cstcfr ] illustrates that if @xmath90 , the evolved cluster mass spectrum above @xmath91 is significantly shallower than the observed cmf , of which the slope remains close to that of the icmf in that mass range .",
    "better fits to the evolved cmf are obtained for @xmath92 and 9.9 .",
    "this discrepancy between two different estimators for the model goodness - of - fit , @xmath73 from the age distribution and @xmath73 from the mass distribution , suggests an inconsistent hypothesis , presumably the assumption of a constant cfr .",
    "it is worth emphasising that a possibly variable cfr in the lmc should not be considered as an obstacle to the derivation of the cluster disruption time - scale . any sufficiently old , coeval subsample of clusters is suitable to infer it , as long as the imprint of the secular dynamical evolution can be detected .",
    "in fact , the limited age range of a coeval population ensures that temporal cfr variations can safely be ignored .",
    "the imprint of the secular dynamical evolution leads to a turn - over in the cmf .",
    "provided that the shape of the icmf is known , the disruption time - scale for the relevant environmental conditions can be derived from the combination of the mean cluster age and of the cluster mass at the cmf turn - over ( see section [ sec:1vs10 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tevol_msp ] ) .",
    "this argument is supported by our recent study of the roughly coeval intermediate - age cluster population in m82 b ( de grijs , parmentier & lamers 2005 ; but see also smith et al .",
    "2007 for updated m82 b data ) .    in the following , we build on this principle .",
    "specifically , we split the cluster age range under consideration , @xmath93 , into five subranges , each with a width of @xmath94 ( i.e. , the size of a cell in fig .  [ fig : obs_am ] ) .",
    "we assume that these age bins are narrow enough so that each can be characterised by a single cfr .",
    "for each of the twenty disruption time - scales explored , we first assume a constant cfr and we derive the corresponding age distribution of the observed survivors . from the comparison between the modelled and the observed age distributions the cfr",
    "is adjusted so that the distributions match each other .",
    "this is illustrated in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : varcfr ] .",
    "varying the cluster disruption time - scale now leads to distinct cluster formation histories , not only with respect to the mean cfr , but also with respect to its temporal variations .",
    "if the cluster disruption time - scale is @xmath95 , the cfr is almost constant and of order 100 clusters per myr .",
    "this is consistent with what we concluded above ( see the top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : cstcfr ] ) . from that same figure",
    ", we also found that if the cfr is constant and if @xmath96 or 9.9 , the derived age distribution is shallower than observed .",
    "as a result , for such a long cluster disruption time - scale , the lmc cluster age distribution can be matched only by adopting a cfr that decreases with increasing age ( compare the top panels of figs .  [",
    "fig : cstcfr ] and [ fig : varcfr ] ) .",
    "once an appropriate cfr has been adopted for each age bin , the construction of a consistent integrated cluster mass distribution follows naturally ( see the bottom panel of fig .  [",

    "whether the first star clusters to form in the universe ( i.e. globular clusters ) are characterised by that icmf , typical of young star clusters in the galactic disc and in starbursts and mergers ( zhang & fall 1999 ) , or by a gaussian similar to their present - day cmf ( vesperini 1998 ; parmentier & gilmore 2005 , 2007 ) remains a matter of ongoing debate .",
    "it is not our aim in this section to discuss the true nature of the icmf in the lmc 13 gyr ago .",
    "we are prevented from doing so by the paucity of data above the fiducial detection limit at old age .",
    "however , it is worth emphasising that the fraction by number of clusters that survive to old age crucially depends on their icmf . as an illustration ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath212gyr .",
    "the disruption time - scale of a @xmath213 cluster is then about 10gyr ( eq .  [ eq : tdis ] , assuming @xmath147 ) and all clusters of masses between @xmath214 and @xmath213 will have evaporated by the time their age reaches a hubble time . if star clusters formed with an icmf spectral index @xmath215 , this implies a decrease by @xmath211 3 orders of magnitude in the initial number of clusters .",
    "on the other hand , if old lmc clusters formed following the universal gaussian cmf characteristic of present - day globular cluster systems , clusters more massive than @xmath213 account for about one half of the initial cluster census , thereby implying a survival rate of @xmath211 50 per cent . also , the cluster survival rates in terms of mass and in terms of number are similar in that case ( see table 3 in parmentier & gilmore  2005 for a comparison of the galactic halo cluster survival rates in case of power - law and gaussian icmfs ) .",
    "since the survival rates of clusters ( in terms of number ) at old age depend _ heavily _ on their icmf , so does the inferred cfr .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ad_oldg ] , we consider the universal globular cluster mass function for the oldest age bin . in other words , in the age range @xmath216 , we substitute the power - law icmf of slope @xmath170 assumed thus far by a gaussian icmf with a mean logarithmic cluster mass of 5.3 and a standard deviation of 0.6 dex . at first glance",
    ", the evolution of the cfr looks rather noisy .",
    "the very low cfr at old age ( 3 and 1 clusters gyr@xmath9 for @xmath217 and 9.9 , respectively ) is followed by a steep rise amounting to a factor of order 300 , which is subsequently succeeded by a 3-fold decrease leading to the age gap .    however , because the cfr is directly determined from the present - day age distribution , they are both affected by the same uncertainties . at ages older than 3gyr , the @xmath218 error bars of the age distribution become significantly larger than at younger ages , as a result of the smaller number of clusters .",
    "the cfr at intermediate and old ages becomes similarly uncertain . in order to highlight this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ad_oldg ] we plot the poissonian error bars of the four oldest bins of the age distribution on the cfr for @xmath219 . from this simple exercice",
    ", it appears that the cfr may have steadily increased from a very low value of about 1 to 3 clusters per gyr some 15gyr ago , up to a @xmath220 times higher rate 2 gyr ago .",
    "this steady increase in the cfr is indicated by the thick dashed line in fig.[fig : ad_oldg ] ; this is compatible with the four oldest age bins within @xmath218 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the well - established age gap in the lmc cluster age distribution may not be a faithful mirror of the underlying cfr .",
    "this is mainly owing to the assumption that all star clusters were formed in a power - law fashion . for this scenario ,",
    "the cfr develops a minimum at about 5gyr ago , and increases towards both older and younger ages around the age gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ad_all ] ) .",
    "however , if the icmf at the oldest age is different , and similar to the observed gaussian globular cluster mass function , the resulting bias towards greater cluster mass boosts the number fraction of surviving clusters , thus resulting in a much lower cfr at old age . in the latter case ,",
    "the cfr has steadily increased over the past hubble time ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ad_oldg ] ) .",
    "although , in that model , the cfr is increasing by about 2 orders of magnitude from 16gyr ago to 8gyr ago , the corresponding variations of the formation rate in terms of cluster _ mass _ are not that significant .",
    "referring to the thick dashed curve in fig.[fig : ad_oldg ] ( i.e. that mimicing the smooth and steady cfr increase with time ) , the cfr in the last and last but one age bins are @xmath221 cluster per gyr and @xmath222 clusters per gyr , respectively .",
    "owing to a different underlying icmf , these two subsequent age bins are also characterized by markedly different initial mean cluster mass , @xmath223 for an @xmath0 power - law icmf and @xmath224 for the universal gaussian icmf .",

    "( 2007 ) re - examine the orbital history of the clouds on the basis of the most recent proper motion measurements available ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "they find that the existence of a stable binary lmc - smc system lasting for a hubble time can not be precluded , although that remains uncertain .",
    "the present status of the orbital history of the magellanic clouds about the galaxy is equally questionable . according to most previous studies ,",
    "the lmc has completed several pericentric passages about the galaxy in a hubble time .",
    "besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reached the opposite conclusion , however , that the lmc - smc pair of galaxies may be on their first passage about the milky way .",
    "the orbital history of the lmc remains therefore poorly constrained .",
    "and so are the origins of the temporal variations of its cfr",
    ". why did it increase from 3gyr ago ?",
    "whereas bekki & chiba ( 2005 ) advocate violent and close interactions with the smc , besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) favour a scenario in which interactions with the galaxy are the dominant factor .",
    "in fact , the cfr increase from @xmath21gyr ago is a natural consequence of their first - passage scenario , as this corresponds to when the magellanic clouds first enter inside the virial radius of the milky way and begin to interact with the galactic halo gas .",
    "finally , we are left with the question as to whether cluster formation in the lmc was in fact reactivated some 3 to 4 gyr ago ( i.e. , the icmf at old age is a power law of spectral index @xmath0 ) or whether this increase is merely a continuation of a process started @xmath231gyr ago ( i.e. , the icmf at old ages is the universal gaussian globular cluster mass function ) .",
    "a decrease in the cfr from 15gyr ago until @xmath22gyr ago may be understood in the context of a scenario in which the evolution of the lmc - smc - milky way system is not considered in isolation but , instead , in the wider context of the evolution of the entire local group of galaxies .",

    "( 1994 ) considered the possibility that the magellanic clouds left the neighbourhood of the andromeda galaxy about 10 gyr ago and were only recently tidally captured by the milky way .",
    "while recent tidal capture by the milky way could have reactivated cluster formation , the decreasing cluster formation rate from the earliest stages may then result from the lmc moving to greater distances from m31 . yet , this scenario is not supported by besla et al.s ( 2007 ) computations . on the other hand , the steady increase in fig .  [",
    "fig : ad_oldg ] may result from the lmc getting closer to the milky way , in the context of the first perigalactic passage scenario of besla et al .",
    "only future astrometric missions reaching @xmath232arcsec accuracy can help clarify these issues .",
    "in section [ sec : disr ] , we estimated the characteristic disruption time - scale @xmath5 of a @xmath150 cluster in the lmc .",
    "we concluded that the best constraint we could obtain is a _ range _ of estimates , i.e. @xmath8gyr .",
    "in other words , despite the proximity of the lmc to the milky way , its cluster disruption time - scale can not be constrained to better than an order of magnitude .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate which strategy we may adopt in the future to tighten the constraint to the cluster disruption time - scale and , therefore , the cluster formation history in the lmc .",
    "specifically , we generate sets of ( @xmath60 ) data , which we subsequently `` observe '' following the same procedure as before .",
    "we can then compare the retrieved ( range of ) cluster disruption time - scale estimates with the disruption rate actually used to generate these synthetic cluster populations .",
    "six distinct cases will be discussed .",
    "we consider two cluster disruption time - scales ( @xmath198 and 9.9 ) , combined with three distinct observational situations , in terms of cluster number and detection limit .",
    "first , we assume a detection limit and a number of observed clusters similar to that in section [ sec : disr ] ( i.e. , @xmath233 clusters brighter than @xmath234 mag and spanning the age range [ 50myr,1.5gyr ] ; labelled `` @xmath186 , @xmath235 '' in figs .",
    "[ fig : simul_oad ] and [ fig : sim_xhi2 ] ) .",
    "secondly , we retain the same detection limit but consider twice as many clusters ( i.e. , @xmath236 clusters brighter than @xmath186 mag , for @xmath237 ; labelled `` @xmath186 , @xmath238 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] ) .",
    "and thirdly , we consider the same number of clusters brighter than @xmath186 mag , but a detection limit improved by 1.2mag , at @xmath239 ( the fading limit of h03 represented by the dash - dotted line [3] in fig .  [ fig : obs_am ] ; labelled `` @xmath240 , @xmath235 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the total number of clusters is significantly larger because of the inclusion of objects with @xmath241 mag .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we have assumed a constant cfr for @xmath242 and the `` canonical '' @xmath13 icmf . after generating ages and masses for the required number of clusters , we added gaussian noise to our synthetic data set .",
    "we adopt @xmath243 dex as the standard deviation of logarithmic cluster ages and masses .",
    "this represents a fair upper limit to the internal errors for the de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) sample , since @xmath244 per cent of their clusters exhibit smaller errors .",
    "we then extracted clusters in the appropriate age range and above the appropriate detection limit . finally , their age distribution integrated over mass , mass distribution integrated over age , and the two - dimensional ( @xmath66 ) distribution were analysed in exactly the same way as we did for the observed lmc cluster sample ( section [ sec : disr ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : simul_oad ] illustrates the simulated observed age distribution ( large open circles ) obtained with @xmath233 surviving clusters brighter than the fiducial detection limit at @xmath245 in case of @xmath198",
    ". the upper four lines are the derived cfrs , either constant ( open symbols ) or adjusted to match the model and observed age distributions ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the lower lines , using the same line style coding , are the model age distributions of the detected survivors .",
    "model solutions are shown for two disruption time - scales , @xmath198 ( circle - symbol lines ) and 9.9 ( square - symbol lines ) .",
    "the observed age distribution is well - matched for a constant cfr combined with a cluster disruption time - scale of @xmath197 , since these are the actual characteristics of the simulated observations . on the other hand , the model based on a constant cfr and @xmath85 results in an age distribution ( dash - dotted line with open squares ) that is shallower than the `` observations '' .",
    "therefore , on average , the corresponding _ adjusted _ cfr declines towards older age ( dash - dotted line with filled squares ) .",
    "the input constant cfr used to generate the `` observations '' is shown as the horizontal thick dashed line ( i.e. , 20 clusters myr@xmath9 ) .",
    "one can immediately see that , if the cluster disruption time - scale is correctly estimated , the cfr can be derived with great accuracy ( i.e. , the thick dashed line and the solid line with circles follow each other closely ) , except for some sampling noise .",
    "if the cluster disruption time - scale is incorrectly assumed to be 8 times longer ( @xmath200 ) , then the cfr is underestimated ( as a result of the assumed slow cluster disruption ) , although by an average factor of two at most .",
    "we now investigate what the conditions are that we need to derive a better approximation to the lmc cluster formation history than what we found in section [ sec : disr ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] we plot the evolution of the ( @xmath246 , @xmath137 ) functions which follow from the analysis of the simulated data . in the left and right - hand panels",

    "does the ( @xmath5 , @xmath137 ) function show a clear minimum .",
    "for instance , let us consider the third panel from the top in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] ( i.e. , the @xmath248_{\\rm mf}$ ] obtained for an adjusted cfr  ` var cfr ' ) .",
    "it shows that @xmath248_{\\rm mf , min } \\simeq 1 $ ] at @xmath249 and @xmath248_{\\rm mf } < [ \\chi^2_{\\nu}]_{\\rm mf , min}+1 $ ] for @xmath250 .",
    "we therefore recover the correct cluster disruption time - scale ( @xmath251 ) , but the range of acceptable estimates covers a decade in @xmath5 . even if the detection limit remains the same , that situation is improved if the number of clusters in the sample is increased . with twice as many clusters , one now obtains @xmath248_{\\rm mf , min } \\simeq 1 $ ] at @xmath252 and @xmath248_{\\rm mf } < [ \\chi^2_{\\nu}]_{\\rm mf , min}+1 $ ] for @xmath253 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath254 are now reduced by a factor of about two , as a direct result of the smaller poissonian noise in the cluster age and mass distributions . in other words ,",
    "the more populous a star cluster system is , the better its inferred cluster formation history .",
    "the best accuracy for the @xmath5 estimate is achieved when the detection limit gets fainter by 1.2mag ( dashed curve ) . in that case",
    ", @xmath248_{\\rm mf , min } \\simeq 1.4 $ ] at @xmath255 and @xmath248_{\\rm mf } < [ \\chi^2_{\\nu}]_{\\rm mf , min}+1 $ ] for @xmath256 . if we compare this with the right - hand equivalent panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] , for which @xmath257 , we find @xmath248_{\\rm mf , min } \\simeq 0.3 $ ] for @xmath258 and @xmath248_{\\rm mf } < [ \\chi^2_{\\nu}]_{\\rm mf , min}+1 $ ] for @xmath259 .",
    "we therefore conclude that if the star cluster system of the lmc were observed with a 90 per cent completeness limit of @xmath260 mag , we could decide more easily whether the cluster disruption time - scale is of order 1 or 10gyr , which we can not do with the data presently available to us .",
    "the reason why a detection limit improved by @xmath261 better distinguishes @xmath262 from 9.9 is directly related to whether or not the turn - over expected to appear in the cmf as a result of dynamical secular evolution shows up above the detection limit . to illustrate this , we carried out additional simulations , the results of which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevol_msp ] .",
    "each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tevol_msp ] corresponds to a synthetic star cluster population formed with a constant cfr for the given age range , and with the `` canonical '' ( @xmath0 ) power - law icmf . here",
    ", we are interested in the location of the cmf turn - over with respect to the detection limit , independently of the presence of observational errors and of size - of - sample related poissonian noise . to limit this , we adopt a fairly large initial number of clusters ( @xmath194 ) for each limited age range ( i.e. , for each panel ) .",
    "the cluster disruption time - scale is @xmath198 and 9.9 in the left and right - hand panels , respectively .",
    "the dashed line represents the icmf and the solid line is for the evolved cmf for the age ranges considered , i.e. , from top to bottom : @xmath263 , @xmath152 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 .",
    "also shown are the detection limits corresponding to @xmath2 mag ( vertical thick solid line ) and to @xmath266 mag ( vertical thick dotted line ) , which we discussed above .    at young ages ( @xmath267 ) , the evolved cmf remains a good proxy to the icmf .",
    "as clusters age , the power - law icmf is secularly turned into a gaussian cmf . the older the cluster system and/or the shorter @xmath268 , the higher the resulting cluster mass at the turn - over .",
    "let us consider the left - hand panels , for which @xmath198 .",
    "at an age of 1gyr , the turn - over remains at the lower edge of the fiducial detection limit of @xmath2 mag . as a result ,",
    "the imprint of dynamical evolution is barely detectable and @xmath246 can not be determined from the turn - over location .",
    "all we can retrieve is a lower limit to @xmath5 , in the sense that we can exclude all disruption time - scales which are short enough to bring the cmf turn - over beyond the detection limit . with the improved detection limit of @xmath269 mag ( vertical dotted line ) ,",
    "the cluster mass at the turn - over is ( just ) measurable , hence the clear minimum seen in the @xmath248_{\\rm mf}$ ] of the third panel on the left - hand side in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "if @xmath270 , however , the cmf evolves on such a slow time - scale that the turn - over remains undetected , regardless of whether @xmath269 or @xmath271 mag .",
    "only a lower limit to @xmath98 can be inferred and the @xmath137 functions are steadily decreasing with increasing @xmath5 ( right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xhi2 ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that deriving a @xmath5 estimate rather than a lower limit is better achievable based on a more evolved cluster population , if either the cluster disruption time - scale is shorter or if the population contains older clusters . as for the latter ,",
    "this is so because disruption limits in ( @xmath60 ) space ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_am ] ) are steeper than detection limits ( dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_am ] ) . yet , in that case , the small number of survivors at old age , where the turn - over location is firmly set , may hamper any analysis as a result of significant poissonian noise ( see , e.g. , the fourth panel on the left - hand side in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevol_msp ] ) .",
    "our lmc star cluster sample lacks clusters at intermediate and old age , as it contains only @xmath211 20 star clusters older than 1gyr above the fiducial detection limit .",
    "combined with the bright fiducial detection limit we defined in section [ sec : synth ] , this data paucity results in only a lower limit to the characteristic lmc star cluster disruption time - scale of @xmath272gyr .",
    "in this paper , we have carried out numerous detailed monte - carlo simulations aimed at constraining the cluster formation history and the rate of bound cluster disruption in the lmc star cluster system .",
    "we considered only clusters older than 50myr in order not to determine erroneously short cluster disruption time - scale as a result of the inclusion of the infant mortality and infant weight loss evolutionary phases .",
    "our data are based on the @xmath29 photometry of h03 ( obtained from massey s ( 2002 ) survey of the magellanic clouds ) , for which de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) obtained homogeneously determined age and mass estimates .",
    "we estimated a fiducial detection limit above which the cluster sample is ( fairly ) complete from the cmf as a function of age , at @xmath273 .",
    "this is significantly brighter than h03 s fading limit .",
    "we consider only clusters brighter than this limit , in order to avoid severe statistical incompleteness effects .    we have evolved synthetic star cluster systems characterised by constant cfrs assuming 20 different cluster disruption time - scales .",
    "the cfr was adjusted to reproduce the observed age distribution . by doing so ,",
    "we are likely to loose sensitivity to cfr variations occurring on a time - scale shorter than the width of the age range corresponding to each logarithmic age bin ( i.e. , more likely at old age where our age bins span greater linear age ranges than at young age ) . however , the general behaviour of the cfr , as well as the cfr averaged over age are robustly recovered ( see section [ sec:1vs10 ] ) .",
    "we then compare , in a `` poissonian '' @xmath1 sense the modelled mass distribution and the modelled [ @xmath60 ] distribution to the observations .",
    "we show that because of the bright detection limit at @xmath275 mag , one can not constrain @xmath5 to better than a lower limit , @xmath8gyr .",
    "the tightest constraints are set by the cmf integrated over age .",
    "the @xmath1 test applied to the distribution of points in [ @xmath132 ] space turns out to be a poor diagnostic tool .",
    "this is probably related to the low density of points in each cell of the [ @xmath66 ] , compared to the density of points in each bin of the integrated cmf , leading to smaller poissonnian error bars and therefore a better constrained model in the latter case .",
    "our range of cluster disruption time - scale estimates is robust with respect to model variations , such as of the upper limit of the initial cluster mass range , the location of the grid in [ @xmath60 ] , and the size of cells in this grid .",
    "we have shown that should the detection limit be underestimated , artificially shortened cluster disruption time - scales would result .",
    "this is so because there is a degeneracy between incompleteness and secular evolution , i.e. , the fading - driven turn - over in a cmf in a given age bin is interpreted as resulting from secular evolution , leading to a shortened cluster disruption time - scale .    having set the best possible constraints on @xmath5 , we explored the corresponding cfr , in particular considering @xmath278 and 10 gyr .",
    "the cfr has been increasing steadily from about 0.3 clusters myr@xmath9 5 gyr ago , to a present rate of @xmath10 clusters myr@xmath9 , for clusters spanning an initial mass range of @xmath11 m@xmath4 .",
    "the cfrs inferred for both disruption time - scales differ by at most a factor of three ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ad_all ] ) . at older ages",
    "however , the situation becomes unclear .",
    "the uncertainty in the cfr as a result of the uncertainty on @xmath5 increases .",
    "in addition , the overall temporal behaviour of the cfr depends on the shape of the icmf of the oldest , globular cluster - like objects .",
    "if this is the universal gaussian icmf , then the cfr has increased steadily over a hubble time from @xmath12 cluster gyr@xmath9 15 gyr ago to its present value . on the contrary ,",
    "if the icmf has always been a power law with a slope close to @xmath13 , the cfr exhibits a minimum some 5 gyr ago .",
    "our results may be related to the orbital history and dynamics of the lmc with respect to both the smc and the milky way , although this remains poorly constrained because of a lack of proper motion measurements with the required accuracy ( besla et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "additionally , we note that interactions between the clouds and between the clouds and the galaxy , while affecting their star - formation history , also affect the _ structure _ of the magellanic clouds ( bekki & chiba 2005 ) .",
    "this may have induced temporal variations in the cluster disruption time - scale over the past hubble time , rendering the cluster disruption time - scale estimate at old age even more uncertain .",
    "finally , we have investigated which strategy should be adopted in the future in order to better constrain the cluster disruption time - scale in the lmc .",
    "specifically , we have generated synthetic cluster populations defined by a given cluster formation history , icmf and various dissolution rates .",
    "after the addition of gaussian noise to mimic an observational situation , we processed these simulated data sets in the same way as the actual lmc data . we demonstrate that _ if _ the cluster disruption time - scale is known , then the cfr can be derived accurately .",
    "we confirm our inability to distinguish @xmath279 gyr from 10 gyr because of the bright detection limit .",
    "with such a bright detection limit , the expected turn - over in the cmf caused by dynamical evolution is not detected , for any cluster age range . as a result , only a lower limit to the cluster disruption time - scale can be retrieved , i.e. , we can exclude all @xmath5 that are short enough to lead to a turn - over above the detection limit . to obtain age and mass estimates for an lmc star cluster sample complete above @xmath240",
    "is desirable to more easily distinguish between @xmath279 gyr and @xmath280 gyr .",
