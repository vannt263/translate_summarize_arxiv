    "in 1938 baer @xcite investigated the conditions for a group to be the inner automorphism group of another group .",
    "hall and senior @xcite called such groups _",
    "capable_. p. hall in his landmark paper @xcite , noted that characterization of capable groups is important in classifying groups of prime power order .",
    "baer @xcite succeeded to determine all capable groups among the direct sums of cyclic groups , and hence finitely generated abelian groups . the third author in his joint paper in 1997 @xcite , generalized the notion of capability to any variety of groups which was called @xmath0-capability .",
    "the aim of this work is determining all finitely generated abelian groups which are varietal capable with respect to the variety of polynilpotent groups of class row @xmath1 , that is @xmath2 .",
    "this result is a vast generalization of baer s work in the case of finitely generated abelian groups .",
    "we shall assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of variety of groups and the verbal and the marginal subgroups .",
    "the notion of baer invariant is also considered to be known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following definition is of several usage in this article .",
    "let @xmath0 be any variety of groups defined by a set of laws @xmath3 , and @xmath4 be any group .",
    "@xmath4 is called @xmath0-capable if there exists a group @xmath5 which satisfies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the marginal subgroup of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that although two different sets of words can generate a variety but the marginal subgroups with respect to these sets of words coincide , so the terminology @xmath0-capability has no ambiguity . according to the above definition capable groups",
    "are @xmath8-capable , where @xmath8 is the variety of abelian groups .",
    "the following definition and theorem are found in @xcite and contains a necessary and sufficient condition for a group to be @xmath0-capable .",
    "let @xmath0 be any variety and @xmath4 be any group .",
    "then @xmath9 is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath10    with the above notations and assumptions @xmath11 is the largest quotient of @xmath4 which is @xmath12-capable , and hence @xmath4 is @xmath0-capable if and only if @xmath13 .    the following theorem and its consequences state relationship between @xmath0-capability and baer invariants .    ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be any variety of groups , @xmath4 be any group , and @xmath14 be a normal subgroup of @xmath4 contained in the marginal subgroup @xmath15 .",
    "then the natural homomorphism @xmath16 is injective if and only if @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the baer invariant of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath0 .    in finite case",
    "the following corollary is useful to be applied .",

    "assume that @xmath18 and @xmath20 are finite groups for a normal subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath4 , then the natural homomorphism @xmath16 is injective if and only if @xmath21 .",
    "the following result is a consequence of theorem 2.4 .",
    "an abelian group @xmath4 is @xmath22-capable if and only if the natural homomorphism @xmath23 has a non - trivial kernel for all non - identity elements @xmath24 in @xmath4 .    in order to use theorem 2.4",
    "we need the explicit structure of the baer invariants of finitely generated abelian groups with respect to the variety of polynilpotent groups .",
    "the following give us the structure .",
    "( @xcite ) .",

    "first of all we state two theorems of baer , burns and ellis , which determine all @xmath37-capable finitely generated abelian groups , in which @xmath37 is the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most @xmath38 .",
    "the case @xmath39 is permissible and refers to capability .",
    "+ the following theorem is not just what baer proved , but a conclusion of it as a special case .",
    "( r. baer @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath26 be a finitely generated abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28",
    ". then @xmath4 is capable precisely when + @xmath40 @xmath41 ; or + @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "( j. burns and g. ellis @xcite ) .",
    "a finitely generated abelian group is @xmath46-capable if and only if it is capable .",
    "according to the above theorem , the condition for a finitely generated abelian group to be @xmath37-capable is just the condition for capability of it .",
    "it is of interest to know which varieties behave like as nilpotent varieties in case of capability of finitely generated abelian groups . answering this question in general case",
    "need much more information , but in case of some outer commutator varieties , more precisely polynilpotent varieties , we intend to answer it . in the rest",
    "we see that not all polynilpotent varieties behave like as nilpotent varieties in case of capability , but a large class of them do . to show varieties which not behave so we give the following example .",
    "let @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "one may easily show that @xmath4 and all its quotients are at most two - generator abelian groups , so by theorem 2.7 @xmath49 for any normal subgroup of @xmath4 , @xmath14 say , in which @xmath50 is the variety of metabelian groups .",
    "now theorem 2.4 implies @xmath4 is not @xmath50-capable .",
    "now the main goal of this article is presented , which is classifying all @xmath2-capable groups in the class of finitely generated abelian groups . according to theorem 2.7",
    "if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then @xmath53 whenever @xmath4 has at most two generators , but if  @xmath54   or   @xmath55  , then @xmath53 only when @xmath4 is cyclic . hence we need to separate these two cases , and the rest of work shows the results are different .",
    "we only state the proof in the case @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the proof of the other case is similar .",
    "just for the sake of clarity we separate the procedure in two cases ; finite and infinite .",
    "case one : finite case .",
    "+ throughout the following two lemmas we assume that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    let @xmath56 be a finite abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath4 is @xmath2-capable then @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "by contrary assume we have @xmath59 or not @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 then similar to example 3.1 @xmath4 and all its quotients are at most two - generator abelian groups so by theorem 2.7 @xmath60 for any normal subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath4 , so by theorem 2.4 @xmath4 is not @xmath2-capable . on the other hand",
    "if , for example , @xmath61 , we introduce a normal subgroup of @xmath4 , @xmath14 say ; for which the natural homomorphism @xmath62 is injective .",
    "put @xmath14 the subgroup generated by @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "now theorem 2.7 shows that @xmath66 , hence by corollary 2.5 we have the injectivity of @xmath67 .",
    "so the result holds by theorem 2.4 . the second case for which we have",
    "@xmath68 has a similar proof by putting @xmath69 .",
    "the above lemma presents a necessary condition for a finite abelian group to be @xmath2-capable .",
    "the following shows it is sufficient .",
    "let @xmath56 be a finite abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28 in which @xmath70 and @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath4 is @xmath2-capable .    by theorem 2.4",
    "it is enough to show that for an arbitrary normal subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath4 , @xmath71 is not injective . in finite abelian groups",
    "each quotient is isomorphic to a subgroup and vice versa .",
    "now let @xmath14 be an arbitrary normal subgroup of @xmath4 , then @xmath72 is isomorphic to a subgroup of @xmath4 , @xmath73 say ; so by theorem 2.8 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 for all @xmath28 and @xmath35 for all @xmath74 .",
    "computing @xmath75 and @xmath76 using theorem 2.7 , shows that @xmath77 if and only if @xmath78 for all @xmath79 , but @xmath58 by hypothesis which implies @xmath80 and @xmath81 which is equivalent to @xmath82 or @xmath83 . now by theorem 2.4 @xmath4 is @xmath2-capable .",
    "case two : infinite case .",
    "+ similar to the previous case , through the following two lemmas we assume that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath84 be an infinite finitely generated abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath4 is @xmath2-capable then @xmath85 .",
    "we show that if @xmath86 , then there exists a normal subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath4 for which the natural homomorphism @xmath62 is injective and hence the result follows by theorem 2.4 .",
    "suppose @xmath87 , then @xmath88 .",
    "put @xmath14 to be the subgroup generated by @xmath89 so @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "now by theorem 2.7 we have @xmath66 .",
    "using theorems 2.4 and corollary 2.5 the result will follow . if @xmath92 then put @xmath93 and use a similar proof .",
    "the reverse of the above lemma can be presented as follows .",
    "let @xmath84 be an infinite finitely generated abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28 . if @xmath85 then @xmath4 is @xmath2-capable .",
    "similar to lemma 3.4 it is enough to show that there is no normal subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath4 for which @xmath71 is injective .",
    "consider two cases @xmath40 @xmath14 is infinite ; and @xmath42 @xmath14 is finite .    in case @xmath40",
    "trivially @xmath94 , now by theorem 2.7 @xmath95 .",
    "so there is no injection between @xmath75 and@xmath96 . in case",
    "@xmath42 @xmath97 and hence @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath35 for all @xmath28 , now by theorem 2.7 we have @xmath100 and @xmath101 . now by contrary assume that the natural homomorphism @xmath62 which will be called @xmath102 through the proof , is injective .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "also we have @xmath105 .",
    "as @xmath102 is injective we must have @xmath78 for all @xmath36 so @xmath106 but @xmath107 and hence @xmath83 which completes the proof .",
    "the latest lemmas classify all finitely generated abelian groups which are @xmath2-capable , provided that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "of the most famous examples of these varieties are @xmath108 s , the varieties of soluble groups of length at most @xmath109 .    the case @xmath55 or",
    "@xmath54 has different results but similar proof , so the proof are shortened .",
    "examples of these varieties are @xmath37 s and @xmath8 , which are the varieties of nilpotent groups of class at most @xmath38 and abelian groups , respectively , for the case @xmath54 , and polynilpotent varieties which are not solvable for the case @xmath55 .",
    "the following theorems are stated with the conditions @xmath55 or @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath56 be a finite abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28",
    ". then @xmath4 is @xmath2-capable if and only if @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the proof is completely similar to the proofs of lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 .",
    "the only matter which may be considered is the fact that for an arbitrary finite abelian group @xmath56 we have @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath84 be an infinite finitely generated abelian group , where @xmath27 for all @xmath28 is @xmath25-capable if and only if @xmath41 .",
    "the proof is similar to lemmas 3.5 and 3.6 .",
    "the only fact may be considered is the structure of the polynilpotent multipliers of @xmath4 and @xmath72 in the case @xmath55 or @xmath54 .",
    "more exactly the difference is the fact that we have @xmath111 , so the torsion free rank of @xmath75 is zero exactly when @xmath4 has the torsion free rank 1 .",
