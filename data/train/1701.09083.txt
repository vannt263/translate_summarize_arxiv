    "rank aggregation is a family of problems concerned with fusing disparate ranking information , and it arises in application areas as diverse as social choice , meta - search , natural language processing , bioinformatics , and information retrieval  @xcite .",
    "the observed rankings are either linear orders ( permutations ) or partial ( element - tied ) rankings .",
    "sometimes , rankings are assumed to be of the form of a set of pairwise comparisons  @xcite .",
    "note that , many massive ordinal datasets arise from _ ratings _ , rather than actual comparisons . rank aggregation , rather than averaging of ratings , is justified due to the fact that most raters have different rating `` scales '' . as an example",
    ", the rating three of one user may indicate that the user liked the item , while the rating three by another user may indicate that the user disliked the item .",
    "hence , actual preferences can only be deduced using ranked ratings .    in rank aggregation ,",
    "the task at hand is to find a ranking that is at the smallest cumulative distance from a given set of rankings . here",
    ", the cumulative distance from a set equals the sum of the distances from each element of the set , and the most frequently used distance measure for the case of permutations is the kendall @xmath0 distance . for the case of partial rankings ,",
    "the distance of choice is the kemeny distance  @xcite .",
    "the kendall @xmath0 distance between two permutations equals the smallest number of adjacent transpositions needed to convert one permutation into the other .",
    "the kemeny distance contains an additional weighted correction term that accounts for ties in the rankings .",
    "it is well known that for a wide range of distance functions , learning the underlying models and aggregating rankings is computationally hard  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the case when the distance measure is the kendall @xmath0 distance , a number of approximation algorithms have been developed that offer various trade - offs between quality of aggregation and computational complexity  @xcite .",
    "the techniques used for aggregating permutations in a given set include randomly choosing a permutation from the set ( pick - a - perm ) , pivoting via random selections of elements and divide - and - conquer approaches ( fas - pivot ) , markov chain methods akin to pagerank , and minimum weight graph matching methods exploiting the fact that the kendall @xmath0 distance is well - approximated by the spearman footrule distance ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "methods with provable performance guarantees  pick - a - perm , fas - pivot , and sm  give a @xmath1-approximation for the objective function , although combinations thereof are known to improve the constant to @xmath2 or @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "there also exists a polynomial time approximation scheme ( ptas ) for the aggregation problem  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , most of these known approximate rank aggregation algorithms have high complexity for use with massive datasets and may not be implemented in a parallel fashion .",
    "furthermore , they do not easily extend to partial rankings .",
    "in many cases , a performance analysis on probabilistic models  @xcite such as the plackett - luce model  @xcite or the mallows model  @xcite , is intractable .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach to the problem of rank aggregation that uses a combinatorial transform , the lehmer code ( lc ) .",
    "the gist of the approach is to convert permutations into their lehmer code representations , in which each coordinate takes values independently from other coordinates .",
    "aggregation over the lehmer code domain reduces to computing the median or mode of a bounded set of numbers , which can be done in linear time .",
    "furthermore , efficient conversion algorithms between permutations and lehmer codes  also running in linear time  are known , making the overall complexity of the parallel implementation of the scheme @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the number of permutations to be aggregated , and @xmath6 denotes the length ( size ) of the permutations . to illustrate the performance of the lehmer code aggregators ( lcas ) on permutations , we carry out simulation studies showing that the algorithms perform comparably with the best known methods for approximate aggregation , but at a significantly lower computational cost .",
    "we then proceed to establish a number of theoretical performance guarantees for the lca algorithms : in particular , we consider the mallows model with the kendall @xmath0 distance for permutations and kemeny distance for partial rankings where ties are allowed . we show that the centroid permutation of the model or a derivative thereof may be recovered from @xmath7 samples from the corresponding distribution with high probability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] contains the mathematical preliminaries and the definitions used throughout the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : algorithms ] introduces our new aggregation methods for two types of rankings , while section  [ sec : analysis ] describes our analysis pertaining to the mallows and generalized mallows models .",
    "section  [ sec : simulations ] contains illustrative simulation results comparing the performance of the lc aggregators to that of other known aggregation methods , both on simulated and real ranking data .",
    "a number of technical results , namely detailed proofs of theorems and lemmas , can be found in the appendix .",
    "let @xmath8 denote a set of @xmath6 elements , which without loss of generality we assume to be equal to @xmath9\\equiv\\{{1,2,\\ldots , n\\}}$ ] .",
    "a ranking is an ordering of a subset of elements @xmath10 of @xmath9 $ ] according to a predefined rule .",
    "when @xmath11 $ ] , we refer to the order as a permutation ( full ranking ) .",
    "when a ranking includes ties , we refer to it as a partial ranking ( weak or bucket order ) .",
    "partial rankings may be used to complete rankings of subsets of element in @xmath9 $ ] in a number of different ways  @xcite , one being to tie all unranked elements at the last position .",
    "rigorously , a permutation is a bijection @xmath12 \\rightarrow [ n]$ ] , and the set of permutations over @xmath9 $ ] forms the symmetric group of order @xmath13 denoted by @xmath14 . for any @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ]",
    ", @xmath17 denotes the rank ( position ) of the element @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "we say that @xmath18 is ranked higher than @xmath20 ( ranked lower than @xmath20 ) iff @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the inverse of a permutation @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath23\\rightarrow [ n]$ ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath24 represents the element ranked at position @xmath25 in @xmath19 .",
    "we define _ the projection of a permutation _ @xmath19 over a subset of elements @xmath26 $ ] , denoted by @xmath27 $ ] , as an ordering of elements in @xmath10 such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 iff @xmath22 . as an example",
    ", the projection of @xmath30 over @xmath31 equals @xmath32 since @xmath33 .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath34 equals the rank of element @xmath35 in @xmath19 .",
    "we use a similar set of definitions for partial rankings  @xcite .",
    "a partial ranking @xmath19 is also defined as a mapping @xmath9\\rightarrow [ n]$ ] .",
    "in contrast to permutations , where the mapping is a bijection , the mapping in partial ranking allows for ties , i.e. , there may exist two elements @xmath36 such that @xmath37 . a partial ranking",
    "is often represented using buckets , and is in this context referred to as a _ bucket order _  @xcite . in a bucket order ,",
    "the elements of the set @xmath9 $ ] are partitioned into a number of subsets , or buckets , @xmath38 .",
    "we let @xmath17 denote the index of the bucket containing the element @xmath18 in @xmath19 , so the element @xmath18 is assigned to bucket @xmath39 .",
    "two elements @xmath40 lie in the same bucket if and only if they are tied in @xmath19 .",
    "we may also define a projection of a partial ranking @xmath19 over a subset of elements @xmath41 $ ] , denoted by @xmath42 , so that for @xmath28 , @xmath29 iff @xmath22 and @xmath43 iff @xmath37 . for a given partial ranking @xmath19",
    ", we use @xmath44 to denote its corresponding buckets .",
    "in addition , we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 . based on the previous discussion , @xmath47 ( the number of elements that are in the bucket containing @xmath18 ) . when referring to the bucket for a certain element @xmath18 , we use @xmath48 whenever no confusion arises . note that if we arbitrarily break ties in @xmath19 to create a permutation @xmath49 , then @xmath50 ; clearly , if @xmath19 is a permutation , we have @xmath51 .",
    "a number of distance functions between permutations are known from the social choice , learning and discrete mathematics literature  @xcite .",
    "one distance function of interest is based on transpositions : a transposition @xmath52 is a swap of elements at positions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 . if @xmath56 , the transposition is referred to as an adjacent transposition .",
    "it is well known that transpositions ( adjacent transpositions ) generate @xmath57 , i.e. , any permutation @xmath58 can be converted into another permutation @xmath59 through a sequence of transpositions ( adjacent transpositions )  @xcite .",
    "the smallest number of adjacent transpositions needed to convert a permutation @xmath60 into another permutation @xmath19 is known as the kendall @xmath0 distance between @xmath60 and @xmath19 , and is denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "alternatively , the kendall @xmath0 distance between two permutations @xmath60 and @xmath19 over @xmath9 $ ] equals the number of mutual inversions between the elements of the two permutations : @xmath62 another distance measure , that does not rely on transpositions , is the spearman footrule , defined as @xmath63 } |\\sigma(x ) -\\pi(x)|.\\ ] ] a well known result by diaconis and graham  @xcite asserts that @xmath64 .",
    "one may also define an extension of the kendall @xmath0 distance for the case of two partial rankings @xmath60 and @xmath19 over the set @xmath9 $ ] , known as the kemeny distance : @xmath65 the kemeny distance includes a component equal to the kendal @xmath0 distance between the linear chains in the partial rankings , and another , scaled component that characterizes the distance of tied pairs of elements  @xcite .",
    "the spearman footrule distance may also be defined to apply to partial rankings  @xcite , and it equals the sum of the absolute differences between `` positions '' of elements in the partial rankings . here , the position of an element @xmath18 in a partial ranking @xmath19 is defined as @xmath66 the above defined spearman distance is a @xmath1-approximation for the kemeny distance between two partial rankings  @xcite .",
