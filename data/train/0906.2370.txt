    "the two - orbital hubbard model has recently come into limelight as a minimal model capable of describing the phenomenon of orbital selective mott transition experimentally observed in certain materials @xcite .",
    "this was demonstrated @xcite through a simple two - pole approximation within the framework of the composite operator method @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we report a preliminary aimed at improving the two - pole approximation by using a new basis , the one that solves the system when reduced to a single atom .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the two - orbital hubbard model in the limit of vanishing kinetic energy ( i.e. , reduced to a single atom ) read as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electronic creation operator in spinorial notation in the orbital @xmath6 @xmath7 is the double occupancy operator in the orbital @xmath6 @xmath8 is the ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) charge and ( @xmath11 ) spin density operator in the orbital @xmath6 @xmath1 is the interorbital hybridization , @xmath12 is the chemical potential , @xmath13 is the intraorbital coulomb repulsion , @xmath14 is the interorbital coulomb repulsion , @xmath2 is the exchange interorbital interaction .",
    "hereafter , we will use @xmath13 as the unit of energy and we will fix , as usual , @xmath15",
    "at zero temperature and half filling ( @xmath16 ) , by studying the exact solution in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath17 it is possible to show that the system undergoes a phase transition between a singlet ( diner ) state @xmath18 $ ] and a triplet one @xmath19 $ ] at a critical value of the interorbital hybridization : @xmath20    the eigenvaues and eigenvectors in the half - filling sector read as @xmath21,\\\\    |3\\rangle & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(b^2 + 1)}}[b(|\\uparrow;\\downarrow\\rangle-|\\downarrow;\\uparrow\\rangle)+    |\\uparrow\\downarrow;0\\rangle-|0;\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle],\\\\    |4\\rangle & = |\\uparrow;\\uparrow\\rangle,\\\\    |5\\rangle & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow;\\downarrow\\rangle+|\\downarrow;\\uparrow\\rangle),\\\\    |6\\rangle & = |\\downarrow;\\downarrow\\rangle,\\\\    e_1 & = -2\\mu+2v+u - j,\\\\    e_2&=-2\\mu+2v+\\frac{1}{2}(u+u')+j-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(u - u')^2 + 16v^2},\\\\    e_3&=-2\\mu+2v+\\frac{1}{2}(u+u')+j+\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(u - u')^2 + 16v^2},\\\\    e_4&=-2\\mu+2v+u'-j,\\\\    e_5&=e_4,\\\\    e_6&=e_4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 in this system , it is also possible to study both the particle entropy @xcite and the mode entropy @xcite .",
    "the particle entropy @xmath23 requires the calculation of the concurrence @xmath24 : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for the square roots of the eigenvalues , taken in descending order of magnitude , of the matrix @xmath28 @xmath29 is the density matrix of the system ( @xmath30 is the inverse temperature ) and @xmath31 is the dualization operator obtained by composing the particle - hole transformation @xmath32 with the conjugation operator @xmath33 the mode entropy @xmath34 on the other hand , requires calculation of the reduced density matrix @xmath35 with respect to a chosen orbital @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 stands for a complete basis set for the orbital @xmath40 then , we simply have @xmath41     and @xmath42 as functions of the interorbital hybridization @xmath1 and of the exchange interorbital interaction @xmath43,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig .",
    "1 , the particle entropy ( left part ) and the mode entropy ( right part ) are reported at @xmath44 as functions of the interorbital hybridization @xmath1 and of the exchange interorbital interaction @xmath43 both types of entropy show a well defined jump exactly on the line @xmath45 where the phase transition occurs .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that the mode entropy , in contrast to the the particle entropy , is not capable of discriminating between a _ genuine _ entanglement between substantially different elementary states ( a dimer @xmath46 and a singlet @xmath47 ) and the _ trivial _ entanglement between states arising from symmetry requirements ( the three sates of a triplet @xmath48 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the particle entropy is the only measure correctly accounting for an absolute lack of entanglement in the latter case .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that both entanglement measures known in the literature ( particle entropy and mode entropy ) are capable of capturing the essential physics of the atomic two - orbital hubbard model .",
    "in particular , their jumps can be used for determining the location , in the phase diagram , of the transition line separating the singlet ( dimer ) state and the triplet .    00 v.  i. anisimov , i.  a. nekrasov , d.  e. kondakov , t.  m. rice , and m. sigist , eur .",
