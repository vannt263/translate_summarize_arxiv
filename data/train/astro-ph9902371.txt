    "these absorption lines sample environments in which the chemical and ionization conditions have presumably been influenced by the central engine of the quasar active nucleus ( see arav , shlosman , & weymann 1997 ) .",
    "bal gas is thought to be material within @xmath10 kpc of the quasar that is undergoing a high velocity outflow , typically @xmath11 to @xmath12   ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "though there are many interpretations of these trends , a unified picture has been proposed in which all quasars have bal flows and that various viewing angles through the outflowing material result in different observed absorption properties .",
    "most unified pictures , as suggested by polarization studies ( e.g.@xcite ) , have the bal material _ originating _ from a disk geometry ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an apparently rare class of so  called `` mini  bal '' quasars have been identified ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these quasars often exhibit flat  bottomed ( but not necessarily black bottomed ) absorption profiles with overall velocity spreads less than 2000  .",
    "the relationship between mini  bal and bal quasars is not yet understood . from the point of view of ultraviolet rest ",
    "frame ( uv ) spectra , mini  bal quasars may prove to be the most useful for deducing the chemical and ionization conditions of material involved in bal flows ( @xcite ) , since they do not suffer the extreme blending seen in bal quasars .",
    "ultimately , however , any working model of bal flows will need to survive observational probings not only with uv rest ",
    "frame data , but with radio and both soft and hard x  ray data as well .",
    "in addition to multi  band observations , studies are needed that extend the sample of bal and mini  bal quasars to the highest redshifts .",

    "extending bal quasar studies to @xmath16 would yield a chronological baseline on par with studies of the absorbers for firmly establishing cosmic evolution ( or lack of ) in a class of astronomical object .",

    "this small @xmath60 implies either that the emission line is intrinsically very narrow or suffers absorption along both wings ( to the blue and high velocity , asymmetric , to the red ) that conspire to leave its peak relatively unshifted .    for the highest redshift quasars ,",

    "the dominant source of error in the measurement of the flux decrement is the uncertainty in the power  law continuum fit . to estimate the uncertainty in our measurement , we used the @xmath56 spread in @xmath48 and in @xmath44 that conspire to give the extreme upper and lower values of @xmath70 . for pc  1415 + 3408",

    "since black saturation is virtually never seen in bal quasars , this suggests that we are either seeing pc  1415 + 3408 at a low probability viewing angle , or that the bal flow geometry around this quasar is not common to bal quasars . for bals originating from an equatorial flow ( e.g.  @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , two low  probability viewing angles include one _ directly _ edge on to the disk or one grazing the bal flow material right at the opening angle . however , a line of sight grazing the opening angle might be more likely to have residual flux in the absorption trough due to partial coverage of the compact continuum source or due to light scattered back into the line of sight or to a non  unity filling factor of bal material",
    ". it might be that the spatial extent or cross section of any scattering material is diminutive .",
    "on the other hand , an edge  on viewing angle might be difficult to understand in view of the larger overall velocity spread predicted by some models for such an orientation ( e.g.  see fig .",
    "5@xmath198 of @xcite ) .",
    "whatever the viewing angle , the kinematics of the absorption and the presence of and detached troughs suggest that the bal flow material does not have uniform ionization and/or density structure .",
    "the velocities of the secondary , or detached troughs , are @xmath220   for and @xmath5   for ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "though they are narrower , these troughs are more typical of the non  black , flat  bottomed , saturated profiles seen in higher velocity bals ( e.g.  @xcite ) . since the detached trough is at a lower velocity than the detached trough , the ionization condition may decrease with outflow velocity .",
    "this is contradictory to models that predict constant ionization [ see de  kool ( 1997 ) and references therein ] or increasing ionization ( e.g.  @xcite ) with outflow velocity .",
    "for the , either the continuum source is not absorbed ( occulted ) or the trough is significantly filled in by photons .",
    "the latter would imply that any material that scatters light back into the line of sight would be at relatively high velocities with respect to the quasar .",
    "it should be noted that there is absorption structure along the red wing of the emission line that may be due to even higher velocity gas ( see upper panel of figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) . in the case of , at least part of the continuum source is absorbed , or the source of photons filling in the absorption trough is not as strong as for the .",
    "double  trough broad absorption from has been investigated as a possible signature of line  driven radiation pressure .",
    "since all absorbing species experience the same flow , they each have the same optical depth modulation , showing a reduced optical depth due to increased flux from the emission line .",
    "the so  called `` ghost of '' effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) corresponds to a `` hump '' in the absorption at @xmath221  , the velocity of the emission peak in the rest  frame of ions . given the exceptionally strong absorption , pc  1415 + 3408 is a good candidate for exhibiting this modulation if the material is driven by radiation pressure .",
    "the ghost of effect is not seen in pc  1415 + 3408 ; however , we point out that the absorption terminates at @xmath222   and that this termination could be induced by the effect .",
    "despite significant efforts , the overall multi  band statistical properties of quasars exhibiting bal flows are not yet on a solid statistical footing .",
    "overall , bal quasars are radio  quiet ( e.g.  @xcite ) and quiet , or self  absorbed , in soft x  rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the first survey has produced examples of radio  selected , radio  loud bal quasars ( @xcite ) , and there are now a few x  ray loud bal quasars observed in hard x  rays ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; and see predictions of @xcite ) . for radio",
    " loud bal quasars , the radio spectra have a range of spectral indices ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is not unexpected that x  ray spectra would as well .    the x  ray spectra of mini ",
    "bal quasars may be a key for understanding bal flows .",
    "for example , assuming radiation pressure driven flow dynamics , murray et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) predict that quasars with harder ( flatter ) x  ray spectra , will have wind terminal velocities no greater than @xmath223  .",
