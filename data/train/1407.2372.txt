    "the properties of hadrons are determined by highly nonperturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in some cases ,",
    "however , the mass of hadrons can be expressed by a systematic expansion of certain qcd parameters .",
    "the mass of hadrons with light quarks is expanded by the light quark mass @xmath2 in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "when the hadron contains one heavy quark , its mass can be given in powers of the inverse of the heavy quark mass @xmath3 , with the leading contribution of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to express the mass of hadrons in the @xmath5 expansion  @xcite .",
    "these expansions dictate the scaling laws of the hadron mass as functions of the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 , and @xmath5 with @xmath7 being the nonperturbative energy scale of qcd .",
    "the leading contribution of the expansions is determined by the construction of hadrons .",
    "for instance , the mass of the nambu - goldstone bosons scales with @xmath8 , while the expansion of other light hadrons contains a constant term as the leading contribution . in the heavy sector",
    ", the mass of the singly heavy hadrons primarily scales as @xmath9 for the heavy quark mass and @xmath10 for the light quark mass .",
    "the ordinary mesons and ordinary baryons behave as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the higher order corrections can also be calculated systematically .",
    "the mass scaling is useful , for instance , to extrapolate the results of the lattice qcd simulation to the physical quark mass region .    because each hadron has its own scaling law",
    ", one may encounter the situation where a hadron mass goes across a two - hadron threshold with the same quantum numbers .",
    "for instance , the signal of the @xmath13 dibaryon is found as a stable bound state in the heavy @xmath2 region in lattice qcd  @xcite , while it is considered to become a resonance slightly above the @xmath14 threshold at the physical point  @xcite .",
    "in fact , many hadron resonances are obtained as stable bound states in the heavy @xmath2 simulation , because the lowest two - hadron threshold usually contains the pion whose mass grows as @xmath15 .    when the hadron mass moves across the threshold , one may naively expect that the same scaling law with the bound state energy describes the real part of the resonance energy above the threshold .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the threshold dynamics at the hadronic level is also highly nonperturbative  @xcite . for instance , the two - body scattering length in the @xmath1-wave channel diverges when the binding energy is sent to zero .",
    "thus , the coupling effect to the two - hadron channel should be carefully examined in the threshold energy region .",
    "the mass scaling considered in the following is the case when a hadron ( hereafter called the bare state ) approaches a two - body threshold from the lower energy side .",
    "only the lowest energy two - body threshold is taken into account among the possible states having the same quantum numbers with the bare state .",
    "this two - body channel will be referred to as the scattering channel .",
    "thus , the analysis focuses on the elastic two - body scattering .",
    "the near - threshold kinematics is discussed where the nonrelativistic treatment is applicable .",

    "it is considered that the scaling of @xmath28 is known with respect to the qcd parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the scaling of the eigenenergy of the coupled - channel hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "this enables one to relate the eigenenergy @xmath31 and the bare state energy @xmath27 .",
    "first , consider the eigenenergy of the system   for a fixed @xmath29 . to this end",
    ", the bound state channel is eliminated by the feshbach method  @xcite .",
    "the effective potential which acts on the scattering channel @xmath23 is given by @xmath32 by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation , the two - body scattering amplitude is obtained as @xmath33 where the self - energy is defined as @xmath34 the eigenenergy @xmath31 of the hamiltonian is identified from the pole of the amplitude  , namely , @xmath35 for a sufficiently large @xmath36 , the self - energy behaves as @xmath37 where the scattering state contribution is suppressed and the eigenenergy behaves as @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the effect of the scattering channel is negligible in the energy region far away from the threshold , and the scaling of the eigenenergy @xmath30 can be well described by the scaling of the bare mass @xmath28 , as naively expected .",
    "nontrivial behavior emerges near the threshold .",
    "to focus on the near - threshold phenomena , the qcd parameter @xmath29 is adjusted such that the eigenenergy appears exactly on top of the threshold @xmath39 .",
