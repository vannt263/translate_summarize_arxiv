    "@xcite this discrepancy might be related to the fact that the @xmath22 estimates from the temperature dependent mssbauer spectra reflect , to a large extent , the phonon frequencies related to the mssbauer atom ( @xmath0fe ) , whereas specific heat capacity involves more uniform average .",

    "the @xmath0fe hyperfine parameters of the yb - based heavy fermion ybfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 and nearly ferromagnetic fermi liquid compound lufe@xmath1zn@xmath2 are virtually indistinguishable . possibly the effects of additional electron correlations below the kondo temperature of @xmath58 k in ybfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 , @xcite as probed on the fe site , are small in comparison with the effects of strongly correlated fermi liquid governed by the transition metal density of states.@xcite    the quadrupole splitting values are governed by the local environment of the fe atoms ( fig .",

    "the ferromagnetic transition in gdfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 is seen in @xmath0fe mssbauer spectra as appearance of a sextet ( fig .",

    "the value of the hyperfine field for @xmath5 is @xmath38 t , that is @xmath60 higher than @xmath61 t measured in dyfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite it is possible that the crystal electric field effect present in dyfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 and absent in gdfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 should be considered in the analysis of this difference .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath0fe site hyperfine field in gdfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 allows us to address the question of interpretation of the strong deviation of the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility from the curie - weiss law between @xmath62 and @xmath63 k , discussed in ref .",
    "absence of hyperfine field on the @xmath0fe site at and above 90 k , argues against the picture of formation of magnetic droplets consisting of the gd@xmath64 local moments and oppositely polarized electron cloud , leaving the hypothesis of the temperature dependent coupling between gd@xmath7 local moments as more viable .",
    "to summarize , we performed measurements of @xmath0fe mssbauer spectra for _ r_fe@xmath1zn@xmath2 ( _ r _ = lu , yb , gd ) from @xmath3 k to room temperature .",

    "the @xmath34 data can be fitted with the function based on the curie - bloch equation for saturation magnetization that yields the value of @xmath31 at @xmath5 of @xmath6 t. no features in the mssbauer spectra were associated with the yb - based heavy fermion behavior in the ybfe@xmath1zn@xmath2 at low temperatures .",
