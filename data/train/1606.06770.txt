    "@xmath0 decay measurements provide not only important information on the structure of the daughter and parent nuclei , but can also be used to inform nuclear astrophysics studies and probe fundamental subatomic symmetries @xcite . the link between experimental results and theory",
    "is given by the reduced transition probabilities , @xmath3 .",
    "experimental @xmath3 values involve three measured quantities : the half - life , @xmath5 , the @xmath6 value of the transition , which determines the statistical phase space factor @xmath7 , and the branching ratio associated with that transition , @xmath8 .    in the standard @xmath9 description of @xmath0 decay ,",
    "@xmath3 values are related to the fundamental constants of the weak interaction and the matrix elements through this equation :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a constant and @xmath12 are the vector ( axial ) coupling constants of the weak interaction ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the spin and isospin operators , respectively . thus , a comparison of the experimental @xmath3 values with the theoretical ones obtained from the calculated matrix elements is a good test of the nuclear wave functions obtained with model calculations .",
    "however , to reproduce the @xmath3 values measured experimentally , the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath15 involved in gamow - teller transitions has to be renormalized @xcite .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath16 is deduced empirically from experimental results and depends on the mass of the nucleus : the quenching factor is @xmath17 in the @xmath18 shell @xcite , @xmath19 in the @xmath20 shell @xcite , and @xmath21 in the @xmath22 shell @xcite . despite several theoretical approaches attempting to reveal the origin of the quenching factor",
    "it is still not fully understood @xcite .",
    "another phenomenon which shows the limitations of our theoretical models is the so - called _",
    "@xmath0-decay mirror asymmetry_. if we assume that the nuclear interaction is independent of isospin , the theoretical description of @xmath0 decay is identical for the decay of a proton ( @xmath23 ) or a neutron ( @xmath24 ) inside a nucleus . therefore , the @xmath3 values corresponding to analog transitions should be identical .",
    "any potential asymmetries are quantified by the asymmetry parameter @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 refers to the @xmath27 decays in the mirror nuclei .",
    "the average value of this parameter is @xmath28 for @xmath18 and @xmath20 shell nuclei @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the mirror asymmetry can have two origins : ( a ) the possible existence of exotic _ second - class currents _",
    "@xcite , which are not allowed within the framework of the standard @xmath9 model of the weak interaction and ( b ) the breaking of the isospin symmetry between the initial or final nuclear states .",
    "shell - model calculations were performed to test the isospin non - conserving part of the interaction in @xmath0 decay @xcite . the main contribution to the mirror asymmetry from the nuclear structure",
    "was found to be from the difference in the matrix elements of the gamow - teller operator ( @xmath29 ) , because of isospin mixing and/or differences in the radial wave functions .",
    "large mirror asymmetries have been reported for transitions involving halo states @xcite .",
    "for example , the asymmetry parameter for the @xmath30 mirror decays @xmath31ne@xmath32f and @xmath31n@xmath32o to the first excited states of the respective daughters was measured to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 in two independent experiments @xcite .",
    "this result was interpreted as evidence for a proton halo in the first excited state of @xmath31f assuming that the fraction of the @xmath35 component of the valence nucleons remains the same in @xmath31ne and @xmath31n .",
    "however , a different interpretation was also given in terms of charge dependent effects which increase the @xmath35 fraction in @xmath31ne by about 50% @xcite .",
    "the latter result is also consistent with the high cross section obtained in the fragmentation of @xmath31ne @xcite , suggesting the existence of a halo in @xmath31ne .",
    "more recently kanungo _ et al .",
    "_ reported the possiblity of a two - proton halo in @xmath31ne @xcite .",
    "an extremely large mirror asymmetry was also observed in the mirror decay of @xmath36 isobars @xmath37li@xmath38be and @xmath37c@xmath38b .",
    "a value of @xmath39 was reported for the @xmath37li and @xmath37c @xmath0-decay transitions to the 11.8 and 12.2 mev levels of their respective daughters , which is the largest ever measured @xcite . despite the low experimental interaction cross sections measured with various targets in attempts to establish the halo nature of @xmath37c @xcite , recent results at intermediate energies @xcite , together with the anomalous magnetic moment @xcite and theoretical predictions @xcite , make @xmath37c a proton halo candidate .",
    "the potential relationship between large mirror asymmetries and halos is therefore clear .",
    "precision measurements of mirror asymmetries in states involved in strong , isolated , @xmath0-decay transitions might provide a technique to probe halo nuclei that is complementary to total interaction cross section and momentum distribution measurements in knockout reactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 decay of proton - rich nuclei can be used for nuclear astrophysics studies .",
    "large @xmath40-values of these nuclei not only allow the population of the bound excited states of the daughter , but also open particle emission channels . some of these levels correspond to astrophysically significant resonances which can not be measured directly because of limited radioactive beam intensities .",
    "for example , the @xmath41 reaction @xcite plays an important role in the abundance of the cosmic @xmath1-ray emitter @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of this reaction is to reduce the amount of ground state @xmath42 , which is bypassed by the sequence @xmath43 , reducing therefore the intensity of the 1809-kev @xmath1-ray line characteristic of the @xmath42 @xmath0 decay @xcite .",
