    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) might be scaled - up galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( gbhs ) ( e.g. , mchardy et al . 2006 ) since both are powered by similar physical process , i.e. , accretion onto ( super - massive and stellar - mass , respectively ) black hole .",
    "therefore , it is important and fundamental to explore the observational similarities between the two classes of black hole accreting system on very different scales .",
    "because it originates in the region mostly close to the black hole , the x - ray emission carries the most pivotal messages for the black hole accretion process .",
    "both agns and gbhs exhibit strong x - ray variability , which is usually quantified by the power spectral density ( psd ; @xmath2 ) of their x - ray light curves .",
    "the gbh psds between 0.001 and 100  hz are closely related to their x - ray spectral states ( e.g. , done & gierliski 2005 ; klein - wolt & van der klis 2008 ) .",
    "a template source mostly quoted is the persistent source , cyg  x-1 . in its low / hard state at which the energy spectrum is dominated by a strongly variable power - law component , the hard - state psd of cyg  x-1",
    "is approximately described by a doubly - broken power law ( e.g. , pottschmidt et al .",
    "2003 ) , flattening from @xmath3 to @xmath4 at the ( high-)frequency break ( @xmath5 a few hz ) and further flattening to @xmath6 at the low - frequency break ( @xmath7 a few tenth hz ) from high to low frequencies . the ratio of the two break frequencies is @xmath8 . in its high / soft state ,",
    "albeit the energy spectrum is dominated by a roughly constant thermal disc component , the highly variable power - law component is strong enough to construct the soft - state psd of cyg  x-1 , which is significantly distinguished from the hard - state psd by showing only one ( high - frequency ) break ( @xmath9  hz ) . the soft - state psd slope above and below @xmath10 is @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and the @xmath11 slope can be extended down to many decades of frequencies without further flattening ( e.g. , axelsson , borgonovo , & larsson 2006 ) . however , as already shown by pottschmidt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , even in cyg  x-1 , the gbh psd shape is not as simple as usually assumed .",
    "if the x - ray variability timescale linearly scales with black hole mass ( @xmath12 ) from gbhs to agns , the state - transition timescales of a few days found in gbhs ( @xmath13 ) suggest that agns of @xmath14 would show state transitions on timescales of a few thousand years .",
    "thus , the state transitions of agns can not be verified by direct x - ray observations if agns do have state transitions behaving like gbhs and satisfy the generally accepted scaling law .",
    "nevertheless , if we believe that agns have the same underlying variability mechanism as gbhs , the different sub - classes of agns might be reasonably assumed to correspond to different spectral states of gbhs .",
    "in fact , this assumption can be tested by comparing the psds of different types of agns with those of gbhs in different spectral states .",
    "however , the scaling of timescale with mass ascertain that it is very time - consuming to derive agn psds .",
    "compared to gbhs , the limited durations and low signal - to - noise ratios of agn light curves usually produce incomplete and low quality psds . as a result , it is not easy to constrain psd shapes and the important break frequencies for a large number of agns .",
    "relatively high quality agn psds obtained so far , actually available for a limited number ( about a dozen ) of seyfert galaxies only , are almost analogous to gbh soft - state psds ( e.g. , uttley & mchardy 2005 ) .",
    "the psds of seyfert galaxies show one break ( @xmath10 ) only , flattening from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . with present data ,",
    "the psds do not show further flattening down to the lowest frequencies ( @xmath17  hz ) which are @xmath18 decades lower than the break frequencies . like gbhs in the high / soft state ,",
    "the fact that seyfert galaxies show the soft - state psds are strongly supported by their low radio fluxes and high accretion rates larger than two percent of the edington accretion rate at which cyg  x-1 transits between the hard and soft spectral states ( e.g. , maccarone et al . 2003 ) .",
    "up to now , ark  564 and ngc  3783 are the only agns whose psd shows the second , low - frequency break ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "ark  564 has strong evidence for the second break in its psd ( pounds et al .",
    "2001 ; papadakis et al .",
    "2002 ; markowitz et al . 2003 ; mchardy et al .",
    "2007 ) . nevertheless , the very high ( possibly super - eddington ) accretion rate ( @xmath20 , romano et al .",
    "2004 ) suggests that ark  564 may resemble gbhs in the very high state rather than in the low / hard state ( mchardy et al .",
    "2007 ) , since in the very high state gbh psds show two distinct breaks as well .",
    "the second break in the psd of ngc  3783 , firstly presented by markowitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , was questioned by summons et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with the improved psd .",
    "moreover , the moderately high accretion rate ( @xmath21 , uttley & mchardy 2005 ) and radio quietness ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 ) suggest that ngc  3783 is analogous to gbhs in the high / soft state .",
    "therefore , ngc  3783 also became one of agns showing soft - state psd , which leaves ark  564 as the only non - soft - state agn .",
    "the x - ray variability of agns can also be quantified with the normalized excess variance ( @xmath22 ) of their x - ray light curves , which is approximately equal to the integral of the normalized psds of the same light curves ( e.g. , vaughan et al .",
    "2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "because it is much more easier to calculate the variances than to calculate the psds , the variances have been used to explore the scaling relation of the x - ray variability with black hole mass , i.e. , the so - called variance - mass ( @xmath23 ) relationship , and x - ray luminosity of agns .",
    "on timescale of about half day , the variance anti - correlates with mass ( i.e. , @xmath24 ; e.g. , lu & yu 2001 ; bian & zhao 2003 ; liu & zhang 2008 ; zhou et al . 2010 ) and x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , nandra et al . 1997 ) . by scaling with cyg  x-1 ,",
    "the variance has been used as a method to estimate @xmath12 of agns ( nikolajuk et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ; 2009 ; gierliski et al . 2008 ; zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although the variance of an individual source does nothing for constraining agn psds , the variance - mass relation , just requiring to calculate variances of a large sample of agns with known masses , has this function .",
    "if agns have the same underlying x - ray variability mechanism that scales with mass , the variance - mass relation can be reproduced from a universal agn psd model .",
    "the comparison between the observed and predicted variance - mass relation can determine agn psd shape and the scaling factors of its parameters with mass . for",
    "10 seyfert galaxies , which have been regularly observed in x - rays , the 210  kev variances calculated with 300-day long rxte pca light curves anti - correlate with masses , which can be fitted by the hard - state psd model ( papadakis 2004 ) . with asca light curves of about half - day long for a larger sample of agns , oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained a similar anti - correlation between variances and masses , which is also in agreement with the prediction of the hard - state psd model . using @xmath25 data on timescale of about half day , papadakis et al .",
    "( 2008b ) and miniutti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) enlarged the agn sample , especially objects with smaller masses , for the variance - mass relation .",
    "papadakis et al .",
    "( 2008a ) also extended the study of the variance - mass relation to higher red - shift agns .",
    "the studies of variance - mass relationship suggest that agns have the hard - state psds , which apparently is in contradiction with the conclusion that agns have the soft - state psds from the direct psd analysis .",
    "importantly , the agn samples of papadakis ( 2004 ) and oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) include most of agns whose soft - state psds have been well determined .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency could be mainly due to the short duration of the light curves used to calculate the variances .",
    "in fact , even though agns do have the hard - state psds , the short timescale variances do not cover the frequencies where the low - frequency breaks locate for most of agns . on short timescales ,",
    "the hard - state psd predicts the same variance - mass relation as the soft - state psd does .",
    "short timescale variance - mass relation is thus not able to differentiate the two psd models .",
    "consequently , in order to demonstrate whether agn psds have the second breaks , it is necessary to obtain variance - mass relation with very long timescale light curves , especially for agns with large masses .",
    "the values of @xmath19 for the gbh hard - state psds are about a few tenth of one hz .",
    "if agns do show the hard - state psds , by scaling law of @xmath19 with mass , @xmath19 would be @xmath26  hz ( on the order of one year ) for agns with @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , in order to effectively distinguish the two agn psd models with variance - mass relation , a large number of agns should be continuously monitored for tens of years .",
    "the longest data stream with roughly continuous and regular sampling mode are from the asm onboard rxte .",
    "the asm has been monitoring a large number of agns since january 1996 . in this paper",
    ", we will use the asm data to obtain the variances of 27 agns on the longest timescale so far , with which we are in an attempt to differentiate the two agn psd models .",
    "the asm operates in the 1.5 to 12 kev energy band and scans most of the sky every 1.5 hours .",
    "we start our analysis with the data of the one - day averages from the asm quick - look pageslc.html ] .",
    "each one - day averaged data is the average of the fitted source fluxes from a number ( typically 5 to 10 ) of individual 90 second dwells over that day , and is quoted as the nominal 210  kev asm count rate ( counts per second ) .",
    "we make use of the full asm data stream from 1996 january 1 to 2009 december 31 ( modified julian day [ mjd ] @xmath27 ) , which provides 14-year long x - ray light curves for a large number of agns . in the asm quick - look pages , we select agns having a measurement of black hole mass in the literatures . our final sample , tabulated in table  [ tab : agn ] , contains 27 agns , including 20 broad - line seyfert 1 ( bls1 ) and 7 narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies . among them , we find bolometric luminosity of 20 agns and psd break timescale ( @xmath28 ) of 12 agns in the literatures .    due to low sensitivity , the asm signal - noise ratios are quite low for agns . as two examples , the left plots of figure  [ fig : mrk335 ] and figure  [ fig : ic4329a ] show the background - subtracted one - day averaged asm light curves for the lowest and highest count rate object mrk  335 and ic  4329a among our agn sample , respectively .",
    "it can been seen that the one - day averaged light curves contain many negative count rates .",
    "the light curves do not show legible variability trend either , mainly caused by strong poisson noise . in order to acquire meaningful variability information of agns from the asm data ,",
    "it is necessary to rebin the one - day averaged light curves over very long timescale ( e.g. , 300  days as used in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the right plots of figure  [ fig : mrk335 ] and figure  [ fig : ic4329a ] present the 300-day averaged light curves of mrk  335 and ic  4329a , showing that the two objects are indeed variable on such long timescale , though the errors are still large . for comparisons ,",
    "the 300-day averaged light curves are also plotted on top of their respective one - day averaged light curves in the left plots of figure  [ fig : mrk335 ] and figure  [ fig : ic4329a ] .",
    "onboard rxte , the proportional counter array ( pca ) is much more sensitive than the asm . to judge the quality of the asm light curves , we compare the light curves obtained with pca and asm in the same time intervals .",
    "we choose two objects , namely ic  4329a and ngc  3227 , to perform this comparison .",
    "the pca monitored ic  4329a once every 4.26 days for a duration of 4.3 years , from 2003 april 8 to 2007 august 7 ( mjd @xmath29 ; observation identifiers 80152 - 03 , 80152 - 04 , 90154 - 01 , 91138 - 01 , and 92108 - 01 ; see markowitz 2009 ) .",
    "ngc  3227 was monitored by the pca with different observing schemes ( see uttley & mchardy 2005 for the details ) for a duration of 7.4 years , from 1999 march 23 to 2006 august 13 ( mjd @xmath30 ; observation identifiers 40151 - 01 , 40151 - 08 , 40151 - 09 , 50153 - 07 , 50153 - 08 , 60133 - 05 , 70142 - 01 , 80154 - 01 , 90160 - 04 ) .",
    "we obtained the long - term pca light curves of the two objects from heasarc archive data search form , in which we selected `` xte target index catalog '' and downloaded the merged light curves .",
    "we then re - selected the one - day averaged asm light curves of the two objects in the same time intervals as spanned by their long term pca light curves .",
    "both the pca and asm light curves are averaged over 300  days , which are shown in figure  [ fig : pca ] . in order to compare the pca and asm light curves easily , they are normalized to their respective mean count rates .",
    "although the discrepancies of the normalized count rates between the asm and pca light curves are present in some points of the light curves and the pca errors are much smaller than the asm ones , the asm light curves could still be thought to roughly track the pca ones on binsize of 300  days .",
    "therefore , the 300-day averaged asm light curves can be used to study long - term variability of agns .    in the case of the heavily binned asm light curves , the sampled psd at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the binsize of the light curves )",
    "might be massively affected by aliasing effects , specially because of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the duration of the light curves ) for most of objects .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath22 ( see formula  [ [ eq : nxs ] ] for the definition ) is not equal to the integral of the intrinsic psd between @xmath37 and @xmath31 .",
    "this should not be a serious problem , as it should affect all sources in a similar way .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth investigating this aliasing effect by simulating a red - noise light curve .",
    "we follow the procedure described by timmer & k@xmath38nig ( 1995 ) to fake a light curve ( see zhang 2002 and zhang et al .",
    "2004 for the details ) by assuming a single power - law psd ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the psd normalization factor ) .",
    "the experiment is performed twice , one with slope of @xmath41 and in the second case with @xmath42 . in order to closely imitate the asm light curves",
    ", we produce a light curve with 5100 points ( one per day ) . for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider the effect of poisson noise .",
    "the light curve is normalized to have a mean count rate of 0.2 and a variance of @xmath43 .",
    "the normalized variance is the integral of the intrinsic psd between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46  days and @xmath47  day correspond to the length and binsize of the simulated light curve . under these assumptions",
    ", one can derive the value of @xmath40 , which is @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . with the known @xmath40",
    ", we can calculate the value of the integral of the intrinsic psd between any frequency range . for the case of @xmath46  days and @xmath50  days ,",
    "the integral is @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the simulated light curve is then rebinned with @xmath50  days ( i.e. , the binsize of our asm light curves ) , resulting in 17 bins ( one per 300  days ) , and its normalized variance , @xmath53 , is estimated . the aliasing effect can be examined by comparing the value of @xmath53 with that of @xmath54 .",
    "the procedure is repeated by 1000 times , from which we obtain the median and error ( @xmath55 confidence level ) of @xmath53 , which is @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the psd slope of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath54 values are thus approximately equal to the median values of @xmath53 for both cases of the psds .",
    "figure  [ fig : prob ] presents the probability distribution of @xmath53 , where the @xmath54 value and the @xmath53 median are also plotted , showing that the @xmath54 value is very close to the peak ( or the median ) of the @xmath53 sample for both cases .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that the estimated @xmath22 are not significantly affected by the heavy binning of light curves .",
    "therefore , the @xmath22 values of the 300-day averaged asm light curves ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) are a good estimator of the integral of the intrinsic psd .",
    "the normalized excess variance , @xmath22 , of a light curve is defined as ( e.g. , zhang et al .",

    "( 2003 ) .",
    "a light cure is characterized by its duration , @xmath36 , and binsize , @xmath33 .",
    "the psd of the light curve can be estimated at frequencies between the minimum frequency , @xmath64 , and the maximum frequency , @xmath32 ( i.e. , the nyquist frequency ) .",
    "the agn hard - state psd",
    "( e.g. , oneill et al .",
    "2005 ) is defined as the doubly - broken power law , with slope @xmath65 below the low - frequency break ( @xmath19 ) , slope @xmath11 between @xmath19 and the high - frequency break ( @xmath10 ) , and slope @xmath66 above @xmath10 , @xmath67",

    "the first one assumes that @xmath10 inversely scales with @xmath12 in the form of @xmath72 by fitting the hard - state psd predictions ( see section  [ sec : hard ] ) to the short - timescale variance - mass relation , oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained @xmath73 ( hz @xmath74 ) . using longer timescale variance - mass relation , papadakis ( 2004 ) also found similar value for @xmath75 .",
    "the second assumption for @xmath10 is that @xmath10 depends not only on @xmath12 , but also on bolometric luminosity , @xmath76 .",
    "based on the results from psd analysis of the light curves of ten agns and two gbhs , mchardy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) obtained the following relation , @xmath77 which shows that @xmath10 ( in unit of day@xmath78 ) roughly inversely scales with the square of @xmath12 ( in unit of @xmath79 ) and roughly linearly scales with @xmath76 ( in unit of @xmath80erg s@xmath78 ) from gbhs to agns .",
    "note that these two assumptions ( formulae  [ [ eq : cb ] [ and  [ [ eq : tml ] ] ) are not consistent with each other , although @xmath10 has stronger dependence on @xmath12 than on @xmath76 in the second assumption .",
    "in the hard - state psd model , the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath19 , marked as @xmath81 , is assumed to be same for all agns .",
    "because the short - timescale variance - mass relation can not constrain the value of @xmath81 , oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) fixed @xmath82 in their fits , assuming that agns have similar values of @xmath81 to those of gbh hard - state psds .",

    "the psd normalization factor @xmath83 is the power at @xmath10 .",
    "the `` universal psd amplitude '' , defined as @xmath84 , is assumed to be the same for all agns . based on the fit to the variance - mass relation with the hard - state psd prediction , oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained @xmath85 , similar to the one found by papadakis ( 2004 ) .",
    "nevertheless , constant @xmath86 ( i.e. , same for all objects ) is an assumption only .",
    "if @xmath86 is not constant , then formulae  [ [ eq : soft1 ] ] and  [ [ eq : hard1 ] ] should not predict a constant @xmath22 either .    by definition",

    "therefore , the values of @xmath86 and @xmath75 , derived from the fits of the hard - state psd predictions to the observed variance - mass relations ( oneill et al . 2005 ; papadakis 2004 ) , also apply to the soft - state psd model .",
    "if the hypothesized psds are able to describe the x - ray variability of agns , the observed variance of a light curve is approximately equal to the predicted variance by integrating the psd over the frequency range between @xmath37 and @xmath31 , @xmath87 the predicted @xmath22 can be analytically expressed in terms of the parameters of both the light curve and the psd , depending on where the break frequencies locate with respect to @xmath37 and @xmath31 .      if @xmath88 , the predicted variance , integrated the psd over slope @xmath66 range only , linearly scales with @xmath10 , @xmath89    if @xmath90 , the predicted variance , integrated the psd over slope of @xmath11 range only , is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath91    if @xmath92 , the predicted variance is @xmath93      if @xmath88 , the predicted variance , integrated the psd over slope @xmath66 range only , linearly scales with @xmath10 , @xmath94 which is the same to formula  [ [ eq : soft2 ] ] .    if @xmath95 , the predicted variance , integrated the psd over slope of @xmath11 range only , is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath96 which is the same to formula  [ [ eq : soft1 ] ] .    if @xmath97 , the predicted variance is @xmath98 which is the same to formula  [ [ eq : soft12 ] ] .",

    "if @xmath10 scales with @xmath12 only , the psd predictions ( formulae  [ [ eq : soft2]-[eq : hard0 ] ] ) can be further expressed in terms of @xmath12 by substituting @xmath10 with @xmath106 .",
    "in such a way , if @xmath107 , the variance linearly inversely scales with @xmath12 in both the psd models .",
    "the hard - state psd predicts that the variance linearly scales with @xmath12 if @xmath108 , which does not exist for the soft - state psd .    on short timescales , even if @xmath109 ( but @xmath110 ) , the two psd models predict the same variance - mass relation ( see formula  [ [ eq : soft2][eq : hard12 ] ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the observed short - term variance - mass relations can not be used to differentiate the soft - state from the hard - state psd model . in order to effectively distinguish the two psd models ,",
    "the variance should be measured with long - term light curve whose length is long enough to have @xmath111 , because on this sufficiently long timescales the soft - state psd prediction is different from the hard - state psd prediction .",

    "if taking into account the scaling of @xmath10 with both @xmath12 and @xmath76 , the predicted variance can be further expressed in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath76 by substituting @xmath10 with formula  [ [ eq : tml ] ] . in this case , it is impossible to describe the variance as the function of mass ( or luminosity ) separately .",
    "for the correct psd model , however , the predicted variances would be equal to the observed variances .",
    "of course , a number of agns should be monitored for sufficiently long time ( requiring @xmath111 ) with regular sampling rate in order to determine whether agn psds have the second , low - frequency break or not .",
    "reliable estimation of observed @xmath22 requires that the light curve has high signal - to - noise ratio and enough data points .",
    "however , the asm sensitivity is not sufficient to directly calculate the variances from the one - day averaged light curves ( see discussion of section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "by re - binning the one - day averages over longer time interval , it is possible to obtain light curves with good signal - to - noise ratios . even though the rebinning reduces the number of data points and conceals short - term variability , it is still meaningful to acquire long - timescale variability of agns .",
    "this is also in accordance with our purpose to estimate long - timescale variances for differentiating the two psd models hypothesized for agns . to assure the use of @xmath112 statistics and to substantially increase signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "we compromisingly rebin the one - day averaged light curves with binsize of @xmath50  days .",
    "the count rate in each new bin is obtained by weightily averaging all the original one - day averages in that bin .",
    "this procedure of rebinning results in 17 data points in the 300-day averaged light curve for each source .",
    "the values of @xmath22 calculated with the re - binned light curves are listed in table  [ tab : agn ] .",
    "the rebinned light curves have binsize of @xmath50  days and length of @xmath46  days .",

    "however , the failure of the hard - state psd prediction merely shows that a very specific version of the hard - state psd model does not fit the data .",
    "this does not prove that the hard - state psd model , with another set of parameter values can not fit the data ( to some extent ) . among the three parameters , @xmath131 , the scaling of @xmath10 with mass , is best determined and mostly impossible to change a lot . as we will discuss in section  [ sec : scatter ] , the value of @xmath86 , primarily due to the intrinsic scatter of variance measurements , may range from 0.008 up to 0.052 . in figure",

    "in fact , the hard - state psd predictions , within the @xmath86 range adopted above , are about @xmath134 order of magnitude smaller than the observed variances for @xmath135 .",
    "this indicates that , down to frequencies of @xmath136  hz , the psds of these agns should not show the second low - frequency breaks . in order to test this assumption",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig : mass ] ( the magenta solid line ) the hard - state psd prediction by setting @xmath137 , which explains the data much better than the case of @xmath125 .",
    "thus , our long timescale variance - mass relation does not favor @xmath125 assumed by oneill et al .",

    ", our long timescale variance - mass relation is very likely to agree with the soft - state psd prediction rather than with the hard - state psd predictions .      on short timescales , the observed variance anti - correlates with x - ray luminosity of agns ( e.g. , nandra et al .",

    "the soft - state psd deservedly predicts that the variance is independent of @xmath76 , suggesting that formula  [ [ eq : tml ] ] is consistent with the lack of any correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , the hard - state psd with @xmath125 would predict that the variance decreases with increasing bolometric luminosity .      for the soft - state psd model ,",

    "this is inconsistent with the assumption that the value of @xmath86 is the same for all agns .",

    "consequently , the scatter of the estimated variances does not imply the intrinsic scatter of @xmath86 .",
    "the way to reduce the intrinsic scatter of variance measurements is to average a number of estimated variances . as a result , in order to obtain the constant @xmath86 and reduce its uncertainty , we average the observed variances of our 27 agns and derive its standard deviation , which is @xmath153 . with formula  [ [ eq : soft1 ] ] , we obtain @xmath154 .",

    "most probably , the uncertainty in the best fit @xmath86 does not indicate a range of intrinsic @xmath86 , but rather indicates the true uncertainty with which one can estimate the constant @xmath86 with the present psds .",
    "nevertheless , one could average the known values of @xmath86 from the best fits to the high - quality psds of a few agns as an approximate value of the constant @xmath86 .",
    "the averaged value of @xmath86 ( @xmath156 ) is also similar to the one we obtained from the average of the observed variances of a number of agns under the assumption of the soft - state psd shape .",
    "formula  [ [ eq : tml ] ] shows that @xmath10 depends on both @xmath12 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is therefore inadequate to study the @xmath158 and @xmath159 relation , respectively .",
    "if taking into account the scaling of @xmath10 with @xmath12 and @xmath76 synchronously , we have to compare the observed variances with the ones predicted by the psd models , i.e. , a projection of the @xmath157 plane .",
    "the predictions are calculated with the soft - state and hard - state psd , respectively , with the values of @xmath10 calculated with formula  [ [ eq : tml ] ] and @xmath144 estimated in section  [ sec : scatter ] .",

    "it is the line on which an object will lie exactly if the predicted variance is equal to the observed one . in the same way ,",
    "the two black dashed lines indicate @xmath161 deviations from the black solid line , showing the positions to which the black solid line will shift if the predicted variances are calculated with @xmath133 ( the upper black dashed line ) and @xmath132 ( the lower black dashed line ) , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the upper and bottom black dashed lines have the exactly same meanings as the black solid line if the ( soft - state or hard - state ) psd predictions are calculated with @xmath133 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "the two values of @xmath86 are the upper and lower @xmath162 deviations from @xmath144 obtained in section  [ sec : scatter ] .    due to @xmath152 ,",
    "the predicted variances by the soft - state psd are the same for all of our agns ( the magenta solid circle indicates the averaged value of the observed variances ) . as a result , the relation between the observed and predicted variances is perpendicular to the axis of the predicted variance .",
    "most of the objects lie within the @xmath162 range of the black solid line . for the hard - state psd , however , most of agns locate far away from the black solid and dashed lines . therefore , figure  [ fig : obspred ] suggests that the soft - state psd predictions are much more consistent with the data than the hard - state psd predictions , but the latter is only for the specific parameters of oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as already discussed in section  [ sec : mass ] . moreover , for the hard - state psd predictions , the majority of the most massive objects lie close to the black solid line , indicating that their values of @xmath37 are slightly smaller than the respective values of @xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "these massive agns , due to longer timescales , are not good indictors for differentiating the two psd models .",
    "with the asm data accumulated over 14 years , we estimate the normalized excess variances of 27 agns in the x - ray band on the longest timescale ( @xmath50  days and @xmath46  days ) so far .",
    "although the observed variances show quite large scatter , they appear to not depend on black hole mass and bolometric luminosity of agns .",
    "this phenomenology has already been noticed by markowitz & edelson ( 2004 ) with pca light curves of @xmath163  days and @xmath164  days .",
    "the short - timescale variance - mass relation has been able to constrain the psd amplitude and the scaling law of the psd high - break frequency with black hole mass ( papadakis 2004 ; oneill et al .",
    "2005 ) , but it can not be used to effectively distinguish the hard - state and soft - state psd models hypothesized for agns ( as they have the same predictions on short timescales ) in general . relatively , the long timescale variance - mass relation is more valid to determine whether the agn psds have the second low - frequency breaks or not .    with the best - fit parameters obtained by oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the soft - state psd prediction is much more consistent with our long timescale variance - mass relation than the hard - state psd prediction . on the longest timescale so far , the hard - state psd predicts that the variance increases with mass , whereas the soft - state psd gives the mass - independent variance .",
    "in fact , the variances predicted by the hard - state psd model are remarkably smaller than the observed variances for most of our agns . furthermore , by taking into account the scaling factor of the psd high - break frequency with black hole mass and bolometric luminosity together , the soft - state psd predictions are more likely to agree with the observed variances than the hard - state psd predictions .",
    "therefore , the long timescale variances appear to favor the soft - state rather than the hard - state psd shape for agns .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that it is the variances predicted by the best - fit psd parameters of oneill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , not by the hard - state psd in general , that are not consistent with the data .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that changes of psd amplitude within the most possible range do not improve the `` fit '' to the data .",
    "rather , the hard - state psd model could probably agree with the data , but it would require a range of psd amplitude values that have not been observed so far in the cases when a proper fitting has been done to the psds of a few sources . despite the hard - state psd predictions with @xmath165",
    "can explain the data as good as the soft - state psd predictions , such large value of @xmath166 is very probably nonexistent by scaling from gbhs to agns .",
    "moreover , the hard - state psd with @xmath165 is actually identical to the soft - state psd for the present data .    up to now , the best fits show that the high - quality psds of a few agns have one high - frequency break only except for ark  564 who exhibits the second low - frequency break .",
    "thereby , our variance analysis of a larger sample of agns agrees with the direct psd analysis of a smaller sample of agns , both implying the soft - state psd shape for agns .",
    "for example , the psds of ngc  4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , having the smallest mass among our sample , show one break only down to frequency of @xmath17  hz at quite high confidence level ( mchardy et al . 2004 ; 2005 ) . at the same time",
    ", figure  [ fig : mass ] shows that the estimated variances of the two objects , roughly consistent with the soft - state psd predictions , are remarkably larger than the variances predicted by the hard - state psd model .",
    "compared to the psd analysis , however , our variance analysis lowers the frequencies by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , our results further strengthen the standpoint , first suggested by the psd analysis , that agn psds might have one break only .    by analogy with the psds of gbhs in the high / soft state ,",
    "both the variance and psd analyzes suggest that seyfert - type agns are in the high accretion state .",
    "therefore , agns are thought to be scaled - up gbhs in the high / soft state , characterized by the psd break frequency scaling with black hole mass and bolometric luminosity ( or eddington accretion rate ) from gbhs to agns ( mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "the break frequencies of all agns in our sample are substantially smaller than the maximum frequency to which the 300-day binned light curves correspond , indicating that the estimated variances are the same for our agns .",
    "this motivate us to average the observed variances , from which we obtain a constant psd amplitude of @xmath167 for agns , roughly consistent with those obtained from the direct psd analysis and the short - timescale variance analysis .",
    "there are a number of factors which may cause the large scatter of the observed variances .",
    "one main effect may come from the low quality asm light curves for agns ( see section  [ sec : obs ] ) . from the point view of psd itself ,",
    "the slope above and below the break frequency are not exactly equal to @xmath66 and @xmath11 for most of agns , as already seen from the known agn psds ( e.g. , uttley , mchardy & papadakis 2002 ) . at the same time , the agn psds are better described by a bending power law ( e.g. , uttley & mchardy 2005 ) rather than by an abruptly broken power law assumed here for simplicity .",
    "it is worth noting that , if the soft - state psd model is applicable to agns , the observed variances should be the same .",
    "however , because the variance measurements have the known intrinsic scatter ( vaughan et al .",
    "2003 ; oneill et al .",
    "2005 ) , which could be very large , the large scatter of the estimated excess variances is almost certainly due to the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath22 values themselves . in order to decrease the intrinsic scatter of variance measurements ,",
    "it is necessary to perform high quality observations on longer timescale ( and/or multiple observations ) for agns .",
    "averaging the multiple variances of an object ( from segments of long - timescale or multiple observations ) can reduce the intrinsic uncertainty of variance measurements . due to shorter timescales ,",
    "the agns with smaller or intermediate black hole mass are more effective to differentiate the two psd models .",

    "<S> the all sky monitor ( asm ) onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has continuously monitored a number of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with similar sampling rates for 14 years from 1996 january to 2009 december . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing the archival asm data of 27 agns , we calculate the normalized excess variances of the 300-day binned x - ray light curves on the longest timescale ( between 300  days and @xmath0  years ) explored so far . </S>",
    "<S> the observed variance appears to be independent of agn black hole mass and bolometric luminosity , respectively . according to the scaling relation with black hole mass ( and bolometric luminosity ) from galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( gbhs ) to agns , </S>",
    "<S> the break timescales which correspond to the break frequencies detected in the power spectral density ( psd ) of our agns are larger than binsize ( 300  days ) of the asm light curves . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the singly - broken power - law ( soft - state ) psd predicts the variance to be independent of mass and luminosity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the doubly - broken power - law ( hard - state ) psd predicts , with the widely accepted ratio of the two break frequencies , that the variance increases with increasing mass and decreases with increasing luminosity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the independence of the observed variance on mass and luminosity suggests that agns should have the soft - state psds . if taking into account the scaling of breaking timescale with mass and luminosity synchronously , the observed variances are also more consistent with the soft - state than the hard - state psd predictions . with the averaged variance of agns and the soft - state psd assumption , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a universal psd amplitude of @xmath1 . by analogy with the gbh psds in the high / soft state </S>",
    "<S> , the longest timescale variability supports the standpoint that agns are scaled - up gbhs in the high accretion state , as already implied by the direct psd analysis . </S>"
