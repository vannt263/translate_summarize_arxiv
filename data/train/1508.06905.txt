    "random walk ( rw ) models are ubiquitous in the literature with applications in several areas , such as physics  @xcite , biology  @xcite and economy @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is the walker displacement in a sequence of independent random steps , namely ordinary rw  @xcite .",
    "one may also obtain random paths on a geometrical space with distinct displacement schemes , leading to other rw models .",
    "a fundamental importance of these models lies in the fact that many real phenomena can be mapped or directly represented by paths traversed by walkers in some geometrical space , e.g. , a single - strand dna  @xcite and magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "an example is the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) defined by a walker forming a random path that never intersects itself ; standard saws are performed on regular lattices , where the walker steps to nearest - neighbor sites and does not visit a site more than once @xcite .    because of non - overlapping paths",
    ", the saw model plays a central role in polymer physics @xcite by capturing the excluded volume effect in a dilute solution under good solvent condition or at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the saw model is also well known in statistical physics context because of its equivalence with the @xmath8-vector model with @xmath9 , as de gennes first pointed out @xcite . from this equivalence , with arguments of renormalization and field theories , one expects the following series expansion for the mean square end - to - end distance @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath6 is the leading exponent .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath11 with @xmath12 , are analytical corrections , and the terms proportional to @xmath13 with non - integer exponents @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are the non - analytical corrections to scaling .",
    "the leading and corrections to scaling exponents are universal . the indexed brackets @xmath16 refers to the @xmath0-step rw ensemble average , and from now on , unless strictly necessary , we omit the index @xmath0 .",
    "numerical estimates of exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 are based on either exact counting techniques @xcite , or in monte carlo ( mc ) simulation methods  @xcite , through the sampling of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "obtaining such estimates for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , especially for 3d saw , is a challenge from several points of view .",
    "the exponential growth of the number of possible @xmath0-step paths @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the connectivity constant and @xmath19 , imposes a limit to exact counting . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the maximum values obtained are @xmath20  @xcite and @xmath21  @xcite for saws on 2d and 3d square lattices , respectively .",
    "concerning monte carlo simulations , there exist an appeal to find @xmath6 and @xmath7 using very long paths . obtaining high quality monte carlo data for such path lengths is an extremely difficult task for the saw model .",
    "the variable length algorithms suffer from attrition problems , namely barriers that prevent paths to grow , while the fixed length algorithms suffer from the decreasing of acceptance rate to generate a new non - self - intersecting path , according to the increase of the ( fixed ) path length  @xcite .",
    "numerical drawbacks also take place when one studies other conformational quantities .",
    "an example is the persistence length , @xmath4 , defined as the mean end - to - end vector projection in a fixed direction along the first step  @xcite , as @xmath22  @xcite . defining the end - to - end vector as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the walker displacement at the @xmath2-th step ,",
    "the persistence length can be expressed by @xmath25",
    ". numerical results of @xmath4 , for 2d - saws , are controversial in the literature , and for 3d , are scarce  @xcite . for 2d - saw ,",
    "grassberger  @xcite obtained the first estimate of @xmath4 in the square lattice , by means of a power law @xmath26 , with @xmath27 . since for @xmath28 ,",
    "it is also well fitted by @xmath29 , as suggested by redner and privmann  @xcite .",
    "they obtained both estimates by sampling the displacements projections along the first step direction , for all possible configurations of saw paths with @xmath30 .",
    "this weak divergence has been questioned recently by eisenberg and baram @xcite , because their mc estimates of @xmath31 show that @xmath4 converges to a constant when @xmath22 .",
    "one could employ @xmath4 in monte carlo  @xcite and experimental characterization of certain polymers  @xcite , despite there exist some limitations of @xmath4 measures such as divergence and edge effects  @xcite .",
    "refined results about the scaling behavior of the aforementioned conformational quantities to study universality are challenging , and have been the subject of discussion for many years  @xcite . as usually one does not have exact results for the saw model ,",
    "there exists an appeal for simulations of large , sometimes very large , paths .",
    "here , one proposes to answer two questions about a saw : ( i ) what is the asymptotic limit of its persistence length ?",
    "( ii ) is there some way to find out its scaling behavior employing relatively small chains ? to answer these questions , we found an approach for performing scaling analysis of rws , by focusing in the behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we present the analytical results by defining the inner persistence length and their relation with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , for rw models statistically invariant under orthogonal transformations . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we provide a series expansion for @xmath4 and obtain the scaling behavior of 2d and 3d - saw models with monte carlo simulations ; we also obtain reliable estimates of the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 and discuss the contribution of @xmath4 to @xmath3 behavior . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we give concluding remarks .",
    "we define the inner persistence length ( ipl ) for an @xmath0-step rw , by the average dot product : @xmath32 .",
    "to relate @xmath3 to @xmath33 , and @xmath34 to @xmath4 , we write the square distance at the @xmath2-th step for an @xmath0-step rw as : @xmath35 . adding up @xmath36",
    ", we have @xmath37 , where @xmath38 leads to @xmath39 .",
    "thus , considering @xmath40 , we write the average @xmath41 . in particular for @xmath42 , the mean square end - to - end distance is @xmath43    now , consider a generic class of rws , where ensembles of @xmath0-step walks obey the following invariance property : the probability distributions , of each step @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which compose a path , is invariant under orthogonal transformations . with this",
    ", we exclude walks like the tourist model  @xcite , where the medium disorder @xcite breaks down such invariance symmetries .",
    "particularly , one considers an ensemble of @xmath0-step rws obeying the mentioned probabilistic symmetry , under a specific orthogonal transformation @xmath46 given by @xmath47 ; the prime denotes the displacement vectors in the transformed reference frame , and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 .",
    "notice that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 represents the complete ensemble of paths .",
    "this symmetry operation can be achieved by a translation followed by inversion of all displacement vectors . in other words",
    ", one does invert each path and change the origin to the end of the walk . an immediate consequence for the complete ensemble of random paths",
    "is @xmath52 , with @xmath49 , which leads to @xmath53 . from the previous relations , it follows that @xmath54 , so the configurational average @xmath55 holds .",
    "this average , for @xmath56 , is the persistence length @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the mean square end - to - end distance could be rewritten as @xmath57 and we have established a relation between @xmath58 and @xmath4 .",
    "we observed eq .",
    "[ disper_correla ] numerically , prior to its proof , by exact calculations for @xmath59 .  some rw models that obey such a relation are the @xmath0-step ensemble of ordinary rw and saw paths .",
    "from now on , we numerically study @xmath33 for saws using the non - reversed random walk ( nrrw ) algorithm to generate the ensemble of @xmath0-step non - overlapping paths . because of the attrition problem , i.e. , barriers or traps that prevent paths to achieve @xmath0 steps , the nrrw is inefficient to generate good statistics for long saws , since the probability decays as @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath61 is the attrition constant .",
    "however , the generated data with this algorithm are surprisingly good enough to validate our approach , showing that we choose the right corrections to scaling terms in the expansion of ipls .",
    "starting with @xmath3 , we now analyze the persistence length . for the square lattice ,",
    "@xmath62  @xcite and a common belief is that @xmath63  @xcite . with these exponents values , from eq .",
    "[ assintotic ] , using only the first two leading exponents , we see that @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "the same reasoning leads to a similar result for cubic lattices , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are widely accepted values @xcite . both averages in eq .",
    "[ disper_correla ] , @xmath3 and @xmath68 , are obtained considering the same @xmath0-step ensemble . in this sense",
    ", we follow our previous notation by omitting the bracket index . the difference @xmath69 seems to be the discrete derivative of square end - to - end distance , which is not true for the saw model .",
    "one should evaluate the derivative considering saw ensembles of @xmath0 and @xmath70-steps : @xmath71 . according to eq .",
    "[ assintotic ] , the leading term of @xmath72 derivative is @xmath73 with the first two corrections proportional to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . from the persistence length plots in fig .",
    "[ persistencia_plot ] , @xmath4 clearly does not diverge as the leading term of @xmath3 derivative , instead it seems to converge to a constant as @xmath0 goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "thus , we introduce the following series expansion : @xmath76 where the exponents @xmath77 , @xmath78 , are linear combinations of @xmath6 with analytical and non - analytical corrections to scaling exponents . as for example , from the persistence length data fitting with eq .",
    "[ persist_fit ] ( see fig .  [ persistencia_plot ] ) , we find that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the best choices . the @xmath81 and @xmath82 values are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : const ] .",
    "an immediate consequence of such findings along with eq .",
    "[ disper_correla ] , is that @xmath4 could contribute only with second and higher - order of analytic and non - analytic corrections for @xmath3 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath4 , for square lattices , is compatible with the one of eisenberg and baram @xcite . through their estimate of the step - step correlation",
    "scaling : @xmath83 , and the definition @xmath84 , we obtained @xmath85 , with which we fitted the persistence length data , but leaving @xmath86 free , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ persistencia_plot](a ) .",
    "[ htpb ]    .[tab : const ] coefficients and exponents for fitting , with eq .",
    "[ persist_fit ] , the @xmath4 data obtained from simulations for 2d and 3d square lattices .",
    "the @xmath87 value is an effective exponent , thus depending on the coefficients @xmath81 and exponents @xmath82 of eq .",
    "[ persist_fit ]  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ htpb ]    now , consider @xmath33 , for @xmath88 . according to the collapsed @xmath89 plots of fig .",
    "[ dot_inter_fitting ] , it is notable that @xmath33 looks like a straight line up to near the point where it reaches its maximum value , at the @xmath90 step , with a positive slope @xmath91 @xmath92 . from eqs .",
    "[ assintotic ] and  [ observ_quad2 ] , and fig .",
    "[ dot_inter_fitting ] , assuming @xmath33 scales as @xmath93 is reasonable , at least for @xmath94 .",
    "such proportionality leads us to look for reliable estimates of @xmath6 , and corrections to scaling exponents , for saw ensembles with @xmath0 not too large . to accomplish this aim , diminishing",
    "the influence of the @xmath0-step ensemble on estimates of scaling exponents is necessary . in other words , it is necessary to find a cutoff step @xmath95 , at which @xmath33 begins to be noticeably influenced by the @xmath0-step saw ensemble .",
    "surely , we can neglect steps above @xmath90 .",
    "to seek the @xmath96 step , we use the difference between the ipls of two @xmath0-step ensembles , one that contains @xmath97 , and the other @xmath98 steps , @xmath99 where @xmath100 . according to fig .",
    "[ diff_prod_inter](a ) , the ipl has approximately the same behavior for the two path lengths , up to the middle of the shortest path , @xmath101 , for square lattices .",
    "similarly , for cubic lattices , it has the same behavior , up to a third of the shortest path @xmath102 [ see fig .  [ diff_prod_inter](b ) ] . therefore , using @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 for 2d and 3d lattices , respectively , it is suitable to estimate the scaling exponents through @xmath33 .",
    "[ htpb ]    additional information to do scaling analysis with @xmath33 comes from the expansion of @xmath3 in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found no evidence of the linear term in the expansion of @xmath106 on square or cubic lattices .",
    "the nonexistence of the linear term is also reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . from eq .",
    "[ observ_quad2 ] , the only way to disappear with the linear term in the expansion of @xmath3 is if the summation of @xmath33 cancels it out .",
    "this finding , with eq .",
    "[ assintotic ] , leads us to write @xmath107   , \\label{scaling : sip}%\\ ] ] for @xmath103 , where @xmath108 is a smoothing constant @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath109 just to cancel the linear term . also , we did another ansatz : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this was inspired by results considering only the first non - analytical correction to scaling term , and leaving only the parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath108 free , which lead us to find @xmath114 for the 3d case .",
    "notice that , in general @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; however , for @xmath0 not too large , order of hundreds for 2d and 3d cases , these parameters converged to constants , for @xmath103 .    the ipl data , containing several @xmath0-step ensembles , fitted by eq .",
    "[ scaling : sip ] is depicted in the inset plots of fig .",
    "[ diff_prod_inter ] . for both ,",
    "the 2d and 3d square lattices , the leading and sub - leading exponents are in excellent agreement with the believed results .",
    "for the square lattice , we found @xmath117 , and the non - analytical first exponent results in @xmath63 ; because it does not appear in eq .",
    "[ scaling : sip ] , showing that there exists a constant in the expansion of @xmath3 .",
    "this is confirmed through the expansion of @xmath4 ; the predicted results are @xmath118 and @xmath63 . for cubic lattices we found @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , while the best predicted results are @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "using several @xmath0-step ensembles seeks to reduce the error on exponent estimates ; however , they may carry some small biased errors . to check this , for 2d - saw",
    ", we used @xmath123 steps obtaining @xmath124 , and for 3d - saw we used @xmath125 steps giving @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "however , the errors we get are not as small as those from literature for the 3d case @xcite .",
    "we can improve these results , by taking into account the advantage of the statistical invariance , and calculating the ipl starting from the end of the generated chains , thus doubling the sample .",
    "in fact , it is out of the scope of this paper to find high precision values for the exponents , but to validate and evaluate the benefits of our approach .",
    "moreover , the whole potential of the method to do the scaling analysis of rws has not been fully exploited .",
    "we expect that the corrections to scaling exponents are easily accessible from the study of the monotonically decreasing @xmath33 terms of @xmath3 , which will readily be tackled .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an approach to address the scaling of rw conformational quantities , where the mean square end - to - end distance is proportional to the summation of the inner persistence length , @xmath128 . for rw models , where paths obtained by orthogonal transformations occur with the same probability",
    ", we obtained a novel relation between the mean square end - to - end distance and persistence length . despite the numerical limitations to do scaling analysis",
    ", we introduce a series for the persistence length @xmath4 and show that it converges to a constant , @xmath129 , apart corrections to scaling terms .",
    "we also developed a method to calculate the scaling exponents from @xmath33 with a path cutoff that diminishes the @xmath0-step ensemble influence .",
    "thus , the method is efficient to obtain the scaling behavior of saw .",
    "we conclude that only an ensemble of paths with the same length is sufficient for performing scaling analysis , being that the whole information needed are contained in the inner part of the paths .",
    "the scaling method discussed in this paper can be important for studying universality , criticality , and conformational properties of systems mapped on rw models , such as polymers , biopolymers , and magnetic systems .",
