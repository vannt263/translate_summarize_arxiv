    "the widespread availability of near - infrared ( nir ) panoramic detectors has rendered possible many scientific programs which were unfeasible with single - element photometers .",
    "new and more sophisticated data acquisition and reduction techniques have successfully exploited the capabilities of the new technology while , at the same time , photometric calibration has generally relied on older pre - existing standard networks based on `` one - pixel '' photometry .",
    "such networks include the saao system of glass ( @xcite ) , expanded and rationalized by carter ( @xcite , @xcite ) , comprising probably the most comprehensive and best - observed list available ; the mso system defined by jones & hyland ( @xcite , @xcite ) , now more or less supplanted or absorbed into the aao system ( allen & cragg @xcite ) ; the eso system ( engels @xcite ; bouchet , schmider , & manfroid @xcite ) ; and the system which appears to the greatest extent to have inherited the original mantle of the photometry of h. l. johnson in the 1960s , the cit ( caltech / cerro - tololo ) system of frogel et al .",

    "this last forms the basis of the unpublished , but widely used , hybrid standard star set maintained at the 3.8  m uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "all these comprise relatively bright stars suitable for photometry at small- and medium - sized telescopes with instruments which do not have the limited well capacities of array elements . however , when observed with array detectors even on moderate - sized telescopes , stars with k @xmath6 7.5 produce saturated pixels unless defocussed or observed in non - standard modes with extremely short on - chip integration times , neither of which stratagem is conducive to precise and homogeneous calibration .    the `` ukirt faint standards '' ( casali & ha - warden @xcite ) upon which the calibration of this work is based comprise a new set of much fainter stars chosen and observed at ukirt to facilitate observations with panoramic detectors with limited dynamic range . however , they are relatively few in number and isolated , occur mostly around the celestial equator , and many of the stars are too faint to be useful for small- or medium - sized telescopes . only preliminary results are currently available for the ukirt faint standards , although this situation is actively being remedied by the expansion and reobservation of the list at ukirt .",
    "we present here a set of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 photometric measurements , obtained with the arcetri nicmos3 camera , arnica .",
    "the photometry comprises 86 stars in 40 fields observable from the northern hemisphere .",
    "the selection of the standard fields is described in section  2 , followed by a discussion of observing and data reduction techniques in section  3 .",
    "section 4 presents the photometry and a comparison with other photometric systems .",
    "the sample was designed around the capabilities of the large - format nicmos and insb arrays mounted in cameras at small- to medium - sized telescopes . in particular , stars with relatively faint k magnitudes",
    "were required ( 8.5@xmath6  k  @xmath614.0 ) , with as wide a color range as possible ( -0.2 @xmath6  j ",
    "k  @xmath71.0 ) . moreover ,",
    "the calibrated stars should be situated in relatively uncrowded fields so as to avoid confusion and facilitate field identification . at the same time",
    ", more than one calibrated star should be available in a 2@xmath32  arcmin field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "finally , the range in apparent position was chosen to provide good sky coverage for northern hemisphere sites with latitudes between 35 and 45@xmath8 .    to facilitate initial calibration and minimize the effects of color terms , we selected a set of 15 sao stars with spectral type a0 and v magnitudes of roughly 9 .",
    "these sao stars are distributed uniformly in r.a and about a declination of 40@xmath8 .",
    "the similarity of a - star nir and visual magnitudes makes possible an instantaneous initial rough calibration and provides easy consistency checks .",
    "a stars have the further advantage that they tend not to be variable , and , notwithstanding their relatively faint infrared magnitudes , are easily visible at the telescope .    because we wanted to exploit the two - dimen - sional capability of panoramic detectors , we added to the list fields taken from the ccd standard stars given in christian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these fields comprise a large range in optical magnitude , are minimally crowded , and are observable with a 2@xmath32  arcmin fov .",
    "all of the fields are in the vicinity of star clusters .",
    "stars selected from the ukirt faint standard system ( casali & hawarden @xcite ) were used as primary calibration sources .",
    "we extracted from the ukirt list of faint standards those stars with declinations @xmath9 and with k magnitudes @xmath7 8.5 ; @xmath4 colors for this subset range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the ukirt list comprises optical standards from `` selected areas '' ( landolt @xcite ) , hst calibration objects ( turnshek et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and stars in m67 ( eggen & sandage @xcite ) and in the globular clusters m3 ( ngc5272 ) and m13 ( ngc6205 ) .",
    "stars surrounding the nominal calibration stars in the ukirt fields were used as program objects , and processed in the same way as the a - star and ccd fields mentioned above .",
    "our goal was to calibrate as many stars as possible within the central fov of the camera observations .",
    "many of the central stars proved to be relatively isolated , so that the mean number of stars per field is @xmath122 .",

    "the center of the field was placed in five different positions on the array : the first near the center , and the remaining four in the center of each of the four quadrants . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "sky frames were used as the flat field correction . to account for telescope emissivity at 2@xmath13 m , @xmath2-band observations were instead reduced using differential flat fields , obtained independently .",
    "tests showed that these procedures minimize the residual ( after flat - field correction ) spatial variation in the photometry ( see appendix ) .",
    "all the data reduction was carried out with the arnica data reduction package ( hunt et al .",
    "@xcite ) in the iraf environment .",
    "the images acquired in the first two ( commissioning ) runs  about one - third of the database  showed a residual spatial variation in the photometry that was subsequently rectified by a modification in the camera optics . to correct for this effect in those runs ,",
    "an empirical second - order flat - field correction was applied to each image as described in hunt et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we have checked that this procedure produces no systematic trends relative to the later data .",
    "virtual aperture photometry was performed for each of the different positions separately .",
    "the technique of moving the telescope to place the star in different positions on the array implies that five measurements are available for the central stars , but that field stars may have fewer measurements because they may fall outside the array . note that we used relatively large apertures in order to encompass possible faint stars within 10arcsec of the program stars .",
    "images with discrepant values for the photometry were checked to evaluate effects of any bad pixels , and these were either corrected , when possible , or eliminated from further consideration .",
    "observations of the ukirt faint standards throughout the night were used to determine the nightly `` zero point '' ( zp ) for each band . from five to eight stars from the ukirt faint standard list were observed each night together with the program stars .",
    "most of the program star observations were obtained at 1.6 airmasses or less , and every attempt was made to observe the calibrating stars over the same range in airmass as the program stars .",
    "atmospheric extinction was corrected for by fitting simultaneously , for each band for each run , an extinction coefficient common to all nights and a zp that varied from night to night .",
    "typical extinction coefficients are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 mag / airmass at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .    in total",
    ", we calibrated 86 stars in 40 fields in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 filters ; the photometry is reported in table  [ table : dat ] .",
    "the final values for the photometry of the program stars were determined by combining , in a weighted average , all the measurements , corrected for extinction , from the different nights of observation .",
    "the errors given in table [ table : dat ] are the errors on the mean .",
    "the exact prescription for these calculations is given in the appendix .",
    "for a few stars ( e.g. , as16 - 1 , as39 - 1 ) , the errors in one band are much smaller than the errors in the remaining bands ; these small errors probably result from an observed scatter which is fortuitously small , and thus the larger errors in the remaining bands may be a more realistic estimate of the quality .",
    "we note that the colors in the table are merely the differences of the mean magnitudes , as we determined the photometry in each filter band separately , instead of giving precedence to one band and determining mean colors .",
    "the final database contains 6551 photometric measurements from 3899 reduced images . on average ,",
    "stars have been observed on 26.0 times per filter on 5.5 different nights , but a few have been observed on only three nights ( see table [ table : dat ] ) , and these should probably be used with more discretion than the rest . the median ( mean ) error in the photometry in table  [ table : dat ] is 0012 ( 0013 ) , 0011 ( 0012 ) , and 0011 ( 0012 ) , in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "no photometric value in the table has a formal error @xmath170028 , and standard deviations of the ensemble of values used to calculate the photometry are always @xmath18005 .",
    "figure [ fig : stats ] illustrates this quality assessment . for a given star , the measurements taken in the same night are not considered as statistically independent values , since they were calibrated with the same zp and , in a given five - position set , reduced with inter - dependent sky frames .",
    "we note that the filling factor of the nicmos3 array is roughly 95% .",
    "the projected pixel dimension at all telescopes was typically half the typical seeing width , so that the mean photometric error due to an incompletely filled array element is @xmath60.1% ( mccaughrean @xcite ) , and should be negligible relative to the other sources of scatter .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 colors for the stars listed in table  [ table : dat ] are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : color ] .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the stars in our data set span a wide range in spectral type , notwithstanding the initial selection of a preponderance of a stars .",
    "the @xmath4 color ranges from @xmath10 to @xmath21 , making possible accurate evaluations of color transformations between this photometry and other work .",
    "we have checked for correlations of reported errors with @xmath4 color or magnitude , and find no trend with color .",
    "the only ( very weak ) correlation is with @xmath2-band errors and @xmath2 magnitude , such that errors are larger for fainter stars .",
    "this is not unexpected behavior , since the faintest stars suffer the most from the large @xmath2-band background ( typically 1212.5magarcsec@xmath22 ) , and the consequent uncertainty in its subtraction .",
    "altough our data are well - suited to searches for variability , given the long month / years timescales spanned by our observations , we found no convincing evidence for variation .",
    "nevertheless , a more definitive statement awaits long - term monitoring , in particular , of the reddest stars .      of the 86 stars in table [ table : dat ] , 22 are",
    "ukirt faint standards ( denoted as `` fs '' in the table ) , and were used to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the residuals for these stars were defined , similarly to the magnitudes of the program stars , as the mean difference , over all the nights of observation , between the nightly zp and the zp of the star itself .",
    "their magnitudes , in the system described here , were determined from the sum of the nominal ukirt magnitudes and the mean residuals .",
    "the mean residuals of the ukirt faint standards ( omitting fs  14 , see below ) are 0.001 , -0.0004 , and -0.004 in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively , and with rms differences of 0.012 , 0.013 , and 0.019 .",
    "we therefore measure no significant offset between the arnica photometry reported here , and the ukirt system from which it was derived .    of the 22 ukirt faint standards , three stars ,",
    "fs  14 , fs  21 , and fs  33 , have significant non - zero residuals relative to the published ukirt photometry ( casali & hawarden @xcite ) . the star with the largest residual ( @xmath23=-0061 with s / n=2.5 ) , fs  14 , is also the faintest star used as a calibrator .",
    "hence , it was subsequently treated as a program object and removed from the list of calibrators ; for all of the nights in which it was observed , the nightly calibration was redone , and the photometry recalibrated .",
    "we have attempted to derive a color transformation equation between the photometry published here and the original ukirt system .",
    "( a transformation equation between ukirt and cit has been published in casali & hawarden ( @xcite ) . )",
    "the arnica @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band residuals ( in the sense arnica@xmath24ukirt ) for the ukirt calibrator stars and ukirt @xmath4 color were fit with weighted regressions .",
    "( fs  14 was omitted from this operation . )",
    "the only ( possibly ) significant non - zero slope is for @xmath0 with @xmath25 ; this regression is shown as a dashed line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] .",
    "although the arnica @xmath0 filter may be slightly redder than the ukirt one , as suggested by the above equation , the data used to determine the regression are not suited to this kind of analysis .",
    "the color excursion of the ukirt fs s is limited ( @xmath26 ) , and there is a trend between color and magnitude such that the bluest stars are also the faintest , and thus subject to the largest uncertainty .",
    "we caution , therefore , that these values for a @xmath0-band color transformation should be considered as very preliminary .",
    "we have presented new nir photometry for 86 stars in 40 fields .",
    "the sky coverage is relatively uniform , and ideal for observatories with @xmath27 . on average ,",
    "stars have been observed on more than five different nights , and typical errors on the photometry are 0012 .",
    "we find some indication of a color transformation between the arnica ( nicmos ) photometry reported here and the original ukirt ( insb ) system , but a definitive statement awaits a larger data set designed specifically to determine such a transformation .",
    "the staffs of the tirgo , the not , and the vatt helped make these observations possible .",
    "we are grateful to colin aspin , mark casali , and tim hawarden for insightful comments and useful advice ; to prof .",
    "gianni tofani for his generosity in funding the expenses of publication ; and to an anonymous referee for helpful criticism and comments on an earlier version of this paper .",
    "there are two main sources of error or uncertainty in our data : residual spatial variation in the photometry ( that is to say after the flat - field correction ) , and variation in the atmospheric transparency . in order for our error estimate to be reliable",
    ", we must be able to separate these effects , and realistically assess their impact .",
    "we note that residual spatial variation is observed only with the optics used at the tirgo .",
    "the largest - amplitude effect was observed in the commissioning runs ( 1992 - 93 ) , and was corrected for by an empirically - determined flat field mentioned in the main text , and described in detail in hunt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the tirgo optical train was then modified , and typical subsequent runs at tirgo are characterized by roughly 0.05  mag scatter , a value which comprises both atmospheric and spatial variation",
    ". runs at the vatt and the not do not show measurable spatial variation in the photometry .",
    "we describe here how the individual measurements were combined into the final mean magnitudes reported in table [ table : dat ] .",
    "the nightly magnitudes for each star and their associated errors are described first , followed by the description of the final averages . as noted in the main text , in each filter ,",
    "a single observation consists of at least five frames ( `` measurements '' ) with the star placed in different positions on the array . in what follows",
    ", @xmath28 will be used to denote exclusively the standard deviation of a given ensemble .",
    "the _ errors _ we associate with a given value will be denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "first , the variation in the atmospheric transparency @xmath30 for each night was determined by the global fit , over an entire run , of the extinction coefficients and nightly zero points ( zp ) at unit air mass .",
    "the photometry used for this fit was averaged over position , and thus , as long as this averaging procedure is free of systematics , should be independent of spatial variation .",
    "the fit gives nightly zp s with formal errors , and these last define @xmath30 .",
    "the residual spatial variation in the photometry was managed by using , when possible , positional zp s ( @xmath31 ) to separately calibrate the program star measurements at each position .",
    "such a procedure does not change the nightly mean , but reduces the impact of any spatial variation in the photometry , which is at least partially compensated by the equivalent spatial variation in the calibrator .",
    "if on a given night @xmath32 we have @xmath33 measurements @xmath34 of a given star , then we can define @xmath35 , where subscript @xmath36 indicates the position on the array .",
    "the nightly mean magnitude @xmath37 was determined by a simple average over the @xmath33 measurements @xmath38 .",
    "typically , @xmath33 is 5 for central stars , and less for field stars sufficiently distant from the central one .",
    "the variance on the ensemble @xmath38 due to any residual spatial variation can be written as : @xmath39 where we have defined @xmath40 ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spatial variances of the @xmath43 and @xmath31 , respectively , and @xmath44 is the covariance of the @xmath43 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the photometry varies spatially , then @xmath43 and @xmath31 are anti - correlated , and the covariance term _ reduces _ @xmath45 accordingly . if the use of positionally - dependent zp s is not possible ( for example in the case of the field stars ) , then @xmath46 takes into account the increased scatter introduced by any spatial variation .",
    "the final nightly error @xmath47 associated with @xmath37 was defined as the quadrature sum of the transparency variation @xmath30 , the uncertainty on the zp given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of calibrators observed on the @xmath50 night , and the residual spatial variation ( error on the mean ) : @xmath51    the global mean of a given star reported in table [ table : dat ] is simply the weighted average @xmath52 of @xmath37 over all the nights of observations , where the weights are given by @xmath53 .",
    "the error @xmath29 we associate with the final photometry is the error of the mean , defined relative to the weighted average ( as opposed to the simple average which would minimize , by definition , the scatter ) .",
