    "a comprehensive understanding of superdeformed  ( sd ) bands requires knowledge of the quantum numbers ( spin and parity ) and excitation energies of the levels in the second well .",
    "in particular , these quantities allow for stringent tests of configuration assignments and , more importantly , of the ability of theory to calculate shell - correction energies at large deformation .",
    "however , although more than 250 sd bands are known in the a=150 and 190 regions@xcite , only a few sd bands in @xmath2hg@xcite , @xmath2pb@xcite , @xmath3pb@xcite and in @xmath4dy@xcite , have the spins and excitation energies determined through one - step linking transitions .",
    "the yrast sd band in @xmath0hg was the first one to be discovered in the @xmath5 region  @xcite .",
    "it is especially interesting to obtain the spins and excitation energies for an odd - a sd band which , combined with data on neighboring even - even nuclei , can give information on the relative pair correlation energies in normal - deformed ( nd ) and superdeformed ( sd ) states . so far , the main information on single - particle configurations has come from detailed analyses of the @xmath6 dynamic moments of inertia of the sd bands . with a knowledge of the level energies and the associated quantum numbers ,",
    "calculations can be put to more extensive tests and information can be obtained on properties such as particle alignment .    the work of vigezzi _ _ et al.__@xcite and recent improvements by refs .",
    "@xcite laid the theoretical foundation for treating the coupling of an isolated , cold sd state with a high - density of hot compound nd states , which forms the basis of the decay mechanism .",
    "the decay of sd bands happens suddenly , typically out of one to two sd states in the mass 190 region .",
    "one possible mechanism responsible for this sudden decay out of the sd band , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is chaos - assisted tunneling .",
    "when the sd band decays , most of the strength is fragmented over numerous pathways , thus forming a quasi - continuum spectrum  @xcite with sharp lines at high energy , which are due to direct decay to low - lying discrete nd levels .",
    "the decay spectrum from sd states is similar@xcite to the spectrum following the decay of neutron - capture states@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the decay originates from a discrete point in excitation energy and spin and proceeds to a multitude of final states .",
    "one way of determining the spins and excitation energies of sd bands is to analyze the quasi - continuum decay spectrum connecting sd and nd states .",
    "the technique to extract the quasi - continuum decay spectrum was pioneered on @xmath3hg in the work of henry _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "an improved method is described in detail by lauritsen _ _ et al.__@xcite and is the one used in this paper .",
    "the method has been successfully tested in the case of sd band 1 in @xmath2hg@xcite , where it determined the same spins and excitation energies as those known from several one - step @xmath1-ray transitions connecting the sd band to known nd states@xcite .",
    "the results from the quasi - continuum analysis are an important complement in cases where only one or two decay pathways are known . however , in most instances , one - step transitions are not observed , and it is then the only available option .    in this work the quasi - continuum spectrum following the decay of the yrast sd band in @xmath0hg has been extracted . from this spectrum ,",
    "we determine the excitation energy and spin of the sd band and also derive information on pairing in normal - deformed states .",
    "we also present two 1-step decay pathways , which directly connect the yrast sd band in @xmath0hg with known yrast levels in the nd level scheme .",
    "it will be shown that the results from the two methods agree very well and , thus , we can make a confident assignment of the spin and excitation energy of the yrast sd band in @xmath0hg .",
    "the experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with several skyrme interactions .",
    "we shall also extract and discuss information on pairing in sd states , by comparing the present results with those from the even - even hg nuclei .",
    "superdeformed states in @xmath0hg were populated using the @xmath7yb(@xmath8ne,5n)@xmath0hg reaction .",
    "the experiment was performed with the gammasphere array@xcite , which had 96 compton - suppressed ge detectors at the time of the experiment . the 120  mev @xmath8ne beam",
    "was provided by the 88  cyclotron at lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "the 3.1  mg/@xmath9 @xmath7yb target had a 6.8  mg/@xmath9 @xmath10au backing to stop the recoiling nuclei .",
    "the decay - out @xmath1 rays were emitted after the recoils came to rest in the backing , so that the transitions will correspond to sharp lines rather than doppler broadened ones .",
    "a total of @xmath11 x @xmath12 triple- or higher - fold coincidence events were collected .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrum , obtained with pairwise coincidence gates on sd transitions , is shown in fig .  [",

    "the lower panel presents the high - energy part of the spectrum , in particular , the two transitions at 2778 and 3310  kev , which will be shown to connect sd and known nd states@xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : link - sd ] gives the coincidence spectra gated on a sd line and either the 2778-kev ( upper figure ) or 3310-kev ( lower figure ) transition . even though the statistics are low , the intensities of the nd lines suggest that the 2778-kev transition feeds the known nd 35/2@xmath14 yrast level at 3222  kev .",

    "we rule out the possibility of it being a stretched e2 transition , because that would require m3 multipolarity for the 3310-kev one - step transition .",

    "the experimental data do not allow for a parity assignment .",

    "[ fig : level ] shows the levels fed in the decay of the sd band .",
    "the energy of the 13/2@xmath21 state is set at zero to facilitate the comparison of the experimental and theoretical sd excitation energies and to circumvent the 22-kev uncertainity in its excitation energy  @xcite .",

    "a method has been developed at argonne@xcite to isolate the quasi - continuum @xmath1-ray spectrum connecting the sd and nd states . to confirm the results from the one - step linking transitions , this method , which is described in detail in ref.@xcite , was followed here .",
    "first , the data were sorted with double coincidence gates on sd transitions to obtain clean spectra . only double gates which produce clean sd spectra , without significant contamination by nd transitions ,",

    "the area of the spectrum was then normalized to multiplicity by requiring that the sum of the intensities of transitions feeding the ground state is 1 .",
    "the 390  kev line is a doublet composed of a sd transition and a transition feeding the nd ground state .",
