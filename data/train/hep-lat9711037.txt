    "to study more preciesely the glueball properties , one should compute not only the spectroscopy , but also the wave functions .",
    "once the wave functions are available , the matrix elements relevant for the glueball production and decays ( branch ratios ) become calculable . in some sence , the wave functions @xcite can give more physical information than the masses themselves . in this paper , we present a method for such a purpose .    we begin with the vacuum wave function in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 consists of wilson loops ( clusters ) @xcite , and the state @xmath2 is defined by @xmath3 . for the glueballs ,",
    "we consider here only the anti - symmetric ( under a plane parity transformation ) lowest lying excited state , and take the wave function as @xmath4 where @xmath5 contains various wilson loops with the appropriate symmetry .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that we can establish a truncation scheme , which preserves the continuum limit , where the operators r and @xmath6 are expanded in order of graphs ( clusters ) : @xmath7 here @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) is the lowest order term in @xmath10 ( or @xmath6 ) , and is chosen to be @xmath11 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 .",

    "higher order clusters can be produced by solving the eigenvalue equations @xcite for @xmath15 and @xmath16 order by order , from which we obtain @xmath17 here the repeated index j implies a summation over all the clusters up to some n - th order . in previous papers @xcite , we have shown that this method is very efficient in obtaining scaling behavior of physical quantities .",
    "first results @xcite for the glueball masses in qcd have been obtained from this method .",
    "in order to obtain the correlation of the states , we first investigate the continuum limit of the clusters . expanding @xmath18 ( plaquette ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 in order of the lattice spacing @xmath21",

    ", we consider here a 2 + 1 dimensional u(1 ) model .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the theory is confining for all non - vanishing coupling constant .",
    "when @xmath21 goes to zero , the glueball mass @xmath42 is expected to decrease exponentially as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some constants .",

    "@xmath50 @xmath51 in the continuum limit , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 should be constants , which means the curves of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ...... against @xmath61 will be straight line with the expected slope in the scaling region .    in figs . 1 and 2 , we present the results for @xmath59 and @xmath60 against @xmath62 from the 2nd to 5th order . in fig .",
    "3 , we also show the result for @xmath63 from the 2nd order through 4th order against @xmath61 .",
    "all the curves show a nice exponential behavior and a clear trend towards convergence .",
    "in particular , the slope of @xmath64 is well consistent with the spectrum . for @xmath60,@xmath63 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ", we expect that when the order increases , their slopes would approach their correct theoretical values .    in conclusion ,",
    "the method described above has proved to be very useful for calculating the vacuum and glueball wave functions and correlation lengths .",
