    "the israeli electrostatic accelerator fel ( ea - fel ) is based on a 6  mev en - tandem van de graaff accelerator , which was originally used as an ion accelerator for nuclear physics experiments @xcite .",
    "the scheme employs straight geometry for the electron beam transport , where the electron gun and the collector are installed outside of the accelerator region .",
    "lasing was reported in a previous configuration , where radiation was transmitted through the accelerator tubes with 40db attenuation @xcite .    in the present version of the fel , which was relocated to ariel",
    ", the millimeter - wave radiation generated in the resonator is separated from the electron beam by means of a perforated talbot effect reflector @xcite .",
    "a quasi - optic delivery system transmits the out - coupled power through a window in the pressurized gas accelerator tank .",
    "the basic parameters of the fel are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the acceleration voltage is set to be @xmath0 in order to tune the frequency of the fel radiation to the w - band near 100  ghz .    in the following sections , we present an analysis and the results of spontaneous and stimulated emissions measurements carried out recently .",

    "random electron distribution in the e - beam causes fluctuations in current density , identified as _ shot noise _ in the beam current .",
    "electrons passing through a magnetic undulator emit a partially coherent radiation , which is called _ undulator synchrotron radiation_. the electromagnetic fields excited by each electron add incoherently , resulting in a _ spontaneous emission _ with generated power spectral density @xcite :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the _ expected value _ of the spontaneous emission power , @xmath13 is the slippage time and @xmath14 is the detuning parameter ( @xmath15 is the axial velocity of the accelerated electrons and @xmath16 is the group velocity of the generated radiation ) .",
    "the spontaneous emission null - to - null bandwidth is approximately @xmath17 . in a fel , utilizing a magneto - static planar wiggler , the total power of the spontaneous emission is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mode impedance , and @xmath20 is the dc beam current .",
    "the expected value of the total spontaneous emission power generated inside the cavity is about @xmath21 .",
    "the calculated spectrum of the spontaneous emission power of the israeli ea - fel , has a null - to - null bandwidth of 18  ghz .    at the resonator output , the spontaneous emission spectrum generated inside the resonator",
    "is modified by a fabry - perot spectral transfer - function @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath8 is the resonator ( round - trip ) length , @xmath10 is the total power reflectivity of the cavity , @xmath9 is the power transmission of the out - coupler and @xmath23 is the axial wavenumber of the waveguide mode .",
    "the maxima of the resonator transfer function factor occur when @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is an integer ) , which defines the resonant frequencies @xmath26 of the longitudinal modes .",
    "the _ free - spectral range _",
    "( fsr ) ( the inter - mode frequency separation ) is given by @xmath27  mhz .",
    "the transmission peak is @xmath28 with _ full - width half - maximum _ ( fwhm ) bandwidth of @xmath29  mhz , where @xmath30{r}/(1 - \\sqrt{r})=14.56 $ ] is the _ finesse _ of the resonator .",
    "the spectral line - shape of the spontaneous emission power obtained at the resonator output of the ea - fel is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the _ noise equivalent bandwidth _ is defined as the bandwidth of an ideal band - pass filter producing the same noise power at its output .",
    "the noise equivalent bandwidth of a single resonant longitudinal mode is @xmath31  mhz .",
    "consequently , the spontaneous emission power of mode @xmath25 is given by : @xmath32 the typical bandwidth of the generated spontaneous emission power spectrum ( 1 ) is @xmath33  ghz .",
    "the number of longitudinal modes within the spontaneous emission bandwidth is then @xmath34 .",
    "thus the total spontaneous emission power measured at the output of the resonator is given as follows : @xmath35    using equation ( 2 ) , we expect up to @xmath36 spontaneous emission power to be generated inside the resonator . from ( 5 ) , the power emitted from the resonator out - coupler is reduced to @xmath37 .",
    "the attenuation of the wave - guiding system , delivering the power from the resonator , located inside the high - voltage terminal , to the measurement apparatus is 10db .",
    "consequently , the spontaneous emission power expected at the detector sight is 2.4  @xmath38w .",
    "the traces shown in fig .  2 , describe the electron beam current pulse and the signal obtained at the detector video output , corresponding to the measured spontaneous emission rf power .",
    "in the present operation regime of the fel , the efficiency of energy extraction from the electron beam is given in terms of the number of wiggler s periods @xmath39 by the approximate formula @xmath40  % .",
    "the stimulated radiation power generated inside the resonator at steady state is given as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42  kw for a beam current of @xmath43  a. the resulted power obtained from the out - coupler is given as follows : @xmath44 and evaluated to be @xmath45  kw . considering the attenuation of the transmission system , 700  w is expected at the detector .",
    "3 shows recent measurement of 150  w radiation power at the end of the optical transmission line in the measurement room .",
    "we note that in the present preliminary experiments , only a fraction of the cathode current was transported through the wiggler , and no beam circulation ( transport up to the collector ) was achieved .",
    "the charging of the terminal caused voltage drop of the terminal of 125  kv during the pulse duration .",
    "evidently , the fel had not yet reached saturation because the radiation mode built inside the resonator went out of synchronism with the beam before reaching saturation .",
