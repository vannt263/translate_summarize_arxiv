    "nuclear matter is defined as an uniform system of interacting nucleons ( we will consider equal number of neutrons and protons ) without electromagnetic interactions .",
    "this is a good approximation for the conditions in the interior of a heavy nucleus .",
    "the nuclear matter is characterized by its saturation density ( @xmath1 ) and energy per nucleon ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "a central problem in nuclear many - body theory is the calculation of properties of nuclear matter using realistic models of nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "recently , several realistic potentials are constructed which accurately fit the proton - proton and neutron - proton scattering phase shifts .",
    "these potentials contain terms which break charge independence @xcite .",
    "charge independence breaking of the nucleon - nucleon interaction means that , in the isospin @xmath3 state , the proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) , neutron - proton ( @xmath5 ) , or neutron - neutron ( @xmath6 ) interactions are different , after electromagnetic effects have been removed .",
    "this is well established in the @xmath0 state for the scattering lenghts , @xmath7 , and effective ranges , @xmath8 , @xcite , @xmath9 the charge dependence of nucleon - nucleon interaction can also be inferred from binding energy differences of the mirror nuclei @xcite .",
    "the major cause of charge independence breaking in the nucleon - nucleon interaction is the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions @xcite , @xmath10 the charge dependence of nucleon - nucleon interaction due to the pion mass difference has been calculated in references @xcite .",
    "whitin qcd , the charge independence breaking of nucleon - nucleon interaction is of course due to the differences in the up and down quarks masses and charges @xcite .",
    "the aim of present work is the investigation of the effects of charge independence breaking of nucleon - nucleon interaction on the properties of nuclear matter by employing the _ reid-93 _ potential @xcite in our calculations .",
    "for the _ reid-93 _ potential , the proton - proton ( _ pp _ ) , neutron - neutron ( _ nn _ ) , and neutron - proton ( _ np _ ) interactions are different .",
    "therefore , this potential depends on @xmath11 .",
    "this shows that in our calculations , we should consider explicitly the isospin projection @xmath11 .",
    "the procedure of the method used in our calculations is fully discussed in references @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we present the results of our calculations for the various properties of nuclear matter with inclusion of charge dependence in the nucleon - nucleon interaction and then , we investigate the charge independence breaking effects on our results . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the _ reid-93 _ potential in our nuclear matter calculations in two different cases as below .    1 .",
    "charge dependent case ( cd-_reid-93 _ ) : + we distinguish between the _ pp _ , _ nn _ , and _ np _ interactions @xcite .",
    "2 .   charge independent case ( ci-_reid-93 _ ) : + we replace the _",
    "pp _ and _ nn _ interactions by the corresponding _ np _ interaction @xcite .",
    "this means that we identify the nucleon - nucleon interactions with the _ np _ interaction and therefore , the charge dependence is removed .",
    "then , we compare the results of these cases .    our results for the total energy of nuclear matter as a function of density with the cd-_reid-93 _",
    "( charge dependent case ) and ci-_reid-93 _ ( charge independent case ) potentials are given in figure 1 .",
    "it is seen that the inclusion of charge dependence in the nucleon - nucleon interaction changes the total energy of nuclear matter , especially at high densities . at low densities ( @xmath12 ) , this effect is small . in order to clarify how the charge independence breaking ( cib ) of nucleon - nucleon interaction affects the total energy of nuclear matter , we calculate the difference between our results for the charge dependent ( cd ) and charge independent ( ci ) cases , @xmath13 these results are presented in table 1 .",
    "we see that the change of total energy of nuclear matter due to the breaking of the charge independence increases by increasing density . in figure 1 , the results of ehmmp calculations with the _ reid-93 _",
    "potential @xcite are also given for comparison .",
    "there is a good agreement between our results and those of ehmmp @xcite , especially at high densities .    in table 2 ,",
    "the results of our calculations for the saturation density @xmath14 , energy @xmath15 , and incompressibility @xmath16 of nuclear matter in the charge dependent case are compared with those of charge independent case and also with the results of ehmmp @xcite and mpm @xcite .",
    "we see that for the saturation properies of nuclear matter , the inclusion of charge dependence is a small effect .",
    "we also see that our results agree with the results of others .    we know that the contribution of one - body energy to the total energy of nuclear matter is indpendent of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "therefore , we investigate the effects of charge independence breaking on the contribution of the potential energy of various channels to the total energy . the contribution of the @xmath17 and @xmath0 channels to the potential energy are plotted versus density in figures 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath17 energy contribution in both cases of charge dependent and charge independent are identical .",
    "however , a significant difference is seen for the energy contribution of the @xmath0 channel in those cases .",
    "this difference increases by increasing density .",
    "it is also seen that the change of the energy of @xmath0 channel due to the inclusion of charge dependence is repulsive .",
    "this shows that in the channel with isospin @xmath3 , the _ np _ interaction is more attractive than the corresponding _ pp _ and _ nn _ interactions .",
    "the total potential energy of nuclear matter in the charge dependent and charge independent cases are shown in figure 4 . we see that at high densities , the charge independence breaking of nucleon - nucleon interaction affects the potential energy of nuclear matter .",
    "but , at low densities , this effect is negligible .",
    "the results of ehmmp with the _ reid-93 _",
    "potential @xcite are also shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is seen that our results are in a good agreement with those of ehmmp @xcite .",
    "the equation of state of nuclear matter is one of the most importance in astrophysics and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our results for the equation of state of nuclear matter are given in figure 5 .",
    "it can be seen that the results of charge dependent and charge independent cases are nearly identical .",
    "the calculation of properties of nuclear matter using a realistic nucleon - nucleon potential contained the charge dependence is of special interest in the nuclear many - body theory . in this article",
    ", we have calculated the various properties of nuclear matter such as the energy , saturation properties , and equation of state using the charge dependent _",
    "reid-93 _ potential . at high densities , a significant difference between our results for the energy of nuclear matter in the case of employing charge",
    "dependent nucleon - nucleon interaction and those of charge independent nucleon - nucleon interaction was observed .",
    "however , at low densities , this difference is small .",
    "this indicates that at high densities , the effects of charge independence breaking of nucleon - nucleon interaction on the properties of nuclear matter are considerable .",
    "it was seen that the energy contribution of the @xmath0 channel is considerably varied by inclusion of charge dependence in the nucleon - nucleon interaction , especially at high densities .",
    "it was shown that the change in the equation of state of nuclear matter due to the charge independence breaking is negligible . finally , the agreement between our results and those of others was shown .",
