    "<S> are : is there an invariant srb - probability measure ? how quickly do correlations between observables decay under iteration by  @xmath1 ? does a central limit theorem hold ? </S>",
    "<S> are these properties stable to perturbations of @xmath1 ? when @xmath1 is _ uniformly expanding _ the answers to these questions are well understood ( see eg  @xcite ) , but the situation for non - uniformly expanding @xmath1 is more delicate . </S>",
    "<S> difficulties arise from the fact that orbits of @xmath1 may experience periods of local contraction as well as expansion ( for example , quadratic maps  @xcite ) , rapidly varying derivatives near singularities leading to unbounded distortion ( eg  @xcite ) , or indifferent fixed points  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory of _ hyperbolic times _ has proved useful for analysing the statistical properties of non - uniformly expanding maps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea was introduced in  @xcite to handle specific non - uniformly expanding families ( alves - viana maps  @xcite and certain quadratic maps  @xcite ) , and has since been developed for various non - uniformly expanding and partially hyperbolic classes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gouzel  @xcite has used hyperbolic times to show that the alves - viana maps exhibit stretched exponential decay of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> alves , luzzatto and pinheiro  @xcite prove exponential decay of correlations ( and a clt ) for a class of non - uniformly expanding maps by using hyperbolic times and a young  tower construction . </S>",
    "<S> further results are obtained in  @xcite for one - dimensional families . </S>",
    "<S> a survey paper discussing many of these ideas is found in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , hyperbolic times are defined as follows ) in section [ sec.2 ] . ] : given an orbit @xmath2 of a point @xmath3 , an integer @xmath4 is a _ hyperbolic time _ for @xmath5 if for all @xmath6 the cumulative derivative @xmath7 grows exponentially in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if the map has a nonempty set @xmath9 of singular points we require the distance from @xmath10 to @xmath9 to contract at exponential rate in @xmath8 , essentially an exponential escape condition . </S>",
    "<S> these exponential rates are to be chosen uniformly for @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for uniformly expanding maps with bounded distortion both conditions automatically hold and every @xmath12 is a hyperbolic time .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the idea is to choose certain times at which the accumulated expansion and escape from the singular set mimic the uniformly expanding case even though there may have been times along the way where these properties failed . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , many good statistical properties can be recovered .    </S>",
    "<S> there are at least two important statistics associated with hyperbolic times : their long - run frequency of occurrence , and the distribution of _ first hyperbolic times_. obtaining precise quantitative control of the distribution of hyperbolic times can be an important step  @xcite in further analysis of statistical properties of the map , including the above - mentioned rates of decay of correlation and clt .    </S>",
    "<S> in  @xcite a map  @xmath13 on the interval @xmath14 $ ] is introduced that has positive density of hyperbolic times , but for which the first hyperbolic time fails to be integrable . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 has a number of special properties ( symmetry , preservation of lebesgue measure , and a pair of indifferent fixed points with quadratic tangencies ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a class of interval maps  @xmath15 ( parametrised by$ ] . ] </S>",

    "<S> each map in @xmath15 has an indifferent fixed point ( ifp ) at @xmath17 , and in fact the map @xmath13 in @xcite is conjugate to a certain map @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath19 has a positive long - run frequency of hyperbolic times ( by an argument from  @xcite ) , and integrability of first hyperbolic times holds when @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath21 increases through  @xmath22 this integrability is lost ( lemma  [ prop : htimelower ] ) . in this way , @xmath23 appears as a transition point for our families @xmath24 .    as becomes clear in our proof of lemma [ prop : htimelower ] , the non - integrability is entirely due to lower bounds on the first hyperbolic time which are determined by escape statistics from the neighbourhood of the ifp(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> these same escape statistics are then used to provide upper bounds on the first hyperbolic times in theorem [ th : hintclt ] , completing the analysis and providing sharp estimate on tail asymptotics for hyperbolic times for the range @xmath25 . while precise statements are given below , roughly speaking : if @xmath26 denotes lebesgue measure and @xmath27 denotes the first hyperbolic time on an orbit beginning at  @xmath5 then @xmath28 .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> hyperbolic times asymptotics are used to estimate correlation decay rates and to establish clt s for nonuniformly hyperbolic systems . when applied to our family @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> , these results imply upper bounds on correlation decay rates that fail to be sharp , compared to the direct computation via young towers detailed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the range of parameters in our family leading to a clt is similarly underestimated by the hyperbolic times analysis . </S>",
