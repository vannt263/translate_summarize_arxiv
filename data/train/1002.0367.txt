    "there is a widespread belief that continuous and pervasive monitoring will be possible in the near future with large numbers of networked , mobile , and wireless sensors .",
    "thus , we are witnessing an intense research activity that focuses on the design of efficient control mechanisms for these systems .",
    "in particular , decentralized algorithms would allow sensor networks to react autonomously to changes in the environment with minimal human supervision .",
    "a substantial body of research on sensor networks has concentrated on simple sensors that can collect scalar data ; e.g. ,  temperature , humidity or pressure data . here",
    ", a main objective is the design of algorithms that can lead to optimal collective sensing through efficient motion control and communication schemes .",
    "however , scalar measurements can be insufficient in many situations ; e.g. ,  in automated surveillance or traffic monitoring applications .",
    "in contrast , data - intensive sensors such as cameras can collect visual data that are rich in information , thus having tremendous potential for monitoring applications , but at the cost of a higher processing overhead .",
    "precisely , this paper aims to solve a coverage optimization problem taking into account part of the sensing / processing trade - off .",
    "coverage optimization problems have mainly been formulated as cooperative problems where each sensor benefits from sensing the environment as a member of a group . however , sensing may also require expenditure ; e.g. ,  the energy consumed or the time spent by image processing algorithms in visual networks .",
    "because of this , we endow each sensor with a utility function that quantifies this trade - off , formulating a coverage problem as a variation of congestion games in  @xcite .",
    "_ literature review .",
    "_ in broad terms , the problem studied here is related to a bevy of sensor location and planning problems in the computational geometry , geometric optimization , and robotics literature .",
    "for example , different variations on the ( combinatorial ) art gallery problem include  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the objective here is how to find the optimum number of guards in a non - convex environment so that each point is visible from at least one guard .",
    "a related set of references for the deployment of mobile robots with omnidirectional cameras includes  @xcite@xcite . unlike the art gallery",
    "classic algorithms , the latter papers assume that robots have local knowledge of the environment and no recollection of the past .",
    "other related references on robot deployment in convex environments include  @xcite@xcite for anisotropic and circular footprints .",
    "the paper  @xcite is an excellent survey on multimedia sensor networks where the state of the art in algorithms , protocols , and hardware is surveyed , and open research issues are discussed in detail . as observed in  @xcite , multimedia sensor networks enhance traditional surveillance systems by enlarging , enhancing , and enabling multi - resolution views .",
    "the investigation of coverage problems for static visual sensor networks is conducted in  @xcite@xcite .",
    "another set of relevant references to this paper comprise those on the use of game - theoretic tools to ( i ) solve static target assignment problems , and ( ii ) devise efficient and secure algorithms for communication networks . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors present a game - theoretic analysis of a coverage optimization problem for static sensor networks .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the weapon - target assignment problem in  @xcite which is nondeterministic polynomial - time complete . in general , the solution to assignment problems is hard from a combinatorial optimization viewpoint .",
    "game theory and learning in games are used to analyze a variety of fundamental problems in ; e.g. ,  wireless communication networks and the internet .",
    "an incomplete list of references includes  @xcite on power control ,  @xcite on routing , and  @xcite on flow control .",
    "however , there has been limited research on how to employ learning in games to develop distributed algorithms for mobile sensor networks .",
    "one exception is the paper  @xcite where the authors establish a link between cooperative control problems ( in particular , consensus problems ) , and games ( in particular , potential games and weakly acyclic games ) .",
    "_ statement of contributions .",
    "_ the contributions of this paper pertain to both coverage optimization problems and learning in games .",
    "compared with  @xcite and  @xcite , this paper employs a more accurate sensing model and the results can be easily extended to include non - convex environments .",
    "contrary to  @xcite , we do not consider energy expenditure from sensor motions .",
    "regarding learning in games , we extend the use of the payoff - based learning dynamics in  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the coverage game we consider here is shown to be a ( constrained ) potential game . a number of learning rules ; e.g. ,  better ( or best ) reply dynamics and adaptive play , have been proposed to reach nash equilibria in potential games . in these algorithms ,",
    "each player must have access to the utility values induced by alternative actions . in our problem",
    "set - up ; however , this information is unaccessible because of the information constraints caused by unknown rewards , motion and sensing limitations . to tackle this challenge",
    ", we develop two distributed payoff - based learning algorithms where each sensor only remembers its own utility values and actions played during the last plays .    in the first algorithm , at each time step , each sensor repeatedly updates its action synchronously , either trying some new action or selecting the action which corresponds to a higher utility value in the most recent two time steps .",
    "the first advantage of this algorithm over the payoff - based learning algorithms of  @xcite@xcite is its simpler dynamics , which reduces the computational complexity .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm employs a diminishing exploration rate ( in contrast to the constant one in  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the dynamically changing exploration rate renders the algorithm an inhomogeneous markov chain ( instead of the homogeneous ones in  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this technical change allows us to prove convergence in probability to the set of ( constrained ) nash equilibria from which no agent is willing to unilaterally deviate .",
    "thus , the property is substantially stronger than those in  @xcite@xcite where the algorithms are guaranteed to converge to nash equilibria with a sufficiently large probability by choosing a sufficiently small exploration rate in advance .",
    "the second algorithm is asynchronous . at each time step",
    ", only one sensor is active and updates its state by either trying some new action or selecting an action according to a gibbs - like distribution from those played in last two time steps when it was active .",
    "the algorithm is shown to be convergent in probability to the set of global maxima of a coverage performance metric .",
    "compared with the synchronous payoff - based log - linear learning algorithm in  @xcite , this algorithm is asynchronous and simpler .",
    "furthermore , rather than maximizing the associated potential function , the second algorithm optimizes a different global function which captures better a global trade - off between the overall network benefit from sensing and the total energy the network consumes . again , by employing a diminishing exploration rate , our algorithm is guaranteed to have stronger convergence properties that the ones in  @xcite .",
    "here , we first review some basic game - theoretic concepts ; see , for example  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to formulate subsequently an optimal coverage problem for mobile visual sensor networks as a repeated multi - player game .",
    "we then introduce notation used throughout the paper",

    "this measure corresponds to the area of the visual sensor footprint and can serve to approximate the energy consumption or the cost incurred by image processing algorithms .",

    "<S> motivated by current challenges in data - intensive sensor networks , we formulate a coverage optimization problem for mobile visual sensors as a ( constrained ) repeated multi - player game . </S>",
    "<S> each visual sensor tries to optimize its own coverage while minimizing the processing cost . </S>",
    "<S> we present two distributed learning algorithms where each sensor only remembers its own utility values and actions played during the last plays . </S>",
    "<S> these algorithms are proven to be convergent in probability to the set of ( constrained ) nash equilibria and global optima of certain coverage performance metric , respectively . </S>"
