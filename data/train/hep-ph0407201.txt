    "the brahms collaboration has recently presented measurements of the ratio @xmath0 of hadron production cross sections in dau and @xmath1 collisions  @xcite . with increasing hadron rapidity",
    ", the data indicate a growing suppression of the ratio . theoretical analyses of the data have focused on nuclear effects related to the gold nucleus , emphasizing variously the role of small @xmath3 physics in the nuclear production  @xcite , as well as of nuclear - enhanced power corrections in the da cross section @xcite .",
    "other studies  @xcite have addressed the question of whether leading - twist shadowing could be responsible for the observed suppression .    in the present paper",
    "we hope to add valuable information that will have an impact on the present and future attempts to interpret the brahms data , and on plans for further measurements .",
    "we base our analysis on next - to - leading order ( nlo ) leading - twist perturbative - qcd ( pqcd ) calculations of inclusive hadron production .",
    "such calculations have enjoyed considerable success in comparisons with data from @xmath1 collisions at rhic at @xmath4  gev .",
    "they yield good agreement with the phenix data  @xcite for @xmath5 at central rapidities , and with data from star  @xcite on @xmath5 at forward rapidities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the latter being essentially in the kinematic range explored by brahms in their most forward measurements .",
    "it is appropriate to point out that there are sizable uncertainties in the nlo calculation , related to the choice of fragmentation functions and scales .",
    "however , we are confident that for the kinematics relevant for brahms nlo pqcd does explain at least 50% of the cross section , as a conservative estimate , and hence is a viable tool for obtaining deeper insights into the production mechanism , at least for @xmath1 collisions .    the main point of our analysis",
    "can be stated very simply : the nuclear effect reported by brahms actually appears to be substantially larger than appreciated in the studies  @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that in the very forward region , at rapidities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , brahms only measured _ negatively charged _ hadrons ( @xmath10 ) and not the charge average @xmath11 as at the more central rapidities . in the ratio @xmath12",
    "the denominator refers to @xmath1 collisions , and negatively charged hadrons are expected to be produced more rarely in @xmath1 than in da collisions , for which from isospin considerations it follows that at least @xmath13 and @xmath14 should be produced in equal numbers .",
    "this immediately implies that the ratio of @xmath15 and @xmath16 cross sections is `` intrinsically enhanced '' , by actually a factor of about 1.5 , as we will show . the fact that brahms nonetheless reports a suppression of the ratio is therefore truly remarkable and awaits further investigation .",
    "we also revisit in our analysis the following questions :    ( i ) : :    what are the most relevant parton momentum fractions @xmath3    for hadron production at brahms , in particular at very forward    rapidity @xmath9 where the suppression of    @xmath12 is largest ?",
    "to what extent are truly    small @xmath3 , say , @xmath17 probed ?",
    "( ii ) : :    how relevant is leading - twist nuclear shadowing for the explanation of    the brahms data ?",
    "these questions have already been addressed in some detail in  @xcite .",
    "our analysis extends that study by providing results within a full nlo calculation .",
    "this will generally lead to more reliable results .",
    "in addition , the enhancement effect mentioned above has of course also direct implications for estimates for @xmath12 obtained when using leading - twist nuclear shadowing .",
    "our calculations therefore provide an improved estimate as compared to the results of  @xcite , where the enhancement was not taken into account .",
    "we furthermore explore more thoroughly the possible effects of leading - twist nuclear shadowing by making more extreme assumptions on the structure of screening at intermediate @xmath3 , tolerated because of possible uncertainties in the connection between diffractive hera data and gluon shadowing .    in sec .",
    "[ elementary ] we discuss the ranges of partonic momentum fractions mainly probed by the forward brahms data .",
    "section [ nuclshad ] addresses the leading - twist nuclear shadowing and its relevance in forward da scattering . with the findings of sections  [ elementary ] and [ nuclshad ] , we are in the position to discuss @xmath12 in the forward region in more detail .",
    "this is done in section  [ isospin ] , where we emphasize our main point related to the normalization of @xmath12 by the @xmath16 cross section .",
    "we summarize and conclude with section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are initial hadrons and @xmath20 is a hadron in the final state produced at high transverse momentum @xmath21 .",
    "since large @xmath21 ensures large momentum transfer , the cross section for the process may be written in a factorized form , @xmath22 & & \\times \\ ,   d \\hat{\\sigma}_{ab}^{c}(x_1 p_{h_1 } , x_2 p_{h_2 } , p_h / z , \\mu ) \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all contributing partonic channels @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the associated short - distance cross section which may be evaluated in qcd perturbation theory : @xmath25 the leading - order ( lo ) contributions @xmath26 are of order @xmath27 ; the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are known  @xcite and will be included in our analysis .    in eq .",

    "the dependence on @xmath29 is actually quite large even at nlo  @xcite ; however , in this work we are mainly interested in ratios of cross sections for which the @xmath29 dependence is fairly insignificant .",
    "the lower limits of the integrations over momentum fractions in eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) may be derived in terms of @xmath36 and the pseudorapidity @xmath37 of the produced hadron .",
    "they are given by @xmath38 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these equations it follows that at central rapidities @xmath39 the momentum fractions @xmath40 and @xmath41 can become as small as roughly @xmath42 . in _",
    "forward _ scattering , that is , at ( large ) positive @xmath37 , the collisions become very asymmetric . in particular , @xmath41 may become fairly small , whereas @xmath40 tends to be large . for forward kinematics at brahms one has , typically , @xmath43 gev and @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that @xmath41 may become as small as @xmath45 .",
    "however , in practice it turns out that such small @xmath41 hardly ever contribute to the cross section : if @xmath41 is so small , the hadron with transverse momentum @xmath21 can only be produced if both @xmath40 and @xmath34 are unity , where however the parton distributions @xmath46 and the fragmentation functions @xmath32 vanish .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of kinematics , as demonstrated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "one can show that if the parton density @xmath46 behaves at large @xmath40 as @xmath47 and @xmath32 as @xmath48 ( with some powers @xmath49 ) , the @xmath41-integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) vanishes in the vicinity of @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , contributions from very small @xmath41 are highly suppressed .",
    "the question , then , remains of how small @xmath41 really is on average for forward kinematics at rhic .",
    "this is of course relevant for judging various explanations for the suppression of @xmath12 seen by brahms , in particular those relating to saturation effects in the nucleus wave function  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the distribution of the cross section for @xmath52 at @xmath4  gev , @xmath53  gev , @xmath9 , in bins of @xmath54 .",
    "the overall normalization is unimportant of course ; for definiteness we note that the sum of all entries shown in the plot yields the full nlo invariant cross section @xmath55 in pb / gev@xmath56 . for the calculation we have chosen the cteq6 m @xcite parton distribution functions and the fragmentation functions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can see that the distribution peaks at @xmath57 .",
    "there are several ways to estimate an average @xmath58 of the distribution .",
    "for example , one may define @xmath58 in the standard way from evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with an extra factor @xmath41 in the integrand , divided by the integral itself : @xmath59 where the ellipses denote the remaining factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one may simply determine @xmath58 as the median of the distribution , demanding that the area under the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] to the left of @xmath58 equals that to the right .",
    "either way , one finds an average @xmath60 , typically @xmath61 at this @xmath21 and @xmath37 .",
    "the precise shape of the distribution and the value of @xmath58 depend somewhat on the parton distributions ( and , less so , on the fragmentation functions ) chosen .",
    "we remind the reader that the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] is at @xmath53  gev and that we have chosen the factorization and renormalization scales to be @xmath35 .",
    "this means that we are using a fairly low scale in the parton densities . at this scale , the cteq6 densities , in particular the gluon ,",
    "are still relatively flat towards small @xmath3 . in order to estimate to",
    "what extent this influences the distribution , we have calculated it for the grv @xcite parton distributions , which are steeper at this scale .",
    "the corresponding histogram in @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "one can see that as expected it peaks somewhat more to the left ; nevertheless there is not much quantitative change in the average @xmath41 .",
    "the full invariant cross section is about @xmath62 smaller than for the cteq6 set .",
    "we have mentioned in the introduction that there are data from star for the cross section for @xmath52 in roughly this kinematic range @xcite which are in very good agreement with the nlo calculation used in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this supports the view that the distributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] are realistic .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the @xmath54 distribution at @xmath63  gev . at this @xmath21 ,",
    "one is closer to the boundary of phase space given by the condition @xmath64 , where all momentum fractions @xmath65 are forced to 1 .",
    "the distribution in @xmath41 is therefore more `` squeezed '' and shifted to the right .",
    "the effect is countered to some extent by evolution since at scale @xmath66  gev the parton distributions are steeper than at @xmath67  gev .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] we present results for the averages of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath34 , as functions of pion transverse momentum and rapidity at @xmath4  gev .",
    "here we have defined @xmath58 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq4av ] ) , with analogous definitions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the upper row shows results for fixed @xmath21 in forward scattering . besides @xmath9 as relevant for brahms , we have also extended the results to @xmath70 which may be useful for future experimental studies .",
    "it becomes evident that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are very large in forward scattering , as expected .",
    "@xmath72 is particularly large because , on account of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the single fragmentation function has to compete with two parton densities , each function being strongly suppressed at large momentum fraction . as we have already seen in the histograms , figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1][fig : fig3 ] , @xmath73 is much smaller .",
    "as @xmath21 increases and the boundary of phase space is approached , all momentum fractions become larger and eventually converge to unity .",
    "we also note an unexpected upturn of @xmath73 toward smaller @xmath21 .",
    "we have not been able to identify this effect as resulting from any straightforward origin .",
    "the precise small-@xmath3 behavior of the parton distributions at the rather low scales involved here plays a role ( however , the effect also occurs for the steeper grv distributions ) . the structure of the cross section formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) itself is also partly responsible . in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show the averages as functions of rapidity for two fixed values of @xmath21 . at @xmath74",
    "one obviously starts from @xmath75 ; with increasing @xmath37 the two momentum fractions become very different . toward",
    "@xmath76 they again both tend to unity ; for @xmath77 this happens rather late .",
    "in da collisions , nuclear effects will alter the distribution in @xmath41 as well as the full cross section . shadowing effects at small-@xmath41 , @xmath78 ,",
    "will lower the cross section and will lead to yet higher average @xmath41 being probed .",
    "there will also be enhancements at larger @xmath41 , @xmath79 , associated with yet another coherent nuclear effect , antishadowing .",
    "this will be followed by the suppression related to the emc effect for @xmath80 , and by the subsequent enhancement explained by the fermi motion for @xmath81 .    since in the brahms kinematics the average @xmath41 is near 0.01 , the principal nuclear effect is shadowing .",
    "we investigate its role in the interpretation of the brahms data by considering leading - twist shadowing , using the parameterization of nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) derived in  @xcite .",
    "unlike most other sets of npdfs  @xcite , these functions have a rather rapid and strong onset of shadowing toward small-@xmath3 , so they may serve as a good tool for studying the `` maximally possible '' effects of leading - twist nuclear shadowing in forward da scattering .",
    "the recent study  @xcite has also employed the npdfs of  @xcite , albeit only in the framework of a lowest order ( lo ) calculation .",
    "we note that we will neglect any nuclear effects in the deuteron , for which we just use @xmath82 .",
    "as follows from our analysis of the average @xmath40 , the deuteron parton distributions are sampled at values of @xmath40 in the domain of the emc effect .",
    "therefore , the approximation @xmath82 is valid to a few per cent accuracy , as can be estimated as follows .",
    "the cteq fits use the neutron structure function extracted from the deuteron data within the framework of the convolution approximation ( fermi motion ) .",
    "the convolution model gives for the structure function ratio @xmath83 the values of 0.99 for @xmath84 and of @xmath85 for @xmath86 . as a result",
    ", our @xmath87 approximation overestimates the true deuteron parton distributions by about @xmath88 at @xmath84 and underestimates them by a few percent at @xmath86 .",
    "since large @xmath40 are important in our calculations , proper account of this would make the effect we will discuss in the next section even slightly bigger .",
    "note that for heavier nuclei the convolution model contradicts the emc effect .",
    "however here we are using it to `` restore '' the deuteron structure function within the procedure used to extract the neutron structure function ; see @xcite for an extensive discussion of nuclear effects in the deuteron parton densities .",
    "let us now briefly describe the approach of  @xcite for deriving npdfs .",
    "leading - twist nuclear shadowing is obtained using gribov s theorem  @xcite relating nuclear shadowing to diffraction , collins s qcd factorization theorem for hard diffraction in dis  @xcite , and the qcd analysis of hard diffraction measured at hera in terms of diffractive parton distribution functions of the proton .",
    "operationally , the npdfs are first derived at the initial scale @xmath89=2 gev and for @xmath90 .",
    "standard ( nlo ) dglap evolution is then used to obtain the npdfs for @xmath91 .",
    "analyses of dis by both h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite demonstrate that diffraction constitutes @xmath92% of the total cross section in the quark - dominated channel and as much as @xmath93% in the gluon channel . as a result , it is found in  @xcite that the effect of nuclear shadowing in npdfs is large and , even more strikingly , much stronger in the gluon npdf at small @xmath3 than in the quark npdfs .",
    "conservation of the baryon number and the momentum sum rule then require that the depletion of npdfs at small values of @xmath3 , @xmath94 , be accompanied by a certain enhancement at @xmath95 .",
    "the transition from shadowing to enhancement , and the enhancement itself , are not described by the gribov theorem and , hence , can be only modeled . using the available fixed - target nuclear dis data  @xcite as a guide",
    ", the `` standard '' scenario of @xcite assumes that the transition from nuclear shadowing to the enhancement takes place at @xmath96 for quark npdfs , and at @xmath97 for the gluon npdf . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this set of npdfs as `` shadowing 1 '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the distribution of the nlo cross section for @xmath98 in @xmath54 , using shadowing 1 . for comparison",
    ", we also display the previous result for @xmath52 of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "a clear shift in the distribution to larger @xmath41 is visible . at small @xmath41",
    ", there are significant shadowing effects , while at large @xmath41 there is a small contribution from antishadowing .",
    "it is evident from comparison of the areas underneath the distributions that the net effect on the @xmath99 cross section will be a decrease .",
    "however , one can anticipate that the decrease will be rather moderate : while nuclear shadowing does deplete the @xmath100 cross section compared to the @xmath1 cross section , the probed values of @xmath41 are clearly not small enough to deliver a significant nuclear shadowing effect .",
    "the kinematics for forward scattering at brahms mostly corresponds to values of @xmath41 in the transition region between shadowing and antishadowing , where the predictions for npdfs are rather uncertain .",
    "therefore , in addition to the standard scenario ( `` shadowing 1 '' ) of nuclear shadowing , we have also explored an option for which nuclear shadowing in the gluon channel is increased by extending it up to @xmath96 , similarly to the shadowing in the quark densities .",
    "we refer to the resulting set of npdfs as `` shadowing 2 '' .",
    "the corresponding @xmath54 distribution of the cross section for @xmath98 is also displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] . compared to shadowing 1 ,",
    "there is only a small modification of the distribution , which will lead to a very slight further suppression of the da cross section .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that one can hardly increase the amount of gluon shadowing at @xmath101 since here there are constraints from @xmath102 data  @xcite .",
    "the model of  @xcite gives a reasonable description of the observed suppression by a factor @xmath103 , which would be spoilt by a much stronger gluon shadowing . at the same time , as soon as the amount of gluon shadowing at @xmath104 is fixed , the gradual decrease of shadowing with increasing @xmath3 is automatic as a consequence of the decrease of the coherence length @xmath105 and of a smaller probability for diffraction . therefore , we conclude that the standard effect of leading twist nuclear shadowing will at best be able to explain only a small fraction of the dramatic suppression of the spectra of charged hadrons at forward rapidities observed by brahms .",
    "this statement is in line with the lo result in the revised version of  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the corresponding results for @xmath63  gev . here",
    ", larger @xmath41 are probed , and only slight antishadowing effects appear .",
    "so far we have only considered @xmath106 production as an example .",
    "this is however not really appropriate for a comparison with the brahms data which , at forward rapidities , are for negatively charged hadrons @xmath10 .",
    "as we will now show , for the case of @xmath10 , even in presence of the shadowing effects just discussed , the leading - twist nlo calculation predicts an _ enhancement _ , rather than a suppression , of @xmath12 .",
    "we now consider the ratio @xmath12 of single - inclusive hadron cross sections in @xmath100 and @xmath1 scattering .",
    "the brahms experiment has presented data  @xcite for @xmath12 as a function of hadron transverse momentum @xmath21 , in four different bins of hadron pseudorapidity @xmath37 , with central values @xmath107 .",
    "brahms sees a significant suppression of the ratio with increasing @xmath37 .    while brahms measures inclusive charged hadrons , @xmath108 , at central rapidities ( @xmath74 and 1 ) , their @xmath12 data at forward rapidities refer only to _",
    "negatively _ charged hadrons @xmath10 .",
    "this has profound consequences . to see this ,",
    "let us assume for the moment that pions dominate the spectrum of observed high-@xmath21 hadrons .",
    "negatively charged pions are produced more rarely than positively charged ones in @xmath1 collisions , due to the up - quark dominance in the proton .",
    "an example for this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , where we display data for the @xmath109 ratio from the isr  @xcite at @xmath110  gev .",
    "we also show the result of the nlo calculation , using the fragmentation functions of ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides separate sets for negatively and positively charged pions .",
    "[ we note that there are also @xmath109 data at @xmath111  gev  @xcite which lie lower and are in less impressive agreement with nlo pqcd . ]    as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] shows , there is clear excess of positive pions over negative ones .",
    "in contrast , isospin considerations imply that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are produced practically equally in dau collisions .",
    "therefore , one expects @xmath12 for negatively charged pions to be intrinsically enhanced , if it is normalized by the @xmath1 cross section and not , for example , by the @xmath112 one .    to go into a little more quantitative detail",
    ", we recall that at forward rapidities the partonic collisions are very asymmetric .",
    "large contributions to the scattering come from situations in which a large-@xmath40 valence quark in the `` projectile '' ( i.e. , in the deuteron , or in one of the protons ) hits a small-@xmath41 gluon in the `` target '' ( i.e. , in the gold nucleus or in the other proton ) .",
    "the underlying ( lo ) subprocess is then the quark - gluon compton process @xmath113 . for negatively charged pions",
    "one then expects that down quarks play a particularly important role in the compton process , since both the `` projectile '' and the produced @xmath14 have a @xmath114 valence quark . to a good approximation ( see the previous section ) , the deuteron s @xmath114 valence density is given by @xmath115 where we have used isospin invariance to relate the valence-@xmath114 distribution in the neutron to the valence-@xmath116 in the proton . due to the up - quark excess in the proton , the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dval ] ) becomes much larger than the proton s @xmath114-valence distribution at high @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , resulting in an enhancement in @xmath12 .    of course",
    ", other scattering channels will contribute as well and dilute this valence effect .",
    "in addition , brahms does not measure only pions , but inclusive charged hadrons , @xmath117 .",
    "nevertheless , when changing to charged - hadron fragmentation functions as given by  @xcite , we find that the difference in deuteron and proton valence densities continues to play an important role in the forward production of negatively charged hadrons .",
    "this is demonstrated by fig .  [",
    "fig : fig9 ] .",
    "the solid lines show the ratio @xmath12 at @xmath74 and @xmath118 for _ summed _ charged hadrons @xmath108 , and at @xmath8 and @xmath119 for _ negatively charged _ hadrons , exactly corresponding to the brahms conditions .",
    "we have used the `` shadowing 1 '' set described in the previous section . as shown in sec .",
    "[ elementary ] , when going from @xmath74 to @xmath120 , the average @xmath41 probed slightly decreases , and shadowing effects start to become visible at the smaller @xmath21 . at @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "the @xmath41 become yet smaller , but since now negatively charged hadrons are measured , the valence effect discussed above outweighs any stronger shadowing , and in fact the ratio @xmath12 strongly increases with @xmath21 because larger and larger @xmath40 become relevant . for comparison",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] the results at @xmath8 and @xmath9 for _ summed _ charged hadrons ( dashed lines ) . for these , the effective valence densities in the proton and deuteron are the same , and the enhancement seen for negative hadrons disappears .",
    "shadowing effects of up to @xmath62 are visible then , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , and as also found in ref .",
    "@xcite where only summed charged hadrons were considered .",
    "it is remarkable that for the highest @xmath121  gev at @xmath9 the curve for @xmath10 is enhanced by about a factor 1.5 with respect to the one for summed charges .",
    "our analysis so far has been entirely based on a nlo pqcd leading - twist calculation and the use of fragmentation functions extracted from @xmath122 annihilation data .",
    "we expect that even if nonperturbative phenomena are important in the kinematic regime explored by brahms , the enhancement in @xmath12 resulting due the different `` projectiles '' in the numerator and denominator will persist . here , our reasoning is as follows : isr data ( see  @xcite and references therein ) on @xmath123 production at @xmath124  gev and large feynman-@xmath125 were found to be consistent with @xmath126 , @xmath127 , where @xmath116 and @xmath114 are typical densities for up and down valence quarks .",
    "such spectra in @xmath128 are much harder than the ones pqcd would give , indicating the presence of a nonperturbative production mechanism .",
    "nonetheless , the ratio of @xmath13 to @xmath14 cross sections is of a similar magnitude as the one in the perturbative regime shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] .",
    "adding the fact that the yields of @xmath129 in da scattering should be equal because of isospin , irrespective of the production mechanism , we are led to the conclusion that @xmath12 for negatively charged hadrons should be enhanced even if nonperturbative effects dominate .",
    "note here that nonperturbative effects in the fragmentation region are known to be consistent with the feynman scaling .",
    "hence if nonperturbative effects are important they should lead to about the same @xmath109 ratio in @xmath1 scattering for the same @xmath128 at isr and at rhic .",
    "we finally note that a potential caveat to our main finding in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] comes from a further set of brahms data .",
    "while we have mentioned that brahms measures all hadrons and not just pions , we have generally assumed that pions dominate the observed hadron spectrum .",
    "however , preliminary data from brahms  @xcite show that the cross section for @xmath130 becomes significantly larger than that for @xmath131 at @xmath132  gev . at @xmath133  gev",
    ", they observe about three times as many @xmath134 as @xmath10 .",
    "as we have pointed out before , isospin excludes that such an excess could be due to pions : @xmath135 , up to corrections of a few per cent related to the fact that the gold nucleus is not isoscalar .",
    "standard sets of fragmentation functions do not predict large contributions from kaons and protons , and in the nlo calculation one ends up with @xmath136 at most only @xmath137 larger than @xmath138 .",
    "it is hard to conceive that proton production could lead to a large enhancement of @xmath134 over @xmath10 ( that even increases with @xmath21 ) but , barring any experimental systematic problem , this appears to be the conclusion at present .",
    "if the final brahms data continue to show this large excess , it will be a challenge to understand it in terms of a nonperturbative effect .",
    "such an effect could , perhaps , result from coalescence of quarks from the incoming nucleon with other partons , to form a baryon . for this to work",
    ", the quarks would need to experience large transverse `` kicks '' and would need to lose a significant fraction of their momentum .",
    "such a possibility could be connected to the expectations of a very strong suppression of the forward nucleon spectrum in central nucleon - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "we have shown that there is an intrinsic enhancement in the ratio @xmath0 for negatively charged hadrons , simply because of the different nature of the `` projectile '' ( deuteron vs. proton ) in the numerator and denominator of @xmath0 . in the light of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig9 ] the significant suppression seen by brahms at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is even more striking than usually appreciated .",
    "the effect we have found has not been taken into account in any previous theoretical study  @xcite of the data , to our knowledge .",
    "we expect that future data for @xmath0 for _ summed _ charged hadrons in this kinematic regime will show an even stronger suppression than observed for @xmath10 , roughly by a factor 1.5 .",
    "the same should happen if @xmath139 , rather than @xmath0 , were measured for @xmath10 .",
    "because of the effect , it is entirely impossible to explain the suppression in @xmath0 at forward rapidities by a conventional modification of the leading - twist parton densities in nuclei .",
    "however , _ even if _ we disregard the effect , nuclear leading - twist shadowing plays a rather unimportant role , giving at most a suppression of @xmath62 .",
    "the reason for this is that parton momentum fractions in the gold nucleus are not very small on average even for forward kinematics , as we have shown . in other words ,",
    "a large nuclear contribution originates from a range of @xmath3 where nuclear effects are known to be small ( or even antishadowed ) .",
    "this generally sets severe limitations on the ability of _ any _ initial - state small-@xmath3 effects to explain the observed suppression .",
    "we have also mentioned that the fact that brahms observes the cross section for @xmath140 to be significantly larger than that for @xmath131 at @xmath132  gev , indicates the presence of sizable nonperturbative contributions possibly related to protons .",
    "it appears likely that mechanisms responsible for an enhancement of proton production then also play a role in the observed suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "nonperturbative production of pions , too , could play a role : coalescence effects involving spectator partons are likely to be strongly suppressed in p(d)a collisions as compared to the @xmath1 case  @xcite .",
    "this suppression is further enhanced when energies are large enough to resolve the small-@xmath3 high gluon densities  @xcite .",
    "such non - leading twist effects should decrease with increase of the transverse momentum of the pion , which is consistent with the trend in the data on @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed excess of @xmath140 over @xmath141 actually _ in_creases with @xmath21 , which is quite challenging to understand .",
    "note also that the parton energy losses that would be necessary to reproduce the brahms effect appear to be rather large : about 10% energy loss would be needed if it occurred only in the initial state before the interaction .",
    "if one assumes that the rate of energy loss is the same in the initial and final states , a loss of about 3% is necessary . for the kinematics relevant here , the suppression is more sensitive to losses in the final state since the average @xmath142 for fragmentation was found to be substantially closer to one than the averages @xmath143 in the parton densities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .    to further investigate experimentally the origin of the suppression in @xmath0",
    "it would be useful to perform measurements of dihadron production . within lo kinematics ,",
    "the pseudorapidities of the two hadrons are related by @xmath144 .",
    "one may therefore single out contributions from small @xmath41 by demanding that both hadrons be rather forward .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] shows this for a sample calculation .",
    "we assume that a `` trigger '' hadron ( @xmath106 ) is detected with transverse momentum @xmath145 and forward rapidity @xmath146 .",
    "let the second @xmath106 have @xmath147 . without any restriction on the rapidity @xmath148 of the second hadron ,",
    "one then obtains the higher @xmath54-distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "as expected , these look very much like the single - hadron distributions shown in sections  [ elementary ] and  [ nuclshad ] .",
    "if now the second hadron is also in the forward region at @xmath149 , the lower distribution is obtained , which is entirely located at @xmath150 .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] the corresponding results for dau collisions , using our `` shadowing 1 '' .",
    "the shadowing effects are much more relevant for the double - forward distribution , as expected .",
    "we note that the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] are normalized such that they sum to the cross section @xmath151 in pb / gev .",
    "it is evident that there is a significant decrease in rate for two forward hadrons .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : fig10 ] are only lo . the nlo corrections are expected to be sizable ; they are available  @xcite .",
    "the two hadrons we have studied in fig .  [ fig : fig10 ] would be nearly back - to - back in azimuthal angle . further insights into the dynamics may be gained by studying back - to - back azimuthal correlations  @xcite .",
    "we finally note that small-@xmath41 effects might also become more readily accessible in conceivable future @xmath152 collisions after increase of the proton energy to 250  gev at a later stage of rhic operations .",
