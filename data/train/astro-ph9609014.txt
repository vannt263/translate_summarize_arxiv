    "the three - dimensional distribution of galaxies in the redshift surveys differ from the true one since the distance to each galaxy can not be determined by its redshift @xmath2 only ; for @xmath3 the peculiar velocity of galaxies , typically @xmath4 , contaminates the true recession velocity of the hubble flow , while the true distance for objects at @xmath5 sensitively depends on the ( unknown and thus assumed ) cosmological parameters .",
    "this hampers the effort to understand the true distribution of large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "nevertheless such redshift - space distortion effects are quite useful since through the detailed theoretical modelling , one can derive the peculiar velocity dispersions of galaxies as a function of separation , and also can infer the cosmological density parameter @xmath0 and the dimensionless cosmological constant @xmath1 , for instance . in",
    "what follows , i will present two specific topics concerning the redshift distortion ; the small - scale pair - wise peculiar velocity dispersions of galaxies@xcite , and anisotropies in the two - point correlation functions@xcite at high redshifts .",
    "assuming that particle pairs in expanding universes are in `` statistical equilibrium '' on small scales , their relative peculiar velocity dispersion can be computed as a function of their separation .",
    "the result is called the cosmic virial theorem @xcite ( cvt , hereafter ) which predicts the one - dimensional pair - wise relative peculiar velocity dispersion @xmath6 as a function of @xmath0 .    the observed two- and three - point correlation functions of _ galaxies _ , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are well approximated by the simple form@xcite : @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that the two- and three - point correlation functions of _ mass _ , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , also obey the same scaling except for the overall amplitude : @xmath15 then the cvt prediction of the small - scale peculiar velocity dispersion is given by@xcite @xmath16 \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and numerically @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "to what extent is the cvt prediction reliable ? in order to examine this , i compared @xmath20 with the one - dimensional peculiar velocity dispersions of particle pairs with separation @xmath21 ^ 2 \\rangle^{1/2 } $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ptpcvt ] summarizes the comparison which implies that @xmath20 reproduces the simulation result excellently for @xmath22 ; cvt is quite reliable in predicting @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "it should be stressed that the crucial assumption in deriving the prediction ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) is equation ( [ eq : hier ] ) , and the result is independent of the theoretical model for dark matter . in this sense",
    "the prediction ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) is general , and the good agreement in cdm models should be ascribed to the fact that the cdm models actually satisfy the relation ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) .    using the anisotropy of the two - point correlation function of the cfa1 galaxy redshift survey , davis and peebles@xcite estimated the line of sight peculiar velocity dispersions @xmath25 of galaxy pairs",
    "seen projected at separation @xmath26 .",
    "this is related to the dispersions @xmath27 for galaxy pairs with separation @xmath28 in three dimension as @xmath29 note that davis and peebles@xcite found that @xmath30 which justifies our assumption of the _ mass _ correlation function @xmath31 as @xmath32 from a dynamical point of view . if @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the corresponding cvt estimator corrected for the projection becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gamma function .",
    "thus @xmath37 is the correction factor for the projection effect@xcite ; @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "independent estimates of @xmath41 are available from several galaxy redshift catalogues@xcite .",
    "as pointed out earlier by mo , jing , and brner@xcite , the currently available redshift catalogues are far from the fair sample , and the observational estimate of @xmath25 may differ from its true cosmic average due to the limited survey volume and the selection effect . therefore it is meaningful to re - examine the problem in more details .",
    "if the hierarchical relation ( [ eq : hier ] ) holds as is indicated from the galaxy distribution , the amplitudes of the two- and three - point correlation functions , or equivalently @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are the two uncertain parameters in the cvt prediction ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) .",
    "recent numerical and analytical studies in nonlinear gravitational clustering seem to indicate that @xmath43 can be approximated as a constant in the range of @xmath44 and @xmath45 which depends very weakly on the underlying cosmological model . thus if the value of @xmath42 is fixed from the cobe data assuming cdm models , for example , the cvt prediction ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) is completely specified .",
    "figure [ fig : cobesigma8 ] plots the empirical fit for the cobe normalized @xmath46 and @xmath47 by nakamura@xcite to the numerical computation by sugiyama@xcite .",
    "there i adopt the baryon density parameter @xmath48 .",
    "incidentally it is amusing to note that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 cdm model just corresponds to @xmath52 , i.e. , _ galaxies faithfully trace mass _ in this model according to the cobe normalization .    once the @xmath42 is specified , it is easy to compute the cvt prediction ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma12rp ] plots @xmath53 ( eq.[[eq : cvtproj ] ] ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the symbols denote several recent observational estimates which are shifted along the x - axis just for illustration .",
    "the left panel shows the dependence on @xmath43 and the right panel shows how the cvt prediction is sensitive to their _ local _ value , or sample - to - sample variation of the data .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma12rp ] exhibits that both observational estimates and cvt predictions of @xmath54 vary by a factor of @xmath55 depending on the local clustering degree of each sample . even allowing for these",
    ", however , it looks unlikely that high - density cdm models ( @xmath56 ) are compatible with the currently observed values of @xmath54 . in a similar argument , one may obtain strong upper limits on @xmath0 in general cosmological scenarios as long as @xmath42 is not much greater than unity .",
    "as shown in the previous section , small - scale velocity dispersions of galaxies place strong upper limits on @xmath0 , fairly independently of @xmath1 .",
    "in turn , detailed analysis of clustering of objects at high redshifts will place a potentially important constraint on @xmath1 via an effect which we call the _ cosmological redshift distortion_@xcite . a very similar idea",
    "was put forward independently by ballinger , peacock and heavens@xcite although they work entirely in k - space .",
    "the result that i describe below considers the analysis of two - point correlation functions , which would be more straightforward to derived from the quasar catalogues .",
    "let us consider a pair of objects located at redshifts @xmath57 and @xmath58 whose redshift difference @xmath59 is much less than the mean redshift @xmath60 .",
    "then the observable separations of the pair parallel and perpendicular to the line - of - sight direction , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are given as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , where @xmath65 is the hubble constant and @xmath66 denotes the angular separation of the pair on the sky .",
    "the cosmological redshift - space distortion originates from the anisotropic mapping between the redshift - space coordinates , @xmath67 , and the real comoving ones@xcite , @xmath68 ; @xmath69 is written in terms of the angular diameter distance @xmath70 as @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the relation between the two - point correlation functions of quasars in redshift space , @xmath73 , and that of _ mass _ in real space @xmath74 can be derived in linear theory@xcite : @xmath75 ^",

    "the resulting contours are plotted in figure [ fig : xicont ] .",
    "the four sets of values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are indicated at the top of each panel .",
    "we adopt the cobe normalization@xcite .    in order to quantify the cosmological redshift distortion in figure [ fig : xicont ] ,",
    "let us introduce the anisotropy parameter @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the left four panels in figure [ fig : aniso ] show the anisotropy parameter against @xmath2 in cdm models .",
    "this clearly exhibits the extent to which one can discriminate the different @xmath1 models on the basis of the anisotropies in @xmath89 at high redshifts .",
    "one can roughly divide the source of cosmological information into four regimes ; ( i ) linear regime ( @xmath90 ) at @xmath91 , ( ii ) nonlinear regime ( @xmath92 ) at @xmath91 , ( iii ) linear regime at @xmath93 , and ( iv ) nonlinear regime at @xmath93 .",
    "the clustering feature at @xmath91 is best probed by galaxy redshift surveys , and the current samples , albeit statistically limited by the number of galaxies , are heavily used for a variety of cosmological tests .",
    "the conventional redshift - space distortion analysis@xcite in the regime ( i ) yields generally @xmath94 ; @xmath95 for instance from the durham / ukst galaxy redshift survey of @xmath96 galaxies .",
    "i have shown in the first part of the talk that the small - scale peculiar velocity dispersions of galaxies in comparison withe the cvt prediction constrains the value of @xmath97 . allowing for the sample - to - sample variation of the available redshift surveys and the uncertainties for @xmath43 and @xmath98 ,",
    "i still conclude that the observation in the regime ( ii ) favors low - density universes @xmath99 at most .",
    "in contrast to the regimes ( i ) and ( ii ) , the proper analysis of the regimes ( iii ) and ( iv ) requires a large number of quasars homogeneously samples which are not currently available .",
    "therefore the cosmological tests in theses regimes have not been fully explored even theoretically . in the second part of the talk , i presented an example in this line of investigations , cosmological redshift - space distortion@xcite .",
    "i derived the formula which describes the degree of the anisotropies of two - point correlation functions of quasars in linear regime ( iii ) , and argued that it is a potentially powerful discriminator of @xmath1 once @xmath0 is determined from the nearby observation . from the observational point of view , however , it would be much easier to detect the the anisotropies of two - point correlation functions in the regime ( iv ) .",
    "we are currently approaching this important area of research using the nonlinear theory and simulations@xcite .",
    "the second part of the present talk is based on my collaborative work with takahiko matsubara .",
    "i thank him for the fruitful and enjoyable collaboration , and yi - peng jing , takahiro t. nakamura and david weinberg for discussions .",
    "i am grateful to john peacock for calling my attention to their work@xcite prior to publication after we submitted the paper@xcite of the second part of the present talk .",
