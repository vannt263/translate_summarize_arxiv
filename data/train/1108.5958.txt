    "it is well known that the spiral arms of galaxies are density waves .",
    "this means that the spiral arms are not always composed of the same matter but they only represent the maxima of the density along every circle around the center .",
    "the stars passing through the spiral arms stay longer close to them , thus producing an increase of the local density .",
    "the linear theory of spiral density waves assumes that the potential v , the density @xmath0 ( or the surface density @xmath1 ) and the distribution function _ f _ ( phase space density ) have small deviations from their axisymmetric values ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) .",
    "this linear theory was initiated by lindblad @xmath5 but it was developed in its modern form by lin and shu @xmath6 , kalnajs @xmath7 , lynden - bell and kalnajs @xmath8 toomre @xmath9,and others .",
    "however the deviations near the main resonances of a galaxy ( inner and outer lindblad resonances and corotation ) are large , thus near these resonances a nonlinear theory is necessary ( contopoulos @xmath10 ) .    in both the linear and the nonlinear theory ,",
    "whenever the perturbation is relatively small , chaos is unimportant . although some chaotic orbits appear near all the unstable periodic orbits , their proportion and their effects are small .",
    "this is the case of most normal spirals , where the density perturbations are of order @xmath11 of the axisymmetric background .    on the other hand in barred galaxies",
    "the perturbations are large , of the order of @xmath12 . in such cases",
    "the chaotic orbits play an important role in the dynamics of the galaxies .",
    "the main chaotic effects in a galaxy appear near corotation .",
    "it is well known now that chaos is generated by the overlapping of resonances ( contopoulos @xmath13 , rosenbluth et al .",
    "@xmath13 , chirikov @xmath14 ) . in the region near corotation there are many resonances between the angular velocities of the stars @xmath15 ( in the frame rotating with the angular velocity of the pattern @xmath16 ) and the epicyclic frequence @xmath17 .",
    "the ratio of these frequencies is @xmath18    these resonances are congested in a relatively small interval of jacobi constants @xmath19 around the jacobi constant @xmath20 at corotation",
    ". some important resonances in an extended region around corotation are @xmath21 ( inside corotation ) , @xmath22 ( at corotation ) and @xmath23,@xmath24 ( outside corotation ) .",
    "chaos produced by the interactions of resonances , extends around the envelope of the bar and along the spiral arms beyond the end of the bar .",
    "the first example of a chaotic orbit that fills an envelope of the bar and the inner parts of the spiral structure was provided by kaufmann and contopoulos ( 1996 ) ( fig.1 ) .",
    "however the most surprising result came from n - body simulations , which indicated that most orbits along the spiral arms beyond the ends of the bar are chaotic ( voglis et al .",
    "@xmath25 ) .    thus started a systematic study of the chaotic spiral arms outside corotation in strong barred galaxies ( voglis and stavropoulos 2005 , voglis et al .",

    "we present the most recent results of this study .",
    "although the spiral arms beyond the ends of the bars are composed of chaotic orbits , nevertheless these spiral arms are density waves , i.e. the density maxima are populated by different stars at every time .",
    "the density of the stars is maximum in areas where their velocities are minimum .",
    "this happens mainly near the apocentres and the pericentres of the orbits . and",
    "these apocentres and pericentres appear close to the asymptotic manifolds of the main unstable periodic orbits around corotation .",
    "the most important families of unstable periodic orbits in the corotation region are the families @xmath33,@xmath34 around the unstable lagrangian points @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in a simple model of a barred galaxy the hamiltonian near corotation @xmath37 ( contopoulos @xmath38 )",
    "is given by the relation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the jacobi constant , @xmath41 the epicyclic action , @xmath42 is the azimuthal action , ( where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the angular momenta of the star and of corotation ) @xmath45 is the azimuth of the star and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are constants .",
    "the action @xmath41 is also constant , because the conjugate angle * @xmath52 * , does not appear in the hamiltonian .",
    "the orbits @xmath33 , @xmath34 are represented by the unstable equilibrium points of the system , namely when @xmath53 therefore @xmath54 and @xmath55 the orbits close to the lagrangian points @xmath35 , @xmath36 have @xmath56 and @xmath57 , ( while the orbits close to the lagrangian points @xmath58,@xmath59 have @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) ,    in the lowest approximation the orbits @xmath33 , @xmath34 start with @xmath56 , or @xmath62 and @xmath63 hence @xmath64 therefore these orbits exist whenever @xmath65 .    after finding @xmath41 we can find @xmath66 from eq.(5 ) .",
    "we have ( contopoulos @xmath67 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the angular velocity , and @xmath17 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "the subscript @xmath70 denotes the values at corotation and the accents mean derivatives with respect to the radius r. thus eq.(5 ) can be written @xmath71 we consider now a simple model of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the potential and @xmath74 is the force as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "then we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 thus eq.(9 ) gives @xmath78 and if @xmath79 we find that @xmath66 is negative . in particular in a keplerian model @xmath80 and the relation ( 13 ) becomes @xmath81    therefore @xmath82 .",
    "the initial point of the orbit @xmath33 ( with @xmath83 and increasing @xmath84 ) is @xmath85 inside the corotation distance with @xmath86 the orbit @xmath33 is described counterclockwise ( while the galaxy is rotating clockwise . )",
    "thus the orbit @xmath33 intersects the @xmath83 axis once more with @xmath87 and decreasing @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "@xmath34 on the configuration plane . ]",
    "the asymptotic manifolds from the orbits @xmath33 , @xmath34 on the configuration plane are shown in fig.2 .",
    "there are two unstable manifolds from @xmath33 namely @xmath88 along a trailing spiral and @xmath89 along the leading edge of the bar , and two stable manifolds , @xmath90 ( along a leading direction ) and s ( along the trailing edge of the bar ) .",
    "these manifolds contain successive apocentres ( @xmath91=0 ) ) of the asymptotic orbits i.e. orbits starting on this manifold .",
    "similar manifolds emanate from @xmath85 , @xmath92 , corresponding to the pericentres of the asymptotic orbits .    the orbits starting close to @xmath33 but not exactly on the asymptotic manifold approach this point along the stable directions @xmath93 and @xmath90 and then deviate along the unstable directions @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "after a longer time these orbits form trailing spiral arms and the envelope of the bar .",
    "the forms of the asymptotic curves emanating from @xmath33 and @xmath34 are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the curve u from @xmath33 reaches the neighborhood of @xmath34 , making oscillations around the asymptotic curve @xmath94 of larger and larger amplitude as it approaches @xmath34 , coming closer and closer to the asymptotic curves @xmath95 and @xmath96 from @xmath34 , which are symmetric to @xmath88 and @xmath89 with respect to the center of the galaxy .",
    "thus the matter that starts close to @xmath33 and moves along the asymptotic curve @xmath88 , after reaching the neighborhood of @xmath34 moves very close to the asymptotic curves @xmath95 and @xmath96 and approaches again the neighborhood of @xmath33 . in a similar way matter moves along the asymptotic curves @xmath89 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus we have circulation of the material along the spiral arms that lasts for a substantial fraction of the hubble time , until the spiral arms fade away .     and @xmath34 .",
    "]    the individual orbits along the asymptotic curve @xmath88 or close to it , are of the form of fig.4 .",
    "the orbits start by making some rotations close to the periodic orbit @xmath33 and they deviate away from @xmath33 , reaching the neighborhood of @xmath34",
    ". then they proceed either close to the spiral @xmath95 ( fig.4a ) , or close to the envelope of the bar @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "the unstable asymptotic curves of the various unstable periodic orbits for the same jacobi constant can not cross themselves or each other .",
    "thus they are obliged to follow nearly parallel paths .",
    "the main unstable orbits inside corotation are the families @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( inner lindblad ) , while close to corotation the most important families are @xmath100 and @xmath34 whose asymptotic manifolds are shown in fig",
    "on the other hand , all the manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits corresponding to the same jacobi constant , are approximately parallel and contribute to the formation of spiral arms outside corotation ( fig .",
    "this is the phenomenon of coalescence that was described by tsoutsis et al.(2008 ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    if we consider also similar figures for other values of the jacobi constant ( in which case overlapping of various curves is permitted ) we see the formation of thick spiral arms .",
    "in fact the observed spiral arms in n - body simulations of barred galaxies are very close to the general form of the spiral arms produced by the superposition of the various asymptotic curves .",
    "however orbits close to the particular unstable periodic orbits support particular parts of the spiral arms .",
    "thus it is of interest to study the orbits close to every resonance .",
    "the planar orbits in a time independent rotating model have a fixed jacobi constant ( that we call `` energy in the rotating frame '' ) @xmath103 where u is the velocity in the rotating frame , @xmath104 is the potential in polar coordinates , @xmath43 is the angular momentum and @xmath16 is the angular velocity of the system .",
    "if @xmath19 is larger that the energy @xmath105 at the lagrangian points @xmath106 , the orbits inside and outside corotation can communicate . if , however , @xmath107 the orbits inside corotation can not get outside and those outside corotation can not get inside .",
    "we consider a particular n - body system that was studied by voglis and stavropoulos ( 2005 ) and voglis et al .",
    "( 2006a ) simulating a barred spiral galaxy and we separate the orbits in particular intervals @xmath108 .",
    "we consider first the n - body orbits that have energies in the interval @xmath109 . in this energy level",
    "there are almost no regular orbits at all ( see fig . 3 of harsoula et al .",
    "2011 ) . for these energies the orbits can move both inside and outside corotation .",
    "we integrate the orbits with initial conditions outside corotation for @xmath110 ( half - mass crossing times ) and find the distribution of their @xmath111 values ( fig .",
    "the time interval @xmath112 is about one third of the hubble time . during that time most resonant",
    "orbits are concentrated near the resonances @xmath23 ( outer lindblad ) , @xmath24 and @xmath113 .",
    "only a few orbits have moved inside corotation @xmath114 .    however after about one and a half hubble time ( fig .",
    "6b ) the above resonances have fewer stars .",
    "some stars have escaped , but a substantial proportion of stars have reached the inner resonances @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( inner lindblad ) .",
    "these stars are trapped near these resonances for very long times before escaping again outwards . on the other hand stars starting inside corotation",
    "remain close to the resonances @xmath98 and @xmath99 for more than @xmath115 hubble times before escaping outside the galaxy ( without being trapped by the outer resonances ) .",
    "it must be pointed out here that the 2-body relaxation time for galaxies is of the order of @xmath116 hubble times , a time exceedingly longer that the diffusion time of the chaotic orbits in our n - body model .",
    "then we consider the stars outside corotation for an energy interval @xmath117 , where again only chaotic orbits exist outside corotation . in this case",
    "the orbits with initial conditions outside corotation can not enter inside corotation .    in figs .",
    "7a , b the distribution of the @xmath111-values of these stars is given , for the time intervals @xmath118 ( fig.@xmath119 ) and @xmath120 ( fig.@xmath121 ) . in this case",
    "there are no @xmath122 orbits , but we notice some important resonances like @xmath23 ( outer lindblad ) , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "after one and a half hubble times ( fig.@xmath121 ) the number of resonant stars has decreased and many stars have escaped beyond the ends of the galaxy . nevertheless there is still an appreciable number of stars close to these resonances .",
    "this is due to the stickiness phenomenon that lasts for very long times , before the stars escape from the galaxy . comparing figs .",
    "6 and 7 we notice that in the case of chaotic orbits that are restricted in the area outside corotation , stickiness to resonances lasts for longer times in smaller values of jacobi constants than in greater ones .",
    "thus in general , the diffusion of chaotic orbits supporting the outer parts of the spiral arms outwards is more slow than the diffusion of orbits supporting more inner parts of the spiral structure .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "8 where the percentage of orbits starting close to the @xmath125 unstable periodic orbits that stay located inside a radius @xmath126 ( which in fact confines the bound part of the galaxy , @xmath127 being the half mass radius of the system ) is plotted as a function of time in @xmath128 , for four different energy levels ( jacobi constants ) , namely for @xmath129 ( black solid curve ) , @xmath130 ( black dotted curve ) , @xmath131 ( gray curve ) and @xmath132 ( black dashed curve ) .",
    "after 1 hubble time ( @xmath133 ) , @xmath134 of the orbits with @xmath129 is still located inside @xmath135 , while @xmath136 of the orbits with @xmath130 , @xmath137 with @xmath131 and only @xmath138 of the orbits with @xmath132 is still located inside @xmath126 .",

    "the diffusion is slower , and most of the stars remain close to the outer parts of the spiral arms for more than a hubble time .    in the case of chaotic orbits with initial conditions inside corotation or close to it , the diffusion happens quickly for an initial time interval corresponding to @xmath150 1/3 of the hubble time ( during which the spiral structure survives ) , while later on it is very slow ( see fig .",

    "\\3 ) asymptotic orbits ( having initial conditions on the unstable asymptotic curve of an unstable periodic orbit ) stay located close to the periodic orbit for an initial interval of time , following the shape of this specific orbit , before diffusing from it and supporting the spiral structure .",
