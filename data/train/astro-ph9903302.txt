    "an asca observation performed on may 1998 detected 1wgaj1958.2 + 3232  at the flux level expected from the rosat pointing and confirmed the presence of a strong periodic signal at 734@xmath51  s ( israel _ et al .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath0 10@xmath3(@xmath6/1 kpc)@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 in the 210 kev energy band was obtained ( assuming an absorbed power  law model ) . due to the large uncertainty in the period determined by rosat , it was not possible to determine whether the system contains an accreting magnetic white dwarf or a neutron star , based on the period derivative .",
    "even the spectral characteristics were consistent with both scenarios . accreting neutron stars in binary systems are often associated with o  b stars , while cataclysmic variables with k  m main sequence companion stars ; in both cases strong emission ",

    "the observations were performed between may and september 1998 at the loiano astronomical observatory . in order to select objects with peculiar emission  lines , as expected from the companion star of this kind of binary systems , slitless multiobject spectroscopy as described by polcaro & viotti ( 1998 ) was used .",
    "this method allows to obtain a good spectrum for a large number of stars and quickly select stars with strong emission  lines , down to magnitudes of m@xmath1 @xmath8 1618 .",

    "cosmic rays were removed from each image and spectrum and the sky  subtracted stellar spectra were obtained , corrected for atmospheric extinction and flux calibrated ( when possible ) .",

    "note that at the time of the first optical observation only the rosat pspc position uncertainty was known .",
    "photometry for each stellar object in the image was derived with the daophotii package ( stetson @xcite ) , and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) were then computed for all color combinations . by the analysis of the @xmath17-@xmath18 vs. @xmath17 cmd",
    "a well defined main sequence is clearly visible ( fig.2 ) , as expected in an area projected along the galactic plane like the one of 1wgaj1958.2 + 3232  ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , a number of objects with peculiar colors ( redder or bluer ) with respect the bulk of the stars were selected ; three of them ( stars a , b and c ) were found to lie within the rosat position uncertainty region ( see table 1 ) .",

    "the spectrum of star b is similar to those of massive be / x  ray binaries . as usual , a more detailed spectral classification is made more difficult by the fact that most of the classical criteria are unusable , since the h and most of the he lines are in emission and the fe ii complex masks most of the stellar atmospheric features .",
    "however , the presence of n iii , c iii and o ii lines , and the @xmath0 0.1   equivalent width of the mg ii 4481   line suggest a b0 spectral type ( see e.g. jaschek & jaschek , 1987 ) .",
    "the few absorption lines that are clearly visible are wide , thus suggesting a main sequence star . we can thus conclude",
    "that most probably the optical companion of the collapsed object is a b0v star .",
    "the equivalent width @xmath20.5   of the interstellar na ii ( 5890  ) indicates an intermediate reddening ( _ e@xmath21 _ @xmath2 0.6 ; following hobbs , 1974 ) , corresponding , in the cygnus region to a distance of @xmath0 800 pc ( ishida , 1969 ) .",

    "even though the optical data argue against an accreting white dwarf , only a measurement of the spin period derivative will firmly asses the nature of the accreting object . if the system hosts an accreting neutron star , than it would be one of the faintest be / x  ray pulsars .",

    "based on the optical results we obtained for the stars within the error circle of 1wgaj1958.2 + 3232 , we conclude that star b , a b0ve spectral  type star , represents the very likely optical counterpart of 1wgaj1958.2 + 3232 .",
