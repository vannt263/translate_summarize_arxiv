    "h  i gas in the magellanic stream , its leading arms , and the magellanic bridge have long been discussed in the context of dynamical and hydrodynamical interaction between the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) and the galaxy ( e.g. , murai & fujimoto 1980 ; putman et al .",
    "1998 ; mastropietro et al .",
    "2005 ; muller & bekki 2007 ) .",
    "such intense interactions between the three galaxies have been also suggested to be closely associated not only with the long - term star formation histories of the lmc and the smc ( e.g. , harris & zaritsky 2004 ; cioni et al .",
    "2006 ) but also with structural and kinematical properties of the mcs ( e.g. , bekki & chiba 2005 , bc05 ) .",
    "it is however not fully understood how the interactions can change dynamical and chemical properties and star formation histories of the mcs ( e.g. , westerland 1997 ) .    although many previous numerical / theoretical works discussed influences of the galaxy on the evolution of the mc ( e.g. , gardiner & noguchi 1995 ; bc05 ; r. uika et al . 2007 ) , only a few works investigated the possible gravitational influences of the mcs on the dynamical evolution of the galactic _ the stellar disk _ ( e.g. , weinberg 1998 ; tsuchiya 2002 ) and the gaseous one ( weinberg & blitz 2006 ) .",
    "for example , these works discussed whether the observed galactic warp can be due to the dynamical interaction between the lmc and the galaxy ( e.g. , tsuchiya 2002 ) . although previous numerical and observational studies on the ms formation suggested possible interaction between the las and the galaxy ( e.g. , yoshizawa & noguchi 2003 ; brns et al . 2005 ; connors et al .",
    "2006 ) , the details of the interaction processes have not been investigated yet . in particular , it is totally unclear _ how the gaseous components of the galaxy are influenced by the gaseous components of the mcs_.    recent observational studies on the physical properties of the outer h  i disk of the galaxy have reported a significant ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) velocity perturbation in the outer h  i spiral arm of the galaxy at @xmath4 ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2004 , m04 ) .",
    "furthermore , it remains unclear why the outer h  i disk ( @xmath5 kpc ) appears to show significantly lower densities between the galactic longitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see figure 2 in m04 ) .",
    "no theoretical works have however discussed so far the origin of these unique properties in m04 .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show , for the first time , how collision between the las and the galactic h  i disk ( hereafter referred to as `` the magellanic impact '' ) influences the evolution of the galactic h  i disk .",
    "we first show when and how the las can pass through the galactic disk based on our collisionless n - body simulations on the evolution of the mcs for the last 2.5 gyr ( e.g. , bekki & chiba 2007 , bc07 ) .",
    "we then show that the magellanic impact can create unique , kpc - scale h  i holes and chimney - like bridges connecting the las and the outer part of the galactic h  i disk based on new yet somewhat idealized hydrodynamical simulations on the magellanic impact .",
    "the present investigation is two - fold as follows .",
    "we first investigate when and where the las can pass through the galaxy during the lmc - smc - galaxy interaction based on purely collisionless n - body simulations similar to our previous ones ( bc07 ) . in this first investigation ,",
    "we focus exclusively on the locations and the masses of the las at the epochs of las passage through the galactic disk , because previous models did not clearly describe these .",
    "we then investigate how the magellanic impact influences the outer part of the galactic h  i disk for a reasonable set of initial conditions of the magellanic impact derived by the above first investigation by using our new hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "since numerical methods and techniques for the first collisionless n - body simulations and the second grape - sph ones are already given in bc07 and bekki & chiba ( 2006 ) , respectively , we here briefly describe them .",
    "we first determine the most plausible and realistic orbits of the mcs by using `` the backward integration scheme '' ( for orbital evolution of the mcs ) by murai & fujimoto ( 1980 ) for the last 2.5 gyr and then perform the first set of collisionless n - body simulations on the evolution of the mcs using grape systems ( sugimoto et al.1990 ) .",
    "the total masses of the lmc and the smc are set to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , in all models .",
    "the smc is represented by a fully self - consistent dynamical model composed of a dark matter halo , a stellar disk or spheroid , and a gas disk whereas the lmc is represented by a point mass .",
    "the mass fraction of the baryonic component ( i.e. , stars and gas ) and the gas mass fraction of the baryon in the smc are considered to be free parameters and represented by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . the ratio ( @xmath12 ) of the gas disk size ( @xmath13 ) to the stellar one ( @xmath14 ) in the smc is also considered to be a free parameter that can effect the morphologies of the ms and the las . although we have investigated models with different @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath12 , we focus on the results of a la model with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 kpc , and @xmath18 : results of the other models will be given in our future papers ( bekki & chiba in preparation ) .",
    "this model is simply referred to as the la model .",
    "we use the same coordinate system @xmath19 ( in units of kpc ) as those used in bc05 and bc07 .",
    "the adopted current positions are @xmath20 for the lmc and @xmath21 for the smc and the adopted current galactocentric radial velocity of the lmc ( smc ) is 80 ( 7 ) km s@xmath3 .",
    "current velocities of the lmc and the smc in the galactic ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) coordinate are assumed to be ( -5,-225,194 ) and ( 40,-185,171 ) in units of km s@xmath3 , respectively . as shown by previous studies ( e.g. , gardiner & noguchi 1995 ) ,",
    "the ms and the las can be formed for the adopted orbits of the mc .",
    "we do not intend to investigate the models with initial velocities consistent with the latest proper motion data ( e.g. , kallivayalil et al .",
    "we investigate the accretion rate ( @xmath25 ) of the smc s gas particles initially in the la onto the outer part of the galaxy , the total masses of the las passing though the galactic disk ( @xmath26 ) , the epochs of the passage ( @xmath27 ) , and the inclination angles of the las with respect to the galactic disk at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we investigate hydrodynamical interaction between the las and the outer part of the galactic h  i disk for models with different initial properties of the las ( e.g. , @xmath26 and @xmath29 ) derived by the first set of collisionless simulations of the la formation . in this second set of grape - sph simulations , the gaseous stream of the la",
    "is assumed to be represented by a long `` tube '' with a size of @xmath30 , a length of @xmath31 , a mass of @xmath26 , a position ( with respect to the galactic center ) of @xmath32 , an inclination angle of @xmath29 , and a velocity of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we adopt the ring model ( bc06 ) for the outer part ( 20 kpc @xmath35 40 kpc ) of the galactic h  i disk with a uniform distribution so that we can focus solely on the evolution of _ the outer part _ of the galactic h  i disk during the magellanic impact . considering the observational",
    "fact that the total h  i mass of the galaxy is about @xmath36 ( e.g. , van der kruit 1989 ) , the total gas mass of the ring for 20 kpc @xmath35 40 kpc is assumed to be @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that the size of the stellar disk of the galaxy ( @xmath38 ) is 17.5 kpc and that the galaxy is composed only of gas outside @xmath38 .",
    "we here discuss the results of two representative models , model a and b , among those that we have investigated .",
    "firstly we show the result of the model a with @xmath39 kpc , @xmath40 kpc , @xmath41 , @xmath32=(31.5 kpc , 0 kpc , -10.5 kpc ) , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 km s@xmath3 in  3 .",
    "we chose the above @xmath32 so that we can show more clearly the evolution of the outer part of the galactic disk projected onto the @xmath44-@xmath45 and @xmath44-@xmath46 planes : the adopted values are slightly different from the predicted locations of the la .",
    "we then discuss the results of the model b with @xmath39 kpc , @xmath47 kpc , @xmath48 , @xmath32=(21.0 kpc , -15.8 kpc , -10.5 kpc ) , @xmath42 , and @xmath49 km s@xmath3 in  4 .",
    "this model can reproduce best the observations by m04 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the las composed mainly of two gaseous streams can pass through the galactic plane about 0.2 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath50 gyr ) in the la model .",
    "the high - density tip of the la passes through the outer part ( @xmath51 kpc ) of the galaxy with a high @xmath29 ( the inclination angle between the la and the galactic plane ) and a high vertical velocity of @xmath52 km s@xmath3 .",
    "about 1.4 % of the inital gas particles of the smc can pass though the outer region ( @xmath53 ) for the last @xmath54 gyr and the vertical velocities ( @xmath55 ) of the gas particles in the las are rather high and range from 186 km s@xmath3 to 317 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath56 reaches a peak at @xmath57 gyr with the peak value of @xmath58 yr@xmath3 .",
    "it is found that the projected distribution of particles passing through the galactic disk at @xmath57 gyr are well confined in the sense that most particles are located at @xmath59 kpc @xmath60 @xmath61 kpc and at @xmath62 kpc @xmath63 @xmath64 kpc .",
    "figure 2 shows how the magellanic impact changes the vertical structure of the outer part of the galactic gas disk in the model a. although the magellanic impact can not change the global structure of the galactic gas disk ( e.g. , warps and spiral arms ) owing to the adopted small mass of the la ( @xmath41 ) , it can push out a small fraction @xmath1% ) of the gas disk and form chimney - like bridges connecting the la and the galaxy .",
    "the bridges can be seen above the galactic disk ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) not only in this model a but also in other models , which is thus a robust prediction that can be tested against ongoing and future h  i observations ( e.g. , m04 and mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2006 , m06 ) .",
    "the gaseous particles in the bridges for 2 kpc @xmath66 10 kpc at @xmath67 myr have large ( positive ) vertical velocities ( @xmath68 km s@xmath3 on average ) that are significantly different from those of the particles within the galactic h  i disk .",
    "figure 3 shows that as a result of the magellanic impact , a giant h  i hole with a size of @xmath2 kpc can be formed in the outer part ( @xmath69 kpc ) of the galactic h  i disk",
    ". the h  i hole can be neither destroyed nor significantly elongated owing to the shear motion of the galactic gas disk within a time scale of 0.2 gyr ( i.e. , the time interval between the magellanic impact and the present ) so that it can be clearly seen in the final snapshot of the model .",
    "only the right part of the hole ( i.e. , @xmath70 kpc and @xmath71 kpc ) clearly shows a ridge with a significantly higher gas density ( @xmath72 pc@xmath73 ) .",
    "such giant h  i holes in the very _ outer _ part of the galaxy are highly unlikely to form via feedback effects of massive stars and supernovae , because the rate of massive star formation at large radii is very low in such low density regions .",
    "the surface gas densities along azimuthal angles ( @xmath74 ) averaged over a range of 30 kpc @xmath75",
    "@xmath76 @xmath75 40 kpc in the galactic disk are found to range from @xmath77 pc@xmath73 to @xmath78 pc@xmath73 with the mean of @xmath74 being @xmath79 pc@xmath73 in this model .",
    "the minimum value is found where the giant h  i hole exists , which suggests that the line - of - sight column density ( with respect to the sun ) in the direction to an h  i hole can be a factor of @xmath80 smaller than those in other directions .",
    "we discuss these results in terms of observations by m04 later in  4 .",
    "we confirm that the models with @xmath81 do not show any kpc - scale holes with remarkable chimney - like structures owing to the rather weak dynamical impacts of the la on the galactic h  i disk .",
    "we first have shown that the magellanic impact can create 10kpc - scale h  i holes and bridges connecting the la and the galaxy .",
    "the physical properties of the simulated unique structures in the outer part ( @xmath82 kpc ) of the galactic gas disk can be tested against previous and ongoing observational studies on h  i properties of the galaxy ( e.g. , m04 ; levine et al .",
    "2006 ; m06 ) .",
    "although detailed comparison of ongoing and future observations will be given in our future papers , here we briefly discuss previous observations shown in figures 1 and 2 of m04 compared to the model b in a more quantitative manner .",
    "figure 4 clearly shows the longitude - velocity ( @xmath83 ) diagram of particles of the galactic gas disk in the model b , where @xmath84 denotes the line - of - sight velocities of the particles with respect to the sun . clearly the @xmath83 diagram shows a bifurcation around at @xmath85 , the most clearly at @xmath86 .",
    "this bifurcation is due to the dynamically disturbed gas disk of the galaxy by the magellanic impact and may correspond to a part of the observed significant ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) velocity perturbation in the outer h  i spiral arm of the galaxy at @xmath4 ( see figure 1 of m04 ) .",
    "figure 4 also shows a significantly less populated region at @xmath85 in the particle distribution on the @xmath87 ) plane owing to the presence of the giant h  i hole there created by the magellanic impact .",
    "this is broadly consistent with observations shown in figure 2 of m04 , which shows that the outer h  i disk of the galaxy shows significantly lower densities between the galactic longitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "velocities of particles pushed out from the galactic plane can be more than 50 km s@xmath3 higher than those within the galactic disk in figure 4 , which can not be seen in figure 1 of m04 .",
    "this apparent inconsistency possibly means that such high - velocity gas with low - density and low - mass ( @xmath88 ) can be soon changed into ionized gas owing to possible interaction with warm / hot halo gas of the galaxy so that it can not be observed as h  i. although the observed @xmath83 diagram in m04 does not clearly show bifurcation , the h  i seems to be distributed on two belts for @xmath89 and @xmath90 60 km s@xmath3 .",
    "it remains observationally unclear whether this intriguing distribution can correspond to a bifurcated distribution of h  i on the @xmath83 diagram .",
    "the direction of the orbit of the la ( with respect to the galaxy ) can significantly change at the galactic plane ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) as a result of hydrodynamical interaction between the la and the galactic h  i disk .",
    "the orbital change at @xmath91 due to the back reaction of the magellanic impact can explain why the observed distribution of the la in the galactic coordinate shows a `` kink '' at @xmath91 ( e.g. , brns et al .",
    "furthermore the total h  i mass of the la can be significantly reduced by photoionization of the h  i gas of the la by the warm gas of the galactic disk during the magellanic impact .",
    "this significant reduction of the h  i mass in the la can solve the well known problem as to the observed small mass ratio ( @xmath92 ) of the la to the ms ( e.g. , brns et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is possible that the magellanic impact can trigger some amount of star formation in the outer part of the galactic gas disk owing to collisions between gas clouds from the galaxy and those from the la .",
    "we thus suggest that the presence ( or the absence ) of b - type stars with ages of @xmath93 gyr at @xmath94 and @xmath95 would prove ( or disprove ) the past star formation activities of the galaxy induced by the magellanic impact .",
    "we also suggest that hydrodynamical interactions between gaseous tidal tails and debris from disrupting low - mass galaxies ( like the smc ) and outer parts of galactic h  i disks can be proved by observations on detailed spatial distributions of h  i in galaxies .",
    "in particular , future structural and kinematical studies on the observed giant h  i holes in the very outer parts of galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 6822 ; de blok & walater 2003 ) will allow us to discuss whether or not hydrodynamical interaction between gaseous tidal tails and outer gas disks of galaxies can be important for the evolution of the outer disks .",
