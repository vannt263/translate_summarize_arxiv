    "this star can not be explained by normal stellar interactions : the maximum ejection velocity from binary disruption mechanisms @xcite is limited to @xmath4300 km s@xmath3 for 3 m@xmath1 stars @xcite .",
    "although runaways may reach unbound velocities for very massive stars , like the hyper - runaway hd 271791 @xcite , runaway ejection velocities are constrained by the properties of binary stars .",

    "the observational signature of a hvs is its unbound velocity .",
    "although not all unbound stars are necessarily hvss  fast - moving pulsars , for example , are explained by supernova kicks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  unbound low mass main sequence stars are most plausibly explained as hvss .",

    "discovering lower - mass hvss should provide constraints on the stellar mass function of hvss @xcite ; the velocity distribution of low- versus high - mass hvss may discriminate between a single mbh or binary mbh origin @xcite .",
    "our survey strategy targets stars fainter and redder than the original hvs survey .",
    "this strategy is successful : we report the discovery of 6 unbound hvss and 4 possibly unbound hvss .",
    "observers have identified a remarkable number of hvss in the past 3 years . following the discovery of the first hvs @xcite",

    "the star hvs3 ( he 0437 - 5439 ) , the unbound hvs very near the lmc on the sky , has received the most attention .",
    "hvs3 is a 9 m@xmath9 b star of half - solar abundance , a good match to the abundance of the lmc @xcite",
    ". stellar abundance may not be conclusive evidence of origin , however .",
    "a- and b - type stars exhibit 0.5 - 1 dex scatter in elemental abundances within a single cluster , due to gravitational settling and radiative levitation in the atmospheres of the stars @xcite .",
    "an lmc origin requires that hvs3 was ejected from the galaxy at @xmath61000 km s@xmath3 @xcite , a velocity that can possibly come from three - body interactions with an intermediate mass black hole in a massive star cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that the ejection rate of 9 m@xmath1 stars , however , is four orders of magnitude too small for this explanation to be plausible .",
    "the alternative explanation is that hvs3 is a blue straggler , ejected by the milky way s mbh .",
    "theorists argue that a single mbh or a binary mbh can eject a compact binary star as a hvs @xcite ; the subsequent evolution of such a compact binary can result in mass - transfer and/or a merger that can possibly explain hvs3 @xcite .",
    "proper motion measurements , underway now , will determine hvs3 s origin .",

    "we discuss a possible bhb star among the hvss .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "hvss are rare : our discoveries imply there are @xmath15 hvss of mass 3 - 4 m@xmath9 within 100 kpc @xcite .",
    "thus to find new hvss we must target luminous objects over a very large volume .",
    "luminous o- and b - type hvss , even if they lived long enough to be observed , would be lost behind a large foreground of hot white dwarfs with identical colors , @xmath16 .",
    "we design our new hvs survey to target early a - type stars .",
    "known hvss are located at distances 50 - 100 kpc , corresponding to @xmath17 for early a - type stars . at such magnitudes ,",
    "fewer than @xmath6100 a - type stars have published radial velocities @xcite .",
    "halo bhb and blue straggler stars are a major contaminant at faint magnitudes , but fortunately the density of the stellar halo falls off very steeply .",
    "@xcite calculate the density profile of unbound hvss is approximately @xmath18 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the density profile of the stellar halo is closer to @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus we maximize the contrast of hvss with respect to indigenous halo stars by restricting ourselves to the faintest a - stars .",
    "we select candidate hvss in the magnitude range @xmath20 .",
    "the faint limit is set by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric errors , which approach @xmath21 in @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "the bright limit is set to provide continuity with our original hvs survey , although we impose a more stringent bright limit on the reddest stars @xmath24 + [ ( u'-g')_0-(1.2(g'-r')_0 + 1.25)]$ ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "we use a combination of @xmath22 and @xmath27 colors to select stars with probable high surface gravity , and thus maximize the chance of finding main sequence hvss .",
    "figure [ fig : ugr ] illustrates the color selection .",
    "the original hvs survey ( dashed line ) was designed to avoid the locus of bhb / a - type stars ; our new hvs survey ( long dashed line ) follows the @xcite main sequence tracks for solar abundance stars ( solid lines ) down to @xmath62 m@xmath9 a - stars .",
    "known hvss scatter uniformly around the main sequence tracks .",
    "known bhb stars @xcite , on the other hand , are systematically redder in @xmath22 .",
    "we select stars with @xmath28 to avoid the majority of known halo bhb stars ( figure [ fig : ugr ] ) .",
    "we select stars with @xmath29 to include 3 m@xmath9 stars that can viably travel 150 kpc ( = 20.5 mag ) in their main sequence lifetimes .",
    "finally , we impose @xmath30 and @xmath31 to exclude non - stellar objects , such as quasars .",
    "notably , this color selection includes the first hvs , that was not formally a part of the original hvs survey .    applying this color - magnitude selection to the sdss dr6 photometric catalog results in 528 hvs candidates spread over 7300 deg@xmath32 .",
    "we have excluded the small region of the sdss between @xmath33 and @xmath34 to avoid excessive contamination from galactic bulge stars .",
    "of the 528 hvs candidates , 59 were previously observed as part of our original hvs survey @xcite , and 21 are in the @xcite bhb catalog .",
    "thus we need spectra for 448 hvs candidates .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained at the 6.5 m mmt telescope with the blue channel spectrograph on the nights of 2008 february 6 - 10 and 2008 may 7 - 11 .",
    "we operated the spectrograph with the 832 line mm@xmath3 grating in second order and a 1.25@xmath35 slit .",
    "these settings provide wavelength coverage 3650   to 4500   and a spectral resolution of 1.2  .",
    "all observations were obtained at the parallactic angle .",
    "our goal was to obtain modest signal - to - noise ( @xmath36 ) observations adequate for determining radial velocity .",
    "we typically obtained @xmath37 in the continuum at 4000   in a 10 minute integration on a @xmath38 star .",
    "we obtained spectra for 233 hvs candidates , and processed the data in real - time to allow additional observations of interesting candidates .",
    "we extracted the spectra using iraf in the standard way and measured radial velocities using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "the average radial velocity uncertainty of the @xmath37 spectra is @xmath39 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we now have spectroscopic identifications and radial velocities for 313 ( 59% ) of the 528 hvs candidates .",
    "19 of the objects are newly identified @xmath0 quasars , and 9 of the objects are da white dwarfs .",
    "we present the quasars and white dwarfs in appendix a. the remaining 285 objects have the spectra of early a- and late b - type stars .",
    "in addition , we observed the final 40 objects remaining in the original hvs survey @xcite .",
    "because our new and original hvs surveys cover contiguous regions of color - magnitude space over the same region of sky , we consider the results of the combined surveys in this paper .",
    "we exclude stars with @xmath40 that are possibly associated with the inner halo ; the inner halo has distinctly different kinematics from the outer halo @xcite .",
    "we also exclude all white dwarfs , quasars , and b supergiants .",
    "our combined hvs survey contains 759 non - kinematically - selected stars @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : hist ] plots the distribution of line - of - sight velocities , corrected to the galactic rest - frame ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for the combined sample of 759 stars .",
    "the 731 survey stars with @xmath42 km s@xmath3 have a @xmath43 km s@xmath3 mean and a @xmath44 km s@xmath3 dispersion , consistent with a normal stellar halo population .",
    "notably , there are 28 stars in the tails of the distribution with @xmath45 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we observe 26 stars with @xmath46 km s@xmath3 and only 2 stars with @xmath47 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the escape velocity of the milky way at 50 kpc is @xmath48 km s@xmath3 @xcite , thus the 12 stars with @xmath49 km s@xmath3 are unbound . ignoring the 12 unbound stars , there is less than a @xmath50 probability of randomly drawing 14 stars with @xmath51 km s@xmath3 from the tail of a gaussian distribution with the observed parameters .",
    "thus the excess of positive velocity outliers @xmath51 km s@xmath3 appears significant at the 4-@xmath52 level .",
    "the positive velocity outliers demonstrate a population of short - lived hvss ejected onto bound trajectories @xcite .",
    "hvs ejection mechanisms naturally produce a broad spectrum of ejection velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of hvs ejections from the hills mechanism suggest there should be comparable numbers of unbound and bound hvss with @xmath53 km s@xmath3 in our survey volume @xcite .",
    "as shown below , we find 14 unbound hvss and 12 possibly bound hvss with @xmath53 km s@xmath3 , in good agreement with model predictions .",
    "following @xcite , we define hvss by 1 ) their mbh origin and 2 ) their unbound velocities . an hvs ejected from the milky way travels on a nearly radial trajectory ; the expected proper motion for a 50 kpc distant hvs is a few tenths of a milliarcsecond per year ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus radial velocity directly measures most of a hvs s space motion . deciding whether a hvs is unbound",
    ", however , requires knowledge of the star s distance .",
    "we estimate distances to the hvss assuming they are main sequence stars .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the significant absence of stars falling back onto the galaxy around @xmath54 km s@xmath3 ( figure [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "bound hvss must have main sequence lifetimes less than @xmath61 gyr , otherwise we would see them falling back onto the galaxy @xcite . given the color - selection of our survey ( figure [ fig : ugr ] ) ,",
    "the a- and b - type hvss must be 2 - 4 m@xmath9 main sequence stars at galactocentric distances @xmath55 kpc ( figure [ fig : colmags ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the galactic potential is poorly constrained at distances @xmath55 kpc .",
    "we consider two galactic potential models here .",
    "@xcite discuss a spherically symmetric potential that , for the first time , fits the milky way mass distribution from 5 pc to 10@xmath56 pc . because the form of the potential does not yield a true escape velocity , @xcite define unbound stars as having @xmath57 km s@xmath3 at @xmath58 kpc .",
    "this conservative definition yields a galactic escape velocity of 360 km s@xmath3 at 50 kpc and 260 km s@xmath3 at 100 kpc ( figure [ fig : travel ] ) .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , fit a halo potential model to the velocity dispersion of 2466 bhb stars located 5 kpc @xmath59 kpc .",
    "the escape velocity resulting from the @xcite model is 290 km s@xmath3 at 50 kpc and 190 km s@xmath3 at 100 kpc ( figure [ fig : travel ] ) .",
    "not all unbound stars are hvss .",
    "the star hd 271791 is the first example of an unbound `` hyper - runaway '' that was ejected from the outer disk , in the direction of galactic rotation , when its former 55 m@xmath1 binary companion exploded as a supernova @xcite .",
    "objects ejected in this manner are traditionally called runaways @xcite .",
    "the term runaway also includes stars dynamically ejected from binary - binary encounters @xcite .",
    "we investigate here the possible contribution of runaways to the population of hvss .",
    "first , we consider the properties of binaries required to produce unbound hyper - runaways .",
    "then , we consider the production rate of stars massive enough to produce these hyper - runaways .",
    "both the supernova and binary - binary ejection mechanisms share a common velocity constraint : the physical properties of binary stars . theoretically , the maximum ejection velocity from disrupting a binary ( e.g. , by a supernova ) is the binary orbital velocity .",
    "the maximum ejection velocity from dynamical binary - binary encounters is the escape velocity of the most massive star , which for stars on the upper main sequence is @xmath60 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this theoretical maximum ejection velocity is not realizable , however , because compact binaries that are too tight will merge instead of producing a runaway .    to avoid merging ,",
    "a compact binary must avoid losing too much energy from roche lobe overflow and from tidal dissipation .",
    "stars with separations less than 2.5 @xmath61 overfill their roche lobes and quickly merge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during close binary encounters",
    ", tidal dissipation can lead to mergers of compact binaries @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are especially problematic for binaries involving a supernova .",
    "when a massive primary star evolves ( prior to exploding ) , it experiences significant mass loss .",
    "dynamical friction from the primary s wind causes the secondary star to quickly in - spiral , thus conserving the angular momentum of the system @xcite .",
    "a minimum binary separation must be chosen to prevent mergers .",
    "unfortunately , the details of tidal dissipation and stellar merging are uncertain . thus we make only optimistic assumptions in our estimate of hyper - runaway ejection rates .      in the context of our hvss",
    ", a runaway must have a velocity exceeding 400 km s@xmath3 to be confused with a hvs .",
    "the orbital velocity of the secondary star in a binary is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the separation of the two stars , @xmath64 is the mass ratio , and @xmath65 is the orbital period .",
    "we insert kepler s third law @xmath66 into equation [ eqn : vsec ] , set @xmath67 km s@xmath3 , and find that the progenitor binary system must have @xmath68 to produce a @xmath69400 km s@xmath3 runaway . here",
    ", @xmath70 is the total mass of the binary .",
    "we will optimistically assume that the secondary fills its roche - lobe and has a radius of @xmath60.4@xmath63 .",
    "because a 3 m@xmath1 star has a 3 r@xmath1 radius , a binary must have @xmath71 r@xmath1 and a primary star with mass @xmath6910 m@xmath1 to produce the requisite 3 m@xmath1 runaway ejected at @xmath69400 km s@xmath3 ( equation [ eqn : ma ] ) .",
    "known hvss have travel times spanning 200 myr ( see figure [ fig : travel ] ) .",
    "the star formation rate in the solar neighborhood is 0.5 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath72 m@xmath1 of stars have formed in the disk in the past 200 myr .",
    "a standard salpeter initial mass function @xcite , integrated from 0.1 m@xmath1 to 100 m@xmath1 and normalized to @xmath72 m@xmath1 , predicts @xmath73 stars with masses 10 - 100 m@xmath1 .",
    "all o and b stars are in binaries , and a third of the binaries are twins @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath74 of massive primaries are not twins . assuming the secondaries have a salpeter mass function @xcite , there are @xmath6600 secondaries with mass 3 - 4 m@xmath1 . given a log - normal distribution of binary separations , @xmath65% of binaries have 8 - 20 r@xmath1 semi - major axes enabling a @xmath69400 km s@xmath3 ejection .",
    "thus we expect @xmath630 3 - 4 m@xmath1 runaways ejected at @xmath69400 km s@xmath3 in the past 200 myr .",
    "the galactic disk has an exponential stellar density profile with radial scale length 2.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "thus the region of the outer disk @xmath75 kpc , despite containing most of the disk s area , contains no more than 10% of the disk s stars if we optimistically normalize the density over @xmath76 kpc .",
    "thus we predict only @xmath63 possible 3 - 4 m@xmath1 hyper - runaways ejected from the outer disk in the past 200 myr .",
    "however , potential models of the milky way show that a star traveling with 400 km s@xmath3 in the region @xmath75 kpc is bound ( see figure [ fig : travel ] ) . to achieve an unbound velocity",
    ", a runaway must be ejected at 400 km s@xmath3 in the direction of galactic rotation . assuming that runaways are ejected in random directions , no more than 10% of ejections will be in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "thus we predict @xmath60.3 hyper - runaways with mass 3 - 4 m@xmath1 were ejected in the past 200 myr , preferentially found at low galactic latitudes .",
    "the ejection rate from binary - binary encounters is even smaller , because it depends on the joint probability of colliding two compact binaries .",
    "a cluster of @xmath77 stars following a salpeter mass function contains 330 3 - 4 m@xmath9 stars and 190 10 - 100 m@xmath9 stars .",
    "we optimistically assume that the 330 3 - 4 m@xmath9 stars are in 330 different binaries , and that the 10 - 100 m@xmath9 stars are in 130 binaries ( because a third of them are twins , * ? ? ?",
    ". a log - normal distribution of binary separation suggests that @xmath65% of the binaries have 8 - 20 r@xmath1 semi - major axes enabling a @xmath69400 km s@xmath3 ejection .",
    "this reduces the number of relevant binaries containing 3 - 4 m@xmath9 and 10 - 100 m@xmath9 stars to 17 and 7 , respectively .",
    "if mass segregation puts all of the compact binaries in the central 0.1 pc , then the space density of compact binaries containing a 10 - 100 m@xmath9 star is 2@xmath78 pc@xmath79 .",
    "if we assume a velocity dispersion of 1 km s@xmath3 and a cross - section for collision of @xmath80 r@xmath9 , then the ejection rate of 3 - 4 m@xmath1 @xmath69400 km s@xmath3 runaways is @xmath6@xmath81 myr@xmath3 per cluster . because 10 m@xmath9 stars live @xmath620 myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus the velocities in table [ tab : hvs ] may vary slightly from earlier work .    we do not report errors in table [ tab : hvs ] because formal uncertainties are misleadingly small compared to the ( unknown ) systematic errors .",

    "the luminosity estimates are precise at the 10% level for main sequence stars",
    ". however , the luminosity estimates could be over - estimated by an order of magnitude for post - main sequence stars .",

    "the identification of hvss as main sequence stars is in stark contrast to the halo stars in our survey , which are , presumably , evolved 0.6 - 1 m@xmath1 stars on the bhb .",

    "applying the @xcite surface gravity measures to the new hvss , hvs12 is a possible bhb star .",
    "the line width - shape technique indicates hvs12 has low surface gravity , although the @xmath131-color technique is ambiguous because of hvs12 s blue @xmath132 color .",
    "if hvs12 is a bhb star with [ fe / h]@xmath133 , then it has @xmath94(bhb)@xmath134 @xcite and is located at @xmath135 kpc .",

    "interestingly , hvs12 was previously classified as a bhb star by @xcite . @xcite",

    "have recently re - analyzed the sdss bhb sample and combined it with additional targeted observations from the segue survey .",
    "@xcite classify hvs12 as a possible bhb star , but exclude it from the their rigorously selected bhb sample .",
    "high @xmath36 spectroscopy and photometry is required to confirm the nature of hvs12 .",
    "although hvs12 is a clear outlier in the velocity distribution of bhb stars ( see figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hvs12 was not previously recognized as an unbound star .",
    "the median depth of the @xcite sample is @xmath137 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath620 kpc for a bhb star ( see figure [ fig : colmags ] ) .",
    "a star with @xmath138 km s@xmath3 at the median depth of the @xcite sample is thus bound .",
    "what appears to have escaped notice , however , is that hvs12 is fainter , and bluer , than 96% of the @xcite bhb sample .",
    "figure [ fig : colmags ] compares the distribution of stars in our hvs surveys and the @xcite bhb sample in a color - magnitude diagram . for reference",
    ", we draw lines of constant distance for main sequence stars with solar abundance ( solid lines , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for halo bhb stars with [ fe / h]@xmath139 ( dashed lines , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the color - magnitude selection of the new hvs survey is such that every star has @xmath14040 kpc , whether a main sequence star or a bhb star ( figure [ fig : colmags ] ) .",
    "the presence of only one hvs among the 1170 @xcite bhb stars and the 10224 @xcite bhb candidates shows the immense dilution due to stars in the galactic halo .",
    "it is important to minimize contamination from foreground stellar populations when looking for hvss .",
    "our surveys find hvss because we target stars that are bluer and/or fainter than the bulk of halo bhb stars .",
    "we describe a new targeted hvs survey , a spectroscopic survey of faint stars @xmath141 with early a - type and late b - type colors .",
    "recent observations confirm that 3 of our b - type hvss are 3 - 4 m@xmath1 main sequence stars .",
    "the observational signature of a hvs is its unbound velocity , which we determine by comparing observed radial velocities and distances to galactic potential models .",
    "we argue that the known properties of binaries and the rarity of massive stars make hyper - runaways like hd 271791 rare .",
    "a mbh ejection remains the most plausible origin of unbound low - mass stars .",
    "our hvs survey is 59% complete and , combined with our original hvs survey , shows a remarkable velocity distribution : 26 stars with @xmath53 km s@xmath3 and only 2 stars with @xmath47 km s@xmath3 . here",
    "we report the discovery of 6 new unbound hvss in excess of the conservative escape velocity model of @xcite , and 4 additional unbound hvss in excess of the escape velocity model of @xcite .",
    "one of the new hvss may be an evolved bhb star .",
    "the @xcite ejection models predict bhb hvss are @xmath610 times less abundant than the main sequence hvss in our survey , consistent with the existence of @xmath142 bhb stars in our hvs sample .",
    "of course , the exact number of bhb hvss depends on the mass function of stars near the central mbh .",
    "bhb hvss therefore have the potential to probe the low - mass regime of hvss and constrain the mass function of stars in the galactic center .",
    "hvss are fascinating because their properties are tied to the nature and environment of the mbh that ejects them @xcite , and their trajectories probe the dark matter halo through which they move @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of hvss on the sky reveals significant anisotropy that may also be related to the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal is to find a statistical sample of @xmath6100 hvss to measure the distribution of hvs properties and discriminate hvs ejection models .",
