    "fundamental determination of stellar masses from binary orbits is a most classical astrophysical discipline , last comprehensively reviewed by andersen ( 1991 ; 1998 ) . besides defining a mean mass - luminosity relation , used at many places in astronomy to approximately convert the observable stellar light to the underlying mass ( for instance to derive an initial mass function ) , accurate stellar masses in multiple systems",
    "provide what is perhaps the most demanding and fundamental test of stellar evolution theory ( e.g. andersen 1991 ) .",
    "mass , the basic input of evolutionary models , is directly measured and the models must reproduce the effective temperatures and radii ( or luminosities ) of both components , for a single age and a single chemical composition . given the strong dependence of all stellar parameters on mass , this discriminating diagnostic however only shows its power for relative mass errors @xmath01 - 2% . in practice",
    "this has up to now restricted its use to double - lined detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "these systems are however relatively rare : only 44 have yielded masses accurate enough to be included in andersen s ( 1991 ) critical compilation , and few have appeared in the literature since then .",
    "tidally induced rotational mixing may in addition affect the evolution of the short period eclipsing systems , perhaps sufficiently that they are not completely representative of isolated stars .",
    "more seriously however , detached eclipsing systems poorly fill some interesting areas in the hr diagram .",
    "the lower main sequence is one major region with very few known eclipsing systems , as a result of the strong observational and intrinsic biases against observing eclipses in faint and physically small stars .",
    "only three well detached eclipsing binaries are known with significantly subsolar component masses : yy gem ( m0ve , 0.6 + 0.6 ; bopp 1974 ; leung & schneider 1978 ) , cm dra ( m4ve , 0.2 + 0.2 ; lacy 1977 , metcalfe et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the recently identified gj  2069a ( m3.5ve , 0.4 + 0.4 ; delfosse et al .",
    "detailed observational checks of evolutionary models ( e.g. paczynski & sienkiewicz 1984 ; chabrier & baraffe 1995 ) have therefore heavily relied on the first two of these systems , even though they are in some respects non - ideal for this purpose : both binaries have two nearly equal mass components , so that the strength of the differential comparison of two stars with different masses but otherwise equal parameters is largely lost . also , all three are chromospherically very active , due to tidal synchronisation of their rotation with the short orbital period . as a consequence",
    ", they may have untypical colours for their bolometric luminosity .",
    "angularly resolved spectroscopic binaries provide stellar masses in parts of the hr diagram where eclipsing systems are missing , though to date these systems have not matched the @xmath11% accuracy which can be obtained in detached eclipsing systems . for m dwarfs in particular , the best representation to date of the empirical m - l relation ( henry & mc  carthy 1993 , hereafter hmcc ; henry , franz , wasserman et al . , 1999 ) still has to rely in part on some fairly noisy mass determinations . for several years ( perrier et al .",
    "1992 ) we have therefore been following up with high angular resolution some low mass spectroscopic systems found with the coravel or elodie radial velocity spectrographs .",
    "this follow - up initially used one - dimensional ( 1d ) ir speckle , then two - dimensional ( 2d ) ir speckle , and now uses adaptive optics imaging .",
    "as a progress report on this program and as an illustration of our methods , we present here much improved parameters for the double - lined interferometric binary gl  570bc .",
    "the @xmath11% accuracy for the 2 masses improves by an order of magnitude on our earlier measurements ( mariotti et al .",
    "1990 ) of this system , and is getting close to what is obtainable for eclipsing systems .",
    "the gl  570 system comprises the _",
    "v_=5.7 k4v star gl  570a ( also hr  5568 , hd  131977 , hip  73184 , fk5 1391 ) , and at a projected distance of 25@xmath2 the close gl  570bc pair ( also hd 131976 , hip  73182 ) which is the subject of the present paper . as discussed below , the orbital period of the close pair is fairly short , only 10  months .",
    "thanks to its small distance of only 6  pc it is nonetheless usually well resolved by the diffraction limit of 4m - class telescopes . the separation within gl  570bc on the other hand always remains less than 0.2@xmath2 , so that all seeing - limited mesurements refer to integrated properties of the close pair .",
    "its integrated magnitude is _",
    "v_=8.09 , and its joint spectral type is m1v ( henry et al .",
    "1994 ; reid et al .",
    "the three components have common parallax , proper motion , and radial velocity .",
    "they are therefore gravitationnally bound , with the projected separation of the wide pair ( about 120  au at the distance of the system ) corresponding to p  @xmath1  500  years .",
    "formation of the system could either result from the fragmentation of a single gas clump or have involved some capture(s ) .",
    "the latter process however only remains efficient at the high densities which characterize very rich star forming clusters , whose lifetimes are very much shorter than the hydrogen burning timescale in a k4 dwarf . for all practical purposes , the three stars can thus in both cases be considered as coeval and as formed from the same gas .",
    "a variety of astrometric observations of different kinds and of different quality have been collected for gliese  570bc over the years .",
    "the close pair was first resolved by mariotti et al .",
    "( 1990 ) who obtained infrared 1d speckle observations on three occasions and derived a first visual orbit .",
    "we refer to their paper for the description of the instrument and the observing and data reduction procedures .",
    "hmcc later measured gl  570bc once with a 2d infrared speckle instrument . for readers convenience , we list these published measurements in table  [ tab_oa ] together with our new 2d speckle and adaptive optics ( hereafter ao ) observations .",
    "two measurements were obtained in february 1991 and april 1991 using the speckle mode of the 2d infrared imagers then installed respectively at the kpno 4.2 m telescope and the cfht 3.6 m telescope .",
    "each imager was designed to permit acquisition of exposures short enough to substantially freeze the seeing under standard atmospheric conditions ( @xmath3 50 to 100  ms ) in bands _",
    "h _ and _ k _ , independently of the overhead due to read - out time and data transfer time .",
    "several sequences of a few hundred such short exposures were obtained , alternating every few minutes between the source and a nearby unresolved star ( usually gl  570a ) used as a point spread function ( psf ) calibrator .",
    "the whole observation took one hour or less .    in principle , this observing procedure allows an almost simultaneous psf calibration , and consequently estimates the visibility modulus with 1 to 5% accuracy .",
    "we used a software package written specifically for this type of data reduction by e. tessier ( tessier et al .",
    "it produces an unbiased visibility estimator for the source and then extracts the binary parameters and their estimated variance from this visibility .",
    "the actual detector scale and position angle ( p.a . ) origin for those observations were calibrated from observations of the astrometric binary @xmath4  aqr ( heintz 1989 ) .    0.1 cm    .angular separation measurements [ cols=\"^,>,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab_mag ]    the difference in brightness between the components of gl  570bc has been measured on several occasions in different bandpasses .",
    "mariotti et al . ( 1990 ) obtained magnitude differences of @xmath5=1.27@xmath60.12 , @xmath7=1.19@xmath60.12 , @xmath8=1.12@xmath60.07 , and @xmath9=1.06@xmath60.17 from their 1d scanning speckle observations .",
    "hmcc published another estimate in the j band , @xmath5=1.30@xmath60.04 .",
    "our own adaptive optics measurements provide @xmath8=1.18@xmath60.04 , as well as @xmath10=1.18@xmath60.04 in a narrow band br@xmath11 ( 2.166@xmath12 ) filter .",
    "we estimate a correction of @xmath13=0.04 , using synthetic photometry generated from nextgen ( hauschild , allard , & baron 1999 ) model spectra of effective temperatures that bracket those apropriate for m dwarfs of the luminosities of the two components of gl  570bc .",
    "this provides a second determination of the k band flux ratio , @xmath8=1.22@xmath60.04 .",
    "while those measurements are mutually consistent for every filter , their run with wavelenghth is only marginally compatible with the known ir colours of m dwarfs ( leggett 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 and ( particularly ) @xmath15 colours of early and mid - m dwarfs define a remarkably flat plateau ( leggett 1992 ) : when the spectral type of solar metallicity stars ( apropriate for gl  570bc ) varies between m0v ( m@xmath164.8 ) and m5.5v ( m@xmath167.9 ) , @xmath14 only changes from 0.68 to 0.57 , and @xmath15 just from 0.85 to 0.87 ( leggett 1992 ) the two components of gl  570bc respectively have m@xmath165.4 and m@xmath166.6 and their @xmath14 and @xmath15 colours are therefore expected to only differ by about -0.04 and + 0.01 .",
    "@xmath5 should therefore be almost identical to @xmath8 , whereas the observations give @xmath5-@xmath8=0.14@xmath60.04 , and @xmath5-@xmath7 should be -0.04 , whereas the observations indicate @xmath5-@xmath7=+0.11@xmath60.12 . as the integrated colours of the system",
    "match the expected values , this inconsistency must come from some of the measured magnitude differences .",
    "we suspect that it traces back to an overestimated contrast in the j and h band observations of both mariotti et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and hmcc , since speckle techniques have a known bias towards underestimating the relative flux of faint components ( perrier 1988 ) .",
    "the k band adaptive optics observations are in principle immune to this bias , and the k band speckle observations of mariotti et al .",
    "( 1990 ) should be relatively unaffected , thanks to the low d/@xmath17 ( where d is the telescope diameter and @xmath17 is the fried parameter of the atmosphere ) at this longer wavelength .",
    "we therefore tentatively adopt as the basis of our magnitude difference system the mean of the three k band measurements , @xmath8=1.18@xmath60.03 . from this value",
    "we then derive preferred values of @xmath5=1.19 and @xmath7=1.15 , but we will also consider the published j and k flux ratios as an alternative . this discrepancy contributes significant uncertainty to the analysis , and better measurements of the flux ratios at @xmath18 and @xmath19 would be of considerable interest . to date all our adaptive optics measurements in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands",
    "have unfortunately been obtained at phases when the secondary star overlaps the first airy ring of the primary for these wavelengths .",
    "these circumstances maximize the uncertainties in differential photometry from partially corrected adaptive optics images ( veran et al . 1999 ) , and these data therefore contribute no useful information on the flux density ratio .",
    "absolute magnitudes were derived from the parallax and the apparent magnitudes of the individual stars .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the brighter star have uncertainties which are dominated by those of the photometry of the system , while those for the secondary have some contribution from the magnitude difference .",
    "the parallax does nt appreciably contribute in either case .",
    "the accurate masses and absolute magnitudes that we have obtained for the gl  570bc system represent a new benchmark for model calculations ( e.g. baraffe et al . 1998 ) and an independent check of the empirical mass - luminosity relations ( hmcc ) . the constraints which they bring to the models are largely complementary to those coming from the eclipsing binaries , whose absolute radii can be determined very accurately but whose larger distances on the other hand contribute significant uncertainties to the absolute magnitudes .    as long emphasized by theoreticians , and by observers of more massive stars ( e.g. andersen 1991 )",
    ", there is however no such thing as one single mass - luminosity relation : stellar luminosities depend on chemical composition as well as on mass ( in general they depend on age too , though not in the age and mass range discussed here ) .",
    "quantitative metallicity determinations however are notoriously difficult for m dwarfs ( e.g. viti et al . 1997 ; valenti et al .",
    "observers in this field usually have to resort to photometric metallicity estimators ( leggett 1992 ) which are only approximately calibrated , or otherwise assume by default a solar metallicity .",
    "thanks to its physical association with the hotter gl  570a ( k4v ) , the gl  570bc pair represents a rare case of two m dwarfs with a very well determined spectroscopic metallicity .",
    "its accurate masses are thus fortunately matched with excellent metallicities .",
    "hearnshaw ( 1976 ) first measured the metallicity of gl  570a from high resolution electronographic spectra and obtained [ fe / h]=+0.01@xmath60.15 .",
    "more recently , feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) measured [ fe / h]=0.04@xmath60.02(random)@xmath60.1(systematic ) from high s / n r=10@xmath20 echelle ccd spectra .",
    "these authors find some evidence for nlte overionisation of fe into fe@xmath21 , but the derived elemental fe abundance is unaffected , as fe is overwhelmingly neutral in the photosphere of a k4 dwarf .",
    "quite conveniently for comparison with published models , the gl  570 system thus has a truly solar metallicity .",
    "figure [ ml_plot ] compares the mass and luminosity of the two components of gl  570bc with the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) 10  gyr solar - metallicity isochrone .",
    "these models consistently combine stellar evolution models ( e.g. chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) and non - grey atmospheric models ( allard & hauschild 1995 ; hauschild et al .",
    "the present generation of these evolutionary models still uses non - dusty atmospheres , but dust only becomes relevant at effective temperatures significantly lower than those of gl  570bc ( allard 1998 ) .",
    "the baraffe et al .",
    "models are consistently slightly brighter in all 3 bands than the two stars , by 0.08 to 0.15 magnitude . while this level of agreement is already very comforting , the discrepancies are significant at the @xmath13@xmath22 levels and may point towards remaining low level deficiencies of the theoretical models . if one adopts the measured j and h band flux ratios , rather than the smaller values that we have estimated from the k band measurement , the agreement with the models improves only slightly for the primary star , as its magnitude only weakly depends on the exact value of the large flux ratio . at the same time this choice degrades",
    "the agreement for the fainter star by a larger factor , and the overall agreement with the models is significantly worse .",
    "figure [ ml_plot ] also shows the data points of hmcc , as well as their analytic representation of those data .",
    "the agreement is essentially perfect with the @xmath18 band hmcc relation , while the @xmath19 and @xmath23 band relations are slightly discrepant , by respectively 0.1 and 0.15 magnitudes .",
    "we note that the hmcc mass - luminosity relations are only consistent with the empirical m dwarf colours of leggett ( 1992 ) at this 0.100.15  magnitude level , even though the hmcc photometry mostly traces back to leggett ( 1992 ) .",
    "this is because the hmcc mass - magnitude relations for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 were adjusted independently , without explicit forcing of colour consistency .",
    "the perfect agreement with the @xmath18 band hmcc fit is therefore probably fortuitous to some extent , and the 0.10 to 0.15 discrepancy for the @xmath19 and @xmath23 bands probably represents a more realistic estimate of the accuracy of those analytic fits around 0.5  .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of our two late colleagues , antoine duquennoy and jean marie mariotti , who started this program with two of us ( cp , mm ) and pushed it forward until their untimely death .",
    "we are indebted to the many coravel observers who contributed to measurements of gl  570bc over the years , and to didier queloz , dominique naef and nuno santos who obtained some elodie and coralie radial velocities for us at critical orbital phases .",
    "we also warmly thank the colleagues who assisted us for the 2d speckle or ao observations : steve ridgway and julian christou who participated in the kpno 2d speckle observation and ron probst for the operation of the infrared imager , daniel rouan , franois lacombe and their group for the assistance with the cfht circus infrared camera and e. tessier who wrote and operated its speckle acquisition and reduction software , the operators and the support and infrared teams of eso , la silla for their help during come - on+ observations .",

    "<S> the derived masses and absolute magnitudes generally validate the theoretical and empirical mass - luminosity relations around 0.5  , but point towards some low level discrepancies at the 0.1 to 0.15 magnitude level . </S>",
    "<S> forthcoming results of this observing program will extend the comparison to much lower masses with similar accuracy . </S>"
