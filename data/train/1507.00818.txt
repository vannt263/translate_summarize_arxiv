    "quantum field theory ( qft ) provides us with an extremely rich framework in which we can formulate and analyze a microscopic description of various degrees of freedom in nature , their interactions and emerging phenomenology .",
    "the standard treatment , such as through summing up feynman diagrams _ etc .",
    "_ however , is completely perturbative and relies the existence of a suitable ( dimensionless ) _ small _ coupling in which the putative perturbation can be carried out .",
    "unfortunately , the existence of such a small coupling is far from guaranteed in physical systems .",
    "in fact , recent experimental endeavours have produced numerous examples of strongly - coupled systems across a wide range of energy - scales , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at tev - scale ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , or the cold atoms at unitarity at ev - scale ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "a plethora of strong - coupling physics data currently confronts us for a theoretical handle and understanding of the same from a first principle calculation .    notwithstanding the non - perturbative formulations in qft , the likes of schwinger - dyson equation or ward - takahashi identities that result from an underlying symmetry of the path integral , the so - called ads / cft correspondence@xcite has emerged to be an excellent tool for qualitative understanding of strong - coupling physics .",
    "the core of this correspondence is rooted in a more general gauge - string duality , for which a vast number of large @xmath5 , @xmath3-type gauge theories can be explored .",
    "moreover , gauge - string duality turns out to be very crucial to analyze time - dependent ( hence out - of - equilibrium ) physics at strong coupling .",
    "typically , we only have a handful of examples where such questions can be completely addressed within a qft - framework , see _",
    "e.g. _  recent works in @xcite",
    ". moreover , many of these efforts rely heavily on conformal field theory in @xmath6-dimension , where an infinite dimensional conformal group strongly facilitates the analysis .",
    "thus the governing principles and universal features , assuming they exist , in a time - dependent system remains elusive .",
    "time - dependent aspects in physics typically involve the physics of thermalization or a quench process , and there is already a vast literature on analysis from a holographic perspective .",
    "however , there is an intermediate state of a system , which is stationary but not static .",
    "this is normally known as the non - equilibrium steady - state ( ness ) .",
    "such a state is described by a time - varying microscopic description , that yields a time - independent macroscopic observable .",
    "we know that in equilibrium thermodynamics provides us with a remarkably successful macroscopic description of a system , in terms of a handful of extensive and intensive variables .",
    "it is therefore a natural question whether for a steady - state system an  effective \" or  analogous \" thermodynamic description exists .",
    "it is useful to note that an  effective \" thermal description of an inherently non - equilibrium system has already been observed in @xcite-@xcite , in systems at quantum criticality@xcite or aging glass systems@xcite .",
    "more recently , far from equilibrium physics in a strongly coupled quantum critical system has been addressed in @xcite .    in this article , which is a sequel to @xcite",
    ", we will use gauge - string duality to demonstrate that for a very large class of systems in a steady - state , an effective thermodynamic description holds .",
    "this effective thermodynamic description comes equipped with an effective temperature , _",
    "i.e. _  the intensive variable , but may not come with an  effective entropy \" , _",
    "i.e. _  the canonically conjugate extensive variable .",
    "the prototype of our model is as follows : we consider a bath of a large number of degrees of freedom , and for the time being we will restrict ourselves to the adjoint sector of an @xmath3-gauge theory in the large @xmath5 limit . in this heat bath , we want to introduce a  probe \" sector : typically this would be a fundamental matter sector with @xmath0 number of flavours .",
    "we will work in the limit @xmath7 . in the dual gravitational description",
    "this is equivalent to studying the embeddings of a probe d@xmath8-brane in the background of a large number of d@xmath9-branes .",
    "the steady - state can be induced in the probe sector by exciting gauge fields on the probe worldvolume ; this in turn corresponds to applying a constant electric field and inducing a steady current .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "degrees of freedom are in a steady - state and coupled to a heat bath that consists of @xmath10 degrees of freedom , ]    thus we have a bath of @xmath10 degrees of freedom kept at a temperature @xmath11 and we are introducing an @xmath12 probe degrees of freedom which is in thermal contact with the bath .",
    "now we excite a constant electric field in one of the gauge theory directions , which should drive a current through schwinger pair production even at the absence of a charge density .",
    "clearly , there will be a reverse energy - flux flowing from the probe sector to the heat bath that should eventually raise the temperature of the bath .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath4 , this energy transfer is @xmath13 suppressed .",
    "note that , the d@xmath9-brane background are solutions of supergravity which essentially arises from the closed string sector .",
    "the dynamics of the probe d@xmath8-branes are described by the dirac - born - infeld action which arises from the open string sector .",
    "we will argue , through various ",
    "top - down \" stringy constructions , that an open string equivalence principle determines the effective thermodynamics .",
    "this article is divided in the following parts : in section 2 , we begin reviewing the dynamics of a probe d@xmath14-brane in the background of @xmath5 d@xmath15-branes .",
    "first we describe the classical physics and then move on to discuss the fluctuations on the probe . in this section",
    "we carefully derive all possible fluctuations of the d@xmath14-brane and argue that the fluctuations on the brane obey an open string equivalence principle and sense an  effective \" temperature . in section 3 , we sketch out how to construct more examples following a similar approach .",
    "in section 4 , we abstract away from the specific stringy construction and discuss general properties of the open string metric . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate that the same structure remains true for schrdinger - symmetric spacetime . in the following section we argue that",
    "a richer , but qualitatively similar physics emerges if we consider the non - abelian generalization of the dbi - action . finally we conclude in section 7 .",
    "some technical details have been relegated to two appendices .",
    "let us begin by discussing the prototypical model for ads / cft , which is obtained by considering the near - horizon limit of a stack of @xmath5 d3-branes sitting at the tip of a singularity .",
