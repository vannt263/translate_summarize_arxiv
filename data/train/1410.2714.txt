    "@xmath0-hypernuclei ( hypernuclei in the following ) decay through weak interaction to non - strange nuclear systems following two modes , the mesonic ( mwd ) and the non - mesonic ( nmwd ) one . the mwd is further split into two branches corresponding to the decay modes of the @xmath0 in free space : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 indicates the hypernucleus with mass number @xmath4 and atomic number @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the residual nuclear system , usually the daughter nucleus in its ground state , and the @xmath11 s stand for the decay widths . since the momentum released to the nucleon in mwd ( p@xmath12100 mev / c , q@xmath1337 mev ) is much lower than the fermi momentum , the mwd is strongly suppressed by the pauli exclusion principle in all but the lightest hypernuclei . in nmwd",
    "the hypernucleus decays through weak interaction involving the constituent @xmath0 and one or more core nucleons .",
    "the importance of such processes was pointed out for the first time in @xcite .",
    "if the pion emitted in the weak vertex @xmath14 is virtual , then it can be absorbed by the nuclear medium giving origin to : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 the processes ( [ gammap ] ) and ( [ gamman ] ) are globally indicated as one - nucleon induced decays ( one - proton ( [ gammap ] ) , one - neutron ( [ gamman ] ) ) while ( [ gamma2 ] ) as two - nucleon induced decay . by neglecting @xmath0 weak interactions with nuclear clusters of more than two nucleons , the total nmwd width is : @xmath18 the two - nucleon induced mechanism ( [ gamma2 ] ) was first suggested in @xcite and interpreted by assuming that the virtual pion from the weak vertex is absorbed by a pair of nucleons ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) , correlated by the strong interaction . in ( [ gamma2 ] ) we have indicated for simplicity only the most probable process involving @xmath19 pairs .",
    "note that the nmwd can also be mediated by the exchange of mesons more massive than the pion .",
    "the nmwd mode is possible only in nuclei ; the q - value of the elementary weak reactions driving the decays ( [ gammap ] ) , ( [ gamman ] ) and ( [ gamma2 ] ) is high enough ( q@xmath22175 mev ) to avoid any pauli blocking effect and the final nucleons thus have a large probability to escape from the nucleus .",
    "indeed it is expected that nmwd dominates over mwd for all but the @xmath23-shell hypernuclei and only for very light systems the two decay modes are expected to be competitive .",
    "the total decay width of an hypernucleus , @xmath24 , is thus given by : @xmath25 in order to compare data from different hypernuclei , partial @xmath11 s are usually given in units of @xmath26 , the total decay width of the free @xmath0 .",
    "the nmwd of hypernuclei has been scarcely studied up to a few years ago .",
    "experimentally it is not only necessary to produce and to identify hypernuclei in their ground state by means of a performing magnetic spectrometer , but also to detect in coincidence the nucleons emitted in ( [ gammap ] ) , ( [ gamman ] ) and ( [ gamma2 ] ) and to measure their energy .",
    "furthermore , there is a big difficulty in extracting the observables related to the above mentioned weak processes due to the strong distorsion introduced by final state interaction ( fsi ) on the spectra of the nucleons emitted in the elementary processes corresponding to ( [ gammap ] ) , ( [ gamman ] ) , ( [ gamma2 ] )",
    ". the information on the initial bare momenta may be completely lost , and their contributions can be mixed , with possible additional quantum - mechanical interference effects @xcite .    following the first pioneering experiments @xcite , the sks collaboration measured at the 12 gev kek ps the spectra of protons and neutrons from the nmwd of @xmath27he and @xmath28c produced by the ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) reaction at 1.05 gev / c @xcite . at the da@xmath31ne ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) collider the finuda collaboration measured the spectra of protons and neutrons from @xmath27he and from 7 @xmath34-shell hypernuclei . a full account of all the papers on the subject may be found in @xcite .",
    "many theoretical papers have also been produced , motivated by the strong interest and discovery potential of the study of nmwd of hypernuclei ; they are listed @xcite as well .",
    "in an early paper @xcite proton spectra from nmwd of @xmath27he , @xmath35li and @xmath28c , measured by finuda , were presented and discussed .    as a second step ,",
    "proton spectra from nmwd of @xmath36be , @xmath37b , @xmath38c , @xmath39n and @xmath40o were produced and analyzed @xcite ; the experimental energy resolution was @xmath41 at 80 mev .",
    "figure  [ pspectra ] shows all the experimental spectra ; they are up to now a unique data bank for @xmath34-shell hypernuclei with @xmath1 , from which several interesting considerations and conclusions were drawn .    in @xcite",
    "we developed a method for disentangling the contributions from the decay ( [ gamma2 ] ) without using intranuclear cascade ( inc ) calculations , as in @xcite .",
    "the first step was to fit the eight experimental spectra of figure  [ pspectra ] above 80 mev ( @xmath42 ) to gaussians with free central values , widths and areas . in table",
    "[ table1 ] the values of the gaussian s centers , @xmath43 , with their statistical error are reported .",

    "table  [ table2 ] reports , in the sixth column , the theoretical values of @xmath3 calculated recently in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the new evaluation , following the determination of @xmath53 given by ( [ alpha_a ] ) , and the former indirect calculation for both @xmath27he and @xmath28c from ( [ explicit ] ) are compatible within the error : thus it appears that the method used to evaluate @xmath53 does not introduce any systematic error in the @xmath3 value . on the other hand ,",
