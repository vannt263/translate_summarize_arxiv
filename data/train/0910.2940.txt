    "a present - day goal in nuclear theory is to develop a universal theory of nuclear structure , in the sense that it is well - founded in its methodology and is applicable across the chart of nuclides .",
    "the most promising starting point is self - consistent mean - field , but the theory must be extended in some way to treat excitations and nuclear spectroscopy . for any candidate theory or methodology , one needs to know its performance on known observables to be confident about predictions to unknown nuclei or regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "it is our purpose to provide and document this information for one particular theory , the constrained - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( chfb ) theory together with a mapping to the five - dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) , using the gogny d1s interaction in the nuclear hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are a major extension of the our study of one particular observable in the chfb+5dch theory , the low - lying quadrupole excitation @xcite . since that work and during the course of the present calculations two new parameterizations of the gogny force have been published @xcite .",
    "these are aimed at removing systematic deviations of calculated binding energies from measurements using the d1s force . however , for our purposes , the global assessment of spectroscopy properties , it is more important at this stage to benchmark the predictions of a stable and widely tested hamiltonian .",
    "the present results will therefore serve as a baseline for comparisons with the next generation of similar structure calculations based on the new parameterizations .",
    "we mention that the present era of global calculations within self - consistent mean field theory using a fixed interaction started with the calculations of tajima et al .",
    "@xcite and lalazissis et al . @xcite .",
    "also , the mapping to 5dch has recently been adapted and applied to the skyrme and the relativistic mean - field hamiltonians @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the chfb+5dch theory is one of several paths that could be taken to extend mean - field theory to describe spectroscopic properties such as excitation energies . rather than constructing a collective hamiltonian from the chfb solutions ,",
    "the constrained wave functions may be projected on good angular momentum and then used directly to construct a discrete basis hamiltonian .",
    "this technology in now fairly well developed @xcite and has recently been applied to the global study of correlation energies @xcite and the lowest @xmath5 excitations @xcite . in principle , it should give similar results to the chfb+5dch theory applying the same hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the present implementations the discrete - basis wave functions do not include triaxial deformations and the effective rotational inertias arising from the hamiltonian matrix element are not self - consistent . on the other hand , discrete basis methods do not rely on the gaussian overlap approximation which we require for our hamiltonian mapping .",
    "there is a third path to introduce dynamics into mean field theory , the quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) . that has also been applied to many nuclei , but",
    "so far global surveys have been restricted to spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "the methodology in the present work has two stages , the chfb calculations to set up the 5dch input , and the solution of the 5dch equations .",
    "for the first part , we perform chfb calculations on a large triaxial grid of quadrupole deformations .",
    "these provide a potential energy surface and the inertial masses needed for the 5dch .",
    "positive parity solutions are extracted for about 1700 even - even nuclei with proton numbers z = 10 to z = 110 and neutron numbers n @xmath2 200 .",
    "these calculations span most of the periodic table from drip - line to drip - line .",
    "one purpose of our work is to establish benchmarks for the accuracy and reliability of the theory for energies and properties of the low excitations .",
    "we therefore make systematic comparisons with experimental data , especially when it is available as a tabulation from a published critical review or data repository . the quantities that we can easily compare are two - nucleon separation energies and gaps , excitation energies of the lowest excited states including yrast spectra up to @xmath3 , and transition rates of the lowest @xmath5 and excited @xmath4 states .",
    "since no effective charge is involved , our predictions are free of parameters beyond those contained in the gogny d1s interaction .",
    "we hope these calculations will be helpful to understand the limitations of the theory and ultimately find improved methodologies and hamiltonians . one important question deals with shell gaps and magic numbers .",
    "far from stability , dedicated experiments have shown that the n = 20 , 28 shell gaps experience erosion and that n = 16 may become magic number at the oxygen neutron drip - line @xcite .",
    "other experiments are underway to investigate whether shell quenching takes place too in the vicinity of the n = 50 gap , a critical issue for the path followed by the r - process of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "the predictions for the shell gaps and associated observables coming from the gogny interaction have previously been reported @xcite .",
    "another purpose of this work is to provide a set of predictions for nuclei to be studied in future .",
    "the advent of unstable nuclear beam facilities has opened up a new and exciting area in exploring the structure of exotic nuclei .",
    "of particular interest are the nuclei near or at the border lines of stability , the proton and neutron drip - lines .",
    "these nuclei often display properties which are not present in nuclei located in the vicinity of the @xmath8-stability line , and questions are raised as to whether the nuclear structure models and effective forces tailored over the past seventy years remain valid in the present context .",
    "thus , strong deviations of the experimental findings with respect to the benchmarked predicted accuracy would signal new phenomena in nuclear structure .",
    "several caveats should be mentioned that limit the domain of validity of the theory .",
    "a basic approximation made here is to require the hfb fields to conserve parity and signature .",
    "there is no strong evidence that these symmetries are violated in the hfb ground states , but there may be some nuclei for which it happens .",
    "another limitation arises from the neglect of two- and higher - order- quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations .",
    "the gcm theory ( with or without the gaussian overlap approximation ) does not include these degrees of freedom which will inevitably affect the spectrum at higher excitation energies .",
    "also , the hamiltonian is an adiabatic one , with parameters calculated in the vicinity of zero rotational frequency .",
    "this affects the reliability of the calculated excitations with high angular momentum .",
    "finally , the application of the 5dch requires further that the overlaps be semilocalized in the @xmath11 quadrupole deformation plane ( coherence length be small compared to dimensions of the arena in @xmath11 in which the wave function has significant amplitude ) .",
    "indeed , the mapping of the hfb to the collective hamiltonian is problematic for very rigid nuclei , such as the doubly magic ones . for these reasons ,",
    "we concentrate on the lowest excited states in this work in non - doubly magic nuclei , and restricting angular momentum to @xmath12 .",
    "for completeness , we recall here the equations to be solved .",
    "the derivation and some aspects of the implementation are presented in more detail in ref .",
    "the potential energy surface that goes into the 5dch is obtained from constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations ( chfb ) based on the gogny d1s interaction . the chfb equations to solve are @xmath13 and quadrupole moments @xmath14 according to @xmath15 here we define the quadrupole operators as @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the chfb equations are solved for each set of deformations by expanding the single particle states in a triaxial harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "the triaxial oscillator basis is subject to truncation according to @xmath18 where @xmath19 , with @xmath20 as oscillator basis parameters , and @xmath21 as quantum numbers .",
    "the basis is determined as follows . for a nucleus with z protons and n neutrons",
    ", the number @xmath22 is such that @xmath23 , the number of single particle states in the hartree - fock scheme , is eight times the number of levels occupied by the larger among the z or n values .",
    "@xmath24 is a function of @xmath22 , fulfilling the empirically established equation @xmath25 from which @xmath22 is deduced . in general @xmath22",
    "is not an integer .    instead of using the @xmath26 parameters , we adopt in the hfb calculations the parameters @xmath27 , p and q , with p= @xmath28 and q=@xmath29 .",
    "these parameters need be determined to define the oscillator basis at each point of the grid .",
    "the parameters p and q are determined using formulas based on a liquid drop parametrization of nuclear shape .",
    "these formulas depend upon @xmath8 and @xmath7 deformations in the constrained hfb calculations , and write as @xmath30,\\\\ \\nonumber   q=\\exp(x[\\frac{3}{2}\\cos\\gamma-\\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}\\sin\\gamma ] ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath27 is obtained through minimization of the hfb energy .",
    "this is made for @xmath7= 0@xmath32 and 60@xmath32 at a fixed @xmath8 to take advantage of our axially symmetric hfb code which is running much faster than the triaxial code .",
    "to get @xmath27 values over the triaxial plane , we use the interpolation formula @xmath33 + \\frac{1}{2 } [ \\omega_0(\\beta,\\gamma=0^o ) - \\omega_0(\\beta,\\gamma=60^o ) ] \\cos(3\\gamma).\\ ] ]    for the basis truncation , a fine tuning of p and q values is performed so as to maximize the number of particle states without altering the numbers of oscillator shells in each of the three directions as obtained with eq.([pq ] ) . typically , the number of major shells @xmath24 ranges from 6 to 16 in the present study .    the bogoliubov space is restricted by imposing the self - consistent symmetry @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the reflection with respect to the x0z plane , and @xmath36 the time - reversal symmetry",
    "the hfb nuclear states have also been taken invariant under the left - right symmetry  @xcite .",
    "one technical point should be mentioned .",
    "since there are many points to calculate , it is important to have an efficient algorithm to perform iterative solution of the chfb equations . from the early days , we found it very helpful in this respect to use first order perturbation theory to update the linear constraints . during the iterative procedure the obtained mean value @xmath37 differs from the imposed value @xmath38 , the corrections applied to the lagrange parameters",

[ pot ] it is convenient to use the dimensionless deformation parameters @xmath11 which are defined through @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48   fm .",
    "typically , the constrained hfb equations are solved on the domain ( @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ) with mesh spacings @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the final 5dch is expressed @xcite @xmath53 where we have made another change of deformation parameters from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and where @xmath57 is the metric @xcite .",
    "there are 3 rotational inertia and 3 quadrupole mass parameters in the 5dch .",
    "these are all computed from the local properties of the chfb solutions at the grid points . to calculate the rotational inertia we implement additional constraining fields @xmath58 to eq .",

    "we take @xmath64 mev to approximate the limit .",
    "the quadrupole mass parameters @xmath65 are calculated in the cranking approximation @xcite , b_ij(q)= , with @xmath66 the moment defined in eq.([moment ] ) .",
    "+ it is important to mention that the cranking approximation is not self - consistent in the sense that the dynamical rearrangement is not taken into account and we should expect some deficiencies in the theory as a result .",
    "the zero - point energy ( zpe ) correction to the potential , eq.([pot ] ) , is associated with the nonlocality in the quadrupole coordinates . it is calculated according to the formulas given in refs .",

    "this includes only the part of the zpe arising from the kinetic energy operator .",
    "there is also a part due to the potential , which we neglect .",
    "this is expected to be small in typical situations with shallow minima in the potential energy surface ; it might be significant near magic numbers where the curvature of the surface is higher .",
    "eigenstates and eigenenergies are obtained as numerical solutions of @xmath70 the orthonormalized eigenstates @xmath71 with angular momentum j and projections m on the third axis in the laboratory frame are expanded as @xmath72 with @xmath73 a superposition of wigner rotation matrices .",
    "the probability @xmath74 of the different @xmath75 components of the wave function gives a useful indicator of its character .",

    "here we use the value @xmath76 = 28 for the order parameter in the power expansion of vibrational amplitude .",
    "this secure a 2% precision on relative energies in collective spectra .",

    "this is an approximation , but we have no reason to doubt its reasonableness .    the correlation energy is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the minimum of the energy at the hfb level , and @xmath80 is the energy of the collective ground state obtained from the 5dch calculations . for nuclei near magic numbers ,",
    "the calculated correlation energy may come out negative , which is unphysical .",
    "we have kept these nuclei in the accompanying table , but we exclude them when we compare the calculated properties with experiment .    also , the accuracy of the calculations will not be as high at the extremes of the nuclear chart , due to the incipient shape instability associated with fission , as well as the limitations of the harmonic oscillator basis for dripline orbitals . in the accompanying tables , we include the ground state properties when the calculated deformation is consistent with a non vanishing fission barrier in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "this will include some nuclei that would have vanishing fission barrier when more shape degrees of freedom are permitted .",
    "to show the scope of the theory , we begin with two examples of nuclei that illustrate the complexity of nuclear structure that can be addressed with the 5dch .",
    "the first is , which is considered as an example of a soft nucleus .",
    "the second is @xmath81sm , which has a near rotational spectrum but is also considered to be a transitional nucleus .    [ [ section ] ]",
    "we begin with , a nucleus with a complex spectrum of low - lying excitations providing evidence for shape coexistence phenomena .",
    "a few calculated spectroscopic properties of this nucleus were already reported in ref .",
    "the ground state of is spherical in the hfb approximation , but becomes highly deformed in the chfb+5dch wave function , with mean deformation values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    ", we will examine systematically the @xmath89 , and @xmath90 excitations .",
    "these are shown for the  nucleus together with the additional states that could form a @xmath7-vibrational structure in fig .",
    "[ fi:76kr ] @xcite .    the experimental spectrum is also shown in the figure , and one sees that excitation energies are reproduced very well .",
    "the calculated excitation energy of the first excited state , the @xmath91 , is only 21% higher than experiment .",
    "the other states are proportionally even closer : the energies of the yrast @xmath92 and @xmath90 states are within 10% of the experimental values . even the non - yrast excited state energies come out well .",
    "we shall later examine systematically the @xmath93 and @xmath94 excitations ; in  their predicted energies are all within 20% of experiment .",
    "for the transition strengths , the predicted @xmath95 is within 20% of the experimental value and the higher transitions along the yrast ladder are within 10% .",
    "the second excited state in the system is the @xmath9 level at 0.77 mev .",
    "the calculated energy is 0.92 mev , close enough to make a correspondence between the two states .",
    "its mean deformation parameters are close to those of the ground state , suggesting a @xmath8-vibrational interpretation .",
    "the transition rate to the @xmath91 state is large and in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "the @xmath94 excitation corresponds in excitation energy fairly well to experimentally measured state .",
    "the @xmath94 wave function has a large probability @xmath96 , suggesting that it be placed with the @xmath9 level as member of the k = 0 excited structure .",

    "experiment and calculation for the spectroscopic quadrupole moment q@xmath97 are also in accord for both magnitude and sign .",
    "the sign is opposite to that for q@xmath98 , nullifying any interpretation of the k = 0 excited structure as @xmath8-vibrational band and giving weight to the interpretation of shape coexistence between prolate and oblate band structures .    from the energetics",
    ", the @xmath99 level might be assigned at a two - phonon excitation of the ground state .",
    "the calculated @xmath99 wave function has a large probability for @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , suggesting that this level instead is the bandhead of a @xmath7-structure .",
    "however , the experimental data on the transition strengths between the @xmath99 and the @xmath102 and @xmath103 states are very far from the theoretical predictions .",
    "since transition strengths of @xmath7-vibrations are very sensitive to @xmath75-band mixing , the disagreement of transition strengths does not rule out the @xmath7-vibrational interpretation . for more discussions , see @xcite .",
    "we finally mention the highest excitations , some of which will be beyond the scope of our global survey .",
    "there is good accord between theory and experiment for the energetics of the @xmath90 state as well as for those for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 levels which both form a quasi-@xmath7 band structure on top of the @xmath99 state .",
    "the @xmath90 and @xmath104 states have strong transitions to the @xmath92 and @xmath99 states , respectively , in both theory and experiment .",
    "to summarize , the chfb+5dch theory provides a very good description of low - lying excited states spectrum .",
    "while not all aspects are reproduced , many of the energies and relative transition strengths are given to good accuracy .",
    "the complex spectra of the kr isotopes have often been discussed as a shape coexistence phenomenon , and the theory does rather well in describing these features as well as shape transitions in this region @xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath81sm lies at the start of the deformed lanthanide region of the nuclear chart and is considered as landmark in the identification of first - order quantum phase transition between spherical and axially deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "its experimental level scheme is shown in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fi : sm152 ] , taken from ref . @xcite and our calculated level scheme is in the right - hand panel .",
    "we first note that the yrast band is well reproduced .",
    "the @xmath91 excitation energy is within 2% of the experimental one , and the experimental ratio of the @xmath92 to the @xmath91 energies is @xmath105 , slightly lower than the rigid axial rotor value 10/3 .",
    "the 5dch ratio is 3.0 , reproducing the slight deviation from rigidity .",
    "the yrast spectrum is intermediate between that for harmonic vibrators and axial rotors , consistent with predictions from the x(5 ) model designed as analytic description of critical point structures in n @xmath106 90 isotones @xcite . for a review see @xcite .",
    ".experimental and theoretical e2 transition strengths @xmath107  ( @xmath108 ) of @xmath81sm .",
    "from left to right : exp1 and exp2 are for @xmath109 experimental data from ref.@xcite and @xcite , respectively , and th are for 5dch calculations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabd ]    we now come to the predictions for the @xmath9 excitation and the collective structure built upon it .",
    "the calculated deformation of that state is @xmath110 , almost the same as the ground state deformation , @xmath111 .",
    "this suggests an interpretation as a @xmath8-vibration .",
    "one expects that the fluctuation in @xmath8 would be larger in the vibrational excitation than in the ground state ; in the harmonic limit , @xmath112 , giving a ratio of @xmath113 . in fact , the fluctuation in the calculated wave functions is larger for the excited state , by a factor 1.58 .",
    "thus , the theoretical wave function has the main characteristics to be a @xmath8-vibration .    comparing experimental and calculated spectra",
    ", we first note that the calculated excitation energy of the @xmath9 state is quite a bit higher than observed experimentally , by nearly 40% .",
    "as we will see later , this is a common feature of the chfb+5dch theory as presently implemented .",
    "the experimental energy splitting between the @xmath99 and @xmath9 states is nearly identical to that of the ground state band , while the theoretical splitting is larger by 40% .",
    "this discrepancy is in keeping with that of the x(5 ) model @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the theory confirms in an approximate manner the existence of a band structure based on the @xmath9 excitation , but in detail deviates from the @xmath8-vibrational limit in the in - band energetics .",
    "the chfb+5dch theory also predicts a @xmath94 excitation and collective structure upon it .",
    "this sequence is interpreted as a quasi @xmath7-vibrational band , with head level energy slightly higher than that observed in this nucleus .",
    "our calculated third @xmath5 state has the same average @xmath114 deformation as the ground state , supporting a vibrational interpretation .",
    "if it were a true @xmath7-vibration , it should have high probability for the @xmath115 component of the wave function .",
    "this probability is 0.64 compared with 0.002 and 0.35 for the @xmath91 and @xmath99 levels , respectively .",
    "thus , the @xmath94 state has a qualitative character as a @xmath7-vibration but this is diluted by other components .",
    "this is to be expected for a transitional nucleus such as @xmath81sm .",
    "important indicators for structure properties are the strengths for intra- and inter - band e2 reduced transition probabilities .",
    "@xmath116 s measured by the georgia tech . and",
    "yale collaborations are shown in table 1 together with chfb+5dch calculations .",
    "as the two sets of experimental data display differences , comparison between b(e2 ) predictions and measurements necessarily has a global character .",
    "the figure of merit of our theory for @xmath81sm is as follows : i ) the intraband transition strengths have right order of magnitude , especially for the ground state band , ii ) the transition between @xmath7 and ground state as well as between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands are too collective , and iii ) the @xmath8 to ground state band transitions display a mixed character .",
    "the theory for the @xmath117 transition strength is about 60% too high .",
    "nevertheless we conclude that the @xmath9 excitation is a @xmath8-vibration in @xmath81sm .",
    "our present conclusion is that the structure of the ground state , @xmath8- , and quasi-@xmath7 bands is globally as the 5dch theory predicts , but there are probably other components in the wave functions , such as 2qp excitations and pairing isomerism @xcite that may have an important large effect on the out - of - band transitions .",
    "more accurate b(e2 ) measurements that are underway @xcite will be a valuable asset for making definite statements on the predictive character of present 5dch calculations and for disclosing which degrees of freedom might be missing in the structure models including the 5dch one .",
    "we begin by displaying in fig.[fi : chart1 ] the set of nuclei that we have calculated and included in our tables .",
    "this comprised all even - even nuclei that are stable with respect to two - particle emission , and that have positive correlation energies in the chfb+5dch theory . among the @xmath118 nuclei ,",
    "some ones close to the proton drip line have been removed from the chart as their inner potential barriers are too low for inhibiting fission decay . for",
    "now , we remark that the two - particle stability is almost completely determined by the hfb energies . the correlation energy @xmath119 contribution",
    "( see eq.([eq : ecorr ] ) ) only changes it for a few nuclei on the borders .",
    "the next general remark is that the criterion of positive correlation energy affects only nuclei at magic numbers .",
    "these are visible as the absence of colored circles along some of the magic number dotted lines .    in the figure ,",
    "the color coding shows the deformation @xmath8 of the ground state , with a @xmath120 sign according to the value of @xmath7 . for the hfb ground states , shown in the left - hand panel",

    "the @xmath243 ratio is flat with a value in the range 1 - 5 until @xmath10 approaches the axial rotor value , and then it can become very large . however , the width of the curve at fixed @xmath10 is too broad to use this plot in a predictive way .",

    "one sees three categories of nuclei . at one extreme",
    "are the spherical nuclei , having @xmath246 , which have the highest excitations for the @xmath9 levels , typically in the range of 2 - 4 mev . at the other extreme",
    "are the axial rotor nuclei with @xmath9 energies in the range of 1 - 2 mev .",
    "interestingly , the nuclei in between favor lower energies , in the range of 0.5 - 1.5 mev .",
    "those nuclei are likely to be soft ones , and that would be reflected in both the excitation energy of the @xmath9 levels and the range of values of @xmath10 .",
    "as said above , the @xmath9 excitation in nuclei can arise as a @xmath8-vibration , as a coexisting level with deformation different from that for lower - lying states , or something intermediate between these two extreme structures . here",

    "first we consider relationships between quadrupole transition matrix elements calculated in our theory for the @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 transitions .",
    "if the spectrum truly exhibits a @xmath8-vibrational band , the quadrupole transitions between it and the ground state should be governed by a single parameter , the matrix element of the quadrupole operator between the two intrinsic states . under these circumstances",

    "we examine now the three chfb+5dch cross - band transitions , @xmath251 , to see how well eq .  ( [ eq : gb ] ) is satisfied . according to the model , the magnitudes @xmath252 should satisfy |m_02| =    computed matrix elements from these conditions , we take the ratio of the three quantities @xmath253 to their total .",
    "the fractions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fi : triangle ] as points within a triangle , the fraction given by the distance to a side of the triangle .",
    "we see that there is a concentration of points at the center point of the triangle ; of the 1707 calculated nuclei , 398 have values of the relative matrix elements within 15% of equality .",
    "the distribution of these nuclei in @xmath254 and @xmath255 is shown in fig.[fi : jpd ] .",
    "one sees four regions where the condition is well satisfied , including the strongly deformed rare earths and actinides .",
    "we conclude that the chfb+5dch theory predicts that @xmath8-vibrational bands should be quite common , taking as a criterion that eq.(26 ) be approximately satisfied .",
    "there is also a concentration of points at the upper apex of the triangle in fig [ fi : triangle ] . for these nuclei ,",
    "the @xmath256 matrix element is much larger than the two matrix elements involving the @xmath94 excitation , suggesting that the excitations behave more like independent phonons .",
    "we now focus on the experimental situation with respect to the @xmath117 transition strength .",
    "this is an important observable in an ongoing controversy about the existence of @xmath8-bands in deformed nuclei @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it is concluded that the observed @xmath8- to ground state -band transitions are orders of magnitude weaker than those predicted by collective models for deformed rare - earth nuclei , except for very few . to assess the performance of the chfb+5dch at least in this limited region , we have compared the chfb+5dch calculations of the @xmath257 strengths with the experimental data on the 9 nuclei compiled in ref .",
    "for all of these nuclei , the chfb+5dch theory predicts a @xmath8-vibrational band that satisfies the criteria discussed in the previous subsection . for 4 of the nuclei ( @xmath258sm , @xmath259gd , and @xmath260yb ) , the calculated b(e2 ) s",
    "are of the same order as the experimental ones , but somewhat higher by up to a factor of 2 or so . however , for the remaining 5 nuclei ( @xmath261gd , @xmath262er , and @xmath263yb ) , the experimental values are an order of magnitude smaller and in strong disagreement with the chfb+5dch theory . thus , for these nuclei at least , the observed band built on the @xmath9 states does not correspond to @xmath8-vibration calculated in the chfb+5dch theory .",
    "recent measurements have shown that many @xmath4 excited states are present at low excitation energy in the deformed rare earths @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath4 levels described by the chfb+5dch may be quite fragmented .",
    "for example , the @xmath8-vibrational mode couples to such modes as pairing vibrations and/or incoherent 2qp excitations . in the algebraic models",
    ", efforts have been made to explain the extra @xmath4 states by introducing many - particle many - hole excitations @xcite .",
    "other regions of deformed nuclei like the actinides and transactinides would be worth investigating to check whether they also are missing the coherent @xmath8-vibrational structure predicted by the chfb+5dch theory .",
    "another observable relevant to the structure of the @xmath9 level is its monopole transition strength to the ground state .",
    "the strength is conventionally expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath265 defined as @xcite @xmath266 with @xmath267 fm . we calculate the required matrix element as 0^+_2 |_i=1^z r_i^2| 0^+_1= d a_0 d a_2 g^0_1_0(a_0,a_2)g^0_2_0(a_0,a_2)(a_0,a_2 ) | _",
    "i=1^z r_i^2 | ( a_0,a_2 ) .",
    "we find rather interesting systematics with respect to the neutron number as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : e0vn ] .    the calculations display oscillatory structures with broad maxima located near mid - shell closures ( n  @xmath268  40 , 64 , 100 , and 150 ) and sharp minima in the vicinity of shell closures with n  @xmath268  20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , 126 , and 184 . except for light nuclei , all these minima",
    "take place for mean ground state deformations @xmath269 with small values , that is for spherical equilibrium shapes .",
    "these features are globally consistent with iba calculations for e0 transitions : the @xmath270 values raise sharply in the shape transition regions and then remain large for well deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "other minima in e0 strengths are found below n @xmath268 126 and n @xmath268 184 neutron shell closures .",
    "those associated with @xmath169 and weak @xmath271 values are correlated with the opening of the neutron shell closure in transactinide nuclei , as discussed previously in sec .",
    "[ corener ] .",
    "the other two minima take place in open shell nuclei at mean ground state deformation in the ranges @xmath272 0.19 - 0.26 and @xmath272 0.26 - 0.30 for neutron numbers @xmath273 and @xmath274 , respectively .",
    "these features as well as similar ones identified in light nuclei with n @xmath268 20 and n @xmath268 28 indicate that the existence of minima in the e0 strengths over the ( n , z ) plane are not exclusively correlated with shell closure and spherical ground states .",
    "finally we note that the e0 strength values are at a maximum near n = 132 and n = 190 and decrease with n increasing .",
    "these features are relevant to the z @xmath275 96 isotopic chains for which mean ground state deformations display strong variations ( see right - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ fi : chart1 ] ) .",
    "we have compared our @xmath276 transition strengths to 87 of the 91 nuclei tabulated in ref .",
    "the result for @xmath277 figure of merit is given in table [ ta : metrics ] .",
    "we see that experimental matrix elements are on the average very small compared to theory .",
    "this suggests that the experimental @xmath9 levels may have a very different structure than the calculated ones .",
    "it may be that configurations ignored by the chfb+5dch , such as 2 qp excitations , may be important in the non - yrast spectrum @xcite .",
    "this problem with the parameter - free chfb+5dch theory which globally overestimates the e0 strengths by an order of magnitude is shared by other models of nuclear structure .",
    "for example , enforcing realistic model descriptions of m1 and e2 transitions or charge radii , it is not uncommon that calculated e0 strengths are up to ten times stronger than experimental values @xcite .",
    "the actual nature of e0 transitions remains an elusive issue pointing to major improvements required in structure models .",
    "we have seen above that the conditions for the occurrence of @xmath8-vibration impose the medium- and heavy - mass deformed nuclei to lay in specific ( z , n ) regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fi : jpd ] ) .",
    "one is then left with the issue as to what can be learned on collective excited k = 0 band properties for nuclei which do not belong to this sample . for this purpose",
    "we define an important indicator of band structure through the ratio    @xmath278    for all nuclei of present interest with the provision that @xmath94 levels have preponderant k = 0 component ( i.e. p(k = 0 ) @xmath275 0.75 ) in their wave functions which unambiguously makes them members of excited k = 0 bands .",
    "this ratio displays marked structures only if plotted versus neutron number .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : be23-nz ] where open and solid symbols are for @xmath279 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "@xmath280 values in the vicinity of @xmath280 = 1 are representative of the points concentrated at the center point of the triangle shown previously in fig .",
    "[ fi : triangle ] , and these take place near mid - neutron - closed shell numbers @xmath281 .",
    "most @xmath280 s take on values away from unity .",
    "those with @xmath280 @xmath275 1 are suggestive of stronger collectivity present in excited k = 0 band than in ground state band , and the other way around for @xmath280 @xmath282  1 values .",
    "it is for n @xmath282 60 nuclei that the symbols in fig .",
    "[ fi : be23-nz ] show disparate features as , within a narrow range of n values , @xmath280 rapidly flips from @xmath280 @xmath275  1 to @xmath280 @xmath282  1 .",
    "these features have not been analyzed in detail but suggest strong shell effects driving nuclei from near spherical to deformed or from prolate to oblate , or vice versa .",
    "a typical example is that offered by the neutron - deficient kr isotopes which display shape coexistence features , and also undergo a shape transition from prolate to oblate @xcite .",
    "nuclides with n @xmath275 60 display less scattered features in their ratios @xmath280 which now form a seemingly regular oscillatory trajectory versus n. extrema are not well localized but undoubtedly they are reasonably close to @xmath283 66 , 78 , 90 , 100 , 116 , 136 , 146 , 170 and 196 for nuclei with @xmath279 .",
    "detailed information on the location of nuclei with such properties over the ( n , z ) plane is not yet available . at this moment",
    "we have checked that the ratio @xmath280 can serve as good indicator for the identification of nuclei known to display shape coexistence ( i.e. isotopes of the se , kr , sr , zr , sm , hg , pb , and po elements ) associated with the presence of two ( or three ) minima in potential energy surfaces .",
    "coexistence between collective bands are calculated for pd , cd , and te isotopes which are known experimentally to display such features , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for these nuclides , coexistence is related to well localized maxima in collective masses present at different loci over the @xmath284,@xmath7 ) plane and not to prominent minima in potential energy surfaces .",
    "other theoretical treatments of this kind of coexistence have mostly been based on the interacting boson model , invoking particle - hole excitations between shells to explain the intruder states  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have evaluated the performance of the chfb+5dch theory based on the gogny d1s interaction as a global theory of nuclear structure .",
    "highlights of the successes of the theory are its accurate predictions with respect to charge radii , the classification of nuclei as deformed rotors or not , and the ground state band properties of the axial rotors .",
    "the calculated 2-nucleon separation energies are interesting in that they show shell effects and how they are modified for nuclei far from stability .",
    "an example is the nuclei near @xmath285 .",
    "these are often predicted to be spherical in hfb .",
    "this is also the case for the gogny interaction , but we find that there is a change in structure going to the chfb+5dch extension , and the nuclei become deformed rotors , in agreement with experiment .",
    "the chfb+5dch theory is a suitable framework where the issues of shell erosion and shell collapse can be addressed .    as a spectroscopic theory",
    ", the chfb+5dch has considerable predictive power for the lowest yrast and yrare states , even for nonrotational spectra .",
    "this is illustrated by predicted energies of the @xmath286 and @xmath99 excitations , which we compared with compiled empirical data .",
    "the performance with respect to the @xmath9 levels also showed predictive power , but here systematic deficiencies of the theory become apparent .",
    "all in all , it is quite remarkable that a theory based on a many - body hamiltonian with only 14 interaction parameters has such predictive power over the broad range of the nuclei that can be treated in the methodology .",
    "an important finding is that deformation alone is not a good predictor of rotational spectra .",
    "we defined a quantity , @xmath8-softness , that correlates much better . for convenience ,",
    "we summarize in table [ ta : metrics ] the figures of merit for the performance of the theory for excitation energies and transition properties .",
    "we also provide in a retrievable form the specific predictions for spectral properties of about 1700 even - even nuclei and analyzed some of the systematics of the predicted quantities .",

    "the treatment of the inertial masses could be improved by using the thouless - valatin prescription which is better justified than the cranking approximation we have used up to now .",
    "this would surely improve the energies of the @xmath9 excitations , which is one of the problems of the current theory .",
    "this would require calculating the qrpa response function at every grid point .",
    "this would of course add to the computational burden , but the ingredients to perform the calculation are available for the most part in the intermediate calculations already performed .",
    "the rotational inertias could also be improved by using a finite amplitude rotational field @xmath291 adjusted to self - consistency for the angular momentum value being calculated @xcite .",
    "the ingredients of this self - consistent treatment are already available and have been implemented in some calculations @xcite .",
    "this also would considerably add to the computational burden .",
    "we have taken the correlation energy as an indicator of the validity of the gaussian overlap approximation , and excluded nuclei whose calculated correlation energies are unphysical .",
    "a better treatment of the correlation energy would include the zpe term coming from the curvature of the potential energy surface .",
    "this term is small in nuclei with broader collective potential energy surfaces , but in noncollective nuclei the minima can be narrow , and this potential term in the hamiltonian mapping might have a significant effect .",
    "another deficiency of the chfb+5dch that became evident in the discussion of the @xmath9 level properties is the need for 2 qp components in the wave functions .",
    "this can be carried out in the gcm if the hamiltonian operator in the collective space is calculated with full treatment of the nonlocality @xcite .",
    "however , there is no clear road to us for how to include these components and keep the gaussian overlap approximation as yet .",
    "while it is remarkable that the hamiltonian based on the gogny d1s interaction has so much predictive power after 30 years , one can still ask how the calculated observables depend on the intrinsic properties of the hamiltonian and whether an improvement can be made at that level .",
    "we note that there has already been some work to improve the gogny interaction for calculating nuclear masses , while keeping unaltered the performance of the chfb+5dch and rpa theories achieved previously with d1s @xcite .    finally , as a separate publication",
    ", we will present in more detail the spectroscopic properties to higher angular momenta for the deformed rare - earth nuclei .",

    "<S> a systematic study of low energy nuclear structure at normal deformation is carried out using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory extended by the generator coordinate method and mapped onto a 5-dimensional collective quadrupole hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained with the gogny d1s interaction are presented from dripline to dripline for even - even nuclei with proton numbers @xmath0 to @xmath1 and neutron numbers n @xmath2 200 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties calculated for the ground states are their charge radii , 2-particle separation energies , correlation energies , and the intrinsic quadrupole shape parameters . for the excited spectroscopy , the observables calculated are the excitation energies and quadrupole as well as monopole transition matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> we examine in this work the yrast levels up to @xmath3 , the lowest excited @xmath4 states , and the two next yrare @xmath5 states . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applicable to more than 90% of the nuclei which have tabulated measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we assess its accuracy by comparison with experiments on all applicable nuclei where the systematic tabulations of the data are available . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted radii have an accuracy of 0.6% , much better than can be achieved with a smooth phenomenological description . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation energy obtained from the collective hamiltonian gives a significant improvement to the accuracy of the 2-particle separation energies and to their differences , the 2-particle gaps . </S>",
    "<S> many of the properties depend strongly on the intrinsic deformation and we find that the theory is especially reliable for strongly deformed nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of values of the collective structure indicator @xmath6 has a very sharp peak at the value 10/3 , in agreement with the existing data . on average , the predicted excitation energy and transition strength of the first @xmath5 excitation </S>",
    "<S> are 12 % and 22% higher than experiment , respectively , with variances of the order of 40 - 50 % . </S>",
    "<S> the theory gives a good qualitative account of the range of variation of the excitation energy of the first excited @xmath4 state , but the predicted energies are systematically 50 % high . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated yrare @xmath5 states show a clear separation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 excitations , and the energies of the @xmath5 @xmath7-vibrations accord well with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the character of the @xmath9 state is interpreted as shape coexistence or @xmath8-vibrational excitations on the basis of relative quadrupole transition strengths . </S>",
    "<S> bands are predicted with the properties of @xmath8-vibrations for many nuclei having @xmath10 values corresponding to axial rotors , but the shape coexistence phenomenon is more prevalent . </S>",
    "<S> the data set of the calculated properties of even - even nuclei , including spectroscopic properties for of them , are provided in cea website and epaps repository with this article @xcite .    _ </S>"
