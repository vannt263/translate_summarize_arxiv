    "the detection of transiting exoplanets is very important to exoplanet research because of the information about both planetary radius and mass that comes from photometric transit light curves combined with follow - up radial velocity observations .",
    "the transiting exoplanets known as of this writing span a wide range in the physical parameter space of planetary mass , radius , orbital period , semi - major axis , eccentricity ; and parent star parameters , including mass , radius , effective temperature , metallicity , and age . filling out their distribution in this multidimensional space is certain to give us important information on the origin and evolution of exoplanetary systems . here",

    "we have gathered altogether 9550 5-min exposures , each yielding photometric measurements for approximately @xmath12 stars with @xmath13 and about @xmath14 stars with better than 2% light curve  rms .",
    "the field was observed in network mode , whereby at the end of its nightly observing sequence the telescope in arizona handed off to the telescope in hawaii , thus extending the duration of continuous observations . following standard frame calibration procedures ,",

    "the hatnet discovery light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc]a . as is shown in the following sections we deduce that the signal is due to the transit of a jovian planet across the face of the star .",
    "hereafter we refer to the star as hat - p-6 , and to the planetary companion as hat - p-6b .",
    "hat - p-6 was observed spectroscopically with the cfa digital speedometer @xcite at the  tillinghast reflector of the fred l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) in order to rule out the possibility that the observed drop in brightness is caused by a transiting low - mass stellar companion rather than a planet , as well as to characterize the rotation and surface gravity of the star .",
    "seven spectra were obtained over an interval of 92 days .",

    "* ) on the telescope , on 2006 october 26 .",
    "an astrometric solution between the individual frames and the 2mass catalog was carried out using first order polynomials based on @xmath22400 stars per frame .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using a series of apertures in fixed positions around the 2mass - based @xmath23 pixel coordinates .",
    "we selected a frame taken near the meridian and used @xmath22260 stars and their magnitudes as measured on this reference frame to transform all other frames to a common instrumental magnitude system .",
    "the aperture yielding the lowest scatter outside of transit was used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the light curve was then de - correlated against trends using the out - of - transit sections and a dependence on hour angle ( see fig .  [",

    "a follow - up keplercam observation was recently obtained ( 2007 sep 4 ) , for the purpose of improving the photometric accuracy of the transit curve model , and also to determine the orbital period and mid - transit time with maximum accuracy .",

    "the characteristics of the red noise component of the residuals were preserved by perturbing only the phase of their fourier spectrum .",
    "we found that this method of error estimation is preferable to direct estimation using the mcmc method , since it is not sensitive to the number of out - of - transit points used .",
    "we also note that instead of @xmath63 and @xmath67 , we used the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the fit , where @xmath70 is an auxiliary variable with dimensions of velocity , defined by @xmath71 .",
