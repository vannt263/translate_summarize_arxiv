    "we study in nlo the photoproduction of both the isolated ( prompt ) photon and isolated ( prompt ) photon plus a jet without the small cone approximation .",

    "in our previous papers  @xcite we have discussed the nlo calculation of the cross section of the isolated photon production in the @xmath0 collision .",
    "the set of contributing diagrams was different than in nlo calculations of other authors  @xcite , since we assumed that parton densities in the photon were of order @xmath12@xmath13 , while in the cited papers their were assumed to be of order @xmath12@xmath14 .",
    "the parton densities inside the photon are proportional to the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath15 , and to the logarithm of the energy scale @xmath16 at which the densities are probed , @xmath17   in sec .",

    "this logarithm is formally proportional to @xmath18 but it originates from the pure electromagnetic process , @xmath19 , with no strong interactions , and therefore the parton densities in the photon should be treated as quantities of order @xmath12@xmath13 , and not @xmath12@xmath14 .",
    "this different treatment of parton densities leads to different set of diagrams in nlo calculations involving resolved photons , and to some moderate differences in numerical predictions in comparison with predictions of other authors  @xcite .    in the present calculation",
    "we take into account the same set of contributing partonic processes as it was taken in  @xcite , namely : the born diagram ( @xmath20 ) together with qcd corrections , the box diagram ( @xmath21 )  @xcite , processes with the resolved initial or final photon , and processes with resolved both the initial and final photon . the general formula for the differential cross section for the @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) photoproduction is : [ epa ] d^epe(jet ) x = g_/e(y ) d^p(jet ) x dy  , and d^p(jet ) x= _ a=,q,|q , g dx _ _ b = q,|q , g dx _ c=,q,|q , g f_a/(x_,^2)[cross ] f_b / p(x,^2 ) d_/c(z,^2 ) d^abcd_1 + _ b = q,|q , g dx f_b / p(x,^2 ) d^bd_1d_2  , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the partonic processes .",

    "the inclusive @xmath51-jet finding algorithm  @xcite is employed .",

    "now , we make short comparison with the nlo predictions of fontannaz , guillet and heinrich ( fgh )  @xcite presented in  @xcite .",
    "the fgh calculation takes into account the qcd corrections to the resolved - photon processes , which are not included in the calculation presented herein ( see sec .",
    "[ nlo ] and ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "they also use parton parametrizations different than the grv ones used by us .    in the considered kinematic range",
    "the total cross section of fgh is about 6% lower than our predictions .",
    "however differences are larger for the differential cross sections .",
    "for example , the fgh cross sections are lower by about 20% for @xmath110 and @xmath141 at @xmath142 gev and @xmath143 , respectively , and they give better agreement with the data . on the other hand , our predictions for @xmath141 ( @xmath144 )",
    "slightly better describes the data at @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) , where fgh predictions are about 45% ( 13% ) higher than ours . in other",
    "kinematic ranges the differences between calculations are not larger than @xmath12915% ( usually below 10% ) , and both calculations lead to a similar description of the preliminary h1 data , although the @xmath147 distribution of fgh is a bit more flat and more consistent with data in shape .",
    "we presented the results of the nlo calculation of the cross section for the photoproduction of the prompt photon and prompt photon plus jet at the @xmath0 collider desy hera .",
    "a new exact calculation for the prompt photon production was performed .",
    "we found that the predictions agree within 2% with the results obtained in the small cone approximation used in our previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper was a detailed analysis of the prompt photon plus jet production in nlo .",
    "( in the previous analysis  @xcite we presented only the lo predictions . ) the dependence on the choice of parton distribution functions was found to be of order 10% .",
    "the uncertainties due to the variation of the renormalization / factorization scale are of order @xmath129 5% , and it may indicate that the corrections of higher orders are small . but for relatively low @xmath116 , @xmath148 , the nlo corrections are very large while the lo contribution is suppressed , and we expect that in this region the corrections of higher orders could change the predictions .",
    "our predictions are in reasonably agreement with the h1 preliminary data  @xcite , nevertheless in some kinematic ranges there are discrepancies up to two standard deviations .    differences between our predictions and the predictions of fontannaz , guillet and heinrich  @xcite presented in  @xcite are usually below 10% , but in some kinematic limits they are larger .",
    "the largest differences , up to 45% at large @xmath130 , are seen for the @xmath149 distribution .",
    "the experimental errors are too large to conclude which calculation gives better description of the h1 preliminary data .",
