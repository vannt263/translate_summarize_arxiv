    "in the last few years , a new population of eclipsing binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) has emerged .",
    "although the range of orbital period spanned by these systems is similar to that of  black widow \" msps ( @xmath8  hrs ) , their companion masses ( @xmath9 ) are significantly larger than that of black widows ( @xmath10 ) ( roberts 2013 ) .",
    "this population is dubbed as  redbacks \" .",
    "chen et al . (",
    "2013 ) suggest the determining factor for producing black widows or redbacks is the efficiency of companion evaporation .",
    "they further argue that redback systems do not evolve into black widows with time .",
    "more than a dozen of redbacks have been identified so far .",
    "psr  j1023 + 0038 is the first identified redback msp which provides evidence for the transition from an x - ray binary to a radio msp ( archibald et al .",

    "these systems are suggested to have their states possibly swinging between rotation and accretion power phases according to the mass transfer rate ( shvartsman 1970 ; burderi et al .",
    "recent observations of episodic accretion from the redbacks psr  j1023 + 0038 ( patruno et al . 2013 ; takata et al . 2013 ) and psr  j1824 - 2452i ( papitto et al . 2013 ) are consistent with this scenario .",
    "psr  j1723 - 2837 , which is a redback , has its radio and optical properties been recently reported ( crawford et al . 2013 ) .",

    "its rotational period and orbital period are 1.86  ms and 14.8  hr , respectively .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar is estimated as @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "the mass of its companion lies in a range of @xmath14 and optical spectroscopy indicates it is a g - type star .",
    "the pulsar follows a nearly circular orbit .",
    "the eclipse of radio pulses takes @xmath15 of the orbit which is twice the roche lobe size inferred for the companion ( crawford et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this letter , we report the results from our x - ray and @xmath0ray analysis of this system .",
    "psr  j1723 - 2837  has been observed by _ xmm - newton _ on 3 march 2011 for a total exposure of @xmath16  ks with all epic cameras operated in full frame mode ( obs . i d : 0653830101 ) which provides a fairly uniform orbital coverage . with the updated instrumental calibrations , we generated all the event files with xmm science analysis software ( xmmsas version 12.0.1 ) .",

    "all the epic data are found to be unaffected by ccd pile - up .",
    "we firstly searched for the orbital modulation in x - ray . before any temporal analysis performed , we have applied barycentric correction to the arrival times of all the events by using the updated planetary ephemeris jpl de405 .",
    "then we subtracted the background in the individual camera by adopting an annular region with inner / outer radius of 25  arcsec/45  arcsec centered at the pulsar position .",
    "although the soft proton flares have contaminated the data in several regions of the ccds , examining the light curve of the aformentioned small region - of - interest reveals no flare - like events .",
    "therefore , we keep all data in order to optimize the orbital coverage for the analysis . using the radio ephemeris for psr  j1723 - 2837  ( tab .  2 in crawford et al .",

    "the x - ray modulation can be clearly seen with all three cameras . in order to improve the photon statistics , we combine all the epic data and the resultant light curve is shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "we adopted the time of ascending node ( mjd 55425.320466 ) to be the epoch of phase zero .",
    "due to the incomplete orbital coverage after data filtering , there is gap at the orbital phase interval @xmath29 in this _ xmm - newton _ data .",

    ". however , in examining the x - ray orbital modulation at this interval , we can not identify any peculiar behavior .",

    "at a distance of 0.75  kpc , this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath46  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "we have also attempted to fit the x - ray spectrum of psr  j1723 - 2837  with thermal models . while a black body yields a reduced @xmath36  much larger than unity , the thermal bremsstrahlung model results in an unphysically high temperature ( @xmath47  kev ) .",
    "we proceeded to investigate if the spectral properties vary at different orbital phases .",
    "we have extracted the spectra from two phase ranges , 0.2 - 0.4 and 0.7 - 0.9 which encompass infc and supc respectively . for the infc interval , the best - fit yields an @xmath48  @xmath40 and @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding parameters for the supc interval are estimated as @xmath50  @xmath40 and @xmath51 . within the statistical uncertainties ,",
    "the spectral parameters inferred in these two intervals are consistent with the phase - averaged values .",
    "based on this _ xmm - newton _ observation , there is no evidence of x - ray spectral variability across the orbit of psr  j1723 - 2837 .",
    "_ chandra _ observed psr  j1723 - 2837  with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on 2012 july 11 ( obsid : 13713 ) .",
    "the orbital coverage is continuous with a sum of good time interval of 55ks , which is slightly more than one orbital cycle .",
    "the acis was operated with a sub - array mode to achieve a timing resolution of 0.4s .",
    "due to the loss of efficiency for the sub - array model , the effective exposure is shorter ( 49.9 ks ) .",
    "similar to the _ xmm - newton _ observation , we performed barycentric correction to the arrival times of all the events by using the updated planetary ephemeris jpl de405 .",
    "psr  j1723 - 2837  is clearly seen and is the brightest source in the image . in order to reduce the background",
    ", we limited our analysis in the 0.37 kev band . using a circular source region with a radius of 4 arcsec",
    ", there are 4468 counts for subsequent analysis .",
    "an annular source free region centered at psr  j1723 - 2837  was used for background subtraction .",
    "we extracted the 0.37 kev lightcurve of psr  j1723 - 2837 ; similar to the _ xmm - newton _ observation , the 14.8-hr orbital modulation is clearly seen ( see fig .",
    "although the number of counts is much less than that of _ xmm - newton _ , the lightcurve profile is consistent with the _ xmm - newton _",
    "in spite of the large error bars , it is worth noting that there is a hint for the dip at phase @xmath33 seen in the _ xmm - newton_.    for spectral analysis , we first investigated the phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "the spectrum can be well described ( @xmath36@xmath52 for 204 d.o.f ) with an absorbed power - law model with @xmath53@xmath40 and @xmath54 . the unabsorbed 0.310 kev flux is @xmath55 erg @xmath40 s@xmath13 .",
    "the spectrum of _ chandra _ is only slightly harder than that of _ xmm - newton_. since psr  j1723 - 2837  is bright for _ chandra _ , some pile - up may contaminate the spectral analysis .",
    "we also included a pile - up model and found that the pile - up fraction is only 1.7% and the spectral parameters are more or less the same .",
    "we then performed a phase - resolved spectroscopy using the same phase bins for infc and supc as in the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "both spectra can be fit with an absorbed power - law . for infc ,",
    "the best fit is @xmath56@xmath40 and @xmath57 , while for supc the corresponding parameters are @xmath58@xmath40 and @xmath59 . like in the _ xmm - newton _ data",
    ", there is no evidence for orbital dependent spectral variability .    for better constraining the infc and supc spectral shape",
    ", we simultaneously fitted the spectra obtained by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ in these two intervals .",
    "the cross - calibration was accounted by allowing the normalizations to be different for these two telescopes .",
    "assuming @xmath43 is variable at different orbital phases , we obtained @xmath60@xmath40 , @xmath61 and @xmath62@xmath40 , @xmath63 for infc and supc respectively .",
    "the spectral parameters inferred in these phase intervals can be reconciled within @xmath64 uncertainties .",
    "we have also explored the possibility that there is no significant variation of @xmath43 across the orbit .",
    "we jointly fitted individual power - law model to the infc and supc spectra with @xmath43 in the individual model tied together .",
    "this yields @xmath65@xmath40 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 for infc and supc respectively .",
    "the photon indices in these two intervals are consistent within @xmath34 uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we do not found any conclusive evidence of the spectral variation across the orbit .",
    "the @xmath68-ray data used in this work were obtained between 2008 august 4 and 2013 july 15 , which are available at the fermi science support center  .",
    "we used the fermi science tools v9r31p1 package to reduce and analyze the pass7 data in the vicinity of psr  j1723 - 2837 . to reduce the contamination from earth albedo @xmath68-rays , we excluded events with zenith angles greater than 100@xmath69 .",
    "we used events with energies between 100 mev and 300 gev in the binned likelihood analysis .",
    "the corresponding instrumental response functions were used .",
    "we first chose a rectangular region of dimension 28@xmath7028@xmath69 centered on the radio timing position as our region - of - interest ( roi ) .",
    "we subtracted the background contribution by including the galactic diffuse model ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ) and the isotropic background ( iso_p7v6source.txt ) , as well as all sources in the second fermi / lat catalog ( 2fgl ; nolan et al .",
    "2012 ) within the circular region of 25@xmath69 radius around psr  j1723 - 2837  in the background source model .",
    "we assumed the respective spectrum in the 2fgl catalog for the sources considered .",
    "the normalization of the diffuse components and spectral parameter values of sources within 5@xmath69 from psr  j1723 - 2837  were allowed to vary .    using the `` source''-class events and assuming a power - law spectrum at the pulsar position , the maximized test - statistic ( ts ) value ( mattox et al . 1996 ) we obtained for the psr  j1723 - 2837  position is 38.3 , corresponding to a detection significance of 6.2@xmath71 .",
    "the power - law index is @xmath72 .",
    "the photon flux from the power - law fit is @xmath73  photons  @xmath40  s@xmath13 , and the energy flux is @xmath74  erg  @xmath40  s@xmath13 , corresponding to the @xmath68-ray luminosity of @xmath75  erg  s  @xmath13 at a distance of 0.75  kpc .",
    "since it is uncertain how much the pulsar proper motion contributes to the spin - down rate , the resulting spin - down luminosity can be treated as an upper limit of the intrinsic spin - down luminosity .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 would be no smaller than @xmath772% of the intrinsic spin - down luminosity . attempts to fit the data using a power - law with an exponential cutoff at the psr  j1723 - 2837  position did not provide a constraining parameter set",
    ". we also chose different rois to verify our results .",
    "given the proximity of psr  j1723 - 2837  to the galactic center where the galactic @xmath68-ray diffuse background is high , we also performed a binned likelihood analysis using `` clean''-class events in a smaller roi of dimension 21@xmath7021@xmath69 centered on the radio timing position .",
    "the ts value thus obtained is 24.2 , corresponding to a detection significance of 4.9@xmath71 .",
    "taking into account the above likelihood results using `` source '' events and `` clean '' events as well as the @xmath68-ray count map shown in fig .",
    "3 , we believe that the detection of the @xmath68-ray source is robust .",
    "to better estimate the @xmath68-ray position , we performed an unbinned analysis of the front - converted `` clean''-class events larger than 500  mev using _ gtfindsrc _ , resulting in the position at ra(j2000)=260@xmath78906 , dec(j2000)=@xmath7928@xmath78631 , with statistical uncertainty 0.13@xmath69 at the 68% confidence level , which is consistent with the position of psr  j1723 - 2837 .",
    "the background - subtracted count map of the 2@xmath702@xmath69 region centered on the radio position , constructed using the `` clean '' class events , is shown in figure  [ gamma_cmap ] .    a nearby source in the first fermi catalog ( abdo et al . , 2010",
    ") , 1fgl  j1725.5 - 2832 , is only @xmath771@xmath69 away from psr  j1723 - 2837  ( see fig .",
    "[ gamma_cmap ] ) .",
    "we studied their relation by adding 1fgl  j1725.5 - 2832 to the background source model that had been used in the aforementioned analysis .",
    "it turned out that essentially the same group of photons contribute to the ts values of both sources .",
    "therefore , we treat 1fgl  j1725.5 - 2832 to be the same @xmath68-ray source associated with psr  j1723 - 2837 .    using the radio ephemeris reported in crawford et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we searched for possible @xmath68-ray variability related to the orbital modulation .",
    "we divided the photons into two phase - intervals , one centered at the supc ( 0.5 - 1.0 ) , the other centered at the infc ( 0.0 - 0.5 ) , and performed binned likelihood analysis for each group of photons , using `` source '' events and same analysis cuts and source model as described in the full - orbit analysis .",
    "no difference of the spectral parameters were found between supc and infc .",
    "we also searched for any periodic signals using @xmath80-test ( de jager & bsching 2010 ) . neither the @xmath68-ray periodicity related to the orbital period nor the rotation period was found .",
    "however , the bright galactic diffuse emission , uncertainties in the ephemeris used over the fermi data span , and small photon statistics from the source make our periodicity searches less sensitive .",
    "with a simple one - dimensional model ( takata et al . 2012 ) , we constrain the pulsar wind parameters of psr  j1723 - 2837 . since the radio eclipse at several ghz lasts only  15% of its orbit ( crawford et al .",
    "2013 ) , we may expect the shock wraps the companion star and its distance from the pulsar is on the order of the semi - major axis , which is @xmath81  cm , where @xmath82 is the orbital inclination angle . based on the measurement of the doppler velocity of the companion , crawford et al .",
    "( 2013 ) suggested the inclination angle of @xmath83 for psr  j1723 - 2837 .",
    "the radio eclipse also suggests the angle of flow from the companion star measured from the pulsar is @xmath84 .",
    "if the pulsar wind is emitted spherically then the fraction of the pulsar wind stopped by the outflow is @xmath85 .",
    "the magnetic fields upstream ( @xmath86 ) and behind ( @xmath87 the shock are estimated as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath71 is the ratio of the magnetic energy to kinetic energy of the cold relativistic pulsar wind and we assume it to be smaller than unity ( i.e. kinetically dominated flow ) . at the shock ,",
    "the pulsar wind particles are accelerated beyond the lorentz factor ( @xmath90 ) of the cold relativistic pulsar wind in the upstream region . for the maximum lorentz factor of the accelerated particles ,",
    "it is determined by balancing the accelerating time scale , @xmath91 , and the synchrotron cooling time scale , @xmath92 .",
    "the observed x - ray photon index @xmath93 may imply the power law index of the particle distribution at the shock is @xmath94 .",
    "for the usual power law index @xmath95 of the shock acceleration , this hard photon index in the spectrum will be reproduced if the typical synchrotron energy ( @xmath96 ) of the minimum lorentz factor @xmath90 is larger than 10  kev .",
    "the photons index changes from @xmath97 above @xmath96 to @xmath98 below @xmath96 .",
    "in such a case , the x - ray emission properties break the degeneracy of @xmath71 and @xmath90 in the emission model .",
    "for example , we can fit the observed properties @xmath99 and @xmath100 with ( @xmath101 . the predicted lorentz factor @xmath102 is similar to those of the original black widow pulsar psr b1957 + 20 ( wu et al .",
    "2012 ) . as there is no evidence of spectral break found in 0.3 - 10  kev , observations with state - of - the - art hard x - ray telescopes , _",
    "nustar _ and the upcoming astro - h will be important for constraining @xmath103 .",
    "because psr j1723 - 2837 follows an almost circular orbit , the shock distance from the pulsar does not vary across the orbit , suggesting the spectral properties of the intrinsic shock emissions do not modulate with the orbital phase .",
    "the variation of the observed flux will be caused by either doppler boosting effect with a mildly relativistic flow of the shocked flow or physical eclipse of the emission region .",
    "however , these two effects will not produce a significant variation in the spectrum .",
    "the observed amplitude ( see figure  1 ) implies the doppler factor is @xmath104 , which does not cause a significant change in the spectral shape .",
    "furthermore , the synchrotron cooling time scale of the particles that emit photons of energies @xmath105  kev is @xmath106s , which is longer than the crossing time scale of the emission region , @xmath107s .",
    "the distribution of the particles and therefore the spectral shape of x - ray emission in @xmath108 does not evolve in the emission region . as a result ,",
    "even if the partial region of the emission region is covered by the star , the observed spectral shape is the same with that for whole emission regions .    for black widow / redback pulsars , the magnetospheric emissions and pulsar wind emissions produce the gev gamma - rays . for the original black widow pulsar psr b1957 + 20 , wu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggested both the magnetospheric and the pulsar wind emissions contribute to the gev emissions seen by _",
    "fermi_. with the results described in section  2.3 , it is unclear which process operates for the observed gamma - rays for psr  j1723 - 2837 , because neither pulsar s spin period nor orbital modulation was founded in the current _ fermi _ data , and whether or not there is a cutoff in the spectrum is inconclusive .",
    "a single power - law feature in the observed spectrum in 0.1300  gev band would suggest that the gamma - rays are emitted by the pulsar wind particles accelerated at the shock . in this case",
    ", the synchrotron radiation process explains the observed emissions around 100  mev and the inverse - compton process off the stellar photons contributes to the emissions above @xmath109  gev .",
    "the shocked particles that emit the synchrotron photons will produce tev photons through the inverse - compton off the stellar photons , for which the effective temperature is @xmath110k .",
    "based on the calculation with the isotropic photon fields , we can estimate the flux above @xmath111gev as @xmath112 , which could possibly be measured by the planned cherenkov telescpe array ( cta ) .",
    "the measurement of the cta on the redback systems will provide us additional information such as lorentz factor of the relativistic pulsar wind and the maximum lorentz factor of the shocked particles , etc .",
