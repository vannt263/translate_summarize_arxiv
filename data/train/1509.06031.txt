    "in support of experiments of the fair ( facility for the research with antiprotons and ions ) at darmstadt@xcite and the ad ( antiproton decelerator ) at cern @xcite for antimatter investigations , it is of interest to continue our investigation on the annihilation between an antinucleon with nucleons or a nucleus that represent an important aspect of the interaction between antimatter and matter . a recent suggestion of using @xmath8 annihilation to study the @xmath9-@xmath2 oscillations @xcite provides an additional impetus to examine the annihilation between an @xmath2 and a nucleus . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we extended the glauber model for nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite to study the antiproton - nucleus annihilation process .",
    "the extended glauber model for the calculation of the @xmath10 annihilation cross section @xcite consists of treating the nucleon - nucleus collision as a collection of binary collisions , with appropriate shadowing and the inclusion of initial - state and in - medium interactions .",
    "the basic ingredients are the elementary @xmath3 and @xmath11 annihilation cross sections , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , together with initial - state coulomb interactions and the change of the momentum of the antinucleon inside the nuclear medium .",
    "the model provides an analytical and yet intuitive way to analyze @xmath0-nucleus annihilation processes .",
    "qualitative features were reproduced to give a general map of the annihilation cross sections as a function of nuclear mass numbers and collision energies .",
    "we would like to improve upon these earlier results on several important aspects . in our previous work ,",
    "the basic @xmath3 annihilation cross section , @xmath14 , was parametrized semiempirically as @xmath15 , the inverse of the relative velocity @xmath16 , and utilized in our investigation of the stability and the properties of matter - antimatter molecules @xcite .",
    "such a simple dependence arises from the nuclear interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the @xmath17-state and gives the main feature of the important momentum dependence of the annihilation cross section .",
    "higher partial waves are also present and it is necessary to includes them properly .",
    "in addition to the nuclear interaction , @xmath1 and @xmath0 also interact through the attractive coulomb interaction and @xmath14 is expected to behave as @xmath18 in the lowest energy region @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to examine the combined effects of the nuclear and coulomb interactions to see how the @xmath15 behavior of the @xmath3 annihilation cross section is modified in the lowest energy region . a proper treatment of the coulomb and nuclear interactions for @xmath14 will also lead to a better determination of @xmath19 , which is expected to vary as @xmath15 at the lowest energies .",
    "furthermore , in our earlier work in @xcite , @xmath20 was taken to be 4/5 , based on the experimental ratio @xmath21=@xmath22 for @xmath0 at rest and @xmath23 for @xmath0 in flight @xcite , and a model of nucleon - antinucleon annihilation by the annihilation of quark and antiquarks of the same flavor @xcite . because of the attractive coulomb interaction is present in @xmath24 annihilation but absent in @xmath11 annihilation , @xmath25 should be greater than @xmath13 and the ratio @xmath26 should be energy dependent .",
    "quark and antiquark can form a string and subsequently fragments , independent of the flavor contents of the quark and the antiquark .",
    "thus , the approximate fixed ratio of @xmath26 of ref .",
    "@xcite should be amended and its energy dependencies must be properly taken into account .    on the theoretical side , there is the pioneering prediction of pomeranchuk @xcite on the equality of the annihilation cross section for @xmath3 and @xmath11 at high energies .",
    "one can envisage a @xmath27-@xmath28 pairing model of nucleon - antinucleon annihilation in which the annihilation between a nucleon and an antinucleon takes place by pairing the valence quark of any flavor from the nucleon with any valence antiquark of any flavor from the antinucleon , with each @xmath27-@xmath28 pair forming a string that subsequently fragments to many @xmath29 pairs ( mesons ) , as in the string fragmentation in @xmath30 collisions @xcite . at high energies when",
    "the long range coulomb effects become unimportant , such a @xmath27-@xmath28 pairing model will predict the equality of @xmath31=@xmath32 because there are the same numbers of nine ways to combine the @xmath27 and @xmath28 pairs to form strings in @xmath33 and @xmath34 annihilations .",
    "an equality of @xmath35=@xmath36 at high energies will favor the @xmath27-@xmath28 pairing model and is consistent with pomeranchuk s prediction .",
    "it will exclude another annihilation model , as for example , the annihilation only by quarks of the same flavor @xcite .",
    "to test pomeranchuk s prediction and the annihilation models , we re - examine the basic cross sections of @xmath13 and @xmath14 to understand their similarities as well as their different energy dependencies .",
    "there are no experimental data of @xmath13 for the collision of a @xmath0 projectile with an isolated neutron target in free space .",
    "there are however experimental @xmath37 annihilation cross section data using a @xmath2 beam source ( from the @xmath38 reaction ) colliding on a liquid hydrogen target @xcite , which are better suited for nucleon - antinucleon annihilation studies than those of @xcite using the @xmath0-(@xmath39h ) annihilations .",
    "as @xmath40=@xmath41 , we shall therefore treat them equivalently and consider the problem of the annihilation of @xmath0 on @xmath9 to be equivalent to the problem of @xmath2 on the target proton @xmath1 .    to study the coulomb and nuclear interactions of an antinucleon on the proton target , we shall assume for simplicity a square well potential of a fixed depth for which analytical results can be readily obtained @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results and the comparison with experimental data allows one to draw a conclusion on pomeranchuk s prediction and the annihilation models . upon the determination of the improved basic @xmath42 and @xmath43 annihilation cross sections , they can then be used as the building blocks to evaluate the annihilation cross sections for antinucleons on a nucleus .",
    "it is worth pointing out that over the years , a large set of experimental data in the annihilation of nucleons and nuclei by @xmath44 and @xmath2 had been accumulated @xcite and analyzed theoretically @xcite .",
    "klempt , batty , and richard reviewed various phenomenological analyses of microscopic quark dynamics and symmetry considerations in nucleon - antinucleon annihilations .",
    "the roles of initial- and final - state interaction are also examined @xcite .",
    "a theoretical optical potential based on the glauber model @xcite has been developed by kuzichev , lepikhin and smirnitsky to investigate the antiproton annihilation cross sections of various nuclei at the momentum range of 0.70@xmath452.50 gev/@xmath6 @xcite . in this range of relatively high antiproton momenta",
    ", the glauber model gives a good agreement with the experimental data , with the exception of the deviations at the momentum of 0.7 gev/@xmath6 for heavy nuclei .",
    "batty , friedman , and gal have developed a unified optical potential approach for low - energy @xmath46 interactions with proton and with various nuclei using a density - folded optical potential @xcite .",
    "they found that even though the density - folding potential reproduces satisfactorily the @xmath46 atomic level shifts and widths across the periodic table for @xmath47@xmath4810 and the few annihilation cross sections measured on ne , it does not work well for he and li .",
    "galoyan , uzshinsky , and collaborators have previously investigated cross sections of various processes in @xmath49 collisions in many different mechanisms .",
    "they have used different parametrizations of the basic total and elastic @xmath49 cross sections in the glauber model and have successfully implemented these calculations in the geant4 program for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter in high - energy nuclear detector studies @xcite . in the low - momentum regime ( @xmath50 1 gev/@xmath6 ) , however , many questions remain open to provide additional motivation for the present study . for example , how does the electrostatic coulomb interaction between the collision pair affects the annihilation cross section as function of target mass @xmath47 and charge numbers @xmath51 , and the projectile momentum in the laboratory frame @xmath52 ? and at approximately what momentum the contributions of the coulomb interaction begins to be less effective ?",
    "this study attempts to address these questions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study the basic @xmath3 and @xmath11 annihilation cross sections by considering the effects of particles transmission through a nuclear potential barrier , initial - state coulomb interaction between the collision pair and relativistic two - body kinematics . as the results for",
    "the present survey will not be sensitive to the fine structure of the potential well , we shall assume a square well potential for which analytical results for the transmission coefficients are well known .",
    "the experimental @xmath3 and @xmath4 annihilation cross sections can be successfully described in terms of transmission coefficients of various partial waves and coulomb gamow factors . in sec .",
    "iii , the basic @xmath3 and @xmath4 cross sections obtained in the theoretical analysis is then included in the extended glauber model to calculate @xmath0-nucleus collisions .",
    "the expressions are given for the @xmath0-nucleus annihilation cross sections in terms of basic @xmath53-nucleon annihilation cross section , @xmath54 . in sec .",
    "iv , we assess the theory by comparing its numerical results to experimental data at both high and low energies , finally , we conclude the present study with some discussions in sec . v.",
    "to analyze the @xmath3 and @xmath4 annihilation cross section at a center - of - mass energy @xmath55 , we follow blatt and weisskopf @xcite to decompose the incoming plane waves into partial waves and we use the ingoing - wave strong absorption model to assume that a partial wave transmitted passing through the nucleon surface @xmath56 will lead to a reaction , which in our case is an annihilation . in the case of @xmath3 annihilation , there is in addition the initial - state coulomb interactions which can be taken into account through the coulomb gamow factor @xmath57 @xcite ( or the @xmath58-factor @xmath59 in @xcite ) .",

    "such model will explain the equality of @xmath168 and @xmath164 when the coulomb effects become negligible at high energies .",
    "it overturns our naive quark model for annihilation@xmath45with annihilation takes place by pairing only the quark and antiquark of the same flavor .",
    "subsequently , with the help of these elementary cross sections , the extended glauber model is used to evaluate the annihilation cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 interaction with other nuclear elements . for the case of @xmath162 interactions",
    ", we reproduced our previous results @xcite and again these annihilation cross sections are found to be in good agreement with the measurements . for the case of @xmath8 interactions , predictions of the annihilation cross section are found to be in good agreement for fe nuclei .",
    "however , for elements , c , al , cu , ag , sn and pb , agreement between the theory and experiments is found to be reasonable .    as it is now formulated",
    ", the behavior of the @xmath134 annihilation cross section at low energies varies as @xmath169 arising from the coulomb enhancement factor , in addition to the energy dependencies of the basic @xmath3 and @xmath11 annihilation cross sections as described in sec .",
    "because these basic @xmath3 and @xmath170 annihilation cross sections increase substantially as the collision energy decreases , the granularity nature of the individual @xmath3 and @xmath11 collisions may not play a significant role in low - energy annihilations .",
    "a macroscopic description of the nucleus as a single potential without a granular structure may alternatively be a reasonable formulation .",
    "it will be of interest to re - examine the antinucleon - nucleus cross section at very low energies in a new light , by extending the potential approach as formulated in section iii for @xmath3 and @xmath4 annihilations to @xmath134 and @xmath8 annihilations in low - energy collisions .",
    "future analysis along such lines will be of great interest .",
