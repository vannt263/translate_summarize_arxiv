    "with the successful running of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , we are entering a new age of high energy physics .",
    "it is highly anticipated that the last piece of the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson , would be discovered or ruled out about within a year , and new physics signals beyond the sm would appear soon . among the new physics",
    "is the unparticle @xcite .",
    "but it is quite different from other types of new physics .",
    "many kinds of new physics  supersymmetry or extra dimensions , etc .  involve some new sets of _ particles _ , while unparticles are not ordinary particles . in the unparticle scenario , there is a scale - invariant hidden sector which couples to the sm particles very weakly at some energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "when seen at low energy , the scale - invariant sector behaves in different ways from ordinary particles and it looks like a fractional number of particles , and hence dubbed as _",
    "unparticles_.    suppose that at some high energy @xmath1 , there is a ultraviolet ( uv ) theory in the hidden sector with the infrared ( ir)-stable fixed point .",
    "the interaction between the uv theory and the sm sector can be described by an effective theory formalism . below @xmath2 , a uv operator",
    "@xmath3 interacts with an sm operator @xmath4 through @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the scaling dimension of @xmath7 . through the renormalization flow",
    ", one can go down from @xmath2 to meet a new scale @xmath0 where the scale invariance emerges .",
    "it appears through the dimensional transmutation .",
    "below @xmath0 the theory is matched onto the above interaction with the new unparticle operator @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scaling dimension of @xmath8 and @xmath11 is the matching coefficient .",
    "so far there have been a lot of investigations about unparticles in every respect @xcite . among them",
    "is the spin-2 unparticle effects , or ungravity @xcite .",
    "ungravity is induced by a traceless tensor unparticle operator @xmath12 which couples to the energy - momentum tensor @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the determinant of the metric .",
    "one of the most important result of ungravity is the power law correction to the newtonian gravitational potential , of type @xmath17 , resulting in the enhancement of gravity .",
    "thus in the regime where the unparticle effect is strong , it is possible that black holes would be formed @xcite .",
    "this kind of ",
    "@xmath18-enhanced  black hole is very similar to the mini black holes in the extra - dimension scenarios @xcite .",
    "properties of the extra - dimensional black holes have been widely studied .",
    "one of them is the quasinormal modes of the @xmath19-dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal modes of black holes are a phase of damping oscillations of external fields or the metric itself which perturbs the black holes @xcite .",
    "this phase is governed by the complex quasinormal frequencies of the fields .",
    "the real part of the quasinormal frequency drives the field oscillations while the imaginary part is responsible for the damping . for a field",
    "whose time dependence is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the frequency , the imaginary part of @xmath21 must be negative to guarantee damping with time .",
    "( for rotating black holes the imaginary part could be positive in the case of superradiance where the rotation energy is extracted .",
    "see @xcite . )",
    "the quasinormal modes of a black hole contain characteristic features of the black hole , so it is quite challenging to examine the quasinormal modes of the @xmath18-enhanced black holes and compare them with those of the extra - dimensional black holes .",
    "one way of distinguishing the extra - dimensional black holes and the @xmath18-enhanced black holes is to study the aspects of hawking radiations of both types of black holes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose that the quasinormal modes are very useful ",
    "fingerprints  to do the work .",
    "especially , the constraints by the unitarity on @xmath10 @xcite are so strong .",
    "according to @xcite , unitarity requires @xmath22 for tensor unparticles .",
    "in this region it will be shown that some modes of field oscillations have @xmath23 , which is unphysical because the field is amplified with time , not damped .",
    "consequently some of the quasinormal modes are forbidden for the unparticle black holes , quite contrary to those of extra - dimensional black holes .    in the next section ,",
    "the @xmath18-enhanced black holes are described and the corresponding geometry is given .",
    "with the induced metric , we construct the master equations which govern the propagation of fields under the ungravity backgrounds . in sec .",
    "iii the results for the quasinormal modes of scalar , vector , and dirac fields are provided . to get the quasinormal frequencies we adopt the wkb approximation up to the 3rd order .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "the ungravity effects by tensor unparticles result in the modification of the gravitational potential as @xcite @xmath25~ , \\label{phiu}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the newtonian potential .",
    "we can consider the unparticle effects as a modification to the schwarzschild metric as follows @xcite : @xmath28 thus the metric is of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30~. \\label{hu}\\ ] ] for large @xmath31 , @xmath32 simply becomes the newtonian potential .",
    "but for sufficiently small @xmath31 , the unparticle effects dominate . in this case",
    "the potential looks like that of a higher - dimensional gravity .",
    "since the higher - dimensional potential behaves as @xmath33 in @xmath19-dimensions , one can easily find the correspondence @xmath34 in this analysis we will consider only the region where the ungravity effect is strong . in this region , @xmath35 is approximately @xmath36 which resembles the schwarzschild geometry in @xmath37 dimensions .",
    "now we consider the propagation of particles through the background of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) .",
    "a field of spin @xmath38 is factorized as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the radial and angular functions satisfy the `` master equations '' @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) can be written as a form of a one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the so - called `` tortoise '' coordinate . here",
    "the effective potential @xmath47 takes different forms for its spin @xmath48 as follows : @xmath49~,\\\\   v_{s=1}&=&\\frac{h}{r^2}\\ell(\\ell+1)~,\\\\   v_{s=1/2}&=&hk\\left[\\frac{k}{r^2}\\mp\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{r}\\right)\\right]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "the quasinormal modes satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath51 in the original coordinate @xmath31 , @xmath52 is the event horizon and @xmath53 is spatial infinity . thus the quasinormal mode is incoming at the event horizon and outgoing at infinity .",
    "note that the infinity is implied in the sense that the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ huapp ] ) is hold .",
    "for example , the 2nd and the 3rd terms of eq .",
    "( [ hu ] ) become comparable when @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( and gets larger for smaller @xmath10 ) , where @xmath56 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath57 current analysis will be done within this range of validity for simplicity .    to get the quasinormal mode frequencies",
    ", one can use the well - known wkb approximation since the effective potential @xmath47 has the positive - definite potential barrier . up to the 3rd order of accuracy ,",
    "the frequency is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the maximum height of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the second derivative of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath62 at the point @xmath63 which maximizes @xmath47 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the overtone number . here",
    "@xmath66 are the wkb corrections and their explicit forms can be found in @xcite .",
    "one can add higher order terms to eq .",
    "( [ wkb3 ] ) as in @xcite .    using eq .",
    "( [ wkb3 ] ) , we provide the quasinormal mode frequencies in tables i , ii , and iii . in the analysis",

    "this is quite a distinctive point compared with the brane - localized model @xcite . for scalar @xmath73 mode ,",
    "the quasinormal mode is allowed only for @xmath74 , and for scalar @xmath75 , the allowed region is @xmath76 .",
    "the scalar @xmath77 mode is a quasinormal mode for all the range of @xmath10 considered in this analysis .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ v ] , vector fields show much the same behavior as scalar ones except that quasinormal @xmath73 is allowed for @xmath78 and quasinormal @xmath75 is for @xmath79 . as for dirac fields ,",
    "quasinormal @xmath80 modes are allowed for @xmath81 and other modes are not .",
    "the imaginary parts of the quasinormal frequencies of brane - localized fields near higher - dimensional black holes show similar behaviors to figs .",

    "[ cf ] .",
    "imaginary parts of @xmath21 for scalar fields near higher - dimensional black hole backgrounds . ]    in fig .",
    "[ cf ] , all the modes of @xmath85 are quasinormal when @xmath86 , which corresponds to @xmath87 ( see fig .  [ v ] ) for ungravity backgrounds .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the quasinormal modes of particles in the unparticle - enhanced black hole background .",
    "the effects of tensor unparticles look like a slight modification to the schwarzschild metric of a spacetime with @xmath88 dimensions , and the black hole formation might be possible at the lhc without any extra dimensions .",
    "we have shown that the quasinormal spectrum is a good probe for the properties of the black hole background .",
    "basically unparticle - enhanced black holes can be considered as @xmath88-dimensional black holes .",
    "but there are two big differences .",
    "one is that @xmath10 can be any real number .",
    "for example if one finds a fractional number of extra dimensions by examining the quasinormal modes , then the background geometry is given by unparticles .",
    "the other is that many quasinormal modes are forbidden in the unparticle background by the unitarity bound .",
    "this is a crucial feature to distinguish unparticles from extra dimensions .",
    "current work is done for massless particles , but the extension to the massive fields is also promising as was done for the conventional black hole backgrounds . and including higher wkb corrections is quite straightforward to improve the accuracy .",
