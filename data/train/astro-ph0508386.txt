    "the individual orbits of fast - moving stars near the dynamical center of the milky way galaxy indicate the existence of a black hole of mass @xmath0 solar masses at the position of the radio / infrared source  @xcite .",
    "the angular scale occupied by the horizon of this black hole , @xmath1@xmath2 micro - arcseconds ( @xmath3as ) , is a factor of @xmath4 larger than the nuclear black hole in the distant galaxy m87 and orders of magnitude larger than all other known black holes .",
    "recent observations revealed infrared emission from the radio source  which flares on a timescale of tens of minutes , comparable to the horizon crossing time of accreting gas @xcite .",
    "this data has motivated an observational program to monitor shifts of tens of @xmath3as in the centroid of the infrared image of  due to an orbiting hot spot in the accretion flow during flares @xcite , using the newly constructed prima instrument on very large telescope ( vlt ) @xcite . in parallel , there are plans to image  at @xmath5as resolution with a very large baseline array ( vlba ) of observatories at sub - millimeter wavelengths @xcite , at which the accreting gas is expected to be optically - thin and the black hole shadow may be recovered @xcite .    the faint emission from  is commonly interpreted as a consequence of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the black hole @xcite .",
    "the observed break in the sub - millimeter spectrum is thought to signal the transition of the flow to the optically thin regime at wavelengths below the break .",
    "the flux below the break wavelength is expected to be dominated by emission from the vicinity of the black hole horizon , where general relativistic effects become significant .",
    "these effects result from the warping of spacetime by the black hole ( , gravitational redshift , rotation of polarization via parallel propagation ) and the rapid motion of the disk near the _ innermost stable circular orbit _",
    "( isco ; , doppler shift , beaming , lorentz boosted polarization vectors , . ) .",
    "although attempts have been made to incorporate these effects into the determination of the unpolarized spectrum in the optically thin limit @xcite , earlier studies have not included a complete treatment of the polarization spectrum and are not applicable to the sub - millimeter wavelength regime where the opacity is non - negligible .",
    "here we produce images for three variations on the model of @xcite , listed in table [ models ] , each adjusted to roughly fit the observed radio and infrared spectrum .",
    "the primary distinction between the different cases in table [ models ] is the black hole spin , ranging from non - rotating to maximally rotating ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this was done using the methods employed by @xcite and detailed in @xcite , and we direct the reader to these papers for more information . from the calculated images we compute the unpolarized and polarized spectra as well as the location of the image centroid as functions of frequency .",
    "ccccc @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 + @xmath12 & @xmath8 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath15 +    we model the structure of the accretion flow based on the results of @xcite , who showed that the vertically - averaged electron density and temperature could have a nearly power - law dependence on radius . here",
    "we write the density , @xmath20 , and temperature , @xmath21 , of the thermal electrons , as well as the density , @xmath22 , of non - thermal electrons , as having the spatial distribution @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cylindrical radius relative to the black hole spin axis , and the assumed constants are listed in table [ models ] for three fiducial black hole spins . in all models ,",
    "the non - thermal electrons have a spectral index of 1.25 and a minimum lorentz factor of 100 .",
    "the magnetic field strength is set to be a fixed fraction ( @xmath25 ) of equipartition relative to the protons and is chosen to be toroidal , as found in recent general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the accreting gas is assumed to be in free fall inside of the isco ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 , respectively ) , and in keplerian rotation otherwise . in all cases the disk angular momentum was aligned with the spin of the black hole .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , the photosphere becomes smaller at higher frequencies as expected .",
    "however , special relativistic aberration and the doppler effect make the photosphere asymmetric about the rotation axis of the accretion flow . at high frequencies ,",
    "the emission is dominated by a small region located on the approaching side of the disk .",
    "this has two immediate consequences : a high polarization at high frequencies ( 10 - 20% ) , and a definite shift in the image centroid as a function of black hole spin due to strong gravitational lensing . at frequencies @xmath30 the black hole `` shadow '' discussed by @xcite",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) becomes apparent .",
    "however , in contrast to previous work , the rotation of the disk makes the shadow highly asymmetric and even for the non - rotating case it only roughly follows the photon capture cross section ( shown by the white dashed line ) . because rotation is a generic feature of the accretion flow , it is unlikely that sub - millimeter imaging of  will show a well defined shadow , as suggested before based on a much more simplistic model for emissivity profile .    , short - dash ) , moderately rotating ( @xmath31 , long - dash ) and maximally rotating ( @xmath6 , solid ) black hole .",
    "the accretion disk models are listed in table [ models ] and the disk is viewed at an angle of @xmath32 . in all cases",
    "the spectra give an acceptable fit to the existing data with the maximally rotating black hole model giving the best fit .",
    "the polarization fraction appears to be a sensitive diagnostic of the spin of the black hole near @xmath33 and above @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "below @xmath36 it is believed that  is faraday depolarized , and thus our calculation ( in which faraday rotation was ignored ) is inapplicable .",
    "the data are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the polarization at high frequencies is a direct result of the localization of the emission evident in figure [ fig1 ] . ]",
    "the unpolarized and polarized spectra are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "high black hole spin ( and thus high keplerian velocity at the disk inner edge ) leads to a broadened sub - millimeter bump , yielding a marginally better fit to the data .",
    "given the current uncertainties inherent in modeling the inner edge of the accretion flow , this is not necessarily evidence for spin .",
    "however , it does demonstrate the importance of relativistic effects between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the polarized spectra shows the anticipated asymptotic behavior at high observing frequencies , which strongly discriminates between low and high spin black holes .",
    "in addition to the high frequency behavior there is a sub - millimeter bump in the polarization fraction as well .",
    "again the data appears to marginally favor high spin .",
    "however , in this case as well , there is significant uncertainty in the emission characteristics , most notably the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , our assumption of a toroidal field is likely to be justified in the inner regions of the disk due to the strong shear present in that region .    ) for the three models listed in table [ models ] viewed at an angle of @xmath32 .",
    "the position shifts are measured relative to the black hole ( where the @xmath39-axis is aligned with the black hole spin ) .",
    "the projection of the trajectories on the @xmath40 axis are shown as functions of frequency in the inset .",
    "for , the angular scale of the axes is @xmath41 times the black hole mass in units of @xmath42 . ]",
    "the position of the image centroids as a function of frequency is plotted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "as suggested by figure [ fig1 ] the image centroids asymptote to differing fixed positions at high frequencies .",
    "the asymptotic positions are determined by strong gravitational lensing , and thus are sensitive to the parameters of the black hole .",
    "in contrast , when the photosphere has a large radius ( , at low frequencies ) , the black hole spin has little influence and thus the image centroids become degenerate .",
    "the centroid location rapidly changes as the photosphere shrinks to the scale of the horizon .",
    "this necessarily occurs during the transition between the optically thick and the optically thin regimes .",
    "therefore , high precision absolute astrometry of the image centroids at radio and infrared wavelengths can constrain the black hole spin .    while quantitative differences exist for different magnetic field geometries in both the polarized spectra and the locations of the image centroids ,",
    "the qualitative characteristics ( which depend only upon the asymmetric opacity and relativistic effects ) remain the same . as a result ,",
    "detailed multi - wavelength studies of the polarization and image centroids provide a method by which the spin of the black hole at the galactic center may be measured .",
