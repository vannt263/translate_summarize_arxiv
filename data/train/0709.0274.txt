    "given a precompact domain @xmath1 in a riemannian manifold @xmath2 , the isoperimetric quotient for @xmath1 measures the ratio between the volume of the boundary and the volume of the enclosed domain : @xmath3 .",
    "these volume measures and this quotient are descriptors of fundamental importance for obtaining geometric and analytic information about the manifold @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , this holds true on every zoom level , be it global , local , or micro - local .",
    "a classical quest is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the _ type _ of a given manifold : is it hyperbolic or parabolic ? as already alluded to in the abstract , parabolicity is a first measure of the relative smallness of the boundary at infinity of the manifold : the brownian particles are bound to eventually return to any given neighborhood of their starting point - as in @xmath4 ; they do not get lost at infinity as they do in @xmath5 ( which the simplest example of a transient manifold ) .",
    "+ in @xcite t. lyons and d. sullivan collected and proved a number of equivalent conditions ( the so - called kelvin  nevanlinna ",
    "royden criteria ) for non - parabolicity , i.e. hyperbolicity : the riemannian manifold @xmath6 is hyperbolic if one ( thence all ) of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied : ( a ) @xmath2 has _ finite resistance _ to infinity , ( b ) @xmath2 has _ positive capacity _ , ( c ) @xmath2 admits a _ green s function _ , ( d ) there exists a precompact open domain @xmath1 , such that the brownian motion starting from @xmath1 does _ not return _ to @xmath1 with probability @xmath0 , ( e ) @xmath2 admits a _ square integrable vector field _ with finite , but non - zero , absolute divergence .",
    "in particular the capacity condition ( b ) implies that @xmath6 is parabolic if it has vanishing capacity - a condition which we will apply in section [ seccapanalysis ] .",
    "+ returning now to the role of isoperimetric information : j. l. fernandez showed in @xcite that @xmath2 is hyperbolic if the so - called ( rooted ) isoperimetric profile function @xmath7 has a quare integrable reciprocal , i.e. @xmath8 . here the @xmath9rooted profile function is molded directly from isoperimetric information as follows : @xmath10 the volume of a non - parabolic manifold @xmath2 is necessarily infinite .",
    "in fact , a finite volume manifold is parabolic by the following theorem due to grigoryan , karp , lyons and sullivan , and varopoulos .",
    "see @xcite section 7.2 for an account of this type of results , which again is stated in terms of the simplest possible isoperimetric information : let @xmath11 denote the geodesic ball centered at @xmath12 in @xmath2 and with radius @xmath13 .",
    "if there exists a point @xmath12 such that one ( or both ) of the following conditions is satisfied @xmath14 then @xmath2 is parabolic . + in the present paper we obtain generalizations of this parabolicity condition .",
    "they are obtained for submanifolds in ambient spaces with a _ lower bound _ on curvatures by using a capacity comparison technique in combination with the kelvin ",
    "nevanlinna  royden condition ( b ) as stated above , see proposition [ propballcond ] and theorem [ thmspherecondgen ] .",
    "these results complement - and are in a rough sense dual to - previous hyperbolicity results that we have obtained using a corresponding _ upper bound _ on the curvatures of the ambient spaces , see @xcite .",
    "if the boundary of a given domain is relatively small as compared to the domain itself , we also expect the mean exit time for brownian motion to be correspondingly larger .",
    "the main concern of the present paper is to show an upper bound on the isoperimetric quotients of the so - called extrinsic balls of submanifolds under the essential assumption that the ambient spaces have a _ lower bound _ on their curvatures , see theorem [ thmisopgeneral ] .",
    "the result for the mean exit time ( from such extrinsic balls ) then follows , as observed and proved in theorem [ thmexittime ] .",
    "these results are again dual to results which have been previously obtained under the condition of an upper bound on the curvature of the ambient space , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively .      when considering again the intrinsic geodesic balls @xmath15 of @xmath2 centered at a fixed point @xmath12 and assuming that the radius @xmath16 is approaching @xmath17 , then the taylor series expansion of the volume function of the corresponding metric ball ( or metric sphere ) contains information about the curvatures of @xmath2 at @xmath12 - a classical result ( for surfaces ) obtained by gauss and developed by a. gray and l. vanhecke in their seminal work @xcite .",
    "moreover , the geodesic metric balls have been analyzed by a. gray and m. pinsky in @xcite in order to extract the geometric information contained in that particular function of @xmath18 , which gives the mean exit time from the center point @xmath12 of the metric ball @xmath15 , see theorem [ thmgrap ] below in section [ secexittime ] .",
    "+ to motivate even further the _ extrinsic geometric _ setting under consideration in the present paper , we mention here also yet another nice observation due to l. karp and m. pinsky concerning submanifolds in @xmath19 ; see @xcite , where they show how to extract combinations of the principal curvatures of a submanifold at a point @xmath12 from suitable power series expansions of the respective functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the extrinsic ball of ( extrinsic ) radius @xmath16 centered at @xmath12 , and @xmath24 is the mean exit time function .",
    "+ on all levels then , be it global , local , or micro - local , as well as from both viewpoints , intrinsic or extrinsic , we thus encounter a fundamental interplay and inter - dependence between the highly instrumental geometric concepts of measure , shape , and diffusion considered here , namely the notions of volume , curvature , and exit time , respectively .",
    "+      in the first three sections [ secfirstglimpse ] , [ secprevres ] , and [ secexampsurfofrev ] , we first provide intuitive versions , shadows , of our main results , i.e. we present the general results under stronger conditions than actually needed and compare them in particular with previous techniques for obtaining parabolicity ( for surfaces of revolution ) due to j. milnor and k. ichihara . in section [ secgeobounds ]",
    "we then begin to establish the technical machinery for the paper and give precise definitions of the geometric bounds needed as preparation for our definition of what we call an isoperimetric constellation in section [ secisopconstellation ] .",
    "this key notion is then applied in section [ secmainisopres ] to present and prove our main isoperimetric result , theorem [ thmisopgeneral ] .",
    "various consequences of the main result and its proof are shown in sections [ secconseq ] and [ secintrinsic ] .",
    "in particular we find new inequalities involving the volumes of extrinsic balls and their derivatives as well as intrinsic versions of our main results . in section [ secexittime ]",
    "we find a lower bound on the mean exit time function from extrinsic balls , and establish in section [ seccapanalysis ] an inequality for the capacities of extrinsic annular domains , which is then finally applied to prove the parabolicity result , theorem [ thmspherecondgen ] , as alluded to above .",
    "we first facilitate intuition concerning our main results by considering some of their consequences for submanifolds in constant curvature ambient spaces - in particular for surfaces in @xmath5 .",
    "this seems quite relevant and worthwhile , because even in these strongly restricted settings we find results , which we believe are of independent interest .",
    "the results presented here are but shadows of the general results .",
    "the full versions of the main theorems appear in the sections below as indicated in the outline , section [ subsecoutline ] .",
    "+      the general strong conditions applied for these initial statements are as follows : we let @xmath25 denote a complete immersed submanifold in an ambient space form @xmath26 with constant sectional curvature @xmath27 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath28 is _ radially mean @xmath29convex _ in @xmath30 as viewed from a point @xmath31 in the following sense : the unique oriented , arc length parametrized geodesic @xmath32 from @xmath31 to @xmath33 in the ambient space @xmath34 has an inner product with the mean curvature vector @xmath35 of @xmath28 in @xmath30 at @xmath36 , which is bounded as follows : @xmath37 for some constant @xmath38 .",
    "this condition with @xmath39 is e.g. satisfied by _ convex _",
    "hypersurfaces , see remark [ remhypcon ] , as well as by all _ minimal _ submanifolds .",
    "we then consider a special type of compact subsets of @xmath28 , the so - called extrinsic balls @xmath40 , which for any given @xmath41 consists of those points @xmath36 in @xmath28 , which have extrinsic distance to @xmath31 less than or equal to @xmath42 , see figure 1 . +     from a paraboloid and from a minimal surface , respectively .",
    "both extrinsic discs are radially mean @xmath43convex from the center point of the cutting sphere .",
    "theorem [ thmaisop ] provides an upper bound on the isoperimetric quotients for the respective extrinsic discs , cf .",
    "remark [ remsurfisop].,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   from a paraboloid and from a minimal surface , respectively .",

    "+ with these initial ingredients and concepts we can now state the following first instances of our main theorems :    [ thmaisop ] if we assume the strong conditions stated above in section [ subsecstrong ] , then the following upper bound on the isoperimetric quotients for extrinsic balls holds true for @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the constant mean curvature of the metric hyper - sphere of radius @xmath42 in the space form of constant curvature @xmath58 ( see ( [ eqhbversuswarp ] ) ) ; this function has @xmath59 .",
    "[ remsurfisop ] for the surfaces displayed in figure 1 the isoperimetric inequality reads as follows ( since @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) : @xmath62 where @xmath47 is the lower bound of the tangency function @xmath48 along the boundary curve @xmath44 of the extrinsic disc , see ( [ eqtangency ] ) and ( [ eqtangencybound ] ) .",
    "[ thmaexit ] we assume the strong general conditions stated above in section [ subsecstrong ] .",
    "then the mean exit time @xmath63 , i.e. the time that it takes ( on average ) for a brownian particle starting from a point @xmath64 to reach the boundary @xmath44 enjoys a lower bound of the following radial type : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a well defined radial function , which only depends on @xmath42 , @xmath58 , @xmath38 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the precise form of this dependence will , of course , be substantially explicated below , see section [ secexittime ] and theorem [ thmexittime ] therein .",
    "[ thmaparab ] we assume the strong general conditions stated above in section [ subsecstrong ] for all radii @xmath42 of the extrinsic disc @xmath49 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath68 then @xmath25 is parabolic .    in particular , we may , and do , extract the following first corollaries directly from the above theorem .",
    "[ coraparab ] let @xmath69 denote a two - dimensional radially mean @xmath43 convex surface in euclidean space @xmath70 with a radial tangency bounding function @xmath67 which satisfies the following inequality for all sufficiently large @xmath13 : @xmath71 then @xmath69 is parabolic .",
    "[ remzero ] this particular result should be viewed in the light of the fact that there are well known minimal ( hence @xmath43convex ) surfaces in @xmath5 - like scherk s doubly periodic minimal surface - which are non - parabolic ( i.e. hyperbolic ) , but which nevertheless also - in partial contrast to what could be expected from the above corollary - support radial tangency functions @xmath72 which are mostly close to @xmath0 at infinity .",
    "the scherk surface alluded to is the graph surface of the function @xmath73 , which is smooth and well - defined on a checkerboard pattern in the @xmath74plane .",
    "it was proved in @xcite - via methods quite different from those considered in the present paper - that scherk s surface is hyperbolic .",
    "roughly speaking , the scherk s surface may be considered as the most slim known hyperbolic surface in @xmath5 .",
    "if that surface is viewed from a point far away from the @xmath75plane , the surface looks like two sets of parallel half - planes , both orthogonal to the @xmath75plane , one set below and the other above , and the two sets being rotated @xmath76 with respect to each other , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the radial tangency ( from any fixed point @xmath31 in the @xmath75plane ) is mostly close to @xmath0 at infinity except for the points in the @xmath75plane itself , where the tangency function is wiggling sufficiently close to @xmath17 , so that the condition [ eqcora ] can not be satisfied .",
    "in fact , if we accept for a moment the rough description of the surface as two sets of parallel half planes , then the integral over an extrinsic disc @xmath40 of the tangency function @xmath72 from @xmath77 is roughly @xmath78 for large values of @xmath42 .",
    "note that for this simplified calculation the extrinsic disc consists of a finite number of flat half - discs , each one of which has radius @xmath79 , where @xmath80 denotes the orthogonal distance to @xmath31 from the plane containing the half - disc .",
    "we have discussed this particular example at some length , because it seems to be a good example for displaying in purely geometric terms what goes on at or close to the otherwise still quite unknown borderline between hyperbolic and parabolic surfaces in @xmath5 . in other words ,",

    "therefore , in relation to the discussion in the previous remark [ remzero ] , what induces parabolicity in negatively curved ambient spaces is to a large extent the radial mean @xmath92convexity assumption - not just the tangency condition @xmath93 .",
    "with @xmath94 we have @xmath95 and since @xmath96 is designed to satisfy @xmath97 for sufficiently large values of @xmath13 , say @xmath98 , we get for some positive constant @xmath99 : @xmath100 so that , for some other positive constant @xmath101 : @xmath102 which then implies parabolicity according to theorem [ thmaparab ] .    the proof of corollary [ corbparab ] follows essentially verbatim , except for handling the allowed @xmath29interval for given @xmath58 and @xmath103 .",
    "the condition ( [ eqbccondition ] ) simply stems from the two obvious conditions , that the square root defining @xmath96 in ( [ eqgtildeb ] ) must be well - defined and less than @xmath0 .",
