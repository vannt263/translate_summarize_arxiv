    "in high energy hadron - hadron collisions , more than one parton in each of the hadron can contribute to the cross section .",
    "this is the multiple partonic interactions ( mpi ) phenomenon which , even if its contribution is suppressed by a power of @xmath0 with respect to the single parton interaction , with @xmath1 the center - mass energy in the collision , has been already observed ( see , , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "mpi represent a background for the search of new physics , , at the lhc . in this work",
    "we focus our attention to the double parton scattering ( dps ) which can be observed in many channels , , @xmath2 with dilepton productions and double drell - yan processes ( see , _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . at the lhc , dps ,",
    "whose evidence has been observed @xcite , represents also a background for higgs production . in this framework",
    "the dps cross section can be written , following @xcite , in terms of the so called double parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) , @xmath3 , which describe the joint probability of finding two partons of flavors @xmath4 with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath5 and transverse separation @xmath6 inside the hadron : @xmath7    the partonic cross sections @xmath8 refer to the hard , short - distance processes , @xmath9 is a symmetry factor , present if identical particles appear in the final state and @xmath10 is the renormalization scale which is taken , for simplicity , to be the same for both partons . for the evaluation of the dps contributions to proton - proton scattering at lhc kinematics , the following approximation , for the dpdf ,",
    "is usually made :    @xmath11    _ i.e. _ , a complete factorized form of the dpdf is assumed .",
    "in particular the @xmath12 and @xmath13 dependences are factorized and the standard single parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath14 , are introduced .",
    "this means that possible double parton correlations between the two interacting partons are neglected .",
    "dpdfs are non perturbative quantities so that they can not be easily evaluated in qcd .",
    "as it happens for the pdf , a useful procedure for their estimate is a calculation at the hadronic scale , @xmath15 , by means of quark models . in order to compare the obtained results with data taken , ,",
    "at high energy scales , @xmath16 , it is necessary a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) evolution of the model calculations , using the dpdfs evolution equations known since a long time ago @xcite . by using this procedure , future data analysis of the dps processes",
    "could be guided , in principle , by model calculations .",
    "the first model evaluations of the dpdf have been the ones in refs.@xcite . in the first scenario use",
    "has been made of a modified version of the mit bag model in the cavity - approximation in order to introduce double parton correlations by hand , recovering momentum conservation .",
    "in the second case the dpdfs have been calculated in a non relativistic ( nr ) constituent quark model ( cqm ) framework , since cqm , in the valence region , predict pdfs , generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) rather well ( see , , refs .",
    "these expectations motivated the analysis of refs . @xcite and the present one .",
    "the main results found in refs .",
    "@xcite are that , in the valence quark region , the approximations used to write eq .",
    "( [ app ] ) are badly violated . in the cqm picture , where the dynamical origin of double correlations is clear",
    ", the origin of this violation can be properly understood .",
    "one should notice that both the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite have some inconsistencies .",
    "first , dpdf do not vanish in the non physical region , @xmath17,_i.e .",
    "_ , they have a wrong support .",
    "moreover , as already pointed out , in order to obtain some information on the dpdf at small values of @xmath18 and at high @xmath19 , where lhc data are taken , the pqcd evolution of the calculated dpdf is necessary . in a recent paper of ours @xcite , a cqm calculation of the dpdf",
    "has been performed including relativity through a fully poincar covariant light - front ( lf ) approach .",
    "thanks to this treatment it is possible to study strong interacting systems with a fixed number of on - shell constituents ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for general reviews ) .",
    "moreover , being the hyperplane of the lf , _",
    "i.e. _ , the plane where the initial conditions are defined , tangent to the light - cone , the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) phenomenology is automatically included into the scheme . in particular , in this framework , which has been used extensively for hadronic calculations , ( see , , refs .",
    "@xcite , some symmetries of the dpdf are restored and the bad support problem is fixed , so that the pqcd evolution of the ddpdfs is more precise .",
    "the results of this analysis will be summarized in the following sections .",
    "in this section the procedure adopted for the lf calculation of the dpdfs will be presented .",
    "the validity of the approximations eq .",
    "( [ app ] ) in this relativistic scenario will be checked . to this aim",
    ", the lf approach has been chosen due to its nice properties , in particular the fact that lf boosts and plus component of the momenta ( @xmath20 ) are kinematical operators .",
    "the fourier- transform of the dpdf -0.83 cm @xmath21 will be analized . in the above equation ,",
    "the dpdf is introduced for two quarks of flavors @xmath22 and @xmath23 and helicities @xmath24 , respectively . the full procedure of the calculations of the dpdf in the lf approach , starting from the formal definition of this quantity , and thanks to a proper extension of the proceeding presented in ref .",

    "the latter quantity is written as a sum over partonic fock states with all the correct normalizations preserved . in the lfwf representation , only the first term of this summation , representing the contribution of the valence quarks , has been taken into account . a crucial point of the procedure is the possibility of describing the lf proton state starting from the instant form ( canonical ) one , where most quark models are developed . to this",

    "the evolution equations are obtained as a direct generalization of the well known dglap ones , see refs . @xcite .",

    "the main achievement is the fully poincar covariance of the description , which allows to restore the expected symmetries , and the vanishing of the dpdf in the forbidden kinematical region , @xmath63 . in the analysis of the dpdfs at the hadronic scale we found that the approximations of these quantities with a complete factorized ansatz , in the @xmath13 and @xmath64 dependences , is violated , in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
