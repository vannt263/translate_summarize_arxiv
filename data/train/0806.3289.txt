    "we have not examined the magnification of the strongly demagnified relativistic images .",
    "in this work we discussed the features of light propagation in the spacetime of a stationary , axially - symmetric black hole and naked singularities . modelling the massive compact object in the center of the galaxy as a rotating generalization of the janis  newman  winicour naked singularity , we estimate the numerical values of the deflection angle of the light ray for the kerr black hole , wns and sns . provoking from the weak deflection limit analysis , basing on the degeneracy of a rotating singularity lens and a displaced janis ",
    "newman  winicour lens we derived analytical descriptions for the two weak field images , the critical curves , the caustic points , the signed magnifications and the total magnification as well as the magnification centroid up to post - newtonian order .",
    "moreover , in our striving to study the gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit , we evaluated the strong deflection limit coefficients of the deflection angle for the wns , and the lensing observables ensuing from them . when comparing the results to the corresponding quantities for a rotating naked singularity and kerr black hole , we find that there are rotation and scalar field effects present in the behavior of the bending angle of the light ray , as well as the lensing observables .",
    "the analytical results show that there are a static post - newtonian corrections to the two weak field image positions , to the signed magnification and to their sum as well as to the critical curves , which are function of the scalar charge .",
    "the shift of the critical curves as a function of the lens angular momentum is found , and it is shown that they decrease slightingly for the weakly naked and vastly for the strongly naked singularities with the increase of the scalar charge .",
    "the point - like caustics drift away from the optical axis and do not depend on the scalar charge . in the static case of janis  newman ",
    "winicour lensing the scalar charge leads to increases of the signed magnifications for arbitrary source position .",
    "however , when the source is equatorial ( _ i.e. _ @xmath120 ) , with the increase of the scalar charge the total magnification @xmath145 decreases for a source on the right hand side of the optical axis ( _ i.e. _ @xmath133 ) and increases when the source is on the left hand side ( _ i.e. _ @xmath132 ) .",
    "the non - equatorial source position leads only to an increase of the total magnification for fixed @xmath126 .    in the case of rotating naked singilarity lensing , the point - like caustic @xmath254 drift away from the optical axis and some corrections with respect to janis",
    "winicour lensing have arisen .",
    "when the source is equatorial , for every values of @xmath115 , the positive parity @xmath119 and negative parity @xmath114 magnifications respectively increases and decreases with the increase of @xmath126 with respect to signed magnifications in the static case .",
    "the non - equatorial source position leads to an increase of @xmath119 for @xmath133 and to decrease of it for @xmath132 with respect to the static case .",
    "@xmath114 has a opposite behavior with respect to @xmath119 . in",
    "this cases the scalar charge increases the signed magnifications for all values of lens angular momentum @xmath6 and source positions @xmath255 , @xmath256 .",
    "the total magnification remind the behavior of positive parity magnification @xmath119 , with the difference that for a fixed @xmath6 with the increase of the scalar charge @xmath145 increases for @xmath133 and decreases for @xmath132 . looking from the observer position the magnification centroid @xmath150",

    "the lens angular momentum @xmath6 leads to an increase of the centroid for @xmath133 and to decrease of it for @xmath132 .    let us to resume the strong deflection limit results .",
    "because of the existence of the photon sphere in the case of the kerr black hole and rotating wns , gravitational lensing gives rise to a sequence of an infinite number of highly demagnified relativistic images distributed respectively on the each side of the optical axis . in the case of janis  newman ",
    "winicour sns when @xmath23 and @xmath257 the gravitational lensing does not give relativistic images because of the non - existence of a photon sphere .",
    "in the rotational case of wns the position of the relativistic images decreases with the increase of @xmath175 for all values of the scalar charge and all of the images are closer to the center of the lens in comparison to the kerr images . for all values of @xmath126",
    "the relativistic images are closer to the optical axis for positive @xmath6 in the case of direct photons and further from the optical axis for negative @xmath6 when we consider opposite photons .",
    "for the static case when janis ",
    "winicour wns are realized the relativistic images are not shifted .",
    "therefore as seen from the side of the observer the relativistic images are shifted towards the western side , if north is the direction of the spin .",
    "the gap between the outermost relativistic image and the remaining ones packed together at inner image position increases with the increase of @xmath175 for all values of the scalar charge . in the vicinity at @xmath23 , where the sdl approximation works sufficiently , the wns separability @xmath252 exceeds the kerr black hole separability . while for bigger positive angular momentum the dependence is the same , for negative angular momentum , a value @xmath253 exist after which the image separability is lower in comparison to the kerr black hole separability .    according to the results , the gravitational lensing in the weak and",
    "the strong deflection limit would allow us to distinguish the kerr black hole from rotating weakly naked singularities .",
    "hence , detecting the weak field or / and the relativistic images , which might be possible in the near future , we will be able to determine the nature of the lensing galactic massive dark object .",
