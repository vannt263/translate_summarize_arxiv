    "recently the growth of rough interfaces has witnessed an explosion of theoretical , numerical , and experimental studies , fueled by the broad interdisciplinary aspects of the subject @xcite .",
    "applications can be so diverse as imbibition in porous media , fluid  fluid displacement , fire front motion , and the motion of flux lines in superconductors @xcite",
    ".    in general , a @xmath13-dimensional self - affine interface , described by a single - valued function @xmath14 , evolves in a @xmath15-dimensional medium .",
    "usually , some form of disorder @xmath16 affects the motion of the interface leading to its roughening .",
    "two main classes of disorder have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the first , called thermal or `` annealed , '' depends only on time .",
    "the second , referred to as `` quenched , '' is frozen in the medium .",
    "early studies focused on _ time - dependent _ disorder as being responsible for the roughening @xcite . here",
    ", we consider in detail the effect of _ quenched _ disorder on the growth .",
    "the presence of quenched disorder introduces an interesting analogy between the motion of driven interfaces in disordered media and the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "the continual motion of the interface requires the application of a driving force @xmath17 .",
    "there exists a critical force @xmath18 , such that for @xmath19 , the interface will become pinned by the disorder after some finite time . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the interface moves indefinitely with an average velocity @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests that the motion of driven rough interfaces in disordered media can be studied as a phase transition  which we shall call the _ depinning transition_. the velocity of the interface @xmath22 plays the role of the _ order parameter _ , since as @xmath23 , @xmath22 vanishes as @xmath24 we call @xmath25 the _ velocity _ exponent , and @xmath26 the _ reduced force _ ( fig .",
    "[ phases ] ) .    for @xmath23 ,",
    "large but finite regions of the interface are pinned by the disorder . at the transition ,",
    "the characteristic length @xmath27 of these pinned regions diverges as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the _ correlation length _ exponent .",
    "the added phenomenological richness introduced by the quenched disorder leads to an increased difficulty .",
    "in fact , the problem of identifying the universality classes for interface roughening in the presence of quenched disorder and determining the corresponding sets of critical exponents has so far remain unsolved .",
    "experimental and numerical measurements of some of the critical exponents vary considerably , and the question of the existence of universality classes bas been raised @xcite .",
    "the problem is made more complex by the disagreement of most experimentally measured values with analytical calculations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of why the same exponents vary in value for different systems .",
    "we study several numerical models introduced to study interface roughening in the presence of quenched disorder , and identify two universality classes .",
    "we show that one of those universality classes can be identified with the case studied analytically .",
    "the exponents for the other universality class can not be determined from renormalization groups calculations .",
    "however , mappings to directed percolation ( dp ) and isotropic percolation allow us to estimate most scaling exponents .    the identification of the universality classes and the calculation of the respective scaling exponents _ at _ the depinning transition enable us to understand the results for most of the models proposed and for some of the experiments .",
    "we shall see that several experimental results  particularly for the case of the moving interface in fluid - fluid displacement experiments  still do not fit the framework provided by the universality classes we discuss . for this reason , we study models in each of the universality classes _ above _ the depinning transition  i.e. , in the _ moving _ phase .",
    "the results obtained allow us to re - interpret the experimental measurements .",
    "furthermore , we find that for one of the universality classes , some of the critical exponents change values at the depinning transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the problem , by describing the set of relevant scaling properties and associated exponents , for driven interfaces moving in disordered media . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the experimental and numerical results motivated our study . in sec .",
    "iv we consider several numerical models , and identify two distinct universality classes . in sec .",
    "v we try to link the results obtained for the two universality classes with the experimental results . to achieve this goal , we study models , representative of each of the universality classes , above the depinning transition",
    ". finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our results and discuss some of the new questions arising from this work .",
    "an interface moving in a disordered medium becomes rough due to the action of the disorder .",
    "this roughening process can be quantified by studying the _ global _ interface width @xmath30 ^{1/2 } \\right \\rangle , \\label{wid}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the system size , the overbar denotes a spatial average , and the angular brackets denote an average over realizations of the disorder .",
    "the study of discrete models @xcite and continuum growth equations @xcite leads to the observation that during the initial period of the growth , i.e. for @xmath32 , the global width @xmath33 grows with time as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the _ growth _ exponent . for times much larger than @xmath36",
    "the width saturates to a constant value .",
    "it was observed that the saturation width of the interface @xmath37 scales with @xmath31 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the _ roughness _ exponent .",
    "the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath31 allows the combination of ( [ bet ] ) and ( [ wsat ] ) into a single scaling law @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 [ scl1 ]    here @xmath42 is the _ dynamical _ exponent , and @xmath43 is a universal scaling function that grows as @xmath44 when @xmath45 , and approaches a constant when @xmath46 .",
    "an alternative way of determining the scaling exponents is to study the _ local _ width @xmath47 in a box of length @xmath48 .",
    "the scaling law ( [ scl1 ] ) , and the fact that the interface is self - affine ( and with @xmath49 ) , allow us to conclude    @xmath50    where @xmath51 or @xmath52 [ scl2 ]    here @xmath43 is a universal scaling function that decreases as @xmath53 when @xmath46 and approaches a constant when @xmath45",
    ".    not all of the exponents introduced so far are independent ; e.g. , we can calculate the velocity exponent from the other scaling exponents , as we show by the following argument .",
    "near the depinning transition , except for a few growing regions , most of the interface is pinned by some pinning path .",
    "the growth occurs by the propagation of these growing regions through the system . the characteristic time required for this propagation must be of the order of @xmath36 , since this is the time for correlations to propagate across the entire system , as defined by ( [ scl1]b ) . during this process",
    "the interface advances from one blocking path to the next , the distance advanced is typically of the order of @xmath37 . since , close to the transition , @xmath54 , we can use ( [ corl ] ) , ( [ wsat ] ) , and ( [ scl1 ] ) to obtain @xmath55 upon comparison with ( [ vel ] ) , we conclude that @xmath56    this exponent `` scaling law '' can also be derived in a different way @xcite , by considering the interplay between the range of action of the quenched disorder and the length scales for which the disorder can be considered to be time - dependent because of the motion of the interface .",
    "the quenched disorder is a function of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but we can consider the change of variables to a reference frame moving with the velocity of the interface @xmath59 now , we can consider the conditions for which @xmath60 .",
    "this will happen for the length scale characterizing the action of the quenched disorder , @xmath27 .",
    "thus we have @xmath61 leading to ( [ thet ] ) .",
    "the most commonly measured exponent in experiments and simulations is the roughness exponent @xmath39 . in the last few years",
    ", several experiments in which quenched disorder plays a dominant role have been performed .    _",
    "( i ) _ stokes _ et al . _ performed fluid - fluid displacement experiments , and observed that for some conditions a self - affine interface would form , while for other , the growth would generate a percolation - like cluster @xcite .    _",

    "_ measured @xmath39 for fluid - fluid displacement experiments @xcite , consistently obtaining @xmath62 regardless of the velocity of the interface @xmath22 .",

    "( ii ) _ kessler _ et al . _",
    "integrated the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation with quenched disorder , with the purpose of explaining the results for the fluid - fluid displacement experiments @xcite .",
    "they reported values of @xmath39 that vary with the driving force , i.e. with the velocity of the interface . for low velocities they found @xmath73 , and for large velocities , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they found a decrease of the total width with the velocity of the interface .",
    "similar results were obtained earlier by koplik and levine @xcite .    _",
    "( iii ) _ buldyrev _ et al .",
    "_ introduced a discrete model to explain their imbibition experiments @xcite .",
    "they found that in @xmath71 dimensions the scaling behavior of the pinned interface can be obtained exactly by mapping the interface onto dp . in higher dimensions they found that the interface can be mapped onto a _ directed surface _ ( ds ) @xcite . in @xmath71 dimensions ,",

    "thus a change in the boundary conditions will not affect the growth process , and we can not expect any divergence of a possible nonlinear term when the magnetic field approaches its critical value . on the other hand , for large fields the effect of the quenched disorder diminishes , and we can observe an average interface orientation . for such values of field , we expect the presence of nonlinear terms , of _ kinematic _ origin , to be relevant .",
    "although for the sa regime the behavior of @xmath0 is similar ( fig .",
    "[ rfim2 ] ) , we do not have a simple argument that would explain the observed behavior .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that in the sa regime the rfim belongs to the universality class of eq .",

    "this conclusion is further supported by the agreement between the numerically determined exponents , @xmath157 and @xmath158 for @xmath65 dimensions , and the theoretical predictions of ( [ qew ] ) .",
    "the results of table [ tab1 ] show , for @xmath71 dimensions , a separation into two groups in the values of the critical exponents for the six models studied @xcite .",
    "this separation reflects the existence of two distinct universality classes , described by the two continuum growth equations , ( [ qew ] ) and ( [ qkpz ] ) . for the qew-1 , qew-2 models , and for the rfim in the sa regime ,",
    "we find that either @xmath1 or @xmath159 at the depinning transition ( fig .",

    "thus , the scaling behavior of these models should be correctly described by ( [ qew ] ) . for the dpd-1 , dpd-2 , and dpd-3 models",
    "we observe a divergent @xmath0 , indicating that nonlinearities are relevant near the depinning transition .",
    "thus to properly describe the scaling properties of these models it is necessary to study ( [ qkpz ] ) , since ( [ qew ] ) does not include the nonlinear term @xmath93 .",
    "further evidence of the existence of the two universality classes is given by the values of the roughness exponents .",
    "the models for which @xmath0 diverges at the depinning transition , have @xmath64 , in agreement with the mapping to dp @xcite . on the other hand , models in the universality class of eq .",
    "( [ qew ] ) , gave roughness exponents typically larger , and in better agreement with the theoretical prediction , @xmath73 .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss the implications of the previous results on other models and theoretical approaches studied in the literature .",
    "recently , considerable attention has been focused on a self - organized version of the dpd model , the so - called self - organized depinning ( sod ) model @xcite . in this model , the constant driving force of the dpd model is replaced by an algorithm that selects the site on the interface for which the disorder is weakest  i.e , it selects the point in the interface offering the least resistance .",
    "thus , the local update rule of the dpd model is replaced by a global search process , similar to the one used in invasion percolation .",
    "this update rule assures that the model will evolve to criticality and that it will remain in the critical state .",
    "this implies that the sod model is always at the depinning transition .",
    "thus the properties of the sod model are described by the dpd model at criticality , which implies , since the sod model is always at criticality , that the sod model can not be described by a continuum equation of the kpz - type , since this would require an infinite coefficient of the nonlinear term . however",
    ", this argument _ does not _ rules out that the sod model can be described by a continuum equation that upon a mapping to the quenched kpz equation will generate an effective coefficient @xmath0 that would diverge @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we identified the universality classes for interface roughening in the presence of quenched disorder . however , the experimental situation still leaves us with several unsolved puzzles , such as the change in the roughness exponent or the dependence of the global width on the driving force for the fluid - fluid displacement experiments .    in trying to shed some light over the remaining problems",
    ", we observe that most of the numerical and the analytical studies focus on the `` pinned phase '' ( @xmath160 ) while nearly all experimental results are for the `` moving phase '' ( @xmath20 ) .",

    "the effect of quenched disorder is no longer relevant , and even a week annealed disorder becomes important .",
    "the justification of this particular rule lies not only on the computational simplifications that it affords but also on the experimental finding that overhangs do not play an important role in the scaling properties of the interface for imbibition .    as was shown in refs .",

    "the deviation of the numerical values in the exponents for the dpd-2 model can be explained by the slow convergence of this model to the asymptotic scaling regime .",
    "the large error bars for all models arise from the fact that simulations were done for relatively small systems . despite the differences in the values of the scaling exponents , based on the numerical results combined with the exact results of refs .",

    "here we applied one of the methods suggested in @xcite , in which the unit time corresponds to flip all unstable interface spins .",
