    "factorization restores predictive power to calculations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which can not be carried out exactly due to the contributions of nonperturbative effects . by separating perturbatively - calculable and nonperturbative contributions to observables in qcd and relating the nonperturbative contributions to different observables to each other",
    ", we gain the ability to make real predictions .",
    "proving factorization rigorously is a technically challenging undertaking , which traditionally has been formulated in full qcd @xcite .",
    "more recently , many formal elements of these factorization proofs , such as power counting , gauge invariance , the organization of soft gluons into eikonal wilson lines , and their decoupling from collinear modes , have been organized in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "these generic properties of the effective theory allow one to write at least nominally a formula `` factorized '' into collinear ( jet ) and soft functions for an arbitrary hard scattering cross - section in which strongly - interacting light - like particles participate @xcite .",
    "examples are the factorization of a large class of two - jet event shape distributions in @xmath1 annihilations to light quark jets @xcite , jet mass distributions for @xmath0 to top quark jets @xcite , or arbitrary jet cross - sections in @xmath2 collisions independently of the choice of actual jet algorithm or observable @xcite .",
    "while the formalism of scet leads directly to expressing these observables as convolutions of separate hard , jet , and soft functions , blind use of this procedure without considering further specific properties of each chosen observable can hide whether factorization truly holds in a particular case or not .",
    "an ideal set of observables for which to examine factorizability is the set of angularities @xmath3 @xcite , which are two - jet @xmath1 event shapes dependent on a tunable parameter @xmath4 controlling how sensitive the event shape is to radiation along the jet axes or at wider angles . varying @xmath4 between 0 and 1 interpolates between the thrust @xcite and jet broadening @xcite event shapes , but @xmath4 can take any value @xmath5 and give an infrared - safe observable in qcd .",
    "angularities are known to be factorizable , however , only for @xmath6 @xcite . for events @xmath7 ,",
    "the angularity of a final state @xmath8 is @xmath9 where in the first form @xmath10 is the energy of particle @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the angle between its momentum and the thrust axis of @xmath8 . in the second form , @xmath13 is the momentum of particle @xmath11 transverse to the thrust axis , and @xmath14 is its rapidity with respect to the direction of the thrust axis .",
    "we assume all final - state particles are massless .    in a separate publication , using scet",
    ", we calculate the angularity jet and soft functions to next - to - leading order in the strong coupling @xmath15 , resum large logarithms using renormalization group evolution , and model the nonperturbative soft function in a way that avoids renormalon ambiguities @xcite .    in this letter , using angularity distributions as an example , we describe a simple , intuitive method for testing the validity of a factorization theorem deduced from the simple rules of scet .",
    "we begin by navely presuming the factorizability of a given observable and then attempt to calculate perturbatively the one - loop jet and soft functions . if the factorization holds , each of these functions should be infrared - safe . if they are not , we learn immediately that the factorization breaks down .",
    "perturbative infrared - safety of jet and soft functions is not , of course , by itself sufficient to guarantee validity of the proposed factorization theorem .",
    "the size of power corrections must also be taken into account .",
    "the methods we describe in this letter address only the former issue , not the latter .",
    "( power corrections for angularity distributions and their implications for factorizability were studied in @xcite . ) however , our method is a quick and direct way to narrow down the class of observables for which a `` generic '' factorization deduced from scet ( e.g. @xcite ) could actually be valid .",
    "our analysis also sheds light on some issues related to infrared divergences in effective theory loop integrals .",
    "finding a tractable regulator in scet that suitably controls all infrared divergences has been very challenging ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "care is also required to define the effective theory such that it avoids double - counting momentum regions and infrared divergences of full theory diagrams .",
    "the procedure of zero - bin subtraction has been proposed to eliminate such double - counting @xcite .",
    "we will address each of these issues without explicit calculation of the jet and soft loop integrals or use of an explicit infrared regulator .",
    "instead we just examine the regions of integration surviving in the sum over all relevant diagrams .",
    "we will work in pure dimensional regularization , and learn how to identify @xmath16 poles as infrared or ultraviolet in origin , clarifying the contribution made by scaleless integrals which are formally zero .",
    "we will thus conclude that the analysis is independent of the choice of any explicit ir regulator . in the process",
    ", we demonstrate the crucial role of zero - bin subtractions in obtaining physically - consistent , infrared - safe jet functions in angularity distributions for all @xmath6 .",
    "the ideas and methods illustrated through our discussion of angularity distributions are more generally applicable to other observables as well .",
    "the factorization theorem for the angularity distributions @xmath17 takes the form , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total @xmath20 born cross - section , @xmath21 is a hard function given in the effective theory by the square of a matching coefficient dependent only on short - distance effects , @xmath22 are jet functions dependent on the partonic branching and evolution of each of the two back - to - back final state jets , and @xmath23 is a soft function dependent on the low energy radiation from the jets and the color exchange between them .",
    "all the functions depend on the factorization scale @xmath24 , with this dependence cancelling in the full cross - section .",
    "the factorization theorem eq",
    ".   for angularity distributions has been proved in full qcd @xcite and in scet @xcite , for @xmath6 , where this condition was derived from the size of power corrections induced by replacing the thrust axis implicit in eq .   with the collinear jet axis",
    "@xmath25 @xcite . our attempt to calculate perturbatively the jet and soft functions in eq .",
    "will provide a complementary way to deduce this condition and an intuitive explanation of the absence of infrared divergences in the jet and soft functions for @xmath6 and their appearance for @xmath26 .",

    "the shapes of the regions in figs .",
    "[ softregionsa0 ] and [ softregions ] also tell us how using an explicit ir regulator would affect our analysis , and in fact teaches us that the choice of regulator must be made with care .",

    "this regulator successfully cuts off the divergences arising from the regions @xmath101 .",
    "however , using this regulator for @xmath92 , we find that the soft function still contains @xmath102 divergences and @xmath68 divergences even though the above analysis shows that @xmath88 is actually ir finite . from fig .",
    "[ softregions ] it is evident that a lower cutoff on @xmath76 also cuts off regions where @xmath103 , so it acts also partially as a uv cutoff .",
    "this underscores the challenge of defining consistent , explicit ir regulators in scet @xcite .",
    "we draw two lessons from the analysis thus far .",
    "the first is that in pure dimensional regularization , the coefficient of @xmath104 in a virtual diagram can not be determined from the virtual diagram alone , but only together with the real diagram whose ir divergence it is supposed to cancel ( cf .",
    "the reason that the virtual subtraction can depend on @xmath4 even though by itself it is independent of @xmath4 is that the area of overlap between the integration regions of real and virtual diagrams depends on @xmath4 .",
    "the second is that the presence or absence of ir divergences in the sum of all contributing loop integrals can ( and should ) be determined before completely evaluating the integral with a given ir regulator .",
    "looking at the shape of the region of integration in momentum space as above avoids confusion about the consistency of the regulator itself .",
    "now we analyze the jet functions eq .   at @xmath59 in perturbation theory .",
    "we will observe the same breakdown of infrared safety as @xmath105 due to the momentum regions beginning to include ir divergent regions .",
