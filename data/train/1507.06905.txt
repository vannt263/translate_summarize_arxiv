    "multiband superconductivity @xcite has been theoretically suggested few years later the bcs formulation of the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the superconductivity in mgb@xmath3 @xcite in 2001 and the observation of superconductivity in fe - based compounds ( febs ) @xcite in 2008 , renewed the interest towards multiband superconductivity .",
    "one main reason is the comprehension of the pairing symmetry in this class of superconductors which is still object of intensive investigation . in the case of mgb@xmath3",
    "there is a clear consensus towards the picture of two coexisting in - phase superconducting gaps ( @xmath1 pairing ) @xcite , while in febs the experimental evidences seem to be favorable , in some cases , to the @xmath4 pairing , implying that both the electron - like and the hole - like band develop an _ s_-wave superconducting state with order parameters of opposite sign @xcite .",
    "thus , in the @xmath4 symmetry , the superconducting gap exhibits a sign reversal between @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands which is absent in the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this phase difference can be probed using point contact andreev reflection spectroscopy ( pcars ) which is considered as one of the high - resolution phase - sensitive techniques to investigate the superconducting order parameter @xcite .",
    "this technique has recently been applied to gain insight on the properties of the febs @xcite . however , in contrast to the high-@xmath7 cuprate superconductivity manifesting a @xmath8-wave symmetry , phase sensitive experiments appear difficult in febs since the @xmath1 and @xmath4 pairings have the same crystallographic symmetry and , as a matter of fact , so far no experiment has been decisive in discriminating between the two symmetries .",
    "a complementary tool to gain information on the symmetry of the order parameter is the current - phase relation of the josephson current .",
    "in fact , along with pcars , the josephson effect has been used in the past as a probe of electronic properties in superconductors , included the order parameter symmetry ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper , in order to discriminate between different symmetries of the order parameter ( @xmath1 and @xmath4 ) , we develop a quantum waveguides approach for the josephson effect in a multiband superconducting junction .",
    "the presence of more than one band in the superconductor implies that extra scattering channels are present at the interface , a physical situation which is analogous to a quantum waveguides theory problem @xcite as recently suggested by pcars modeling of a normal - multiband superconductor junction @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the josephson current carried by andreev bound levels and demonstrate that several distinctive features of the @xmath4 and @xmath1 symmetries of the order parameter can be evidenced in the current - phase relation .",
    "the results are particular relevant with respect to the fast progresses in nanofabrication techniques @xcite which allow now to explore the josephson effect in the mesoscopic junction regime , where supercurrent flows through a small number of channels . in this kind of nanometric junctions",
    "the effect of a different symmetry , @xmath4 or @xmath1 , should emerge and the experimental results easily compared with the basic theory of the josephson effect in these materials .",

    "we present the quantum waveguide model of a multiband superconductor coupled to another identical multiband superconductor ( symmetrical junction ) and derive the spectral equation of the andreev bound states . in section [ sec : josephson ] we calculate the josephson current by using a field theory formalism in second quantization . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss the results for the current - phase relation and the temperature dependence of the critical current . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we draw the conclusions . details on the computation of the scattering coefficients are reported in appendix [ appendix : matrix ] .",

    "we specialize here to the case of an all - febs coplanar josephson junction , in which both the electrodes are febs materials ( symmetric junction ) , as occurs for instance in grain boundary junctions .",

    "since @xmath209 is not a maximal rank matrix , the normalization condition of the bound state wave function provides a further condition to determine the coefficients vector @xmath212 .",

    "this statement can be rigorously proved using the two - scale perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in particular the wave vector , @xmath240 , modulating the superconducting phase is much smaller than the fermi wave vectors @xmath241 and thus the phase modulation along the @xmath216-direction enters only parametrically in the one dimensional problem described in the main text .",
    "the validity of these arguments also requires that the cooper pairs tunneling with normal incidence represents the dominant microscopic process and thus the energy associated with transverse modes is negligible compared to the fermi energy .",
    "when the energy of the transverse modes becomes relevant ( e.g. for very short junctions with @xmath242 ) on the fermi energy scale , a full treatment of the transverse degrees of freedom is required .",
    "hereafter , we focus our attention on the case of adiabatic phase variation of @xmath243 along the transverse dimension of the junction . under this assumption ,",
    "once the current - phase relation @xmath244 has been obtained according to the procedure given in the main text , the magnetic field dependence of the critical current of the junction is obtained according to the formula : @xmath245}\\int_{-l/2}^{l/2}\\frac{d y}{l}i_{j}\\left(\\varphi-2\\pi \\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}}\\frac{y}{l}\\right),\\ ] ] where the current - phase relation presents a parametric dependence on @xmath216 .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : app - icvsfield2 ] ) provides the fraunhofer diffraction pattern , @xmath251 when a single - harmonic current - phase dependence @xmath252 is considered , while deviations are expected if the high - harmonic contribution is not negligible . for the above reasons , the magnetic diffraction pattern @xmath253 is an indirect probe of the harmonic content of the current - phase relation of the junction .",

    "<S> the temperature dependence of the josephson critical current is also analyzed and we find , for both the order parameter symmetries , remarkable violations of the ambegaokar - baratoff relation . </S>",
    "<S> the results are relevant in view of possible experiments aimed at investigating the order parameter symmetry of multiband superconductors using mesoscopic josephson junctions . </S>"
