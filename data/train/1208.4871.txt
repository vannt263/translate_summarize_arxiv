    "general relativity has held up well to various tests over the years from experiments and astronomical observations @xcite , and is considered a pillar of standard cosmology . however , it is interesting to consider modifications to the theory , particularly in light of the observed acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "one useful approach is to think of einstein gravity as an effective field theory , and consider higher order corrections to the einstein - hilbert action , either involving the metric alone or involving an additional posited scalar field . the goal then becomes to calculate the corrections to general relativity arising from these higher order terms , and using experiments to set bounds on the couplings parameterizing them .",
    "one such extension to general relativity is chern - simons gravity @xcite , where one assumes the existence of a scalar field @xmath1 coupled to gravity through a parity violating term .",
    "the theory is described by the action ) in which the scalar field is dynamical ; we will not consider the `` non - dynamical '' version of the theory in which the kinetic term for the scalar field is absent .",
    "we note however that our derivation of the action ( ) of the ghost graviton modes is valid for the non - dynamical theory , since the derivation does not involve any perturbations to the scalar field . ]",

    "@xmath7 is the square of the reduced planck mass , @xmath8 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath9 is the ricci scalar and @xmath10 a coupling constant with dimensions of inverse mass . here and throughout we use units with @xmath11 .",
    "also @xmath12 is an arbitrary potential and the pontryagin density is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the four dimensional levi - civita tensor . for purposes of the present discussion , we will assume that matter is minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "consider now the dynamics of chern - simons gravity in perturbation theory about a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological background . now in the limit @xmath15 constant , the chern - simons term ( [ eq : cs ] ) reduces to a surface term and we recover einstein s equations for the space - time dynamics .",
    "therefore , in the effective field theory that describes the perturbations , the operators that arise from the chern - simons term must be suppressed by a mass scale that is related to the derivative of the background scalar field .",
    "this mass scale is called the chern - simons mass @xmath16 , and is defined in the frw context by @xcite @xmath17 where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "general relativity is recovered in the limit @xmath18 for linearized tensor perturbations . because it is the chern - simons mass that enters into equations describing observables for linear perturbations , we choose to constrain it , rather than the more fundamental coupling @xmath10 that appears in the action ( [ eq : cs ] ) .",
    "also , since the background cosmological solution @xmath19 need not be a linear function of time , the chern - simons mass will in general be a function of time or of redshift ; we will focus in this paper on its value @xmath20 today .",
    "past work constraining chern - simons gravity has utilized solar system and binary pulsar tests of general relativity .",
    "measurement of lense - thirring precession by lageos give the bound @xcite @xmath21 a bound @xmath22 times stronger has been claimed from binary pulsar studies @xcite , but the validity of this result has been questioned @xcite , and a corrected bound is nonzero , since the derivation is based on the modified gravitational ampre equation which is valid in the dynamical theory @xcite . ] from binary pulsars is @xcite @xmath23    in this paper we study the vacuum stability of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solutions in chern - simons gravity as a function of the chern - simons mass parameter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ghosts ] we consider tensor perturbations to the frw metric .",
    "we show that for spatial momenta above the chern - simons mass scale , one of the two polarization modes is ghostlike and can decay to radiation .",
    "requiring that the radiation produced over the lifetime of the universe not exceed observational bounds allows us to constraint the parameters of the theory , which we do in sec .",
    "[ sec : vacuumdecay ] . finally in section",
    "[ sec : nonpert ] we argue that the theory does not exhibit classical runaway solutions , despite the existence of ghostlike modes , except possibly in the relativistic nonlinear regime .",
    "in chern - simons gravity , we assume that the background cosmological model is homogeneous and isotropic as in general relativity .",
    "the metric is of the form ds^2 = a()^2 [ - d^2 + _ ij d^i d^j ] , where @xmath24 is the scale factor , @xmath25 is conformal time , and @xmath26 are comoving coordinates , and the scalar field is @xmath27 . [ for simplicity we assume spatial flatness . ]",
    "the corresponding equations of motion do not contain any contribution from the chern - simons term , since the frw symmetries lead to a vanishing pontryagin density @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtain the usual friedmann equations with a scalar field 3 m_p^2 = _ m + + v ( ) , [ fr1 ] and ^ + 2 ^+ a^2 v ( ) = 0 , [ fr2 ] where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath28 is the matter density .",

    "we define the mass scale m _ * = m_p , and the canonically normalized graviton field modes ^can_a = m _ * h_a . the action ( [ eq : ghost ] )",

    "the hamiltonian of the theory may or may not be unbounded below ; addressing this question would require a nonlinear analysis beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". also it is not known at present whether the theory possesses a well posed initial value formulation : the sign flip at @xmath55 may be a hint that it does not .",
    "however , the ghost modes are a significant problem when quantum mechanical effects are taken into account , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "we now specialize to perturbation modes today which are deep inside the horizon , that is , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the hubble parameter .",
    "we also assume that @xmath58 . in this limit",
    ", we can neglect in the action ( [ eq : ghost1 ] ) the time dependence of the prefactor @xmath59 , and also the term proportional to the time derivative of @xmath60 .",
    "the result is just the standard action for graviton modes in minkowski spacetime , except for the sign flip for the ghost modes , but acquires correction factors of @xmath61 when written in terms of @xmath62 . ] .    because of this sign flip , decay of the vacuum of the theory",
    "is kinematically allowed .",
    "the vacuum decay rate per unit volume @xmath63 is naively infinite , because of the infinite phase space available for the decay products that arises from lorentz invariance dependence of the factor @xmath64 .",
    "however this violation does not affect the accessible volume of phase space . ] . rather than ruling out the theory outright because of the presence of ghost modes , we adopt the viewpoint that the action ( [ eq : ghost ] ) defines an effective quantum field theory as in refs.@xcite , with some effective cutoff @xmath0 on the physical wavenumber @xmath65 in cosmological rest frame .",
    "thus , our cutoff explicitly violates lorentz invariance ; such a violation is inevitable if one wants to obtain a finite vacuum decay rate .",
    "our viewpoint and treatment follow similar analyses of scalar ghost fields in cosmological models with equation of state parameter @xmath66 that satisfies @xmath67 @xcite . as in those analyses",
    ", we will find that stringent constraints on the parameters of the theory can be obtained by demanding that the total number of photons produced from vacuum decay over the lifetime of the universe not be in conflict with observations .",
    "our theory is now parameterized by two parameters , the cutoff @xmath0 and the chern - simons mass @xmath16 . now",
    "since the ghost modes arise only for momenta @xmath65 satisfying @xmath68 , there will be no ghost modes in the region @xmath69 of parameter space .",
    "therefore our arguments about vacuum decay do not constrain that region of parameter space ; we focus from now on on the complementary region @xmath70 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase space ] ) .",
    "we note that many papers on chern - simons gravity implicitly work in this regime @xmath70 , since they involve effects arising on scales @xmath71 , assumed to be within the domain of validity of the theory .",
    "we also note that the regime @xmath72 is disfavored by naturalness arguments , i.e. , it requires considerable fine tuning of the lagrangian ( see appendix [ sec : natural ] ) .",
    "if the vacuum perturbatively decays to stable particles , we can estimate the number of particles produced over the lifetime of the universe from such a process .",
    "given observational bounds on the energy density in this particle species , we can then constrain the decay rate .",
    "the strongest bounds will therefore come from production of particles whose energy density has been reliably measured , and which can be produced at a low order in perturbation theory .",
    "we argue that the photon is the best such candidate .",
    "we next make an order of magnitude estimate of the decay rate @xmath63 per unit volume to photons in the regime @xmath70 .",
    "the action for electromagnetism contains an interaction of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the 4-vector potential , @xmath75 is the metric perturbation , and @xmath76 is the canonically normalized version . because the graviton is ghostlike , the process @xmath77 is kinematically allowed , where @xmath8 is a left polarized graviton and @xmath78 is a photon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graviton ] ) .",
    "hence graviton ghosts can decay to photons at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "next , the coefficient @xmath79 in the interaction ( [ eq : interaction ] ) depends on the wavenumber @xmath80",
    ". however , for the purposes of our order of magnitude estimate , it will be sufficient to evaluate this coefficient at @xmath81 , since most of the decays will be at @xmath82 .",
    "therefore we can treat @xmath60 as a constant , m _ * ~m_p , where we have used @xmath70 and specialized to ghost modes .",
    "the decay rate @xmath63 per unit time per unit volume must be proportional to the square of the coefficient of the operator , so @xmath83 . the constant of proportionality in this relation must be some function of @xmath0 , and from dimensional analysis it now follows that , in which the volume of the region in phase space containing unstable modes shrinks to zero .",
    "the computation is valid to within a factor of order unity whenever @xmath84 . ]",
    "@xmath85    since @xmath63 has dimension ( mass)@xmath86 in units with @xmath87 .",
    "consider now the production of photons by this mechanism over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "we make the idealization that at any epoch , all the photons produced have an energy of exactly @xmath0 .",
    "then the evolution of the number @xmath88 of photons per unit logarithmic wavenumber @xmath80 per proper volume is given by ( a^3 n ) = ( k / a - ) , where @xmath89 is the scale factor with @xmath90 today .",
    "solving this equation gives for the spectrum today n(k ) = ( - k ) , [ gen ] where @xmath91 is the step function , @xmath92 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the values of @xmath89 and @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
    "the result ( [ gen ] ) is easy to understand : the factor of @xmath97 is the length of time during which photons of present - day energy @xmath98 are produced , and the factor of @xmath99 is the volume expansion factor since then . for a @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath100",
    "the spectrum becomes n(k ) = ( - k ) ^-1/2 .",
    "it follows that the energy density per unit logarithmic wavenumber @xmath101 is peaked at @xmath102 with a peak value of ~ ~. [ eee ]    finally , we note that the above derivation implicitly assumed that the chern - simons mass @xmath16 is constant . in reality",
    "@xmath16 is a function of redshift or of time , since the background cosmological solution @xmath19 is time dependent .",
    "however , our derivation shows most of the photons are produced at low redshift , @xmath103 .",
    "since the background cosmological solution evolves on the hubble timescale , the fractional change in the chern - simons mass out to redshifts of order unity is of order unity .",
    "therefore the result ( [ eee ] ) is still valid when taking the evolution of @xmath16 into account , up to a correction factor of order unity .",
    "we now compare the prediction ( [ eee ] ) with observational data , in two different ways .",
    "first , as long as @xmath104 , the energy density ( [ eee ] ) will contribute to the expansion of the universe . since observations of the expansion history",

    "ev , [ eq : photonconstraint1 ] where we have used @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "second , a more stringent constraint can be obtained by using direct observations of photons , albeit within a finite range of cutoffs @xmath0 .",

    "[ eq : photonconstraint ] figure [ fig : phase space ] shows the constraints ( [ fixed ] ) and ( [ eq : photonconstraint1 ] ) , ( [ eq : photonconstraint ] ) on the @xmath108 parameter space .",
    "it can be seen that the combined constraints rule out a large part of the region in parameter space with @xmath109 in which interesting chern - simons phenomenology occurs , except for the window @xmath110 .",
    "[ sec : pert ]     and the chern - simons mass @xmath111 , in ev .",

    "this is because for any value of @xmath16 , there exist modes with @xmath71 for which the chern - simons correction factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ghost ] ) is of order unity .",
    "even if @xmath112 is arbitrarily large , the high energy modes above this scale are unstable and the vacuum decays .",

    "however this bound applies only to the gravitons produced before recombination , whose energy density will be smaller than the estimate ( [ eq : gravitons ] ) by a factor of the ratio of the age of the universe at recombination to the age of the universe today .",
    "this factor is approximately @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the redshift of recombination .",
    "also for gravitons produced before recombination , the chern - simons mass @xmath117 in eq.([eq : gravitons ] ) should be replaced by @xmath118 , the value at recombination .",

    "the result ( [ eq : gravitonconstraint ] ) is slightly weaker than the constraint ( [ eq : photonconstraint ] ) from photons , and applies to a different version of the chern - simons mass .    finally , one might also be able to place additional constraints on the theory by considering the decay of the vacuum to two gravitons and one quanta of the scalar field , rather than to three gravitons .",
    "we next turn to a different question , the possible existence of classical runaway solutions that can occur in a theory whose hamiltonian is unbounded below .",
    "we will argue that such solutions do not arise in chern - simons gravity except possibly in the nonlinear relativistic regime @xmath120 where our analysis is invalid anyway .",
    "generically , a hamiltonian which is unbounded from below will only exhibit runaway solutions in the regime where the interaction terms in the lagrangian are comparable to the negative kinetic energy terms @xcite .",
    "we use this criterion to estimate the required occupation number of a ghost graviton mode for such a runaway behavior to develop in our system .",
    "no runaway solutions will plague the effective field theory ( [ eq : ghost ] ) because the ghost and non - ghost fields are decoupled to linear order",
    ". however , interaction terms will appear if we expand the action ( [ first ] ) to higher than quadratic order .",

    "we conclude the ghost modes generated by perturbations to frw do not exhibit runaway solutions within the domain of validity of our analysis .",
    "we have shown that if the effective field theory cutoff @xmath0 is above the chern - simons mass scale @xmath16 , and if the chern - simons mass is not infinite ( the generic case ) , then the vacuum of chern - simons gravity is unstable and can decay to photons .",
    "our estimate of the photon production rate was used to set constraints on the parameter space .",
    "one might imagine improving this bound by being less cavalier in the estimation of the decay rate and number density .",
    "however , because the production rate goes like a high power of the cutoff scale , orders of magnitude difference in the number density yield very modest improvements in final constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "whether the full nonlinear theory has a hamiltonian which is unbounded below is an interesting open question .",
    "we also note that it is possible that the decay of the vacuum could be a lot faster than indicated by our perturbative calculations , if it is mediated by a non - perturbative process .",
    "one might imagine a tunneling process similar to the decay of false vacua in scalar field theories via bubble nucleation .",
    "in particular , a homogeneous unstable region with small chern - simons might be expected to produce a stable endstate consisting of a homogeneous region with a chern - simons mass larger than the cutoff .",
    "however any such transition could not proceed via a spherically symmetric process , since the chern - simons term does not contribute to the dynamics in spherical symmetry .",

    "<S> the decay rate can be made finite only if one interprets the theory as an effective quantum field theory valid up to some momentum cutoff @xmath0 , which violates lorentz invariance . by demanding that the energy density in photons created by vacuum decay over the lifetime of the universe not violate observational bounds , we derive strong constraints on the two dimensional parameter space of the theory , consisting of the cutoff @xmath0 and the chern - simons mass . </S>"
