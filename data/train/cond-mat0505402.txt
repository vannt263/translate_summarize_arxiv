    "<S> the correlation functions of an ionic fluid with charge and size asymmetry are studied within the framework of the random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for the charge - charge correlation function demonstrate that the second - moment stillinger - lovett ( sl ) rule is satisfied away from the gas - liquid critical point ( cp ) but not , in general , at the cp . </S>",
    "<S> however in the special case of a model without size assymetry the sl rules are satisfied even at the cp . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for the density - density and charge - density correlation functions valid far and close to the cp are obtained explicitely .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> much attention has been focused on an issue of the criticality and phase transitions in ionic fluids . for reviews of the experimental and theoretical situation , </S>",
    "<S> see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite- @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most widely used theoretical models of coulomb systems is the so - called `` restricted primitive model '' ( rpm ) , in which the ionic fluid is modelled as an electroneutral binary mixture of charged hard spheres of equal diameter immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum . </S>",
    "<S> early studies @xcite established that the model has a gas - liquid critical point ( cp ) , the location of which was determined by recent simulations @xcite-@xcite . due to the controversial experimental findings </S>",
    "<S> , the critical behavior of the rpm has also been under active debates and strong evidence for an ising universal class has been found by computer simulation @xcite as well as by a recent theoretical study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the effects of size- and/or charge - asymmetry on the phase diagram have been studied theoretically @xcite-@xcite and by simulation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the more relevant issue concerns the behaviour of the two - body charge - charge correlation function @xmath0 near the cp where the density fluctuations diverge strongly . </S>",
    "<S> recently aqua and fisher @xcite using a class of exactly soluble spherical models studied both symmetric and nonsymmetric version of @xmath1 ionic models . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that in the former case the two - point charge correlations remain of short range and obey the stillinger - lovett ( sl ) rule near and at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise they found the divergence of the charge correlation length to be precisely the same as the divergence of the density correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> they also found that the sl rule fails at criticality .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we address an issue of the behavior of the correlation functions of an ionic fluid far and near the cp . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we consider a charge- and size - asymmetric continuous model of an ionic fluid . according to @xcite the fourier transform of the charge - charge correlation function of the model @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> can be presented as @xmath3 where the first vanishing term results from electroneutrality ( zeroth - moment sl condition ) while the second term yields the second - moment sl rule with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the debye length ) . </S>",
    "<S> we intend to answer the question whether the sl rules are satisfied in the cases of both non - symmetrical and symmetrical ionic fluids .    in order to fix our notations </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case of a fluid made of two species @xmath6 . in the grand - canonical ( gc ) ensemble an equilibrium state is characterized by the inverse temperature @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively ) and two dimensionless local chemical potentials @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ordinary chemical potential and @xmath12 is some external field acting on particles . recall that the gc partition function @xmath13 $ ] is a log - convex functional of the @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the truncated two - body correlation functions are defined as @xmath15 ( 1,2)= \\frac{\\delta^{2 } \\ln \\xi\\left[\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2 } \\right ] } { \\delta \\nu_{\\alpha}(1 ) \\delta \\nu_{\\beta}(2 ) } \\ ; .\\ ] ] the legendre transform of @xmath16 defined as @xmath17 = \\sup_{\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2 } } \\left\\lbrace \\sum_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle \\rho_{\\alpha}\\vert \\nu_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle -   \\ln \\xi\\left[\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2 } \\right]\\right\\rbrace \\ ; , \\ ] ] gives us the free energy . in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we now consider the case of ionic mixtures , particles of species @xmath28 are supposed to bear a charge @xmath29 and those of species @xmath30 bear an opposite charge @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obviously convenient to introduce the total number and charge densities , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , by the relations @xmath35 with @xmath36 for a homogeneous fluid we certainly have the charge neutrality condition @xmath37 where the hat denotes the microscopic charge density and the brackets @xmath38 denote a gc average . </S>",
    "<S> the ( truncated ) correlations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from equations given above that we can introduce two symmetric matrices of correlation functions , namely @xmath41 which are related by the matricial equations @xmath42 similarly we introduce the @xmath26 and the @xmath43 as @xmath44 in such a way that the form of oz equation is preserved , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the unit matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the behavior of @xmath47 in the critical region at large @xmath48 or equivalently at small @xmath49 in fourier space </S>",
    "<S> . this study will be made in the framework of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) defined by the closure relation @xmath50 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rpa ] ) @xmath51 is the matrix of the direct correlation functions of some reference system chosen here to be a hard sphere fluid ( hs ) mixture ( with diameters @xmath52 , @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath53 is built from short range pair interactions and , finally , @xmath54 denotes the matrix of coulomb interactions . with these notations , </S>",
    "<S> the oz equation  ( [ oz ] ) can be rewritten in fourier space as @xmath55 where @xmath56 \\\\ \\widetilde{\\phi}_{nq}(k)&=&\\frac{1}{(1+z)^{2}}\\left [ \\widetilde{\\phi}_{11}(k ) -2\\widetilde{\\phi}_{12}(k ) +   \\widetilde{\\phi}_{22}(k)\\right ] \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\widetilde{\\phi}_{qq}(k)&=&\\frac{1}{(1+z)^{2}}\\left [ z \\widetilde{\\phi}_{11}(k ) + ( 1-z)\\widetilde{\\phi}_{12}(k ) -   \\widetilde{\\phi}_{22}(k)\\right ] \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the tildes mean a fourier transform </S>",
    "<S> .    a general study of the limit @xmath57 of eq .  ( [ rpa ] ) would be tedious and we make the following simplifying assumptions :    * the hs will all be of the same diameter @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> * we split the potential @xmath59 into two parts , i.e. @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the repulsive part and @xmath62 denotes the attractive one . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive part @xmath63 is necessary to induce a liquid - vapor transition in the rpa approximation . since we have considered hs of equal diameters the repulsive potentials @xmath64 are used to mimic the soft core asymmetric repulsive interactions </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at small @xmath49 , we assume that @xmath65 which implies that @xmath66 where @xmath67 are complicated functions of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 which will not be displayed here . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath69 can be interpreted as the effective diameters for the ions .    as a consequence of these assumptions </S>",
    "<S> we have a simple result @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fourier transform of the truncated two - body correlation function of a one - component hs fluid at the density @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we are now in position to study eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ toto ] ) in the limit @xmath75 .    at @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> one finds that @xmath77 or @xmath78 where @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 is regular and there is no critical point ( cp ) in this case . if @xmath82 , the isotherm compressibility @xmath83 can diverge signaling the occurrence of a cp . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out @xcite that @xmath84 is a positive convex function of the density with a single minimum at @xmath85 with a value @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from this remark that , in the rpa approximation , the critical density is @xmath87 and that the critical temperature is given by @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , along the critical isochore and above @xmath89 , @xmath81 behaves as @xmath90 yielding the critical exponent of compressibility @xmath91 as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> following aqua and fisher @xcite we can cast the expressions for @xmath92 and @xmath2 as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the eigenvalues of the matrix of the direct correlation functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 it is easily shown that at small @xmath49 @xmath98 with @xmath99 in the above eq . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath100 is the ordinary direct correlation function connected to @xmath51 by @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , along the critical isochore above @xmath89 we have @xmath102 where the squared density - density correlation length is given by @xmath103 the positivity of @xmath104 , i.e. the positivity of @xmath105 , implies some restrictions on the various parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the critical exponent of the correlation length is @xmath106 and the fisher exponent @xmath107 . in the case where @xmath108 and @xmath109 one recovers for @xmath105 the result of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally the behavior of @xmath94 for @xmath57 is found to be @xmath110 where we have defined an effective squared debye number as @xmath111 @xmath112 being the usual squared debye number . </S>",
    "<S> hence , once again along the critical isochore we get for @xmath2 the expression , @xmath113 which is valid far and at the cp at small @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> some comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , away from the cp ( @xmath114 ) we have @xmath115 which means that the both sl rules are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite for the case when the direct correlation function is given by ( [ rpa ] ) . in the general case , at the cp ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 </S>",
    "<S> and we have for @xmath2 @xmath118 as is seen from the above equation @xmath119 and thus the first sl rule is satisfied at the cp . by contrast , @xmath120 is proportional to @xmath121 but with the coefficient that is not correct to ensure screening . hence , the second sl rule is violated at the cp .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in the special case of a symmetric model such that @xmath122 and thus @xmath123 we have the simple result @xmath124 and , in this case , the second sl rule is satisfied even at the cp </S>",
    "<S> .    our last comment will be for the charge - density correlation function , which along the critical isochore above @xmath89 behaves as @xmath125 at small @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the asymmetric model @xmath126 away from the cp when @xmath127 and @xmath128 at the cp . note that for the symmetric model @xmath129 .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have studied density - density , charge - charge and charge - density correlation functions for the charge- and size - asymmetric model far and at the gas - liquid cp within the framework of the rpa and have shown that in a general case the second - moment sl rule is satisfied away from cp and is not satisfied at the cp . in the particular case of the symmetrical model </S>",
    "<S> the both sl rules are satisfied at the cp . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that a more comprehensive study of the criticality in ionic fluids requires the fluctuations to be taken into consideration at the level higher than the rpa . </S>",
    "<S> this issue as well as a detailed analysis of an effect of the charge- and size - asymmetry on the phase behaviour will be presented elsewhere . </S>"
