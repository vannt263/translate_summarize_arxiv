    "quantum optomechanics is the study of phenomena originating from the mutual interaction between electromagnetic radiation and mechanical motion @xcite . in cavity optomechanics both the electromagnetic field and the mechanical vibrations are effectively restricted to single modes , and the strong coupling among phonons and photons achievable there enabled the demonstration of various quantum mechanical effects during the last years @xcite . in the domain of optical frequencies strongest optomechanical coupling has been obtained in optomechanical crystals @xcite where nanostructuring of dielectric materials is exploited to generate phonon and photon modes with strong spatial localization in order to enhance the light - matter interactions .",
    "very recently , experimental progress with nanophotonic waveguides supporting long - lived , high - frequency phonon modes evidenced that quantum optomechanical effects may become accessible also within a multi - mode version of optomechanics involving continua of propagating phonon and photon modes @xcite . at the classical level ,",
    "the brillouin physics of interacting photons and phonons in waveguides has been studied extensively and led to the demonstration of a wide scope of nonlinear optical phenomena , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "so far , the dominant mechanism for optomechanical coupling in waveguides has been electrostriction , that is the modulation of the index of refraction of the bulk dielectric material associated with its acoustic vibrations causing scattering of photons on these periodic index modulations .",
    "the recent experiments with nanophotonic waveguides entered a new regime where radiation pressure effects due to vibrational surface deformations start to dominate over electrostriction which may result in vastly enhanced photon - phonon coupling . at the same time",
    ", these devices can maintain large quality factors for ghz mechanical modes extending over long cm - scale nanowires providing large optomechanical interactions over significant time and length scales .",
    "overall , these developments indicate brillouin quantum optomechanics as a promising route towards integrable , broad - band platforms supporting strongly interacting fields of phonons and photons .    on the theoretical side , the description of brillouin optomechanics in classical terms is well established @xcite .",
    "a corresponding quantum mechanical description of electrostrictive coupling in terms of a multi - mode hamiltonian has recently been derived by agrawal et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of multimode phonon cooling . in cavity quantum optomechanics involving single phonon and photon modes",
    "both effects are commonly taken into account @xcite based on a formula by johnson et al .",

    "sipe et al .",
    "@xcite very recently provided a hamiltonian treatment of stimulated brillouin scattering in nanoscale integrated waveguides accounting for electrostriction and radiation pressure , following the method of @xcite .    in the present work we aim to contribute to this development of a quantum theory of brillouin optomechanics in two respects : firstly",
    ", we derive the multi - mode hamiltonian for brillouin optomechanics by applying perturbation theory directly to the field hamiltonian for the case of an isotropic dielectric material which includes on equal footing electrostriction and radiation pressure mechanisms .",
    "our derivation reproduces the results of sipe et al .",
    "@xcite but avoids the rather technical smoothing procedures introduced by johnson et al .",
    "@xcite , employed also in @xcite , in order to deal with discontinuities at surfaces .",
    "we believe that the point of view advocated in the present derivation provides valuable physical insight to an otherwise rather unintuitive result .",
    "secondly , we apply the general formula of the multi - mode hamiltonian for brillouin optomechanics to the important special case of a cylindrical nanowaveguide , and evaluate analytically the parameters in the hamiltonian characterizing the phonon - photon coupling strength .",
    "we use our analytical expressions to demonstrate the domination of radiation pressure effect over electrostriction for nanoscale waveguides , and determine optimal parameter regimes exhibiting maximal coupling .",
    "the formalism is applicable to systems of any dimensional scales , ranging from cavity optomechanical systems involving localized photon and phonon modes up to bulk materials in which photons and phonons are described by continuous fields as in brillouin optomechanics .",
    "we treat a cylindrical nanoscale waveguide ( tapered fiber ) , which exhibits a ( quasi)continuum of modes propagating in the longitudinal direction with localized discrete modes due transverse confinement .",
    "we consider in much detail the case of a nanofiber made of silicon material that is embedded in free space .",
    "we analytically solve for the photon and phonon vector mode functions and dispersion relations and calculate the photon - phonon coupling parameters originating from electrostriction and radiation pressure mechanisms .",
    "this case is motivated by the recent progress in brillouin optomechanics @xcite , but also by the work on tapered optical nanofibers that have been used in manipulating , trapping , and detecting neutral cold and ultracold atoms @xcite , in which optically active mechanical modes of tapered nanofibers have been also investigated @xcite .",
    "moreover , we provide a means to compare the theoretically calculated photon - phonon coupling parameter with the experimentally observed gain parameter . moving to the real - space representation of the hamiltonian",
    ", we solve the system of equations for the stokes stimulated brillouin scattering .",
    "the stokes field is amplified with a gain parameter that is related to the photon - phonon coupling parameter in the derived hamiltonian , similar to what has been discussed by van laer et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : perturbationtheory ] contains the derivation of the classical , perturbed hamiltonians for the coupled light and mechanical excitations through radiation pressure and electrostriction mechanisms .",
    "the discussion is followed by the canonical quantization of the coupled classical fields , where the interacting multi - mode photon and phonon hamiltonian is derived .",
    "the photon - phonon coupling parameters are explicitly calculated for the case of cylindrical nanowires in section [ sec : nanonwire ] .",
    "a relation between the photon - phonon coupling parameter and the gain parameter of stokes stimulated brillouin scattering is presented in section [ sec : gain ] , and the coupled photon - phonon real - space hamiltonian is introduced .",
    "the appendices include the full solutions of the electromagnetic fields and the mechanical excitations in a cylindrical dielectric waveguide .",
    "we aim first to derive the classical hamiltonian that represents the mutual influence of the mechanical excitations and the electromagnetic field in a bounded dielectric medium , and which are characterized by the electric field @xmath0 and the mechanical displacement field @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the electromagnetic field in a dielectric , lossless , and nonmagnetic medium with a scalar permittivity @xmath2 is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath3 where the electric displacement field is defined by @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian coupling of photons and phonons follows from evaluating the correction @xmath5 to @xmath6 due to a mechanical displacement @xmath1 causing a perturbation @xmath7 in the permittivity @xmath2 .",
    "we will consider corrections in first order of the mechanical displacement throughout the paper , and limit the discussion to isotropic fluctuations in the dielectric constant .",
    "the explicit dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath1 differs for radiation pressure and electrostrictive interaction , and will be detailed below .",
    "nevertheless , both effects are covered by the perturbation to the field hamiltonian in eq .",
    "@xmath8 here @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ deltaemh ] ) denotes the perturbation of the inverse of the permittivity which is not to be confused with the inverse of the perturbation @xmath10^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the contributions to @xmath5 due to the corrections in the amplitude of the electric displacement field @xmath11 are negligibly small , on the order of the ratio of phonon to photon frequency , as shown in appendix  [ sec : maxwell ] .",
    "a further correction of the same order is introduced through magnetic polarization effects @xcite .",
    "note that the perturbation of the field hamiltonian  ( [ emh ] ) needs to be done in the representation where the energy density is expressed in terms of the electric displacement field .",
    "if instead the electric field @xmath12 is used , the contributions due to corrections of the field amplitude will be significant , cf .",
    "appendix  [ sec : maxwell ] , and @xmath5 would take a much more cumbersome form .",
    "we consider a dielectric material with permittivity @xmath13 in a volume @xmath14 , that is localized in a surrounding medium with permittivity @xmath15 occupying the complementary volume @xmath16 . for a dielectric material in vacuum @xmath17 .",
    "the unperturbed permittivity can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a step function defined by @xmath20 a mechanical displacement @xmath1 of the dielectric medium in @xmath14 will affect the material s permittivity in two ways : in the electrostrictive mechanism , the fluctuations change the magnitude of the permittivity of the material in @xmath14 at a fixed boundary .",
    "radiation pressure in turn corresponds to fluctuations in the material boundary at a fixed magnitude of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the perturbed permittivity can be written as @xmath22\\theta({\\bf x+{\\bf q}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .",
    "the first order corrections is @xmath24 and the contributions from radiation pressure and electrostriction are , respectively , @xmath25 the contributions of these two perturbations to the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "will be treated in the following two subsections .",
    "we note first that @xmath26 in eq .",
    "denotes a delta distribution whose effect is to turn volume integrals into surface integrals over the boundary @xmath27 between @xmath14 and @xmath16 , that is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the infinitesimal surface element .",
    "thus , when using eq .   in it will be vital to take care that the remaining integrand does not contain discontinuities on the boundary surface rendering the integral undefined .",
    "this concerns in particular the discontinuity in the field component of @xmath30 parallel to the boundary surface . in order to overcome this difficulty we consider an ( arbitrarily thin ) shell volume @xmath31 enclosing the boundary surface @xmath27 , and rewrite the contribution to the interaction hamiltonian within @xmath32 in terms of the fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 parallel and orthogonal to the surface that are both continuous , @xmath35 here we used @xmath36 . in restricting the integration to the shell volume @xmath32 we anticipate , in view of eq .",
    ", that it is the energy within this subvolume which will be relevant for the perturbation due to radiation pressure .",
    "the remaining hurdle is to arrive at a well behaved perturbation of the inverse permittivity in eq .",
    "this can be achieved by expressing the inverse as @xmath37 which yields @xmath38 for the contribution due to radiation pressure .",
    "finally , we can use eqs .",
    ", , and in expression to arrive at the hamiltonian describing radiation pressure interaction @xmath39 we used the symbols @xmath40 and @xmath41 following the notation introduced by johnson et al . in @xcite .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "is over the surface @xmath27 of the dielectric medium , and all fields are evaluated on that surface .",
    "thanks to the continuity of @xmath42 and @xmath43 there is no ambiguity in evaluating the field on either side of the surface .",
    "the result presented here agrees with the one derived in @xcite for the perturbed eigenfrequency of photonic field modes .",
    "johnson et al . used a smoothing procedure in order to deal with the difficulty of discontinuities of field amplitudes at the surface .",
    "the alternative approach presented here avoids such technicalities and at the same time provides directly the interaction hamiltonian covering both frequency shifts of photon modes and brillouin scattering among different field modes .",
    "it is this last aspect which is of main interest in the description of the optomechanics of extended nanophotonic waveguides .",
    "furthermore , the interaction hamiltonian is directly amenable to quantization , as will be done in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantization ] , and provides firm grounds for the description of radiation pressure effects in brillouin quantum optomechanics .",
    "electrostriction appears due to the tendency of a dielectric material to be compressed in the presence of light , and as a consequence to excite mechanical vibrations in the medium @xcite .",
    "the appearance of mechanical vibrations modulate the optical properties and result in small changes in the dielectric constant that induce scattering of the light .",
    "a hamiltonian description of electrostriction has been derived previously by agrawal et al .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    "we present a derivation within the present approach , starting from expression   for the perturbation of the bulk value of the permittivity due to a mechanical displacement .    by means of the electrostriction",
    "constant @xmath44 the change in the permittivity can be related to fluctuations of the mass density @xmath45 @xmath46 which in turn is determined through the mechanical displacement @xmath47 overall , we arrive from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaepsel ] ) at @xmath48 electrostriction mechanism in nanoscale structures can give rise to anisotropic phenomena .",
    "anisotropic contributions induced by longitudinal phonons in nanoscale waveguides are immaterial @xcite .",
    "as we concentrate mainly in processes involving longitudinal phonons we treat here only the isotropic case of scalar fluctuations @xcite .",
    "anisotropic phenomena induced by tensor fluctuations of the dielectric function are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : deltaepsel ] ) can be used directly in eq .",
    "( [ deltaemh ] ) when resorting to the representation of @xmath5 in terms of the electric field ( using again @xmath49 ) @xmath50 no issues regarding discontinuities in the integrand arise here since the domain of integration is effectively limited to the volume @xmath14 occupied by the dielectric due to the step function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaepsel ] ) .",
    "here @xmath51 decreases by increasing @xmath52 as expected .",
