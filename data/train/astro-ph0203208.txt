    "in a supernova ( sn ) explosion , the shock wave must ultimately emerge from the body of the star , and begin to propagate down the exponential density gradient of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "in newtonian fluid dynamics , the propagation of such a shock is described by a self  similar solution ( raizer 1964 ; grover and hardy 1966 ; hayes 1968 ) . this self ",
    "similar solution is unavoidable ( raizer 1964 ) .",
    "in fact , it turns out that , as the shock accelerates , a sonic point is formed , separating matter located immediately behind the shock from the flow s initial conditions ; this prevents pressure waves ( _ i.e. _ , causal information ) to reach post  shock material from the the area where the flow s initial conditions are set .",
    "thus all flows will converge to the same solution , irrespective of their initial conditions .",
    "the lack of dependence upon initial conditions severely constrains the ensuing flow , by restricting the number of parameters upon which the shock evolution may depend ; in fact , this constraint is so strong that only a single ( self  similar ) solution exists .    in the newtonian solution",
    ", it is found that the shock velocity increases exponentially , in such a way that the shock reaches spatial infinity in a finite time .",
    "this is clearly impossible when account is taken of special relativity , and therefore the newtonian solution must break down at high shock velocities , as expected .",
    "the question of precisely how the shock evolves in relativistic conditions has not been investigated so far .",
    "this problem has acquired a new urgency within the hypernova model ( paczyski 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) for gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "in fact , meszaros and rees ( 2001 ) have shown that , despite the large assumed energy release of the central engine , the outwardly moving shock in the large star hypothesized to give rise to the grb can only reach a lorentz factor of @xmath0 at the end of the h  envelope , and they had to invoke ( without explicit computations ) shock acceleration down the star exponential atmosphere to reach the required lorentz factors of @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of a self - similar temporal structure in grbs is also suggested by an analysis of their power spectra ( beloborodov , stern , & svensson 2000 ; see also sivron 1998 ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to derive a fully ( special ) relativistic self  similar solution for the problem of shock propagation in an exponential atmosphere ( section 2 ) , and to discuss its use in the hypernova model for grbs ( section 3 ) .",
    "we shall assume that a cold ( @xmath2 ) material is stratified with density distribution @xmath3 ; the shock is supposed to move toward @xmath4 , thus with positive velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the symmetry is assumed to be planar , since both the length scale of stellar atmospheres and the total extension of the atmosphere are much smaller than the stellar radius . in the newtonian analog ,",
    "the shock speed is set by a purely dimensional argument ( e.g. chevalier 1990 ) : @xmath6 , with @xmath7 an adimensional constant to be determined . in the special relativistic problem ,",
    "dimensional arguments alone fail because the presence of the light speed @xmath8 allows the construction of a new adimensional quantity ( @xmath9 ) , thusly spoiling the above argument .",
    "we can however recover from this impasse by appealing to both dimensional and covariance arguments .",
    "the time  like part of the shock four  speed @xmath10 is of course determined by the identity @xmath11 , while the space  like part must be built in covariant fashion from the available quantities . defining a four vector @xmath12 , we can then write for the spatial part of @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "this is the only sensible solution to our dimensional / covariant problem .",
    "we see from this that , as long as we use proper time , the structure of the problem is identical to that of the newtonian analog .",
    "in particular , the shock reaches spatial infinity within a finite proper time .",
    "we may choose @xmath16 for the moment when this occurs , so that the flow is restricted to @xmath17 .",
    "incidentally , note that this implies @xmath18 .",
    "physically , this makes perfect sense : as the shock accelerates , its proper time is contracted by its lorentz factor ( @xmath19 ) with respect to the fluid time .",
    "the shock speed in terms of the fluid time can be obtained by remembering that @xmath20 , and substituing in the above equation one finds ( @xmath21 from now on ) @xmath22 taking the time derivative of both sides we obtain @xmath23 which can be immediately integrated to yield @xmath24 the low speed limit @xmath25 is @xmath26 , in agreement with the newtonian solution .",
    "the hyperrelativistic limit ( @xmath27 ) is @xmath28 where we have introduced an initial shock lorentz factor @xmath29 at time @xmath30 , for ease of use in the future .",
    "since the shock moves essentially at speed @xmath31 , we can rewrite the lhs of the above equation as @xmath32 , from which we see that the initial and the final ( i.e. , when the shock leaves the exponential atmosphere ) shock lorentz factors are related by @xmath33    the above clearly shows that all we have left to do is to determine the value of the parameter @xmath7 . to this purpose",
    ", we must consider the fluid equations for the post  shock material , which we have found it convenient to take in the form given by blandford and mckee ( 1976 , their eqs .",
    "14 - 15 ) @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the convective derivative , and we have dropped curvature terms ( which are contained in the blandford and mckee equations ) , to keep with our planar symmetry approach . here",
    "@xmath38 is the local energy density , @xmath39 is the local fluid lorentz factor , as seen from the reference frame of the unshocked material ( to be distinguished from @xmath19 , the shock lorentz factor in the same reference frame ) , and @xmath40 is the baryon number density always in the reference frame of the unshocked fluid .",
    "the above equations assume an hyperrelativistic equation of state for the post  shock material of the form @xmath41 , which is correct in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , for the large shock lorentz factors appropriate to this problem ( @xmath43 ) heavens & drury ( 1988 ; see also iwamoto 1989 ) showed that the adiabatic index of the flow is within @xmath44 of its asymptotic relativistic value of @xmath45 , irrespective of the upstream temperature and plasma composition ( see especially their fig.2 , and eqs .",
    "25 - 26 ) .",
    "it should be remarked here that eq .",
    "( [ important ] ) remains valid whatever we assume for the equation of state , but the precise value of @xmath7 depends instead on the particular choice of the equation of state .",
    "the boundary conditions for this problem are provided by taub s jump conditions ( taub 1948 ) , which again we take in the hyperrelativistic limit given by blandford and mckee ( 1976 ) : @xmath46    here the subscripts @xmath47 refer to pre and post shock quantities , respectively ; @xmath40 and @xmath39 are always defined in the unshocked fluid frame , and @xmath38 in the comoving frame .",
    "the enthalpy of the unshocked material , @xmath48 , equals @xmath49 since this material is assumed to be cold . in our problem , @xmath49 is not a constant , because the atmosphere is stratified .",
    "we have @xmath50 so that , ultimately , @xmath51 which is the form we shall use in the following .",
    "an identical argument shows that @xmath52 where @xmath53 .    in order to search for a self  similar solution",
    ", we need to assume a form for the similarity variable . in the newtonian analog , this is clearly @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the instantaneous shock location . in this problem",
    ", we take @xmath56 the rationale for this is that , since post  shock material has a lorentz factor which is @xmath57 times smaller than the shock s , the post  shock material falls behind the shock by an amount @xmath58 as the shock covers an exponential length .",
    "please notice that , with our notation , @xmath59 for the shocked material .",
    "the post  shock quantities @xmath60 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 can then be taken of the form @xmath61 with boundary conditions given by eqs .",
    "( [ taub ] ) ( the second one ) , ( [ taube ] ) , ( [ taubn ] ) as @xmath62    substitution of eqs . ( [ scalingvariable ] ) , ( [ scaledquantities ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ bmck1 ] ) , ( [ bmck2 ] ) and ( [ bmck3 ] ) yields , after some algebra ( the dot indicates derivation with respect to @xmath63 ) @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 from these , we see what fixes @xmath7 : the denominator of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ grand1 ] ) goes to zero at a critical point @xmath67 and , unless the numerator simultaneously does the same ( which will only occur for a special value of @xmath7 ) , a non ",
    "integrable singularity will ensue .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in the newtonian analog , where it has been shown that this critical point is a sonic point .",
    "it is exactly because there is a sonic point that a self  similar solution can develop : in fact , material between the shock and the sonic point is not in causal contact with post  sonic point material , and thus its properties can not be determined by the problem s initial conditions .    to keep the problem non  singular ,",
    "we impose that the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ grand1 ] ) vanish simultaneously , obtaining @xmath68 from the numerator , and @xmath69 for the denominator .",
    "the conditions above lead to two solutions for @xmath7 , one positive and another negative .",
    "the positive solution must be discarded because otherwise the shock would not reach spatial infinity for @xmath70 ( eq . [ propertime ] ) .",
    "we are therefore left with only one sensible solution , @xmath71 the location of the sonic point , @xmath67 , where both the numerator and the denominator vanish , is determined through numerical integration of eqs .",
    "( [ grand1 ] ) , ( [ grand2 ] ) and ( [ grand3 ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath72 .",
    "also note that @xmath73 , and therefore the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ grand3 ] ) is always well - behaved . the full numerical solution for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ important ] ) that the necessary asymptotic lorentz factor required for a proper modelling of the properties of grbs , i.e. @xmath77 ( remember that the lorentz factor of the matter is only @xmath78 that of the shock ) can be reached by crossing a modest factor of @xmath79 density decrease in the exponential atmosphere ( assuming @xmath80 ) .",
    "yet , the total energy of material moving at these large lorentz factors is only modest .",
    "in fact , let us compute the distribution of kinetic energy with baryon number .",
    "consider a cylindrical fluid element with surface area @xmath81 ( with the normal along the direction of fluid motion @xmath82 ) , and length @xmath83 along the direction @xmath82 .",
    "this element will have a bulk kinetic energy of @xmath84 .",
    "what we want to know is the energy distribution at the moment in which the shock gets out of the exponential atmosphere .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath85 the shock lorentz factor at that moment .",
    "then @xmath86 which can be coupled to the solution @xmath87 to yield a parametric representation of @xmath88 , the distribution of kinetic energy with respect to the final lorentz factor . the adimensional part of the function in the previous equation is plotted in fig .",
    "the numerical factor can be estimated using eq .",
    "( [ important ] ) : @xmath89 in this expression , the values for @xmath90 ( the edge of the h ",
    "shell ) , @xmath91 ( the matter density at the end of the h  shell , and thus presumably at the beginning of the exponential atmosphere ) , and @xmath29 ( the shock lorentz factor at the end of the h  shell @xmath92 beginning of the exponential atmosphere ) are taken from meszaros and rees ( 2001 ) .",
    "taking the adimensional factor from fig.2 , we see that the kinetic energy falls short of the average isotropic burst energy ( schmidt 1999 ) by about three orders of magnitude ( note that here what we are computing is the isotropic energy ) .    before showing how to come out of this impasse ,",
    "we need to consider which part of fig .",
    "2 can actually be obtained in a realistic model .",
    "the reason for this limitation comes from the fact that the idealized model presented here has been propagating down an exponential atmosphere forever , while in a realistic model only a finite amount of matter can have converged onto this self  similar solution , given the finite dimension of the star . for this reason ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "2 three ticks , which correspond to the present position of matter which was located , before being reached by the shock , at @xmath93 exponential scale ",
    "lengths from the shock s present location .",
    "if we think that the initial atmosphere extends for @xmath93 exponential scale  lengths , then we can believe the part of fig . 2 located to the right of their respective tickmarks .",
    "leftward of them , the true , physical solution will depart from the one shown here , and the total kinetic energy at the corresponding values of lorentz factor will be much smaller than the values plotted ( obviously , since the physical solution has finite mass and energy , which is not true for the idealized one ) .",
    "let us now suppose that the putative burst progenitor possesses a wide exponential atmosphere , spanning some @xmath94 orders of magnitude in density .",
    "then , for an initial lorentz factor @xmath95 , the shock lorentz factor at the end of the atmosphere is @xmath96 ( eq . [ important ] ) ; once again , the overall energy of matter moving at this speed would be modest ( @xmath97 erg ) , but fig .",
    "2 shows that most of the energy ( before the cutoff implied by the finite extent of the atmosphere ) will come out at a lorentz factor @xmath98 of the shock s factor , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath99 . with the values",
    "above , the total energy then amounts to @xmath100 erg , in reasonable agreement with schmidt s ( 1999 ) isotropic estimates . it should be noticed that inspection of the numerical solution for large values of the distance parameter @xmath63 shows the material to be cold ( @xmath101 ) , so that there will be negligible further acceleration of these slower shells by @xmath102 work , and @xmath103 remains a good estimate of the coasting lorentz factor .    to summarize",
    ", the application of our solution to shock acceleration in the atmosphere of a massive star has shown that , in atmospheres with small density range , the amount of energy carried by material accelerated to the typical grb lorentz factors falls short of the grb required energetics . however , for stars with a wide density range in their atmospheres ( @xmath104 orders of magnitude ) , a sufficient quantity of energy is carried by later shells of material moving at the typical grb lorentz factors . in this model , the early emission would be dominated by an ultra  hard component , due to the very large@xmath19 shells slowing down in the ism .",
    "this is at least qualitatively consistent with virtually all bursts studied in some detail by bepposax ( frontera _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 , see especially their fig .",
    "2 ) , which exhibit , in their first few seconds only , spectra peaking beyond the instrument s ( grbm ) observing limit of @xmath105 kev .",
