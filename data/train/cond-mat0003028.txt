    "spin systems consisting of chain- or ladderlike structures as basic building blocks have recently attracted much attention .",
    "these systems are of interest on the one hand as one - dimensional ( 1d ) model systems allowing to study quantum phase transitions related to the existence of a spin gap and their dependence on the exchange parameters @xcite ; on the other hand they describe an increasing number of real materials when an additional ( small ) exchange coupling in the remaining two dimensions is introduced @xcite .",
    "a material of particular recent experimental interest is @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have performed an investigation of the dynamics of such systems with a twofold aim : ( i ) we discuss the spectrum @xmath2 of the low - lying triplet excitations in the ideal 1d system over a wide range of exchange parameters using both series expansions and exact diagonalization , in order to determine the range of applicability of the series expansion approach and to study the validity of using an effective interaction between dimers . we find and discuss in particular a regime in phase space with extremely small dispersion and a minimum of @xmath2 at finite wavevector @xmath3 .",
    "( ii ) we extend the dimer expansion to include 3d couplings and apply this method in particular to a discussion of the dynamics of the quasi zigzag - ladder material kcucl@xmath4 in terms of microscopic exchange parameters .    of particular interest as an 1d building block for this type of materials is the @xmath5 zig - zag chain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : leitmod ] and defined by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath6    on the theoretical side , this generic 1d model interpolates between a number of seemingly different limiting cases : it is an alternative way to formulate the hamiltonian for the generalized @xmath5 spin ladder generalized to include one diagonal interaction or equivalently the @xmath5 chain with nearest neighbour ( nn ) alternating exchange and next nearest neighbour exchange ( we use the shorthand nnna - chain in the following ) . it thus covers the well - known limiting models of the isotropic @xmath5 heisenberg chain ( haf , @xmath7 ) , the standard antiferromagnetic @xmath5 ladder ( @xmath8 ) , the weakly interacting dimer chain ( @xmath9 ) and the @xmath10 antiferromagnetic ( haldane ) chain ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "it can alternatively be considered as a two legged spin ladder with rung coupling @xmath12 , leg coupling @xmath13 and additional diagonal coupling @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical interest in the dynamics of the nnna - chain goes back to the work of shastry and sutherland @xcite , who identified the elementary excitations without alternation as free particles ( spinons ) , which may become bound . a variational approach to the excitations of the nnna - chain based on this concept @xcite",
    "has recently been shown to cover qualitatively the transition from free spinons to the haldane triplet .    in a first approximation real materials",
    "are often considered as examples of 1d chains with a hamiltonian as given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ; then they realize different points in the phase diagram spanned by the interaction constants @xmath15 and illustrate the interest to describe systematically the variation of static and dynamic properties with the parameters @xmath15 .",
    "static properties , such as susceptibility and specific heat , however , have turned out to be rather insensitive to the details of the microscopic hamiltonian @xcite and , in the case of @xmath16 @xcite have even not been able to reveal the basic interactions as two- instead of one - dimensional .",
    "thus for a description of real materials a systematic microscopic treatment of the dynamics is of particular importance . in section",
    "ii we present a systematic overview of the dynamics of the 1d system , discussing both general properties as well as comparing results from exact diagonalization to results from series expansions . in section",
    "iii we use the series expansion approach to calculate the low - lying excitations in a 3d material with the structure of @xmath1 in terms of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "this will allow us to go beyond the determination of effective dimer exchange parameters in recent work @xcite and to determine the microscopic exchange parameters .",
    "a summary will be given in the concluding section iv .",
    "we start with a short summary of the symmetries of the 1d system ( the chain direction is denoted as @xmath17axis ) : translational symmetry is described by the wavevector @xmath18 defined in a brillouin zone @xmath19 ; the unit cell of length @xmath20 contains two spins , or equivalently one dimer ( one singlet in the limit @xmath21 ) .",
    "we thus use the conventional notation for ladders : @xmath20 is the distance between rungs , whereas the distance between spins in the nnna - chain picture is @xmath22 .",
    "we thus expect two basic excitations per unit cell .",
    "we will use units @xmath23 in the following .",
    "excitation frequencies at wavevectors @xmath18 and @xmath24 are equal owing to reflection symmetry along the chain",
    ".    for special points in the phase diagram additional symmetries exist :    without alternation ( @xmath25 ) it is natural to use a unit cell of length @xmath26 containing only one spin .",
    "our brillouin zone is half of this brillouin zone of the uniform chain and the excitations of the conventional spin chain will appear folded back to our smaller brillouin zone .    for the ladder symmetry ( @xmath27 )",
    "there exists a quantum number parity , @xmath28 , resulting from the interchange of the two legs and we can classify states as positive or negative under this reflection .",
    "each dimer in the singlet ( triplet ) state contributes a factor of @xmath29 to this parity .",
    "an alternative notation introduces the component @xmath30 with values 0 ( corresponding to @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) .",
    "the ground state is a singlet in the whole phase plane and the lowest excited state is generally a triplet .",
    "the ground states for the ladder symmetry ( @xmath34 ) have parity @xmath35 for @xmath36 even .",
    "we have studied the dispersion @xmath2 of the basic triplet excitation for a typical variety of paths in the @xmath37 parameter space by two methods : ( i ) by exact numerical diagonalization , using the lanczos algorithm , we have calculated @xmath2 for the lowest excited states ( between 2 and 4 states ) for 24 spins , i.e. for 7 different values of wavevector @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) we have performed series expansions around the dimer point , @xmath38 , up to third order analytically and up to 10th order after implementation of the cluster algorithm @xcite on an alpha work station .",
    "thus we have obtained the ground state energy @xmath39 and an effective hamiltonian which can be diagonalized by a fourier transformation .",
    "finally we get the dispersion relation for the lowest excited state expressed as series @xmath40 .    in the follwoing we present a number of results for the 1d zig - zag chain which prepare the stage for",
    "the first application of the method to a nontrivial 3d system in section iii and also add some new aspects to the large number of previous studies on the 1d system defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) in recent years . to give a short review of existing work",
    "we mention first that the dimer series expansion approach started when the work of brooks harris @xcite was revived by uhrig @xcite in the context of @xmath41 .",
    "the expansion for the triplet dispersion was extended to high orders recently by oitmaa et al @xcite for ladders to @xmath42 order , by barnes et al @xcite for the heisenberg alternating chain to @xmath43 order and by singh et al @xcite for the disorder line to @xmath44 order ( using a special symmetry on this line ) .",
    "the model of eq .",
    "( 1 ) was also treated by alternative methods as random phase approximation @xcite , brckner theory for the equivalent dilute bose gas @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , and continued fraction expansion based on ed results @xcite and dmrg @xcite . from these studies a rather complete picture of the low - energy dynamics of the 1d zigzag chain has emerged . in this section",
    "we supplement this picture by the following two remarks .",
    "we start from the neighbourhood of the dimer point where an expansion in @xmath15 to low orders is sufficient .",
    "up to third order the following result for the dispersion is obtained ( as given in ref .  , frequency and exchange constants are measured in units of the intradimer exchange @xmath12 from now on ) :",

    "( 2 ) also shows the general feature that the location of the minimum of the dispersion curve shifts from @xmath47 to @xmath48 somewhere close to crossing this line .    in recent approximate theoretical treatments of interacting dimer systems @xcite",
    "the exchange interactions between individual were reduced to an effective interaction between dimers . for the present 1d zigzag chain the result of this approximation is that only the combination @xmath49 enters into the dispersion . in more detail ,",
    "the result is    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the dispersion in lowest order , i.e. the result of simple propagation of an excited dimer triplet without considering its coupling to higher energy modes .",
    "evidently this is true in lowest order of the expansion ; it is seen , however , already from eq .",
    "( 2 ) that additional terms which depend on the individual exchange interactions enter in higher order . comparing the higher order coefficients in the series expansion",
    "we find that the effective dimer approximation of eq .",
    "( 3 ) amounts to keeping only the leading ( i.e. lowest ) powers in @xmath15 for each coefficient @xmath52 of @xmath53 .    for a quantitative check of the effective dimer approximation",
    "we refer first to ref . where the dispersion on the disorder line , i.e. for fixed @xmath54 is shown .",
    "the effective dimer approximation is reasonable for a large part of the line but deteriorates rapidly when the non - alternating limit @xmath55 , i.e. the majumdar - ghosh point is approached . for the more generic value @xmath56",
    "we show the dispersion in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5mi ] ; it is seen that the effective dimer approximation is of very limited value in this case .",
    "in addition these results , comparing the series expansion results to spectra from exact diagonalization , we find the following limits of validity for the dimer series expansion method : whereas the @xmath57 order spectra coincide with exact diagonalization results within a few percent for @xmath58 and @xmath59 the accuracy deteriorates rapidly when the symmetric ladder ladder configuration ( @xmath60 ) is approached .    whereas the dispersion is flat on the disorder line to first order in @xmath15 , but develops maxima and minima in higher orders with an apparent jump of the minimum energy form @xmath61 to @xmath62 close to this line ,",
    "it was noted already before @xcite from exact diagonalization results that a regime with extremely flat dispersion and a minimum at finite wavevector @xmath3 might exist in a narrow regime in @xmath37 parameter space .",
    "we have investigated this point again using the series expansions to @xmath63 order which provide us with a continuous wavevector dependence and have confirmed the earlier speculation : in fig .  [ fig:6a ] , [ fig:6 ]",
    "we show two examples for spectra on the lines @xmath64 resp .",

    "[ fig:6a ] demonstrates that the shallow minimum of the dispersion curve at a wavevector in the middle of the brillouin zone is reproduced in the series expansions . as further example",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] the flat dispersion for somewhat smaller values of @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : minicomp ] we show the development of the wavevector @xmath66 for the minimum value of @xmath67 on the line @xmath65 in the @xmath37 parameter space ( corresponding to the case of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the gradual transition of @xmath66 between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , possibly with infinite slope at the end points , is clearly seen .",
    "the comparison between results in @xmath42 and @xmath57 order illustrate the convergence of the expansion . at present , however , the series expansions do not give a hint to a possible fundamental reason for nearly flat dispersion : we have examined the expansion coefficients @xmath52 of @xmath53 up to @xmath57 order , but we do not find any indication of a convergence to zero for @xmath70 .",
    "in real materials consisting of weakly interacting chains such as @xmath71 @xcite and @xmath72 @xcite it is clear from inelastic neutron scattering experiments that there is considerable dispersion for wavevectors perpendicular to the double chain direction . for weakly interacting chains ,",
    "the series expansion approach is to be considered as the only reliable systematic approach which ( by comparing results in subsequent orders ) allows a consistency check .",
    "whereas the series expansions have been extended to cover systems coupled in 2d and interesting results have been obtained for the spin peierls material @xmath72 @xcite , for the 1/5 depleted square material @xmath73 @xcite as well as for general parameters @xcite , we present in the following the first results using the expansion for weakly interacting dimers for a 3d coupled system with particular application to investigate the magnon dispersion in the material @xmath71 .",
    "the zig - zag chain system @xmath71 actually appears to be closer to the dimer point than the systems treated so far and therefore is supposed to be a better candidate for this expansion .",
    "the structure of @xmath71 is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] in a projection to what is conventionally called the @xmath74plane : the fundamental dimers which are shown as solid lines form zig - zag chains in the @xmath17direction , neighbouring zig - zag chains are shifted with respect to each other in @xmath75direction by half a lattice constant @xmath76 ; this shift as well as the tilting of the internal dimer direction are indicated in fig .",

    "the main intradimer exchange is denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "the exchange interaction per bond between spins in dimers separated by a lattice vector @xmath85 is denoted as @xmath86 for the exchange between equivalent spins ( pairs ( 11 ) or ( 22 ) ) of the corresponding dimers and as @xmath87 for the exchange between nonequivalent spins ( pairs ( 12 ) or ( 21 ) ) .",
    "the following exchange interactions will be considered : @xmath88 for pairs ( 11 ) and ( 22 ) , @xmath89 for the pair ( 12 ) and @xmath90 for the pair ( 12 ) , and for the two cases @xmath91 and @xmath92 : @xmath93 for the pair ( 11 ) starting from dimer @xmath78 and for the pair ( 22 ) starting form dimer @xmath80 , @xmath94 for the pair ( 22 ) starting from dimer @xmath78 and for the pair ( 11 ) starting from dimer @xmath80 , @xmath95 for pairs ( 12 ) starting from either dimer @xmath78 or dimer @xmath80 .",

    "as already seen in the 1d case of section 2 , a correct treatment beyond first order involves @xmath12 and @xmath100 independently .",
    "according to previous work @xcite the main exchange interactions in addition to the basic intradimer exchange are between dimers separated by @xmath105 . except for @xmath106",
    "these dimer - dimer interactions involve both @xmath12 and @xmath100 and it is our aim in the following to discuss the validity of the effective dimer approximation for @xmath1 and to investigate to what extent the exchange interactions between individual spins can be determined from the present status of experimental results .",

    "so far only the basic triplet with @xmath121 has been observed and the interchange of minima with variation of @xmath115 is an effect of the crystallographic lattice geometry and not of the 1d ladder geometry .",
    "excitations with @xmath122 are excitations with two dimer quanta and have a minimum energy of twice the gap energy @xmath123 .    in order to obtain results which are quantitatively reliable",
    "we have performed series expansions for the 3d coupled system to @xmath124 order following the lines described in section ii . because of the complex lattice we did not characterize the clusters which results in a large number of clusters : 5532 clusters in 4th order .",
    "the convergence of these series expansion results is excellent for the small values of the expansion parameters @xmath125 in the application to @xmath1 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig9mi ] and  [ fig10mi ] we show results for dispersions along typical lines in @xmath126space together with the data points from ref .  .",

    "[ eq : gl5 ] as discussed above .",
    "we assume that the effective dimer exchange takes the values determined in previous work @xcite and have therefore fixed the following combinations of exchange parameters :    @xmath129    the interactions @xmath130 are found to be negligibly small . in order to demonstrate the relevance of the individual spin exchange parameters ( as opposed to the effective description ) we discuss the separations @xmath131 and @xmath132 independently : in fig .",
    "[ fig9mi ] we present the variation of the dispersions @xmath133 in selected directions in @xmath134 space for different values of the coupling @xmath135 with the remaining parameters fixed as given above .",
    "it is seen that the distribution of the effective dimer interaction between parallel and diagonal terms essentially shifts the dispersion curve by constant amounts .",
    "a comparison to the corresponding neutron scattering results leads to the conclusion that @xmath136 is the most likely value .",

    "the results for the interchain interactions in ( @xmath145 ) direction are much less conclusive .",

    "the series up to @xmath57 order in the 1d case and up to @xmath124 order in the 3d case were evaluated explicitly after implementation on a work station . in the 1d case",
    "the dispersion curves agree with those obtained from exact diagonalization using the lanczos algorithm for a large regime around the dimer point ; in this regime the method provides a reliable approach to calculate the dispersion in its continuous dependence on the wavevector . in a narrow regime close to the shastry - sutherland line",
    "we find the minimum of the dispersion curve at an intermediate wavevector @xmath148 . as an application of the 3d case we present the application of the method to the @xmath149structure .",
    "fitting to the dispersion as measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite we determine the exchange interchange interactions between individual spins in addition to the effective interaction between dimers determined before .",
    "it is shown that the effective dimer approximation , when treated in the random phase approximation , sums up the leading powers of the dimer expansion .",
