    "the two point correlation function @xmath7 as observed in redshift space ( i.e.  where the radial dimension is not true separation but distance as measured through redshift , involving both separation and radial velocity ) involves two distinct effects from redshift space distortions ( rsd ) @xcite . in the linear regime",
    ", the density fluctuations and peculiar velocities are coherently evolved through the continuity equation .",
    "thus the known correlation function in real space from the linear perturbation theory developed by gravitational instability is uniquely transformed into @xmath15 in redshift space .",
    "gravitational infall squeezes the clustering pattern in redshift space along the line of sight ( i.e.  the @xmath9-direction ) , enhancing the correlation function by the kaiser factor @xcite . in the non  linear regime",
    ", however , the observed correlation function appears elongated along the line of sight due to the random virial velocities of galaxies , called the finger of god effect ( fog ) @xcite . because the fog effect smears into even large scales , the linear theory kaiser effect is not appropriate along the @xmath9 direction  @xcite .",
    "a more accurate description of these rsd effects is required for boss clustering data .",
    "improved models were tested using simulations in  @xcite , and applied to dr9 data in  @xcite .",
    "these corrections are briefly reviewed below .",
    "the mapping between real space and redshift space has significant correlations between the density and velocity fields .",
    "although it extends into a infinite series of polynomials , a few leading modes are dominant near the linear regime . while the original linear theory includes terms up to @xmath16 , terms up to @xmath17 are necessary in the improved models ; higher order terms can be safely ignored in the quasi - linear regime  @xcite .",
    "the cross  correlation spectrum between density @xmath18 and velocity @xmath19 is not independently measured , but rather estimated from the measured auto  correlations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , based upon the assumption of a perfect cross ",
    "correlation coefficient ( which is valid only in the linear theory ) .",
    "the deviation of spectra from the linear theory is perturbatively calculated using the resummed perturbation theory called regpt  @xcite . when restricting analysis to the quasi - linear regime , the result is the non  linear portions of the power spectra are better separated from the linear spectra ; for the latter the assumption of perfect cross  correlation between density and velocity fields can be applied",
    ".    however , the fog effect remains non  perturbative in this model .",
    "the non  linear smearing effect is dominant at first order , and can be parameterised by a velocity dispersion @xmath20 .",
    "our theoretical models ( as all others ) are broken at scales in which higher order terms become important , however .",
    "this motivates us to introduce the cut  off scales and consider them carefully .",
    "we use two cut  offs : @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ". the @xmath21 accounts for the limit of theoretical description of regpt , and the @xmath22 reflects the unknown contamination of the residual fog effect .      the observed clustering as a function of the transverse and radial distances is related to the density and velocity growth functions , and the fog parameter @xmath20 .",
    "cosmological information is extracted from the density and velocity functions .    from the clustering @xmath15 , measured in comoving distances , the transverse and radial distances scale linearly with @xmath1 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the evolution of clustering occurs coherently for all scales in linear theory , and its initial shape ( scale dependence ) is determined in the early universe . using early universe information from the cosmic microwave background",
    "we denote this as a planck ( or wmap9 ) prior . all evolution in the amplitude after the last scattering epoch informs us about late time cosmology .",
    "we denote the normalized density and coherent motion ( velocity ) growth functions as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this is a model independent analysis in the sense that we do not require , or use , any specific assumptions on energy density components such as dark energy or curvature ; indeed we do not even have to assume the friedmann - robertson - walker relation of @xmath1 as an integral of @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the galaxy bias and in linear theory @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the growth factor .",
    "similarly @xmath30 is growth rate , and is proportional to the sometimes used combination @xmath31  @xcite , with @xmath32 where 0 denotes the present . see @xcite for more details .",
    "the spectra of the density and the velocity fields are naturally expected to receive nonlinear corrections .",
    "one of these corrections comes from the random motion of galaxies , which results in the damping effect of the power spectrum amplitude .",
    "we apply a gaussian fog function with free parameter @xmath20 characterizing the velocity .",
    "however , as these non  perturbative damping effects are not fully understood , we employ a cut - off scale to remove small scales where this is exacerbated , and study the effects of varying that scale .    in order to check the validity of our overall approach , we test it against simulations .",
    "we use the mock galaxy catalogs created by  @xcite , which are designed to investigate the various systematics in the galaxy sample from data release 11 ( dr11 ) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) @xcite , referred to as the  cmass \" galaxy sample . in constructing the mock galaxy catalogs ,",

    ". a first consistency check of @xmath1 and @xmath23 with the planck lcdm model can be ascertained by comparing the two 2d bao rings in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_combined ] .",
    "the thick dashed and solid circles represent the rings estimated from the planck lcdm model and the dr11 measurements .",
    "the growth functions do not alter the 2d bao ring , and it is distorted differently by @xmath1 and @xmath23 in the transverse and radial directions .",
    "the consistency between the solid and dashed circles means that the measured distances agree well with the planck lcdm model .",
    "we quantify this in table  [ tab : measured ] , where the measured @xmath1 and @xmath23 are within the 68% confidence limit of the planck lcdm prediction .",
    "we discuss the effect of @xmath39 below , and of north vs south maps in the next section .    for the density and velocity growth factors the information comes from multiple scales , and especially from the redshift space anisotropy . while the signal  to  noise of the inner ( higher amplitude ) contours of clustering is higher , the use of regpt to second order is insufficient for accurate modelling of @xmath15 at scales @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , the cross  spectrum between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is not perfectly cross  correlated .",
    "when the cut  off @xmath40 is applied , the constraints on @xmath24 and @xmath25 from their distinctive amplification of the inner contours  @xcite become weaker , but more robust as we now see .    at small scales ,",
    "if the non  perturbative effect of fog is underestimated , then the residual squeezing can be misinterpreted as a smaller @xmath2 .",
    "we expect the fog effect to be increasingly important at smaller scales , and so these run increasing risk of misestimation . to test this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : measured_combined ] we show the cosmology results as we vary @xmath22 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the strongest effect is on @xmath2 , and indeed inclusion of small scales noticeably lowers the measured @xmath25 .",
    "however , for all @xmath43 the results have converged and the measured values are insensitive to the exact value of @xmath39 .",
    "this indicates that the approximation for treating fog should not be trusted for @xmath44 , while above this scale our approach is robust .",
    "this argument holds as well for @xmath1 and @xmath23 , though less extremely .",
    "considerable caution should be applied to the use of the clustering data on small scales .",
    "+    the outer contours provide another indicative behavior for @xmath2 . when @xmath25 varies , the location of peaks on 2d bao circle moves differently from the variation of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the peak points run away from the pivot point ( roughly where @xmath45 ) as @xmath25 decreases , and move toward it for increasing @xmath25 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_combined ] we see that around the bao ring the fourth and sixth contours recede away from the planck lcdm prediction , while the fifth contour , which lies close to the pivot point , has not moved .",
    "this implies the measured @xmath25 is smaller than the planck lcdm prediction and indeed we find @xmath46 in comparison with 0.46 predicted by planck lcdm prediction .",
    "this is still within 68% cl however ( note though that using a lower @xmath39 moves @xmath2 to even smaller values ) .    the quantity @xmath24 represents the combination of density field and linear bias .",
    "as no cosmological model is assumed , the two are not separable .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : measured ] , @xmath24 is measured to be @xmath47 .",
    "if the planck lcdm model is true , then the linear bias at @xmath3 can be estimated to be @xmath48 with 7% fractional error ( recall that @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is consistent with what we observe from the simulation .",
    "the velocity dispersion parameter @xmath20 for fog is measured to be @xmath50 .",
    "the fog effect is at first order degenerate with @xmath25 ; this causes weak constraints on both @xmath20 and @xmath25 .",
    "our model independent analysis allows several consistency tests .    1 .   in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology ,",
    "@xmath1 is formed from an integral over @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   within general relativity and frw , the growth rate @xmath2 and",
    "expansion rate @xmath23 are tied together .",
    "3 .   neutrino mass suppresses growth , so a measured consistency with planck lcdm ( i.e.  minimal neutrino mass ) disfavors higher neutrino mass ( or requires a conspiracy with enhanced growth from modified gravity  but this would show up in the previous consistency test ) .",
    "we therefore study the joint probability distribution between the measured cosmological quantities , e.g.  the two dimensional likelihood contours of @xmath2 vs @xmath23 .",
    "all such contours are marginalized over the remaining quantities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dparam ] we present two dimensional cosmological parameter contours in four different combinations .",
    "the x s represent the best values of planck lcdm models ; we see that our model independent analysis agrees within the 68% confidence level with the cosmology that assumed lcdm , general relativity , and minimal neutrino mass .",
    "this holds for all the measured distances and growth functions .",
    "the first panel provides evidence for the frw consistency relation of the background quantities of the distance and expansion rate .",
    "the second panel involves measurements of the perturbed quantities , from the density and velocity fields .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath24 is consistent with expectations for galaxy bias .",
    "the measured @xmath25 can be converted to @xmath51 , with the planck lcdm model predicting @xmath52 , again within 68% cl .",
    "( note this would not hold if we naively included smaller scales where nonlinear modelling is not robust . )",
    "the third and fourth panels , showing that the joint likelihoods for the background and growth quantities are consistent with planck lcdm , can be thought of as a ( weak , model independent ) test of the general relativity criterion .",
    "that the fourth panel , showing the @xmath2@xmath23 likelihood , is consistent with planck lcdm ( with minimal neutrino mass ) , also disfavors a larger neutrino mass and its accompanying suppression of growth .",
    "if one assumed that the background cosmology is truly the planck lcdm model , then the growth measurement could be converted to an estimate of the gravitational growth index @xmath53 @xcite or a sum of neutrino masses @xmath54 .",
    "however for both of these the uncertainty on @xmath2 is multiplied by a large prefactor so the constraints are weak .",
    "another interesting check involves a comparison of the estimated cosmological quantities using only the northern or southern hemisphere sky .",
    "the median ra and dec of each patch is @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : map ] ) , so the centers of these two disjoint sky patches are separated by 145 degrees on the sky .",
    "the effective volume of the north is 4.5 gpc@xmath57 and that of the south is 1.5 gpc@xmath57 .",
    "table  [ tab : measured ] breaks down the cosmological results by hemisphere .",
    "all quantities are consistent within 68% cl ; nevertheless , there are some interesting patterns worthwhile keeping an eye on as the data improves and the error bars shrink .    in the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : errors_cns ] we present the measured @xmath1 and @xmath23 for north and south separately , and the full survey combination . north and south agree with each other and with planck lcdm predictions .",
    "the detailed numbers are shown in table  [ tab : measured ] .",
    "note that the median measured @xmath23 from the combined map does not lie between the north and south measured values ; this occurs due to the non - gaussian probability distribution for the measured @xmath23 in the south  the mode value is 2116 @xmath58mpc . for the measured coherent motion @xmath2 in the bottom panel ,",
    "the north is somewhat inconsistent ( @xmath59 ) with the planck lcdm prediction . from table  [",
    "tab : measured ] , in the north @xmath60 and in the south @xmath61 , while the lcdm fiducial has @xmath62 .",
    "the central values of north and south are noticeably different , though due to the large uncertainty from the small effective volume in the south this can not be said to be statistically significant",
    ".    one might speculate about north - south anisotropy but this is disfavored due to the consistency of the measured @xmath23 values .",
    "we have also checked that @xmath63 is consistent between north and south , at the 0.05% level .",
    "another possibility is inhomogeneity at the perturbation level , for example an anisotropic stress @xcite . with a quadrupole dependence",
    ", this would not have an effect if the north and south areas were 180@xmath64 apart , but could have a component as they are separated by 145@xmath64 .",
    "also note that the measured velocity dispersion @xmath20 is different in north and south , which could support this .",
    "alternately , the covariance between @xmath20 and @xmath2 is such that high @xmath20 can damp the excess velocity growth of high @xmath2 , so that these ( and the low @xmath20 , low @xmath2 case for the north ) lie along the degeneracy direction with lcdm .",
    "we have carried out an analysis within a framework independent of the cosmological model , i.e.  the specific energy density components such as dark energy or curvature .",
    "this uses the boss dr11 dataset that measures galaxy clustering over the largest volume yet surveyed with an effective redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "we measure the angular distance @xmath1 , expansion rate @xmath23 ( from the radial distance information ) , and velocity growth rate @xmath2 ; all are consistent with the planck lcdm prediction .",
    "these are multiple , model independent tests of lcdm since the implications of each parameter is different .",
    "the measured @xmath1 is insensitive to uncertainties from contamination along the line of sight , but can be affected by the assumption of coherent ( scale - independent ) galaxy bias on the scales used , due to the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "the value of the galaxy bias @xmath27 we derive is also consistent with other measurements . for accurate measurement of @xmath23 , the radial dependence of @xmath15 should be modelled robustly .",
    "for @xmath2 , measured coherent motions are degenerate with the fog effect which is problematic to model . if there is residual contamination from inaccurate modelling of the fog effect ,",
    "the coherent motions and hence velocity growth rate @xmath2 or @xmath31 are underestimated .",
    "since the theoretical model calibrated from simulations becomes increasingly inaccurate on small scales , we carefully examine the dependence of the results on the small scale cutoff in the measurements used .",
    "we find that convergence is achieved for @xmath65 , with bias arising if smaller scales are included  an important caution .",
    "our measurement corresponds to @xmath51 , with the planck lcdm prediction of @xmath52 .    considering the joint likelihood of these cosmological quantities , we find consistency with the planck lcdm model at 68% cl . by comparing the quantities to each other ,",
    "we can make three general consistency tests of the cosmological framework .",
    "we check consistency with the frw framework , with general relativity , and with minimal neutrino mass and find that all are within 68% cl .",
    "comparing the galaxy measurements from the north and south sky samples separately , we continue to find consistency with planck lcdm . here",
    "the reduced effective volume makes the error bars larger , but there are slight discrepancies worth testing with future data from larger surveys such as desi or lsst .",
    "for example , the growth rate in the north has @xmath66 ( @xmath59 from planck lcdm ) while the south has @xmath67 ( though again the error bar is so large that these are consistent within 68% cl ) .",
    "one speculative explanation is the presence of anisotropic stress ( affecting the perturbations while keeping the background quantities consistent ) , but covariance between @xmath2 and @xmath20 ( also measured to be different in north and south ) is another possibility .",
    "again , upcoming larger sky surveys will be valuable in testing cosmology in different directions .",
