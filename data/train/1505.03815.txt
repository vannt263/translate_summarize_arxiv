    "an oscillation is a common but very important phenomenon in the physical world .",
    "if a physical quantity is displaced from the equilibrium a little , negative feedback may then lead to an oscillation .",

    "we try to solve the mass - spring system where the mass of the spring is not negligible .    in 1979",
    ", weinstock studied the normal modes of the oscillator motion for the oscillator attached to a heavy spring by virtue of the stieltjes integral@xcite . in 1994 , nunes da silva obtained the normal frequencies of elastic oscillations of a particle suspended on a spring of non - negligible mass again under the perspective of the renormalization group theory@xcite .",
    "a continuous spring can be regarded as a chain of many small springs coupling an equal amount of small masses .",
    "we then repeat mapping process by associating two consecutive small springs into a single one . at",
    "last , we only need to focus our attention on boundary effects .",
    "da silva dealt with the problem only for the simplest situation , without the friction and applied force , and the advantage of this method does not emerge in the simplest case .",
    "in fact , we can not only find out the normal frequencies in the conservative system , but also obtain the specific equation of motion when external forces are acted on . in the next sections ,",
    "we first explore the most general condition , a forced vibration with friction , with the help of the renormalization method",
    ". then we deal with a special case analytically where the renormalization method can fail to work .",
    "we derive the equations and investigate the generalized orthogonality of the base set of the solution , and then obtain the normal modes of a damping oscillator attached to a heavy spring .",
