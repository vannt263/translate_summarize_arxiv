    "recently a new class of material , called topological insulator , has been paid much attention by condensed matter physicists @xcite .",
    "topological insulator ( ti ) shows the conduction of electrons on the surface of 3d materials otherwise behaves as an insulator .",
    "it is due to the time - reversal symmetry possessed by materials like bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , sb@xmath3te@xmath4 and bi@xmath3te@xmath4@xcite .",
    "the conducting surface states of these material show a single dirac cone , in which spin is always locked perpendicular to it s momentum .",
    "the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite or scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite has been used to realize the single dirac cone in tis . in two - dimensional electron systems , under the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , electron conducts along the boundary due to the circular orbits bouncing off the edges , leading to skipping orbits .",
    "however , in 3d materials , even in absence of magnetic field electron conduction takes place on the surface . here , strong rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) plays the role of magnetic field .",
    "the rsoc originates from the lack of structural inversion symmetry of the sample @xcite .",
    "+ though there have been several experimental works on the surface states of tis , one of the major obstacle in studying the transport properties of the surface is the unavoidable contribution of the bulk .",
    "one of the best method to minimize this problem is to grow tis sample in the form of ultra - thin films , in which bulk contribution becomes relatively very small in comparison to the surface contribution@xcite .",
    "the transition from 3d to 2d tis lead to several effects which have been studied for different thickness@xcite .",
    "the ultra - thin ti not only reduces the bulk contribution , but also possesses some new phenomenon like possible excitonic superfluidity @xcite , unique magneto - optical response@xcite and better thermoelectric performances@xcite .",
    "moreover , the small thickness leads to the overlap of the wave functions between top and bottom surfaces which introduces a new degree of freedom hybridization@xcite .",
    "however , it happens to a certain thickness of five to ten quintuple layers@xcite i.e ; of the order of 10 nm .",
    "the oscillating exponential decay of hybridization induced band gap with reducing thickness in bi@xmath3te@xmath4 has been also reported theoretically@xcite .",
    "the formation of landau levels have been confirmed by several experiments@xcite in thin tis .",
    "moreover , several theoretical study on low - temperature transport properties in a series of works@xcite have been reported .",
    "+ thermoelectric properties of materials @xcite have always been interesting topic for providing an additional way in exploring the details of an electronic system .",
    "when a temperature gradient is applied across the two ends of the electronic system , the migration of electrons from hotter to cooler side leads to the developement of a voltage gradient across these ends .",
    "this voltage difference per unit temperature gradient is known as longitudinal thermopower .",
    "in addition to this temperature gradient if a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the system , due to lorentz force , a transverse electric field is also established and gives transverse thermopower . in conventional 2d electronic system ,",
    "landau levels induced quantum oscillation ( shubnikov - de hass ) in thermoelectric coefficients has been reported theoretically as well as experimentally in a series of works@xcite . in 3d tis ,",
    "improvement of thermoelectric performance without magnetic field have been predicted theoretically in a series of paper@xcite . in the",
    "newly emerged relativistic - like 2d electron system - graphene , thermoelectric effects have been also studied@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of hybridization on the thermopower and the thermal conductivity of the ultra - thin tis in absence / presence of magnetic field .",
    "we find thermopower increases and thermal conductivity decreases with increase of the hybridization energy when magnetic field is absent . in presence of perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "thermoelectric coefficients oscillate with inverse magnetic field .",
    "the frequency of the quantum oscillations is strongly modified by the zeeman energy , and phase factor is determined by the product of the lande @xmath0-factor and the hybridization energy .",
    "the analytical expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients are also obtained .",
    "it is also shown that these transport coefficients oscillate with frequency depend on hybridization energy and lande @xmath0-factor .",
    "this paper has following structure .",
    "section ii briefly discusses energy spectrum and the density of states of the ultra - thin ti in absence and presence of magnetic field . in section iii , we have studied how the hybridization affects the thermoelectric coefficients for zero magnetic field . in section iv , a complete analysis of thermoelectric coefficients in present of magnetic field is provided with numerical and analytical results .",
