    "the three - gluon coupling is perhaps the most obvious manifestation of the non - abelian aspect of quantum chromodynamics @xcite ( see also the reviews @xcite ) .",

    "the associated casimir invariant has even been measured directly in studies of four - jet events at lep @xcite , the su(3 ) group being consistent with the data .    apart from being a standard object of consideration in textbooks on quantum field theory and qcd ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ,",
    "the perturbative corrections to gluonic vertices are also very important in real physical calculations , such as multijet production at the hadron colliders ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . at the present level of accuracy , one needs to perform not only calculations with on - shell external particles , there are also contributions where general off - shell results are needed",
    ".    one of the original reasons the three - gluon vertex was studied was the belief that its infrared properties might shed light on the mechanism of confinement . in these studies ,",
    "different approaches were used , some of which are discussed in the review @xcite ( and references therein ) .    for special cases ,",
    "the one - loop results for the three - gluon coupling have been known for many years .",
    "celmaster and gonsalves ( cg ) presented in 1979 @xcite the one - loop result for the vertex , for off - shell gluons , restricted to the symmetric case , @xmath5 , in an arbitrary covariant gauge .",
    "ball and chiu ( bc ) then in 1980 considered the general off - shell case , but restricted to the feynman gauge @xcite . later , various on - shell results have also been given , by brandt and frenkel ( bf ) @xcite , restricted to the infrared - singular parts only ( in an arbitrary covariant gauge ) , and by nowak , praszaowicz and somiski ( nps ) @xcite , who also gave the finite parts for the case of two gluons being on - shell ( in feynman gauge ) .",
    "an overview of these results is given in the table below .",
    ".kinematics and gauges considered in other studies [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     from this table one can see that , even if we consider the results in ( or around ) four dimensions , there are still several `` white spots '' .",
    "they correspond not only to the most general case ( the lower left corner ) , but also to some other cases when the results are missing , either for quark loop contributions or for the finite parts .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to cover _ all _ such remaining spots ( for the case when massless quarks are considered ) .",
    "moreover , we present results which are valid for an _ arbitrary _ value of the space - time dimension .",

    "are needed to decompose the three - gluon vertex @xcite .",
    "thus , six scalar functions multiplying these tensor structures are to be calculated .",
    "these scalar functions depend on the gauge parameter , the space - time dimension , and the kinematical invariants ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "there are several reasons why the one - loop results calculated in arbitrary gauge and dimension @xmath9 are of special interest : + ( i ) knowing the results in arbitrary gauge , one can explicitly keep track of gauge invariance for physical quantities ; + ( ii ) if one is interested in the two - loop calculation of the three - gluon coupling , one should know one - loop contributions in more detail ; + ( iii ) results in arbitrary dimension make it possible to consider all on - shell limits ( when some @xmath10 ) _ directly _ from these expressions ( see section  4 ) , this is impossible if one only has the results valid around four dimensions ; + ( iv ) qcd is also a theory of interest in three and two dimensions ( see e.g.  @xcite and the review @xcite ) ; + ( v ) as we shall see , the results for arbitrary dimension are not much more cumbersome than those considered around four dimensions ( in some respects , they are even more transparent and instructive ) .",
    "we note that in several papers the one - loop three - gluon vertex in axial - type gauges ( including the light - cone gauge ) was considered @xcite ( mainly divergent parts and special limits have been studied ) .",
    "the three - gluon vertex in the background field formalism was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the gauge - invariant vertex was studied in ref .",
    "moreover , there were some lattice calculations of the three - gluon vertex , see e.g.  ref .",
    "we shall not address these issues here , but concentrate instead on the _ standard _ vertex in an arbitrary _ covariant _ gauge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce the notation for the two- and three - point functions to be considered , and discuss their decomposition in terms of scalar functions as well as the corresponding ward  slavnov  taylor identity . in section  3 ,",
    "we present the most general off - shell results for the three - gluon vertex .",
    "section  4 contains the corresponding expressions for all on - shell limits of interest . in section  5",
    ", we conclude with a summary and a discussion of the results .",
    "then , we have several appendices where some further results and technical details are presented , such as the formulae used to decompose the three - gluon vertex ( appendix  a ) , relevant results for the scalar integrals involved ( appendix  b ) , results for the self energies ( appendix  c ) and the ghost - gluon vertex ( appendix  d ) , expressions for the on - shell limit @xmath11 in arbitrary gauge ( appendix  e ) , and also some results for @xmath12 ( appendix  f ) .",
    "the yang  mills term of the qcd lagrangian yields the following well - known expression for the lowest - order three - gluon vertex : @xmath13 , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the momenta of the gluons , all of which are ingoing , @xmath16 . in ( [ 2eq : tree - level ] ) ,",

    "when one calculates radiative corrections to the three - gluon vertex ( the corresponding one - loop diagrams are presented in fig .  1 ) , other tensor structures arise , in addition to the lowest - order expression ( [ 2eq : tree - level ] ) , and the general tensor decomposition should be considered . if we take into account momentum conservation ( only two of the external momenta are independent ) , fourteen independent tensor structures carrying three lorentz indices exist , and in general @xmath24 can be written as a sum of these tensors multiplied by scalar functions ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this decomposition is useful for extracting the corresponding scalar functions from the result of a calculation .",
    "although bosonic symmetry of the vertex puts some conditions on the corresponding scalar functions , the explicit symmetry of the expression is broken , because one of the momenta was substituted in terms of two others .    to avoid this",
