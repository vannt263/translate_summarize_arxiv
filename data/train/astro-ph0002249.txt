    "the discovery of temperature anisotropies in the cmb by the cobe team ( smoot 1992 ) heralded a new era in cosmology .",
    "for the first time cobe provided a clear detection of the primordial fluctuations responsible for the formation of structure in the universe at a time when they were still in the linear growth regime . since then , a large number of ground based and balloon borne experiments have been performed which have succeeded in defining the shape of the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 are determined from a spherical harmonic expansion of the temperature anisotropies on the sky , @xmath6 . ] up to multipoles of @xmath7 clearly defining the first acoustic peak in the spectrum .",

    "the points plotted in figure 1 are generally consistent with each other and provide strong evidence for a peak in the power spectrum at @xmath10 .    in this introductory article",
    ", i will review briefly the theory of cmb anisotropies in adiabatic models of structure formation and then discuss the implications of figure 1 for values of cosmological parameters .",

    "the general dependence of the cmb power spectrum on cosmological parameters is therefore clear .",

    "the relative amplitudes of the peaks depend on the physical densities of the various constituents @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , _ etc . _ and on the scalar fluctuation spectrum ( parameterized here by a constant spectral index @xmath73 ) .",
    "clearly , models with the same initial fluctuation spectra and identical physical matter densities @xmath74 will have identical cmb power spectra at high multipoles if they have the same angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "this leads to a strong _ geometrical degeneracy _ between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( _ e.g. _",
    "efstathiou and bond 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the power spectrum on large angular scales ( equation 9 ) is sensitive to the spectral index and amplitude of the power spectrum , geometry of the universe and , for extreme values of @xmath77 can break the geometrical degeneracy via the late - time sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "we will discuss briefly some of the constraints on cosmological parameters from the current cmb data in the next section . before moving on to this topic ,",
    "i mention some important points that can not be covered in detail because of space limitations :    @xmath78 inflationary models can give rise to tensor perturbations with a characteristic spectrum that declines sharply at @xmath79 ( see _ e.g. _ bond 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "in power - law like inflation , the tensor spectral index @xmath80 is closely linked to the scalar spectral index , @xmath81 , and to the relative amplitude of the tensor and scalar perturbations .    @xmath78 the anisotropy of thomson scattering causes the cmb anisotropies to be linearly polarized at the level of a few percent ( see bond 1996 , hu and white 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "measurements of the linear polarization can distinguish between tensor and scalar perturbations and can constrain the epoch of reionization of the intergalactic medium ( zaldarriaga , spergel and seljak 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath78 the main effect of reionization is to depress the amplitude of the power spectrum at high multipoles by a factor of @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the optical depth to thomson scattering . in the ` best fit ' cdm universe described in the next section ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath3 ) and a reionization redshift of @xmath87 ( a plausible value ) @xmath88 which is significant .",
    "there is a reasonable chance that we might learn something about the ` dark ages ' of cosmic history from precision measurements of the cmb .",
    "in this section , we review some of the constraints on cosmological parameters from the cmb data plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the analysis is similar to that presented in efstathiou ( 1999 , hereafter e99 ) , in which we map the full likelihood function in @xmath89 parameters @xmath76 , @xmath75 , @xmath90 , @xmath73 and @xmath91 ( the amplitude of @xmath92 at @xmath93 relative to that inferred from cobe ) .",
    "the baryon density is constrained to @xmath84 , as determined from primordial nucleosynthesis and deuterium abundances measurements from quasar spectra ( burles and tytler 1998 ) .",
    "the results presented below are insensitive to modest variations ( @xmath94 ) of @xmath95 and illustrate the main features of cosmological parameter estimation from the cmb .",
    "recently , tegmark and zaldarriaga ( 2000 ) have performed a heroic @xmath96 parameter fit to the cmb data , including a tensor contribution and finite optical depth from reionization .",
    "i will discuss the effects of widening the parameter space briefly below but refer the reader to tegmark and zaldarriaga for a detailed analysis .",
    "the best fit model in this five parameter space is plotted as the solid line in figure 1 .",
    "it is encouraging that the best fitting model has perfectly reasonable parameters , a spatially flat universe with a nearly scale invariant fluctuation spectrum and a low cdm density @xmath97 .",
    "marginalised likelihood functions are plotted in various projections in the parameter space in figures 2 , 3 and 5 ( uniform priors are assumed in computing the marginalized likelihoods , as described in e99 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows constraints on the position of the first acoustic peak measured by the ` location ' parameter @xmath98 _ i.e. _ the parameter @xmath99 measures the location of the acoustic peak relative to that in a spatially flat model with zero cosmological constant .",
    "the geometrical degeneracy between @xmath75 and @xmath76 described in the previous section is expressed by @xmath100 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the best fitting value is @xmath101 with a @xmath102 range of about @xmath103 .",
    "the position of the first acoustic peak in the cmb data thus provides powerful evidence that the universe is close to spatially flat .",
    "figure @xmath104 shows the marginalized likelihoods in the @xmath105 and @xmath106 planes .",
    "the constraints on @xmath91 and @xmath73 are not very different to those from the analysis of cobe alone ( see _ e.g. _ bond 1996 )",
    ". the experiments at higher multipoles are so degenerate with variations in other cosmological parameters that they do not help tighten the constraints on @xmath91 and @xmath73 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath90 and @xmath73 show an interesting result ; if @xmath107 , then the best fit value of @xmath90 is about @xmath108 with a @xmath102 upper limit of about @xmath109 .",
    "this constraint on @xmath90 comes from the height of the first acoustic peak , as shown in figure 4 . in this diagram ,",
    "the cmb data points have been averaged in @xmath96 band - power estimates as described by bond , knox and jaffe ( 1998 ) .",
    "the solid curve shows the best - fit model as plotted in figure 1 , which has @xmath110 .",
    "the dashed lines show models with @xmath111 and @xmath112 with the other parameters held fixed .",
    "raising @xmath90 lowers the height of the peak and vice - versa .",
    "this result is not very sensitive to variations of @xmath95 in the neighbourhood of @xmath113 .",
    "reionization and the addition of a tensor component can lower the height of the first peak relative to the anisotropies at lower multipoles and so the upper limits on @xmath90 are robust to the addition of these parameters .",
    "the cmb data have now reached the point where we have good constraints on the height of the first peak , as well as its location , and this is beginning to set interesting constraints on @xmath90 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath114 , derived from combining the cmb data with results from distant type ia supernovae ( see figure 5 ) implies @xmath115 for a hubble constant of @xmath85 , consistent with the low values of @xmath90 favoured by the height of the first acoustic peak .",
    "the left hand panel of figure 5 shows the marginalized likelihood for the cmb data in the @xmath76@xmath75 plane .",
    "the likelihood peaks along the line for spatially flat universes @xmath116 and it is interesting to compare with the equivalent figure in e99 to see how the new experimental results of the last year have caused the likelihood contours to narrow down around @xmath117 .",
    "( see also dodelson and knox 1999 for a similar analysis using the latest cmb data ) .",
    "as is well known , the magnitude - redshift relation for distant type ia supernovae results in nearly orthogonal constraints in the @xmath76@xmath75 plane , so combining the supernovae and cmb data can break the geometrical degeneracy . the right hand panel in figure 5",
    "combines the cmb likelihood function derived here with the likelihood function of the supernovae sample of perlmutter ( 1999 ) as analysed in e99 .",
    "the combined likelihood function is peaked at @xmath114 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is remarkable how the cmb data and the supernovae data are homing in on a consistent set of cosmological parameters that are compatible with the simplest inflationary models and also with parameters inferred from a number of other observations ( _ e.g. _ galaxy clustering , baryon content of clusters and dynamical estimates of the mean mass density , see bahcall 1999 for a review ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that the ` best fit ' model requires a non - zero cosmological constant , a result that few cosmologists would have thought likely a few years ago .",
    "the next few years will see a revolutionary increase in the volume and quality of cmb data .",
    "the results of the boomerang antarctic flight are awaited with great interest and should be of sufficient quality to render all previous analyses of cosmological parameters from the cmb obsolete .",
    "the polarization of the cmb has not yet been discovered , but a number of ground based and balloon borne experiments designed to detect polarization are under construction ( staggs , gundersen and church 1999 ) .",
    "the map satellite , scheduled for launch in late 2000 , will have polarization sensitivity and should determine the power spectrum @xmath4 accurately to about @xmath118 , defining the first three acoustic peaks . further into the future , the planck satellite , scheduled for launch in 2007 , should determine the power spectrum to @xmath119 , provide sensitive polarization measurements and extremely accurate subtraction of foregrounds .",
    "evidently , the era of precision cosmology is upon us and the next decade should see a dramatic improvement in our knowledge of fundamental cosmological parameters and in our understanding of the origin of fluctuations in the early universe .",
