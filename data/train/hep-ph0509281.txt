    "axial - vector properties of the nucleon provide deep insight in understanding its internal structure .",
    "for instance , the measured first moment @xmath5 of the proton spin structure function  @xcite is directly related to the quark content of the nucleon at a fixed @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the spin structure function of the proton , and the @xmath9 are the singlet and non - singlet combinations of the first moments of the parton distributions : @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the first moments of the non - singlet coefficient functions which can be computed in perturbative qcd .",
    "the first moments @xmath9 can be identified as the axial - vector constants @xmath13 in the quark parton model . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath14 is just interpreted in the quark parton model as the fraction of the proton angular momentum carried by the intrinsic spins of the quarks .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related to semi - leptonic decays .",
    "thus , the axial - vector constants provide essential information on understanding the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "recently , parity - violating asymmetries of the polarized electrons scattered off the nucleon have been intensively measured  @xcite , since two neutral electroweak form factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the proton can be extracted from the asymmetries .",
    "once these form factors are known , one can combine them with @xmath19 and @xmath20 and can disentangle the up , down , and strange quark contributions to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "however , it is also essential to know information on the neutral weak axial - vector form factor , @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for the triplet axial - vector form factor of which the value at @xmath24 is just the axial - vector constant @xmath15 determined from nucleon @xmath25 decay . note that @xmath6 is the positive four - momentum transfer , @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 denotes the strange axial - vector form factor and its value at @xmath24 is the strange quark content of the nucleon spin .",
    "these axial - vector form factors have been experimentally investigated by quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite and by pion electroproduction @xcite .",
    "there a dipole - type parametrization has been used to extract the strange - vector form factors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite in detail ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the axial dipole mass .",
    "apparently , the axial - vector properties of the nucleon shed light on the structure of the nucleon in various aspects .",
    "though a correct theoretical description of the structure of the nucleon should be based on qcd , which would automatically include the excitation of @xmath30 pairs in the nucleon , it is rather difficult to perform in practice such a calculation .",
    "it is even very hard to use lattice gauge techniques because they still suffer from technical problems , in particular , in treating light quarks .",
    "thus , we need to use appropriate models which reflect important characteristics of qcd such as chiral symmetry and its spontaneous symmetry breaking and which treat the relevant degrees of freedom in some good approximation . in this sense , the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath31qsm )",
    "provides a proper theoretical framework .",
    "it is an effective quark theory of qcd in the limit of @xmath32 concentrating on the instanton - degrees of freedom of the qcd vacuum and resulting in an effective action for valence and sea quarks both moving in a static self - consistent goldstone background field  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon arises from this effective interaction as a chiral soliton .",
    "it has successfully been applied to various properties of the baryons  @xcite and to forward and generalized parton distributions  @xcite and has lead even to the prediction of the heavily discussed pentaquark baryon @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the present authors have recently investigated the strange vector form factors  @xcite , utilizing the symmetry - conserving quantization scheme suggested by praszaowicz _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we predicted the sample , happex , a4 , and g0 experiments  @xcite .",
    "results have shown a fairly good agreement with experimental data of the a4 , sample , and happex . however , since the experimental uncertainties are rather large , it is hard to judge any theoretical calculation . while the extracted strange vector form factors appear to have large experimental uncertainties , the parity - violating asymmetries are measured with relatively good precision .",
    "thus , the parity - violating asymmetries may be more reliable to justify the model descriptions .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to study all three axial - vector form factors within the framework of the @xmath31qsm , focusing on the strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "in fact , axial - vector properties of the nucleon have to some extent already been studied in the su(2 ) and su(3 ) @xmath31qsm , previously  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies were not complete and some of them did not use the symmetry conserving quantization method  @xcite , which guarantees that the gell - mann - nishijima relations are obeyed . hence , we will calculate all axial - vector form factors in this work , employing the symmetry - conserving quantization .",
    "we will follow also the same set of parameters we used for deriving the strange vector form factors so that the parity - violating asymmetries may be studied  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly show how to derive the axial - vector form factors in the @xmath31qsm .",
    "in section iii , we present the results and discuss them . in section iv , we summarize and draw the conclusion of the present work .",
    "in the present section we briefly mention the general expression for the axial - vector form factors in the @xmath31qsm ( see also reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the axial - vector form factors are expressed in terms of the following quark matrix elements : @xmath34 u_{n}(p , s_3 ) , \\label{eq : ff1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the axial - vector and induced pseudoscalar form factors , respectively .",
    "note that we ignore the form factor of the second kind , _",
    "i.e. _ the induced pseudotensor form factor , since it is irrelevant to the present work .",
    "the @xmath37 is the square of the four momentum transfer @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for the nucleon mass and its spinor with the third component of the nucleon spin , respectively .",
    "the axial - vector quark current @xmath42 can be expressed in euclidean space as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "since we are interested in the axial - vector form factors of the nucleon in low - energy regions ( @xmath45 ) , we will work in the breit frame , where the time component of the axial - vector current vanishes .",
    "thus , the axial - vector form factors can be related only to the space component of the axial - vector current .",
    "this is no real restriction since its time component is suppressed in the large @xmath46 limit , compared to the spatial one .",
    "having carried out a tedious but straightforward calculation following refs.@xcite , we derive the expressions for the triplet ( @xmath47 ) and octet ( @xmath48 ) axial - vector densities of the nucleon :    @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{m}{e}\\int r^{2}dr\\left[j_{0}\\left (   \\left| \\bm{q}\\right| r\\right ) a_{0}^{\\chi , b}(r)-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}j_{2}\\left (   \\left| \\bm{q}\\right| r\\right )   a_{2}^{\\chi , b}(r)\\right ] , \\label{eq : axff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the on - shell energy of the nucleon , @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the spherical bessel functions .",
    "the @xmath55 is the third component of the axial - vector current in eq.([eq : scur ] ) and the @xmath56 denotes the second - rank spherical tensors .",
    "having carried out the symmetry conserving collective quantization with the linear @xmath4 corrections as well as rotational @xmath3 corrections taken into account , we end up with the following expressions for eq.([eq : a01 ] ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the moments of inertia of the soliton .",
    "the @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the singlet and octet components of the quark mass matrix : @xmath62 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath65 is the totally symmetric tensor in su(3 ) .",
    "the @xmath66 represent the su(3 ) wigner functions and @xmath67 stand for their matrix elements sandwiched between the collective nucleon wave functions .",
    "these matrix elements are finally expressed in terms of the su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "note that here we tacitly have considered the wave function corrections arising from su(3)-symmetry breaking , which mixes the pure nucleon state with states in higher representations .",
    "the nucleon state @xmath68 is the third component of the spin operator .",
    "the explicit expressions for the quark densities , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 can be found in appendix .",
    "note that the matrix element @xmath76 in eq.([eq : a02 ] ) can be put into the same form as eq.([eq : expa0 ] ) , except for replacing the operators in eq.([eq : expa0 ] ) by others which are given in table  [ tab : a0toa2 ] . actually , in flavor su(2 ) , the above su(3 ) expressions are reduced to the isoscalar and isovector ones as follows : @xmath77 where the operators required for the function @xmath78 in su(2 ) can be read out from table  [ tab : a0toa2 ] .",
    ".[tab : a0toa2]this table shows how to obtain @xmath79 by replacing operators .",
    "the factor @xmath80 comes from @xmath81 and @xmath82 from @xmath83 . [",
    "cols=\">,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the axial - vector constants , corresponding radii , and the dipole axial - vector masses are summarized in table  [ tab : axconst ] .",
    "the present results are in general good agreement with the existing experimental data .",
    "the present investigation posseses one noticeable virtue : since we are able to calculate the axial - vector form factors together with the strange electromagnetic ones within the same scheme , we can directly get access to the electroweak interactions of the proton . in order to calculate the parity - violating asymmetries of the polarized electrons scattered off the proton ,",
    "we must have all required form factors derived consistently .",
    "actually , combining the present results of the axial - vector form factors together with the strange vector form factors , we can proceed to delve into the parity - violating asymmetries . since the parity - violating asymmetries have been and will be measured in different kinematical regions with a good precision",
    ", they will provide a criterion for theoretical works .",
    "the parity - violating asymmetries of polarized electron - proton scattering is presently under investigation .",
