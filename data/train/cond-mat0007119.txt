    "since the discovery of high @xmath4 cuprates a wide variety of experiments have shown strong evidence of a link between anomalies in lattice structure and the onset of superconductivity in these materials . for a review of experiments and analysis",
    "please see @xcite .",
    "ion channeling experiments@xcite show anomalous changes in the oscillation amplitudes of cu and o atoms at and above @xmath0 .",
    "ultrasonic measurements@xcite shows anomalies in elastic constants .",
    "infrared reflectivity measurements@xcite of high quality samples have shown clear connection between c - axis phonon modes and the charge carriers .",
    "recently it is seen@xcite that both @xmath0 and the buckling angle of the @xmath1 planes goes through a maximum as the doping is varied .",
    "the buckling corresponds to a static displacement of the oxygen atoms out of the plane , with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the displacement of the oxygen atoms at @xmath7 along the @xmath3 axis , @xmath8 being the @xmath9 atom position .    in inelastic neutron scsaterring experiments@xcite it",
    "is also seen that the buckling mode phonon at 340 cm @xmath10 ( called @xmath11 ) softens by more than 1 % accross the transition temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "other modes having frequency close to the 340 cm@xmath10 mode like @xmath13 ( 307 cm@xmath10 ) and @xmath14 ( 347 cm@xmath10 ) and @xmath15 ( 285 cm @xmath10 ) are studied in detail by inelastic neutron scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 mode corresponds to the vibrations of the planar oxygen atoms out of the plane , and out of phase with the adjacent cuo plane(buckling mode ) .",
    "the @xmath15 ( here the oxygen atoms in two adjacent planes vibrate in phase and out of the plane ) , and the @xmath16 mode ( here the atoms vibrate in the plane ) shows much less softening ( estimated to be less than .4% and .3% respectively@xcite ) .",
    "this compares well with the optical data though for the @xmath16 there is no optical data available to compare with .    in this paper",
    "we shall be exploring the phenomena of static buckling of the planes as well as the the phonon mode softening within the interlayer tunneling mechanism of wheatley , hsu and anderson(wha)@xcite and its more refined version proposed by chakraborty et al@xcite .",
    "we will show that @xmath17 and the buckling angle varies with doping concentration the same way .",
    "this and the large softening of the buckling mode phonon can all be understood in a unifying way .",
    "the main ingradient of this mechanism is that the normal state is a non fermi liquid and hence the single particle hopping out of planes becomes incoherent .",
    "however coherent propagation of pairs of particles becomes favourable at low enough temperatures leading to coherent pair fluctuation and the consequent superconductivity .",
    "the induced josephson coupling between the planes , or the amplitude for pair tuneling is quadratic in @xmath18 ( bare single particle hopping amplitude between the planes ) .",
    "any static displacement or dynamic fluctuations of the atoms in the unit cell that modulates the distance between the planes effectively modulates the pair tunneling amplitude between the planes . the main thesis of our paper , being , since the @xmath11 mode effectively brings the planes closer together leading to a decrease of the hopping paths for the electrons between the planes .",
    "this in turn makes the josephson coupling stronger , the electronic system gains energy by condensation and the corresponding optical phonon mode(@xmath19 ) frequency gets softer , leading also to an average static buckling .",
    "we find that the greater part of the large frequency shift observed for the @xmath11 mode(buckling mode ) is due to the screening by interlayer pair propagation , or due pair current - phonon coupling .",
    "the @xmath15 mode on the other hand , being in phase oscillations of the atoms keeps the distance between the planes unchanged and so it does not couple with the pair - current flow accross the planes .",
    "we begin by writing the gap equation from interlayer tunneling @xcite , @xmath20 this equation can be obtained by considering two close cu - o layers as in bi 2212 coupled by a josephson tunneling term of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bare single electron hopping term between the two coupled layers @xmath3 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a band structure parameter in the dispersion of electrons along the cu - o plane . finally , @xmath25 in the right hand side of equation ( 1 ) is given by @xmath26 .",
    "where @xmath27 .",
    "the dispersion of electrons along the cu - o plane is chosen to be of the form @xmath28 with @xmath24 = 0.25 ev , @xmath29 = 0.45 @xmath30 .",
    "we also choose @xmath31 = -0.45 ev corresponding to a fermi surface which is closed around the @xmath32 point .",
    "these choices are inspired by band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "note that the josephson coupling term in @xmath33 conserves the individual momenta of the electrons that get paired by hopping across the coupled layers .",
    "this is as opposed to a bcs scattering term which would only conserve the center of mass momenta of the pairs .",
    "this is the origin of all features that are unique to the interlayer tunneling mechanism .",
    "this term has a local @xmath34 invariance in @xmath35-space and can not by itself give a finite @xmath36 .",
    "it needs an additional bcs type non local interaction in the planes which could be induced by phonons or residual correlations .",
    "here we assume the inplane pairing interaction to be d - wave kind i.e , @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath25 can be infered from electronic structurecalculations . as shown in reference@xcite",
    ", it is adequate to choose @xmath39 . according to anderson , it is the @xmath35-space locality that leads to a scale of @xmath0 that is linear in interlayer pair tunneling matrix element .",
    "he finds that in the limit @xmath40 , @xmath41 and in the other limit , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 are debye frequency , density of states at the fermi energy , and fermi surface average matrix element @xmath46 . the important point being that even with a little help from the in plane pairing interaction the interlayer tunneling term can provide a large scale of @xmath0 . in our naive analysis with a fixed cut off",
    "@xmath43 we find that the @xmath0 drops when the fermi surface moves away from the @xmath47 point in a parabolic fashion .",
    "this because of ( 1 ) . the density of states is large near the @xmath48 points , and only for the optical concentrations , the fermi surface touches these regions , and ( 2 ) the momentum dependence of both the inplane bcs pairing interaction(d - wave kind ) and the interlayer pair tunneling amplitude are such that they have large values near the @xmath48 also .",
    "so in a way the @xmath17 going through a maximum near the optimal doping concentration , is expected for both the interlayer tunneling mechanism and as well as for ordinary d - wave superconductor .",
    "now we shall discuss the variation of the buckling angle with the doping concentration .",
    "some other feature of the wha mechanism are , ( 1 ) .",
    "the gap values near the @xmath49(@xmath50 ) points are very much temperature insentive at low temperatures , and drops rapidly to zero near the @xmath0 .",
    "it is also very sensitive to small doping variations , near the optimal doping concentrations , i.e as the fermi surface moves away from the @xmath49 points because it can not then take advantage of the large pair tunneling amplitudes near those points in the bz .",
    "the gaps along the diagonal direction in the bz(@xmath51 directions ) are on the other hand very sensitive to temperature variations , falling faster than bcs with temperature .",
    "it is also insensitive to small doping variations near the optimal doping concentrations .",
    "we shall discuss the possible consequences of these features of the wha gap later .",
    "the interlayer pair hopping term for a bilayer system is , @xmath52 now the interlayer hopping matrix element @xmath18 will be modulated due to the vibration out of plane of the oxygen atoms .",
    "we emphasize here again , that for the @xmath15 mode the atoms all vibrate out of the cuo planes but the vibrations in two adjacent layers are in phase and hence the effective tunneling matrix element of the zhang - rice orbitals ( a linear combination of the oxygen @xmath53 orbitals ) from plane to plane do nt change , but for the @xmath11 mode @xmath18 will change .",
    "we can do a taylor expansion of @xmath18 in small oxygen atom displacements .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath3 is the z direction layer separation and @xmath55 is a constant of the order of one . putting this back in the interlayer term we get the extra piece , @xmath56 with these modifications the total effective hamiltonian for the phonon modes corresponding to oxygen vibration out of plane ,",
    "will be given by : @xmath57 where we have taken the anomolous averages . as we can see that the second term renormalises the frequency of the buckling mode phonon , and the term linear @xmath58 shifts the harmonic oscillators without affecting its energy(this",
    "will correspond to static displacement of the oxygen atoms causing buckling of the @xmath1 planes ) .",
    "the renormalised frequency of the buckling mode phonon @xmath59 and the static displacement of the oxygen atoms out of the plane @xmath60 is given by , @xmath61 where , @xmath62    we take @xmath63 to be equal to 340 cm@xmath10 or 10.2 thz for @xmath64 . in fig : 1 and 2 , we show the doping variation of both the superconducting @xmath17 and the buckling angle @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the latice spacing(cu - o - cu distance ) .",
    "we see that both @xmath17 and angle @xmath67 scales the same way with the doping concentration .",
    "as we have seen before , due to the momentum dependence of the pair tunneling amplitude at the optimal doping concentration , large number of pairs can delocalize by tunneling from plane to planes(thereby reducing the kinetic energy ) .",
    "the buckling mode phonon helps in this process .",
    "that is why the buckling mode phonon frequency softens and also develops a static buckling distortion .",
    "now let us take a look at the phonon frequency softening below @xmath17 for different phonon modes .",
    "we shall specifically look at the @xmath11 and @xmath15 modes ( corresponding to out of phase and inphase vibrations of the oxygen atoms at adjacent bilayers ) .",
    "superconductivity induced change in frequency and linewidths have been used to estimate the superconducting gap function .",
    "this is accomplished by determining the phonon self energy changes that occur below the @xmath17 .",
    "the imaginary part of the phonon self energy is proportional to the phonon linewidth ( inverse lifetime ) which is measured as a function of temperature .",
    "if the phonon energy is less than twice the gap energy , it can not decay by pair breaking and thus a decrease in linewidth below @xmath17 can result because of a decrease in the number of available decay channels . if the phonon energy is greater than the gap , it has sufficient energy to dissociate an electron pair and the number of possible decay routes can increase below @xmath17 , resulting in an increase in linewidth .",
    "the real part of the self energy is proportional to the phonon energy and the superconductivity induced changes are determined from a measurement of the phonon frequency as a function of temperature below @xmath17 .",
    "qualitatively one expects that , for phonon energies below or near the gap , the electron phonon interaction will push the frequencies to smaller values .",
    "conversely for larger energy phonons ( @xmath68 ) are expected to undergo a hardening .",
    "the phonon self energy , assuming a polarisation bubble with no vertex correction is given by , @xmath69\\tau_3 g(k , i\\omega_n))\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a pauli matrix , @xmath71 is the fully interacting green s function , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the fermion(boson ) matsubara frequencies , and @xmath74 is the electron phonon matrix element for scattering an electron of momentum @xmath35 to @xmath75 with momentum transfer @xmath76 to or from a phonon with branch index @xmath77 .",
    "the standard electron phonon interaction being , @xmath78 in bcs theory the superconducting green s function is , @xmath79 substituting this in the earlier equation and taking @xmath19 we get , @xmath80}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "raman shift is the difference between the superconducting and normal state self energies , where normal state self energy can be extraced from the above equaition by putting @xmath83 .",
    "one still has to analytically continue ( @xmath84 and the real part describes the frequency shift and the imaginary part describes the change in phonon linewidth upon entering the superconducting state .",
    "the simplest method of evaluating it , is to numerically evaluate it on the lattice after solving the self consistent gap equation .",
    "we have done so in this paper .",
    "we borrow the estimates of the electron phonon coupling function from the estimates by normand et al@xcite , i.e. @xmath85 $ ] where @xmath24 is the inplane hopping matrix element , @xmath58 is the small oscillation amplitude of the oxygen atoms out of the plane , and @xmath66 is the lattice parameter . also for the @xmath11 mode symmetry ( @xmath86 ) and for the @xmath15 mode ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the electron phonon coupling function @xmath88 for @xmath11 and @xmath13 phonons will be @xmath89 , where @xmath90 for @xmath11 and @xmath15 phonon mode .",
    "the constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the mass of the oxygen atom and the bare phonon frequencies(@xmath19 ) in the normal state for the @xmath11 and @xmath15(340 cm@xmath10 and 307 cm@xmath10 ) modes .",
    "this contribution to phonon frequency softening is due to the screening by the charge carriers in the planes .",
    "we have already calculated the phonon mode softening due to interlayer pair hopping process(additional screening due to pair tunneling process ) .",
    "both the contributions that shifts the phonon frequencis , the usual self energy contribution and the screening effect due to the pair propagation along the c - axis are shown as a function of temperature for the @xmath11 and @xmath15 phonon modes in fig.3 and 4 .    for the @xmath15 phonon the second contribution will be missing and",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "we see that the pair tunneling contribution is much larger than that of screening by inplane charge carriers .",
    "seecndly from the form of electron phonon coupling function @xmath93 as well as the pair hopping contribution(the @xmath35 dependence of @xmath22 ) , it is clear that , the contributions to the frequency renormalisation of @xmath11 and @xmath15 phonons comes mostly from the @xmath47 points , and from the points along the diagonal respectively .",
    "this in the light of the wha gap nature would mean that the change in frequency accross the @xmath0 will be more abrupt for the @xmath11 phonon , while @xmath15 frequency change will be gradual . at lower temperatures @xmath11 frequency willi very sensitive to small doping variations near the optimal filling , decreasing as the fermi surface moves away from    in conclusion , we find that , both scaling of @xmath17 and the buckling angle with doping variation and large frequency softening of the buckling mode phonon compared to other optical modes of comparable frequencies , can be understood with the wha mechanism .    in @xmath94 compounds , it is noticed@xcite that with increase of @xmath95 concentration , the buckling(or the tilting of @xmath96 octahedra ) increases while the @xmath17 falls , i.e for the same doping concentration , the @xmath17 falls with buckling angle .",
    "it was suggested by bonesteel , rice and zhang@xcite that the charge carriers gets coupled with the buckling angle via spin orbit coupling .",
    "it was shown by bonesteel@xcite that spin orbit scattering can be a strong pair breaker provided tye material is in a structurallydisordered phase , in which the buckling distrotion is coherent on small length scale but is completely disorded on large length scales ( i.e. a spatial variation of buckling angle unlike what we have considered ) .",
    "it is possible that this series of materials have a lot of unrelaxed structural disorder .",
