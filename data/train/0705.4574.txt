    "the aim of the present work is to investigate generation of a toroidal component of the magnetic field nearby the light cylinder surface ( lcs ) ( a hypothetical surface , where the linear velocity of rotation equals the speed of light ) .    the work we consider in this paper is closely related to the pulsar wind problem . studying",
    "the magnetic field of the crab nebula , piddington ( 1953 ) was first who has suggested the presence of a central object in the nebula , with frozen magnetic field inside .",
    "it has been supposed that rotation of the central body provokes generation of the toroidal component of magnetic field .",
    "further investigations have shown that this kind of magnetic field characterizes magnetized star winds @xcite .",
    "these results have been generalized for relativistic flows in a region close to the lcs : @xcite . despite success of developed models ,",
    "they encounter a number of difficulties , when one attempts to extrapolate the wind back to the source : the pulsar magnetosphere . for large distances",
    "the wind is specified in the approximation : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the magnetic field induction , @xmath3 and @xmath4- the electron mass and density respectively and @xmath5 the lorentz factor of relativistic electrons . in this case ,",
    "change of magnetic field s configuration is defined only by plasma motion .",
    "this circumstance simplifies a possibility of analytical consideration of a plasma .",
    "but in the pulsar magnetospheres , a situation is opposite , the energy density of magnetic field exceeds by many orders of magnitude the energy density of the plasma @xmath6 , therefore a need of consideration of this specific case is essential .",
    "close to the light cylinder area the magnetic field drags behind itself the rotating electron - positron plasma and the question which arises is : how the magnetosphere is reconstructed nearby the light cylinder surface ? it is obvious that close to this region , rigid rotation is impossible and consequently magnetic field lines must deviate , lagging behind the rotation of the pulsar . implementing special mhd codes in a series of works",
    "@xcite pulsar wind physics has been numerically studied and improved by spitkovski & arons ( 2002 ) and spitkovski ( 2003 ) where plasma dynamics in 3d was presented and it has been shown that the flow goes through the lcs into the wind zone . in these papers",
    "a principal assumption is the current generated by the electric drift : @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "obviously for a plasma composed of equal numbers of positive and negative charges , the current is not generated ( the electric drift does not `` feel '' charges ) , although for the pulsar plasma a primary electron beam is composed of only electrons and therefore the electric drift generates the current , leading to creation of electromagnetic fields .    in @xcite",
    "a particle moving along a curved rotating channel has been considered and it was shown that for a certain shape of curved trajectories one may avoid the light cylinder problem . therefore one has to understand what is a mechanism responsible for the process of twisting of field lines when the condition @xmath6 is satisfied .    according to observations",
    "it is clear that the energy of emission is very high .",
    "an observed pulsar luminosity lies in the range : @xmath8erg / s$ ] @xcite , on the other hand the only source of pulsar radiation can be rotational energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is moment of inertia of the pulsar , and @xmath11 - the angular velocity of rotation .",
    "as observations show the spin down luminosity is of the same order of magnitude as the radiation luminosity , therefore it is reasonable to suppose that all pulsars emit due to rotation energy decrease @xcite .",
    "the problem concerns the question : how the rotation energy is transformed into pulsar radiation . according to standard models , due to electric field ,",
    "the charged particles uproot from a surface of the neutron star and accelerate by the electric force which results in the radiation process .",
    "the origin of this emission is supposed to be in the magnetosphere of pulsars .",
    "these models introduce a vacuum gap , inside of which the particles experience strong electric field and accelerate .",
    "but the problem arises concerning the gap size which turns out to be not enough for energy gain of charged particles @xcite .    in order to resolve this problem and enlarge the gap size ( which will provide increase of an acceleration length scale ) many attempts",
    "have been done , applying different approaches : @xcite , but no approach was able to get the efficient acceleration enough for producing observed radiation .",
    "a new mechanism of acceleration has been introduced in @xcite where a bead moving inside a straight rigidly rotating pipe has been studied .",
    "it was shown that the centrifugal force can be very efficient and if one applies this method for the pulsar magnetospheres it will provide high lorentz factors of particles .",
    "therefore the amount of energy contained within the @xmath12 plasma is very high .",
    "if one finds mechanisms for the conversion of at least a small fraction of this energy into the variety of waves or instabilities - one might witness a number of well - pronounced and bona fide observational signatures in the pulsar radiation theory .",
    "in @xcite it has been found that the radial component of velocity for relativistic particles behaves in time as @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the speed of light ) , which gives a possibility of parametric energy pumping from the mean flow into instabilities ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the @xmath12 plasma has been studied and the increment of an instability of the lengmuire waves was estimated .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the centrifugal acceleration might have been efficient enough for the observed spin down luminosity .",
    "we have shown that the linear stage was so efficient that it was very short in time , and nonlinearities were turned in soon .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the previous work and study the parametric mechanism of the curvature drift instability driven by the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "we consider a two component plasma : a ) the basic plasma flow ( bulk flow ) with the concentration @xmath15 and the lorentz factor @xmath16 and b ) the beam component with the concentration @xmath17 and the lorentz factor @xmath18 .",
    "it is known that in the pulsar magnetosphere the drift velocity is to be important for plasma dynamics .",
    "the drift velocity may influence processes in the plasma and especially may affect an evolution of instabilities . unlike @xcite where the processes are considered nearby the pulsar surface , in the present paper we investigate instabilities close to the light cylinder area , where effects of centrifugal acceleration should be extremely efficient . in @xcite it has been noted that the structure of pulsar magnetospheres could not be solved analytically , whereas in the present paper , we show that an initial stage of the reconstruction process of magnetospheres can be considered analytically , starting by appropriate initial conditions .",
    "another difference is that in our model we study a plasma , which is bound by rigidly rotating straight magnetic field and the force free condition applied in @xcite is not valid , because as it is shown in @xcite the force free condition can be provided only if the magnetic field has a configuration similar to the one of a differentially rotating couette flow .",
    "the principally different assumption in the present paper is that instead of considering the electric drift , we study the curvature drift investigating the possibility of generation of the toroidal component @xmath19 , which is a key step in understanding the reconstruction of the pulsar magnetosphere nearby the lcs .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in  [ sec : disper ] we derive the dispersion relation , in  [ sec : discus ] the corresponding results are present and in  [ sec : summary ] we summarize the results .    , @xmath20 and @xmath21 unit vectors are denoted , note that @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the curvature center . ]",
    "throughout the work it is supposed , that magnetic field lines are almost straight and due to the frozen - in condition the plasma particles follow the magnetic lines and accelerate .",
    "geometry in which we consider the problem is shown in fig .",

    "our system is governed by the euler equation @xcite :    @xmath24    @xmath25 the continuity equation : @xmath26 and the induction equation , which closes the system : @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the current of plasma and beam components .",
    "we start our analysis by introducing small deviations around the equilibrium state :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 .    since we are interested in the generation of the toroidal component of magnetic field , it is interesting to study the curvature drift wave ( when @xmath32 ) , because it is characterized by the following conditions : @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xcite that show an importance of @xmath19 on the one hand and closes the system by the second condition on the other hand .",
    "we consider the equilibrium state with a drift velocity along the @xmath35-axis    @xmath36    where @xmath5 is the lorentz factor , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field lines ( @xmath39 and @xmath3 are the charge and mass of electron and @xmath40-the magnetic induction ) . along @xmath41 , due to the centrifugal acceleration one has a relativistic flow with the velocity @xcite :    @xmath42    if one expresses the perturbation of physical quantities by following :    @xmath43 \\,,\\ ] ]    then considering only @xmath35 components of the euler and induction equation , it is easy to show that for curvature drift waves , propagating perpendicular to magnetic filed lines ( @xmath44 ) , eqs .",

    "one can see from the dispersion relation that the system is characterized by two different kinds of resonance , which come from the first and second terms of the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ res1 ] ) does not influence the corresponding resonance from the second expression , because if the first term is valid , the second condition is not satisfied and vice versa , when the second resonance works , the first one is not valid .",
    "since we are studying the mechanism of energy pumping from pulsar s rotation and a natural consequence , that magnetic field lines must be twisted nearby the light cylinder and the twist should have a direction opposite to the rotation , one can suppose that a frequency responsible for this process must be small compared the angular velocity of the pulsar . on the other hand , assuming @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 is the wave length ) for _ second _ pulsars it is straightforward to check that @xmath80 , which for any values of @xmath81 and @xmath4 is much less than @xmath82 for @xmath83 ( see eq.[res1 ] ) . thus the only possibility which provides low frequency waves from the first resonance condition is :    @xmath84    here we have assumed that @xmath85 ( @xmath86 is the pulsar radius ) . unlike this case , second resonance condition does not provide low frequencies ( see eq.([res2 ] ) ) , because even for vanishing @xmath81 and @xmath4 , @xmath87 is not vanishing and hence it does not contribute in the process of magnetic field line s twisting .",
    "let us consider the dispersion relation near the beam resonant condition expressed by eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) . then only resonant terms will be preserved and eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) will reduce :    @xmath88 @xmath89 where    @xmath90    and the frequency has been expressed by the form :    @xmath91    here @xmath92 s imaginary part @xmath93 is related to the increment of the instability . since a dominant term in eq .",
    "( [ disp1 ] ) comes from low frequencies ( @xmath94 ) , then the only terms contributed in a time average will have @xmath95 equal to @xmath96 , because all other terms with @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) give zero due to an oscillative character with very big values of frequencies .",
    "taking into account this condition , one gets :    @xmath99 @xmath100 from here one can easily express the increment by following :    @xmath101^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ]    where    @xmath102    @xmath103    strictly speaking @xmath104 and @xmath105 are functions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 and one can show , that these summations are convergent ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the increment versus following physical quantities : @xmath108 ( for the fixed , and very big in comparison with @xmath108 values of @xmath109 ) . on the other hand one",
    "has to compare results with an observational evidence .",
    "as we have already mentioned the only source that may provide energy for radiation is the slowdown of the pulsar : @xmath110 , here @xmath10 is moment of inertia of the pulsar .",
    "the rate of rotation energy loss can be estimated by following ratio : @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is rotation period of the pulsar .",
    "the given ratio is different for different pulsars and ranges from @xmath113 ( psr 0531 ) to @xmath114 ( psr 1952 + 29 )",
    ". therefore the increment of the instability must not be less than @xmath115 .",
    "we investigate the instability rate nearby the light cylinder , because the centrifugal acceleration should be most efficient in this region . in fig .",
    "[ lam ] we show dependence of the increment on : @xmath108 nearby the lcs .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and it is supposed that @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( otherwise the resonance frequency is unphysical - negative ) . here",
    "@xmath120 is the light cylinder radius .",
    "such a choise of @xmath109 provides almost perpendicular ( to the equatorial plane ) propagation of waves .",
    "one can see that the increment reaches the value @xmath121 , which is more by many orders of magnitude than typical values of @xmath115",
    ". the linear stage will be very efficient and short in time strongly indicating the non linear regime of the phenomenon . a need of non linear saturation is seen also from the fact that @xmath19 , which is responsible for twisting of magnetic field lines , oscillates with frequency @xmath122 , due to this oscillation , @xmath19 not only will lag behind the rotation , which is physically reasonable , but also will advance it , therefore the need of non linear saturation of the instability increment is essential .",
    "therefore initially created small perturbations will rapidly increase in time and thanks to the instability process , it will extract energy from the background flow into the energy of electrostatic waves .",
    "1 .   considering the relativistic plasma flow composed of the primary and secondary ( beam ) components , we have studied the role of the centrifugal acceleration in the curvature drift instability .",
    "making the linear analysis of equations , we have derived the dispersion relation and a new mechanism of the parametric instability responsible for rotation energy pumping has been found .",
    "3 .   considering low frequencies , which are responsible for twisting of magnetic field lines ,",
    "an expression for the instability increment has been obtained .",
    "studying dependence of increment on @xmath108 , it has been found that the instability was very efficient and increments were more than pulsar spin down rates by many order of magnitude indicating the need of the non linear consideration of the problem .",
    "+ as we have seen , the analysis indicated the importance of the non linear stage in dynamics of the instability , therefore it is essential to study the same problem numerically by implementing a special relativistic mhd code , which will comprise one more step closer to the real scenario .",
