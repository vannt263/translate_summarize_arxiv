    "the photogalvanic effect ( pge ) , predicted independently by @xcite for bulk semiconductors , is characteristic for gyrotropic materials and was recently intensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally , in zinc - blende and diamond - lattice quantum well ( qw ) structures @xcite . in such systems",

    "however , in the presence of a magnetic field a photocurrent can flow even if the light is unpolarized  @xcite",
    ". this will be denote as magneto - gyrotropic pge below .",

    "the magneto - gyrotropic pge occurring under linearly polarized irradiation in an applied magnetic field has been studied theoretically in bulk crystals and nanostructures  @xcite . experimentally the effect was observed in qw structures  @xcite , because the point groups @xmath4 and @xmath0 of ( 001)-grown symmetrical and asymmetrical qws belong to gyrotropic classes .",
    "so far the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent has been observed for direct optical transitions .",
    "a photocurrent caused by transitions between spin branches of the electron subband splitted due to the rashba effect has been measured in a gasb / inas single qw structure ( wavelength @xmath5 = 385 @xmath6 m or @xmath7 = 3.2 mev )  @xcite .",
    "a magnetic field induced photocurrent due to direct inter - band transitions has also been observed in gaas / algaas qws in the spectral range 0.7 @xmath6 m @xmath8 @xmath6 m and was attributed to the magnetic field induced spin - independent asymmetry of the electron dispersion in an asymmetric heterostructure  @xcite .",
    "here we report on the observation of the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent in @xmath9-doped inas qws under intra - subband absorption ( _ indirect drude - like transitions _ ) of linearly and circularly polarized far - infrared radiation ( @xmath5  =  148  @xmath6 m and @xmath5  =  90  @xmath6 m ) .",

    "the far - infrared radiation induces free carrier absorption ( drude - like ) in the lowest conduction subband @xmath231 because the photon energies are smaller than the subband separation and much larger than the @xmath24-linear spin splitting .",
    "the samples were irradiated along the growth direction by linearly or circularly polarized radiation . in all experiments",

    ", we briefly characterize all , present qualitative estimations for each and discuss which mechanism is most likely responsible for the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent observed in the samples under study . in the first mechanism",
    "the electric current appears due to an asymmetry of spin - dependent _ spin - conserving _ energy relaxation processes in a system of hot carriers heated by free carrier absorption  @xcite . due to the zeeman spin splitting of electron spin states in the magnetic field ,",
    "say @xmath143 , the difference in population of the spin branches @xmath144 is given by the ratio @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the electron @xmath146-factor , @xmath147 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath148 is the average electron energy .",
    "the light absorption leads to a non - equilibrium symmetrical distribution of electrons within each spin branch with the average energy different from that in equilibrium .",

    "thus , the ratio of antisymmetric to symmetric parts of the scattering probability rate @xmath153 is given by @xmath154 .",
    "since the antisymmetric component of the electron distribution function decays within the momentum relaxation time @xmath155 , one can write for the photocurrent @xmath156",

    "( [ 2 ] ) we took into account the balance of energy : @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",
    "the contributions to the current from electrons in the branches @xmath161 are of opposite sign .",
    "however , they do not compensate each other because of the magnetic - field induced selective occupation of the branches .",
    "the next mechanism to be considered is based on the asymmetry of spin - flip processes and represents in fact the spin - galvanic effect described by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the average electron spin and @xmath164 is its equilibrium value governed by the ratio @xmath165 .",
    "the observation of the spin - galvanic effect  @xcite was carried out under conditions where @xmath164 was negligible .",
    "then the spin - galvanic current is generated as a result of the spin relaxation which tends to depress the polarization .",
    "the same is relevant to the helicity - dependent photocurrent described by the coefficients @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "a possible contribution of the spin - galvanic effect to the polarization - independent photocurrent can be interpreted as a light - induced depolarization of the electronic spins followed by the spin relaxation tending to restore the polarization to @xmath164 . as well as in  @xcite the asymmetry of spin - flip processes",
    "can be related to the @xmath166-linear terms in the electron effective hamiltonian , @xmath167 , where the coefficients @xmath168 and @xmath169 represent the bulk- and structure - inversion asymmetry . applying the same reasons as in @xcite one can estimate the spin - galvanic contribution to the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent as @xmath170 here @xmath171 is a factor describing the depolarization of electron spin under photoexcitation followed by energy relaxation .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the time of electron energy relaxation governed mainly by electron - electron collisions , and @xmath174 is the spin relaxation time .",
    "assuming the times to be @xmath175 and @xmath176 for the room temperature , the factor @xmath171 can be estimated as @xmath177 .",
    "finally , the diamagnetic mechanism is related to spin - independent magnetic field induced @xmath166-linear terms , @xmath178 , in the electron hamiltonian , where @xmath179 and @xmath180 is the center of mass of the electron envelope function in the @xmath181-th subband @xcite . in an asymmetrical qw , @xmath182",
    "are nonzero and the subband dispersion is given by parabolas with their minima ( or maxima in case of the valence band ) shifted from the origin @xmath183 by values proportional to the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "one can show that the diamagnetic mechanism contributes to the photocurrent under indirect intra - subband optical transitions only if the indirect transition involves intermediate states in other bands or subbands , @xmath184 .",
    "then , the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent is estimated as @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a linear combination of the constants @xmath187 and @xmath188 in the subband @xmath189 and intermediate band . for intermediate states in the valence band ,",
    "the parameter @xmath190 is of the order of @xmath191 , and , for intermediate states in the next conduction subband @xmath192 , one has @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the band gap , and @xmath195 is the @xmath192-@xmath189 energy spacing .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the ratios @xmath196 and @xmath197 to be of order of @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath200 can be obtained by using the equation for @xmath169 derived in ref .",
    "it follows then that , because of the small parameters @xmath171 and @xmath190 , it is the first mechanism that is responsible for the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent induced in inas / algaas qws under indirect absorption of the far - infrared radiation .",
    "in conclusion , it has been shown that in gyrotropic systems the application of an external magnetic field induces in addition to the helicity - sensitive spin - galvanic current a light polarization independent current which we attribute to the magneto - gyrotropic effect .",
    "three different microscopic mechanisms that may contribute to this effect have been considered . under steady - state",
    "optical excitation , the role of each mechanism in the magneto - gyrotropic photocurrent is established through theoretical estimation .",
    "however , the three contributions can be separated experimentally in time - resolved measurements . indeed ,",
    "after the removal of light or under ultra - short pulsed photoexcitation the magneto - gyrotropic current should decay , for the mechanisms considered above , within the energy ( @xmath173 ) , spin ( @xmath201 ) and momentum ( @xmath155 ) relaxation times , respectively .",
