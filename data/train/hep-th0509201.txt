    "tachyonic modes are of great interest in string theory .",
    "they have been found to exist on d - brane  anti - d - brane pairs @xcite or non - bps d - branes @xcite and are related to open strings ending on these d - branes .",
    "sen conjectured that at the minimum of the tachyon potential , the negative contribution to the energy density from the tachyon potential should exactly cancel the positive contribution from the tension of the d - brane  anti - d - brane system @xcite .",
    "studies in string field theory @xcite have given good hints that this conjecture is indeed correct @xcite . in open bosonic string field theory @xcite and open superstring field theory",
    "@xcite this cancellation works with @xmath2 , respectively @xmath3 accurancy .",
    "consequently , toy models were searched for in which such computations would be easier than in the string field theory models . in @xcite",
    "a lump solution in a @xmath4-model was studied , while in @xcite a toy model was presented which provides an instability of dp - branes induced by the sphaleron of a @xmath5 ( real ) scalar field theory living in a space - time with one compactified spatial dimension . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry is broken by a higgs potential and a non - trivial sphaleron appears at the classical level if the field is considered to be periodic in one of the spatial dimensions . technically , the treatment of the fluctuations about the sphaleron is simplified by the fact that the fluctuation equation is quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) @xcite . that is to say that a finite number of the normal modes about the sphaleron can be computed explicitely .",
    "it is then possible to check the correctness of sen s conjecture by restricting the phase space to the algebraically available eigenmodes associated with the unstable solutions . applying this procedure",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that the cancellation between the negative energy from the tachyon potential and the brane tension can be nearly satisfied ( @xmath2)- even when limiting to two or three algebraic modes only .",
    "it is a natural question to investigate whether a similar result could be obtained by using more elaborated theories , like gauge theories .",
    "sphaleron solutions with a corresponding qes normal mode equation exist in the abelian higgs model as well .",
    "this model consists of a complex scalar field coupled to electromagnetism in a @xmath7 gauge - invariant way .",
    "the gauge symmetry is then broken by an appropriate higgs potential and , again , non - trivial sphaleron solutions occur at the classical level if periodicity is imposed with respect to one of the spatial dimensions .    in this paper , we apply the ideas and techniques of @xcite to the abelian higgs model . we show that - even when limiting the phase space to a single direction of instability of the sphaleron - an _ exact _ cancellation between the negative energy contribution from the tachyon potential and the brane tension is possible for specific values of the radius of the compactifying circle .",
    "in section 2 , we give the abelian higgs model in @xmath0 space - time dimensions . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the normal modes for two different values of the higgs- to gauge boson mass ratio . in section 4 , we discuss our results for the tachyon potential that we obtain for the two cases considered in section 3 .",
    "we consider the abelian higgs model in a @xmath0-dimensional space - time with topology @xmath1 .",
    "the action reads : @xmath8 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the world - volume s coordinates of a dp - brane embedded into a @xmath11 dimensional space - time and @xmath12 , @xmath13 run over these coordinates .",
    "the coordinate @xmath14 is assumed to be compactified on a circle of length @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "the complex scalar field is denoted @xmath17 and the generalized maxwell field @xmath18 .",
    "the field strength tensor , covariant derivative and potential read , respectively : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gauge coupling constant , @xmath21 the vacuum expectation value and @xmath22 the higgs self - coupling .",
    "there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry due to the @xmath23 potential which leads to a massive gauge boson with mass @xmath24 and a massive higgs boson @xmath25 .      in the following",
    "we assume the fields to be static and independent of the brane coordinates @xmath26 .",
    "we thus choose @xcite : @xmath27 @xmath28 is a real function and @xmath29 is an integer with @xmath30 representing the chern - simons charge of the solution . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "the classical equation for the field @xmath33 reads  : @xmath34 this equation admits periodic solutions which are determined in terms of the jacobi elliptic function sn@xmath35 .",
    "the solution reads  : @xmath36 where @xmath37 corresponds to a parameter with @xmath38 that fixes the period of the jacobi function .",
    "sn(@xmath39 ) has a period @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the complete elliptic function of the first kind .",
    "specific limits are given by sn@xmath42 = sin@xmath35 ( with @xmath43 ) , sn@xmath44 = tanh@xmath35 ( with @xmath45 ) .",
    "as a consequence , non - trivial solutions of ( [ kink ] ) exist only for @xmath46 .",
    "due to the periodicity of the function @xmath47 , the function @xmath48 will be periodic with period @xmath49 provided @xmath50 and the chern - simons charge @xmath30 of the solution should be of the form @xmath51 if @xmath52 is odd and @xmath53 if @xmath52 is even . note that in @xcite @xmath54 .",
    "we will see in the following that the restriction to half the period of @xcite is crucial for the cancellation between the brane tension and the negative energy from the tachyon potential .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the lowest energy configuration ( the `` sphaleron '' ) corresponds to @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the sphaleron solution ( [ solution ] ) represents the energy barrier between vacua of different topological charges .",
    "its energy reads : @xmath57   \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath58 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath37 : for @xmath59 we have @xmath60 , while for @xmath61 : @xmath62 .",
    "in order to determine the tachyon potential , we first have to perform the normal mode analysis of the sphaleron solution given above . in the following ,",
    "we use the notations of @xcite  : @xmath63 @xmath64 where the functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 are periodic with respect to @xmath67 on @xmath68 $ ] , while the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 are periodic , respectively anti - periodic with respect to @xmath67 if @xmath29 is even and @xmath29 is odd .",
    "we fix the gauge degree of freedom by choosing the background gauge condition : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    expanding the classical action in powers of the fluctuations @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and using the gauge fixing condition leads to the following expression for the action  :    @xmath74\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the quadractic term @xmath75 has the form  : @xmath76\\eta_1     + \\sum_{\\mu } a_{\\mu } ( \\partial_z^2 - \\theta ^2\\phi^2 ) a_{\\mu }     + \\left(\\matrix{a_z \\",

    "the `` interaction term '' @xmath78 reads  : @xmath79    the @xmath80-integral of the first two terms in ( [ expansion ] ) is the negative of the ( rescaled ) energy @xmath81 of the sphaleron solution ( compare ( [ energy ] ) ) and is equal to the dp - brane tension @xmath82 .",
    "we use the following normal mode expansion : @xmath83 and @xmath84 the fields @xmath85 and @xmath86 live on the dp - brane world volume and satisfy the equations @xmath87 while the expressions for the fields @xmath88 and @xmath89 lead to the following system of schrdinger - like equations  : @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 equation ( [ lame1 ] ) above is a lam equation and admits five explicit eigenvalues . the equations ( [ lame2 ] ) and ( [ system ] ) do not admit explicit solutions for generic values of mass ratio @xmath93 .",
    "however if this mass ratio is of the form @xmath94 ( with @xmath13 being an integer ) then ( [ lame2 ] ) is a lam equation admitting @xmath95 explicit solutions ( for each value of the index @xmath96 ) and the coupled equation ( [ system ] ) admits @xmath97 explicit solutions ( for @xmath98 ) @xcite .    in the following",
