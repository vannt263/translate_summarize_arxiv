    "today it is commonplace to undertake highly multiple hypothesis testing , generally in genomics and very often using tests based on student s @xmath0-statistic ; see , for example , benjamini and yekutieli ( @xcite ) , efron and tibshirani ( @xcite ) , cui and churchill ( @xcite ) , amaratunga and cabrera ( @xcite ) , page  114 , scheid and spang ( @xcite ) , shaffer ( @xcite ) , fox and dimmic ( @xcite ) , hu and willsky ( @xcite ) , qiu and yakovlev ( @xcite ) , efron ( @xcite ) , liu and hwang ( @xcite ) and van de wiel and kim ( @xcite ) .",
    "this popularity of multiple @xmath0-testing also extends to other fields ( e.g. , pawluk - koc _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the principal methods used to control the family - wise error rate and false discovery rate are founded on the assumption of independence among tests .",
    "alternative approaches are generally based either on bonferroni bounds , which are unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons ( see , e.g. , perneger ( @xcite ) ) , or on the hope that , despite ample evidence of non - independence in terms of correlation analysis , independence can be assumed in practice .",
    "the latter hope tends to be pinned either on work of benjamini and yekutieli ( @xcite ) , who argued that in some settings , the absence of independence can give conservative results , or on experience with the analysis of financial data , which suggests that in some circumstances , it might be reasonable to assume that the upper tails of the test statistics are independent , even if the joint distributions are not .",
    "upper tail independence , as it is sometimes called ( for discussion , see , e.g. , wu ( @xcite ) , falk and reiss ( @xcite ) , r.  schmidt ( @xcite ) , li ( @xcite ) , r.  schmidt and stadtmller ( @xcite ) , t.  schmidt ( @xcite ) ) , is generally assumed to be non - asymptotic in nature .",
    "that is , tails of joint distributions are often taken to be perfectly independent beyond a certain threshold .",
    "however , this type of model is not really appropriate for the analysis of genomic data . in particular",
    ", it is difficult to determine a biological reason for , or the actual location of , a threshold .",
    "it is of greater practical interest to consider the possibility that the strength of dependence in upper tails could become successively weaker as the number of simultaneous tests , and the number of data vectors , increases .",
    "if this could be established in the context of tests based on student s @xmath0-statistic , it would lend immediate justification to the often - made assumption ( see the articles cited in the first paragraph of this paper ) that highly multiple @xmath0-statistics can be taken to be independent .",
    "the present paper will establish such a result .",
    "the mechanism for our model involves the critical points for tests becoming more extreme as the number , @xmath1 , of tests diverges ( in fact , the increase in critical points is a direct consequence of @xmath1 diverging ) so that the tests are conducted further into the tails ; furthermore , the tails of the distributions of test statistics becoming successively lighter as the number of degrees of freedom of the test statistics increases .",
    "we impose particularly weak conditions on the marginal distributions of components .",
    "in particular , the distributions need only three finite moments . with this assumption , and permitting the size , @xmath2 , of the group sample to increase a little faster than the logarithm of the number of tests , it follows from our results that the joint distributions of test statistics enjoy an asymptotic form of the upper tail independence property",
    ".    this result would not be so striking if the statistics had normal distributions , but it fails for heavy - tailed distributions such as those for which not all moments are finite .",
    "of course , student s @xmath0-distribution is itself in this category , yet our results show that asymptotic independence holds in a particularly strong sense for student s @xmath0-statistic , even if it is computed from relatively heavy - tailed data .",
    "the reason this is possible is that we permit the group sample size to increase at a rate that is just sufficient to convert heavy tails to tails that are sufficiently light , to enable approximate independence at high levels .",
    "it can be seen from this property that the availability of upper - tail asymptotic independence is a bonus of working with highly multiple hypothesis testing , that is ,  with `` large @xmath1 and small @xmath2 '' problems .",
    "it is not available in more conventional , `` small @xmath1 and large @xmath2 '' problems , where there is a very large literature on modelling dependence in highly multiple hypothesis testing .",
    "there is a literature on comparing studentized means when the variances used for studentizing are computed from pooled data and so are common to each test statistic .",
    "however , in our experience , that approach is used less frequently , in practice , than the `` local '' standardization treated in the present paper .",
    "when using the latter method , each mean is divided by the standard deviation of the sample from which it was computed .",
    "a major motivation is that the true variances may be different in each instance . even if the variances can reasonably be assumed to be the same , it can be desirable to use the local approach since it confers greater robustness .",
    "for example , when applied to the mean alone , rather than its locally studentized form , the large - deviation properties that underpin the analysis of high - level exceedences require the data to have lighter tails .",
    "statistical literature on highly multiple hypothesis testing is outlined in helpful reviews by hochberg and tamhane ( @xcite ) , pigeot ( @xcite ) , dudoit _ et al . _  ( @xcite ) , bernhard _ et al . _  ( @xcite ) and lehmann and romano ( @xcite ) , chapter 9 .",
    "benjamini and hochberg ( @xcite ) introduced an approach , which has become very popular , to the controlling of false discovery rates ; see also simes ( @xcite ) , hommel ( @xcite ) , hochberg ( @xcite ) , sarkar and chang ( @xcite ) , sarkar ( @xcite ) , sen ( @xcite ) , hochberg and benjamini ( @xcite ) and lehmann _ et al . _  ( @xcite ) .",
    "benjamini and yekutieli ( @xcite ) specified conditions under which simultaneous , dependent hypothesis tests , conducted as though they were independent , give conservative results ; benjamini and yekutieli ( @xcite ) addressed similar issues in the context of false coverage - statement rate .",
    "sarkar ( @xcite ) extended the work of benjamini and yekutieli  ( @xcite ) .",
    "efron ( @xcite ) suggested correlation corrections for large - scale simultaneous hypothesis testing .",
    "et al . _  ( @xcite ) proposed methods for controlling family - wise error rates in multiple procedures , holland and cheung ( @xcite ) discussed robustness of family - wise error rates and clarke and hall ( @xcite ) discussed robustness of testing procedures based on means .",
    "given @xmath3 , assume that for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we observe data @xmath6 , which we use to construct @xmath0-statistics @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in practice ,",
    "the statistic @xmath10 is used to test the hypothesis that the @xmath11th group has zero mean , against a one - sided alternative . when controlling the level of family - wise error rate ( fwer ) for step - down tests , we require the values of probabilities @xmath12 for @xmath13 for different levels @xmath0 and different subsets @xmath14 of @xmath15 .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] below will enable us to compute these through approximation by the case where the @xmath10 s are all independent ; see section  [ sec2.3 ] for further details .",
    "we standardize @xmath16 by dividing by @xmath2 , rather than @xmath17 , since the former is more common in nonparametric problems , but the results below are unaffected by this issue . since we studentize , there is no loss of generality in assuming that the variance of each component equals  1 .",
    "more particularly , we ask that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a sequence of constants .",
    "the assumption that @xmath20 is made here because , in the great majority of practical applications , the hypothesis alternative to the null entails the zero level being exceeded .",
    "accordingly , the tests are one - sided , hence our preoccupation with exceedences of a level .",
    "however , minor modifications of our arguments permit the two - sided case to be treated .",
    "further , we assume that for an integer @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 . the third moment condition in ( [ eq2.1 ] ) permits the variables @xmath6 to have relatively heavy - tailed distributions , for example , a pareto distribution with tail exponent greater than  3 .",
    "the assumption of short - range correlation in ( [ eq2.2 ] ) is , of course , an oversimplification , but it reflects the low level of correlation that is often observed in practice .",
    "for example , messer and arndt ( @xcite ) argue that correlation decays from about 0.08 , at a separation of approximately two base pairs , to about @xmath24 for a separation of ten base pairs .",
    "results reported by mansilla _",
    "et al . _  ( @xcite ) corroborate these figures if we assume that their data are normally distributed .",
    "more generally , almirantis and provata ( @xcite ) give evidence of both short - range and long - range correlation , depending on the nature of the dna or rna under investigation .",
    "the relationship between the group size , @xmath2 , and the number of hypothesis tests , @xmath1 , is assumed to satisfy @xmath25 this allows the group size to be very much smaller than the number of tests . in the absence of more detailed assumptions about the distributions of the @xmath6 s , ( [ eq2.3 ] ) is necessary for the theorem we shall give below . to appreciate why , note that if the @xmath6 s are independent and identically distributed with an atom at zero and , in particular , if @xmath26 , then , with probability at least @xmath27 , the @xmath0-statistic @xmath28 assumes the indeterminate value  @xmath29 . in such cases , we shall take @xmath30 , but in order for the theorem to have a meaningful interpretation when @xmath0 is the @xmath31-level quantile of the standard normal distribution , it is essential that the probability that @xmath32 be of smaller order than  @xmath33",
    ". therefore , we require @xmath34 for all @xmath35 and this assumption is equivalent to  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) .    define @xmath36 and @xmath37 . condition ( [ eq2.2 ] ) implies that @xmath38 and , of course , @xmath39 .",
    "given @xmath40 , let @xmath41 satisfy @xmath42 where @xmath19 are as in  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) . if @xmath0 satisfies the first part of ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , then any function @xmath43 which satisfies , as @xmath44 , @xmath45 converges to zero as @xmath46 . in the arguments in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we shall use this notation generically ; while @xmath43 will satisfy ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , it will alter from one appearance to another . strictly speaking , it is not essential to take @xmath1 to diverge . although that condition motivates the assumption of divergent @xmath0 and is , in turn , motivated by the contemporary high - dimensional problems that led to this work , it is not necessary for the theorem below .",
    "[ thm1 ] if @xmath47@xmath48 hold , then there exists a probability space on which are defined random variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that  the joint distribution of @xmath51 is identical to that of @xmath52 ;  the random variables @xmath50 are independent and distributed , respectively , as @xmath52 ; and  with probability equal to @xmath53 , the exceedences of @xmath0 by @xmath54 occur at the same indices and take the same values as the exceedences of @xmath0 by @xmath50 .    to interpret the theorem , note that we would normally expect the dependent data set @xmath52 to exhibit clusters of level exceedences , rather than the single , isolated exceedences associated with the independent sequence @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath10 process ( or , equivalently , the @xmath55 process ) behaves like the @xmath56 process in the case of large exceedences reflects the fact that , since the marginal distribution of a @xmath0-statistic is relatively light - tailed ( if @xmath2 is sufficiently large  see ( [ eq2.3 ] ) ) , exceedences of a high level are rare and so are unlikely to occur together .",
    "the case of low - level exceedences is a very different matter , of course , and so we would expect the theorem to fail if the lower bound for @xmath0 , in the first part of ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , were relaxed too far .      in this section ,",
    "we treat the case of the null hypothesis , where @xmath57 for each  @xmath11 .",
    "this would be assumed in most applications of theorem  [ thm1 ] since it represents the setting that is conventionally used for calibration .",
    "the theorem implies that , in a strong sense , exceedences down to those of the level @xmath58 are identical to the ones that would occur in the case of independent tests .",
    "now , the probability associated with an exceedence of @xmath59 is , for small @xmath60 , approximately  @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , false discoveries at probability levels of approximately @xmath61 , and at lower levels , can be adequately controlled by assuming that the tests are independent , even when they are not .",
    "note that @xmath62 and that the false - discovery level controlled by the conventional family - wise error rate is only  @xmath33 .",
    "next , we discuss the sorts of calculations that are enabled by theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the number of indices @xmath64 $ ] for which @xmath10 lies in the interval @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is determined by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 held fixed .",
    "( we take @xmath70 . ) if @xmath52 were fixed , then the joint distribution of the @xmath71 random variables @xmath72 would be exactly multinomial with parameters @xmath1 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74)$ ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] implies that for the dependent process @xmath52 , and for any @xmath75 for which @xmath76 satisfies ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , any simultaneous probability calculation based on the multinomial result , but applied to the actual @xmath77 process rather than an idealized process with independent marginals , is valid , provided that @xmath78 and the final computed probability is quantified by adding an error which is stated to be of order @xmath79 .",
    "the latter probability converges to zero , even if @xmath80 is taken as large as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .    from this point ,",
    "simultaneous multinomial probability calculations based on @xmath83 , familiar from the well - understood case of independent test statistics , can be used to construct rules for controlling fwer or false discovery rate  ( fdr ) ; see , for example , benjamini and hochberg  ( @xcite ) .",
    "wang and hall ( @xcite ) have shown that , under the assumption of finite third moments , highly accurate approximations are available for the marginal distribution of  @xmath28 . such calculations , which justify standard normal , student s @xmath0- or bootstrap approximations to the marginal distribution of @xmath28 , are already widely used in practice ( see section  [ sec1 ] ) , in conjunction with the independence assumption , when controlling false discovery rates .",
    "our paper provides justification for these methods .",
    "more generally , theorem  [ thm1 ] implies that if a probability statement about what the process @xmath52 does above the level @xmath0 is founded on the assumption of independence , then , no matter how complex or convoluted the statement might be , the claimed probability level is accurate to within  @xmath84 .    to give an example of calculations based on theorem  [ thm1 ] , take @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the latter denoting the upper @xmath88-level quantile of student s @xmath0-distribution with @xmath89 degrees of freedom . reflecting empirical evidence given in section  [ sec2.1 ] , take @xmath90 .",
    "then , ( [ eq2.5 ] ) is in order ; the probability that at least one value of @xmath1 independent @xmath0 statistics , each on 99 degrees of freedom , exceeds @xmath87 equals @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively ; and ( [ eq2.6 ] ) suggests that the errors in these levels are in error by less than @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "most likely , the errors are much less than these since the asymptotic bound is derived only as an upper bound .",
    "if we were to make a general probability statement about exceedences of the level @xmath100 by the stochastic process of @xmath0 statistics , under the assumption of independence , then , despite the process actually being @xmath101-dependent rather than independent , we would expect to make errors no greater than these respective values . in the same general setting ,",
    "relative error decreases to zero as @xmath1 and @xmath0 increase .",
    "for example , in cases where @xmath0 solves @xmath102 , with @xmath103 denoting the standard normal distribution function , we have @xmath104\\to 0 $ ] as @xmath44 .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] can be extended to other settings , in particular , to those where ( a )  a wider range of dependence , obtained by allowing @xmath101 in ( [ eq2.2 ] ) to diverge with @xmath1 , is allowed ; ( b )  the value of @xmath2 for the @xmath11th group equals @xmath105 , depending on @xmath11 , and ( [ eq2.3 ] ) is altered by requiring that @xmath106 ; ( c )  weights @xmath107 are incorporated into the construction of the @xmath0-statistics @xmath10 , by defining @xmath108 , @xmath109 and , as before , @xmath110 .",
    "provided the weights satisfy @xmath111 where @xmath112 are positive constants not depending on @xmath1 , the proof in this more general case is as in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "however , the statement of the theorem is then less elegant and less transparent , so we do not give the more general version here .",
    "incorporation of the weights @xmath107 permits the scope of the example above to be extended to hypothesis - testing problems involving linear regression.=1    to indicate the types of results that can be achieved under longer ranges of dependence , we shall discuss the case of a moving average , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is permitted to diverge to infinity at a rate not exceeding @xmath115 and the independent disturbances @xmath116 are all distributed as @xmath117 , for which @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in this setting , ( [ eq2.2 ] ) holds .",
    "we strengthen ( [ eq2.3 ] ) by asking that @xmath120 . the definition of @xmath0 implicit in  ( [ eq2.5 ] )",
    "can now be refined to @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes a sufficiently large absolute constant .",
