    "it is estimated that some @xmath4 galactic open clusters ( ocs ) should exist in the milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , recent oc catalogs @xcite list only a few thousands entries , mainly within 1  kpc .",
    "the discrepancy is due partly to the dust extinction in the galactic plane , and partly to lack of comprehensive all - sky searches .",
    "`` star counting '' is an efficient algorithm to identify star density enhancement on a wide - field or an all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "several existing all - sky survey databases can be used to identify star density enhancements as oc candidates .",
    "for instance , the 2mass point - source catalog @xcite provides a uniformly calibrated database of the entire sky .",
    "furthermore , infrared observations allow us to recognize ocs even with moderate dust extinction , i.e. , partially embedded , young star clusters .",
    "recent work by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have indeed found hundreds of previously unknown infrared clusters with 2mass , some of which turn out to be bona fide stellar groups as verified by follow - up photometric studies .",
    "here we report the results of our searching algorithm and preliminary characterization of star clusters from 2mass data .",
    "the analyzed sky coverage was between galactic latitude @xmath0 .",
    "we divided the sky into @xmath5 fields and selected 2mass stars with s / n@xmath6 in all jhks bands .",
    "each field was analyzed by counting the number of stars in a grid , whose size was chosen to include an average of 10 stars .",
    "the same field then would be analyzed again by shifting half a grid size .",
    "the resulting density distribution was then smoothed with a @xmath7 box .",
    "the background density was estimated by @xmath8 clipping of outliers .",
    "any grid in the smoothed density map above @xmath9 background was considered to be a high density grid and a group of more than three adjacent high density grids would be identified as a high density group ( hdg ) .",
    "our analysis resulted in a total of 720 hdgs . using the simbad database",
    ", we matched the hdgs within a radius of @xmath10 with 668 known objects , including 474 ocs , 89 globular clusters , 35 galaxies , 55 galaxy clusters , 11 h  ii regions , and 4 regions contaminated by nearby bright stars .",
    "a total of 52 hdgs remain unaccounted for .",
    "these are our oc candidates . in figure",
    "[ sample ] , we demonstrate such a case , hdg01 at @xmath1 , located near the galactic plane",
    ".    demonstration of a high density group , hdg01 .",
    "the contour marks the the 3@xmath11 level above the sky density .",
    "known ocs ( in green circles ) are from @xcite version 3.0 .",
    "note that @xcite and @xcite catalogs were not found in this fov .",
    "each black plus represents a high density grid and a blue circle marks a hdg . ]",
    "figure  [ all ] shows our analysis of hdg01 in fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "the radial density profile suggested a field density of @xmath12  stars per square arcmin , and a density enhancement within @xmath2 .",
    "the central density in the cluster region reaches @xmath13  stars per square arcmin , and there are a total of 51 candidate member stars within the @xmath2 cluster radius .    the age and distance of ndg01 are derived by fitting padova 2mass photometric isochrones with solar metallicity .",
    "the best fit , as judged by eye , gives a distance of @xmath14  kpc . at this distance",
    ", the cluster s apparent angular radius of @xmath2 corresponds to a physical radius of 3.7  pc . with no kinematic information , particularly for giant stars to constrain the isochrone , the age of hdg01 is very uncertain . due to some nebulous shape around this region",
    ", it should have an young - age , less then 10  myr .",
    "we have developed a star counting algorithm and tested it on the 2mass star catalog to search for candidate star clusters . within the galactic latitude @xmath0 ,",
    "some 80% overdensity regions are associated with known star clusters , or other objects ( galaxies or clusters of galacies ) , and a total of 52 uncharted cluster candidates have been found .",
    "here we present one such candidate , hdg01 at @xmath1 , with nearly 80 member candidates with an angular radius of @xmath2 , and at a heliocentric distance of 1.8  kpc .",
    "the full analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our algorithm will be applied to other sky survey catalogs such as the pan - starrs , which reaches much fainter brightness limits ( 2223 mag in r@xmath15 ) than those of 2mass .",
    "we expect to enlarge the known oc sample to a much larger space volume in the solar neighborhood and down to significantly lower stellar mass than data currently available . in the third and fourth quadrants ,",
    "in particular , where the extinction is relatively low , we will be able to explore the entire milky way disk , thereby providing a comprehensive sample of ocs to probe the formation and evolutionary history of the galactic disks .",
