    "cosmological models are expected to explain the large scale properties of the early universe : the homogeneity , flatness and isotropy of the background , and the nearly scale - invariant spectrum of the primordial perturbations .",
    "these conditions can be achieved in either a rapidly expanding ( inflationary ) phase right after the big bang @xcite or a slow contracting ( ekpyrotic ) phase preceding the big bang @xcite . in order to have the latter scenario",
    ", however , the universe has to undergo a bounce from the contracting phase to an expanding phase .",
    "this transition imposes an extra condition on cosmological models , namely , the desired properties of the large scale structure created in the contracting phase must be propagated safely through the bounce .",
    "the bounce may be induced by quantum gravity effects when the scale factor shrinks to the planck scale near a classical singularity @xcite .",
    "although theories of such a quantum bounce ( also referred to as a `` singular '' bounce ) are not fully developed , it is conjectured that the homogeneity and the scale - invariance conditions generated before the bounce should pass smoothly through the bounce @xcite .",
    "the intuition is that the low energy physics that generates structure on large length scales should decouple from the physics at high energies and short lengths that is responsible for the bounce .",
    "an alternative approach that has been pursued in recent years is to realize the bounce in a classically nonsingular way @xcite . in this approach",
    "the universe stops contraction and reverses to expansion at a finite value of the scale factor @xmath2 , when classical gravity and effective field theories are still valid .",
    "the intended advantage is that it becomes possible to describe with known theories the entire evolution of the cosmological background and the conditions that emerge from the bounce . to have a nonsingular bounce",
    "requires violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "a commonly used approach is to introduce a scalar field that undergoes _ ghost condensation _",
    "the period during which the nec is violated will be referred to as the _ bouncing phase_.    some earlier studies @xcite of nonsingular bounces have not included an ekpyrotic phase . in those cases ,",
    "the contracting universe is unstable to the growth of anisotropies unless one assumes extreme fine - tuning of initial conditions ; it is also difficult to produce a sufficiently wide spectrum of scale - invariant fluctuations .",
    "moreover , some earlier treatments @xcite of the bouncing phase only consider the last stage when the hubble parameter @xmath3 varies linearly with time and passes through zero .",
    "this period does not cover the whole bouncing phase during which nec is violated , leaving out important problems that arise in earlier stages of the bouncing phase .    in this paper , we consider nonsingular bouncing cosmologies that have an ekpyrotic phase prior to the bouncing phase .",
    "the ekpyrotic phase stably smooths and flattens the universe , and leads to the generation of nearly scale - invariant perturbations .",
    "after the ekpyrotic phase , ghost condensation is triggered to bring the universe into a bouncing phase with @xmath1 that violates the nec .",
    "we consider the entire bouncing phase from the start of nec violation at @xmath4 to the nonsingular bounce at @xmath5 .",
    "we examine perturbations around the background evolution and identify problems that break the homogeneity , isotropy and scale - invariance conditions .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we argued that the bouncing phase strongly modifies the spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "an adiabatic mode , though decaying and negligible during the ekpyrotic phase , was shown to grow exponentially just before the bouncing phase when the equation of state @xmath6 crosses @xmath7 . by the time the universe bounces ,",
    "the total curvature perturbation becomes dominated by this adiabatic mode , which unfortunately carries a blue spectrum that is inconsistent with cosmological observations .",
    "this result does not depend on how the scale - invariant mode is generated in the ekpyrotic phase .",
    "to further elaborate this idea , we will show that our conclusion does not change with different gauge choices , hence posing a serious physical problem for nonsingular bouncing models .",
    "in addition , we will demonstrate a new effect that significantly amplifies the anisotropy .",
    "this amplification occurs gradually through the entire bouncing phase , and is not noticed in previous analyses that focused only on the last stage of the bounce when @xmath3 increases linearly with time . in our analysis",
    ", we find that the scale factor has to decrease exponentially during the entire bouncing phase , causing the anisotropy to grow substantially before the bounce .",
    "consequently , the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe achieved in the preceding ekpyrotic phase are lost .",
    "here we consider both anisotropies that have classical and quantum origins .",
    "the classical anisotropy , present at the beginning of the ekpyrotic phase , generally comes to dominate over the ghost condensate field before the bounce , unless it is tuned to a sufficiently small value even before the ekpyrotic phase begins .",
    "a more serious issue is the anisotropy induced by quantum fluctuations , whose amplitude is linked to the amplitude of curvature perturbations .",
    "this quantum generated anisotropy is negligible during the ekpyrotic phase , but becomes overwhelmingly large in the bouncing phase . as a result ,",
    "the universe is inevitably led to chaotic mixmaster behavior and contracts to a singularity , @xmath8 ; that is , the nonsingular bounce is totally disrupted .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we present a sample model that incorporates the generic features of an ekpyrotic phase and a nonsingular bouncing phase .",
    "the bouncing phase is described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : bounce ] . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : curvature ] , we demonstrate the dramatic growth of curvature perturbation that alters the power spectrum , presenting our analysis in both the comoving and the synchronous gauges . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropy ] , we analyze the evolution of the anisotropy , showing how it is induced by the curvature perturbation and how it disrupts the nonsingular bounce . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we argue that both problems of curvature and anisotropy can be attributed to the exponential difference between the low energy scale of ghost condensation and the high energy scale of the ekpyrotic phase .",
    "in this section , we introduce a generic nonsingular bouncing cosmology that we will use for our study . previous analyses of nonsingular bouncing models can be divided into those with an ekpyrotic contraction phase with equation of state @xmath9 and those in which the contraction phase has @xmath6 strictly @xmath10 . without an ekpyrotic phase , the contraction is unstable to the growth of anisotropy and the onset of chaotic mixmaster oscillations @xcite . to counter the instability , extreme fine - tuning of initial conditions",
    "must be imposed , or the unstable contracting phase must be made so short that it is insufficient to explain the large scale uniformity and density perturbations observed today . for these reasons ,",
    "the only cases of interest are those with a long ekpyrotic contraction phase with @xmath9 , followed by a transition to a bouncing phase with @xmath1 .",
    "the transition is hard to achieve by combining two independent components with @xmath9 and @xmath1 respectively , because if the @xmath9 component dominates during the ekpyrotic phase , then the @xmath1 component would grow much more slowly and never come to dominate during the bouncing phase .",
    "a more economical approach is to have a single component whose equation of state @xmath6 switches from @xmath11 to @xmath12 between the ekpyrotic and the bouncing phase .",
    "this scenario is achieved naturally by having a scalar field that rolls down a steep negative potential during the ekpyrotic phase , and then undergoes ghost condensation after the ekpyrotic phase is over . in this way the entire contracting and bouncing history of the universe is driven by the same field .",

    "then we can focus on problems of growing curvature and anisotropy that arise regardless of the gravitational instability .",
    "before studying the evolution of perturbations , a more detailed description of the bouncing phase is needed .",

    "the hubble parameter @xmath3 is negative and exponentially large , so there must be a long period with @xmath48 in order for @xmath3 to increase to zero .    to determine how long the bouncing phase really lasts , we solve the equation of motion for the scalar field , @xmath71 using ( [ eq : pxx ] ) , a general solution to eq .",

    "we are now in a position to solve the equation @xmath80 the solution can be described in three stages according to whether the friction or the gradient term dominates",

    "next , the negative kinetic energy @xmath82 increases and the friction term overtakes the gradient . finally , very close to the bounce we have @xmath83 but @xmath84 becomes small , so that the friction term is again subdominant to the gradient term . among these three stages ,",
    "the first and the last are both very short and do not contain interesting features . indeed ,",
    "since the friction and the gradient terms have the same sign during the bouncing phase , we have @xmath85 until @xmath86 , which lasts less than a hubble time , @xmath87 hence the scale factor does not change much , @xmath88 . similarly , the third stage begins from @xmath89 , and the time it takes to reach the bounce can be bounded by @xmath90 which is much less than a hubble time , implying @xmath91 .",
    "finite factors like @xmath92 and @xmath93 are neglected in these estimates .",

    "that is , the anisotropy has returned !    to be more precise , during the ekpyrotic phase the suppression of anisotropy happens in such a way that the anisotropy term itself remains almost constant , while the scalar field energy increases by an exponential factor @xmath22 . in the bouncing phase",
    ", however , the anisotropy term grows by the same factor @xmath22 , while the scalar field energy decreases rapidly towards @xmath110 .",
    "thus there must be a point near the end of the bouncing phase where the anisotropy contribution to the friedmann equation ( [ eq : friedmann1 ] ) overtakes the scalar field energy .",
    "after this point , the nonsingular bouncing solution ( [ eq : bounceh ] ) that assumes the dominance of the scalar field becomes invalid . to see how the exponential growth of anisotropy may disrupt the nonsingular bounce , we need to study perturbations around the background evolution found above .",

    "the evolution of the curvature perturbation involves only the scalar perturbations . to agree with observations ,",
    "the contracting phase of the universe has to generate a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed that can give rise to such scale - invariant curvature perturbation , including the multi - field entropic mechanism @xcite and the single - field adiabatic ekpyrotic mechanism @xcite .",
    "once the generated scale - invariant mode exits the horizon , it is expected to be conserved on superhorizon scales .",
    "meanwhile , there exists an adiabatic contribution to the curvature perturbation that is time - varying according to the equation of state .",
    "this adiabatic contribution generally has a blue spectrum , and is subdominant to the constant scale - invariant modes on large scales .",
    "however , a serious problem arises when the equation of state @xmath6 abruptly changes in the transition from the ekpyrotic phase to the bouncing phase .",
    "it happens that an adiabatic mode grows exponentially as @xmath6 drops past @xmath7 , and surpasses the scale - invariant mode even on large scales .    to observe this problem , consider the curvature perturbation in the comoving gauge defined by @xmath130 , as is done in @xcite .",

    "finally , let us take care of the gravitational instability in the bouncing phase when @xmath200 . during the bouncing phase , perturbation modes may reenter the horizon .",
    "for example , in the case of a slowly varying @xmath201 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath202 ) consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : pxx ] ) , the freeze - out horizon scale corresponding to the bouncing solution ( [ eq : bounceh ] ) and ( [ eq : bouncea ] ) is given by @xmath203 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which goes from negative to positive and crosses zero at @xmath204 .",
    "therefore all modes briefly reenter the horizon around this time , and exit again when @xmath205 approaching the bounce . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , modes inside the horizon grow unstable instead of undergoing oscillations . since the growth rate is proportional to @xmath206 , this instability could be tamed if @xmath207 is small and the duration inside the horizon is short .",
    "the dangerous modes are those on small scales , which reenter the horizon early in the bouncing phase and stay inside until very close to the bounce .",
    "their duration inside the horizon can approach the upper bound ( [ eq : duration ] ) , or in conformal time , @xmath208 which may create a problem for the modes with @xmath209 . to avoid this gravitational instability , the speed of sound has to be @xmath210 ) dominates the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rexpansion ] ) and our computations follow .",
    "we note that even when gravitational instability is suppressed under the condition ( [ eq : cs2cond ] ) , the problem with the exponential growth of the comoving curvature perturbation still occurs just before @xmath201 becomes negative .",
    "having traced the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation through each stage of the contracting phase , let us now comment on the curvature perturbation in other gauges",
    ". under a general coordinate transformation @xmath211 , the curvature perturbation @xmath118 transforms as ( appendix ( [ eq : psi_transf ] ) ) @xmath212 an immediate consequence is that the curvature perturbation is gauge - invariant at a nonsingular bounce where @xmath5 ; hence results computed in different gauges must agree as they approach the bounce .",
    "therefore the exponential growth of curvature perturbation that we found in the comoving gauge is truly physical and should exist in other gauges as well .",
    "however , although the curvature perturbation in different gauges end up with the same value at the bounce , their patterns of growth can be quite different during the contracting phase before the bounce .",
    "for example , in the longitudinal gauge ( appendix  [ sec : perturbation ] ) the newtonian potential @xmath213 grows exponentially during the ekpyrotic phase , but undergoes no abrupt change in the transitional kinetic phase , then grows further in the bouncing phase to reach the same value as @xmath198 at the bounce . in the above computations , we chose to study the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath198 because it will be conserved outside the horizon in the expanding phase including the reheating period , and therefore it is directly related to the density and temperature fluctuations that are observed today .",
    "it is also a convenient variable to study because it is almost conserved during both the ekpyrotic and the bouncing phases , whereas the exponential growth can be clearly confined and ascribed to the transition between the two phases , during which the equation of state @xmath6 changes rapidly .",
    "since the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath198 becomes exponentially large right before the bouncing phase , another natural concern is whether the perturbative computation breaks down at this point .",
    "we address this question by noting that the perturbation theory is valid if there exists one particular gauge in which the perturbations of all relevant physical quantities remain small ; then the variables in other gauges can be formally defined and related to the quantities in this particular gauge through gauge transformations . in our case , the synchronous gauge plays this role .",
    "it can be readily checked that the physical quantities , including the curvature perturbation @xmath214 , the shear perturbation @xmath215 ( see section  [ sec : anisotropy ] ) , and the matter perturbations @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , all remain finite during the transitional kinetic phase in this gauge . in particular ,",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath214 in the synchronous gauge can be related to @xmath198 through ( appendix ( [ eq : r - to - psi_s ] ) ) @xmath219 after the @xmath133 mode @xmath220 exits horizon , we may insert the leading terms of @xmath132 from ( [ eq : r0 ] ) to find ( for brevity we will omit the subscript @xmath133 from here on ) @xmath221 due to the presence of @xmath174 in the outer integral , the second term remains small when @xmath222 , so that the curvature perturbation is well behaved in this gauge when the equation of state @xmath6 crosses @xmath7 .",
    "hence it is indeed legitimate to carry our computations beyond this point into the bouncing phase .    nevertheless , even the synchronous curvature perturbation @xmath214 has to grow exponentially near the bounce to match the value of @xmath198 . to prove this ,",
    "let us evaluate eq .",

    "we would like to determine if , after exponential amplification in the bouncing phase , it may dominate the energy density and prevent the nonsingular bounce .",
    "for this purpose , we shall include the anisotropy term in the friedmann equations and reanalyze the bouncing behavior of the universe . under the approximations ( [ eq : approxt ] ) and ( [ eq : approxv ] ) , the friedmann equations become @xmath263 in order to reach a nonsingular bounce in the presence of a nonzero @xmath44 , @xmath264 must decrease to a negative value to cancel the @xmath44 in ( [ eq : friedmann1new ] ) .",

    "<S> we consider bouncing cosmologies in which an ekpyrotic contraction phase with @xmath0 is followed by a bouncing phase with @xmath1 that violates the null energy condition . </S>",
    "<S> the bouncing phase , induced by ghost condensation , is designed to produce a classically nonsingular bounce at a finite value of the scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the initial curvature and anisotropy , though diluted during the ekpyrotic phase , grow back exponentially during the bouncing phase . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , curvature perturbations and anisotropy are generated by quantum fluctuations during the ekpyrotic phase . in the bouncing phase </S>",
    "<S> , however , an adiabatic curvature perturbation grows to dominate and contributes a blue spectrum that spoils the scale - invariance . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , a scalar shear perturbation grows nonlinear and creates an overwhelming anisotropy that disrupts the nonsingular bounce altogether . </S>"
