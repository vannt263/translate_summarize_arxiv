    "gravitationally bound molecular cores with no embedded infrared sources , referred to as pre - protostellar cores ( ppcs ) , offer the unique opportunity to study the conditions preceding stellar birth . to date",
    "there have only been a few ppcs studied in depth leaving many unanswered questions regarding the kinematics and chemistry during this epoch of star formation .",
    "inward gas motions are necessary for the formation of stars and the kinematic signatures of these motions are expected to be present in molecular line data .",
    "blue - peaked asymmetric line profiles commonly seen in optically thick tracers of molecular cores can be accurately modeled as self - absorbed infalling gas  @xcite .",
    "a high ratio of blue - peaked to red - peaked profiles in selected cores is further evidence that these spectral signatures are tracing global infall in some ppcs  @xcite .",
    "these `` infall asymmetries '' imply infall velocities of up to @xmath7kms@xmath3 extending out to @xmath8pc  @xcite inconsistent with the ambipolar diffusion paradigm of isolated low - mass star formation  @xcite .",
    "the observed decrement in abundance of certain molecules such as co and cs toward the centers of cores  @xcite can be explained by the expected depletion of these species onto dust grains  @xcite . in some ppcs",
    "the abundance profile is best fit using a model with a central region of complete depletion  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "models have shown that depletion becomes more severe as a core collapses suggesting that chemical depletion may be useful in determining the age of ppcs  @xcite .",
    "however , detailed molecular line studies have shown that chemistry is not reliable as a sole evolutionary indicator  @xcite and interpretations should be made on a case by case basis  @xcite .",
    "analytic models of asymmetric molecular line profiles  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide quick solutions by imposing functional forms for molecular excitation and chemistry along the line of sight .",
    "these models have been shown to reliably characterize simulated data despite using the simplest available assumptions  @xcite .",
    "numerical models typically contain less assumptions and are hence more flexible , but are computationally much more costly .",

    "following the discovery and primary characterization of this starless molecular core",
    "( paper  i ) , this article investigates dynamical and chemical signatures from new molecular line data in an attempt to understand its state of evolution toward stellar birth .    in  [ sobs ] we outline the molecular line observations used with the observations of paper  i to analyze l1551  mc . the models used to interpret these data are described in  [ smodels ] with the results presented in  [ sresults ] .",
    "further consideration of these results in  [ sdisc ] reveal the main conclusions of this paper which are then summarized in  [ sconc ] .",
    "we used the five college radio astronomy observatory s 14 m telescope on the nights of 2005 january 7 and 8 , and for partial nights on february 8 , 9 and 24 to map l1551  mc in n@xmath0h@xmath1and cs simultaneously .",
    "the weather was variable on the nights of january 7 and 8 with system temperatures varying from @xmath10k to @xmath11k .",
    "the partial nights were substantially better showing system temperatures from @xmath12k to @xmath13k .",
    "the observing frequencies in the first and second if of the dual channel correlator ( dcc ) were set to 93.176258ghz and 97.980953ghz , corresponding to the isolated component of the n@xmath0h@xmath1@xmath14 and the cs@xmath15 rotational transitions  @xcite respectively , for our maps .",
    "the beam at these observing frequencies has a fwhm of @xmath16 and a main beam efficiency @xmath17 .",
    "the highest spectral resolution mode of the dcc was used giving a 25mhz band with 1024 channels resulting in @xmath18kms@xmath3 velocity resolution .    a @xmath19 patch of sky",
    "was mapped centered on l1551  mc , @xmath20 , @xmath21(j2000.0 ) , using the on - the - fly observing technique .",
    "our final maps are a composite of @xmath22 individual maps created by scanning alternatively in the right ascension and declination directions combined by weighted mean .",
    "these maps are highly oversampled given the 12 row spacing , 60s@xmath3 scan speed and the rotation of the sequoia 32 element receiver array with paralactic angle .",
    "the data are calibrated with an off scan every two rows and a total power calibration scan every four rows .",
    "these data were reduced , gridded and output to fits files using the otftool utility available at the observatory .",
    "the rms noise level in our final cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 maps is @xmath23mk .",
    "all further analysis was performed using the idl software of research systems inc .",
    "we use a non - linear least squares minimization based on the levenberg - marquardt technique to find the best fits to our spectral line data according to two distinctly different radiative transfer models .",
    "the analytic model fits the asymmetric cs line profiles while the family of numerical models use information from the optically thin n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission to fit both the cs and the co isotopologue data .",
    "the hill5 model presented in @xcite assumes a symmetric 1-dimensional structure for all parameters .",
    "the central excitation temperature , @xmath24 , tapers linearly to the cloud edge where it has a value of @xmath25k .",
    "gas approaches the center of this model system at a constant velocity , @xmath26 , relative to the systemic velocity , @xmath27 .",
    "including the central optical depth , @xmath28 , and the velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath29 , there are a total of 5 free parameters .",
    "the hill5 model is the preferred model in  @xcite giving estimates of the infall velocity in simulated observations good to 0.02kms@xmath3 .",
    "the `` rt '' program introduced in @xcite ( also see * ? ? ? * ) computes the full , non - equilibrium radiative transfer for a spherically symmetric mass .",
    "this fortran code takes the density , kinematics , kinetic temperature and molecular abundance ratio as a function of core radius and solves for the level populations using a lambda - iteration technique .",
    "table  [ da94table ] outlines the fixed and free parameters which define our family of numerical models and table  [ da94models ] summarizes the individual models described in the following subsections .",
    "the density of molecular hydrogen is represented by @xmath30 .",
    "the density of a molecular species is denoted by @xmath31 and is related to the total density by the conversion factor , @xmath32 .",
    "the infall velocity , @xmath26 , is equal to @xmath33 at the minimum radius of the model and follows a power law form with index @xmath34 .",
    "the model core is isothermal with a constant turbulent velocity width @xmath35 .",
    "quantities are evaluated at 40 logarithmically spaced radii from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the fixed parameters , except for the radii , are derived from the nh@xmath9 data of paper  i. the maximum radius represents the extent of the cs emission . the minimum radius was chosen in consideration of a timely convergence and our results are not sensitive to its exact value .",
    "all models have as free parameters @xmath38 , @xmath33 , and @xmath32 .",
    "each numerical model comprises a substantial parameter space to explore . the density and infall velocities are therefore constrained to @xmath39@xmath40 and @xmath41kms@xmath3 in accord with the results of paper  i. for each model the best fit was determined by repeating the least - squares minimization procedure beginning at randomly chosen parameter values until the global minimum in @xmath42 space was converged upon .",
    "these models were first used to fit the cs@xmath15 line profiles and then modified to fit for the conversion factors for @xmath43co and c@xmath6o given the best fit parameters from the cs fits .",
    "the kinetic temperature and turbulent velocity width are also free parameters in these fits to account for the possibility that the co isotopologues are tracing different environments within l1551  mc .",
    "upper limits of 12k  @xcite and 0.5kms@xmath3 were enforced for @xmath44 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the systemic velocity for all the numerical models is obtained from fits to the full n@xmath0h@xmath1@xmath14 transition with the hyperfine fitting routine developed in paper  i. this routine returns the optical depth , velocity centroid , velocity width , and excitation temperature for a given spectrum .",
    "the normalized root mean square of the error is used as our goodness of fit indicator defined by @xmath45 where @xmath29 is the rms noise level in the spectrum , @xmath46 is the number of data points used in the fit , @xmath47 are the data points and @xmath48 are the model points .",
    "values of @xmath49 are expected for successful fits .",
    "there are six total numerical models denoted by an identifier and a roman numeral ( table  [ da94models ] ) .",
    "each pair of models are identical except for the abundance profile which is either constant throughout or takes the form @xmath50 which is referred to as a `` drop '' abundance profile . the models are further grouped by the assumed velocity structure into two main categories , accretion and collapse .",
    "the first four models are referred to as `` accretion '' models because they allow for the possibility of high velocity gas in the outer regions of the core .",
    "model acv - i is like the hill5 analytic model , but the radiative transfer is solved for numerically .",
    "therefore , the infall velocity from acv - i can be compared to the results of the hill5 model for consistency .",
    "model acv - ii is used to test whether or not having a depletion zone significantly alters the derived infall velocity .",
    "models a - i and ii have a velocity profile that increases as the square root of the core radius and represent scenarios in which gas is accreting onto the core from large radii .",
    "these models , in comparison with the others , test if the highest velocity infalling gas is in the exterior regions of the core .",
    "models gc - i and ii have velocity structures chosen to represent inside - out collapse , as in @xcite . given the complexity of l1551  mc from observations",
    "a detailed comparison with theoretical models would be difficult .",
    "however , free - fall collapse is generally expected to produce a decreasing velocity profile with radius from the center of the core to the rarefaction front  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore these models test if the motions implied by the cs emission are consistent with the motions expected from gravitational collapse directly associated with the formation of a protostar .",
    "figure  [ specoverlay ] shows the distribution of velocity integrated n@xmath0h@xmath1 in greyscale overlaid with independent cs@xmath15 spectra at their respective plane - of - sky locations .",
    "the vertical dotted lines shown in selected spectra are the systemic velocities from the hyperfine fits to the n@xmath0h@xmath1 profiles .",
    "most cs line profiles are asymmetric having a peak blueward of the systemic velocity and a smaller red peak or shoulder .",
    "the normalized velocity difference introduced in @xcite is a useful quantity to characterize spectral asymmetries . using cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 as optically thick and thin molecular species",
    ", we define @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the velocity centroid of the brightest peak in the cs line profile and the velocity centroid and intrinsic fwhm of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are obtained from hyperfine fitting .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission is less extended than the cs emission , so it is the 31 beam - sampled spectra with well - determined centroids ( @xmath55 ) that define our sample .",
    "figure  [ dvcshist ] shows a histogram of the @xmath56 values .",
    "the cross - hatched area corresponds to @xmath56 values that are greater than 5 times the estimated error ( @xmath57 ) obtained from standard propagation of error .",
    "the values for @xmath57 range from 0.03 to 0.4 with a median of 0.10 . the mean value @xmath58@xmath56@xmath59 .",
    "the blue excess is defined as @xmath60  @xcite , where @xmath61 is the number of positions with @xmath56 @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the number of positions with @xmath56 @xmath64 and here @xmath65 .",
    "the blue excess of l1551  mc is high , @xmath66 , meaning a significant fraction of cs lines have a blue peak .    the @xmath67 value of the student t - test measures of the probability that a given sample of values was drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero . for the 31 @xmath56 values in l1551",
    "mc , @xmath67 is less than 0.5% .",
    "together with a high @xmath68 value , this means that the asymmetric cs profiles are not random but are strongly biased toward having a blue peak . in relation to the cores studied in @xcite ,",
    "l1551  mc would rank as a bona fide infall candidate .",
    "the 18 spectra with @xmath69@xmath56@xmath70 are fit according to the hill5 model .",
    "three of these 18 spectra return positive ( outflowing ) gas velocities and correspond precisely to the three spectra that show positive @xmath56 values in figure  [ dvcshist ] . of the 15 spectra that show negative ( infalling ) gas velocities , the mean @xmath71kms@xmath3 , roughly two thirds the sound speed in the medium",
    ".    averages of our molecular line data within the central 100 of l1551  mc ( dashed circle in figure  [ specoverlay ] ) yield high signal - to - noise composite spectra in cs , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , @xmath43co , and c@xmath6o . the best fit to the cs composite spectrum using the hill5 model is outlined in table  [ hillfittable ] and is presented as the dotted line on the cs spectrum of figure  [ specfits ] .",
    "the fit is good overall , but slightly overestimates the emission in the red wing of the profile .",
    "the results from the numerical fits are summarized in table  [ daresults ] .",
    "the best fit to the cs composite spectrum was achieved with model a - ii with an rmse value of 0.77 and is shown as the dashed line on the cs spectrum of figure  [ specfits ] .",
    "the constant velocity models , acv - i and ii fit the data fairly well and are in agreement with the hill5 results , while the collapse models , gc - i and ii , produce the worst agreement with the data .",
    "there is a surplus of blue peaked asymmetric cs line profiles in l1551  mc successfully modeled as self - absorption from globally infalling gas (  [ sresults ] ) . in both our analytic and numerical models , gas velocities",
    "@xmath72kms@xmath3 are needed to account for the observed cs profiles .",
    "these motions are not associated with any of the known outflows in the l1551 cloud , including those from irs5",
    "@xcite , l1551 ne  @xcite and xz / hl tau  @xcite . a closer look at our results reveals insights into the nature of these observed dynamics .",
    "figure  [ compare ] shows a direct comparison between the best `` collapse '' model fit , gc - i , and the best `` accretion '' model fit , a - ii .",
    "the gc models produce the least consistent fits to our data . in these models",
    "the absorbing gas is in the outer regions of the core where the excitation temperatures are lowest and where gas is moving at relatively slow velocities .",
    "therefore , these models produce centralized self - absorption with a double peaked profile instead of the observed red shoulder .",
    "higher values of @xmath33 push the absorption feature slightly further to the red and this is why the best fits for the gravitational collapse models are pegged against the @xmath73kms@xmath3 limit set by our constraint on highly supersonic gas (  [ snmodels ] ) .    the constant velocity accretion models , acv - i and ii , do substantially better than the inside - out collapse models allowing for absorption and emission of high velocity gas .",
    "but the monotonically increasing infall velocity of the a - i and ii accretion models works together with the decreasing cs excitation temperature as a function of radius to carve a smooth red shoulder in the line profile most consistent with our data .",
    "a marginally better fit to the data is achieved with the drop abundance profile of a - ii and we use this as the preferred model .",
    "the observed self - absorption in the cs line profiles forces our numerical model fits into the optically thick regime .",
    "it is therefore the dynamics , rather than the chemistry or mass distribution , that most significantly affects the emergent line profiles .",
    "our fits show that infalling gas is needed in the outer regions of the core to reproduce the observed cs line profiles .",
    "the hill5 model fits to the ensemble of cs spectra also show high infall velocities at large projected core radii ( see  [ saccretion ] ) .    according to the standard model of low - mass star formation  @xcite ,",
    "a core collapses via ambipolar diffusion until it becomes supercritical and then undergoes an inside - out collapse .",
    "the high infall velocities at large core radii indicated by our models are comparable to other closely studied cores where the dynamics were found to be inconsistent with the standard model  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from our models",
    "it is clear that the gas motions observed across l1551  mc do not represent infalling gas due to gravitational collapse and have magnitudes too large to be associated with ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the high infall velocities observed over a large angular extent around l1551  mc are more consistent with planar accretion .",
    "planar accretion would produce this observational signature for a wide range of inclination angles .",
    "the magnetic field around l1551 has been measured to be fairly uniform  @xcite and a roughly constant field could facilitate a planar accretion scenario . however , measurements of the magnetic field geometry in l1551  mc are essential to clarify this situation .    from the analytic and numerical modeling of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and cs spectra in l1551",
    "mc it appears that gas is falling toward the mid - plane of the core from large radii .",
    "the observed dynamics are not directly related to the formation of a star , but do not preclude gravitational collapse scenarios  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "high infall velocities are derived from the hill5 model for a vast majority of the cs spectra which span @xmath746 , or 0.24pc at the distance of taurus .",
    "this loosely defines a radius at which material is infalling , @xmath75pc .",
    "the mass infall rate is estimated as the amount of material passing through a spherical surface with radius @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "here we use a density of @xmath78@xmath40 and an infall velocity of 0.02kms@xmath3 derived from the model a - ii best fit parameters and the density and velocity relations from table  [ da94table ] evaluated at @xmath76 . the derived infall rate @xmath79@xmath5yr@xmath3 .",
    "values of the average density ( paper  i ) and average infall velocity (  [ smodelfits ] ) yield an accretion rate of the same order of magnitude as does planar infall at a constant velocity of 0.1kms@xmath3 . due to the unknown geometry and symmetry in this problem the accretion rate can not be constrained within a factor of @xmath80 .",
    "a fit to the mean spectrum within a half power contour of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 velocity integrated emission gives a central velocity of @xmath81kms@xmath3 , an observed line width of @xmath82kms@xmath3 translating into a non - thermal width of @xmath83kms@xmath3 for a kinetic temperature of 9k and a total optical depth of 4.03 ( @xmath84 for the isolated component ) .",
    "this is very similar to the nh@xmath9 emission with @xmath85kms@xmath3 and @xmath86kms@xmath3  ( paper  i ) .",
    "the sky distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 also follows the nh@xmath9 closely with a major and minor fwhm of @xmath87 and @xmath88 oriented at a position angle of @xmath89 compared to the nh@xmath9 values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the emission from both molecular species peak at the same sky coordinates and coincide precisely with a peak in the sub - mm dust continuum  @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1 velocity gradient across the core is 1.3kms@xmath3pc@xmath3 at a position angle of @xmath93 compared to the nh@xmath9 values of 1.2kms@xmath3pc@xmath3 and @xmath94 .",
    "therefore it seems the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and nh@xmath9 emission trace the same high - density interior gas in l1551  mc .",
    "figure  [ profiles ] compares the radial profiles of nh@xmath9 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , cs , and c@xmath6o .",
    "the nh@xmath9 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 profiles are fit using equation 1 and the cs and c@xmath6o profiles are fit using equation 2 of paper  i. the radial distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is slightly flatter than the nh@xmath9 which may be due to a slight overabundance of nh@xmath9 in the innermost regions as seen in other taurus cores  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cs and c@xmath6o profiles are significantly flatter than the nh@xmath9 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 suggesting that the relative abundance of these species is higher at larger radii .",
    "while this may be due in part to the optical depth of cs , the c@xmath6o is optically thin in this region ( see  [ sco ] ) .",
    "figure  [ velintcs ] shows that the cs has a much broader distribution on the sky compared to the n@xmath0h@xmath1 despite the similarity in critical density values for the transitions . a depression in the cs emission @xmath95 northwest of the peak n@xmath0h@xmath1 and nh@xmath9 emission",
    "is also seen in figure  [ velintcs ] that coincides with a deficit in c@xmath6o emission .",
    "this slight depression is bordered on the southwestern edge by the c@xmath0s emission and may signify a depletion zone .",
    "it is not clear whether or not significant depletion has occurred in the inner regions of l1551  mc since chemical effects can not be sufficiently isolated with our models .",
    "however , the relative deficit of emission from both c@xmath6o and cs at small radii indicate some depletion of these species has occurred presumably due to chemical evolution related to core contraction  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ specfits ] shows the best fit to the composite co isotopologue spectra and table  [ dacotable ] outlines the fit results .",
    "the best fit turbulent velocities for our co isotopologues are a factor of 1.5 higher than the cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 fits .",
    "these larger values are likely due to the co isotopologues tracing a larger volume along the line of sight .",
    "the co isotopologues are tracing cold gas with the @xmath43co and c@xmath6o being optically thick and thin respectively .",
    "the abundance of both isotopologues derived from our models are consistent with observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the centroid of the c@xmath6o line agrees well with the centroid of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 ( see figure  [ specfits ] ) in accord with the results from @xcite .",
    "the shape of the @xmath43co line profile , slightly broadened by optical depth , is fit well with model a - ii , but the central velocity is clearly shifted .",
    "this shift accounts for the anomalously high rmse values in table  [ dacotable ] .",
    "a cross correlation between the model a - ii fit and the observed spectrum peaks at a lag of 7.1khz corresponding to a velocity offset of 0.02kms@xmath3 at this transition frequency .",
    "this is not accounted for in the stated measurement errors for the published frequency equal to @xmath101khz  @xcite .",
    "if this offset were due to an error in the chosen observing frequency , a best estimate of the true frequency would be 110.2013470ghz .",
    "it is likely that cs and c@xmath0s share the same chemical pathway in the interstellar medium  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet the critical density of cs@xmath15 is an order of magnitude higher than c@xmath0s@xmath102  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible for these species to exist in the same environment in different excitation states .",
    "the c@xmath0s emission in l1551  mc is shifted to the red of the systemic velocity ( see paper  i ) while the cs spectrum shows redshifted self - absorption .",

    "the composite cs spectrum shows a blue peaked , asymmetric profile .",
    "the best fit to this spectrum using the hill5 model returns an infall velocity of @xmath103kms@xmath3 , nearly identical to the velocity centroid of the c@xmath0s emission .",
    "this supports the idea that the c@xmath0s emission is tracing the cs absorption layer , but it still remains unclear why there is no blue component to the c@xmath0s profile .",
    "chemistry is likely responsible .",
    "high spectral resolution maps of cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 taken with the fcrao 14 m telescope are fit with two distinctly different radiative transfer models to gain insight into the dynamical and chemical evolution of the recently discovered ppc in taurus , l1551  mc .    the analytic and numerical models both suggest that l1551  mc is in the early stages of dynamical evolution .",
    "infall velocities of @xmath72kms@xmath3 are needed in the outer regions of l1551  mc to fit our data adequately .",

    "if this is due to an incorrect observing frequency , the best estimate for the true transition frequency is 110.2013470ghz .",
    "the c@xmath0s emission seen in paper  i may be tracing the infalling cs gas that is producing the observed self - absorption .",
