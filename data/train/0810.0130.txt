    "a lot of astrophysical interest has emerged in the strange star models of sqm following the x - ray observations of compact sources like rx j1856.5 - 3754 , sax j1808.4 - 3658 , 4u 1728 - 34 and psr 0943 + 10 etc . by the satellite _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. in particular , the strange star models of day et al ( 1998 ) have been presented as the most successful description of these sources ( drake et al 2002 ; li et al 1999a ; li et al 1999b ; xu 2002 ) . some authors , however , have shown that the mit bag models of sqm can also explain the small value of the radiation radius , @xmath2 , ranging from 3.8 - 8.2 km ( drake et al 2002 ) for a mass of about 1@xmath3 corresponding to the compact star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( kohri et al 2003 ; but for an alternative model , see , e.g. walter & lattimer 2002 ) .",
    "although the possibility of the existence of hypothetical self - bound sqm stars dates back to eighties ( witten 1984 ; fahri & jaffe 1984 ; haensel et al 1986 ; alcock et al 1986 etc . ) , but the possibility of the existence of such stars made of pure sqm ( i.e. corresponding to a single equation of state ( eos ) of self - bound matter ) in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium have never been questioned .",
    "recently , negi & durgapal ( 2001 ) have obtained a ` compatibility criterion ' for ascertaining the state of hydrostatic equilibrium in static spherical structures .",
    "this criterion states that `` for each and every assigned value of @xmath4 the ratio of central pressure to central energy - density ] , the compactness ratio @xmath5 of the entire configuration should not exceed the compactness ratio , @xmath6 , of the corresponding homogeneous density sphere ( that is , @xmath7 ) '' . on the basis of this criterion",
    ", they have demonstrated that the ` regular ' configurations corresponding to a single eos or density variation do not exist in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium . as an example",
    ", they have shown this inconsistency , particularly for the stiffest eos of self - bound matter , @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath10 is the energy - density and @xmath11 represents the surface density at zero pressure ; we consider @xmath12 ( i.e. , the geometrized units ) ) .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency is explained by negi ( 2004a ; 2006 ) . from this explanation",
    ", one can easily extract the following statement that ` regular ' configurations corresponding to a single eos or density variation _ can _ not exist in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "even more recently , the ` compatibility criterion ' is established as theorem 1 and the dependency of necessary and sufficient condition for dynamical stability provided by the mass - radius ( @xmath13 ) relation on this theorem is obtained as theorem 2 ( and its subsequent corollaries ) in negi ( 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "the present study deals with the construction of such theorems for different values of the parameter @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 corresponding to the eos @xmath16 .",
    "this range can cover the mit bag models of sqm ( called the sqm0 , sqm1 and sqm2 in the literature ; see , e.g. haensel et al 2006 , and references therein ) and the models of day et al ( 1998 ) ( called ss1 and ss2 ) mentioned above . while the mit bag models , we consider in the present study , provide the masses of strange stars as large as those ` observed ' for any neutron star , the sequences of day et al ( 1998 ) can produce the most compact configurations of strange stars among various models of sqm available in the literature .",
    "these sequences are , therefore , widely used in the literature to explain : the relatively smaller values of the stellar radius ` observed ' for the sources like rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( drake et al 2002 ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( li et al 1999a ) and the khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed among various low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( see , e.g. , li et al 1999b ; zdunik 2000 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the absolute upper bound on compactness ratio for any dynamically stable regular configuration may be obtained by using the ` compressible ' sphere of homogeneous energy - density ( negi 2004b ) , since the following relation holds good for a constant @xmath17      obviously , the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath19 , will become finite inside such configuration for a finite ( constant ) value of @xmath17 . in order to have a desired value of @xmath20 at the centre of ` compressible ' homogeneous density sphere",
    ", one can work out a particular value of @xmath21 and the corresponding ( critical ) value of constant @xmath17 for which the configuration remains pulsationally stable .",
    "this particular value of @xmath21 represents an absolute upper bound , @xmath22 , consistent with that of the condition @xmath23 and dynamical stability , since it follows from the ` compatibility criterion ' ( theorem 1 of negi 2007 ; and references therein ) that corresponding to this particular @xmath21 value @xmath24 , any regular configuration can not have a value of the ratio of central pressure to central energy - density , @xmath25 ( or , equivalently , a central value of the ` local ' adiabatic index @xmath26(dp / de)_0)$ ] less than ( greater than ) that of the homogeneous density sphere .",
    "notice that this result may be generalized for a number of relativistic star sequences provided that every member of that particular sequence satisfies the condition @xmath27 ( say ) ( here and elsewhere in this paper , the subscript `` 0 '' refers the value of the corresponding quantity at the centre ) .",
    "it follows from the previous studies ( negi 2007 ; 2004b ) that in order to assure the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability for a mass , the maximum stable value of @xmath28(corresponding to the first maximum along masses in the stable branch of mass - radius ( @xmath13 ) relation ) and the corresponding central value of the ` local ' adiabatic index @xmath29 of the said sequence must satisfy the inequalities @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32(critical ) constant @xmath17 ) simultaneously .    following the previous study ( negi 2004b )",
    ", we obtain various @xmath21 and the ( critical ) constant @xmath17 values for dynamically stable configuration corresponding to various values of @xmath33 at the centre of ` compressible ' homogeneous density sphere as shown in table 1 .",
    "since these results are also applicable to the sequences of strange quark stars characterized by the pure eos @xmath34 , their applicability ( according to various values of the parameter @xmath14 appearing in this eos as shown in column 5 ) is indicated in column 1 of table 1 . in view of the discussion of last paragraph",
    ", the various @xmath21 and the ( critical ) constant @xmath17 values are indicated here as @xmath22 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    ".the absolute maximum stable values of compactness ratio ( @xmath36 ) and the corresponding central value of the ` local ' adiabatic index @xmath35 for the equilibrium sequences satisfying the condition @xmath37 at the centre of the configuration as shown in column 5 .",
    "these values of the parameter @xmath14 which are appearing in the eos , @xmath34 , correspond to the models of strange quark stars shown in column 1 .",
    "a comparison of the pair of these absolute values with those of the pair of corresponding values obtained for the models of pure strange quark matter ( tables 3 - 7 ) clearly shows that the mass - radius diagram corresponding to any sequences of the strange quark stars ( shown in fig.1 ) does not provide a necessary and sufficient condition for dynamical stability for the equilibrium configurations .
