    "non - abelian gauge theories are central to our current understanding of physical phenomena ( excluding gravity ) .",
    "the perturbative analysis of such theories is fairly well understood by now , having been extensively developed over the last three decades .",
    "many of the nonperturbative aspects are also more or less understood at a qualitative level .",
    "however , it is fair to say that , as of now , we do not have calculational techniques or detailed understanding regarding nonperturbative phenomena in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "let us summarize the standard lore attributed to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) : ( a ) qcd must have a mass gap , i.e. , every excitation above the vacuum state must have energy @xmath2 ; ( b ) qcd must exhibit quark confinement , i.e. , the observed ( physical ) particle spectrum are color su(3 ) invariant , despite the fact that qcd is described by an underlying lagrangian of quarks and non - abelian gluons , which transform non - trivially under color su(3 ) symmetry ; ( c ) qcd must exhibit chiral symmetry breakdown , i.e. the vacuum is only invariant under a subgroup of the full symmetry group acting on the quark fields , in the limit of vanishing current quark masses",
    ".    item ( a ) is essential to understand the short - range of the nuclear force . item ( b ) is essential to account for the absence ( unobservability ) of individual free quarks . and finally , item ( c ) is essential to justify the spectacular current algebra predictions .    the perturbative description of elementary particles is essentially based on the field - particle duality which means that each field in a quantum field theory is associated with a physical particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation in qcd is more complicated , however . for a description of confinement of quarks and gluons within the framework of local quantum field theory , the elementary fields have to be divorced completely from a particle interpretation @xcite .",
    "therefore , to study the infrared behavior of qcd amplitudes non - perturbative methods are required .",
    "one promising approach to non - perturbative phenomena in qcd is provided by studies of truncated systems of its dyson - schwinger equations , the equations of motion for qcd greens functions .",
    "the underlying conjecture to justify such a truncation of the originally infinite set of dyson - schwinger equations is that a successive inclusion of higher n - point functions in self - consistent calculations will not result in dramatic changes to previously obtained lower n - point functions . to achieve this",
    "it is important to incorporate as much independent information as possible in constructing those n - point functions which close the system .",
    "usually the attempts to solve problems in qcd are based on notion of gluon  a quantum of su(3 ) gauge field . tacitly assuming that quantized field is a cloud of quanta ( gluons in qcd ) .",
    "but this is not evident for a quantum field theory with strong interaction where it is necessary to use a nonperturbative quantum field theory .",
    "it is possible that strongly interacting quantum fields more similar to a turbulent fluid where is a preferred direction ( for example , it can be flux tube stretched between quark and antiquark ) and fluctuations around nonzero field there exist . in standard quantum field theory",
    "the interaction between quanta happens in a vertex .",
    "the vertex is 0-dimensional object where 0-dimensional objects ",
    "particles do interact .",
    "all it gives rise to the idea that strongly interacting quantum fields can not be described on the language of particles  quanta .",
    "mathematically it means that in this case it is not possible to use feynman diagram technique to the description of strongly interacting quantum fields .",
    "the consequence of this statement is : in other words strongly interacting quantized fields do exist but they do not formed with quanta .",
    "for example , quantum gluon field does exist but gluons ( in some energy region ) do not exist , for gravity this statement is even more strict : quantum gravity does exist but gravitons do not exist .",
    "here we use the idea that the operator of strongly interacting field can be decomposed on constituents ( hidden structure of the operator ) . in order to these constituents are invisible we assume that they are nonassociative operators . by calculation of expectation value",
    "we need to rearrange of brackets that leads to the appearance of additional terms in the same way as planck constant appears by the operators permutation in standard quantum field theory . following this way we calculate 4-point green s function . in this case",
    "additional terms appear in the consequence of the operator hidden structure . in order to avoid solving an infinite set of nonperturbative equations connecting all green s functions we calculate gluon condensate assuming that : ( a ) 4-point green s function approximately can be presented as a bilinear combination of 2-point green s functions ; ( b ) 2point green s function can be approximately presented as the product of scalar fields ( scalar approximation ) .",
    "it means that these scalar fields describe the correlation of quantized fields in two separated points .",
    "if two points coincide then the scalar fields describe the mean value of the square of quantum fields , i.e. the dispersion of quantum fields around their vacuum value . in order to obtain equations for the scalar fields we average the su(3 ) lagrangian ( which is none other than gluon condensate ) .",
    "finally we obtain the lagrangian for the scalar fields .",
    "we solve these equations numerically in the spherically symmetric case . as result",
    "we obtain a ball filled with fluctuating quantum su(3 ) gauge field that can be presented as a model of glueball .",
    "the solution does exist for a special choice of the value of the scalar fields at the center only .",
    "one can say that corresponding scalar fields are eigenfunctions of corresponding nonlinear differential equations .",
    "it means that the ball filled with fluctuating su(3 ) gauge field can have unique value of energy .",
    "the ball can not have the energy value small as possible , i.e.    thus the main idea considered here is to offer an approach to the quantization of strongly interacting fields do not using the notion of quantum .",
    "some reviews about nonperturbative physics in qcd are : ( a ) the studies of qcd greens functions and their applications in hadronic physics in @xcite ; ( b ) light - cone quantization of gauge theories in @xcite ; ( c ) the theory and phenomenology of instantons in qcd in @xcite ; ( d ) numerous aspects and mechanisms of color confinement in qcd are surveyed in @xcite ; ( e ) in ref .",
    "@xcite recent results in the physics of glueballs with the aim set on phenomenology is reviewed and the possibility of finding them in conventional hadronic experiments and in the quark gluon plasma is discussed . the nonperturbative approach for the quantization of strongly interacting spinor field was presented in ref .",

    "@xcite general arguments are presented that only scalar glueballs should exist using the requirement that the gluon field have to satisfy the canonical angular momentum relationship .",
    "following to calculations from appendix [ nadecomposition ] we can obtain an effective lagrangian describing non - perturbative quantum fluctuations of su(3 ) gauge field .",
    "the lagrangian is obtained by averaging of su(3 ) lagrangian using a hidden structure of field operators .",
    "the hidden structure means that the operators of strongly interacting fields have can be decomposed into the product of some operators ( constituents )",
    ". such invisibility can be only if the constituents are non - associative operators .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing gluon condensate is @xmath3 where the scalar field @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe quantum fluctations of gauge potential belonging to a small subgroup @xmath0 and coset @xmath6 correspondingly .",
    "it is necessary to note that for the construction of a scalar model of glueball these fluctuations are essentially different .",

    "the numerical analysis shows that regular solutions exist for a special choice of boundary conditions @xmath10 only , when the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are fixed .",
    "one remark is that technically ( for the numerical calculations ) it is easier to fix @xmath11 , @xmath13 and search special values for @xmath12 . for the details of numerical calculations",
    "one can see ref.@xcite .    by some technical reasons we will fix @xmath13 and using shooting method we will find special values of @xmath12 for",
    "which regular solution does exist .",
    "we will search regular solutions with the following boundary conditions @xmath14 after that we redefine functions and parameters in eq s in following way : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the negativity and positivity of the dispersions @xmath41 and @xmath44 means that in the first case the components @xmath45 are dominant and in the second case the component @xmath46 is dominant .",
    "the main result of this research is that we have obtained an approximate model of gluon condensate using two scalar fields approximation and the spherical symmetric distribution of gluon condensate as glueball is interpreted .",
    "the numerical calculations show that for given parameters @xmath47 there exists a unique value of scalar fields at the center @xmath48 and @xmath49 that the solution is regular .",
    "it means that in the theory with given parameters @xmath47 there exists a unique excited state of nonperturbative quantized su(3 ) gauge field with the energy @xmath50 .",
    "this unique value of the energy is a mass gap @xmath51 for given parameters @xmath47 .",
    "let us remember that scalar fields @xmath52 describe quantum fluctuations of the components belonging to small subgroup and coset .",
    "thus our solution describes a ball filled with quantum fluctuations of the su(3 ) gauge potential .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of @xmath53 and @xmath54 have different behavior .",
    "interesting problem in two scalar fields approach is its gauge invariance .",
    "the condensates and are not gauge invariant .",
    "the question is : is it necessary to this approach or it is possible to avoid this problem ?",
    "we see two possibilities : the first one is that the nonperturbative quantization leads with the necessity to the violation of gauge invariance of gauge theories ; the second one is that one can use a minimal value of the condensates and following to ref s",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "let us note that a discrete spectrum of the energy of localized field distribution have been found in ref .",
    "@xcite for non - linear klein gordon and dirac equations .",
    "the difference with our case is that non - linear klein gordon and dirac equations have infinite energy spectrum where the first state can be identified with mass gap . in our case two interacting ginzburg ",
    "landau equations are constructed in such a manner that we have only one regular solution which we indentify with the mass gap .",
    "the most unexpected feature of presented approach is the appearance of a hidden structure of operators of strongly interacting fields . in order to mask this structure",
    "it is make the constituents of the operator decomposition as non - associative quantities .",
    "such non - associative decomposition leads to nonperturbative quantum corrections which appears as exponential decreasing of quantum fluctuations , see .",
    "the values of these corrections can be in principle estimated as the size and energy of glueball .",
    "another interesting feature is that the components of gauge potential belonging to a small subgroup @xmath0 and coset @xmath1 behave variously : in quantum fluctuations of gauge potential belonging to the @xmath55 the @xmath56 component is dominant but for quantum fluctuations of gauge potential belonging to the coset @xmath1 the @xmath57 space components are dominant .",
    "it should be noted that the parameters @xmath12 in eq s can be omitted and obtained in following way : ( 1 ) scalar fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 are complex - valued fields ; ( 2 ) the parameters @xmath12 in eq s are removed ; ( 3 ) the solution of eq s ( without @xmath12 ) is searched in following form @xmath58 and @xmath59 . after that we have the same equations as but with the replacement @xmath60 .",
    "it means that mathematically both approaches are equivalent .",
    "but physically these approaches are not equivalent .",
    "if we work with @xmath61 then the parameters of the theory are @xmath11 only , and @xmath61 are eigenvalues , i.e. for every @xmath62 and @xmath63 there exists the regular solution and the glueball mass decreases to zero . consequently the mass gap does not exist in this approach .",
    "but , as we have shown above , for @xmath12 approach the mass gap does exist .",
    "i am grateful to the research group linkage programme of the alexander von humboldt foundation for the support of this research and would like to express the gratitude to the department of physics of the carl von ossietzky university of oldenburg and , specially , to v. folomeev , j. kunz , and b. kleihaus for fruitful discussions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe nonassociative decomposition of strongly interacting quantum field operators ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "let us assume that operators of su(3 ) gauge field fields @xmath64 can be decomposed into non - associative ( n / a ) constituents @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the summation index , @xmath69 is spacetime index and @xmath70 is the su(3 ) color index . although the constituent operators @xmath71 are not associative , the basic idea requires their product to model an associative operator . in more mathematical terms , the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are elements in a n / a algebra @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 , which contains an associative subalgebra @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 .",

    "our goal is to average quantum version of the lagrangian which is none other that gluon condensate @xmath82 with some approximations concerning to 4-point green s function @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a quantum averaging over some quantum state @xmath85 , and @xmath86 in are the operators .    in order to calculate an expectation value we have to define the action of operators on a quantum state .",
