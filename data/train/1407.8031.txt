    "<S> we derive a quadratic - time algorithm for the genus distribution of any 3-regular , biconnected series - parallel graph , which we extend to any biconnected series - parallel graph of maximum degree at . since the biconnected components of every graph of treewidth 2 are series - parallel graphs , this yields , by use of bar - amalgamation , a quadratic - time algorithm for every graph of treewidth at most 2 and maximum degree at most 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> * version : : *    # 1    [ multiblock footnote omitted ]    [ [ section ] ]    for @xmath0 , let @xmath1 be the number of topologically distinct cellular embeddings of the graph @xmath2 in the orientable surface @xmath3 of . the _ * genus distribution * _ of the graph @xmath2 is the sequence of numbers    -12pt-6pt@xmath4 by the interpolation principle ( see theorem 3.4.1 of @xcite or theorem 4.5.3 of @xcite ) , the set @xmath5 is a set of consecutive integers . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest number in this set is the _ * minimum genus * _ of the graph @xmath2 , and the largest is the _ * maximum genus * _ of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main focus of this paper is the derivation of a quadratic - time algorithm for the genus distribution of any 3-regular , biconnected _ series - parallel graph_. this algorithm is readily extended to a quadratic - time algorithm for the genus distribution of any graph of treewidth at most  2 and maximum degree at most 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity with which this specialized algorithm can be implemented , or applied by hand with the aid of a spreadsheet , distinguishes it from the recently derived quadratic - time algorithm @xcite for the genus distribution of any class of graphs of fixed treewidth and bounded degree .    * *    five fundamental papers @xcite of the first author and his co - authors khan and poshni have established methods for calculating the genus distribution of a graph that is constructed by various kinds of amalgamation of graphs of known genus distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these methods involve _ partitioned genus distributions _ and _ productions_. in order to develop an algorithm for a specific class of graphs , the starting point is to formulate a recursive specification of the graphs in that class , in which the operations used to create larger graphs from smaller graphs are varieties of amalgamation or self - amalgamation </S>",
    "<S> . then methods similar to those of the five fundamental papers are used to calculate the genus distribution recursively . </S>",
    "<S> this paradigm was used successfully in calculating the genus distributions of 3-regular outerplanar graphs @xcite , of 4-regular outerplanar graphs @xcite , of halin graphs @xcite , and of the @xmath6-mesh graphs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the same paradigm in this paper .    * </S>",
    "<S> *    since the introduction of the concept of _ treewidth _ by robertson and seymour , bounding the treewidth has been widely used to obtain polynomial - time algorithms for problems that are otherwise np - hard . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , deciding whether an arbitrarily selected graph can be embedded in a given surface is np - complete @xcite ; however , for any class of graphs of bounded treewidth , kawarabayashi , mohar , and reed @xcite have derived a linear - time algorithm for calculating the minimum genus .    </S>",
    "<S> although outerplanar graphs have treewidth 2 , and although halin graphs and @xmath7 meshes have treewidth 3 ( see @xcite ) , decomposition trees have not occurred in the calculation of specific genus distributions in any papers as yet . nonetheless , low treewidth plays an implicit role in the recursive specification of the family of graphs in each of those papers . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in the present paper , low treewidth plays an implicit role , since it allows for a simple recursive construction of the graphs under consideration .    * *    in what follows , a _ * graph * _ is taken to be connected and devoid of self - loops , unless something else can be inferred from the immediate context . </S>",
    "<S> multi - edges are to be expected . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath8 and @xmath9 to denote the vertex set and edge set of a graph @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a connected graph is _ * biconnected * _ if it has no cutpoints .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ * embeddings * _ in this paper are cellular embeddings in oriented surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the terminology used here is predominantly consistent with @xcite and @xcite . see also @xcite , for a slightly different approach . </S>",
    "<S> we abbreviate `` face - boundary walk '' as _ * fb - walk*_.    a _ * two - terminal series - parallel graph * _ is a doubly vertex - rooted graph @xmath10 , as per the following recursive definition .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 : :    the graph @xmath12 is a    two - terminal series - parallel graph , where @xmath13    and @xmath14 are the vertices of    @xmath15 , called the _ * source root * _ and the _ * target root * _ ,    respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 : :    _ * series operation * _    @xmath17    target root @xmath14 of @xmath2 is merged    with source root @xmath18 of @xmath19 .    the amalgamated graph @xmath20 with roots    @xmath13 and @xmath21 , as in    figure [ fig : seriespar](a ) , is a two - terminal series - parallel graph . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 : :    _ * parallel operation * _    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23    the result of merging source root @xmath13 with    source root @xmath18 , and also merging target    root @xmath14 with target root    @xmath21 , as in figure [ fig : seriespar](b ) , is a    two - terminal series - parallel graph .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ht ]   -6pt    a graph @xmath2 is a _ </S>",
    "<S> * series - parallel graph * _ if there is a choice of terminals @xmath13 and @xmath14 such that @xmath10 is a two - terminal series - parallel graph . </S>",
    "<S> our definition here is consistent with that of @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a third operation , called a _ jackknife operation _ is allowed by @xcite , and the resulting class of graphs that they call `` series - parallel '' is equivalent to that of @xcite  see remark 8.1 of @xcite . the  series - parallel graphs \" in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> are identified there as the graphs with no embedded  wheatstone bridge \" ( which is duffin s terminology for a @xmath24 topological minor ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are precisely the graphs that have no @xmath24-minor ( e.g. , see proposition 1.7.2 of @xcite ) . according to theorem 17 of @xcite , the graphs without a @xmath24-minor are exactly the graphs of treewidth at most 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that our extended genus - distribution algorithm can be applied to any of them in quadratic time , and that we do not need to further explore the distinctions between the varying definitions of `` series - parallel graphs '' .    * *    section [ sec:3regsp ] derives a characterization of 3-regular , biconnected series - parallel graphs that facilitates the genus distribution algorithm for that family of graphs . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : prods ] introduces the concepts of _ partitioned genus distributions _ and _ productions_. the top - level description of an algorithm for the genus distribution of any 3-regular , biconnected series - parallel graph is given in section [ sec : algo ] . </S>",
    "<S> derive the productions needed to complete the calculation , as well as their application to calculating the genus distribution of an illustrative example . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec:3to1 ] also gives proof that the algorithm runs in quadratic time . </S>",
    "<S> extends the algorithm to all graphs of treewidth 2 and maximum .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is almost entirely self - contained , except for some details of the well - established concept of partitioned genus distributions and of the methods ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) for constructing productions ( which are quite necessary for the algorithm ) . </S>",
    "<S> prior experience with calculating genus distributions of graph amalgamations , especially as in @xcite and @xcite , is likely to be quite helpful . </S>"
