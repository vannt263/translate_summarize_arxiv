    "due to its omnipresence in many fields in physics and engineering , kinetic roughening has attracted much attention over the years , see @xcite for some earlier reviews . in many instances the properties of growth processes",
    "can be understood by analysing rather simple langevin equations .",
    "these langevin equations , which can be either linear or non - linear , provide the theorists with a class of systems that they can study in a systematic way , using a variety of techniques . in addition , these langevin equations have a wide range of applications , ranging from different growth processes to equilibrium step fluctuations at the surface of a crystal @xcite and kinetic smoothening of interfaces @xcite .",
    "the simplest langevin equations studied in this context are the linear edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite @xmath0 and noisy mullins - herring ( mh ) @xcite equations @xmath1 where the noise is usually assumed to have zero mean and to be uncorrelated : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a @xmath4-dimensional position vector located on the surface of the substrate , whereas for growth processes @xmath5 is the height of a column at position @xmath3 at time @xmath6 .    these equations ,",
    "which depend on the two parameters @xmath7 ( for the ew equation @xmath7 is the surface tension or elastic constant ) and @xmath8 ( the noise strength ) , are used to describe deposition with different relaxation mechanisms . for the ew equation the surface current responsible for the smoothening can be viewed to be due to the gravitational potential , whereas for the mh equation a surface current arises because of a chemical potential difference .",
    "a standard way to analyse kinetic roughening is to study the surface width , which typically displays the following three regimes . at the early stages the surface grows in an uncorrelated way during a regime that is sometimes called the random deposition regime . at a first crossover time @xmath9 ,",
    "correlated growth sets in .",
    "this correlated regime continues until a second crossover time @xmath10 at which the system enters the steady state regime .",
    "this time @xmath10 depends on the size of the system and shifts to larger values when increasing the linear extend of the substrate . for",
    "an infinitely large substrate @xmath10 diverges and the system never reaches the steady state .",
    "quite some attention was paid recently to the ageing processes @xcite that take place during the correlated growth regime @xcite .",
    "most of the studies focused on local quantities as for example the height - height correlation function , the response of the height to a local perturbation , the two - time roughness or the two - time incoherent scattering function @xcite . in @xcite we discussed the correlation function of the squared width and the response of the squared width to a global perturbation . studying changes both in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , our work revealed that the global response of the surface width depends on how the system is perturbed .",
    "in addition , we showed that in the correlated regime the limit value of the corresponding fluctuation - dissipation ratio only yields the trivial value zero , due to the fact that the studied quantity , the square of the surface width , is not conjugate to any of the system parameters that are changed in our protocols .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study a global quantity directly related to the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath11 being an even number ) @xmath12 showing up in the hamiltonian description that yields the corresponding stochastic equation of motion : @xmath13 inserting ( [ eqehamiltonian ] ) into ( [ eqla1 ] ) yields the linear langevin equation @xmath14 where for @xmath15 we recover the ew equation , whereas @xmath16 yields the mh equation .",
    "as we discuss in the following , our quantity , which can be computed exactly for linear langevin equations , has many advantages . on the one hand",
    ", it better describes the roughness of a surface than the surface width itself . on the other hand ,",
    "as this quantity is conjugate to @xmath7 , a change in @xmath7 yields a global response that allows us to study the corresponding fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xcite . for the case of an equilibrium steady state ( as it is for example encountered for step fluctuations on crystal surfaces ) the celebrated fluctuation - dissipation theorem is recovered , something that was not the case for the surface width @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we introduce our quantity that we calculate exactly for the linear langevin equations used in the context of non - equilibrum growth and related problems .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the corresponding correlation and response functions .",
    "we thereby show that we recover the fluctuation - dissipation ratio for equilibrium steady states .",
    "section 4 gives our conclusions .",
    "inspection of the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqehamiltonian ] ) allows us to define both for the edwards - wilkinson and the mullins - herring equations the following time - dependent global quantity that is conjugate to @xmath7 : @xmath17 for @xmath15 the quantity @xmath18 is of course readily identified with the total `` kinetic energy . '' in the following we consider as substrate @xmath4-dimensional lattices with linear extend @xmath19 . for @xmath15 our quantity",

    "for simplicity the lattice constant is assumed to be unity .",
    "note that geometrically @xmath24 is the total surface slope has been called the second order height difference correlation function @xcite . ] and @xmath25 is the sum of the curvatures .",
    "usually the roughness of a growing interface of columns of hight @xmath26 at substrate site @xmath3 is expressed by the surface width @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average height at time @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 can also be used to quantify the roughness of a surface .",
    "has been analysed in a numerical study ] in fact , it can even be argued that @xmath18 captures the roughness much better than @xmath29 . to see this ,",
    "consider the two surfaces shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which have the same number of deposited particles . whereas intuitively we would judge the surface ( b ) to be rougher than the surface ( a )",
    ", the surface width yields the same value for both cases .",
    "the value of @xmath18 , on the other hand is larger for surface ( b ) than for surface ( a ) , and this for both cases @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "= 5.25 in     for our purpose we need to derive the exact expressions for the average of @xmath18 from the solution of the corresponding linear langevin equations .",
    "writing both the height @xmath5 and the noise @xmath32 as a sum over reciprocal lattice vectors , we obtain the following expression @xmath33 where @xmath34 here @xmath35 indicates an average over the noise . the averaged quantity @xmath36 is therefore a sum over two - point correlation functions weighted by the factor @xmath37 . using the expression @xcite @xmath38 for the two - point correlation function , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 being the smaller of the times @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath42 the behaviour of @xmath36 is therefore controlled by the length scale @xmath43 , similar to the surface width @xcite . depending on the relation of @xmath44 to the maximum and minimum values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "different regimes can be discussed .",
    "\\1 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the system is in the random deposition regime .",
    "an expansion in small @xmath44 yields the expression @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 in this regime @xmath36 varies linearly in time and shows the same time dependence as the squared surface width @xcite .",
    "when @xmath52 , the system is in the saturation regime and @xmath36 reaches its maximal value , @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the numerically evaluated values of @xmath55 for various @xmath4 and @xmath11 are shown in table ( [ tableimd ] ) .    .",

    "we can simply replace the sum by an integral , yielding the result @xmath64 for the correlated regime , where @xmath65 is the surface of the @xmath66dimensional unit sphere .",
    "= 5.25 in     figure [ fig2 ] shows @xmath36 , obtained by numerically evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eqgm2 ] ) , for various values of @xmath11 and @xmath4 and various system sizes . also shown as lines are the asymptotic expressions ( [ eqg2l ] ) and ( [ eqg4l ] ) ( dashed lines ) and ( [ eqgmp ] ) ( full lines ) .",
    "the plots and the asymptotic expressions show that @xmath36 grows linearly with time @xmath6 when the system is in the random deposition regime , the pre - factor being independent of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "after the system passes the first crossover point , a pre - factor that depends on @xmath7 shows up .",
    "in the correlated regime @xmath36 approaches the steady - state value @xmath67 algebraically , with an exponent @xmath68 .",
    "we should point out that the plots of @xmath36 versus time , shown in figure [ fig2 ] , do not easily reveal the crossovers between the different growth regimes , in contrast to the surface width where the different regimes are readily identified by mere inspection .",
    "this might somehow restrict the usefulness of @xmath36 , especially in situations where the steady state value is not readily known .",
    "still , as we discuss in the following , the quantity @xmath18 has many other advantages that makes it appealing both for theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "two - time quantities are extremely useful when studying relaxation phenomena , as they allow to capture most of the processes that underly the properties of a system far from its steady state .",
    "typical quantities are the correlation and response functions , as well as combinations of these as for example the fluctuation - dissipation ratio . in the context of non - equilibrium growth processes and interface fluctuations both local @xcite and global @xcite quantities have been studied to some extent .",
    "the former include the height - height correlation function , whereas the change of the surface width to a global perturbation is an example of the latter . in the following we are deriving the corresponding exact expressions that involve the global quantity @xmath18 .",
    "we first consider the two - time correlation function of @xmath18 .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eqgm1 ] ) we have @xmath69 here we note that the first term yields @xmath70 . since @xmath58 is an even function , we have @xmath71 using the eqs .",
    "( [ eqcorrelation2hq ] ) and ( [ eqpfactor2 ] ) we obtain the connected two - point correlation function of the quantity @xmath18 : @xmath72    we can also calculate the evolution of the average of @xmath18 subjected to a perturbation when we suddenly change @xmath7 during the growth process .",
    "this is a natural thing to do as in the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqehamiltonian ] ) @xmath7 and @xmath18 are conjugate quantities .",
    "note that this is the response of a global quantity to a global perturbation .    in this case",
    ", the evolution of the average of @xmath18 can be written as @xmath73 where the notation `` @xmath74 '' indicates that the change from @xmath75 to @xmath7 at the waiting time @xmath76 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the solution of the langevin equation at times @xmath77 becomes under that change @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the solution of a surface that evolves until time @xmath76 at the value @xmath75 when starting from a flat initial state .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ eqsftla2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqgmdnu ] ) and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eqgm2 ] ) , we straightforwardly obtain the response function @xmath80 where @xmath81 .    with these exact expressions for the correlation and response functions , we can now discuss the properties of the two - time quantities in the different regimes .",
    "in addition we can also study the behavior of composite quantities , as for example the fluctuation - dissipation ratio : @xmath82    the asymptotic steady - state behavior ( i.e. the large @xmath83 limit ) is easy to obtain for both quantities .",
    "considering only the contribution from terms with minimum @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 where we have applied the approximation @xmath87 to both expressions and , in addition , the limit @xmath88 to the response function . for the fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( [ eqfdrgs ] ) we obtain in the steady state , with @xmath89 , @xmath90 assuming the validity of the einstein relation @xmath91 , which makes the steady state to be an equilibrium steady state",
    ", we recover the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath92 , as expected .",
    "the most interesting case is the case where both the waiting and observation times are in the correlated regime ( to leading order identical results are obtained when the waiting time is still in the initial rd regime ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath93 , with @xmath94 and @xmath63 . in this limit ,",
    "we replace in both equations ( [ eqgcorrelation ] ) and ( [ eqgresponse ] ) the sums by integrals and treat the integrands as hyperspherical symmetric functions ( this is the same method we used to derive the asymptotic equation for @xmath36 in the correlated regime ) . we thereby obtain the following power - law decay functions @xmath95 and @xmath96^{-2-\\frac{d}{m } }   \\label{eqgresponsep}\\ ] ] where we replaced @xmath97 by @xmath98 for the correlation function and @xmath99 by @xmath100 for the response function before integrating .",
    "these replacements correspond to retaining only the leading terms in the taylor expansions .    in the literature on physical ageing",
    "it is convention to write for a system undergoing simple ageing the two - time correlation and integrated response functions in the form @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are scaling functions which decay algebraically for large arguments : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the autocorrelation and autoresponse exponents , whereas @xmath107 is the dynamical exponent ( for our linear langevin equations we have that @xmath108 ) .",
    "recasting equations ( [ eqgcorrelationp ] ) and ( [ eqgresponsep ] ) in these ageing forms , we immediately obtain that @xmath109 , whereas the autocorrelation and autoresponse exponents are given by @xmath110 .",
    "this ageing scaling is illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] for the one - dimensional ew system .",
    "= 5.25 in     let us close this section with a more careful discussion of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( [ eqfdrgs ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in a finite system the correlated regime goes over into the stationary state at a system size dependent time @xmath10 . in the infinite system @xmath10 diverges and the correlated regime prevails for all times . for the limit value",
    "@xmath111 we therefore obtain the values @xmath112 for the infinite system and @xmath113 for the finite system , where we introduced temperature via the einstein relation .",
    "the finite system ending up in the steady state for finite times , we recover the fluctuation - dissipation ratio .",
    "if the system remains in the correlated region , the effective temperature is twice that of the heat - bath .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes can be visualized for finite systems by plotting @xmath114 for @xmath115 as done in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for that figure",
    "we plot the value of @xmath116 as a function of @xmath76 , which yields the value @xmath117 for @xmath118 and the value @xmath119 for @xmath120 . the crossover times for @xmath15 and @xmath16",

    "[ fig4 ] by the vertical lines .",
    "[ fig5 ] gives a more comprehensive view of the behaviour of @xmath121 as a function of both @xmath76 and @xmath6 for the one - dimensional ew equation .",
    "two plateaus can be distinguished in the contour plot : one for the steady state ( i.e. the regime where @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) where @xmath124 and one away from stationarity , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",
    "= 5.25 in     = 4.25 in",
    "in the past the study of global quantities in systems relaxing towards a steady state has proven very fruitful in a large variety of systems ( see the corresponding discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we did a first attempt at using global quantities in the context of correlated growth and interface fluctuations , choosing the surface width as our global quantity .",
    "however , the surface width is a complicated quantity that has the notable drawback that the conjugate system parameter is unknown .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to form a meaningful fluctuation - dissipation ratio using that quantity .    in this paper",
    "we are proposing a different global quantity for the study of kinetic roughening and related interface problems .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the effective hamiltonian used in the langevin description and is conjugate to a system parameter that can be changed in experiments @xcite . in fact , @xmath18 seems better suited to capture the roughness of a surface than the surface width itself , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "focusing on linear langevin equations we derive exact expressions for @xmath18 as well as for the corresponding correlation and response functions .",
    "this allows us to discuss also more complicated quantities as for example the fluctuation - dissipation ratio .",
    "in fact , we recover for the quantities derived from @xmath18 the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for equilibrium steady states , whereas in the correlated regime we can assign an effective temperature to our system .",
    "all calculations presented in this paper have been done in the context of linear langevin equations . however , most growth processes are governed by non - linearities .",
    "it is therefore important to clarify to what extend our results obtained for linear langevin equations remain valid when considering non - linear stochastic equations as for example the kardar - parisi - zhang equations @xcite .",
