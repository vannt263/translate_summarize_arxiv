    "they correspond to the case where the @xmath50 link of the robot arm ( cf.figs.[f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) remains in the vertical position ( downwards and upwards , respectively ) , and only the @xmath51 link is free to move .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the dynamics in the linear neighborhood of a saddle - center can always be rewritten as the sum of a _ rotational energy _",
    "term and a _ hyperbolic energy _ term .",
    "this is a consequence of moser s theorem @xcite , which establishes that in a sufficiently small neighborhood of any saddle - center point , there is a set of canonically conjugate variables so that the hamiltonian in that neighboorhood is separable into a purely rotational term , and a purely hyperbolic term .",
    "we will apply the method of normal forms to find this set of coordinates .",
    "the method of normal forms@xcite consists basically in applying taylor series expansion to the velocity field around a fixed point .",

    "the linearized solutions in the neighborhood of the pure center are @xmath68    where the frequencies @xmath69    are also related to the frequencies @xmath70 .    as to the dynamics in the neighborhood of the pure - saddle fixed point @xmath71 , the solutions are linear combinations of real exponential functions .",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to the saddle - center fixed points , due to it rich topology .",
    "let us now analyze all possible motions in the linear neighborhood of the saddle - center point . as we have seen , dynamics in this neighborhood is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ normal ] ) .",

    "the separatrices @xmath86 are non - linear extensions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "orbits on such cylinders have the periodic orbits @xmath77 as their assymptotic limit @xmath89 .",
    "notice that those cylinders have the same energy as that of the unstable periodic orbits @xmath77 .",

    "the resulting motion of the system consists in hyperbolic orbits on the @xmath79 plane , as the projection of orbits on the @xmath97 plane is reduced to a single point defined by ( [ xxc ] ) .",
    "\\(c ) if @xmath98 and @xmath95 , the resultant motion is the direct product of hyperbolae related to the i , i@xmath99 , ii and ii@xmath99 regions of fig.[f5 ] , with the periodic orbits on the @xmath78 plane in the linear neigborhood of the saddle - center fixed point .",
    "we will analyze now the case of non - null constant external torques .",
    "there are still four fixed points , namely , @xmath100",
    "@xmath101    where @xmath102 and @xmath103 stand for the constant external torques . coordinates , from top to bottom , are ordered according to @xmath22 .",
    "the coordinates of those fixed points must be real ; hence , their existence is subject to the two simultaneous conditions : @xmath104 is a pure center , with corresponding energy @xmath105    in their turn , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are saddle - center points , with corresponding energy @xmath108    and    @xmath109    respectively .",
    "the fourth fixed point @xmath110 is a pure saddle , with energy    @xmath111    if @xmath112 , we fall into the null torques case , and the classification of those points is the same . in the special case",
    "@xmath113    it can be shown that all fixed points are degenerate , i.e. , the jacobian matrices of the linearized system in the neighborhood of those fixed points have all vanishing eigenvalues . in this case",
    ", a new procedure must be taken , so that at first this degenerescence is raised , and then the points are classified@xcite .",
    "we will not approach the degenerate case here .    from what has been seen above",
    ", the topology of orbits in the _ linear _ neighborhood of fixed points is the same for both the null - torques and non - null constant torques cases .    by the introduction of constant external torques",
    ", their intensity can be adjusted so that the robot arm be held any desired configuration in equilibrium .",
    "the majority of those equilibrium points are unstable , though : any fluctuation on the initial conditions can take the system out of equilibrium . in the case of the saddle - center points ,",
    "the choice of certain branches of the saddle can lead to stable equilibrium , even in the presence of fluctuations .",
    "we have proposed that the planar manipulator with two links and two rotational joins , a system with two degrees of freedom , be described by the hamiltonian of a double pendulum subject to two external torques . in its phase space ,",
    "four fixed points ( stationary solutions ) can be found ; a pure center , a pure saddle , and two saddle - centers , which can be used as a clue to the structure of orbits in in all phase space . we have also observed that there are two similar invariant manifolds , each one of them associated to a saddle - center points .",
    "the phase portrait of the system upon those manifolds resembles that of a mathematical pendulum of arbitrary amplitude .",
    "dynamics upon such manifolds is governed by a unidimensional autonomous system , thus being totally integrable . for any set of initial conditions placed on one such manifold ,",
    "the orbits will be confined to that manifold .",
    "we should keep in mind , however , that those manifolds are embedded into a four - dimensional phase space , so that the system in general in non - integrable .",
    "an important result is that for constant external torques , the phase space topology in the linear neighborhood of the fixed points is the same as that of the null - torques case , if certain conditions involving the torques and parameters of the system are satisfied . with a proper choice of torque intensities ,",
    "then , we may define any point in configuration space as a fixed point , without altering its nature , in relation to the null - torques case . in particular",
    ", the topology of orbits in the linear neighborhood of the saddle - center points is the same , as the existence of the corresponding invariant manifolds .    a possible continuation of this work involves the analysis of the non - linear neighborhood of fixed points .",
    "strong indications of chaotic behavior are expected , due to the non - integrability of the system .",
