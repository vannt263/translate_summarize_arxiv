    "in the spring of 1996 i was visiting the city college of new york for a month , in order to pursue a research project with stuart samuel , who was a professor at city university of new york at the time , and to run in the 100th boston marathon . several evenings and part of weekends",
    "i d spend with our mutual friend pascal gharemani , a tennis coach and instructor at trinity school ( a private high school on west 91st street in manhattan ) .",
    "typically we would go dining , visit places or fly kites .",
    "pascal had an iranian background but grew up in versailles near paris before moving to the us .",
    "my wife and i had come to know him during my postdoc years at city college ( 198790 ) , when we would meet weekly at various restaurants in the columbia university neighborhood for an evening of french conversation .",
    "he was important for our socialization in manhattan and had grown into a good friend .",
    "pascal was a very curious individual , with a great sense of humor and always ready to engage in discussions about savoir vivre , philosophy , and the natural sciences . regarding the latter , he regularly pondered phenomena and questions which involved physics . lacking a formal science training",
    ", he would go to great lengths and try his physicist friends for explanations .",
    "so one evening in 1996 he shared his musings about the gravitational force of a long and homogeneous rod , as it is felt by a ( say , minuscule ) creature crawling on its surface .",
    "clearly , the mass points in its neighborhood are mainly responsible for creating the force . on one hand , at the end of the rod , the nearby mass is fewer than elsewhere , but it is all pulling roughly in the same direction . on the other hand , around the middle part of the rod ,",
    "twice as much mass points are located near the creature , yet their gravitational forces point to almost opposing directions and hence tend to cancel each other out .",
    "so which location gives more weight to the mini - bug ?",
    "where along the rod is its surface gravity largest ?",
    "this was a typical ` pascal question ' , and my immediate response was : `` that s an easy one .",
    "let me just compute it . ''",
    "well , easier said then done . for the mid - rod position",
    "the resulting integrals were too tough to perform on the back of an envelope . to simplify my life , i persuaded pascal to modify the problem .",
    "let us vary not the position of the bug but the geometry of its planet : keep the bug sitting on the top of a cylinder , and compare a long rod with a slim disk of the same volume and mass .",
    "then it was not too hard to calculate the surface gravity as a function of the ratio of the cylinder s diameter to its length .",
    "to our surprise , in a narrow window of this parameter the weight of the bug exceeds the value for a spherical ball made from the same material .",
    "this finding inspired us to generalize the question to another level : given a bunch of homogeneous material ( fixed volume and density , hence total mass ) , for which shape is the gravitational force somewhere on its surface maximized ?",
    "thus , the idea of `` asteroid engineering '' was born .    after solving the problem and comparing the result with a few other geometries , i put the calculations aside and forgot about them .",
    "four years later , when teaching mathematical methods for physics freshmen , i was looking for a good student exercise in variational calculus . coming across my notes from 1996 ,",
    "i realized they can be turned into an unorthodox , charming and slightly challenging homework problem .",
    "and so i did , posing the challenge in the summer of 2000  @xcite and again in 2009  @xcite , admittedly with mixed success .",
    "but let the reader decide !",
    "it is textbook material how to compute the newtonian gravitational field  @xmath5 generated by a given three - dimensional static mass distribution  @xmath6 . in the absence of symmetry arguments ,",
    "it involves a three - dimensional integral collecting the contributions @xmath7 produced by the masses at positions @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting the gravitational constant . for the case of a solid homogeneous body  @xmath10 of volume  @xmath11 and total mass  @xmath12 ,",
    "clearly @xmath13 is constant , and one gets @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit vector pointing from the observer ( at @xmath16 ) to the mass point at  @xmath8 . the surface gravity ( specific weight of a probe ) located somewhere on the surface @xmath17 of my solid is obtained by simply restricting @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "one might think of simplifying the task by computing the gravitational potential rather than the field , since the corresponding integral is scalar and appears to be easier .",
    "however , evaluating the surface gravity then requires taking a gradient in the end and thus keeping at least an infinitesimal dependence on a coordinate normal to the surface . retaining this additional parameter until finally computing the derivative of the potential with respect to it before setting it to zero yields no calculational gain over a direct computation of  @xmath18 .",
    "the original question of pascal concerned a cylindrical rod , whose length and radius i denote by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , so that @xmath21 .",
    "the integral above has dimension of length , and i shall scale out a factor of  @xmath19 to pass to dimensionless quantities . for the remaining dimensionless parameter",
    "i choose the ratio of diameter to length of the cylinder , @xmath22 , see fig .  1 .",
    "i shall frequently have to express some of the four quantities @xmath20 ,",

    "apart from the linear dependence on the gravitational constant  @xmath9 and the mass density  @xmath35 , the surface gravity must carry a dimensional length factor , which choose to be the cylinder length  @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath19 , @xmath23 and @xmath11 are obviously related , and for comparing different shapes of the same mass and volume it is preferable to eliminate @xmath19 in favor of @xmath11 and  @xmath23 .",
