    "in recent years strong - interaction processes characterised by two large and disparate energy scales , which are typically the squared parton center - of - mass energy @xmath4 and the squared momentum transfer @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , have been analysed .",
    "these processes can be divided into two categories : @xmath7 inclusive processes , such as dijet production in hadron collisions at large rapidity intervals  @xcite , forward jet production in dis  @xcite , and @xmath8 collisions in double - tag events , @xmath9 hadrons  @xcite ; @xmath10 diffractive processes , such as dijet production with a rapidity gap between the tagging jets , either in hadron collisions  @xcite or in photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the interest in these processes stems from the possibility that their description in terms of perturbative - qcd calculations at a fixed order in the coupling constant @xmath11 might not be adequate , and that a resummation to all orders of @xmath11 of large contributions of the type of @xmath12 , performed through the bfkl equation  @xcite , might be needed .",
    "an additional motivation for the analysis of processes in the limit @xmath6 , and in particular for dijet production in hadron collisions at large rapidity intervals , inclusive or with a rapidity gap , is to use it as a test ground for the production of a higgs boson in association with jets at the lhc .",
    "a higgs boson is mainly produced via gluon fusion , @xmath13 , mediated by a top - quark loop .",
    "if the higgs - boson mass is above the threshold for vector - boson production , the higgs boson decays mostly into a pair of @xmath0 or @xmath14 bosons .",
    "the signal , though , is likely to be swamped by the @xmath15 , qcd and @xmath16 backgrounds .",
    "a higgs boson of such a mass is also produced in @xmath17 via electroweak - boson fusion , @xmath15 and @xmath18 , though at a smaller rate  @xcite .",
    "however , this would have a distinctive radiation pattern with a large gap in parton production in the central rapidity region , because the outgoing quarks give rise to forward jets in opposite directions  @xcite , with no colour exchanged between the parent quarks that emit the weak bosons  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the topology of the final state has been used to reduce the overwhelming @xmath19-jet background  @xcite .",
    "in fact , requiring in @xmath19-jet production two forward jets in opposite directions , which entails a large dijet invariant mass , makes the parton sub - processes to be dominated by gluon exchange in the crossed channel , with the w s produced forward in rapidity .    in this paper , we analyse forward @xmath0 production in association with jets as a natural extension of dijet production at hadron colliders and forward - jet production in dis , and as a process that for large dijet invariant masses shares the same dynamical features ( i.e. , gluon exchange in the crossed channel ) as @xmath20-jet production with forward jets , but is considerably simpler to analyse",
    ". there are additional reasons to consider this process : firstly , it could be experimentally easier to pick up forward @xmath0 bosons that decay leptonically than forward jets ; once a forward lepton has triggered the event , one observes the jets that are associated to it , with no limitations on their transverse energy .",
    "conversely , in a pure jet sample one usually triggers the event on a jet of relatively high transverse energy , thus the triggering jet can not be too forward .",
    "secondly , @xmath0 production in association with jets lends itself naturally to extensions to the high - energy limit , since it favours configurations with a forward @xmath0 boson , as we shall see in .",
    "we limit our analysis to @xmath0-boson production , however we expect the same kinematical and dynamical considerations we make in this work to apply to @xmath14-boson production as well .    in we examine the exact leading - order inclusive rapidity distributions for @xmath21-jet and @xmath22-jet production , for each parton subprocess , as well as the rapidity distribution of the @xmath0 boson when the rapidity interval between the two jets is large . in",
    "we review the high - energy factorisation and the derivation of the impact factor for jet production , and we calculate the impact factor for @xmath21-jet production . in",
    "we consider the rate for @xmath22-jet production in several high - energy approximations , and in we review the bfkl monte carlo event generator . in we",
    "analyse several distributions and candidate bfkl observables , such as the production rate as a function of the rapidity interval between the two jets , the azimuthal angle decorrelation and the mean number of jets .",
    "finally , in the last section we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we analyse in detail the kinematics of @xmath0 production in association with one or two jets , and we show that in @xmath23 colliders asymmetric configurations with a forward @xmath0 boson are naturally favoured . to include both @xmath24 and @xmath25 production . ] the results presented here have been obtained using tree - level matrix elements generated by madgraph  @xcite .",
    "we consider the hadroproduction of a @xmath0 boson with an associated jet . at leading order ( lo ) ,",
    "the parton subprocesses are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the momentum fractions of the incoming partons are given through energy - momentum conservation by x_a & = & |p_j_| e^y_j + m _",
    "e^ , + x_b & = & |p_j_| e^-y_j + m _",
    "e^- , [ wjkin ] with @xmath28 the jet ( and the @xmath0 ) transverse momentum and @xmath29 and in @xmath30 ? at proton - antiproton colliders ,",
    "the subprocess @xmath26 is leading ; since the incoming quark and antiquark are valence quarks and the up and the down quark distribution functions have different shapes , this entails an asymmetry in the rapidity distribution of @xmath24 versus @xmath25 bosons , both in fully inclusive ( drell - yan ) @xmath0 boson production  @xcite and in @xmath21-jet production , and accordingly a large plateau for the rapidity distribution of the @xmath0 boson as a whole .    also at proton - proton colliders ,",
    "the @xmath0 boson may be produced abundantly in the forward rapidity region .",
    "as in the @xmath31 rapidity asymmetry , the physical mechanism is the difference in the shape of the p.d.f.s of the incoming partons .",
    "in fact , to be definite let us consider the subprocess @xmath27 , which at proton - proton colliders is dominant , and suppose that the incoming gluon enters from the negative - rapidity direction while the quark enters from the positive - rapidity direction , so we can identify @xmath32 as the gluon and @xmath33 as the quark momentum fractions . the gluon distribution function is very steep , so it pays off to have @xmath32 as small as possible , which can be achieved by taking @xmath30 negative .",
    "that increases considerably the value of @xmath33 , however , because of the shape of the valence - quark distribution function , it can be achieved without paying a high price . in",
    ", we consider the rapidity distribution of the @xmath0 boson in @xmath21-jet production , broken up into its parton components .",
    "the renormalisation and factorisation scales , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are taken to be equal to @xmath36 . in",
    "we have taken the @xmath0 mass to be @xmath37 = 80.44 gev , we have used the p.d.f.s of the package mrst99cg and evolved @xmath11 accordingly  @xcite . applying the argument above to both the gluon incoming directions for @xmath27 , yields a broad rapidity distribution of the @xmath0 boson , a. the picture above applies to the subprocess @xmath26 too , b , since the antiquark is in this case a sea quark .    in case",
    "the @xmath0 boson is produced forward in rapidity , with which rapidity is the jet typically produced ?",
    "if the jet is produced in the opposite hemisphere with respect to the @xmath0 boson , the rapidity interval @xmath38 is large , however we know that in this case @xmath21-jet production is strongly suppressed ( at lo ) , since its parton subprocesses can only have quark exchange in the crossed channel , and thus the related production rate falls off with the parton centre - of - mass energy @xmath39 .",
    "thus this configuration is dynamically disfavoured . on the other hand , jet production in the same hemisphere as the @xmath0 boson or centrally in rapidity keeps @xmath32 small without substantially increasing @xmath33 .",
    "however , whether the jet is produced in the central region or in the same hemisphere as the @xmath0 boson depends on the detailed shape of the p.d.f.s , namely on how large we can afford to make @xmath33 while keeping @xmath32 small . in",

    "the subprocess @xmath45 is perfectly symmetric , thus the @xmath0 boson and the two jets are produced mostly in the central rapidity region .",
    "however , in the other subprocesses that is not the case : looking at the distributions in @xmath30 ( )    we see that as we move from @xmath46 to @xmath47 the @xmath0 boson tends to be produced more and more forward in rapidity .",
    "examining the distributions in @xmath48 ( ) ,    where @xmath49 is the jet that is closest to the @xmath0 , we see that this jet tends to follow the @xmath0 in rapidity . from the distributions in @xmath50 ( )",
    ",    we see that in @xmath46 and @xmath51 jet 1 tends to be produced more centrally ; in @xmath47 it follows the @xmath0 boson and jet 2 , thus emphasizing the kinematical features already noted in @xmath21-jet production ( the twin peaks observed in in @xmath46 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 are due to requiring two jets with interjet distance @xmath52 0.4 ) ; finally in @xmath53 it tends to be produced far in rapidity from the @xmath0 boson and jet 2 .    to understand how these configurations come about",

    "the @xmath0 boson is produced forward ( ) .",
    "note that with respect to this is made easier by the presence of two jets , which let the @xmath0 boson have a transverse momentum as small as kinematically possible : ultimately , when the jets are balanced in transverse momentum , the @xmath0 transverse mass reduces to the mass , @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , one jet , say @xmath49 , is always linked to the @xmath0 boson via a quark propagator as in @xmath21-jet production , so it tends to follow the @xmath0 in rapidity , as in , however the position of the other jet is a dynamical feature peculiar of @xmath22-jet production : thanks to the gluon exchanged in the crossed channel , that jet can be easily separated in rapidity from the @xmath0 boson . in @xmath56 ,",
    "the kinematical mechanism is the same as in @xmath54 since the antiquark has a sea quark p.d.f .",
    ", however only @xmath57 can have a gluon exchanged in the crossed channel . for @xmath45 , which has equal p.d.f.s for the incoming particles and no gluon exchanged in the crossed channel , we obtain a central distribution , as expected .",
    "note , however , that in and following the contribution of @xmath45 to @xmath22-jet production is quite small .",
    "the @xmath58 channel is peculiar , since the largest contribution comes from valence - quark distributions , which tend to have rather large @xmath59 s .",
    "in addition , at the dynamical level it features only diagrams with gluon exchange in the crossed channel . thus to make one @xmath59 large , it tends to have the @xmath0 boson and a jet slightly forward in rapidity , while to make the other @xmath59 large , it has the second jet well forward ( and opposite ) in rapidity .",
    "next , we require that the two jets are produced with a sizeable rapidity interval , @xmath60 , and look at the rapidity distribution of the @xmath0 boson with respect to the jet average , @xmath61 ( ) .    now",
    "the requirement that the rapidity interval between the jets is large makes the subprocesses with gluon exchange in the crossed channel stand out even more , and the @xmath0 boson , which is linked to one of the jets by quark exchange in the crossed channel , to follow that jet in rapidity .",
    "this is stressed by the double peaks in @xmath51 , @xmath53 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that the dip between the peaks is maximal for @xmath58 , which features only diagrams with gluon exchange in the crossed channel .",
    "conversely @xmath45 yields the @xmath0 boson in the central rapidity region and approximately equidistant from the two jets , however it is strongly suppressed since it can only have quark exchange in the crossed channel .",
    "the plots of are characterised by the dominance of the subprocesses featuring gluon exchange in the crossed channel .",
    "the same feature is exhibited by events where we select the jet , say @xmath62 , that in rapidity is furthest away from the @xmath0 , require that @xmath63 , and examine the distribution in @xmath64 . since in this case",
    "@xmath49 is always linked to the @xmath0 boson by quark exchange , the distributions are all centered about zero .",
    "the leading subprocesses factorise then naturally into two scattering centres : an impact factor for @xmath21-jet production , and an impact factor for jet production .",
    "the two impact factors are connected by the gluon exchanged in the crossed channel .",
    "accordingly , the dashed lines of fig .  [ fig : w2jetywy1y2 ] have been obtained by taking the high - energy limit of the amplitudes featuring crossed - channel gluon exchange ( see ) . on these amplitudes",
    "we can then insert the universal leading - logarithmic corrections of @xmath65 , and resum them through the bfkl equation .",

    "the impact factor for @xmath21-jet production is derived in .",
    "next , we summarise jet production at hadron colliders in the high - energy limit .",
    "in order to show how to extract the lo impact factor for @xmath21-jet production , we use as a paradigm parton - parton scattering , and the derivation of the lo impact factor for jet production .      in the high - energy limit @xmath6 , the bfkl theory assumes that any scattering process is dominated by gluon exchange in the crossed channel , which for a given scattering occurs at @xmath66 .",
    "this constitutes the leading - order ( lo ) term of the bfkl resummation .",
    "the corresponding qcd amplitude factorizes into a gauge - invariant effective amplitude formed by two scattering centers , the lo impact factors , connected by the gluon exchanged in the crossed channel .",
    "the lo impact factors are characteristic of the scattering process at hand .",
    "the bfkl equation resums then the universal leading - logarithmic ( ll ) corrections , of @xmath67 , to the gluon exchange in the crossed channel .",
    "these are obtained in the limit of a strong rapidity ordering of the emitted gluon radiation , y_1y_2  y_n-1y_n .[mrk ]    for an arbitrary scattering , the lo term of the bfkl resummation is contained in the higher - order terms of the expansion in @xmath11 . for dijet production in hadron collisions , the lo term of the bfkl resummation is already included in the lo term of the expansion in @xmath11 . in this respect , dijet production in hadron collisions at large rapidity intervals is the simplest process to which to apply the bfkl resummation , and thus we shall use it as a paradigm .",
    "since the cross section for dijet production in the high - energy limit is dominated by gluon exchange in the crossed channel , the functional form of the qcd amplitudes for gluon - gluon , gluon - quark or quark - quark scattering at lo is the same ; they differ only by the colour strength in the parton - production vertices .",
    "we can then write the cross section , @xmath68 in the following factorised form  @xcite @xmath69 where x_a^0 = |p_a_| e^y_a,x_b^0 = |p_b_| e^-y_b,[nkin0 ] are the parton momentum fractions in the high - energy limit , @xmath70 and @xmath71 label the forward and backward outgoing jet , respectively , and the effective parton distribution functions are @xmath72 , \\label{effec}\\ ] ] where the sum is over the quark flavours . in the high - energy limit",

    "the quantities in square brackets are proportional to the impact factors for jet production .",
    "we shall analyse them in .",
    "the function @xmath80 is the green s function associated with the gluon exchanged in the crossed channel .",
    "it is process independent and given in the ll approximation by the solution of the bfkl equation .",
    "its analytic form is , f(q_a_,q_b_,y ) = 1(2)^2    with @xmath81 the azimuthal angle between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and @xmath84 the eigenvalue of the bfkl equation with maximum at @xmath85 .",

    "in addition , in the high - energy limit the impact factors for @xmath21-jet production on one side and for jet production on the other can be viewed as two almost independent scattering centres linked by a gluon exchanged in the crossed channel , thus it makes sense to run @xmath11 according to the scale set by each impact factor .",

    "secondly , the implementation of the kinematic constraint ( [ exkin ] ) in the bfkl monte carlo , rather than using @xmath213 ( [ sigmaw ] ) in the high - energy limit , has a much lesser impact than in the dijet case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the valence quark distribution in @xmath157 is much less sensitive to @xmath59 variations than the gluon distribution in @xmath228 .",

    ". the decorrelation between the tagging jets has been analysed , and indeed observed , by the d0 collaboration in dijet production at the tevatron collider  @xcite .",
    "however , the bfkl - induced radiation predicts a stronger decorrelation than the data , even though the bfkl monte carlo  @xcite shows a much more realistic azimuthal decorrelation than the bfkl analytic solution .",
    "the data are correctly reproduced by the herwig monte carlo generator  @xcite , which includes parton showers and hadronization .",
    "this suggests that the azimuthal angle decorrelation @xmath234 , picking up preferentially configurations where the tagged jets are back to back , is sensitive to threshold configurations , and thus to logarithms of sudakov type , even more than it is in the inclusive dijet production rate @xmath212  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in the paragraph above , in @xmath22-jet production we expect the logarithms of sudakov type to play a much less significant role .",
