    "the minuscular universe of high energy - density and temperature , immediately after the big bang , evolved through a state of an exotic phase of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , that survived for some microseconds only .",
    "the qgp - the plasma state in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite , the theory of strong interaction - can be created also in the laboratory @xcite , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . the formation of the qcd plasma necessitates accomplishment of thermodynamic equilibrium . in heavy - ion collisions , the local thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed to obtain the equation of state for the space - time evolution of the system in the framework of the relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "eventually , the formation of qgp in heavy - ion collisions is established mainly by characterizing the system in the hydrodynamic model , implying occurrence of the qcd phase - change .",
    "the proton - proton ( @xmath2 ) collision , on the other hand , is considered as the elementary interaction by most of the topical models which do not endorse formation of any medium , whatsoever .",
    "one may also question if the mean free path of the constituent particles , the size and the lifetime of the produced medium , if any , in @xmath2 collisions are conducive to the formation of qgp or not .",
    "nevertheless , the recent data of @xmath2 collisions , particularly for the high - multiplicity events , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern show certain features @xcite , which are typical of the hydrodynamic medium formed in the relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "several of subsequent phenomenological studies with the lhc @xmath2 data indicate the formation @xcite of collective medium .",
    "further , while some theoretical approaches@xcite support applicability of relativistic hydrodynamics in high multiplicity @xmath2 collisions , formation of a non - hadronic medium has been shown @xcite to be energetically possible in @xmath2 collisions at the lhc . a study @xcite in search for the change in phase in @xmath2 collisions , analyzing a wide range of centre - of - mass energy , includes the lhc data also .",
    "the prima facie observations from all these studies in @xmath2 collisions at the lhc are quite encouraging for one to follow the approach adopted in search for the qgp in heavy - ion collisions - assume local thermal equilibrium and search for signals for formation of qgp or equivalently the qcd phase - change .",
    "we analyze the data of @xmath2 collisions at the lhc to search for a signal of change of phase , in qcd , from thermalized partonic matter to hadronic one , in terms of change in effective number of degrees of freedom of the system formed in the collision , as a function of temperature .",
    "the signal has been predicted @xcite by the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) , the well accepted tool for non - perturbative calculations in qcd .",
    "the lqcd - predicted signal for the phase transition or for the crossover in high energy heavy - ion and @xmath2 collisions calls for a fast rise of @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is temperature , @xmath6 is the energy - density and @xmath7 is the entropy - density of the system ) over a small change in temperature , reflecting rapid increase in the effective number of degrees of freedom indicating a change in phase . while a sharp , step - like increase manifests the first order phase transition , a smooth but rapid rise indicates either the crossover or a second order phase transition .",
    "the lattice qcd simulation is continuously progressing @xcite towards more realistic calculations , in terms of number of quark flavors and their masses , minimization of lattice spacings etc .",
    "the latest lqcd calculations result in a crossover@xcite in the qcd transition . at temperature lower than the critical region of rapid rise",
    ", the system is populated mainly by pions , forming a hadron gas . in this temperature range , however , the lattice calculation of @xmath6 and so @xmath7 is difficult as they are exponentially suppressed@xcite . at temperature higher than the critical region , where the ideal gas limit of degrees of freedom is reached asymptotically",
    ", the system corresponds to ideal gas consisting of partons . in absence of a straightforward method of estimation of temperature from data , the predicted behavior of temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as a signal for the phase transition or",
    "the crossover is still a far from convincing experimental verification even for the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "adding to the complexity , in the real - life scenario of experiments , the finite size effect@xcite of the system formed in the collision , may cause widening of the width of transition or smoothening of singularities in the lqcd - predicted dependence of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the experimental search for the phase transition or for the crossover in the data of high energy collisions involves connecting thermodynamical variables with measurable observables . the rapidity density , @xmath8 , ( where @xmath9 = the number of charged hadrons , the rapidity , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the energy and longitudinal component of momentum of a particle ) or the pseudorapidity density , @xmath13 , ( where the pseudorapidity , @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 is the polar angle of the particle with respect to the beam direction ) and the transverse momentum , @xmath16 , of produced charged hadrons are primary measurable observables in high energy experiments which are connected to thermodynamic variables involved in the lqcd - predicted signal for the change in phase .    according to the relativistic hydrodynamics , the rapidity or",
    "the pseudorapidity density reflects the entropy - density ( @xmath7 ) created early in the collision .",
    "the @xmath7 depends only on the initial energy - density ( @xmath6 ) and remains constant throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even for @xmath17 , the @xmath6 has been shown@xcite to be sufficient for formation of a non - hadronic medium in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath18 = 7 tev .",
    "the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment has recorded @xcite sufficient statistics of high multiplicity @xmath2 events with @xmath19 going up to @xmath20 , providing a wide range of data to look for effects of variation in observables involving energy - density . as the objective of this study does not include evaluation of the absolute value of the energy - density ,",
    "the following simple formalism @xcite as proposed by bjorken could be sufficient for estimation of the energy - density :    @xmath21    where , @xmath22 is the effective volume occupied by the particles and is given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the interaction area and @xmath25 , a longitudinal dimension , considered to be about 1@xmath26 in bjorken model .",
    "the estimate of entropy density , therefore , comes as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the radius of the interaction area .     as a function of mass of identified particles ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , obtained from the measured transverse momentum spectra from non - single diffractive events of @xmath2 collisions as measured by the cms experiment @xcite at @xmath18 = 7 tev .",
    "@xmath33 is the mean multiplicity of charged particles .",
    "the solid lines drawn joining the data points are to guide the eye . ]",
    "the low @xmath16 part of the @xmath16 - spectra of produced particles from high energy collisions contain information on temperature as well as on transverse expansion of the system . as disentangling the effect of the temperature and the contribution from the transverse expansion in the @xmath16 - spectra",
    "is not possible , instead of exclusive measure of temperature , experimental analysis deal with parameters that reflect the temperature of the system .",
    "either the mean transverse momentum , ( @xmath34 ) , as proposed @xcite by van hove , or the slope of the transverse mass ( @xmath35 ) - spectra , obtained from the @xmath16 - spectra ( for a particle of mass @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , can be used for comparing thermal states of the system .",
    "the investigation of the lqcd predicted signal for change in phase in terms of effective number of degrees of freedom in @xmath2 collisions has been studied @xcite in terms of the @xmath34 dependence of @xmath38 . on the other hand , the @xmath35 - spectra corresponding to low - @xmath16 particles are usually satisfactorily fitted with exponential function of the form , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is known as the inverse slope parameter .",
    "increase in inverse slope parameter , @xmath40 with mass , @xmath36 , for the most commonly measured identified particles ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , as has been observed @xcite in heavy - ion collisions as well as in the recent @xmath45 collisions @xcite at cern is a well known phenomenon , attributed to the collective transverse flow of the medium formed in the collision .",
    "the cms experiment at the lhc has measured @xmath16-spectra @xcite of pions ( @xmath41 ) , kaons ( @xmath42 ) , and protons ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) over the rapidity range @xmath47 for the @xmath2 collisions at @xmath18 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev for several event classes selected on the basis of mean number of charged particles , @xmath33 in the pseudo - rapidity interval , @xmath48 or , in other words , as a function of pseudorapidity density , @xmath19 , reflecting `` centrality '' in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the measured @xmath16 - ranges are ( 0.1 to 1.2 ) gev / c for @xmath41 , ( 0.2 to 1.050 ) gev / c for @xmath42 and ( 0.35 - 1.7 ) gev / c for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , by measuring the @xmath19 - dependent identified particle spectra , the cms experiment provides the unique opportunity to study the lqcd - predicted signal on change in phase in terms of the change in degrees of freedom in @xmath2 collisions at the lhc energies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same set of data , on analysis @xcite in the hydrodynamics motivated boltzman - gibbs blast - wave model @xcite , revealed collective transverse flow for the high multiplicity events . to check if the previously observed indication of the formation of collective medium in @xmath2 collisions is revealed in the statistical model also , we look for the mass dependence of inverse slope parameter by fitting the @xmath35 - spectra ( with the @xmath49 values in the range 0.3 - 2.48 for pions , 0.26 - 1.08 for kaons and 0.06 - 4.92 for protons ) of identified particles obtained from the @xmath16 - spectra data @xcite at @xmath18 = 7 tev measured by the cms experiment . to avoid the effect of resonance",
    "decays , the pions with @xmath16 < 0.45 gev / c were excluded from the fitting - range .",
    "the increase of @xmath40 with mass of identified particles for event classes of high @xmath33 reiterates ( figure  [ fig : massordering ] ) the finding of collective medium in high - multiplicity @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the collectivity , however , does not confirm formation of the qgp or the qcd phase - change .    , the effective number of degrees of freedom , as a function of the transverse momentum , @xmath34 , of pions as obtained from the measured @xcite spectra data .",
    "the solid lines drawn joining the data points are to guide the eye .",

    "the solid lines drawn joining the data points are to guide the eye .",
    "the error bars include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties . ]    to characterize the collective medium so formed , we study the @xmath34 - dependence of @xmath38 , the effective number of degrees of freedom of the system formed in the collisions . in the study , we also take into consideration some model dependent estimations @xcite of the effect due to the transverse expansion on @xmath34 to facilitate the study and the interpretation thereof . a model calculation @xcite of @xmath34 as a function of the temperature for various hadron species",
    "show that the change in the shape of the @xmath16 - spectra or in the value of @xmath34 due to the transverse expansion is dependent on the individual hadron species of different mass - while the protons gain most in @xmath34 , the pions lose some @xmath34 .",
    "according to another model calculation @xcite , the protons gain additional @xmath34 as the protons decouple from the fireball after pions , experiencing larger flow - effect .",
    "being weakly affected @xcite by re - scattering of hadrons and resonance decay , kaons are better observable in the search for change in phase . we , therefore , argue that instead of the @xmath34 of several particles together , containing cumulative effect due to the transverse expansion of varying magnitude , the @xmath34 of individual species may be more meaningful in reflecting temperature related characteristics of the system .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath38 on the @xmath34 for charged pions and charged kaons from the @xmath2 collisions at @xmath18 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev , separately , as kaons have been suggested @xcite to be a better observable particles and the charged pions , constituting the majority of the produced charged particles , grossly dominate the average behavior of all charged particles . to calculate the entropy density ,",
    "@xmath7 following bjorken s formalism @xcite , the radius of interaction area , @xmath30 , is estimated from the hbt- radius @xcite that has dependence on the pair transverse momentum ( @xmath50 ) and multiplicity . for a given @xmath51",
    ", high @xmath50 corresponds to the early stage of the collision , while low @xmath50 relates the final stage , close to the freeze - out , and includes the effect of particle activities in the transverse direction during the expansion .",
    "we use the radii for the highest @xmath50 - range ( 0.5 to 1.0 gev / c ) , as measured @xcite by the cms experiment , to parameterize the radius of interaction as a function of @xmath33 , as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 fm .",
    "both the pions and the kaons show more or less smooth but rapid rise in @xmath38 , indicating release of new degrees of freedom , over a small change of @xmath34 in the lower @xmath34 - range .",
    "significantly , however , the dependence of @xmath38 at high @xmath34 is different for pions and kaons .",
    "a change of phase can not be concluded from the plots in figure  [ fig : sigmabyptcube_pi ] for the pions , because of the missing saturation effect at high @xmath34 - range . for kaons at high @xmath34 , reflecting high temperature , the saturation in @xmath38 , as depicted in figure  [ fig : sigmabyptcube_k ] , indicates that the highest possible number of degrees of freedom , corresponding to the partonic phase , is reached .",
    "different responses by pions and kaons is rather consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the loss of @xmath34 for pions @xcite could be the reason for the disappearance of the saturation effect of @xmath38 at high @xmath16 , corresponding to the high multiplicity @xmath2 events .",
    "also , the differential freeze - out of hadron species as a consequence of different elastic cross - sections @xcite may lead to the early kaon - freeze - out as compared to the pion - freeze - out and may provide an alternate explanation to the observed difference in response by the pions and the kaons . in case of early freeze - out ,",
    "the kaons are likely to be less affected by the flow , that develops with time .",
    "the shape of the kaon @xmath16 -spectrum , therefore , may largely retain the effect of the temperature of the system formed in high energy collisions .",
    "one needs to note that , as the @xmath34 only reflects the @xmath5 and does not give absolute measure of @xmath5 , the @xmath38 also reflects the effective number of degrees of freedom and not necessarily quantitatively match @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath34 for the kaons reveals the qualitative feature of the lqcd - predicted signal for the change in phase of matter formed in @xmath2 collisions in terms of change from high to low degrees of freedom with decreasing @xmath34 , the temperature - related observable .",
    "importantly , the nature of the experimental finding of the change in phase matches the results of the latest lqcd calculations predicting a crossover @xcite .",
    ", as a function of number of charged - particle multiplicity , @xmath9 , as measured by alice @xcite is compared with the simulated events using pythia8 tune 4c generators .",
    "the large statistical uncertainties correspond to only ten thousand simulated events of each class . ]",
    "as the analysis reveals a new feature in the @xmath2 data , comparing the results with the conventional monte carlo event generators is virtually obligatory .",
    "the standard event generators in use , however , have several versions tuned to explain different features of the lhc data . in that respect ,",
    "we find the pythia8.1 tune 4c , that , besides some other features , explains @xcite the @xmath34 - dependence on @xmath33 in @xmath2 collisions as measured by alice , to be relevant to compare the findings .",
    "it is important to mention that alice finds @xcite that the @xmath34 - dependence on @xmath33 for charged hadrons in @xmath2 collisions , in the @xmath16 - range up to 10 gev / c , is well described by pythia8.1 tune 4c by revoking color reconnection ( cr ) , while generated events without cr do not reproduce the dependence .",
    "the cr phenomenon was introduced in the multiple partonic interaction ( mpi ) models to explain the increasing trend of @xmath34 as a function of produced charged particles in @xmath2 or @xmath54 collisions . according to the mpi models , in high multiplicity events , the multiparticle production results from a large number of mpis . in cr mechanism ,",
    "the final state partons from different mpis get connected by color strings which follow the movements of the partonic end - points , resulting a transverse - boost in the string fragmentation process .",
    "the effect is manifested in the observed dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath9 .",
    "particle production of independent mpis is expected to result flat @xmath34 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "using the pythia8.1 tune 4c , we generate @xmath2 events at @xmath55 7 tev , with both the options , cr - on and cr - off and plot in figure  [ fig : alice_setup ] , basically reproducing the alice plots . as the alice data of charged hadrons in the @xmath16 - range up to 10 gev / c is consistent with the pythia8.1 tune 4c generated events , we compare the multiplicity dependent @xmath34 for the pions and the kaons spectra from the simulated events with the measured @xcite spectra that have been used in this work .",
    "we plot @xmath34 as a function of @xmath33 as obtained from the cms data @xcite ( within @xmath48 , while the @xmath16 - ranges are ( 0.1 to 1.2 ) gev / c for @xmath41 , ( 0.2 to 1.050 ) gev / c for @xmath42 ) and from the generated events with cr - on and cr - off .",
    "as it is clear from the figure  [ fig : meanptvsnch_pik ] , though the cr in the particular pythia tune , in use , gives the boost in the @xmath16 of the produced particles , it is far from the measured ones in the given kinematic ranges , for all the event - classes depending on @xmath33 . in spite of this mismatch , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we repeat our analysis related to the lqcd prediction on the simulated events with the cr - on . the obvious mismatch between the data and the simulated events with color reconnection",
    "is depicted in figure  [ fig : sigmabyptcube_simpik ] .",
    "it is important to note at this point that the temperature of a thermalized partonic medium , if formed , should ideally be reflected by the low - @xmath16 particles ( usually @xmath56 2 gev / c , as has been considered in heavy - ion collisions ) and the cms data meet the criterion .",
    ", as a function of mean charged - particle multiplicity , @xmath33 , as measured by cms @xcite is compared with the simulated events using pythia8 tune 4c generators with color reconnection on for @xmath2 collisions at @xmath57 7 tev .",

    "the error bars include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "]      the observation from the analysis of the identified spectra data of @xmath2 collisions motivates us to analyze the identified spectra data of @xmath1 ( @xmath45 ) collisions @xcite at @xmath58 = 5.02 tev following similar methodology , for comparison .",
    "we choose the @xmath45 data for comparison because of stronger evidence of collectivity @xcite in the ppb collisions .",
    "besides , availability of identified particle spectra data for different class of @xmath45 events depending on the pseudorapidity density ( similar classification as in @xmath2 collisions ) and remarkably similar @xcite @xmath9 - dependence of radii in all @xmath50 bins for the @xmath2 and @xmath45 collisions allow comparison on the same footings .",
    "as can be seen in the figure  [ fig : sigmabyptcube_pik_ppb ] , the @xmath45 data reveals similar features as exhibited by the @xmath2 data , though the effect of saturation of @xmath38 for kaons becomes weaker .    , the effective number of degrees of freedom , as a function of the mean transverse momentum , @xmath34 , for pions and kaons as obtained from the measured @xcite spectra data from @xmath45 collisions at 5.02 tev . the solid lines drawn joining the data points are to guide the eye .",

    "the search for thermalized partonic matter in the so - called elementary ( @xmath2 or @xmath59 ) interactions is not new .",
    "prior to lhc also , there have been several studies @xcite , addressing the de - confinement and formation of hydrodynamic medium in @xmath59 collisions .",
    "this study reveals an indication of possible change of phase in @xmath2 collision data in terms of change in effective number of degrees of freedom of the system . on the issue of thermal equilibrium",
    ", one can assume that the measured final state particle multiplicity in high - multiplicity @xmath2 events at lhc , being comparable @xcite with that in @xmath60 collisions at @xmath61 = 200 gev at rhic , may be adequate enough to fulfill the condition .",
    "we emphasize that the observed dependence of the degrees of freedom on @xmath34 at large values , equivalent to high temperature , corresponds to the high multiplicity @xmath2 events .",
    "it is noteworthy that the liberation of effective number of degrees of freedom for a given pseudorapidity density and for a given @xmath16 - range , is independent of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "summarily , the analysis of the data of @xmath2 collisions at the lhc , in terms of the nature of dependence of @xmath38 , the effective number of degrees of freedom , on @xmath34 , reflecting the temperature of the system , as measured from the @xmath16 - spectra of charged kaons , corroborates with the lqcd - calculation on change in phase .",
    "we repeat that though the qcd predicted change of phase has experimentally been proved @xcite in heavy - ion collisions by characterizing the medium formed after collisions , the experimental verification of the lqcd - calculated signal for the change of phase in terms of change in degrees of freedom in still not convincingly established .",
    "this may be naively attributed to the dampening effect due the collective behavior of the large - size fireball formed in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "that way , the @xmath16 - spectra of particles produced in a smaller fireball formed in @xmath2 collision may appear to be a befitting system for the search of the lqcd - calculated signal .",
    "also , the species - dependent response of the behavior of change in effective number of degrees of freedom , as has been revealed from this study , may become an useful tool in search for the lqcd - predicted signal in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "while the finding can not definitely be considered as the `` smoking gun '' on the change of phase in @xmath2 collisions , it certainly reveals a new feature , significant enough in furthering the study in search of the collective medium in high - multiplicity @xmath2 events and in characterization of such medium at higher lhc energies , scheduled in the run - ii of the lhc in 2015 .",
