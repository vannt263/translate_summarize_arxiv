    "observations of detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) with at least one low - mass component ( @xmath0 ) have shown , quite convincingly , that stellar evolution models do a poor job of predicting fundamental properties of low - mass stars ( e.g. , ribas @xcite , feiden & chaboyer @xcite ) .",
    "models routinely under predict radii and over predict effective temperatures by approximately 4% and 3% , respectively .",
    "it is often suggested that the interaction of stellar magnetic fields with thermal convection belies these noted discrepancies ( e.g. , mullan & macdonald @xcite , chabrier   @xcite ) .",
    "support is lent to this suggestion by the observation that magnetic activity indicators appear to correlate with radius discrepancies ( e.g. , lpez - morales @xcite , feiden & chaboyer @xcite ) .",
    "we have recently initiated an effort to test this hypothesis using the dartmouth stellar evolution code ( dotter  @xcite , feiden & chaboyer @xcite ) . in these proceedings",
    ", we will highlight some current results of this effort and discuss what we feel are key observations to identify the mechanism causing these discrepancies .",
    "effects of a magnetic field have been incorporated into the dartmouth stellar evolution code in a self - consistent manner ( feiden & chaboyer @xcite ) . at the moment , magneto - convection",
    "is included using two different prescriptions ( feiden & chaboyer @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". we will refer to them as : ( 1 ) stabilization of convection , and ( 2 ) inhibition of convective efficiency .",
    "stabilization of convection refers to a self - consistent modification to the schwarzschild stability criterion that is brought about by assuming the magnetic field is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding plasma .",
    "it is similar in effect to magneto - convection implemented by mullan & macdonald ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second method , inhibition of convective efficiency , assumes that the energy required to create a magnetic field is drained from kinetic energy in convection ( see feiden & chaboyer @xcite for details ) .",
    "physically , it can be likened to reduced convective mixing length methods ( e.g. , chabrier  @xcite ) .",
    "we will now highlight general conclusions drawn from applying the aforementioned magnetic stellar evolution models to a small number of well characterized debs .",
    "a full account of the results for each individual system can be found elsewhere ( feiden & chaboyer @xcite , 2014 in prep . ) . here , we will speak broadly about two classes of low - mass stars : partially convective and fully convective , where the former are defined to have a convective envelope and radiative core .",
    "only radius inflation will be discussed , but effective temperatures have been considered when reliable measurements are available .",
    "uncertainties and the vertical region marks the estimated age.,title=\"fig : \" ]   uncertainties and the vertical region marks the estimated age.,title=\"fig : \" ]    an example of magneto - convection s impact on model radius predictions for partially convective stars is given in figure[fig : yy_gem ] .",
    "it is quite clear from both panels that magneto - convection can provide a proper solution , at least qualitatively .",
    "model radii are forced to grow larger in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "notice , however , that the two magneto - convection techniques yield different surface magnetic field strengths . in the left panel",
    ", we see that stabilization of convection requires a surface magnetic field strength of 4.3 kg whereas inhibition of convective efficiency ( right panel ) only requires a 0.7 kg surface magnetic field strength .",
    "these two values can be compared to surface magnetic field strength estimates derived from the observed x - ray luminosity . in general ,",
    "magneto - convection manifested as inhibition of convective efficiency produces field strengths in better agreement with x - ray luminosity estimates ( feiden & chaboyer @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that magnetic fields are inflating partially convective stars .     for the fully convective stars of cm dra .",
    "( _ left _ ) models invoking the stabilization of convection .",
    "( _ right _ ) models that have inhibited convective efficiency.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the fully convective stars of cm dra .",
    "( _ left _ ) models invoking the stabilization of convection .",
    "( _ right _ ) models that have inhibited convective efficiency.,title=\"fig : \" ]    fully convective stars appear more stubborn in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig : cm_dra ] shows that a qualitatively correct solution can only be found when using stabilization of convection and a strong , nearly 6.0 kg surface magnetic field strength .",
    "inhibition of convective inefficiency , on the other hand , has only a small effect on model radius predictions , even when assuming that 99.99% of the kinetic energy in convection is converted to magnetic energy .",
    "it is important to note that the surface magnetic field strengths used in the two methods are only different by a factor of two ( 6.0 kg versus 3.0 kg ) , but the interior magnetic field strengths differ by nearly three orders of magnitude ( 50 mg versus 50 kg , respectively ) !",
    "we have strong doubts about the existence of 50 mg interior magnetic fields . a 50 kg magnetic field",
    "is easily obtained when the magnetic field comes into equipartition with convective flows .",
    "however , we have shown that inhibition of convective efficiency is unable to produce agreement in the mass - radius plane .",
    "additional discussion concerning magnetically induced radius inflation in fully convective stars is presented in an upcoming publication ( feiden & chaboyer 2014 , in prep . ) , where we argue against the idea that magnetic fields are inflating fully convective stars .",
    "instead of magnetic fields inflating fully convective stars , we suggest that observed discrepancies are related to metallicity , as is shown in figure [ fig : feh_resid ] .",
    "confirmation of this trend is required , which will require considerable effort to accurately determine deb metallicities .",
    "some relief may come from systems where the primary star is an f , g , or k - dwarf . additionally , direct measurements of surface magnetic field strengths on well - studied debs would help confirm or falsify model predictions . finally",
    ", reliable methods for deriving star spot properties are urgently needed .",
