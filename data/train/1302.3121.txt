    "in the past year , much progress has been made in identifying a new ( interacting ) class of states of matter ",
    "the so - called `` symmetry protected topological states '' ( spts)@xcite .",
    "topological insulators and superconductors are nice examples of spts .",
    "spts possess energy gaps in the bulk of the system and do not break any symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "they have symmetry protected gapless boundary excitations . in ref.@xcite it is argued that different spts are labeled by the elements of the cohomology group associated with the symmetry of the system .",
    "there are a number of outstanding issues that need to be understood in this new field .",
    "the subject of this paper concerns the critical theory of phase transition between these states .    in traditional statistical physics phases of matter are characterized by symmetries , and phase transitions mark the change in symmetry@xcite .",
    "they are described by the theory of ginzburg - landau@xcite and wilson @xcite .",
    "in contrast , different spts have the same symmetry but differ in the way symmetry is represented by their boundary excitations .",
    "a natural question is what differentiates the critical points between different spts and the usual ginzburg - landau - wilson critical points .",
    "a less obvious but equally natural question is what is the relation between the theories for such critical points and the theories of gapless excitations at the boundary of spts .    on the surface , it seems unjustified to expect a relationship between a bulk critical theory and a boundary theory , since they live in different space dimensions .",
    "the reason we expect such a relationship is the following physical picture for the gapless excitations at the boundary of non - trivial spts .",
    "vacuum is a trivial spt , it can not be connected to the nontrivial spt in the bulk without crossing a phase transition .",
    "now consider varying a parameter smoothly from inside to outside the sample so that the system evolves from a non - trivial spt to the trivial spt .",
    "the necessary phase transition then gives rise to the gapless excitations near the boundary . according to this picture _",
    "the gapless boundary of a non - trivial spt is the bulk critical theory spatially confined between two different spts . _    for free fermion spts@xcite",
    ", it is a simple exercise to see that the above picture is indeed true . in brief , the trivial and non - trivial spts are produced by adding `` mass '' of different signs to the critical theory .",
    "boundary corresponds to the mass domain wall , in the presence of which only momentum parallel to the interface is conserved .",
    "the gap node(s ) in the boundary theory can be obtained from those of the bulk critical theory with the component of momentum perpendicular to the interface deleted .",
    "it is much less clear how the picture works out for interacting spts .    in this paper , we study two examples of spt phase transitions in interacting systems , that between the @xmath0 spts in one dimension ( with @xmath1 classification ) and the one between @xmath2 spts in two dimension ( with @xmath3 classification ) .",
    "we see from these examples that ( 1 ) when subjected to appropriate boundary conditions the critical theory possesses the delocalized version of edge excitations ( 2 ) the edge theory is the bulk critical theory spatially confined between two spts , as is the case for free fermion systems .",
    "we expect these results to apply to general critical theories of phase transitions between spts , in any dimension and with any symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ so(3)_1d ]",
    ", we study the phase transition between the @xmath4 spts with @xmath0 symmetry and its relation to the degenerate edge state .",
    "section [ su(2)_2d ] is then devoted to @xmath5 spts with @xmath2 symmetry where the critical theory for phase transition is connected to the gapless edge states through the coupled wire construction of the spts .",
    "while in section [ su(2)_2d ] we focus mainly on the phase transition between vacuum and the first nontrivial spt in the @xmath3 classification , in section [ stacked_layer ] we discuss how the critical theory between vacuum and other nontrivial spts can be obtained starting from the discussion in section [ su(2)_2d ] . finally in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize what we have learned from these examples and discuss open questions .",
    "in one space and one time dimension there are two distinct spts protected by so(3 ) symmetry@xcite . a possible realization of these two phases is given by the two dimer states of a _ spin 1/2 _ nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic chain with alternating antiferromagnetic bond strength shown in panel ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "]    why do we regard the two phases in question as so(3 ) , not su(2 ) , spts ?",
    "first , we can define the spatial unit cell ( e.g. the boxes in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) so that the total spin in each cell is integral , hence carrying the faithful ( `` linear '' ) representation of so(3 ) .",
    "ultimately what determines whether a phase has stable gapless edge states is the following rule : what degrees of freedom and what kind of perturbations are we allowed to add locally , and hence to the edge . if we regard the `` on site '' ( or `` on cell '' ) symmetry group as so(3 ) , then only integral spins are allowed to be added to the edge . since the edges in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) have half integer spins , adding integer spins can not completely gap them out . on the other hand",
    "if we regard the on site symmetry group as su(2 ) , half integer spins can be added . in that case",
    "the edge spins in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) are not `` symmetry protected '' .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) defines a nontrivial spt phase only with @xmath0 symmetry and with each unit cell containing two spin 1/2 s . defining the unit cell also sets the rule for spatial truncation when a chain is cut open .",
    "_ a finite spin chain must include an integer number of unit cells .",
    "_ when we truncate a spin chain we are not allowed to cut through the unit cells .",
    "another question that requires immediate attention is the following . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] if we move all unit cells by one lattice spacing ( between two spin 1/2 s not two unit cells ) and complete the chain by adding the missing part of the unit cells at the two ends , then the role of panel ( a ) and ( c ) will be exchanged . hence there seems to be ambiguity in which phase should be called trivial / non - trivial .",
    "indeed , trivialness and non - trivialness only have relative meaning .",
    "the best way to tell whether two phases are in the same topological class or not is to make an interface between them and see whether there is gapless interface states ( see fig .  [ fig1](d ) ) .",
    "the non - trivial spt in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) can be adiabatically transformed to the haldane phase@xcite by turning on an intra unit cell ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "there is no phase transition as we turn up the ratio between the ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic interactions .      the critical point between the trivial and the non trivial spts in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the gapless heisenberg s=1/2 chain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "it s effective field theory is the level-1 su(2 ) ( su(2)@xmath6 ) wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) theory in 1 + 1 dimensions@xcite : & & s_critical = dxdt _ j = x , ttr(_j g^-1_j g)+s_wzw + & & s_wzw = dxdt_0 ^ 1dutr[(g^-1_u g)(g^-1_t g)(g^-1_x g)].[su(2)_1]in the above @xmath7su(2 ) . because the homotopy group from @xmath8 ( the space - time manifold ) to su(2 ) is trivial , we can always extend the image @xmath9 to @xmath10 so that the former ( @xmath9 ) is the boundary ( @xmath11 ) ) of the latter .",
    "for @xmath12 the @xmath13 configuration is taken to be a constant element of su(2 ) so that it has a trivial berry s phase .",

    "we have shown that the interface theory is the critical theory spatially confined between the trivial and non - trivial spts .",
    "this is the formal justification of the physical picture ( for boundary states ) discussed in the introduction .",
    "in this subsection we address the first question `` what differentiates the critical point of spts phase transition from symmetry breaking critical points ? '' to get some hints we first look at the results of exact diagonalization for a finite spin 1/2 heisenberg chain under open boundary condition .",

    "( [ vector ] ) and integrate @xmath30 over @xmath43 $ ] we obtain eq .",
    "( [ spin ] ) , namely the berry phase of a spin 1/2 .",
    "this is not surprising because eq .",
    "( [ open ] ) is the domain wall configuration extended to the entire system !",
    "this `` spinon '' excitation is delocalized throughout the bulk and it is consistent with the ground state of an odd - site chain being @xmath44 .",
    "of course when the chain consists of an even number of sites the appropriate field configuration is _",
    "even(x , t , u)=((t , u),),[open1]where @xmath45 is an integer . in this case",
    "the resulting berry phase we obtain is that for integer spins , which is consistent with the fact that the ground state and excited states of a even - site chain must have integral total spin .",
    "since the very notion of so(3 ) spt requires each unit cell of the system to have integral total spin , the following question immediately arises .",
    "can an odd - site heisenberg chain be realized in a system whose unit cell has integral spin ? while the critical state at phase transition between two spts necessarily has integral total spin , it is possible to have an odd - site heisenberg chain at an extended spatial domain wall between the spts , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the rectangular boxes enclose the unit cells and the red dots mark the odd - site heisenberg chain .",
    "of course what makes this possible is the fact that the bond assignment is that of an extended domain wall between the trivial and non - trivial spt .    ]    in the literature it is known that the su(2)@xmath6 wzw theory can be viewed as describing a _ non - interacting gas of spinons _ obeying `` semion exclusion principle''.@xcite for even - site chains , spinons must appear in pairs .",
    "however for odd - site chains there must be an odd number of spinons .",
    "the above discussion clearly suggests that under open boundary condition with suitable chain length , the critical points of spt phase transitions possess bulk excitations which are the delocalized version of edge excitations .",
    "we think this correspondence between the edge and the critical bulk excitations is a special property of the critical points of spt transitions .",
    "although we reach the above conclusion by considering a continuous symmetry group , we expect the following conclusions to apply more generally , in particular , for discrete symmetry groups as well : ( a ) under the `` domain wall boundary condition '' the critical point of spt phase transitions possess the delocalized version of the edge excitations ; ( 2 ) the edge theory is the critical theory confined spatially between two different spt phases .",
    "in 2 + 1 space - time dimensions the symmetry group su(2 ) allows for non - trivial spts .",
    "each of them corresponds to an element of @xmath46 ( @xmath47)@xcite . the edge states of these spts are governed by the su(2)@xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) wzw theory@xcite .",
    "let s start by constructing the @xmath50 spt , which corresponds to the generator of @xmath46 .      in complete analogy to the previous section",

    "the edge theory of a 2 + 1 d spt is always gapless and no fine tuning is required .",
