    "iii . the dirac monopoles ( or rather dyons , due to self - duality ) as the sources of the abelian field lines , extrapolated back to the cores .",
    "if well separated and localised , all these coincide  @xcite . here",
    "we study the case of two constituents coming close together for @xmath7 , with an example for @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath8 can be ordered by a constant gauge transformation @xmath9 & & -3 mm w_^w_== , + & & -3mm_1 ",
    "_n_n+11+_1 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the constituent monopoles have masses @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( using the classical scale invariance to put the extent of the euclidean time direction to one , @xmath13 ) . in the same way we can bring @xmath14 to this form by a _ local _ gauge function , @xmath15 .",
    "we note that @xmath16 ( unique up to a residual abelian gauge rotation ) and @xmath17 will be smooth , except where two ( or more ) eigenvalues coincide .",
    "the ordering shows there are @xmath4 different types of singularities ( called defects  @xcite ) , for each of the _ neighbouring _ eigenvalues to coincide .",
    "the first @xmath18 are associated with the basic monopoles ( as part of the inequivalent @xmath19 subgroups related to the generators of the cartan subgroup ) .",
    "the @xmath20 defect arises when the first and the last eigenvalue ( still neighbours on the circle ) coincide .",
    "its magnetic charge ensures charge neutrality of the caloron .",
    "the special status  @xcite of this defect also follows from the so - called taubes winding  @xcite , supporting the non - zero topological charge  @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) to the action density for the @xmath28 caloron , with @xmath33 constituents .",
    "the topological charge can be reduced to surface integrals near the singularities with the use of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "if one assumes _ all _ defects are pointlike , this can be used to show that for each of the @xmath4 types the ( net ) number of defects has to equal the topological charge , the type being selected by the branch of the logarithm ( associated with the @xmath4 elements in the center )  @xcite .",
    "one might expect the defects to merge when the constituent monopoles do .",
    "a triple degeneracy of eigenvalues for @xmath0 implies the polyakov loop takes a value in the center .",
    "yet this can be shown _ not _ to occur for the @xmath0 caloron with _ unequal _ masses .",
    "we therefore seem to have ( at least ) one more defect than the number of constituents , when @xmath36 .",
    "we will study in detail a generic example in @xmath0 , with @xmath37 .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the position associated with the @xmath22 constituent where two eigenvalues of the polyakov loop coincide . in the gauge where @xmath39 ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , we established numerically  @xcite that p_1=p(z_1)=(e^-i_3 , e^-i_3,e^2i_3 ) , + p_2=p(z_2)=(e^2i_1 , e^-i_1,e^-i_1 ) , + p_3=p(z_3)=(-e^-i_2 , e^2i_2,-e^-i_2).this is for _ any _ choice of holonomy and constituent locations ( with the proviso they are well separated , i.e. their cores do not overlap , in which case to a good approximation @xmath40 ) . here",
    "we take @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the limit of coinciding constituents is achieved by @xmath44 . with this geometry",
    "it is simplest to follow for changing @xmath45 the location where two eigenvalues coincide . in very good approximation ,",
    "as long as the first two constituents remain well separated from the third constituent ( carrying the taubes winding ) , @xmath46 will be constant in @xmath45 and the @xmath0 gauge field  @xcite of the first two constituents will be constant in time ( in the periodic gauge ) .",
    "thus @xmath47 for @xmath48 , greatly simplifying the calculations .",
    "when the cores of the two approaching constituents start to overlap , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are no longer diagonal ( but still block diagonal , mixing the lower @xmath51 components ) . at @xmath52 they are diagonal again , but @xmath50 will be no longer in the fundamental weyl chamber . a weyl reflection maps it back , while for @xmath53 a more general gauge rotation back to the cartan subgroup is required to do so , see fig .  1 .",
    "at @xmath52 , _ each _ @xmath54 ( and @xmath55 ) lies on the dashed line , which is a direct consequence of the reduction to an @xmath19 caloron .    to illustrate this more clearly , we give the expressions for @xmath54 ( which we believe to hold for any non - degenerate choice of the @xmath56 ) when @xmath57 : p_1=p(z_1)=(e^2i_2 , e^2i_2,e^-4i_2 ) , + p_2=p(z_2)=(e^-i_2 , e^2i_2,e^-i_2 ) , + p_3=p(z_3)=(-e^-i_2 , e^2i_2,-e^-i_2).these can be factorised as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 describes an overall @xmath60 factor . in terms of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "the @xmath19 embedding in @xmath0 becomes obvious .",
    "it leads for @xmath64 to the trivial and for @xmath65 to the non - trivial element of the center of @xmath19 ( appropriate for the latter , carrying the taubes winding ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 , which for the @xmath19 caloron is not related to coinciding eigenvalues . for @xmath44 , fig .",
    "2 shows that @xmath68 gets `` stuck '' at a _",
    "finite _ distance ( 0.131419 ) from @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath19 embedding determines the caloron solution for @xmath70 , with constituent locations @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and masses @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the best proof for the spurious nature of the defect is to calculate its location purely in terms of this @xmath19 caloron , by demanding the @xmath19 polyakov loop to equal @xmath75 . for this we can use the analytic expression  @xcite of the @xmath19 polyakov loop along the @xmath76-axis .",
    "the location of the spurious defect , @xmath77 , is found by solving @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "for our example , @xmath79 indeed verifies this equation .    with the @xmath19 embedded result at hand , we find that only for @xmath80 the defects merge to form a triple degeneracy .",
    "using @xmath81 , this is so for coinciding constituent monopoles of _ equal _ mass . for _ unequal _ masses",
    "the defect is always spurious , but it tends to stay within reach of the non - abelian core of the coinciding constituent monopoles , except when the mass difference approaches its extremal values @xmath82 , see fig .  2 ( bottom ) . at these extremal values",
    "one of the @xmath0 constituents becomes massless and _ delocalised _ , which we excluded for @xmath53 .",
    "however , the limit @xmath44 is singular due to the _ global _ decomposition into @xmath83 at @xmath52 .",
    "gauge rotations @xmath84 in the global @xmath19 subgroup do not affect @xmath59 , and therefore any @xmath85 gives rise to the _ same _ accidental degeneracy .",
    "in particular solving @xmath86 $ ] ( corresponding to the weyl reflection @xmath87 ) yields @xmath88 for @xmath89 ( isolated point in fig .  2 ( top ) ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath90 traces out a ( nearly spherical ) _ shell _ where two eigenvalues of @xmath91 coincide ( note that for @xmath80 this shell collapse to a single point , @xmath92 ) .",
    "a perturbation tends to remove this accidental degeneracy .",
    "abelian projected monopoles are not always what they seem to be , even though required by topology .",
    "_ topology _ can not be localised , no matter how tempting this may seem for smooth fields .",
