    "the tidal interaction between small satellites and the gas or particle disks in which they are embedded is a subject of wide study in the planetary community .",
    "these satellites are tidally coupled via disk tides , i.e. , satellites excite spiral density waves at the lindblad resonances in the disk ( goldreich & tremaine 1978 , 1980 ; artymowicz 1993 ) . as a result of these tidal interactions ,",
    "gaps can be opened up in the embedded disks as in the case of the shepherding moons of saturn s rings ( goldreich & tremaine 1978 ) or in type - ii migration ( ward 1997 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if a gap does not open up , satellite may migrate inward rapidly due to tidal torque imbalances , i.e. , type - i migration ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "the wide applicability of satellite - disk interactions in the planetary community raises an interesting question of whether the same physics may be applicable at larger scales , i.e. , galactic scales . in this paper",
    ", i will address this question by considering a very simple model , which illustrate the modification of the physics of satellite - disk interaction when applied on a galactic scale .",
    "most notably , the critical difference is that in addition to tidal torques , the satellite will experience dynamical friction .",
    "the inclusion of dynamical friction produces a non - trivial effect .",
    "namely , dynamical friction on the satellite provides a sink of angular momentum in the system . as a result ,",
    "the coupled satellite - disk system will continually lose angular momentum and sink toward the center .    to study this physics , i consider a very simple model . in my model ,",
    "a satellite starts out in a circular orbit at a large radius and sinks toward the central mass concentration because of dynamical friction on the background stars .",
    "along its infall , it encounters a coplanar gaseous disk or ring , which initially has a finite radial extent , @xmath2 .",
    "tides begin to couple the satellite with the disk . because the satellite - disk system continues to suffer an ongoing loss of angular momentum from dynamical friction",
    ", it will shrink in radius . as a result gas",
    "can be transported on the dynamical friction timescale to smaller radii .",
    "in addition , i find that this satellite - disk interaction also builds a substantial surface density enhancement at the disk edge",
    ". this may lead to enhanced star formation at the disk edge .",
    "this process which i call _ gas shepherding _ may be a generic feature of gaseous disks around galaxies , if a sufficiently massive and dense satellite is available .",
    "the physics of satellite - disk interactions in galaxies or gas shepherding is not just an interesting exercise in mathematical physics , but may be important in the fueling of active galaxies and central starbursts .",
    "first , the action of dynamical friction on the satellite - disk system will shrink radius of the disk , thereby transporting gas to smaller radii .",
    "this shepherding of gas will continue until the gas is forced into the center or the shepherding satellite is destroyed .",
    "i will discuss this scenario for nuclear fueling and how it compares to competing scenarios in this paper .",
    "i have structured this paper as follows . in  [ sec : basic picture ] , i discuss the basic picture of gas shepherding and give a few order of magnitude estimates .",
    "i estimate the timescale for gas shepherding and the expected surface density enhancement .",
    "i present the physics of gas shepherding and solve numerical models in  [ sec : shepherding ] .",
    "i also present an approximate analytic solution to this problem .",
    "i then discuss the application of gas shepherding to the feeding of active galactic nuclei and central starbursts in  [ sec : applications ] .",
    "finally i present my conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the basic picture of gas shepherding is illustrated by figure [ fig : cartoon1 ] . a gas disk with a radius of @xmath3 and surface density of @xmath4 orbits about a spherical mass distribution with enclosed mass of stars or dark matter of @xmath5 . due to dynamical friction on the stellar background ,",
    "an external satellite with mass @xmath6 slowly spirals in on a circular orbit with a radius of @xmath7 in the same orbital plane of the gas disk .",
    "the radial velocity at which the satellite initially spirals into the gas disk due to dynamical friction is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the orbital velocity of the satellite .",
    "as the satellite approaches the disk edge , i.e. , @xmath7 approaches @xmath3 , the satellite excites spiral density waves at the lindblad resonances ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) , which transfers angular momentum from the disk to the satellite .",
    "this angular momentum is in turn transferred to the background stars or dark matter via dynamical friction on the satellite .",
    "since angular momentum of the satellite - disk system is continually bled , the radius of the satellite - disk system will shrink at the shepherding velocity , @xmath10 .",
    "i first give some simple order of magnitude estimates of this process .",
    "the dynamical friction timescale for a satellite is ( chandrasekhar 1943 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dynamical time , @xmath13 is the orbital frequency of the satellite , and @xmath14 is newton s constant .",
    "the torque due to dynamical friction on the satellite , @xmath15 , is @xmath16 the torque due to the excitation of spiral density waves in a disk is ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1986 ; ward & hourigan 1989 ; artymowicz 1993 ; ward 1997 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the disk , i have presumed that radial separation between satellite and disk is small compared to the radius , i.e. , @xmath19 .    for",
    "now , i assume that there is no internal rearrangement of angular momentum in the disk , i.e. , an inviscid disk .",
    "dynamical friction torques down the satellite ( @xmath15 ) , while the disk , whose edge sits at @xmath20 , torques up the satellite ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "when @xmath22 , the satellite and the disk are well coupled for @xmath23 , i.e. , the mass of the satellite is smaller or comparable to the mass of the disk .",
    "setting @xmath24 gives @xmath25 which i define as the `` hill '' radius of the disk , @xmath26 .",
    "this gives the natural scale for the radial separation between disk and satellite , i.e. , @xmath27 .    for spiral density waves that damp locally , the radial extent of the disk over which the satellite exerts torques is also @xmath28 .",
    "assuming no viscous spreading , the disk surface density will be enhanced at the disk edge due to the piling up of material from the initial radius of @xmath2 to the current radius of @xmath3 .",
    "this enhancement due to a satellite that sinks a distance @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath4 is the surface density and @xmath31 is the initial surface density . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the enhancement is a factor of a few to ten .",
    "to study this problem in greater detail , i begin by writing the equations for a viscous disk that is evolving under the influence of an external torque .",
    "the equation of continuity is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath35 is the radial component of the velocity ( frank , king , amd raine 2002 ) .",
    "the angular momentum equation is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the orbital frequency , @xmath38 is the mass enclosed inside @xmath34 , and @xmath39 is the viscous torque , @xmath40 is the viscosity ( frank , king , amd raine 2002 ) . using equation ( [ eq : angular momentum ] ) ,",
    "i find is a function only of the coordinate , @xmath34 , assuming that the mass enclosed , i.e. , @xmath41 is not an explicit function of time .",

    "the satellite begins to fall inward via dynamical friction .",
    "as the satellite approaches the disk , the disk exerts a torque on the satellite , which slows its infall . at the same time , the surface density of the disk increases at the disk edge .",
    "i show this evolution for @xmath103 , @xmath95 , and @xmath104 in figure [ fig : md0.1 ] .",
    "i start the evolution of the satellite at @xmath105 .",
    "when the satellite sinks to @xmath106 , i set @xmath107 and plot the evolution of the satellite - disk system in intervals of @xmath108 for a total of @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the dynamical friction timescale at @xmath2 . at @xmath107 the disk is undisturbed except for a small amount of spreading due to viscosity at the disk edge .",
    "the satellite position is at @xmath111 as noted by the black dot labeled a. i evolve in intervals of @xmath112 and note that the disk satellite system has begun to respond ( point labeled b ) .",
    "the disk begins to develop a surface density enhancement and the satellite slows down a bit . evolving for another @xmath113 , i.e. , the point labeled c , shows a substantial change .",
    "the surface density increases near the disk edge by a maximum factor of @xmath114 . note that the distance between point b and c is substantially smaller than the distance between a and b , which results from the backreaction of the disk tides . by point d",
    ", the density enhancement is @xmath115 .",
    "note also that the distance between point d and its neighbor is somewhat larger than the other separations .",
    "this is due to the decrease in the dynamical friction timescale compared to the dynamical timescale when the mass enclosed decreases relative to the satellite mass .    in figure",
    "[ fig : md0.01 ] and [ fig : md1 ] , i show the case for @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively . for @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : md0.01 ] ) , the initial infall of the satellite is stopped by the disk because of the large mass ratio between the satellite and the disk .",
    "in addition , there is no surface density enhancement at the disk edge . for @xmath118 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : md1 ] ) , on the other hand , the initial infall of the satellite is only slightly slowed because the mass of the disk and satellite are the same . in this case , a huge surface density enhancement is produced .",
    "one remarkable aspect of figures [ fig : md0.1 ] and [ fig : md1 ] is that they appear to approach quasi - steady state solutions .",
    "this is especially clear in figure [ fig : md0.1 ] .",
    "motivated by the appearance of these quasi - steady state solutions , i find an approximate kinematic wave solution in  [ sec : approx ] , which agrees well with these numerical results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vp ] , i plot the normalized shepherding velocity of the satellite disk system , i.e. , normalized to the initial infall velocity , @xmath119 ( lower plot ) and the local infall velocity , @xmath120 ( upper plot ) , as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath116 , 0.1 , and 1 .",

    "i plot the local dynamical friction infall velocity , @xmath122 . for @xmath123 , @xmath124 because tidal coupling between the disk and satellite has not yet been achieved .",
    "once the coupling has been achieved , i.e. @xmath125 , the shepherding velocity depends mainly on the mass ratio between the satellite and disk , @xmath92 , and is independent of the viscosity , @xmath93 .",
    "this highlights the fact that dynamical friction dominates the dynamics .",
    "i also plot an estimate for migration velocity ( eq.[[eq : vp estimate ] ] ) for @xmath126 , i.e. , i allow the shepherding satellite to fall inside of one hill radius of the disk to allow a kinematic wave solution to be set up ( see  [ sec : approx ] ) .",
    "this estimate ( eq.[[eq : vp estimate ] ] ) gives remarkably good results , i.e. , @xmath127 for the fidicial cases of @xmath128 and @xmath117 .",
    "the most remarkable aspect of figure [ fig : vp ] is that while the infall velocity falls substantially , a sizeable fraction of the initial infall velocity remains .",
    "for instance , the infall velocity does not fall below 20% of the initial infall velocity for the @xmath128 case .",
    "the shepherding satellite transports gas from large radii to smaller radii by dumping the angular momentum of the gas into the background stars or dark matter .",
    "moreover , this transport is achieved on a dynamical friction timescale , which can be fast for sufficiently massive satellites .",
    "this transport will continue unless the gas is consumed via star formation or the satellite is tidally disrupted by the increasing density of the background ( see  [ sec : shepherd destruction ] ) .",
    "motivated by the numerical results of  [ sec : numerical ] i now solve equations ( [ eq : master1 ] ) and ( [ eq : master2 ] ) using a kinematic wave approach inspired by the planetary literature ( hourigan & ward 1984 ; ward & hourigan 1989 ; ward 1997 ; rafikov 2002 ) .",

    "for instance , the term @xmath138 changes rapidly with small @xmath130 , whereas @xmath139 changes very slowly .",

    "the two terms in the parenthesis are both negative because @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( inward migration ) .",
    "the first term in the parenthesis cuts off the surface density as @xmath130 becomes more negative , i.e. , away from the disk edge , while the second term cuts off the surface density as it approaches the disk edge due to tidal interactions .",

    "@xmath154 hence , @xmath155 , so given an estimate for @xmath156 , i can determine the constant of integration , @xmath148 , via @xmath157    in the appendix , i calculate @xmath156 by balancing the torque from the satelite - disk interaction with the torque from dynamical friction .",
    "i find the following cubic equation ( eq.[[eq : sigma max cubic app ] ] ) : @xmath158 which i solve numerically .",
    "this gives an estimate for @xmath159 and hence , @xmath148 , given @xmath160 .",

    "i estimate the torque using equation ( [ eq : torque estimate df ] ) .",
    "the satellite raises tides on the disk , which do not operate over the entire disk , i.e. the tides are most acute at the edge of the disk due to the @xmath162 scaling of the torque density .",

    "as the satellite - disk system should continually shrink due to dynamical friction , it raises the interesting question of whether or not such a mechanism may be deliver gas into the nuclear regions of galaxies .",
    "the fueling of central starbursts and active galactic nuclei remains an open question .",
    "it is generally believed that the fueling of central starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) requires the delivery of gas from large radii to small radii ( for a review see shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ; hereafter sbf90 ) .",
    "gas transport is mediated at small radii ( @xmath189 pc ) by a thin accretion disk . at much larger radii ( @xmath190 kpc )",
    ", galactic bars can efficiently transport gas .",
    "how is gas transported in the gap between @xmath191 kpc to @xmath189 pc ? galactic bars , while efficient at large scales , stop at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , which is at @xmath192 kpc .",
    "thin accretion disks , which are sufficient at small scales , would become gravitationally unstable and would fragment to form stars outside of @xmath189 pc ( paczynski 1978 ; kolykhalov & sunyaev 1980 ; shlosman & begelman 1987 ; goodman 2003 ; thompson , quataert & murray 2005 ) .",
    "there are several possible modes by which this transport may be accomplished .",
    "first the gas is transported by large - scale _ gaseous _ gravitational instabilities , i.e. , the `` bars within bars '' model ( shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ) .",
    "secondly , the gas may form a thick turbulent marginally stable accretion disk powered by star formation ( paczynski 1978 ; kolykhalov & sunyaev 1980 ; shlosman & begelman 1987 ; goodman 2003 ) via radiation pressure ( goodman & tan 2004 ; thompson et al .",
    "2005 ) or supernova ( wada & norman 2002 ) .",
    "third , if the gas exist in the form of molecular clouds , collisions between them may lead to episodic feeding of the nuclear regions , i.e. , the chaotic accretion scenario ( krolik & begelman 1988 ; sbf90 ; hopkins & hernquist 2006 ; king & pringle 2007 ; nayakshin and king 2007 ) .",
    "finally , the fueling of these central regions by be one of brute force , where major or minor mergers drive gas from the disk of the galaxy to the nuclear region ( hernquist 1989 ; bekki & noguchi 1994 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 )    in the `` bars within bars '' scenario , shlosman , frank , & begelman ( 1989 ) argued that if a gravitationally unstable gas disk is sufficiently massive such that it fulfills the ostriker - peebles criterion ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ) , it forms a secondary gaseous bar which funnels gas inward on a dynamical time .",
    "numerical simulations confirmed the viability of `` bars within bars '' ( see for instance friedli & martinet 1993 ; levine et al 2007 ) .",
    "it demands a substantial mass in gas , @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the enclosed mass .",
    "while such large gas concentrations are observed ( see for instance jogee et al .",
    "2005 ) , delivered into the nuclear region by large scale bars , it is unclear if this mechanism drives the bulk of agn fueling and quasar activity .",
    "namely , the observed correlation between large - scale bars , which transports gas into the central region of galaxies , and seyfert activity is statistically marginal ( see the review by ho 2008 and references therein ; see the review by combes 2003 and references therein ; but also see laine et al 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , there is no evidence that seyferts have a higher fraction of nuclear bars ( see knapen 2004 and references therein ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the disk is gravitationally unstable but lacks sufficient mass to fulfill the demands of `` bars within bars '' , the gas will fragment and form stars .",
    "the process of star formation may feed back on the disk to provide vertical support , maintaining marginal stability , i.e. , @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the toomre q ( see for instance shlosman & begelman 1989 ; goodman 2003 ; goodman & tan 2004 ; thompson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these thick marginally stable disks may have a sufficiently large scaleheight such that accretion via viscous processes is possible before all the gas is consumed .",
    "third , perhaps the gas exist primary in the form of molecular clouds",
    ". collisions between these molecular clouds provides something akin to a viscosity ( krolik & begelman 1988 ; sbf90 ) .",
    "these clouds would then feed the nuclear region in a chaotic fashion ( hopkins & hernquist 2006 ; king & pringle 2007 ; nayakshin and king 2007 ) .",
    "typically , the viscosity due to cloud - cloud collision appears to be insufficient for fueling the central regions from hundreds of parsecs .",
    "however , it may be necessary around the sphere of influence of the central black hole where large scale instabilities may not operate ( sbf90 ; see  [ sec : final 10 pc ] )    fourth , the fueling of central nuclear activity need not be due to gas in the ism , but gas liberated from disrupted stars .",
    "hills ( 1975 ) proposed that the tidal disruption of stars ( rees 1988 ) may be a means by which active galaxies may be fueled .",
    "these rates of tidal disruption are enhanced in mergers of galaxies ( roos 1981 ) , which links the three phenomenon of merging galaxies , active galactic nuclei , and tidal disruption of stars .",
    "alternatively , a pre - existing gas disk may capture stars plunging through it , subsequently disrupting these stars , which replenishes the disk .",
    "this gas may then viscously accrete , fueling the central engine ( miralda - escud & kollmeier 2005 ) .",
    "finally , mergers between galaxies may drive gas toward the nuclear regions of galaxies where they fuel nuclear activity ( hernquist 1989 ; bekki & noguchi 1994 ; bekki 1995 ) .",
    "this possibility may fuel ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasar activity as modeled , for instance , by springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and has significant observational support ( see for instance sanders et al 1988 ) .",
    "however , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity appears to be due to more quiescent phenomenon ( li et al 2006 ; hopkins & hernquist 2006 ) .",
    "for instance , li et al .",
    "( 2006 ) explored the clustering properties of agn in data release 4 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and concluded that interactions are unlikely to be the main culprit in the fueling of agns .",
    "minor mergers are another possibility ( see for instance mihos & hernquist 1994 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ; tanguchi & wada 1996 ; taniguchi 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "gas shepherding is another scenario by which gas is tranported from hundreds of parsecs .",
    "the gas shepherding scenario , which i present is as follows : large scale bars drive gas toward the central regions of a galaxy where they collect in a nuclear ring , i.e. the gas transitions from @xmath197 to roughly circular @xmath198 orbits ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) at a radii of a few hundred parsecs to 1 - 2 kiloparsecs ( buta & combes 1996 ; knapen 2004 ) .",
    "this gaseous ring becomes gravitationally unstable and forms giant molecular clouds which in turn collapse to form star clusters in coplanar orbits ( see for instance , maoz et al .",
    "2001 ; jogee et al .",
    "if the star cluster formed is sufficiently massive , it may shepherd in the remnant gas in the gaseous ring from a few hundred parsecs into the center .",
    "i first compare the timescale of shepherding and viscous processes . for an @xmath80 viscosity ,",
    "the viscous timescale is @xmath199 ( frank , king , & raine 2002 ) . for a marginally stable disk ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath195 , @xmath200 . therefore the ratio between the shepherding timescale , @xmath201 , and the viscous timescale , @xmath202 , is @xmath203 these timescales become comparable to each other for thicker disks ,",
    "i.e. @xmath204 , or lower mass satellites , i.e. , @xmath205 or a combination of the two . thus when shepherding operates , it dominates over viscous processes for low mass disk and large satellites .",
    "therefore , for this scenario to work , the star cluster that is formed must be sufficiently massive compared to the mass of the gas disk .",
    "i would expect it to be at least 10% or greater in order for shepherding to be efficient based on equation ( [ eq : visc_vs_shep ] ) and on my calculations in  [ sec : shepherding ] .",
    "if gas shepherding operates , what ultimately happends to this shepherded gas ?",
    "first , if this gas is in a marginally stable disk , it may fragment into stars at the disk edge ( see for instance thompson et al .",
    "2005 ; levin 2007 ; chang et al .",
    "2007 ; nayakshin , cuadra , & springel 2007 ; van der ven & chang in preparation ) .",
    "secondly , this gas may be shepherded into a radius where the shepherding satellite is tidally disrupted .",
    "i now discuss these two possibilities below .",
    "marginally stable disks with sufficiently rapid cooling ( @xmath206 ) will tend to fragment ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "in the galactic context this fragmentation will lead to star formation , which may feed back on the disk , maintaining marginal stability .",
    "this feedback may be due to momentum driving ( murray , quataert , & thompson 2005 ; thompson et al . 2005 ) , cosmic ray feedback ( socrates , davis , & ramirez - ruiz 2008 ) , or supernovae driven turbulence ( wada & norman 2002 ) .",
    "a surface density enhancement of a few to ten would enhance local star formation .",
    "i take the standard kennicutt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) for the star formation rate to be @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the star formation rate per unit area , @xmath4 is the gas surface density , @xmath209 is the empirically determined efficiency .",
    "equation ( [ eq : starformationrate ] ) suggests that the star formation rate would also be enhanced by the same factor as that of the surface density .",
    "equation ( [ eq : starformationrate ] ) implies that the timescale for the gas to fragment into stars is @xmath210 the ratio between the timescale for shepherding and the timescale for the gas to fragment into stars is @xmath211 thus , sufficiently large satellites can shepherd a considerable fraction of the gas into the central regions before the gas completely fragments into stars . for typical numbers ( @xmath212 ) , this implies a satellite mass @xmath213 .    for less massive satellites , the disk would completely fragment into stars .",
    "thus , the evolution would likely be different . as the satellite continues to fall inward",
    ", it captures these newly - formed stars into mean - motion and secular resonances , which increases the star s eccentricity and inclination .",
    "indeed , yu , lu , & lin ( 2007 ) have suggested that this exact process may be responsible for the distribution of the young stars in the galactic center ( gc ) . in this case , an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) or dark cluster falls into a disk of stars in the same orbital plane .",
    "the stellar disk is heated up as the stars are captured into the previously - mentioned resonance .",
    "some of these stars are forced to migrate with the infalling imbh , while others are forced into close encounters .",
    "some of these stars that are subjected to these close encounters may be ejected out of the gc at large velocities , producing hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) or hypervelocity binaries ( hvbs ) ( lu , yu , & lin 2007 ) . hence stars , whose semi - major axis is larger than the current radius of the infalling imbh would be excited into a torus - like structure , while stars interior to the radius of the infalling imbh would remain in a cold disk .",
    "such a dynamical distribution may result from the effects of shepherding , but at much larger scales , i.e. , @xmath0 pc rather than @xmath214 pc as in the case in the gc .",
    "if this gas does not fragment into stars ( which is the case for sufficiently massive satellites ) , gas shepherding may transport a substantial amount of gas from @xmath215 kpc to smaller radii .",
    "as long as the satellite remains coherent , there is no limit to how far gas may be shepherded .",
    "this requirement that the satellite be sufficiently massive ( @xmath216 ) limits the number of possible systems that can serve as a shepherd .",
    "a super star cluster ( ssc ) is one such candidate .",
    "sscs range up to mass of @xmath217 with a radius of parsecs ( see for instance mccrady & graham 2007 ; hagele et al .",
    "2007 ) so they are sufficiently massive to transport gas before it completely fragments into stars .",
    "however , as they sink deeper into the bulge , tidal forces may disrupt them , stopping the shepherding process .",
    "the ssc is tidally disrupted when the enclosed background density @xmath218 is equal to their mean stellar density , @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the radial size of the ssc . plugging in a few example numbers ,",
    "i find that @xmath221 . for typical numbers , i.e. , @xmath212 at @xmath222 pc , @xmath223 so the radius where the satellite is disrupted is @xmath224 which would also be where the gas disk is shepherded down to .",
    "note that i have ignored the effect of the smbh , which begins to become important at such radii .",
    "the densities and density structures of these sscs are not very well constrained .",
    "mccrady and graham ( 2007 ) presents a very detailed study of the size and mass distrubution of super star clusters in the nearby starbursting galaxy m82 .",
    "the mean half power radius of these sscs is 1.8 pc ( mccrady and graham 2007 , their figure 7 ) , and there are quite a few clusters around @xmath225 . by equation ( [ eq : tidal disruption ] ) ,",
    "this gives a tidal disruption radius of about 10 pc .",
    "lets consider two examples in more detail .",
    "one example is ssc l in m82 which has a virial mass of @xmath226 , a projected half - light radius of @xmath227 , and a tidal disruption radius of @xmath228 .",
    "another example is ssc 11 , which has a virial mass of @xmath229 , a projected half light radius of @xmath230 pc , and a tidal disruption radius of @xmath231 pc . in another study ,",
    "hagele et al ( 2007 ) observed five star forming regions of the circumnuclear ring of ngc 3351 and found star cluster masses between @xmath232 and radii of @xmath233 pc .",
    "this would bracket tidal disruption radii between a few parsecs to 25 parsecs .",
    "hubble space telescope studies by maoz et al ( 1996 ) suggest that the star clusters formed in circumnuclear rings have sizes @xmath234 pc .",
    "hence , sscs appears have sufficient mass and density to shepherd gas into ten to tens of parsecs",
    ".    the destruction of a ssc may not be the result of tidal processes , but instead to internal processes , i.e. , stellar mass loss .",
    "thus , sscs may have a short lifetime in analogy with stellar clusters in our galaxy , i.e. , open clusters and ob associations .",
    "for typical galactic clusters , they are disrupted because gas ejection from the formation of hii regions and supernova ( lada and lada 2003 ) .",
    "however , sscs are thought to be the progenitors of globular clusters , whose lifetime is @xmath235 years , and thus their lifetime may be substantially longer .",
    "the vulnerability of sscs to these internal processes strongly depend on their stellar initial mass functions , i.e. , they must have a sufficient number of low mass stars ( meurer et al 1995 ) .",
    "top - heavy imfs are vulnerable to the disruptive processes of stellar mass loss and other processes ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "young , dense stellar clusters , the closest local analogues to sscs , show a significant population of low mass stars .",
    "for instance , the @xmath236 ( walborn et al 2002 ) stellar cluster , r136 in the large magellanic cloud has a large population of low mass stars down to @xmath237 ( brandl et al 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , mccrady et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found ssc 9 was consistent with a normal imf , though ssc 11 appeared to have a top heavy imf .    aside from sscs , the nucleated remains of an accreted satellite galaxy may also be the shepherds that herds that gas into the central regions of the galaxy for sufficiently small mass ratios . for mass",
    "ratio between the mass of the satellite galaxy s remnant and the _ dynamical mass _ is of order 10% or greater , long range tidal interactions may disrupt a central disk before the shepherding scenario outlined aboved can be set up and would be akin to the minor merger scenario studied previously ( hernquist 1989 ; bekki & noguchi 1994 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ; tanguchi & wada 1996 ; taniguchi 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "using the nucleated remains of satellite galaxies as shepherds is interesting , but a detailed study of this scenario is left to future work .      as i argue in  [ sec : shepherd destruction ] , sscs can shepherd gas to within 10 to 10s of parsecs of the center .",
    "however , due to tidal disruption of the shepherds , gas shepherding is less effective at these small radii as a mechanism to drive gas further inward . a similar problem exists for the `` bars within bars '' scenario .",
    "once gaseous bars funnel the gas within the gravitational sphere of influence of a black hole , it becomes increasingly difficult to have a sufficient amount of mass to form nested bars ( sbf90 their figure 2 ) . as a result ,",
    "another means of gas transport between ten to tens of parsecs must operate for the gas shepherding and `` bars within bars '' scenarios , i.e. , the `` 10 parsec '' problem .",
    "one possibility , outlined by sbf90 , are cloud - cloud collisions . at the deposition radius ,",
    "the gas becomes marginally self - gravitating and fragments into molecular clouds whose collisions with one another serves as a source of viscosity which drives material into the central regions .",
    "typically , the viscosity scales like : @xmath238 where @xmath148 is the filling fraction of the clouds ( see sbf90 ) .",
    "it is unclear if this is more effective than magnetic ( see the review by balbus 2003 ) or gravitationally driven viscosities ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "the effects of cloud - cloud collisions on the velocity dispersion of the clouds is not known .",
    "the internal structure , i.e. , magnetic fields , will play a huge role in determining the efficiency of cloud - cloud collisional driven viscosity ( see for instance krolik & begelman 1988 ) .",
    "another way by which this final `` 10 pc problem '' can be solved is via a disk which is supported either by radiation pressure ( thompson et al . 2005 ) , supernova driven turbulence ( wada & norman 2002 ; kawakatu & wada 2008 ) , or cosmic ray pressure ( socrates , davis , & ramirez - ruiz 2008 ) .",
    "the gas disk or ring which results from the deposition of gas at ten to tens of parsecs may form a marginally stable disk which is supported by star formation / supernova which can then viscously accrete .",
    "one - zone calculations by thompson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that a star formation rate of @xmath239 is sufficient to support a marginally stable disk at ten to tens of parsecs ( see thompson et al .",
    "2005 , their figure 5 ) , while also allows for a nontrivial accretion rate onto the central black hole .",
    "i note that the strengths of the `` bars within bars '' or gas shepherding scenarios and that of the starburst supported disk scenario are complementary to one another . inside of tens of parsecs , modest star formation rates can support a radiation pressure supported disk rather than requiring @xmath240 star formation rates from 200 pcs inward ( again see thompson et al .",
    "2005 , their figure 5 ) .",
    "recent observation of ngc 3227 by davies et al .",
    "( 2006 ) support this notion of star formation in a gas disk at small radii .",
    "however , the current star formation rate of @xmath241 appears to be insufficient to support the vertical scale of the disk .",
    "other forms of pressure support , i.e. , cosmic ray pressure ( see socrates , davis , & ramirez - ruiz 2007 their appendix e ) , may be important in this context .",
    "i have calculated the action of an infalling satellite on a coplanar gaseous disk .",
    "the satellite falls inward because of dynamical friction and couples to the gaseous disk via disk tides . due to the unrelenting loss of angular momentum , the satellite - disk system shrinks in radius .",
    "thus , gas is transported from larger radii to smaller radii .",
    "i calculate the structure of the evolving disk as a function of radius , both numerically and analytically and show a significant density enhancement at the disk edge .",
    "this density enhancement is due to the transport of gas initially at larger radii to a ring that is @xmath129 thick radially .",
    "the fate of this shepherded gas is not known .",
    "i presented two possible outcomes : 1 .",
    "the gas will fragment and form stars or 2 .",
    "the gas is shepherded into the nuclear region . in the latter case",
    ", i suggest that the gas shepherding scenario , which i have presented may be one means by which the `` 100 parsec '' problem may be resolved . for this to occur",
    ", gas must be shepherded sufficiently rapidly such that the gas is not completely consumed in star formation , which requires a sufficiently massive satellite ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "i argue that such massive satellites exist on the form of sscs .",
    "in the model presented , the physics of star formation is a disk environment has not been fully addressed .",
    "observationally , galactic star - forming disks appear to be marginally unstable to fragmentation , i.e. , @xmath242 ( thompson et al 2005 ) and their star formation rate follows the kennicutt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "these two points suggests that some sort of feedback is responsible for maintaining this careful balance between fragmentation and heating .",
    "how this feedback operates is not well understood .",
    "as discussed previously , various models have invoked radiation pressure ( thompson et al .",
    "2005 ) , supernova feedback ( wada & norman 2002 ) , and cosmic ray pressure ( socrates et al . 2008 ) from star formation .",
    "alternatively , the turbulent pressure support may result from gravitational instability , i.e. , gravitoturbulence ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "it is unclear that in the presence of gas shepherding if this equilibrium can be maintained at the edge of the disk where the surface density is enhanced .",
    "if it does not , this edge is likely to fragment completely into stars on a few dynamical times .",
    "it is also unclear if the kennicutt law would continue to hold at the disk edge .",
    "additional insights from future research on self - gravitating star - forming galactic disks will be needed to help formulate a more self - consistent calculation of the gas shepherding scenario , which will be needed to fully address the fate of the shepherded gas .",
    "assuming that the gas is not fully consumed in star formation , it would be shepherd down to 10 to 10s of parsecs ( see  [ sec : final 10 pc ] ) . at that radii cloud - cloud collisions ( krolik & begelman 1988 ; sbf90 ) or a starburst supported disk ( thompson et al . 2005 ) would allow the material to be viscously accreted .",
    "the initial satellite inclination and/or eccentricity is likely to significantly affect gas shepherding . in this paper",
    ", i have studied a special case where the orbit of the satellite is in the plane of the disk and approximately circular for simplicity .",
    "an eccentric satellite would have its eccentricity damped via the excitation of spiral density waves .",
    "if the eccentricity is below @xmath243 , i.e. , the satellite stays within one `` hill radius '' of the disk of its outer edge , then the shepherding calculation presented should be a reasonable estimate of the shepherding timescales and velocities .",
    "compared to a coplanar satellite , an inclined satellite would couple less well to the gaseous disk . for a sufficiently large inclination ,",
    "the gas disk and satellite would be effectively decoupled . however , its inclination could be sufficiently rapidly damped via induced bending waves in the gas disk in addition to spiral density waves ( see for instance ostriker 1994 ; terquem 1998 ) .",
    "once its inclination is damped below the critical value , where the disk and satellite become well coupled , the shepherding scenario presented in this paper would likely follow .",
    "i would expect this critical inclination to be of order @xmath244 , i.e. , the satellite stays within of order a `` hill radius '' of the disk above and below it .",
    "extending the present calculation to satellites of modest inclination would be fruitful and would allow a study of using the nucleated cores from minor mergers as shepherding satellites ( see  [ sec : shepherd destruction ] ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : applications ] , minor mergers may drive nuclear activity .",
    "the initial inclination of minor mergers is arbitary , but their inclination is damped as they interact with the _ large scale _ stellar and gaseous disk . as a result , they may approach the shepherding scenario presented in this paper .",
    "such a study is a subject for future work .",
    "in addition , dynamical friction would also act on the satellite - induced spiral density waves .",
    "dynamical friction of the extended mass perturbation , i.e. , the satellite - induced spiral density waves , may enhance the transfer of angular momentum between the gas disk and background stars ( tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) .",
    "a study of these effects , while fruitful , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the physics of gas shepherding is also important in other areas as well .",
    "for instance , it may shape radial distribution of star clusters in nuclear gas rings . in some of these nuclear ring systems ,",
    "the location of the star clusters is exterior to the gas ring from which they are presumably formed .",
    "for instance , ngc 4314 clearly show the star clusters exterior to the gas ( benedict et al .",
    "martini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the eight galaxies with strong bars all have star formation exterior to the dust ring in their sample of 123 galaxies .",
