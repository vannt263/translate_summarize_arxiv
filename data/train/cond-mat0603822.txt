    "confinement of water in nanopores affects many properties of water , such as freezing temperature , crystal structure  @xcite , the glass transition temperature , and the position of the hypothesized liquid - liquid ( ll ) critical point  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "water confined in nanoscale geometries has received much recent attention , in part because of its importance in biology , engineering , geophysics and atmospheric sciences .",
    "the effects of different kinds of confinement have been studied , both using experiments and simulations  @xcite .    bulk supercooled water ",
    "water cooled below the equilibrium freezing temperature  shows many anomalous properties  @xcite .",
    "experiments find that at low temperatures , various response functions , such as isothermal compressibility and specific heat , increase sharply .",
    "there has been comparatively less research on confined water .",
    "using the st2 potential to model water confined between smooth plates @xcite , a ll phase transition has been proposed .",
    "a liquid - to - amorphous transition is seen in simulations of water using the tip4p potential @xcite confined in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite suggests that hydrophobic lennard - jones ( lj ) confinement shifts the ll transition to lower temperature and lower pressure compared to bulk water , a feature also found in simulations of water confined between hydrophobic plates  @xcite .    confinement is known to enhance solidification of molecules that are more or less spherical  @xcite .",
    "however , careful experiments on thin films of water show that water performs extremely well as a lubricant , suggesting that confined water may be more fluid than bulk water  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show that water in hydrophilic confinement , when cooled to very low @xmath1 , does not freeze  @xcite  a phenomenon also supported by simulation studies  @xcite . in contrast , simulations  @xcite show that hydrophobically confined water does freeze into different crystalline structures , which do not have counterparts in bulk water .",
    "indeed monolayer , bilayer and trilayer ice have all been found in simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus hydrophobic confinement seems to facilitate the freezing of water .",
    "however the reason for this facilitation is not yet fully understood .",
    "the hydrogen - bond interaction between water molecules is an order of magnitude stronger than van der waals attraction with the hydrophobic walls .",
    "thus one may hypothesize that freezing in hydrophobic confinement depends critically on the separation between confining walls that may distort or facilitate a particular crystalline structure , rather than on the weak details of the water - wall interaction potential . to test this hypothesis",
    "we perform molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of water in two different forms of repusive confinement .",
    "specifically , we study :    * the @xmath0 repulsive part of the lj potential studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . * the same potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite but truncated and shifted such that there is no attractive part in the potential , analogous to the weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) potential  @xcite .",
    "this potential allows us to examine the role , if any , the attractive part of the water - wall lj potential plays in determining the thermodynamics and structure of confined water .",
    "we compare the case when the water - wall interactions are purely repulsive ( `` repulsive confinement '' ) with the studied case of pure lj confinement  @xcite .",
    "we also compare the freezing in repulsive confinements with the freezing found when the water - wall interactions are represented by an lj interaction ( `` lj hydrophobic confinement '' )  @xcite .",

    "we perform md simulations of a system composed of water - like molecules confined between two smooth walls .",
    "the molecules interact via the tip5p pair potential @xcite which , like the st2  @xcite potential , treats each water molecule as a tetrahedral , rigid , and non - polarizable unit consisting of five point sites  @xcite .",
    "the tip5p potential predicts many of the anomalies of bulk water @xcite .",
    "for example , tip5p reproduces the density anomaly at @xmath2  k and @xmath3  atm and its structural properties compare well with experiments @xcite .",
    "tip5p is known to crystallize at high pressures  @xcite within accessible computer simulation time scales , and shows a `` nose - shaped '' curve of temperature versus crystallization time  @xcite , a feature found in experimental data on water solutions @xcite .    in our simulations ,",

    "we control the temperature using the berendsen thermostat with a time constant of @xmath54 ps @xcite and use a simulation time step of @xmath55  fs , just as in the bulk system @xcite .",
    "water - water interactions are truncated at a distance  @xmath56  nm as discussed in ref .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of water is the existence of a temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) . relative to bulk water  lj confinement shifts the locus of the tmd to lower @xmath1 by @xmath57  k  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the sharpness of the density maximum is markedly decreased in comparison to the bulk .",
    "[ fig : pxy - comp ] shows isochores of @xmath58 for lj confinement , @xmath0 repulsive confinement and wca confinement , for similar densities .",
    "a tmd in this plot is coincident with the minimum in the isochore . for @xmath0 repulsive confinement",
    ", the minimum is very weak , but the location of the flatness in the isochore is near to that of the system with lj confinement .",
    "this result suggests the the @xmath0 repulsive confinement further suppresses the structural ordering of the molecules that is known to be responsible to the presence of a density maximum .",
    "the tmd for the case of wca confinement again appears at the same @xmath1 as the @xmath0 repulsive confinement and lj confinement cases but the isochore in the tmd region is flatter than for case the of lj confinement confinemen .",

    "we further notice that the value of the lateral pressure @xmath59  in the case of the lj confinement approaches the value of @xmath59 in case of wca confinement at high temperatures .",
    "this behavior of @xmath59 for lj confinement should be expected since at very high temperatures the molecules will not feel the potential minimum of the water - wall interaction .    in order to compare the structural properties of repulsive confinement with those of lj confinement , we calculate the lateral oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function ( rdf ) defined by @xmath60.\\ ] ] here @xmath61 is the volume , @xmath62 is the distance parallel to the walls between molecules @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the @xmath40-coordinate of the oxygen atom of molecule @xmath63 , and @xmath66 is the dirac delta function . the heaviside functions , @xmath67 , restrict the sum to a pair of oxygen atoms of molecules located in the same slab of thickness @xmath68  nm .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath69 is that @xmath70 is proportional to the probability of finding an oxygen atom in a slab of thickness @xmath71 at a distance @xmath72 ( parallel to the walls ) from a randomly chosen oxygen atom . in a bulk liquid",

    "this behavior is nearly identical to that observed for water confined between lj surfaces , and is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also confirm the structural similarity with lj confinement by calculating the lateral static structure factor @xmath78 , defined as the fourier transform of the lateral rdf @xmath69 , @xmath79 here the @xmath80-vector is the corresponding wave vector in the @xmath81 plane and @xmath72 is the projection of the position vector on the @xmath81 plane . in fig .",

    "the potential energy first increases and then reaches its equilibrium value of the liquid potential energy accompanied by a structural change from a crystal ( presence of sharp bragg peaks ) to a liquid ( absence of bragg peaks ) .    based on this observation , it is tempting to claim that repulsion inhibits crystallization , and that a preferable distance from the wall determined by the attractive portion of the lj potential is necessary to induce crystallization",
    ". however , as discussed above for the same plate separation @xmath6  nm , @xmath0 repulsive confinement with the chosen parameters increases the available space for molecules relative to lj confinement . hence to properly compare the crystallization behavior",
    ", we must adjust the separation of the wall so that the available space for the water molecules is the same in both systems .",

    "in addition to examining the stability of initially crystalline structures , we also consider whether freezing from the liquid state occurs when we have the same effective plate separation .",
