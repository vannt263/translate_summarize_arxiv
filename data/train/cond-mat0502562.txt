    "@xmath111 should lie lower in energy .",
    "however , the well - defined maximum in @xmath112 at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath113100 k ) points to an effective large degeneracy ( this is clear from bethe - ansatz results in the isotropic case.@xcite ) as a compromise , we took a four - fold degenerate ground state of @xmath58 , containing the states with @xmath114 and @xmath115 along @xmath21 ( all belonging to the same irreducible representation ) .",
    "the remaining four states were also assumed degenerate . allowing these quartets to split into closely spaced doublets does not qualitatively change the results .",
    "a larger admixture with the 4f@xmath56 configuration ( lower @xmath107 ) decreases both susceptibilities but increases relatively the upturn in @xmath116 as pointed out earlier.@xcite    the structure of the compounds suggest a larger hybridization for orbitals lying in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath21 axis , which should correspond to higher @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we begin our fitting procedure with two different values of @xmath117 , with the larger value corresponding to the ground state quartet . increasing @xmath117 for both quartets",
    "leads to flatter curves and more similar values of @xmath112 and @xmath118 . as indicated in table [ props ] , a single hybridization parameter ( i.e. , @xmath119 is sufficient to produce a high quality fit to the data for yb@xmath0ir@xmath8ga@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ chiir ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the included crystal field splitting is essential for describing the data .",
    "as the overall hybridization decreases from yb@xmath0ir@xmath8ga@xmath2 to yb@xmath0rh@xmath8ga@xmath2 , the need for level - specific hybridization becomes apparent . in order to adequately fit the susceptibility of yb@xmath0rh@xmath8ga@xmath2 , especially the in - plane susceptibility ( @xmath120 ) , a quartet - specific hybridization had to be included",
    "this is shown most clearly in fig .",
    "[ calc ] . here , we show best fits to the measured data using three calculation approaches , that of the traditional bethe - ansatz , the nca with a single hybridization that was used for yb@xmath0ir@xmath8ga@xmath2 , and the nca allowing for a different hybridization of the upper cef quartet than that of the lower cef quartet ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "our theoretical approach also enables the calculation of @xmath45 , the low - temperature electronic contribution to specific heat . using the best model parameters of table [ props ] , we find 68 mj / mol yb k@xmath122 and 28 mj / mol yb k@xmath122 for yb@xmath0rh@xmath8ga@xmath2 and yb@xmath0ir@xmath8ga@xmath2 , respectively , in reasonable agreement with measured values [ @xmath123 mj / mol - yb k@xmath41 for m = rh ( ir ) ] .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the quasielastic linewidth and x - ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of @xmath124 are presently in progress to further validate our model.@xcite      in summary , measurements of magnetic susceptibility , specific heat , and electrical resistivity have been performed on the mixed - valence compounds yb@xmath0rh@xmath8ga@xmath2 and yb@xmath0ir@xmath8ga@xmath2 .",
