    ", we set the domain size to be equal to the lattice size , i.e. @xmath60 so the diffusion coefficients coincide with the mobility rates .",
    "it is important to note that apart from the nonspatial ode @xmath331 and a linear diffusive term @xmath332 there are also additional nonlinear diffusive terms appearing in the second line of ( [ equ : pdes ] ) .",

    "in this appendix , we provide details of the multi - scale asymptotic expansion leading to the complex ginzburg  landau equation ( [ cgle ] ) which provides a controlled ( perturbative ) approximation of the model s dynamics in the vicinity of the hopf bifurcation .      before performing the asymptotic expansion",

    "one notices that @xmath340 decouples from the oscillations in the @xmath341-@xmath342 at hopf frequency @xmath343 .",
    "the dynamics of three species abundances is therefore confined to two dimensions , which simplifies the multiscale expansion .",
    "once the linear transformation ( [ m ] ) is performed onto , we are interested in small perturbations of magnitude @xmath235 around the hopf bifurcation by writing  @xcite @xmath344 unlike the strained coordinate method , the expansion assumes a general undetermined functional dependence on the new multiscale coordinates . as well - established in the theory of weakly nonlinear systems  @xcite , the first step of the derivation is the multiscale expansion of time and space coordinates , e.g. @xmath345 and @xmath346 in one spatial dimension .",

    "furthermore , the variable @xmath351 is expanded in the perturbation parameter @xmath235 .",
    "the expansion , up to the order @xmath90 where the cgle is expected to appear , reads @xmath352 as a results of these expansions , all scaling in @xmath235 is made explicit with the variables @xmath353 , @xmath354 and @xmath86 for all @xmath355 , being of order @xmath356 .    using the chain rule with the multiscale variables two times with @xmath285 , @xmath357 and similarly for @xmath358 with @xmath359 results in a hierarchy of simple equations which can be solved at different orders of @xmath235 with necessary removals of the secular terms .",
    "these unbound terms arise naturally when the perturbation theory is applied to weakly nonlinear problems and their removal gives additional information about the system dynamics .",
    "moreover , the jordan normal form suggests that the first two components of @xmath360 should be combined into a complex number @xmath361 the hierarchy of simplified equations begins at the leading order @xmath362 where the first set of the equations reads @xmath363 these equations suggest oscillating and decaying solutions with the following ansatz proposed @xmath364 where @xmath365 is the complex amplitude modulation at the `` slow '' time and length scales . here",

    "obtains @xmath369 , which corresponds to the leading term for the invariant manifold considered in @xcite . continuing this procedure to order @xmath90 ,",
    "a secular term is encountered .",
    "canceling such a term yields the cgle for @xmath365  @xcite , which can be written as @xmath370 where the constants in the coefficient of the `` cubic '' @xmath371 term are @xmath372 it is convenient to define an effective diffusion constant @xmath373 in terms of the divorced mobility rates @xmath50 and @xmath49 such that @xmath374 the form of the combined constant @xmath373 gives clues to the contributions from the two diffusion rates weighted by the reaction rates @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "this shows an intuitive relation between migration and biological processes .",
    "for example , when reproduction is high for @xmath100 , exchange of habitat dominates due to lack of empty space . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath375 , diffusive migration dominates as aggressive predation leaves the ecosystem mostly unoccupied .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath373 can be set to unity by rescaling @xmath354 which changes the sizes of the overall patterns in the domain without affecting their dynamics ( see main text ) .",
    "finally , eq .   is simplified by rescaling @xmath376 and introducing the sole parameter @xmath377 to give the final form of the cgle ( [ cgle ] ) .",
    "thus , the remaining parameter @xmath96 combines the reaction rates from the generic metapopulation model in the following way @xmath378 which is the expression of ( [ c3 ] ) .",
