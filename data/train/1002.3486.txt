    ", the number of available spectra of emission - line galaxies has increased dramatically due to the completion of several large spectral surveys .",
    "measurements of emission lines in those spectra have been carried out for abundance determinations and investigation of the luminosity  metallicity relation .",
    "thus , @xcite have considered the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation for 519 galaxies in the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) , @xcite for 6,387 galaxies in the 2df galaxy survey , @xcite for about 53,000 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and @xcite for 82,302 sdss galaxies .",
    "it has been found , however , that , when mass can be determined , the mass - metallicity correlation is considerably tighter than the luminosity ",
    "metallicity correlation , suggesting that mass may be a more meaningful physical parameter than luminosity . in the last decade",
    ", the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation with redshift has been examined by many investigators @xcite . in those investigations , oxygen abundances",
    "have been derived using various methods .",
    "the general conclusion from those studies is that the oxygen abundance change of star - forming galaxies over the last half of the age of the universe appears to be somewhat moderate , with @xmath10(log(o / h ) ) @xmath3 0.3 or lower .",
    "this change is comparable to or less than the scatter in the observed oxygen abundances ( see fig.10 of @xcite , fig.13 of @xcite , and fig.6 of @xcite ) .    until now",
    ", no attention has been paid to the redshift evolution of nitrogen abundances in galaxies , despite the fact that they present several advantages for the study of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "first , since at 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 8.3 , secondary nitrogen becomes dominant and the nitrogen abundance increases at a faster rate than the oxygen abundance @xcite , then the change in nitrogen abundances with redshift should show a larger amplitude in comparison to oxygen abundances and , as a consequence , should be easier to detect .",
    "furthermore , there is a time delay in the nitrogen production as compared to oxygen production @xcite .",
    "this provides an additional constraint on the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "these reasons have led us to consider here not only the redshift evolution of oxygen abundances but also that of nitrogen abundances .",
    "to carry out such an investigation , it is necessary to derive accurate oxygen and nitrogen abundances .",
    "the emission line properties of photoionized hii regions are governed by its heavy element content and by the electron temperature distribution within the photoionized nebula . in turn , the latter is controlled by the ionizing star cluster spectral energy distribution and by the chemical composition of the hii region .",
    "the evolution of a giant extragalactic hii region associated with a star cluster is thus caused by a gradual change in time of the integrated stellar energy distribution due to stellar evolution .",

    "the general conclusion from those studies is that hii regions ionized by star clusters form a well - defined fundamental sequence in different emission - line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the existence of such a fundamental sequence forms the basis of various investigations of extragalactic hii regions .",
    "first , @xcite have suggested that the position of an object in some well - chosen emission - line diagrams can be used to separate hii regions ionized by star clusters from other types of emission - line objects .",
    "this idea has found general acceptance and use .",
    "thus , the [ oiii]@xmath115007/h@xmath12 vs [ nii]@xmath116584/h@xmath13 diagram has been used widely to distinguish between star - forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "in particular , the sdss emission - line galaxies occupy a well - defined region shaped like the wings of a seagull @xcite .",
    "the left wing consists of star - forming galaxies while the right wing is attributed to agns .",
    "however , the exact location of the dividing line between hii regions and agns is still controversial @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the positions of hii regions in some emission - line diagrams can be calibrated in terms of their oxygen abundances .",
    "this approach to abundance determination in hii regions , usually referred to as the `` strong line method '' has been widely adopted , especially in cases where the temperature - sensitive [ o iii ] @xmath114363 line is not detected .",

    "indeed , when only one electron temperature , t@xmath15 or t@xmath16 , is measured ( t@xmath15 and t@xmath16 being the electron temperatures in the [ o iii ] and [ o ii ] zones , respectively ) it is standard practice to use a t@xmath16  t@xmath15 relation to estimate the other temperature .",
    "this relation is usually established on the basis of hii regions models which belong to the same fundamental sequence .",
    "our study will be based on the sdss data base of a million spectra . to study the redshift evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances , accurate oxygen and nitrogen abundance determinations are mandatory .",
    "the determination of accurate abundances in hii regions from sdss spectra poses two problems .",
    "first , line fluxes in sdss spectra are measured by an automatic procedure .",
    "this inevitably introduces large flux errors for some objects .",
    "we need to devise a way to recognize those objects and exclude them from consideration .",
    "second , the sdss galaxy spectra span a large range of redshifts .",
    "there is thus an aperture - redshift effect in sdss spectra .",
    "indeed , they are obtained with 3-arcsec - diameter fibers . at a redshift of @xmath4=0.05",
    "the projected aperture diameter is @xmath3 3 kpc , while it is @xmath3 15 kpc at a redshift of @xmath4=0.25 .",
    "this means that , at large redshifts , sdss spectra are closer to global spectra of whole galaxies , i.e. to that of composite nebulae including multiple star clusters , rather than to spectra of individual hii regions .",
    "one should then expect that some sdss objects will not follow the fundamental hii region sequence .",
    "these need also to be identified and excluded from our sample .",
    "we propose here a method to recognize objects that suffer from one or both of these problems .",
    "it is based on the idea that if _ i ) _ an object belongs to the fundamental hii region sequence , and _",

    "the presence of a metallicity plateau in the m@xmath38o / h diagram at all redshifts implies then that the high - mass sdss galaxies have very similar gas mass fractions .",
    "the luminosity  central metallicity relation for nearby spiral galaxies also shows a plateau at high luminosities @xcite .",
    "this plateau was interpreted as evidence that the gas in the centers of the most metal - rich galaxies has been almost completely converted into stars and that the oxygen abundance in the centers of the most luminous metal - rich galaxies has reached its maximum attainable value of 12+log(o / h ) @xmath3 8.87 .",
    "the plateau for oxygen abundances in the sdss galaxies is at the level of 12+log(o / h)=8.67 , i.e. 0.2 dex smaller .",
    "the simple model of chemical evolution of galaxies predicts that a decrease of @xmath53 by 0.1 results in an increase of oxygen abundance by @xmath30.13 dex , in the range of @xmath53 from @xmath30.50 to @xmath3 0.05 @xcite .",
    "then , the difference between the maximum attainable value of the oxygen abundance and the mean oxygen abundance in high - mass sdss galaxies , @xmath10(log(o / h ) ) @xmath3 0.2 , corresponds to a difference in gas mass fraction @xmath10@xmath53 @xmath3 0.15 .",
    "since the maximum attainable oxygen value corresponds to complete astration , i.e. @xmath53 = 0 , the mean @xmath53 in high - mass sdss galaxies at the present epoch should be @xmath3 15% , with a probable range of @xmath53 from @xmath3 5% to @xmath3 25% .",
    "why do our sdss subsamples not contain galaxies with abundances as high as the maximum attainable value ?",
    "the reason has to do with the gas content of the sdss galaxies in our subsamples .",
    "as said before , the maximum attainable value of the oxygen abundance corresponds to the limiting case where the gas has been completely converted into stars .",
    "the galaxies in our sdss subsamples are all characterized by strong emission lines in their spectra , meaning that they are undergoing strong starbursts .",
    "this requires in turn that they contain an appreciable amount of gas . in other words , because our galaxies are gas - rich , they have not reached the maximum attainable value of the oxygen abundance which requires complete gas exhaustion .",
    "if galaxies were not gas - rich , they would have weak emission lines , unlikely to be measured accurately .",
    "there exists thus a lower limit on the gas mass fraction for a galaxy to have accurately measured lines and to be included in our subsamples . in that sense ,",
    "the observed plateau is likely affected by the selection criteria .",
    "we note however that , even in the most evolved nearby spiral galaxies , the hii region oxygen abundances are generally lower than the maximum attainable value .",
    "there is furthermore an aperture effect that slightly lowers the metallicities observed for sdss galaxies .",
    "the maximum attainable value oxygen abundance observed in the central part of some nearby galaxies is usually derived by linearly fitting the variations of h ii region abundances with galactocentric distance , and extrapolating to r=0 . in the distant sdss galaxies , because one fiber includes many hii regions that show decreasing metallicities towards larger galactocentric distances , the oxygen abundances are slightly diluted when averaged over a large region .    in the lower panel of fig.[figure : zmohb ] , we compare the m@xmath38o / h relation for local ( @xmath4 @xmath54 0.05 ) galaxies ( solid line ) with that for distant ( @xmath4 @xmath54 0.25 ) ones ( dashed line ) .",
    "three features are to be noted .",
    "first , it can be seen that , for the galaxies of highest stellar masses , those with masses @xmath0 10@xmath7m@xmath2 , the plateau value of the oxygen abundance does not change in the redshift interval from 0.05 to 0.25 .",
    "this implies that the galaxies of highest mass in our sdss subsamples have reached their highest astration level some 3 gyr ago , and have been somewhat `` lazy '' in their evolution afterwards .",
    "second , for lower mass galaxies with stellar masses @xmath6",
    "10@xmath7m@xmath2 , it is seen that the value of the oxygen enrichment during the last 3 gyr increases with decreasing galaxy mass , in the mass interval from 10@xmath7m@xmath2 to 10@xmath52m@xmath2 , as shown by the widening gap between the solid and dashed curves toward lower masses . at m@xmath38=10@xmath52m@xmath2",

    "the dependence of the nitrogen abundance on galaxy stellar mass for m@xmath38 @xmath36 m@xmath46 is considerably steeper than that for oxygen abundances .",

    "intriguingly , there are other types of observations that also suggest that stars in the 1.5  2 m@xmath2 mass range contribute to nitrogen enrichment . @xcite",
    "have found that planetary nebulae in nearby galaxies ( with or without ongoing star formation ) often show large nitrogen enrichments .",
    "they have argued that these planetary nebulae are the descendants of relatively low mass progenitors , of approximately 1.5m@xmath2 or less , i.e. that low- and intermediate - mass stars are a more important source of nitrogen than has been hitherto considered .",
    "thus , our conclusion that stars with lifetimes of a few gyr contribute to the nitrogen production , derived from the consideration of the nitrogen abundance evolution with redshift in galaxies , is in line with the conclusions of other types of investigations .",
    "while stellar evolution theory does not yet predict nitrogen production in stars with masses of @xmath3 1.5  2 m@xmath8 , several lines of observations now do so .",
    "the redshift evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances in emission - line sdss galaxies has been studied .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the construction of our galaxy sample , using the mpa / jhu catalogs of line flux measurements and other derived physical properties for sdss galaxies .",
    "we have devised a way to recognize and exclude from consideration not only agns , but also star - forming galaxies with large errors in their line flux measurements .",
    "we have found that the requirement that nitrogen abundances , derived with different calibration relations based on different emission lines , agree , can be used as a reliable criterion to select star - forming galaxies with accurate line fluxes measurements .",
    "we have derived relations between nitrogen abundances and the abundance - sensitive n@xmath16 , n@xmath16/r@xmath16 , and n@xmath16/r@xmath15 indexes .",
    "those relations have been used to determine nitrogen abundances in the sdss galaxies .",
    "the small dispersion among the various derived nitrogen abundances for a given galaxy is used as a criterion to select star - forming galaxies with accurate line fluxes measurements .",
    "the relations between the electron temperature t@xmath16 and the n@xmath16 , n@xmath16/r@xmath16 , and n@xmath16/r@xmath15 indexes have also been established .",
    "those calibrations have been used to estimate the n / o ratio and derive the oxygen abundances o / h from the nitrogen abundances",
    "subsamples of star - forming sdss galaxies have been extracted from the mpa / jhu catalogs , using the small nitrogen abundance dispersion criterion described above .",
    "the nitrogen and oxygen abundances are estimated for these galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the oxygen and nitrogen abundances with redshift and galaxy stellar mass of galaxy are investigated , that of nitrogen abundances for the first time .",
    "we have obtained the following main results .",
    "+ 1 ) the galaxies of highest masses ( those more massive than @xmath3 10@xmath1m@xmath2 ) do not show an appreciable enrichment in both oxygen and nitrogen from @xmath4=0.25 to @xmath4=0.05 .",
    "those galaxies have reached their high astration level in such a distant past that their stars have returned their nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium before @xmath4=0.25 .",
    "+ 2 ) the galaxies in the mass range from @xmath3 10@xmath5m@xmath2 to @xmath3 10@xmath1m@xmath2 do not show an oxygen enrichment , but do show some enrichment in nitrogen .",
    "those galaxies also formed stars before @xmath4=0.25 , but at a later epoch in comparison to the galaxies of highest masses .",
    "their stars have not returned nitrogen to the interstellar medium before @xmath4=0.25 because they have not had enough time to evolve .",
    "+ 3 ) the galaxies with masses lower than @xmath3 10@xmath7m@xmath2 show enrichment in both oxygen and nitrogen abundances over the redshift period from @xmath4=0.25 to @xmath4=0.05 , i.e. during the last 3 gyr .",
    "the oxygen enrichment increases with decreasing galaxy mass , from 10@xmath7m@xmath2 to m@xmath38=10@xmath52m@xmath2 .",
    "it reaches a value @xmath10log(o / h ) @xmath3 0.25 at m@xmath38=10@xmath52m@xmath2 and slightly decreases with further decrease of galaxy mass . the nitrogen enrichment increases with decreasing galaxy mass , from @xmath3 10@xmath7m@xmath2 to @xmath3 10@xmath57m@xmath2 .",
    "it reaches a value @xmath10log(n / h ) @xmath3 0.65 at @xmath3 10@xmath57m@xmath2 and slightly decreases with further decrease of galaxy mass .",
    "significant star formation has occurred in those galaxies during the last 3 gyr .",
    "they have converted up to 20% of their total mass to stars over this period .",
    "+ 4 ) stars with lifetimes of 23 gyr , i.e. in the 1.5  2 m@xmath2 mass range , contribute to the nitrogen production .",
    "this is not in agreement with current stellar evolutionary models of intermediate mass stars which predict that stars in the 3  8 m@xmath2 mass range do the job , not stars in the 1.5  2 m@xmath2 mass range .",
    "+ 5 ) the general picture of the oxygen abundance evolution with redshift and galaxy stellar mass obtained here and in previous work is confirmed and strengthened by consideration of the nitrogen abundance evolution .",
