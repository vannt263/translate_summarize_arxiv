    "quantum fluctuations are the main factor limiting the precision of many measurements and the signal - to - noise ratio in optical communication . however , shot - noise is not a fundamental restriction on the precision of an optical measurement if nonclassical states of light are used  @xcite .",
    "for example , squeezed vacuum has been used to improve the performance of optical interferometers beyond the shot - noise limit  @xcite .",

    "it has been known for some time that if linearly polarized light propagates through a medium that can produce nonlinear self - rotation ( sr ) of elliptically polarized light ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the light will be in a squeezed state after traversal of the medium if losses in the medium are sufficiently small .",
    "a detailed theoretical study of this effect for a generic kerr medium without absorption was carried out in ref .",
    ". it can be difficult to achieve efficient squeezing in a realistic kerr medium because of the absorption and scattering of light .",
    "nonetheless , squeezed electromagnetic vacuum was recently produced in a nonbirefringent optical fiber in which elliptically polarized light undergoes sr  @xcite .    in this paper , we derive a simple formula for the amount of squeezing generated by a medium which exhibits self - rotation , including the effects of absorption ( which acts to diminish the squeezing ) . in atomic vapors , one can take advantage of resonant enhancement of self - rotation ( as well as coherence and interference effects  @xcite ) to create a medium in which there is large sr and small absorption . employing density - matrix calculations ,",
    "we analyze vacuum squeezing of resonant light in some low - angular - momentum atomic systems and in atomic rubidium .",
    "we find that under readily achievable experimental conditions , vacuum squeezing of about 8  db can be expected .",
    "before embarking on the calculations , we present a qualitative explanation of why self - rotation leads to squeezing .",
    "suppose that we have a strong linearly polarized ( along @xmath1 ) light field propagating in the @xmath2 direction through a medium in which elliptically polarized light would undergo sr .",
    "also suppose there is a weak co - propagating @xmath3-polarized light field .",
    "in general , the resultant field is elliptically polarized and the principal axis of the polarization ellipse will rotate upon propagation through the medium .",
    "this rotation projects a portion of the strong field along @xmath4 . depending on the relative phase between the orthogonally - polarized strong and weak input fields , the @xmath3-polarized output field can be amplified or attenuated compared to the weak input field ( phase - sensitive gain or loss ) . in the latter case , we have a negative feedback mechanism which reduces the field along @xmath4 .",
    "this analysis applies even when the weak input field is solely due to vacuum fluctuations .    to describe squeezing that accompanies propagation of light through a nonlinear sr - medium , we first introduce a phenomenological description of sr .",

    "further analysis is required to determine the exact physical mechanism for enhancement of squeezing in this particular case .",

    "@xcite , vacuum squeezing via sr has been analyzed in the case of the double-@xmath207 system , a model system in which atomic coherence and interference effects as well as multi - transition effects play important roles .",
    "stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) may limit the light intensity which can be used , since for sufficiently high light intensities , srs can convert a significant portion of the incident light power into new frequencies .",
    "in addition to the depletion of the input light beam , nonlinear instabilities associated with srs may introduce extra noise .",
    "estimates indicate that the parameters employed in the calculations yielding figs .  [ rb87d1squeezing ] and [ rb87d2squeezing ]",
    "are in the regime where srs becomes significant , so additional analysis is required to determine the manner in which srs affects the obtainable squeezing .    in a complete analysis of the noise properties of the light field , in addition to the absorptive properties of the atomic medium , one must account for the effect of the quantum noise of atomic states ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "estimates indicate that in the high light power , high atomic density regime where the best vacuum squeezing is obtained ( see also sec .",
    "[ squeezenumbers ] ) , noise related to these effects is small enough that it should not degrade the predicted squeezing .",
    "we have shown that when linearly polarized light propagates through a medium in which there is nonlinear self - rotation of elliptically polarized light , the vacuum electromagnetic field in the orthogonal polarization is squeezed .",
    "we have derived a simple expression [ eq .",
    "( [ squeezeparm ] ) ] for the ratio of the amplitude of vacuum fluctuations at the output of the medium to those at the input under optimum conditions .",
    "density matrix calculations performed for relatively simple atomic systems indicate that under realistic conditions it should be possible to achieve @xmath208 .",
    "we have compared various experimental systems , such as trapped and cooled atoms and buffer - gas - filled cells , finding that with presently achievable experimental parameters , none of the considered techniques offer substantial improvement over buffer - gas - free vapor cells .",
    "we have also performed calculations showing that vacuum squeezing of up to 6  db should be achievable in vapors of @xmath192rb with the experimental setups used in refs .",
