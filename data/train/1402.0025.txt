    "molecular junctions in which a single molecule forms a stable electrically conducting bridge between two metal electrodes have been studied intensively experimentally and theoretically for more than a decade due to their fundamental interest and potential device applications @xcite .",
    "achieving control over the electronic transport properties of these nanostructures is crucial for the realization of practical single - molecule electronic devices .",
    "the electronic conductances of molecular junctions are sensitive to their atomic geometries.@xcite these geometries can be modified by varying the separation between the two metal electrodes of the molecular junction , and this approach has been used to modulate the conductances of a variety of molecular junctions including those in which benzenedithiolate ( bdt),@xcite octanedithiolate , @xcite bipyridine@xcite or propanedithiolate ( pdt ) @xcite molecules bridge a pair of gold electrodes . in the case of au - bdt - au ,",
    "conductance changes of more than three orders of magnitude have been achieved in this way.@xcite thus bdt has been proposed recently as a candidate for applications as a broad range coherent molecular conductor with tunable conductance.@xcite however , despite its great importance for molecular electronics , the present day understanding of the relationship between the structure and electronic transport characteristics of molecular junctions remains far from complete .",
    "for example , intuitively , one might expect the conductance of a molecular junction to decrease as the junction is stretched and the interatomic bonds within it are weakened and therefore become less conducting . however , a recent experiment @xcite on au - bdt - au junctions has demonstrated that , surprisingly , this need not always be the case and that , to the contrary , stretching these junctions can result in their conductances _ increasing _ by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this increase in the conductance was attributed @xcite to a strain - induced shift of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) towards the fermi level of the electrodes resulting in resonant tunneling , as was predicted by theories of the dependence of the homo energy on the molecule - electrode separation , i.e. , the au - s bond length .",
    "@xcite however , another recent study @xcite has indicated that the conductance of au - bdt - au junctions is controlled mainly by the strength of the molecule - electrode coupling rather than by the energy of a molecular electronic level .",
    "most recently it has been proposed@xcite that gold atomic chains formed at the molecule - electrode interfaces when the junction is stretched may be responsible for the large increase observed@xcite in the conductance .",
    "thus the origin of the observed behavior@xcite remains controversial .",
    "interestingly , the conductances of au - pdt - au junctions have also been found experimentally to increase as the junctions are stretched at cryogenic temperatures@xcite .",
    "while the bonding geometries between the molecule and gold electrodes in au - bdt - au junctions have not as yet been determined experimentally and remain the subject of conjecture , @xcite experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite inelastic tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) studies have determined the experimentally realized molecule - gold bonding geometries in au - pdt - au junctions .",
    "for this reason au - pdt - au junctions may be more amenable as model systems for developing a _ definitive _ understanding of the counter - intuitive increase of the conductance as the junction is stretched .",
    "we therefore explore this phenomenon in au - pdt - au junctions theoretically in this article .",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the molecular configuration , contact geometry , and molecular conductance , as the junction is stretched .",
    "we find the calculated conductance to increase by factors consistent with experiment,@xcite as the junction is stretched . before the junction ruptures",
    "we find the conductance to _ decrease _ , also as in the experiment.@xcite we find the conductance to decrease shortly before and during the formation of a gold atomic chain at a molecule - electrode interface , but that the conductance increase resumes with further stretching once an atomic chain has formed .",
    "however , we find the conductance increases for junctions with atomic chains to be somewhat smaller than for those without them .",
    "we show the increasing conductance as the junction is stretched to be due mainly to increasing au - s - c bond angles at the molecule - electrode interfaces and strains in the electrodes ( geometrical changes that are expected to occur in many molecular junctions under tensile stress ) rather than to atomic chain formation or elongation of the au - s bonds .",
    "we find the latter to be too small to affect the measured conductance@xcite strongly .",
    "we study the evolution of the molecular junction s geometry as the au - pdt - au junction is stretched by carrying out _ ab initio _ calculations of the relaxed geometries of extended molecules each consisting of a pdt molecule and two 14-atom gold clusters bound to the pdt sulfur atoms as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "our previous work @xcite showed the electronic transport properties of au - pdt - au extended molecules to have converged sufficiently with increasing gold cluster size that 14-atom gold clusters can serve as a realistic model of the macroscopic gold electrodes that contact the pdt molecule in experiments.@xcite our starting point is the relaxed geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) that our iets studies @xcite identified as having the gold - sulfur bonding geometry that was most commonly realized in experiments @xcite on au - pdt - au junctions .",
    "the other structures that we considered were generated from this one by moving the atom of each gold cluster that was furthest from the molecule slightly further from or closer to the molecule and then freezing the positions of these two outer atoms and relaxing the positions of all of the other atoms of the extended molecule .",
    "this procedure was iterated to produce relaxed junction geometries with differing distances between the two outer au atoms .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the relaxations were all carried out using the gaussian 09 package with the b3pw91 functional and lanl2dz pseudopotentials and basis sets @xcite to locate local minima of the total energy of the extended molecule computed within density functional theory .    since our approach to calculating the molecular junction geometries is fully quantum mechanical and the total energies of the trial geometries sampled in the relaxation process",
    "are computed within density functional theory , our relaxed geometries are expected to be more accurate than those obtained using computationally less demanding methods that employ parameterized interatomic potentials and classical mechanics , such as those in ref . .    since our geometry relaxations were performed effectively at zero temperature , the relaxed structures that we obtained",

    "transport is _ not _ a ground state property .",
    "for this reason dft - based transport calculations are not well justified at the fundamental level and the results obtained from them in practice are often unreliable.@xcite attempts are being made to correct for these limitations of dft,@xcite however , these corrections involve uncontrolled approximations and their effectiveness is uncertain at this time",

    "the formation of this chain with @xmath23  again results in an abrupt drop in the conductance to the value labeled f@xmath18 in fig .",

    "our numerical results show that the responses of the electronic energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the extended molecule to stretching of the junction both contribute to the rises in the conductance .",
    "the details are complex since several pairs of almost degenerate eigenstates mediate conduction through the molecule and the contributions of the two states of each degenerate pair interfere destructively with each other .",

    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] by rigidly rotating the 14 ( 1)-atom gold clusters about the s atoms . ]    however , we shall show that the physics underlying conductance increases as the junction is stretched can be identified by examining the relationship between the conductance and the geometrical changes that occur in the junction . stretching results in changes in the chemical bond lengths and bond angles in the junction .",
    "for example , when the junction length increases from @xmath21  to 32.80  ( i.e. , from d to e@xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) , the s - au bond lengths increase by only a small amount ( 0.05  ) , while the c - s - au bond angles at the left ( right ) end of the molecule change from 110.15@xmath25 to 118.60@xmath25 ( 108.07@xmath25 to 119.40@xmath25 ) , indicating that most of the elongation is due to changes in bond angles .",
    "importantly , during this elongation the conductance of the junction increases by a factor of @xmath26 but we find that only a small @xmath27 conductance change can be attributed to the elongation of the au - s bonds .",
    "we find that much greater elongation of the au - s bonds ( by 0.6  ) would result in large conductance increases ( by factors @xmath28 ) due to a transport resonance approaching the electrode fermi level , qualitatively similar to the findings of previous theories relating the conductance of au - bdt - au junctions to the molecule - electrode separation .",
    "@xcite however , our _ ab initio _ junction geometry calculations show such large au - s bond elongations to be an order of magnitude larger than those predicted to be realized during the experimental conductance measurements @xcite , and therefore not relevant to the observed conductance increases .",
    "thus we turn now to the role of the bond angles in the conductance .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows the dependence on the junction length @xmath14 of the c - s - au angles , and also the s - au - au and au - au - au angles when an au atomic chain forms .",
    "the corresponding angles at the left and right ends of the molecule ( solid and hollow circles ) are very similar . the dependence of the c - s - au bond angles ( blue circles ) in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] on the junction length @xmath14 is strikingly similar to that of the conductance in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ; the main features of either plot are reproduced in the other almost quantitatively .",
    "in contrast , although the s - au - au and au - au - au angles depend on @xmath14 and the latter angle even changes by more than 30@xmath25 in the stretching process , the role of these angles is not crucial in the conductance increase , since conduction through au atoms is mainly via the isotropic @xmath29 orbitals .    to better understand the role of the bond angles",
    ", we chose two junctions marked a and c in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] .",
    "for these we computed the dependence of the conductance on the c - s - au angles _ alone _ , varying these angles by rotating the gold clusters rigidly about the s atoms , holding the pdt molecule fixed .",
    "this yielded the solid curves in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "these plots show that for each structure a or c the dependence of the conductance on the c - s - au angles accounts for roughly half of the conductance change between a@xmath18 and c@xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , the remainder being due mainly to the structural differences between the a and c gold clusters . a similar calculation but including only one au atom from each au cluster yielded the dashed curves in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "since the difference between the dashed red and blue curves is small and is due to the stretching of the au - s bonds and structural changes within the pdt molecule itself in going between structures a and c , we conclude that these effects make at most minor contributions to the conductance increase when the junction is stretched .",
    "as has been discussed above , we find the conductances of au - pdt - au junctions to increase by similar amounts as the junction is stretched , whether a gold atomic chain is present at the interface between the molecule and one of the gold electrodes , or at the interfaces between the molecule and both of the gold electrodes , or at neither interface .",
    "however , the maximal value of this conductance increase is somewhat larger if there is no gold atomic chain present than in either of the latter two cases .",
    "by contrast in ref .",
    "it has been predicted that for au - bdt - au junctions the conductance increase in response to stretching of the junction is much larger if a gold atomic chain forms than if it does not .",
    "the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "for this very large conductance increase is unrelated to the mechanism of conductance enhancement in au - pdt - au junctions that we propose in the present article .",
    "the conductance increase predicted in ref .",
    "is due to a strong feature in the au @xmath29 and @xmath30 density of states of the atomic chains near the fermi energy that results in enhanced electron transmission through the molecular junction .",
    "some caution regarding this prediction is in order since it is the result of dft - based transport calculations although a self - interaction correction intended to address some of the deficiencies of dft was included in the calculation.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have presented a systematic exploration of the response of the conductance of propanedithiolate molecular nanowires bridging gold electrodes to mechanical stretching of this junction , based on _ ab initio _ density functional theory and semi - empirical techniques .",
    "our results demonstrate theoretically that the counterintuitive phenomenon of increasing conductance in response to junction elongation should occur in a gold - alkanedithiolate - gold junction .",
    "we showed that three different junction geometries can each show a conductance increase in response to junction elongation followed by a conductance decrease and either rupture or a transition to a different junction geometry . a very similar conductance increase followed by a decrease and",
    "subsequent junction rupture has been observed experimentally in an au - pdt - au junction and can be seen in fig .",
    "4a of ref . .",
    "we showed the conductance increases to be due primarily to increases in the c - s - au bond angles at the molecule - electrode interfaces and to atomic rearrangements in the gold electrodes .",
    "conductance increases in response to increasing c - s - au bond angles are reasonable because of the important role that carbon and sulfur atomic valence @xmath30-orbitals play in transport through organic molecules and the anisotropic nature of the overlaps between these orbitals on different atoms .",
    "for this reason we expect the mechanism of the conductance increase under tensile stress that we have identified to be active in all molecular junctions with molecules thiol bonded in a similar way to gold electrodes .",
    "therefore we predict that this interesting phenomenon is a universal generic property of such junctions .",
    "we have also demonstrated that changes in the au - s bond length and in the structure of the propanedithiolate molecule that occur in response to elongation of the junction play a minor role in the observed conductance increase .",
    "our findings also demonstrate that electron transport through the pdt molecule can be controlled by varying the length of the junction and that both continuous modulation of the conductance and abrupt switching between high and low conductance states can be induced in this way .",
    "these remarkable changes in the molecular conductance indicate that alkanedithiol molecular nanowires have potential applications as mechanical switches in nanoscale devices ."
