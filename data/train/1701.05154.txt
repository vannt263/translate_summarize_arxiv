    "thermal systems of particles driven by exclusion forces are governed solely by entropy and show interesting behaviours @xcite .",

    "phase @xcite , an exotic biaxial phase with two ( instead of one ) perpendicular , equivalent directors .",
    "the stability of the tetratic phase stems from the particularly favourable perpendicular arrangements of particles with sharp corners . for high @xmath1 particles",
    "form phases with partial ( and eventually full ) spatial order , although the exact phase diagram of , in particular , hard rectangular particles , and the dependence with aspect ratio , has not been studied in detail .    horizontally vibrated monolayers of granular , dissipative particles have been shown to exhibit patterns that resemble those of thermal equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "granular rods of various shapes show liquid - crystal arrangements at high @xmath1 .",
    "in one recent experiment @xcite , the transition from a fully disordered ( isotropic ) phase to the uniaxial nematic or tetratic phase has been characterised from the behaviour of standard order parameters obtained from adequate averages of particle orientation distributions .",
    "depending on the aspect ratio , the isotropic was shown to order into a tetratic ( low @xmath0 ) or uniaxial nematic ( high @xmath0 ) phase as @xmath1 was increased .",
    "the critical aspect ratio @xmath2 that separates the two ordered phases was estimated to be @xmath3 .",
    "this is much higher than the value predicted by mean - field theories ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 , depending on whether three - particle correlations are neglected or not @xcite ) , but close to the results from equilibrium computer simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the value of packing fraction at the isotropic - uniaxial nematic transition in the granular system shows qualitatively significant deviations with respect to the equilibrium ( either mean theory or simulation ) calculations , indicating the existence of genuine non - equilibrium effects associated with dissipation . clearly ,",
    "in this system entropic or exclusion interactions are strongly coupled to dissipation induced by friction and inelastic collisions , and it remains to be seen to what extent entropy - driven and packing effects compete with hydrodynamic granular flow and dissipation to produce the observed ordered patterns . at least for hard spheres , there seem to exist some regimes where mean - field theories and computer simulations for equilibrium thermal hard particles ( i.e. methods based on entropy maximisation ) are useful in discussing results from granular systems .",
    "for example , radial distribution functions of dense systems of granular spheres and discs are quantitatively similar to the corresponding equilibrium systems @xcite , but granular discs show a more complex phase behaviour and a strong phase dependence with respect to the shaking frequency and amplitude @xcite . phase ordering of granular anisometric particles may also be strongly affected by the manner in which energy is injected into the system and dissipated .",
    "in this paper we report on experiments using vibrated monolayer of granular cylindrical particles , which project on the horizontal plate approximately as hard rectangles .",
    "our aim is to assess to what extent the ordered liquid - crystalline patterns predicted for thermal hard rectangles in equilibrium can be observed in the granular experiments . in doing so , we have found a strong dependence on particle aspect ratio of the liquid - crystalline patterns observed , as previously obtained @xcite .",
    "we have found that the tendency for clustering of particles is very strong , and that these effects help explain most of the phenomenology observed , in particular , some of the differences with respect to equilibrium systems .",
    "thus far , clusters and clustering effects in general have not been carefully analysed in experiments on dense packings of vibrated granular rods .",
    "we argue that clustering gives a useful picture to explain the different high - density configurations with respect to aspect ratio .",
    "dense collections of dissipative rectangular particles exhibit a strong tendency to lie parallel to each other , and clusters of approximately parallel particles are formed easily .",
    "these clusters are very stable , and in many respect behave as single units , which we call ` superparticles ' .",
    "the clustering tendency is much stronger than in fluids of equilibrium thermal rods , as demonstrated by comparison with equilibrium monte carlo simulations on thermal particles . in the vibration experiments ,",
    "particles of low aspect ratio , @xmath6 , are seen to form clusters with square or close - to - square shape quite easily , and these superparticles of still lower effective aspect ratio may orient parallel or perpendicular in relatively efficient packing configurations ; bulk tetratic ordering , and smectic at even higher packing fractions , may result .",
    "however , for long rods , @xmath7 , large clusters involve many particles and tend to bend , so that superparticles can not pack into tetratic or uniaxial nematic configurations : randomly oriented arrangements of large clusters or ` patches ' are preferred , which at high density also exhibit smectic fluctuations .",
    "in addition , this granular system features the usual non - equilibrium properties of vibrated monolayers : strong dependence with excitation parameters , formation of cavities and large density fluctuations , hydrodynamic flow competing with ordering , etc . in particular , we do not observe sharp transitions between states with different ordering properties , a result which is at variance with those of ref .",
    ". however , the experiments may not necessarily be in contradiction , given that the experimental conditions of both experiments are not identical and , in addition , different protocols to calculate the order parameters could have been used .",
    "another distinct feature of our experiment is that , in the high - density regime , there is an absence of well - defined steady states , which we explain as a competition between smectic ordering effects due to packing and disordering effects due to excitation of hydrodynamic modes .",
    "finally , an intriguing result is that , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath8@xmath9 is a critical aspect ratio separating two types of orientational ordering , similar to equilibrium . but",
    "clustering effects and the associated formation of superparticles renormalise this value to @xmath10 , a value very close to that predicted by equilibrium mean - field theories .",

    "plastic cylinders were also studied in one case for comparison @xcite .",
    "the packing fraction is calculated as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of cylinders and @xmath15 the area of the circular cavity .",
    "the vibration experiment is standard : particles are inside a cylindrical container , consisting of a thin horizontal cylindrical cavity made of aluminium , with a diameter of 14 cm .",
    "an upper plastic lid limits the free motion of cylinders in the vertical direction , which is @xmath16 , so that particles can not overlap in the plane of the plate .",

    "some frequencies tend to promote the formation of cavities , i.e. persistent regions with very few particles @xcite , even in the high - packing - fraction regime .",
    "we have tried to avoid these states , as well as the dilute regime , by always choosing @xmath23 .     at packing fraction @xmath24 .",
    "particles belonging to the same cluster are drawn as straight lines of the same colour . ]    to analyse the experiments we use standard procedures .",
    "all measured quantities are obtained from the projected coordinates of the cylinders on the plate , @xmath25 , and from the projected orientations of the long particle axis @xmath26 of each particle .",
    "these are obtained by using the imagej software @xcite .",
    "typically 98% of particles are successfully identified .",
    "particle velocities @xmath27 are calculated by identifying particle positions in two consecutive frames , separated by 0.3 s , and using a simple finite - difference approximation .",
    "success in the identification of particle trajectories decreases from 98% for @xmath28 to 85% ( at worst ) for @xmath29 ; the latter case , however , involves a larger number of particles , so that statistical errors are not significantly altered .",

    "the orientational and positional orders in the cell are quantified by the local and global uniaxial nematic , @xmath30 , tetratic , @xmath31 , and smectic , @xmath32 , order parameters .",
    "the nematic and tetratic order parameters were obtained through the orientational distribution @xmath33 , and also through properly defined order tensors .",
    "details on the definition and calculations of these parameters are given in the appendix .",
    "finally , in order to study collective properties of the cylinders from a different perspective , we analysed clustering properties .",
    "this has not been done systematically in vibrated experiments on rods , but we have concluded that these properties are extremely useful .",
    "we define a cluster as a collection of cylinders that are approximately parallel and spatially close to each other .",
    "our connectedness criterion imposes two conditions for two cylinders to be connected : ( i ) their projected long axes form an angle @xmath34 , and ( ii ) their projected geometric centres are at a distance @xmath35 ( we should mention that , as usual in cluster analysis , results turn out not to depend qualitatively on the exact definition of the connectedness criterion ) .",
    "once the connection matrix for the cylinders is established , a standard routine to identify the cluster distribution @xmath36 is used to obtain the average number of clusters @xmath37 of a given size @xmath38 , where @xmath38 is the number of cylinders making up the cluster .",
    "in this section we present results for the different quantities defined in the previous section . in all the experiments particles",
    "were initially placed in the container by hand , trying to achieve a random initial arrangement .",
    "we start by looking at the particle distribution from the point of view of cluster formation . clustering effects",
    "play an important role in dense packings of dissipative rectangular particles .",
    "clustering is known to enhance the tendency for tetratic ordering in dense packings of particles with low @xmath0 at thermal equilibrium .",
    "monte carlo simulations on equilibrium rectangular rods demonstrated this clustering effect @xcite . a theory based on stable , polydisperse clusters with a distribution decaying exponentially with size was shown to lead to good agreement with simulations of equally - sized rectangles @xcite .",

    "although both distributions are close to exponential , @xmath41 , we can see that the cluster distribution of the granular system decays more slowly with cluster size ( approximately a factor 3 in decay parameter ) , indicating the stronger tendency of the granular system to cluster than in the thermal equilibrium system .     as a function of cluster size @xmath38 for @xmath42 particles with @xmath29 at packing fraction @xmath43 in a circular container of diameter @xmath44 cm .",

    "to look at this picture in more detail , we have computed angular distribution functions and corresponding order parameters for the superparticles .",
    "some interesting results emerge from this analysis .",
    "for example , one can calculate an effective mean and dispersion in the aspect ratio of clusters , @xmath109 where the length and width of a cluster is @xmath110 , @xmath111 , with @xmath112 the maximum centre - to - centre distance between two particles in the cluster , and where index @xmath113 runs over all the clusters detected in the stationary regime of the experiment .",
    "[ kappa_media ] shows the behaviour of @xmath114 as a function of @xmath1 for all the particles aspect ratios @xmath0 analysed .",
    "one observes that , for a particular @xmath0 , the effective mean cluster ratio is remarkably insensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "the dispersion @xmath115 ( which is close to the cluster length polydispersity ) is more sensitive to @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ kappa_poly ] .",
    "all of these results suggest that , for a given @xmath0 , the system can be regarded as a mixture of polydisperse superparticles of rather constant aspect ratio and a relatively high polydispersity that increases with density .",
    "but still more interesting is the fact that , in all cases , @xmath116 , and that : ( i ) systems forming tetratic states ( @xmath29 and @xmath99 ) have @xmath117 ; ( ii ) systems not forming tetratic states ( @xmath39 and @xmath101 ) have @xmath118 ; and ( iii ) the critical system @xmath63 has @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 can be regarded as a critical aspect ratio for the formation of tetratic ordering .",
    "this is surprisingly close to the critical value predicted by scaled - particle theory , which gives @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that the strong clustering effects in the vibrated system somehow renormalise the interaction units from rectangles to clusters or superparticles .",
    "since most of the important short - range particle correlations are ` hidden ' inside the superparticles , the remaining weak correlations between superparticles can be renormalised into effective two - particle ( excluded - area ) correlations , well accounted for by standard mean - field theories . a further result that may support",
    "this idea is the behaviour of the cluster order parameters , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , presented in fig .",
    "this behaviour is remarkably similar to the one shown by the order parameters of particles , fig .",
    "the results presented in the previous section point to a scenario for the ordering properties of vibrated rods a bit more complicated than previously reported @xcite . on the one hand , we could not identify a sharp transition point between the disordered isotropic phase and the orientationally order phases at any value of aspect ratio .",
    "rather , orientational order is built up in a continuous fashion as packing fraction is increased , and probably finite size and boundary effects also contribute to the smearing down of the transitions . on the other hand , the oriented configuration of the system is different for aspect ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with the critical value @xmath122 found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which separates tetratic from uniaxial - nematic ordering .",
    "but the nature of our phases is not completely identical . in the first case , @xmath6 , clear tetratic ordering",
    "is observed , as in @xcite .",
    "but in the second , @xmath7 , the system forms large clusters of parallel particles with a random relative orientation , and uniaxial nematic configurations can not be defined , even locally . at large packing fractions",
    "all systems form smectic domains , whose size and life - time increase with packing fraction .",
    "smectic order , which can be understood as arising from packing maximisation , competes with the formation of vortices in the system , and uniform , well - defined steady states apparently do not exist .",
    "the formation of ordered structures in the system may also be viewed in terms of particle clustering .",
    "the tendency of dissipative rods to cluster is much stronger than in thermal equilibrium , and the cluster concept becomes more useful . for low aspect ratio , particles organise into clusters with a close - to - square shape , low shape polydispersity and high rotational mobility .",
    "these factors favour local configurations with tetratic order where neighbouring clusters are oriented at orthogonal directions .",
    "clusters with low aspect ratio form easily , because they involve a small number of rods and consequently recruit low - order particle correlations .",
    "by contrast , for long rods , the system forms compact clusters of large and uneven sizes that are curved and can not arrange into tetratic or uniaxial nematic configurations , but orient randomly .",
    "these large clusters , however , easily form layered , smectic structures at high density .    the fact that vortices seem to affect tetratic and smectic configurations differently is also interesting .",
    "tetratic configurations seem to be very stiff against the excitation of vortices @xcite , since the two mutually orthogonal local directors are inconsistent with a rotational velocity field . therefore , uniform tetratic states , which include point defects that restore the symmetry of the system , may exist for very long times in stable configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "smectic configurations are easily disrupted by vorticity and local shear modes , and uniform , well - defined steady states can not be formed because smectic order is ` entropically ' favoured , but competes with vortex excitations .    financial support from mineco ( spain ) under grants fis2013 - 47350-c5 - 1-r , fis2015 - 66523-p , mtm2012 - 39101 and mtm2015 - 63914-p , and icmat severo ochoa ( spain ) under contract no .",

    "the orientational and positional orders in the cell are quantified by the local and global uniaxial nematic , tetratic and smectic order parameters .",
