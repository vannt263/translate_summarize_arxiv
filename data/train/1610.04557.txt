    "a @xmath5-form @xmath6 on an oriented 7-dimensional manifold @xmath7 is called a @xmath2-structure , if it takes values in a certain open subbundle @xmath8 .",
    "such @xmath5-forms @xmath6 determine ( in a nonlinear way ) a riemannian metric @xmath9 . in the case when the holonomy of @xmath9 lies inside the exceptional lie group @xmath2 , the pair @xmath10 is called a @xmath2-manifold , or equivalently @xmath6 is said to be torsion free .",
    "a @xmath2-instanton is a solution to a gauge theoretical equation that can be written in an oriented @xmath11-dimensional manifold @xmath7 equipped with a @xmath2-structure @xmath6 . even though @xmath2-instantons have entered the mathematical literature for over 30 years now @xcite , it was only in the past few years that the first nontrivial examples appeared , namely in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this recent interest in @xmath2-instantons is mostly due to the suggestion by donaldson - thomas @xcite and donaldson - segal @xcite that it may be possible to use @xmath2-instantons to construct an enumerative invariant of @xmath2-manifolds .",
    "however , adding to the scarcity of examples there are substantial difficulties in constructing such an invariant .",
    "in fact , it is conceivable that in order to overcome some of these difficulties one may need to consider @xmath2-structures that are not torsion free .",
    "indeed , there is a larger class of @xmath2-structures , other than just the torsion free class , with respect to which the @xmath2-instanton equation still lies in an elliptic complex .",
    "all of this leads us to investigate @xmath2-instantons for these more general @xmath2-structures .",
    "for example , one may ask to what extent @xmath2-instantons are persistent under deformations of the @xmath2-structure . in this paper",
    "we classify homogeneous ( invariant ) @xmath2-instantons on an infinite family of @xmath11-manifolds admitting many such @xmath2-structures . as a consequence",
    "we find many examples of new phenomena and are able to investigate what happens to the @xmath2-instantons when the @xmath2-structure varies .",
    "let @xmath12 be a compact , oriented , @xmath11-manifold equipped with a @xmath2-structure @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the induced riemannian metric , @xmath13 the associated hodge star , and @xmath14 the @xmath15-form @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 is a compact , semisimple lie group and @xmath18 is a principal @xmath17 bundle , a connection @xmath19 on @xmath20 is called a @xmath2-instanton if @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the curvature of @xmath19 .",
    "when the @xmath2-structure is coclosed , i.e. @xmath23 , the @xmath2-instanton equation lies in an elliptic complex and we shall restrict to this case . the torsion free @xmath2-structures correspond to the special case when @xmath6 is harmonic .",
    "one other special class of coclosed @xmath2-structures are the so called nearly parallel ones , for which @xmath24 for some @xmath25 . if @xmath6 is nearly parallel , then @xmath9 is einstein with positive scalar curvature .",
    "another perspective on nearly parallel @xmath2-structures is that they are exactly those @xmath2-structures for which the metric cone @xmath26 has holonomy contained in @xmath27 + one other interesting class of connections on a principal bundle over an oriented riemannian manifold are the yang - mills connections .",
    "these are defined as the critical points of the yang - mills energy @xmath28 where we use an @xmath29-invariant inner product to compute the norm @xmath30 .",
    "if the @xmath2-structure is either torsion free or nearly parallel , then @xmath2-instantons are also yang - mills connections . moreover",
    ", in the torsion free case a simple computation ( equation [ eq : action ] ) shows that any @xmath2-instanton actually minimizes the yang - mills energy .",
    "the aloff - wallach space @xmath3 is defined as the quotient of @xmath31 by a @xmath0 subgroup , whose embedding in @xmath31 is determined by two integers @xmath32 .",
    "on each @xmath3 we consider a real 4-dimensional family @xmath33 of @xmath2-structures , which contains exactly two nearly parallel @xmath2-structures .",

    "in fact , for @xmath38 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 , the two nearly parallel @xmath2-structures are in fact strict , meaning that the holonomy of the cone metric @xmath40 on @xmath41 is exactly @xmath42 .",
    "these and other facts regarding the geometry of aloff - wallach spaces are recalled , with more detail , in section [ sec : aloff - wallach ] . in [ ss : invariantconnections ] , we classify invariant connections on each @xmath3 .",
    "these results are then used in section [ sec : awg2instantons ] to investigate @xmath2-instantons on the aloff - wallach spaces @xmath3 , for @xmath38 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 . the remaining case",
    "seperately in section [ sec : x11 ] .",
    "we now summarize the main results of those sections starting with the more general situation . in [ ss : abelian_x_(k , l ) ] we classify invariant abelian @xmath2-instantons with respect to all @xmath43 , see theorem [ thm : abelianinstantons ] . here",
    "we only state a corollary , which is proved in the third item of remark [ rem : abelian_g2_instantons_(k , l ) ]    [ thm : intro_reducible_(k , l ) ] let @xmath38 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 . for the generic @xmath43",

    "then , in section [ ss : non_abelian_x_(k , l ) ] we focus on invariant @xmath2-instantons with gauge group @xmath1 . any homogeneous @xmath1-bundle on @xmath3 can be constructed as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a group homomorphism and the integer @xmath46 denotes the degree of the induced map between maximal tori .",
    "we construct explicit maps @xmath47 , for @xmath48 whose significance is given in theorem [ thm : irreducibleinstantons ] .",

    "x1 - 1 ] we consider a particular example , namely @xmath63 .",
    "as one other application of theorem [ thm : intro_ireducible_(k , l ) ] , we show in [ sss : x1 - 1_g2_instantons ] that @xmath63 admits non - abelian , irreducible @xmath2-instantons for a strictly nearly parallel @xmath2-structure .",
    "these @xmath2-instantons are also yang - mills , as the @xmath2-structure is nearly parallel , but contrary to the torsion free case we show in [ sss : ymx1 - 1 ] that they are not energy minimizing ( not even locally ) .",
    "we refer the reader to figure [ fig : ymfunctional ] for a contour plot of the invariant yang - mills functional .",
    "the results quoted above can be combined into the following    there is a strictly nearly parallel @xmath2-structure @xmath6 on @xmath63 such that :    * for gauge group @xmath1 , there is an irreducible @xmath2-instanton @xmath19 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "* as a yang - mills connection , @xmath19 is not locally energy minimizing .",
    "we now turn to the case when either @xmath64 , or @xmath65 , or @xmath66 which was excluded from the previous results . using the action of the weyl group of @xmath31 , and up to coverings",
    ", we may assume that @xmath67 so we are working on @xmath4 .",
    "this case is analyzed in section [ sec : x11 ] . as already remarked before , on @xmath4 the @xmath2-structures we consider ,",

    "nevertheless , @xmath33 does contain nearly parallel @xmath2-structures , inducing @xmath68 different metrics , one of which is tri - saskian and the other strictly nearly parallel .",
    "there is however , one other homogeneous nearly parallel @xmath2-structure not in @xmath33 , which a sasaki - einstein metric .",

    "the statement is similar to the case @xmath69 in theorem [ thm : intro_reducible_(k , l ) ] . as in that case , the generic @xmath6 admits a unique invariant @xmath2-instanton on any line bundle , however there do exist @xmath43 so that the space of invariant @xmath2-instantons on any complex line bundle is @xmath5-dimensional . in fact , this can be interpreted in light of a more general phenomenon explained in proposition [ prop:3_parameter_family ] . then , in theorem [ thm : irreducibleinstantonsx11 ] we consider @xmath1-bundles over @xmath70 and for all @xmath43 classify irreducible invariant @xmath2-instantons on them .",
    "the statement is however very similar to that of theorem [ thm : intro_ireducible_(k , l ) ] and we shall omit it in this introduction . instead , we state here corollary [ cor : noinstantons ] which a direct application of that result .",
