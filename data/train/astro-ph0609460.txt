    "be stars are non - supergiant , rapid rotators , which at times show emission in the balmer and certain metallic lines .",
    "they are often called `` classical be stars '' to distinguish them from other emission line stars such as herbig ae / be stars and algol systems ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review on be stars ) .",
    "the line emission is assumed to arise in a geometrically thin disk consisting of matter ejected from the central star .",
    "such circumstellar disks have actually been imaged by long - baseline interferometry for several be stars including @xmath1 cmi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . our target star , @xmath1 cmi ( hd 58715 , hr 2845 ) , is a bright but quiet late - type be star ( b8ve ; @xmath5 ) ; no photometric variations were found by @xcite .",
    "the star shows only gradual and small long - term variations in h@xmath6 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) arising from a relatively small disk of @xmath7 stellar radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "other be stars , particularly of early - type , often show short - term photometric variations of less than a few days .",
    "the causes of these variations are assumed to be pulsation and rotational modulation ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "many early - type be stars exhibit line - profile variations indicating the presence of non - radial pulsations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "multi - periodic photometric variations are also the signature of non - radial pulsations such as those found recently by _ most _ for @xmath8 oph ( o9.5ve ; * ? ? ?",

    "until now , there has been no clear indication of pulsations for late - type be stars .",
    "@xcite searched for , but failed to detect any , line - profile variations in b8-b9.5 stars .",
    "there were very small photometric variations in a few late - type be stars , but these were judged to be mono - periodic ( e.g. , @xmath9 pic b9ve , balona et al 1992 ; @xmath8 crv b8vne , barrera et al . 1991 ) and attributed to rotational modulation .",
    "it is of critical importance to know if nonradial pulsations are excited even in late - type be stars because it would indicate that all be stars may have nonradial pulsations which could play a critical role in mass ejection .",
    "excitation of g - modes in late - type be stars is likely because the cool boundary of the distribution of be stars on the hr diagram @xcite roughly coincides with the cool boundary of the slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars @xcite , and because prograde g - modes can be excited even in a rapidly rotating star @xcite . with this motivation we observed @xmath1 cmi with _",

    "starlight from primary science targets ( @xmath10 ) is projected onto the science ccd as a fixed ( fabry ) image of the telescope pupil covering about 1500 pixels for high photometric stability and insensitivity to detector flatfield irregularities and the effect of particle irradiation on individual pixels .",
    "the experiment was designed to detect photometric variations with periods of minutes at micro - magnitude precision and does not rely on comparison stars or flat - fielding for the fabry photometry .",
    "there is no direct connection to any photometric system .",
    "tracking jitter was dramatically reduced by early 2004 to @xmath111 arcsec which led to significantly higher precision in the fabry photometry .",

    "outlying data points generated by poor tracking or cosmic ray hits were removed .",

    "data are also recorded for fabry images from seven of the eight lenses adjacent to the target fabry lens in order to track the stray light background .",
    "these background signals were combined in a mean and subtracted from the target photometry .",

    "the reductions basically followed the scheme outlined earlier by @xcite .",

    "observing time was split between @xmath1 cmi and another field such that only 45% of each 101 min orbit was available for @xmath1 cmi .",
    "in addition to the 45% duty cycle over the 41 days , there was a single @xmath1112 hour gap .",
    "individual exposures were 8 sec taken every 20 sec ( the sampling time ) . for the final frequency analysis",
    "mean magnitudes were calculated from data accumulated every 5 min .",

    "frequencies with amplitudes @xmath13 mmag ( 3.5 times the noise level averaged over the spectrum from 0 to 15 cycles  day@xmath14 ) are identified in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "the plot includes the spectral window function and shows the residual amplitude spectrum after removal of the 20 highest peaks .",

    "the peak at 15.2 cycles  day@xmath14 is an artifact related to _ most _ s orbital frequency .",
    "there are two dominant features in the dft , with frequencies of @xmath15 cycles  day@xmath14 ( s / n @xmath11 8.5 ) and @xmath16 cycles  day@xmath14 ( s / n @xmath11 3.5 ) .",
    "the spacing between these two frequencies is @xmath17 cycles  day@xmath14 .",

    "however , given their relatively low signal - to - noise , we do not consider these to be definitive detections in this data set .",
    "there is also evidence for significant stellar variability at frequencies below 3 cycles  day@xmath14 but its origin is unclear .",
    "we have performed the frequency analysis on the data , both with the long - term trends removed and left in the time series .",
    "the frequency identifications reported above are unaffected , which is consistent with the very clean spectral window of the most photometry and the expected lack of power leakage from low to higher frequencies in the fourier spectrum of these data .",
    "error bars for the fit parameters are determined by a bootstrap process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". a large number of trial light curves ( 10000 in this case ) are generated by randomly sampling the @xmath12 light curve .",
    "the fitting procedure is repeated for each new light curve resulting in a distribution for each fit parameter .",
    "the error bars are 1 standard deviation in each of the parameter distributions ( see for example saio et al 2006 ) . note that these frequencies are well determined although the amplitudes of the main peaks have moderate uncertainties .",
    "to understand the cause of the periodic variations detected by _ most _ we have performed a pulsational stability analysis for rapidly rotating main - sequence star models of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , whose evolutionary tracks pass close to the position of @xmath1 cmi ( fig.[hrd ] ) .",

    "the excited modes in our @xmath49 , non - rotating models , are high - order g - modes excited by the fe - opacity bump @xcite .",

    "nonradial pulsations of a rapidly - rotating star can not be represented by a single spherical harmonic and coupled with toroidal velocity fields . in our analysis the angular dependence of pulsation amplitude is expanded using eight spherical harmonics @xmath50 for a given azimuthal order @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for toroidal velocity field ) , where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) for even modes and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) for odd modes with @xmath57 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for general discussions on nonradial pulsations of rotating stars ) .",

    ", we find that the cooler boundary of instability is bluer than in the non - rotating case .",
    "fewer modes are excited in more rapidly rotating models .",
    "this implies rapid rotation tends to stabilize g - mode pulsations .",
    "the pulsation frequency in the observers frame is given as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pulsation frequency in the frame co - rotating at frequency @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , pulsation frequencies in the observer s frame for high - order g - modes and r - modes ( for which @xmath65 ) tend to group depending on the @xmath51 value just as seen in figure  [ nute3p5 ] .",
    "all the excited prograde modes ( @xmath66 ) seen in figure  [ nute3p5 ] are sectoral ( @xmath67 ) g - modes , while all the excited retrograde ( @xmath68 ) modes are r - modes ( in which toroidal motion is dominant ) in those rapidly rotating models .",
    "no retrograde g - modes are excited in this figure .",
    "we note that , as shown in appendix a , the stability of pulsation modes differs considerably if we use the so - called traditional approximation in which the horizontal component of the angular velocity of rotation is neglected .    under the assumption of @xmath69 mhz ( 1.73 cycles  day@xmath14 ) , the periodic light variations of @xmath1 cmi are approximately reproduced by r - modes of @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed variations are identified as sectoral prograde g - modes of @xmath71 if we assume @xmath72 mhz ( 2.59 cycles  day@xmath14 ) . in the former case",
    "another three groups of frequencies are expected to be observed in the estimated @xmath73 range of @xmath1 cmi , while in the latter case only one group of frequencies should be observed ( fig.[nute3p5 ] ) . since _ most",
    "_ has detected only one group of frequencies around 3.26 cycles  day@xmath14 in @xmath1 cmi (  [ most ] ) , we conclude that a model rotating at @xmath72 mhz ( 2.59 cycles  day@xmath14 ) is more appropriate . in fig.[spectrum ] were assigned to g - modes of @xmath74 and the main frequencies around 3.26 cycles  day@xmath14 to r - modes of @xmath75 .",
    "we consider this highly unlikely , however , since r - modes are not expected to yield luminosity variations much larger than the sectoral g - modes of @xmath74 , and because no peaks around 4 cycles  day@xmath14 corresponding to g - modes of @xmath76 are detected . ] for this rotation rate pulsations excited at @xmath77 are prograde sectoral high - radial order ( 19th33rd ) g - modes . the frequencies in the co - rotating frame range over @xmath78 .",
    "frequency spacings between two adjacent modes lie in a range from @xmath79  cycles day@xmath14 to @xmath80  cycles day@xmath14 .",
    "since the frequency resolution expected from the data is approximately @xmath81 cycles  day@xmath14 , only a few frequencies are expected to be resolved just as the dft indicates ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ nute3p5 ] show the rotation angular frequency @xmath82 normalized by the keplerian frequency @xmath83 . for a given @xmath64 , @xmath82 increases as the model evolves because the stellar radius @xmath84 increases .",
    "since the equatorial radius is larger than the mean radius , the rotation velocity becomes critical at the equator with @xmath85 ; probably at @xmath86 .",
    "figure  [ nute3p5 ] indicates that @xmath49 models with @xmath87 mhz rotate nearly critically at the effective temperature of @xmath1 cmi .",
    "( for @xmath21 models with @xmath87 mhz , @xmath88 , not appropriate for @xmath1 cmi . ) this supports townsend et al s ( 2004 ) claim that classical be stars may be rotating much closer to their critical velocities than is generally supposed .",
    "it is also consistent with the recent statistical property found by @xcite that the coolest be stars rotate nearly critically .",
    "we have found nonradial g - mode pulsations excited in the late - type be star @xmath1 cmi ( b8ve ) .",
    "this confirms that @xmath1 cmi belongs to the new class of spbe stars , like hd163868 @xcite .",
    "we have identified pulsation modes as prograde - sectoral g - modes of @xmath3 , based on the comparison between the observed frequencies and theoretical ones excited by the fe bump of opacity in rapidly rotating models .",
    "the fact that only one group of frequencies is detected by _ most _ is consistent with our prediction of the pulsational stability if @xmath1 cmi rotates nearly critically .",
    "this supports the recent claims @xcite that classical be stars rotate more rapidly than previously thought ( 7080% of the critical rate ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed amplitudes are small ( @xmath89 mmag ) .",
    "since @xmath1 cmi lies close to the red edge of the instability region on the hr diagram , the pulsational instability is not strong and hence the pulsation amplitudes are expected to be small .",
    "our discovery of nonradial pulsations in @xmath1 cmi suggests the possibility that nonradial pulsations are involved in all rapidly rotating be stars . in some",
    "early - type be stars mass ejections are observed to occur at certain pulsation phases ( e.g. @xmath9 cen : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that pulsations trigger mass ejections .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that nonradial pulsations may play a crucial role in mass ejection in all be stars .",
    "@xcite argued that prograde nonradial pulsations can transport angular momentum toward the surface and spin up the equatorial region critically leading to a mass ejection .",
    "@xcite showed numerically that introducing velocity variations corresponding to a prograde ( @xmath90 ) nonradial pulsation in a nearly critically rotating stellar atmosphere actually yields a circumstellar keplerian disk .    our findings in this paper and @xcite ,",
    "that _ prograde _ sectoral g - modes are selectively excited in rapidly rotating be stars , support the above scenario for mass ejection .",
    "line - profile - variation ( lpv ) analyses for early type be stars , however , tend to indicate the presence of retrograde modes @xcite rather than prograde modes , contrary to our model findings .",
    "@xcite obtained four periods around 0.503 days and two period around 0.28 days from lpvs in @xmath9 cen , one of the best studied and most active be stars .",
    "[ these lpvs of @xmath9 cen were modeled as retrograde ( @xmath91 ) modes by @xcite . ]",
    "frequency spacings among each group are about 0.034 cycles  day@xmath14 or less , which are comparable with the frequency difference 0.025 cycles  day@xmath14 between the two main frequencies of @xmath1 cmi (  2 ) and with typical frequency spacings @xmath92 cycles  day@xmath14 of hd 163868 @xcite .",
    "these frequency spacings are comparable with those of g - modes , although they are close to the limit of the frequency resolution .",
    "longer observations by most or corot would make g - mode seismology of spbe stars possible .",
    "also , simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations of @xmath9 cen and other be stars showing conspicuous lpvs and mass - ejection events would be important to understand the connection between nonradial pulsations and mass ejections in be stars .",

    "the pulsation analysis for low - frequency modes of a rapidly rotating star is greatly simplified by the use of the so - called traditional approximation , in which the horizontal component of the angular velocity of rotation ( @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the co - latitude ) is neglected . under the traditional approximation",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath96 deviates from @xmath95 as the ratio of the rotation to the pulsation frequency ( in the co - rotating frame ) increases depending on @xmath51 and @xmath58 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the traditional approximation is justified dynamically for low - frequency pulsations , but it is not clear whether the approximation is reasonable for the nonadiabatic stability analysis . to see the effect ,",
    "we have performed a stability analysis using the traditional approximation for @xmath20-@xmath97 models rotating at a frequency of 0.03 mhz .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ trad_nute ] . comparing this figure with figure  [ nute3p5 ]",
    ", we see that under the traditional approximation , larger numbers of prograde sectoral g - modes are excited , and that tesseral g - modes of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are also excited .",
    "these tesseral modes are all damped without the traditional approximation in these models .",
    "the cause of the difference is attributed to damping due to mode - couplings @xcite which are absent under the traditional approximation .",
