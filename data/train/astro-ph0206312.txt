    "before the launch of _ chandra _ the study of diffuse x - ray emission from normal ( non - starburst ) spiral galaxies was seriously impeded by lack of spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "the point sources could not be well separated from the diffuse thermal gas .",
    "the detection of diffuse emission from the disk of spiral galaxies was therefore only possible for some nearby objects ( e.g.  m  33 : @xcite ; m  101 : @xcite ; m  51 : @xcite ) .",
    "coronal ( halo ) emission was observed in some nearby edge - on spiral galaxies like ngc  891 @xcite and ngc  4631 @xcite .",
    "also the diffuse component of the hot thermal plasma in the milky way has been studied extensively ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here we present _ chandra _ observations of the spiral galaxy ngc  2403 that made it possible to unambiguously separate discrete sources from diffuse emission .",
    "this galaxy is a nearby sc spiral , morphologically similar to m  33 , viewed at an inclination angle of @xmath5  60@xmath6 .",
    "it is well isolated on the sky and shows no signs of recent interactions .",
    "h  i observations @xcite have revealed a kinematically anomalous component of neutral gas .",
    "the h  i position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram along the major axis of this galaxy ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) shows systematic asymmetries in the form of wings in the line profiles at lower velocities with respect to the rotation curve ( white squares ) . in the central part of the galaxy such wings extend up to 150 km s@xmath3 from the rotation curve .",
    "this kinematical pattern is different from that expected for a thin cold disk of h  i ( see the model in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this anomalous gas was previously unknown .",
    "it has not been detected before , mainly because of lack of sensitivity of the observations .",
    "a detailed analysis of the h  i data of ngc  2403 has shown that the wings of h  i are produced by gas ( the `` anomalous gas '' ) located above the plane of the galaxy and rotating @xmath5",
    "20@xmath050 km  s@xmath3 more slowly than the gas in the disk .",
    "a similar slower rotation of the `` halo '' gas had already been observed in the edge - on galaxy ngc  891 @xcite .",
    "the anomalous gas in ngc  2403 extends out to @xmath5 15 kpc from the centre of the galaxy and has a total mass of about 3 @xmath1 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ( @xmath5  1/10 of the total h  i mass ) .",
    "the study of its velocity field has also revealed a probable large - scale radial inflow ( 10@xmath020 km  s@xmath3 ) towards the centre of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation is that of a _ galactic fountain _ @xcite and the observed neutral gas may be the result of cooling of ionised gas blown up from the disk into the halo .",
    "the discovery of hot x - ray emitting gas from the disk of ngc  2403 , reported here , supports this picture .",
    "the anomalous h  i may be related to the hot x - ray gas .",
    "ngc  2403 was observed with _",
    "chandra _ in april 2001 for a total time of 36  ks .",
    "the galaxy was centred on the acis - s3 ccd with an y - offset of about 1@xmath9 from the nominal pointing of the chip to better fit in the @xmath5  8@xmath108@xmath9 field . the s3 chip ( back illuminated )",
    "was chosen because of the higher sensitivity in the soft x - ray band . the on - axis",
    "_ spatial resolution is @xmath5 1@xmath11 corresponding to 15 pc at ngc  2403 ( we adopted the distance of 3.18 mpc from @xcite ) .",
    "the orientation of the telescope was chosen in such a way that the diagonal of the chip was parallel to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the data were reduced and analyzed with the packages ciao ( version 2.1 ) and xspec ( version 11.0.1 ) .",
    "we removed high background time by excluding events exceeding @xmath12  3  @xmath13 the mean chip count rate .",
    "the resulting exposure time of the observation was 34.9 ks .",
    "the energy range was restricted to 0.4@xmath010 kev .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the optical ( dss ) and @xmath14 images of ngc  2403 . in the soft ( 0.4@xmath01 kev )",
    "x - ray image ( upper right panel ) an adaptive smoothing was applied to the original data after the background subtraction .",
    "the background was subtracted using deep blank - field datasets with the same focal plane temperature as ngc  2403 observations ( @xmath0120  @xmath6c ) .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fig2 ] show two 5@xmath11 smoothed s3 images in the soft ( left , 0.4@xmath01 kev ) and hard ( right , 1@xmath010 kev ) bands without background subtraction .",
    "these images show numerous discrete x - ray sources located in the bright part of the stellar disk of ngc  2403 .",
    "the adaptively smoothed image also shows the presence of diffuse emission in the soft x - ray band .",
    "discrete x - ray sources were detected in ngc  2403 using ciao _",
    "wavdetect _ on the full resolution s3 image .",
    "we used a threshold of 10@xmath15 ( 4.7 @xmath13 level , or less than 0.25 false detections per chip ) .",
    "we looked for sources of different sizes , from 1@xmath11 to 16@xmath11 , to detect both point and extended sources and in different energy bands to detect both soft and hard sources .",
    "a total of 41 sources were found in the field of the s3 ccd . assuming a standard ( kt @xmath5 5 kev ) spectrum",
    ", the faintest source has an x - ray flux of @xmath16  10@xmath17erg @xmath18 s@xmath3 or a luminosity of @xmath16  10@xmath19 erg s@xmath3 at the distance of ngc  2403 .",
    "some of these sources are probably background sources unrelated to ngc 2403 . on the basis of the rosat log(@xmath20)@xmath0log(@xmath21 )",
    "@xcite , at the above flux limit and considering the shadowing by the galaxy ( with a typical h  i column density of 0.5@xmath01 @xmath1 10@xmath22 @xmath18 ) , we estimate about 5@xmath010 background sources in our s3 chip .",
    "the majority of the detected sources are unresolved and show emission in the hard band .",
    "those for which a spectral analysis was possible show binary - type spectra .",
    "three sources are extremely bright with observed fluxes ( 0.4@xmath010 kev ) of 4.3 @xmath1 10@xmath23 , 6.2 @xmath1 10@xmath23 , and 1.1 @xmath1 10@xmath24 erg  s@xmath3  @xmath18 . if they belong to the galaxy their luminosities are 5.2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 , 7.1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 , and 1.3 @xmath1 10@xmath25 erg  s@xmath3 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these sources have luminosities and spectra typical of the class of the ultra luminous x - ray sources found in several nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "most of the x - ray sources of ngc  2403 are inside the stellar disk , tracing the spiral pattern of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests a relation with the stellar population i as found for other late - type spiral galaxies ( e.g.  m  33 , @xcite ) .",
    "three sources coincide with bright h  ii regions and are clearly resolved in the _ chandra _ images ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "point sources ( except the 3 h  ii regions ) were removed from the full resolution _",
    "chandra _ data of ngc  2403 by masking elliptical areas around each source .",
    "each elliptical area found by _ wavdetect _",
    "( 3 @xmath13 of the psf ) was visually inspected in order to enlarge , if necessary , the masking area .",
    "pixels inside the ellipses were filled by local background values ( poisson method in @xmath26 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ( left ) shows the exposure - corrected x - ray _ chandra _ image in the soft band ( 0.4@xmath01 kev ) after the subtraction of the point sources ( h  ii regions excluded ) and smoothed to a resolution of 15@xmath11 . the contribution to the diffuse emission from sources under the detection limit can be estimated from the luminosity function .",
    "we obtained the luminosity function from the log(@xmath20)@xmath0log(@xmath21 ) calculated for the 38 point sources and assuming a standard spectrum for x - ray binary with @xmath27 = 1.6 @xcite .",
    "the best power - law fit for luminosities above 2 @xmath1 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath3 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of the sources above a given luminosity limit and @xmath30 is the luminosity in units of 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath3 . from this function",
    "we estimate the contribution of sources under the detection limit to be lower than about 5% .",
    "therefore the x - ray emission in figure  [ fig3 ] is most likely produced by truly hot interstellar gas .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows , for comparison , an h@xmath31 line image of ngc  2403 taken from the archive of the cfh telescope .",
    "the distributions of h@xmath32 and x - ray emission are very similar and the main features agree in position very well .",
    "the hot gas seems to follow the spiral structure suggesting that most of this emission comes from the disk of ngc  2403 and is related to the star formation ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the emission from the halo , that is expected to be uniform , is not dominant here .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission was extracted with the software packages _ calcrmf _ and _ calcarf _ provided by a. vikhlinin . the response matrices were determined from the fits embedded function response file fp@xmath0120 for the operating temperature of @xmath0120  @xmath6c . the spectrum was obtained from an elliptical region of diameter 8@xmath9 with the same position angle ( p.a.=124@xmath6 ) as the disk of ngc  2403 . in order to perform a spectral analysis a careful estimate of the background is needed .",
    "we extracted two background spectra : the first was extracted from the same elliptical region as that of the galaxy on the blank field data ; the second was obtained from an elliptical region ( about 4@xmath9 diameter ) in the upper left corner of our s3 chip .",
    "the two backgrounds are similar in the soft ( 0.4@xmath01 kev ) band ( 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath33 and 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath33 cts s@xmath3 pix@xmath3 for the first and the second respectively ) while above 1 kev the background of our s3 field is higher ( by a factor 2 ) than the one of the blank field .",
    "this difference is not caused by background variations within the chip .",
    "we tested this by extracting backgrounds from different regions across the blank field chip and finding no significant variations .",
    "the contamination of our s3 background by the galaxy is also excluded because the differences show up in the spectral region ( 1@xmath02 kev ) in which the galactic emission is much weaker . besides",
    ", we also extracted a third background from an elliptical region on the s1 chip ( back illuminated ) and found it very similar to the s3 one .",
    "therefore there is probably a slighly intrinsic difference between the background during our observations and that on the blank field above 1 kev .",
    "this could be caused by a local anisotropy in the pointing direction or by a different instrumental noise . in the following spectral analysis we preferred to use the background obtained from our s3 chip .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the spectrum of the x - ray emission of ngc  2403 after the subtraction of point sources in the band 0.4@xmath02 kev .",
    "a fit with a mekal thermal plasma model @xcite with one component gives a temperature of kt @xmath34 0.25@xmath120.1 kev ( t @xmath34 2.9 @xmath1",
    "10@xmath35 k ) with a @xmath36=1.72 .",
    "better one - component fits ( @xmath37 1.5 ) are obtained with a 0.1 solar abundance or an under - abundance of alpha elements ( o , mg , si , ca ) of about 0.3 solar .",
    "a significantly better fit ( @xmath38 1 ) , solid line in figure  [ fig4 ] , is obtained with two components at temperatures kt@xmath39 0.18@xmath120.03 kev ( t @xmath34 2.1 @xmath1 10@xmath35 k ) and kt@xmath40 0.73@xmath120.07 kev ( t @xmath34 8.4 @xmath1 10@xmath35 k ) and absorption column density fixed to the galactic value of 4.1 @xmath1 10@xmath41 @xmath18 .",
    "given the poor statistics , the metal abundances are substantially unconstrained giving acceptable results for values from 0.1 to 1 solar ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in the fit in figure  [ fig4 ] the abundances are fixed to 0.3 solar .",
    "the `` emission line '' at about 1.8 kev is due to a known strong instrumental background feature , not completely subtracted .",
    "the total observed flux of the diffuse emission ( 0.4@xmath02 kev ) is 1.77 @xmath1 10@xmath23 erg @xmath18 s@xmath3 ( total luminosity of 2.14 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this value corresponds to about 3% of the total x - ray luminosity from ngc  2403 and is similar to that of 1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 found with rosat for m  33 @xcite .",
    "the total de - absorbed luminosity is l@xmath42=2.66 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the relative contributions of the soft and hard components to the total luminosity are about equal ( l@xmath43/l@xmath44 1 corresponding to a ratio of the counts rates of cts@xmath43/cts@xmath451.4 ) .",
    "we have detected diffuse soft x - ray emission from the disk of the spiral galaxy ngc  2403 .",
    "the x - ray emission is strongly associated with the h  ii regions and is most likely produced by hot gas from stellar winds and expanding supernova shells within the disk of the galaxy .",
    "if we assume a rate of supernova explosions of 0.01 events yr@xmath3 for ngc  2403 @xcite and a mean energy release per supernova of 10@xmath46 erg we estimate that the total amount of energy released by supernovae is @xmath5  3 @xmath1 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this is much larger than the observed x - ray luminosity ( 2.1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "thus the hot ism of ngc  2403 can be easily produced by energy input from star formation activity and a heating efficiency as low as 0.001 .",
    "one interesting question is whether the hot gas in ngc  2403 is actually bound to the galaxy or not .",
    "the escape velocity from a galaxy is usually calculated as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the potential at radius @xmath50 .",
    "assuming a mass model ( disk @xmath51 isothermal dark matter halo ) for ngc  2403 @xcite we get an escape velocity of 300@xmath0350 km s@xmath3 in the central 4 kpc .",
    "the thermal velocity of the hot gas is likely to be between the adiabatic sound speed @xmath52 and the post - shock speed @xmath53 .",
    "if we take the temperature of the one - component mekal fit kt @xmath34 0.25 kev ( t @xmath34 2.9 @xmath1",
    "10@xmath35 k ) we obtain a thermal velocity for the hot gas ( n@xmath54/n@xmath55=0.1 ) of 170@xmath0300 km s@xmath3 , lower than the escape velocity .",
    "similar values have been found for other galaxies ( e.g. ngc  4631 , @xcite and the milky way , @xcite ) .",
    "the above estimate shows that at least part of the x - ray emitting gas found in ngc  2403 is likely to be bound to the galaxy .",
    "one implication of this result is that this hot gas does not substantially contribute to the enrichment of the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "furthermore , if this gas can temporarily escape from the disk into the halo region it will necessarily fall down onto the disk .",
    "according to a `` galactic fountain '' type of process the hot gas escaping from the disk is expected to cool quickly because of adiabatic expansion and in the final phase it could become observable as neutral gas at anomalous velocities .",
    "the anomalous h  i shown in the p - v diagram of figure  [ fig1 ] is likely to represent such a final phase of the galactic fountain , whereas the hot x - ray emitting gas would pertain to the initial phase of it .    from the above x - ray luminosity and temperature we estimate an electron density and a mass of the hot gas of 0.15 @xmath1 10@xmath56 @xmath57 cm@xmath56 and 6.0 @xmath1 10@xmath59 @xmath8 where @xmath60 is",
    "the scaleheight of the disk in kpc and @xmath61 is the filling factor",
    ". the cooling rate of the hot gas can be estimated with the formula @xcite @xmath62 that for @xmath63 gives @xmath64 @xmath8 yr@xmath3 . if we consider now the mass of the anomalous h  i , a typical size of 10 kpc and the measured infall velocity of 10@xmath020 km s@xmath3 , we estimate the infalling rate of h  i to be @xmath65 @xmath8 yr@xmath3 larger than the cooling rate of the hot gas .",
    "however such value for cooling rate is probably representative only for the disk component and would vary substantially once the gas has left the disk itself .",
    "a more useful quantity is the outflowing rate of the hot gas . considering the mass and the thermal velocity determined above , and assuming a continous cycle beetwen hot and neutral gas , such escaping rate turns out to be @xmath66 0.1@xmath00.2 @xmath8 yr@xmath3 , of the same order as the infalling h  i. therefore it is possible that cooling of the x - ray emitting gas in ngc  2403 and its motion via a galactic fountain could produce the observed h  i position - velocity pattern .",
    "is has been suggested that the anomalous h  i is common among spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hot x - ray emitting gas is probably present in several spiral galaxies with a high rate of star formation .",
    "one can argue , therefore , that the hot gas and the anomalous h  i are , generally , connected as in ngc  2403 .",
    "finally this discovery of diffuse x - ray emitting gas in ngc  2403 has also interesting implications for the study of our galaxy .",
    "the anomalous h  i in ngc  2403 is analogous to at least some of the high velocity clouds @xcite of our galaxy .",
    "the suggested relation between the neutral and the hot gas in ngc  2403 supports the possibility that galactic fountains play an important role also in the milky way .",
