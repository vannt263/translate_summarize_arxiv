    "porosity and dimension are two useful but different concepts for quantifying the degree of singularity of fractal sets and measures ; thus it is a natural problem to understand the relationship between them .",
    "this problem has received considerable attention over the last two decades , and continues to be an active area of research .",
    "estimates for dimension in terms of porosity were obtained for a wide variety of notions of porosity ( and dimension ) @xcite , and the porosity ( in an appropriate sense ) of many natural sets and measures was investigated @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the relationship between porosity and other geometric concepts such as conical densities and singular integrals was explored @xcite .",
    "this article is a contribution to this line of research .",
    "our results yield a strong quantitative form of a theorem that was stated in @xcite , but with an incorrect proof .",

    "koskela and rohde also show that , other than for the value of the constant , this estimate is asymptotically sharp as @xmath20 .    in this article",
    ", we use probabilistic and dynamical ideas to obtain an analogue of the above result for measures rather than sets . the notion of porosity",
    "was extended to measures by eckman , jrvenp and jrvenp in @xcite , and mean porosity of measures was introduced by beliaev and smirnov in @xcite .",

    "we will informally say that @xmath0 is * weakly mean porous * if it is mean @xmath33-porous for some @xmath38 .",
    "from a geometric perspective , mean porous measures are perhaps more natural ; at the very least , letting @xmath39 results in cleaner statements and proofs . on the other hand ,",
    "as pointed out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) , many measures of dynamical and analytical origin are weakly porous , but not porous ( or mean porous ) . in this article",
    "we obtain bounds on the packing dimension of weakly mean porous and , by extension , also of mean porous and weakly porous measures .",
    "we first state our main result in the mean porous case , and discuss its significance .",
    "afterward we state our more general result concerning weakly mean porous measures .",
    "the following is our main theorem regarding the dimension of mean porous measures :    [ thm : main - result ] suppose @xmath0 is a mean @xmath14-porous borel probability measure on @xmath21",
    ". then @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the packing dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "( see  [ subsec : dimension ] for its definition . )",
    "we make some remarks regarding this statement .",
    "other than for the value of the constant @xmath19 , the estimate given in the above theorem is sharp . in other words , there exists a constant @xmath43 such that for any @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] one can construct a measure @xmath0 which is mean @xmath14-porous and satisfies @xmath46 ( here @xmath47 denotes the hausdorff dimension of a measure ; see  [ subsec : dimension ] . )",
    "this will be clear from the proof of the theorem .",
    "alternatively , one can modify the example in @xcite which shows that is sharp in the case of sets .    for porous measures ,",
    "a similar result was obtained independently by kenmki , rajala and suomala ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.6 ) .",
    "their proof works in regular metric spaces , under some assumptions on the measure , but does not extend to mean porosity .",
    "for @xmath36 close to @xmath48 ( which is the maximum possible value , see ( * ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) , a much better bound for the packing dimension of mean porous measures was obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , for small @xmath36 and any @xmath49 , it was not even known whether a mean @xmath14-porous measure always has dimension strictly smaller than the dimension of the ambient space .",
    "theorem [ thm : main - result ] is stated in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) ( for a slightly larger class of mean porous measures ; see  [ subsec : other - notions ] ) . however , as pointed out in @xcite , the proof given in @xcite is not correct .",
    "the problem lies in the claim that mean porous measures can be approximated by mean porous sets ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) ) ; in @xcite it is shown that this is not the case : there are mean porous measures that assign zero mass to all mean porous sets .",
    "therefore , it does not seem possible to prove theorem [ thm : main - result ] by reducing it to the results of koskela and rohde @xcite for sets .    on the other hand , the estimate for mean porous sets does follow from our results .",
    "this can be seen from the following two facts :    * any borel set of packing dimension @xmath36 supports a borel probability measure of packing dimension at least @xmath50 for any @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) , * if the support of a measure @xmath0 is mean @xmath14-porous , then so is the measure @xmath0 .",
    "this is obvious from the definitions .      for many natural fractal measures , such as measures arising from hyperbolic dynamical systems ,",
    "mean porosity is too strong of a condition .",
    "however , such measures are often mean @xmath33-porous for a suitable small , but positive , @xmath26 .",
    "see the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) .",
    "the next theorem shows that if @xmath26 is smaller than some explicit multiple of @xmath52 , then the packing dimension of any mean @xmath33-porous measure is strictly smaller than the ambient dimension @xmath53 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath26 , we recover the bound in theorem [ thm : main - result ] .",
    "[ thm : main - result - general ] fix an ambient dimension @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "note that theorem [ thm : main - result ] is an immediate corollary of parts and in theorem [ thm : main - result - general ] .",
    "even though theorem [ thm : main - result - general ] is a deterministic geometric result , our proof uses ideas from probability and dynamics .",
    "a first step is to convert the problem into a dyadic version which is more amenable to analysis .",
    "this is standard in geometric measure theory ; here we obtain the dyadic analogue by means of a random translation ( purely geometric arguments are often more complicated ) .",
    "the key idea of the proof is to use trees and martingales to express the local dimension of a measure @xmath0 in terms of averages of entropies and lyapunov exponents ( suitably defined ) as one zooms in towards a @xmath0-typical point .",
    "this idea was introduced ( in a different context ) in @xcite to study the dimension of projected measures .",
    "a crucial difference with @xcite is that here we need to consider dyadic partitions consisting of cubes of many different sizes ( see section [ sec : notation ] ) .",
    "while dealing with uniform partitions is enough to show that the packing dimension of mean porous measures is strictly smaller than the dimension of the ambient space , in order to get the sharp asymptotics more general dyadic trees appear to be needed .",
    "this semi - local approach has two crucial advantages .",
    "firstly , porosity at a given scale results in an entropy drop at that scale , so that there is a natural link between porosity and dimension ( via entropy averages ) . secondly ,",
    "since we average over all scales , this method is naturally suited to handle mean porosity , rather than just porosity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : notation ] we introduce our general setting and review some concepts of dimension of a measure .",
    "section [ sec : martingales ] describes a general method to estimate dimension which will be key in our later proofs . in section [ sec : dyadic - porosity ]",
    "we define dyadic analogues of mean porosity , state theorem [ thm : main - result - dyadic ] , which is an explicit dyadic version of our estimates , and deduce theorem [ thm : main - result - general ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main - result - dyadic ] is given in section [ sec : proof - of - theorem ] .",
    "we conclude with examples , generalizations and open questions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we fix an ambient dimension @xmath53 for the rest of the article .",
    "by a cube we always mean a half - open cube in @xmath21 with sides parallel to the axes . the side length of a cube @xmath66 will be denoted @xmath67 .",
    "our main objects of interest will be trees of cubes formed by repeated subdivision .",

    "the simplest such trees are the ones generated by subdivision into @xmath77-adic cubes for some @xmath78 , but we will need the more general construction .    abusing notation , we will also denote the set of vertices of the tree by @xmath75 . the collection of cubes at tree distance @xmath2 from the root @xmath74 will be denoted @xmath79 .",
