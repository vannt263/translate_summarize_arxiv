    "at present a large set of experimental data is available on light and heavy mesons which is constantly extending @xcite .",
    "recently , the most dramatic progress has been achieved in the heavy meson sector . as a result , in the last years many new charmonium states and new bottomonium states have been discovered @xcite .",
    "the number of the open - flavour ( charmed @xmath3 and bottom @xmath4 ) meson states is also constantly increasing .",
    "some of the new states are the long - awaited ones , expected within the constituent quark model many years ago , while some others , with masses higher than the thresholds of the open charm and bottom production , have narrow widths and unexpected decay properties @xcite .",
    "similar exotic states are known in the light meson sector .",
    "there are theoretical indications @xcite that some of these states could be the first manifestation of the existence of exotic hadrons ( tetraquarks , molecules , hybrids etc . ) , which are predicted to exist within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in order to explore such entities ,",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the meson spectroscopy and decays up to rather high orbital and radial excitations is required .",
    "thus , one of the important issues is the study of strong meson decays .",
    "such decays are the main channels for mesons with masses above open flavour production thresholds .",
    "they are investigated already for many years .",
    "nevertheless , strong decays still constitute a rather poorly understood area of hadronic physics in view of their complex nonperturbative dynamics , which has not yet been deduced directly from qcd .",
    "several phenomenological models of open - flavour strong decays have been proposed and described in the literature . some of them are based on effective chiral meson lagrangians derived from the nambu - jona - lasinio quark model ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , which express decay amplitudes through quark loop integrals with quark propagators between initial and final meson vertices .",
    "however , such considerations of strong decays do not account for quark confinement and momentum - dependence of vertices .",
    "in particular , vertices are considered to be point - like and , as a result , quark loop integrals diverge .",
    "thus , the introduction of some phenomenological cutoff parameter is necessary .",
    "the other group of approaches are based on different types of quark pair creation models .",
    "they differ in the production mechanism of a light quark pair from the qcd vacuum . the phenomenological @xmath0 model @xcite considers the corresponding quark - antiquark pair to be produced in the vector state",
    ". however , this appears to disagree with experiment and is thus ruled out @xcite .",
    "the most popular approach to strong meson decays is based on the phenomenological @xmath5 model ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this model assumes that the quark - antiquark pair is created with the vacuum quantum numbers , @xmath6 .",
    "it gives for most decays results in fairly good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the important features of the model are its simplicity and necessity to introduce only one additional parameter , the strength of the decay interaction , in order to describe various strong decays . this parameter is considered as a free constant and is fitted to the data .",
    "it is generally believed that the pair production strength parameter is roughly flavour independent , but recent studies , involving a global fit of the experimental data , indicate that it can be scale dependent @xcite",
    ". however , this model does not clarify the fundamental mechanism of pair creation .",
    "it has an explicitly nonrelativistic character with meson wave functions modeled by simple gaussian functions .",
    "all this makes it very difficult to improve the model .",
    "another approach , closely related to the @xmath5 model , is the flux - tube breaking model @xcite .",
    "it also assumes that a quark - antiquark pair is created with the vacuum quantum numbers , but it additionally includes the overlaps of the flux - tube of the initial meson with those of the two final mesons .",
    "therefore , the resulting calculations are more complicated , but lead to predictions close to the results of the @xmath5 model .    in the microscopic decay model @xcite , which is more closely related to qcd",
    ", the pair creation originates from the current - current interactions due to the potential binding quarks in mesons , which is usually assumed to be the sum of the scalar confining interaction and the one gluon exchange .",
    "it generalizes the above approaches , which can be obtained as its special limiting cases .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 model results are reproduced with the constant scalar interaction .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath5 model , the strong decay rates are completely determined by the meson wave functions , quark masses and interaction parameters . at present ,",
    "most calculations are done in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model with spherical harmonic oscillator wave functions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a model of strong decays has been proposed , where the pair creation occurs due to the string breaking .",
    "the basic interaction in this model is the scalar colour - singlet confining potential acting between the light quark and heavy antiquark .",
    "it is flavour independent and nonlocal for the zero mass light quark pair , turning to the linearly rising confining potential for a long breaking string .",
    "there is a direct correspondence between the string breaking model and the microscopic decay model with the scalar potential , but the former uses a relativistic formalism for light quarks with vanishing current masses .    in this paper we propose a relativistic approach for the calculation of strong decays of mesons in the framework of the previously developed relativistic quark model @xcite based on the quasipotential approach .",
    "for this purpose , the microscopic decay model is extended to include relativistic effects into decay matrix elements , relativistic corrections and boosts of the meson wave functions .",
    "the qcd - motivated quark - antiquark interaction potential , which was previously found to reproduce well mass spectra and electroweak decays of mesons , is used for the description of the pair creation mechanism .",
    "the resulting relativistic calculations are rather complicated .",
    "as a first step , we consider the simplest case , where only @xmath7-wave mesons are involved .",
    "this significantly simplifies the angular structure of decay matrix elements .",
    "the comparison of the obtained results with the available experimental data for the decays of vector ( @xmath0 ) mesons to a pair of pseudoscalar ( @xmath1 ) mesons provides a test of our approach .",
    "for the following calculations we use the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "mesons are considered as the bound states of constituent quarks which are described by the single - time wave functions satisfying the three - dimensional relativistically invariant schrdinger - like equation with the qcd - motivated interquark potential @xcite @xmath8 with the relativistic reduced mass defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the meson mass , @xmath11 are the quark masses , and @xmath12 is the relative momentum of the constituent quarks . in the center of mass system",
    "the relative momentum squared on the mass shell @xmath13 is expressed through the meson and quark masses : @xmath14[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4m^2}.\\ ] ] it is assumed that the kernel of this equation  the interquark quasipotential @xmath15  consists of the perturbative one - gluon exchange ( oge ) and the nonperturbative confining parts @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath20 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the dirac matrices and spinors , respectively .",
    "the confining part is taken as the mixture of the lorentz - scalar and lorentz - vector linearly rising interactions which in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath24 with @xmath25 therefore , in this limit the cornell - type potential is reproduced @xmath26 the value of the mixing coefficient @xmath27 has been obtained from the consideration of the heavy quark expansion for the semileptonic @xmath28 decays @xcite and charmonium radiative decays @xcite .",
    "for the qcd coupling constant @xmath29 we set the scale @xmath30 and use the model with freezing @xcite @xmath31 where the background mass is @xmath32  gev , and @xmath33  mev was fixed in our model from fitting light and heavy - light meson spectra @xcite .",
    "the vector vertex of the confining interaction contains the additional pauli term with the nonperturbative anomalous chromomagnetic moment of the quark @xmath34 @xmath35 we fixed the value @xmath36 by analyzing the fine splittings of heavy quarkonia @xmath37- states @xcite and the heavy quark expansion for semileptonic decays of heavy mesons @xcite and baryons @xcite .",
    "it enables the vanishing of the spin - dependent chromomagnetic interaction , proportional to @xmath38 , in accord with the flux tube model .",
    "the constituent quark masses @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 gev and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath43 gev@xmath44 and @xmath45 gev were determined from the previous analysis of meson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "note that we have used a universal set of model parameters for the calculations of the meson , baryon and tetraquark spectra as well as their weak and radiative decays .    in the following section we apply our relativistic quark model to the consideration of the strong decays of vector mesons to a pair of pseudoscalar mesons .",
