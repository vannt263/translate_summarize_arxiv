    "all spectra have been rebinned to at least 20 counts for energy channel , in order to ensure the applicability of @xmath46 test in the spectral fits .    exploiting the spectral capability we were able to obtain the simultaneous broad band spectrum ( 0.1200  kev ) of gs  1843 + 00 .",

    "pulse period variations observed in the 30 days monitoring obtained by combining data from _ batse _ , _ rxte  pca _ and , confirmed the presence of a high intrinsic spin  up rate .",
    "moreover , assuming a be transient system having an orbital period between 50 and 60 days , inferred from the pulse ",

    "the source spectrum , which is well described by an absorbed power law with high energy cut ",

    "the very high absorption , @xmath64 is consistent with that reported by koyama et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis that the absorption is mainly interstellar rather then circumstellar ( @xcite ) is supported by the marginal detection of a fluorescent k@xmath59 iron line in the source spectrum .",
    "it is unclear if cyclotron resonance scattering features are present in the hard x  ray spectrum of the source .",
    "koyama et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that the cut  off in the spectrum observed at @xmath1318   kev could be related to a very intense magnetic field typical of this class of source .",
    "moreover , mihara ( @xcite ) , fitting the phase resolved spectrum with an absorption  like feature at @xmath1320  kev , classified 1 as a possible cyclotron source .",
    "although the spectrum is observed with good statistics up to @xmath13100  kev , no evidence of any cyclotron feature is observed in the pulse phase averaged spectrum of 1 . also the `` crab  ratio technique''(@xcite ) , successfully exploited in detecting resonance cyclotron features ( rcfs ) in other x  ray pulsars , does not display any sign of cyclotron features . moreover no evidence of cyclotron absorption features was found in the phase resolved spectra below 100 kev .",
    "however , we found an upper limit on the depth of 0.15 for the possible 20 kev feature .",
    "this value is compatible with that found by mihara ( @xcite ) .",
    "manchanda ( @xcite ) , using data from the lase experiment , a balloon  born large area scintillation counter , recently suggested the possibility of an absorption feature around 100 kev or an emission at 140 kev .",
    "unfortunately , statistics of spectra is quite low at that energy and a much deeper analysis , which is underway , is required .",
    "there are @xmath1380 known accreting x  ray pulsars ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . until recently only the relatively bright nearby pulsars were visible due to the limited sensitivity of previous detectors .",
    "this is changing with the discovery by _ asca _ , _ rosat _ , and _ rxte _ of a population of faint , absorbed pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the search for faint pulsars is one of the main scientific objectives of the _ asca _ galactic plane survey ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
