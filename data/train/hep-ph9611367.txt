    "the single top quark production processes are of great importance at hadron colliders since they allow a direct measurement of the coupling of the @xmath2-boson to the top quark _",
    "i.e. _ the ckm matrix element @xmath4 .",
    "these processes can also be used to search for anomalous couplings of the top quark . with a mass in the neighborhood of 175 gev@xcite ,",
    "the top quark is by far the heaviest of the known quarks . as a consequence",
    ", the electroweak decay of the top quark proceeds so rapidly that toponium bound states and @xmath5 mesons do not have time to form  @xcite and the decay products of the top quark are correlated with its spin  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if a top quark is produced with a significant spin correlation , this correlation will be translated into large angular correlations in such events .",
    "studies of these angular correlations in single top production can then be used as sensitive searchs for anomalous couplings of the top quark , _",
    "i.e. _  physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "traditionally in high energy physics processes , the discussions of spin - related observables take place in terms of the helicities of the fermions involved .",
    "however this description is most useful when the fermions are produced in the ultra - relativistic limit because in this limit the chirality eigenstates are identical to the helicity eigenstates . for fermions which are not ultra - relativistic , such as the top",
    "quark produced at the tevatron , one must deal with the fact that the chirality and helicity of a massive fermion may not be specified simultaneously .",
    "therefore , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the helicity basis will give the best description of the spin of top quarks at the tevatron .",
    "in fact , it has recently been shown that the helicity basis does not lead to the largest values for various spin - related correlations in @xmath6 production at either the tevatron@xcite or an @xmath7 collider@xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask : is there a better spin basis than helicity for the description of the spin correlations in _ single _ top production ?",
    "the answer to this question is yes : we will construct such a spin basis in this paper .",
    "we will concentrate on two important production mechanisms for single top quarks at the tevatron .",
    "both of these mechanisms produce the single top quark in a left handed chirality state through a virtual @xmath2 boson .",
    "therefore , significant spin correlations are expected even at the tevatron , where the top quark is produced well below the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "the first of these ( fig .",
    "[ wstardiagram ] ) is the purely electroweak @xmath3 channel  @xcite u |d t|b , [ wstarprocess ] while the second ( fig .",
    "[ wgfusiondiagram ] ) consists of the so - called @xmath2-gluon fusion ( @xmath8 fusion ) processes  @xcite u g & & t |b d ; |d g & & t |b |u .",
    "[ wgfusionprocess ] the feasiblity of isolating single top quark production in a collider environment has been already been demonstrated for both the @xmath3 channel  @xcite and the @xmath2-gluon fusion process  @xcite .",
    "early on it was recognized by willenbrock and dicus  @xcite that the @xmath8 fusion process is dominated by the configuration where the @xmath9 quark is nearly collinear with the incoming gluon , leading to a logarithmic factor @xmath10 in the total cross section . in the event that this factor is too large as a suitable measure , where @xmath11 is the strong coupling constant , the top quark mass @xmath12 , and the bottom quark mass @xmath13 . ]",
    "the perturbative calculation of the @xmath14 process becomes unreliable , and one should instead compute @xmath15 , with the large logarithm being absorbed into the @xmath16 parton distribution function .",
    "this latter approach has been employed by bordes _",
    "@xcite in their effort to accurately compute the total cross section , including higher - order corrections . among their conclusions is the statement that to lowest order , for top quark masses up to a few hundred gev , the two pictures give comparable event descriptions and lead to similar cross sections  @xcite .",
    "this statement is also true for the top quark spin correlation .",
    "therefore , we will frame our discussion of @xmath8 fusion in terms of the tree level description involving only the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ wgfusiondiagram ] .    in sections ii and iii",
    "we discuss in detail the top quark spin correlations in single top quark production via the @xmath3 process and @xmath8 fusion process , respectively .",
    "finally we end with a discussion and conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we give an example in detail of how the top spin correlations lead to angular correlations in events .",
    "the example given is single top production in the @xmath1 channel . throughout this paper",
    "we will only consider processes which produce a top quark in the final state .",
    "the treatment of the charge - conjugated processes , where a top antiquark is produced , is similar .",
    "we begin with the simpler of the two production mechanisms for single top quarks at the tevatron , the electroweak process @xmath17 , which proceeds via a virtual @xmath2 boson ( see fig .",
    "[ wstardiagram ] ) .",
    "we represent the momentum of the each particle by its symbol , and write the amplitude in crossing symmetric form with all momenta outgoing .",
    "our results are easily derived using the spinor helicity method for massive fermions described in  @xcite to treat the top spin . in particular , we decompose the top quark momentum into a sum of two massless auxiliary momenta , t_1 ( t + m_ts ) ; t_2 ( t - m_ts ) , where @xmath18 is the usual spin vector of the top quark . in the rest frame of the top quark ,",
    "the spin of the top quark is in the same direction as the spatial part of @xmath19 .",
    "then , the matrix element squared for the production of a spin up top quark summed over color and all of the other spins is ( 0|u d t_|b)^2 = g_w^4 n_c^2 [ wstargenup ] while for a spin down top quark we have ( 0|u d t_|b)^2 = g_w^4 n_c^2 , [ wstargendn ] where @xmath20 is the weak coupling constant , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass and width of the @xmath2 boson , @xmath23 is the number of colors , and @xmath24 is the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa matrix element . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the standard model with three generations and suppress the ckm factor @xmath25 .",
    "the sum of  ( [ wstargenup ] ) and  ( [ wstargendn ] ) is obviously independent of the choice of the spin axis of the top quark , as is required .",
    "it is clear that the top quarks produced via the @xmath1 process are 100% polarized along the direction of the @xmath0-type quark , since  ( [ wstargendn ] ) vanishes if we choose @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the ideal basis for studying the @xmath27 spin is the one which uses the direction of the @xmath0-type quark as the spin axis .",
    "( see the appendix for a discussion of this process keeping track of all of the correlations between production and decay . ) of course , in an actual experiment , we know only that one of the two initial state partons is a @xmath28 .",
    "however , the largest contribution to the total cross section comes from the case where the @xmath28 is donated by the antiproton .",
    "in fact , for the tevatron at 2  tev , we estimate that 98% of the cross section may be attributed to this configuration ( see table  [ wstarpartons ] ) .",
    "this suggests that an excellent choice would be to decompose the top spin along the direction of the antiproton beam , independent of the actual identity of the parton supplied by that beam .",
    "we will refer to this choice as the `` antiproton '' basis .",
    "to aid in the comparison of the antiproton basis to the more traditional helicity decomposition , we present the matrix elements as a function of the angle @xmath29 between the direction of the top quark in the zero momentum frame ( zmf ) of the initial parton pair and the @xmath30 axis , and the speed @xmath31 of the top quark in the zmf .",
    "we orient our coordinate system such that the protons travel in the positive @xmath32 direction ; the antiprotons travel in the negative @xmath32 direction . because eqs .",
    "( [ wstargenup ] ) and  ( [ wstargendn ] ) are not symmetric under the interchange of @xmath33 and @xmath0 , the expressions we obtain in terms of these variables will depend upon which beam the @xmath28 quark comes from . in the following equations , the parton taken from the proton will always be written first , followed by the parton taken from the antiproton .",
    "we now turn to the actual matrix elements for the antiproton basis , where spin up means that in the rest frame of the top quark , its spin points in the same direction as the incoming antiproton beam is traveling in that frame . for the 98% of the time that the @xmath28 comes from the antiproton , we have ( u|dt_|b)^2 = g_w^4 n_c^2 ( 1+)(1 + ) , [ wstarpbarup ] where ^2 + ^2 and @xmath34 .",
    "the spin down amplitude vanishes in this case . on the other hand , when the @xmath28 is supplied by the proton instead",
    ", we obtain ( |dut_|b)^2 = g_w^4 n_c^2 [ wstarpbarpu ] for spin up , and ( |dut_|b)^2 = g_w^4 n_c^2 [ wstarpbarnd ] for spin down .",
    "thus , the presence of a @xmath28 sea in the proton introduces a small quantity of spin down top quarks into the sample .",
    "indeed , this contribution is dominated by the spin down component .",
    "however , the smallness of this contribution still results in a sample in which the top spin is aligned with the antiproton direction in the top quark rest frame 98% of the time .",
    "we now compare these results to the helicity basis , using the zmf as the frame in which we measure the helicity .",
    "we begin with the case where the @xmath28 quark comes from the antiproton , for which the matrix element squared is ( u|dt_|b)^2 = 12 ( 1-)(1-^2 ) [ wstarhelup ] for the production of spin up ( right - handed helicity ) top quarks and ( u|dt_|b)^2 = 12 ( 1+)(1+)^2 [ wstarheldn ] for the production of spin down top quarks .",
    "the expressions for the @xmath35 intial state may be obtained by making the replacement @xmath36 .",
    "the spin up amplitude is proportional to @xmath37 , causing it to vanish in the ultra - relativistic limit . at more moderate values of @xmath31 , such as are dominant at the tevatron ,",
    "both spins are produced , with spin down ( left - handed helicity ) top quarks predominating .",
    "we find that in the over - all mixture at the tevatron , 83% of the top quarks have left - handed helicity .",
    "table  [ wstarpurities ] summarizes the purities for the helicity , antiproton , and for completeness , proton bases .",
    "the proton basis is defined by choosing @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _  the parton donated by the proton beam . ) and  ( [ wstarpbarnd ] ) apply to the @xmath39 initial state once the replacement @xmath40 is made .",
    "likewise , eq .  ( [ wstarpbarup ] ) represents the lone non - vanishing contribution from the @xmath35 initial state after making the same replacement .",
    "] also included are the values of the spin asymmetries [ asym ] for each basis , as this is the coefficient which determines the magnitudes of the angular correlations .",
    "thus , the improvement from 83% left - handed helicity to 98% spin up in the antiproton basis translates into a factor of 1.45 increase in the size of the correlations .",
    "we plot the differential distributions in top quark @xmath41 for the helicity and antiproton bases as well as the total in fig .",
    "[ wstarplot ] .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for single 175 gev top quarks at the tevatron is the so - called @xmath8 fusion process .",
    "we consider the processes  ( [ wgfusionprocess ] ) and hence the gauge - invariant set of diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ wgfusiondiagram ] .",
    "once again we use the symbol for each particle to represent its momentum . for convenience ,",
    "we employ the explicitly crossing - symmetric form in which all momenta are outgoing . because @xmath8 fusion is a @xmath42 process , the polarized production matrix elements squared for an arbitrary spin axis are too complicated to reproduce here@xcite .",
    "however , the sum over all spins and colors may be simply written as momentum is timelike , one should add the standard width term to the @xmath2 propagator . ] ( 0|udgt|b)^2 = g_w^4g_s^2n_c(n_c^2 - 1 ) ( u , d;t , b ) + z(d , u;b , t ) , where ( u , d;t , b ) = ( 2 dt ) \\ { tu - u(b+g ) } .",
    "we present the relative contributions to the cross section from each of the partonic initial states for this process in table  [ wgfusionpartons ] .",
    "as expected from the observation that the proton contains two @xmath33 quarks while the antiproton contains only one @xmath28 quark , the @xmath43 initial state gives the largest contribution ( 74% ) to the total . in terms of the helicity basis ( defined in the zero momentum frame of the incoming partons ) , we find that approximately 83% of the top quarks have negative helicity ( see table  [ wgfusionpurities ] ) , leaving significant room for improvement .    to illuminate our improved basis , we present the matrix element squared for the production of spin down top quarks in the basis where the spin axis is chosen to coincide with the @xmath0 quark direction : ( 0|udgt_|b)^2 = g_w^4 g_s^2 n_c(n_c^2 - 1 ) . besides being surprisingly simple , this result is significant in that it comes exclusively from the lower diagram in fig .",
    "[ wgfusiondiagram ] ; hence , there are no inverse powers of @xmath44 from the @xmath16-quark propagator . as is well - known  @xcite , in the limit of vanishing @xmath16-quark mass , the @xmath8 fusion process develops a collinear singularity . for the physical ( non - zero ) value of the @xmath16 mass ,",
    "this is reflected in the tendency for the @xmath16 quark to be produced at large pseudorapidity .",
    "thus , the majority of the total rate comes from the regions of phase space where @xmath44 is small : hence the spin down component ( no pole in @xmath44 ) is suppressed relative to the spin up component .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath43 and @xmath45 partonic initial states , we find that 97% of the tops are produced with spin up in this basis .    since for the @xmath43 and @xmath45 initial states",
    "the @xmath0 quark becomes the spectator jet , we define the `` spectator '' basis by electing to use the direction of the spectator jet ( defined as the light jet appearing in the @xmath46 final state ) for the spin axis . although this picks the wrong spin axis direction for the @xmath47 and @xmath48 initial states , it is correct the majority of the time .",
    "we find that the overall composition consists of 96% spin up top quarks in this basis . for comparison ,",
    "we give the results for the proton and antiproton bases in table  [ wgfusionpurities ] . in terms of the spin asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) , we see that the spectator basis represents a factor of 1.36 improvement over the helicity basis . the differential distributions in top quark @xmath41 for the helicity and antiproton bases as well as",
    "the total appear in fig .",
    "[ wgfusionplot ] .",
    "in this paper we have found that the direction of the @xmath0-type quark provides the most effective spin axis for all single top production mechanisms . however",
    ", experimentally we do not know with certainty which physical object comprises the @xmath0-type quark in a given event .",
    "we have chosen the object which is most likely to be the @xmath0-type quark . in the case of the @xmath3 production mechanism , this means the direction of the antiproton beam , since it supplies the @xmath28 quark 98% of the time at the tevatron . using the antiproton as our basis , we find that the top quark is 98% spin up . as a result , the angular correlations with this choice of spin axis are 45% larger than those using the helicity basis .    for @xmath8 fusion ,",
    "the situation is potentially more complicated .",
    "nearly three - quarters of the cross section comes from the situation where the proton donates a @xmath33 quark : hence the @xmath0 quark appears as the spectator jet in the final state . in double - tagged events , identifying this jet is trivial ; in other cases , it may be necessary to assume that the jet with the largest pseudorapidity is the spectator jet .",
    "although a full simulation is beyond the scope of this paper , it is clear that this identification can be achieved with a small error rate because of the unique kinematics of this process . using the spectator jet as our basis , we find that the top quark is 95% spin up and that the angular correlations are 36% larger than the correlations using the helicity basis .",
    "we have demonstrated that the helicity basis is _ not _ the optimal basis for the discussion of angular correlations in single top quark production at the tevatron .",
    "instead , we have shown that the direction of the @xmath0-type quark provides a superior spin axis for _ all _  single top production mechanisms .",
