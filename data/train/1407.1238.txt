    "reflection component accounts well for all three features noted above , namely the soft excess , broad fe k residuals , and hard x  ray excess .",
    "the description of the data improves by adding a rather typical warm absorber ( we use the model in ) affecting both the power law and the disc  reflection component .",
    "as the column density of the warm absorber is consistent with being the same in the two observations , we force a common @xmath84 in both data sets .",
    "we obtain a significant improvement to @xmath85 for 2577 dof with a common column density of @xmath86  @xmath3 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) for the _ suzaku _ ( xmm  2 ) observation .",
    "although the fit is now acceptable , the xmm  2 data are not well reproduced with systematic positive residuals in the 26  kev band .",
    "moreover , the resulting spectral shape for that observation is still rather flat ( @xmath89 ) when compared with the typical value for unobscured agn ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we then consider the possible presence of absorption by including a neutral absorber affecting both the power law and disc  reflection components .",
    "for the sake of generality , we allow it to partially cover the x  ray source .",

    "in fact , the _ suzaku _ spectrum is consistent with being unabsorbed ( with covering fraction @xmath93 ) .",

    "we measure a black hole spin of @xmath0 at the 99.99 per cent confidence level , and of @xmath101 at the 90 per cent one .",
    "hence , the accreting black hole powering eso  362g18 is a very rapidly spinning kerr black hole , consistent with being maximally spinning ( @xmath102 ) . the contours plot for the disc",

    "all three parameters are consistent with those derived from the simpler analysis discussed above and performed with emission line models only ( see fig .",
    "[ hqfe ] and the associated discussion ) .",
    "however , using the broadband data and more self  consistent and physically  motivated models significantly reduces the uncertainties on these relevant parameters .",
    "having found a good global spectral model for the two highest  quality observations of our campaign , we now use it to perform a simultaneous analysis of the first four x  ray observations of table  [ obslog ] , namely to the _ swift _ , xmm  1 , _ suzaku _ , and xmm  2 observations .",
    "we defer the analysis of the five _ chandra _ monitoring observations to section  [ chandra ] .",
    "the x  ray spectrum of eso  362g18 from the first four observations is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ hq4 ] together with the best  fitting models ( see below ) .",
    "remarkable spectral variability is present with a general steeper  when  brighter behavior .",
    "moreover the ( lowest flux ) xmm  1 observation appears to have a distinct spectral shape .",
    "the visually larger narrow fe line equivalent width suggests that the hard x  ray continuum is significantly depressed during the xmm  1 observation , either because of an intrinsic low flux state or because of absorption .",
    "we proceed by performing a joint fit to the four observations with the same model discussed above .",
    "the warm absorber ionization is unconstrained during the _ swift _ and xmm  1 observations .",
    "we then fix this parameter to that obtained during the higher quality xmm  2 observation which ( according to our best  fitting model , see below ) has a similar intrinsic luminosity .",
    "we force the warm absorber column density to be the same in all observations , as in the analysis of the high  quality _ suzaku _ and xmm  2 observations .",
    "the joint fit is excellent with @xmath105 for 2933 dof .",
    "the most remarkable result is that the lowest  flux xmm  1 observation appears to be heavily absorbed by neutral gas with a column density of @xmath106  @xmath3 covering about 80 per cent of the x  ray source . removing the absorber from the xmm  1 model , i.e. attempting to explain the xmm  1 spectral shape with no intrinsic absorption ( beside the warm absorber ) , yields to a disc  reflection dominated model but results in a poorer statistical description ( @xmath107 for 2936 dof ) .",
    "moreover , the photon index is too flat to be realistic ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we conclude that the spectral shape during the xmm  1 observation is driven by cold absorption rather than by an extremely low intrinsic flux .",
    "some residuals are seen at @xmath109  kev during the lowest flux xmm  1 observation . adding a further soft ( unresolved ) x  ray emission line at @xmath110  kev ( corresponding to ne  ix ly ) yields @xmath111 for 1 more free parameter ( although it was not detected in our analysis , the line intensity is consistent with the rgs spectrum of the xmm  2 observation , and it is included with the same intensity of @xmath112  ph  s@xmath49  @xmath3 in all observations , as is the case for all other unresolved soft x  ray emission lines , see table  [ rgs ] ) . the soft x ",
    "ray emission lines we include in our model are most likely associated with emission from extended gas that is photo",
    " ionized by the agn .",
    "the same gas may also be associated with a soft scattered component , as ubiquitously seen in the x  ray spectra of heavily absorbed agn ( e.g. bianchi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we test this scenario by adding to our model a soft power law that is only absorbed by the galactic column density .",
    "its normalization is the same in all spectra , as this component is not expected to vary . the fit does not improve ( @xmath113 for 2 more free parameters ) .",
    "we measure a a photon index @xmath114 and a scattered 0.52  kev luminosity of @xmath115  erg  s@xmath49 .",
    "this component is overwhelmed by the x  ray continuum , and thus negligible , in all observations except the lowest  flux xmm  1 observation .",
    "for consistency with the typical soft x  ray spectrum of heavily obscured agn , we keep this component in our best  fitting spectral model although , as mentioned ,",
    "it is not formally required by the data .",
    "we conclude that most of the spectral variability seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ hq4 ] is due to a variable cold absorber changing in both column density and covering fraction , although photon index variability is also detected with @xmath116 .",
    "the most important absorption variability event is detected during the xmm  1 observation which requires a much higher level of neutral x  ray absorption than any other observation and , in particular , than the _ swift _ observation which was performed only 63 days earlier .",
    "we measure a column density of @xmath117  @xmath3 covering @xmath118 per cent of the x  ray emitting regions during the xmm  1 observation .",
    "such a column density is more than one order of magnitude higher than during any other observation .      as discussed extensively by miniutti et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the inclusion of a hard scattered component describes very well the absorbed x ",
    "ray states of another source which exhibits extreme x  ray absorption variability , namely eso  323-g77 .",
    "a hard scattered component is likely present in all cases where absorption is due to a clumpy rather than homogeneous structure .",
    "this is because our line  of  sight ( los ) is absorbed by a specific clump ( cloud ) , but the x  ray continuum in different directions intercepts different clumps which re  direct part of it into our los via scattering .",
    "the presence of a hard scattered component has also been reported in other absorbed agn such as ngc  3227 ( lamer , uttley & mchardy 2003 ) and ngc  7582 ( piconcelli et al .",
    "both sources exhibit variable x  ray absorption , most likely associated with clumpy absorbers , in line with the scattering interpretation outlined above .",
    "the x  ray absorption variability eso  362g18 strongly suggests that this is the case here as well .    in order to check for the presence of a hard scattered component in eso  362g18",
    ", we use the same phenomenological model used by miniutti et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the case of eso  323g77 .",
    "we include an additional absorbed power law with the same ( observation  dependent ) photon index and normalization as the intrinsic nuclear continuum , we allow the column density towards this component to be different than that affecting the nuclear continuum ( but the same in all observations ) , and we multiply the model by a constant allowed to vary between 0 and 1 which represents the hard scattering fraction .",
    "the statistical description of the data improves significantly by @xmath119 for 2 more free parameters for a final result of @xmath120 for 2928 dof .",
    "the hard scattered component is absorbed by a column density of @xmath121  @xmath3 , and its scattering fraction is @xmath122 per cent .",
    "note that this component is significantly detected only during the most heavily absorbed xmm  1 observation ( as expected , see the discussion in miniutti et al .",
    "the inclusion of that component induces a higher column density and covering fraction during the xmm  1 observation , while not affecting any other parameter .",
    "we now measure a column density of @xmath123  @xmath3 , consistent with a full coverage of the x  ray emitting region with covering fraction @xmath124 during the xmm  1 observation .",
    "note that , as our phenomenological description of the hard scattered component is likely only a rough approximation of the true spectral shape , these values are likely affected by larger uncertainties than the quoted statistical ones .    re  running the error contours on the relativistic parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ relparams ] ) gives identical results .",
    "this is expected since the relativistic parameters are best constrained from the highest - quality x ",

    "we fix the parameters associated with the soft x ",
    "ray emission lines , the distant reflection component , and the soft and hard scattered components to the values derived from the analysis discussed above , as the _ chandra _ data have typically lower spectral quality , and because these components are not expected to vary .",

    "as before , we force the warm absorber column density to be the same in all observations , while the ionization parameter is free to vary independently . as for the neutral partial covering absorber ,",
    "the column density is initially free to vary independently .",
    "however , as @xmath84 turns out to be consistent with being the same in all _ chandra _ observations , we force it to have the same value in all data sets , so that the cold absorber is only allowed to vary in covering fraction .",

[ lag ] ,",

    "we can not exclude that absorption variability contaminates our lag measurement , although the inspection of hardness ratios between different energy bands during the xmm2 observation , implies that spectral variability is confined within 510  % , i.e. absorption variability is only modest on short timescales .",

    "a clumpy absorber may be directly identified with the clumpy obscuring torus ( e.g. nenkova et al .",
    "2008a ; rivers et al .",
    "2011 ; miniutti et al . 2014 ; markowitz , krumpe & nikutta 2014 ) .",

    "although the blr and clumpy torus are likely part of the same obscuring structure ( elitzur & shlosman 2006 ) , they can be physically distinguished by their dust content .",
    "the blr is dust  free , which locates the blr within the dust  sublimation radius .",
    "the same radius is instead generally considered as representative of the inner edge of the clumpy torus . to gain some insight on the location and origin of the variable absorber , we consider uv data of eso  362g18 with the goal of distinguishing between dust  free and dust  rich absorption during the xmm  1 observation .",
    "if the @xmath243  @xmath3 absorber affecting the xmm  1 observation is associated with the dusty clumpy torus , the uv emission from eso  362g18 may also be affected , provided that the absorber covers a sufficiently high fraction of the uv  emitting region ( likely the accretion disc ) . on the other hand , if the absorber is dust  free ( e.g. the blr clouds ) , no significant effect is expected in the uv .",
    "reliable optical and uv fluxes can be obtained from the uvot and om telescopes on board _ swift _ and _ xmm  newton _ during the mildly absorbed ( hereafter _ `` unabsorbed '' _ for simplicity ) _ swift _ and xmm  2 observations as well as during the absorbed xmm  1 one .",

    "it is worth pointing out that the uv intrinsic variability is an unlikely explanation for the observed variability in the uvm2 and uvw2 filters because the intrinsic x  ray luminosity is higher during the x  ray absorbed xmm  1 observation than during the two x  ray unabsorbed ones .",
    "the most natural interpretation of the observed uv variability is then that the uv  emission at the shorter wavelength uvm2 and uvw2 filters is affected by absorption ( as are the x ",
    "rays ) during the xmm  1 observation , while it is not during the two x  ray unabsorbed ones . by comparing the uv flux during absorbed / unabsorbed observations , and assuming that total coverage would completely block the uv emission , we infer that the absorber covers @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) per cent of the uv  emitting region in the uvm2 ( uvw2 ) filter . in summary ,",
    "the uv data are consistent with a dusty absorber covering about 30 - 40 per cent of the uv emitting region during the x  ray absorbed xmm  1 observation .",
