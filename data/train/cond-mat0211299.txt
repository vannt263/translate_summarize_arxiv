    "ring exchange interactions are often present in strongly correlated many - particle systems . in the hubbard model of electrons with on - site repulsive interaction @xmath5 , the large @xmath5 limit leads to an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath6 between electrons at nearby sites where @xmath2 is the hopping amplitude of electrons .",
    "it was shown that the next leading order term in the effective hamiltonian is the four - particle ring exchange interaction with the strength @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the multi - particle ring exchange interactions have been studied extensively in solid @xmath8he @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that the ring exchange interactions may play an important role in understanding the ` metal - insulator ' transition in low density two - dimensional electron systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , ring exchange models have been revisited in the context of the occurrence of novel quantum ground states in strongly correlated electrons , bosons , and spin systems @xcite .",
    "in particular the possibility of fractionalized phases where the elementary excitations carry fractions of quantum numbers of electrons / spins has been discussed @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that in some soft - core boson models with ring exchange interactions , there may exist a novel phase which is neither a superfluid nor a conventional insulator ; the low energy excitations in this phase are described by a continuous set of wavevectors with zero energy , which may be called a bose ` surface ' in analogy to the familiar fermi surface of electrons @xcite . on the other hand , a quantum monte carlo study of a quantum xy model with a ring exchange interaction ( which may correspond to a hard core version of the boson model with a similar ring exchange considered in ref.@xcite ) did not find this novel phase , but found that new emerging ground state is a striped bond - plaquette ordered state at intermediate values of the ratio between the four - spin ring exchange and the nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange couplings @xcite .",
    "independent of these developments , there have been great interest in finding novel broken symmetry phases in correlated electron systems .",
    "notable examples are the proposals of various time - reversal symmetry broken phases for the explanation of the pseudogap phase of underdoped cuprates.@xcite one of these examples involve short - ranged ( fluctuating ) @xcite or long - ranged @xcite orbital antiferromagnetic order ; the long - range ordered state is often called the staggered flux phase @xcite or the d - density wave state @xcite .",
    "this is a metallic state and characterized by alternating circulating currents in plaquettes of the square lattice while the charge density is uniform . whether the short - range or the long - range ordered orbital antiferromagnetism is responsible for the pseudogap in cuprates has been a subject of recent debates @xcite .",
    "mean field theory studies of some microscopic models have shown that the orbital antiferromagnetic state appears in some part of the phase diagram @xcite .",

    "previous neutron scattering experiments on an undoped cuprate la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 suggests that the presence of ring exchange is necessary to explain the spin wave spectra@xcite , while the effect of ring exchange interaction may become weaker at finite concentration of mobile holes . in this paper , we investigate the effect of ring exchange process in a two - dimensional correlated electron system .",
    "in particular we would like to understand the effect of ring exchange process on the orbital antiferromagnetic state .",
    "a good starting point would be the large @xmath0 limit of the @xmath1 generalization of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model where the orbital antiferromagnetic state is already present as a possible ground state .",

    "the stability of different phases in the large @xmath0 limit will be reflected in those situations as well .    in this paper , we study the effect of the four - particle ring exchange interaction in the @xmath1 generalization of the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 model in the large @xmath0 limit . here",

    "we are mostly interested in the effect of the four - particle exchange couplings on the orbital antiferromagnetic state ( staggered flux phase ) that exists in some parts of the large parameter space of the model .",
    "it is found that it is useful to first consider two extreme limits ; the square lattice limit ( all the parameters describing the processes between the next - nearest - neighbor sites are zero ) and the limit of inter - penetrating square lattice ( all the parameters describing the processes between the nearest - neighbor sites are zero ) .",
    "this is mainly because , even in the ring exchange limit @xmath129 , the staggered flux phase exists as a stable ground states near these two limits ; some small nonzero next - nearest - neighbor ( nearest - neighbor ) hopping and heisenberg exchange couplings about the square lattice limit ( the inter - penetrating square lattice limit ) .",
    "we studied these two extreme cases as well as the conventional ring exchange limit at half - filling and a finite hole concentration .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows . in the half - filled case ( @xmath133 ) ,",
    "fig.6 shows the comparison of saddle - point energies of various phases in the square lattice limit . in this case , the staggered flux phase is never a ground state and either the fully dimerized phase or the box phase is the ground state .",
    "one can see from fig.6 that the difference between the saddle - point energies of the staggered flux phase and the ground state ( dimerized / box phase ) becomes larger for large @xmath134 and/or @xmath135 . at a finite hole concentration ( @xmath136 ) , the phase diagrams in the square lattice and the inter - penetrating square lattice limits are given by fig.10 and fig.15 .",
    "note that the finite hopping amplitudes can stabilize the staggered flux phase that has circulating orbital currents ( orbital antiferromagnetic state ) while the extremely large hopping amplitude eventually leads to the uniform phase .",
    "it is clear from these phase diagrams that the four - particle exchange processes favor the dimerized ( these are ` partially ' dimerized ) phases or the inhomogeneous orbital antiferromagnetic state ( box phase ) over the homogeneous orbital antiferromagnetic state ( staggered flux phase ) .",
    "this trend persists even in the conventional ring exchange limit @xmath129 as can be seen from fig.16 and fig.17 .",
    "thus we conclude that the ring exchange or the four - particle exchange in general suppresses the staggered flux phase ( homogeneous orbital antiferromagnetism ) , and instead favors the dimerized phases and/or the inhomogeneous orbital antiferromagnetic state depending on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "we note that a recent quantum monte carlo study @xcite of a quantum xy model with a ring exchange process discovered a striped bond - plaquette ordered state at intermediate values of the ratio between the four - spin ring exchange and the nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange couplings .",
    "these results seem to be qualitatively consistent with our findings in the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 model studied here even though there are obvious differences in two models",
    ". the existence of more exotic phases @xcite like fractionalized phases in different parameter regimes of the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 model would be an interesting subject of future study .",
