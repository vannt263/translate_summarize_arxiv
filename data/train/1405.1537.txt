    "<S> we report on the observation of a large anisotropy in the rethermalization dynamics of an ultracold dipolar fermi gas driven out of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> our system consists of an ultracold sample of strongly magnetic @xmath0er fermions , spin - polarized in the lowest zeeman sublevel . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> elastic collisions arise purely from universal dipolar scattering . based on cross - dimensional rethermalization experiments , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a strong anisotropy of the scattering , which manifests itself in a large angular dependence of the thermal relaxation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our result is in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we measure the rethermalization rate as a function of temperature for different angles and find that the suppression of collisions by pauli blocking is not influenced by the dipole orientation .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of any many - body system follows from the interactions of its constituent particles . in some cases of physical interest , </S>",
    "<S> importantly at ultralow temperature , where the de broglie wavelength is the dominant length scale , these interactions can be simplified by appealing to the wigner threshold laws@xcite . these laws , which have been extensively studied for particles interacting via van der waals forces , both in experiment and theory@xcite , identify the interactions via simple isotropic parameters such as a scattering length . however , for dipolar particles , the fundamental interaction is anisotropic and the system properties can depend on the orientation of the gas with respect to a particular direction in space.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the major strengths of ultracold matter is its susceptibility to being controlled by various means . </S>",
    "<S> striking examples include traversing the bec - bes crossover@xcite , welding atoms together into molecules@xcite , and inducing bosons to behave like fermions in one spatial dimension@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . most often , such control exploits the quantum mechanical nature of a many - body gas at ultralow temperature , and arises from the manipulation of isotropic scattering between constituent particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of dipolar particles the scattering is intrinsically anisotropic , affording novel opportunities to control the behavior of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the anisotropic @xmath1-wave collapse of a bose - einstein condensate of magnetic atoms@xcite and the deformation of the fermi sphere in a dipolar fermi gas@xcite have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena rely on the collective behavior of all the particles , occurring according to their mean field energy .    </S>",
    "<S> distinct from such many - body effects , dipoles can also influence the properties of the gas via two - body scattering . </S>",
    "<S> since scattering of dipoles is highly anisotropic , properties that require the collisional exchange of energy and momentum between the atoms , such as sound propagation , viscosity , and virial coefficients@xcite , will be influenced by the presence of dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , differential cross sections of dipolar particles are highly anisotropic , depending on both the initial , as well as scattered , relative directions of the colliding particles , and it has recently been predicted that dipolar anisotropy can exert a profound influence on the non - equilibrium dynamics in such a gas@xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the control of the thermal relaxation dynamics of a dipolar fermi gas driven out of equilibrium by adding excess momentum along one axis . </S>",
    "<S> the control is achieved by changing the orientation of the dipoles relative to this direction , enabling us to substantially vary the rethermaliztion rate . as a striking consequence of the interaction anisotropy , we find that the rate of equilibration can vary by as much as a factor of four , depending on the angle between the dipole orientation and the excitation axis . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe that the rethermalization rate decreases as the temperature is lowered . this effect is due to the lack of available final states into which atoms can scatter and is known as pauli blocking . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide evidence that the pauli suppression of collisions does not contribute additional anisotropic effects to the rethermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> to realize a dipolar fermi gas , we use an ultracold spin - polarized sample of strongly magnetic erbium ( er ) atoms , which possess a magnetic dipole moment of 7 bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> this is an ideal system to study purely dipolar scattering since short - range van der waals forces give a negligible contribution to the scattering of identical fermions at ultralow temperatures@xcite . our experimental procedure to create a degenerate fermi gas of @xmath0er atoms follows the one described in ref.@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> while the crucial role of the long - range character of the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) clearly emerges in the evaporation of spin - polarized fermions , the role of the anisotropy of the interaction is more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this aspect by studying for various dipole orientations how the system rethermalizes when it is excited out of its equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole orientation is controlled by changing the direction of the polarizing magnetic field and is represented by the angle @xmath15 between the magnetic field and the weak axis of the odt ; see inset fig.[fig : fig_therm ] .    </S>",

    "<S> the excitation brings the system out of equilibrium by transferring energy mainly in the direction of the weak axis ( @xmath23 ) , which we refer to as the _ excitation axis_. this process is nearly adiabatic with respect to the trap period for the radial motion and introduces an initial temperature imbalance of about @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the re - equilibration dynamics by recording the time evolution of the temperature along the @xmath5 direction , @xmath25 , and we extract the rethermalization rate for the given dipole orientation .    </S>",

    "<S> we observe that the re - equilibration dynamics strongly depends on @xmath15 with @xmath25 approaching the new equilibrium value in a near - exponential way . from an exponential fit to the data , we extract the relaxation time constant @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the slower rethermalization ( i.e.largest @xmath26 ) is found to occur for dipoles oriented perpendicular to the excitation axis , whereas by changing @xmath15 by about @xmath27{^\\circ}$ ] we observe that the system re - equilibrates about four times faster . </S>",

    "<S> the integration yields an energy - independent @xmath33 , which is universally related to the fermions dipole moment @xmath1 by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the mass and @xmath40 the planck constant , is the characteristic length scale of the dipolar interaction @xcite . a collision rate </S>",

    "<S> . owing to the anisotropy of the dipolar collision cross section , we find that @xmath46 is , in general , different in the three directions @xmath62 .    both the experimental and theoretical results show a strong angular dependence of @xmath46 , which largely varies in a sine - like manner from about 1 to 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is unique to dipolar scattering and occurs because dipolar particles have a spatial orientation dictated by the magnetic field and the collision processes depend on this orientation @xcite . given this angular dependence , dipoles can re - equilibrate on a timescale that can be even faster than the one achievable with short - range @xmath14-wave collisions ( @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the rethermalization is the most efficient ( smallest @xmath46 ) when @xmath63{^\\circ}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen qualitatively from the form of the cross sections in ref.@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in this reduced case , the differential cross section for scattering of dipolar fermions has the simple angular dependence @xmath68 , thus the most likely scattering occurs when @xmath69 . for the most efficient rethermalization one requires scattering at right angles , @xmath70{^\\circ}$ ] , and therefore collisions in which the atoms approach one another at @xmath71{^\\circ}$ ] . at the same time , from the experimental geometry one requires a high collision rate between the radial and axial trap directions . from these considerations , </S>",

    "<S> another central aspect in the scattering of ultracold fermions in the degenerate regime is related to pauli blocking of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is caused by the lack of unoccupied final states in a scattering event and leads to a reduction of the elastic collision rate , which has been observed in fermionic systems with short - range interaction@xcite . in the case of dipolar scattering </S>",
    "<S> , it is an interesting question whether or not the pauli blocking effect exhibits anisotropy .    to address this question experimentally , </S>",
    "<S> we explore the temperature dependences of @xmath26 for two different angles , @xmath72{^\\circ}$ ] and @xmath74{^\\circ}$ ] , for which @xmath46 differs by a factor of two ; see fig.[fig : fig_angledep ] . </S>",

    "<S> we use @xmath95 as a variational expression for the deviation function corresponding to a thermal anisotropy in the @xmath23-direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the approach used to calculate @xmath46 as a function of @xmath15 for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution in ref.@xcite and used to calculated the shear viscosity in a gas interacting with @xmath14-wave interactions  @xcite .    by calculating the thermal relaxation rate using eq.([rate ] ) with either a pure @xmath14-wave or a pure @xmath49-wave interaction </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the relative suppression of the rate compared to the classical value is essentially the same in the two partial wave channels for a given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the pauli blocking effect is largely insensitive to the angular dependence of the cross section of the atoms . </S>",

    "<S> as explained above , the calculation yields essentially the same result when we assume @xmath14-wave scattering . by fitting the theoretical curve to the observed rethermalization rates with a single free scaling parameter for each angle </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the values of @xmath99 to be @xmath100{cm^2}$ ] at @xmath72{^\\circ}$ ] and @xmath101{cm^2}$ ] at @xmath102{^\\circ}$ ] , where the errors are statistical errors of fitting and systematic uncertainties on temperature , trap frequencies , and atom number , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the theory and experiment results are in good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that the reduction of the rethermalization rate is indeed due to pauli blocking and that it is not significantly influenced by the polarization angle .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the rethermalization dynamics of indistinguishable dipolar fermions after the system is excited out of thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed that the rate of equilibration can strongly vary depending on the polarization direction of the atoms magnetic dipole moments , which demonstrates a remarkable influence of anisotropic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> further , we note that the anisotropy has no significant influence on the pauli blocking effect . </S>",
