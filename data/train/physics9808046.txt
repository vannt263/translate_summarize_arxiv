    "particle production via electromagnetic processes in peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions has received significant study recently , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically ( for reviews , see @xcite ) , due to anticipated experimental opportunities at colliding - beam accelerators , and the importance of this phenomena for the operation and performance of such facilities . also of interest is the opportunity to study strong - field qed effects in particle production over a wide range of charge and collision energy @xcite .    the high - energy limit of peripheral relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been recently examined , and closed - form expressions for the amplitudes describing electron - positron pair production have been obtained @xcite .",
    "these new results offer significant insight into the understanding of relativistic heavy - ion collision dynamics @xcite . in these works , the consequences of allowing the collision velocity to approach the speed of light , i.e.@xmath0 , and thus the collision energy to approach infinity , @xmath1 , have been investigated .",
    "this limit has been motivated by the progress toward new colliding - beam heavy - ion accelerator facilities currently in various stages of construction and planning . the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory will begin operation in 1999 , offering collision velocities in the collider frame of @xmath2 . the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , currently being planned at cern , will offer collision velocities which more closely approach the speed of light , @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , in experiments recently performed at cern s sps @xcite , in which heavy - ions collide in a fixed - target mode , the equivalent collider - frame collision velocity exceeds @xmath4 , suggesting that the high - energy limit is already a meaningful and relevant approximation for use in interpreting the experimental results @xcite .    of central importance to recent investigations of the high - energy limit",
    "is the use of a simplified form , accurate to leading order in the small parameter @xmath5 , for the lorentz - boosted coulomb potential @xcite acting between the active electron and a bare nucleus . in this form ,",
    "the dependence of the interaction on the transverse electron coordinates separates from the dependence on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath6 and the time @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the latter arises in combinations identified as the lightfront variables , e.g.  @xmath8 , in the form of a zero - range or _",
    "sharp _ potential .",
    "the separability of this interaction in the time - dependent , two - center dirac equation allows for its closed - form solution @xcite .",
    "however , this useful form becomes apparant at the high energy limit only after applying phase transformations so as to remove the long - range @xmath6 dependence of the interaction@xcite .    in this present work ,",
    "we study these phase transformations and show how they constitute well - defined gauge transformations while from a parallel perspective they formally define an interaction - representation in which the asymptotic ( i.e.  @xmath9 ) interaction of an electron with a distant ion is absorbed into a redefinition of the electronic states . in this representation , which we call the _ short - range representation _ , the asymptotic channel states are free from effects of the distant ion , and in the high energy limit of infinite @xmath10 the interaction has zero range . in the high - energy limit ,",
    "the separation is exact . for finite @xmath10 ,",
    "the short - range interaction is an approximation correct to order @xmath5 , and so are the asymptotic channel wave functions . neither the two - center dirac equation , nor its boundary conditions , are rigorously separable for finite @xmath10 .    in this context , we review the pioneering work of eichler and co - workers @xcite referred to by the name _ coulomb - boundary conditions _ , where the long - range coulomb or linard - wiechert interaction was replaced by an effective short - range interaction .",
    "we show how corrections of order @xmath5 , explicit in our formal definition of the short - range representation , are implicit in the replacement procedure of the electron - projectile distance by the target - projectile distance that was used to obtain the asymptotic channels with these coulomb - boundary conditions .    in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the asymptotic channel solutions for the two - center dirac equation for extremely relativistic ( @xmath11 ) heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we derive factored forms for the asymptotic solutions which are accurate to order @xmath5 , i.e.  they are exact in the high - energy limit ( @xmath12 ) . in sec .",
    "ii a , we consider the case where the electron is asymptotically referred to the target reference frame ( i.e.  the electron is near to the target as @xmath9 ) , while in sec .",
    "ii b , we consider the case were the electron is asymptotically near to neither the target nor the projectile ion , and is most naturally referred to the collider ( center - of - velocity ) frame . in sec .",
    "iii , we define and present the short - range representation and derive from it the high - energy or sharp limit for the two - center dirac equation in a simple form . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that the phase transformation defining the short - range representation constitutes a gauge transformation . in so doing , we make explicit the connection between the coulomb - boundary conditions and the gauge transformations first used by baltz , rhoades - brown , and weneser in numerically solving the two - center dirac equation via coupled - channel methods@xcite .",
    "alternative treatments of the asymptotic electron - projectile distance and alternative phase choices for the asymptotic channels are discussed in the appendices .",
    "we study relativistic heavy - ion collisions with a single active electron , e.g.  we neglect electron - electron interactions in comparison to the strong electron - ion interactions .",

    "the reason this is of primary importance is that the extreme relativistic limit of the two - center dirac equation in the short - range representation for heavy - ion collisions simplifies remarkably , and allows for closed form solutions for pair - production amplitudes in this limit .    with these goals in mind ,",

    "we note however , that there is no unique way to derive `` replacements '' .",
    "when the purpose is to have a good basis - set for numerical calculation , a replacement procedure is a useful and adequate approximation . on the other hand , if one is treating the problem in a formal approach , as was recently done for the high - energy collision limit in refs .",
    "@xcite , the rigorous definition of the short - range representation as presented here is of significant importance . in regard to using the factored solution as an accurate , but approximate , asymptotic channel solution for calculation of high - energy collision phenomena , one should keep in mind that the factored solution , e.g.  the phase factor times a single - center eigenstate , is an exact solution to the two - center dirac equation for asymptotically large times , _ only _ in the limit @xmath73 .",

    "we here have discussed two different approaches for identifying the asymptotic electron - projectile separation .",
