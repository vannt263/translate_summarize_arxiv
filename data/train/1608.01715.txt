    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are extremely energetic explosions with enormous gamma - ray radiation .",
    "the observational properties of grbs demand that they originate from relativistic jets beaming towards earth ( see @xcite for reviews ) . observations of grb afterglows further reveal that these jets are narrowly beamed with a typical opening angle around 0.1 rad @xcite .",
    "the so - called long grbs ( with durations longer than two seconds ) are widely believed to be associated with the death of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the possible mechanisms to launch a relativistic jet from the central engine ( likely a hyper - accreting black hole or a millisecond magnetar ) include magnetohydrodynamical processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) or neutrino annihilation processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . after launching",
    ", the jet propagates through and breaks out the stellar envelope of the progenitor star before emitting @xmath4-ray photons at a large radius .",
    "this paper focuses on the grb jet propagation process inside the progenitor star .",
    "previous studies have revealed some main characteristics of a propagating , constant - luminosity jet .",
    "@xcite first used hydrodynamical simulations to show that a light jet can penetrate through a star and remains highly beamed .",
    "later , jet propagation has been investigated by many authors using different codes that implement special relativity and improved numerical resolutions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works showed detailed temporal and angular properties of the jets emerging from massive stars . in the meantime",
    ", analytical studies have been carried out on the topic @xcite . according to these analytical and numerical approaches , the basic picture for jet propagation may be summarized in the evolution of two phases defined by the time domains before and after the jet breaks out the surface of the star , respectively . during the first jet penetrating phase ,",
    "one may spatially define five structures : beam , envelope , jet head , cocoon , and multiple oblique collimation shocks . when the beam is injected from the base of the star , a collimation shock",
    "@xcite would emerge to generate the pressure needed to counterbalance the pressure from the surrounding materials ( the cocoon ) .",
    "the jet begins to propagate by pushing aside the matter in front of it . as a consequence , a jet head consisting of a forward shock ( fs ) and a reverse shock ( rs ) would form . the beam material shocked by the rs",
    "would expand due to high pressure , which forms the jet cocoon .",
    "the stellar envelope materials shocked by the fs would also flow sideways to form the jet cavity .",
    "the jet cocoon and jet cavity are called cocoon as a whole in this paper for simplicity . during the jet s expedition to the stellar surface ,",
    "some further collimating oblique shocks occur due to a cycle of expansion and collimation of the jet @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the shear motion between the shocked beam and the shocked envelope materials would produce some turbulent structures in the cocoon .",
    "after the jet breaks out the star , the jet would be accelerated to a higher lorentz factor ( @xmath5 5 times of the initial lorentz factor ) and the opening angle gets relatively smaller than the initial opening angle @xcite .",
    "finally , the jet becomes internally free - expanding , bounded by a shear layer .    in most of these previous simulations , a steady , constant - luminosity has been assumed .",
    "in reality , grb jets are likely intermittent in nature , as revealed by their erratic lightcurves @xcite .",
    "even though the emission sites and processes that give rise to the observed grb lightcurves are still subject to debate ( e.g. photospheric emission @xcite , internal shocks @xcite , or internal collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence @xcite ) , all these models attribute all or part of the variability time scales to the intrinsic intermittent activities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the precession activities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the central engine",
    ".    numerical studies of propagation of intermittent jets in grb progenitor stars have been carried out by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the fast engine variability in the injected jets could be preserved after the jet emerges from the star .",
    "@xcite showed that the interaction between the episodic jet and the progenitor stellar envelope can lead to an asymmetric behavior in the light curves of grbs .",
    "their results suggested a correlation between the duty cycle period of the central engine variability and the breakout time .",
    "furthermore , they pointed out that the general trend and behavior in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations are basically similar to those in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations .",
    "however , the envelope model used in their simulations is simplified , with the progenitor star as a background without rotation or infall due to core collapse .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the propagation of relativistic , hydrodynamic , intermittent grb jets in a star with more realistic physical conditions through numerical simulations .",
    "the progenitor star used in our simulations is rotating and collapsing due to gravity . in order to find out how intermittent jets drill out the star ,",
    "we perform a series of 2.5-dimensional ( 2.5d , 2d plus rotation ) simulations in which jets are injected intermittently from the central engine . for simplicity , the intermittent jets are characterized as a periodic step function with the same active and quiescent durations , @xmath0 , which is half of the duty cycle period . from these simulations , we intend to study how the parameter @xmath0 affects the ability of the jet to break out the star .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "numerical simulation setup is presented in section 2 .",
    "detailed information for the numerical methods is described in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we show the numerical results , which are followed by a discussion of the analytical understanding of these results in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "our first step is to obtain the structure of a rotating massive star envelope in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "according to @xcite , the 16ti model is one of the promising grb progenitor models . in this subsection",
    ", we try to construct our envelope model to mimic the 16ti model .",
    "since the envelope of 16ti model is nearly radiation - dominated , a polytropic equation of state @xmath6 is adopted , where @xmath7 is pressure and @xmath8 is density .",
    "we consider a simple barotropic star , i.e. , @xmath9 is a constant . after assuming that the star is axisymmetric about its rotational axis , the main task left is to solve the euler equations with rotation ( see @xcite ) @xmath10 and the integral form of the poisson equation @xmath11 here @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the gravitational potential @xmath12 and angular velocity @xmath13 are all functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the gravitational constant .",
    "spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are adopted in the formulation .    before solving equations ( 1 - 3 ) ,",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherical equilibrium non - rotating star is used as the initial guess for the 2d rotating star .",
    "we first solve the simple equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the enclosed mass .",
    "we integrate this equation from a starting radius @xmath19 ( @xmath20 cm ) , using the runge - kutta method .",
    "the mass inside @xmath19 is set as @xmath21 , and the density at @xmath19 is set as @xmath22 g  @xmath23 , so that the radius of this 1d star is @xmath24 cm , and the total mass of the star is @xmath25 . using this 1d solution as an initial guess , we then apply the hachisu s self - consistent field ( hscf ) method ( see @xcite for details ) to get the 2d configuration of a rotating star .",
    "a realistic star may have different layers obeying different rotation laws due to differential rotation @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations have shown that the distribution of the angular velocity as a function of the mass coordinate may be approximated as a step - function @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity may be treated as a constant in the core region that encloses a mass @xmath26 ( @xcite , see also figure 16 of @xcite ) . since our problem",
    "mostly concerns the core region of the star where the jet penetrates , for simplicity , we assume rigid rotation , i.e. , @xmath27constant , throughout the paper to ease the numerical simulation problem .",
    "moreover , the axis ratio @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the polar radius and the equatorial radius respectively ) is taken as 0.7 , which corresponds to a critical ( or break - up ) rotation configuration @xcite .",
    "our results give @xmath31 rad  s@xmath32 , which is consistent with the value in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one may note that the surface velocity of this star is larger than observed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is mainly due to the assumption of rigid rotation .",
    "however , this would not strongly affect the results of jet propagation study below since the jet is moving along the polar direction .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 shows the density distribution of the rotating star , which is used as an input in the next step .      according to the popular grb central engine models ,",
    "the grb jet is launched through the accretion of envelope materials into the central black hole ( bh ) .",
    "therefore as the jet is launched , the star should undergo collapsing after the core collapses to a bh and losses radiation support . in the following ,",
    "we try to set up a collapsing star into which the grb jet is injected .    in our simulations ,",
    "we treat the inner region ( @xmath33 cm ) of the star as a newly formed bh , of which the mass is @xmath34 .",
    "the collapsing of the envelope can be modeled by setting the boundary condition to be a type of outflow ( the gradients of all quantities are zero , also see @xcite ) .",
    "the rarefaction wave triggered at the inner boundary would cause infall of the matter at the radius it reaches . since the self - gravity module in the pluto code ( see section 3 for details ) is not fully implemented yet , we adopt an approximation method to treat the effects of gravity .",
    "for a point at radius @xmath14 , its acceleration in the radial direction is calculated as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 cm is the inner boundary , and @xmath38 is the mass of the central bh .",
    "notice that @xmath38 is increasing with time due to the infall of matter in our calculation .",
    "the justification of this treatment can be seen in the lower panel of figure 1 , where we plot the specific angular momentum @xmath39 at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for both a schwarzschild black hole ( green ) and a kerr black hole ( red ) as a function of the black hole mass , together with the equatorial specific angular momentum @xmath39 of the star ( blue ) as a function of the mass enclosed . during the jet launching phase , the black hole in our simulation grows from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "one can see that at the equator , the stellar @xmath39 is larger than @xmath39 at isco , so that infall is impossible .",
    "this is consistent with the formation of an accretion torus that powers the grb @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath39 values of the star decreases with decreasing polar angle @xmath15 , so",
    "that below a critical angle , vertical infall into the black hole becomes possible . at the extreme case with @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath39 is essentially zero for the stellar materials . in our simulation , when gravity is turned on , steady growth of the black hole is observed .    using the envelope solution obtained in section 2.1 , we simulate the collapsing process using the hydrodynamic module provided in pluto and get the structure of the star at a specific time .",
    "we then move on to launch a relativistic jet from @xmath43 starting from this epoch .",
    "when the jet is launched , we neglect self - gravity of the envelope , but consider the point - mass gravity of the central bh .",
    "since our objective is to study jet propagation , we simply inject a relativistic jet via boundary conditions without simulating the jet launching processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the first principles .",
    "the jet is characterized by three parameters , i.e. , luminosity ( @xmath44 ) , initial lorentz factor ( @xmath45 , corresponding velocity @xmath46 ) , and half - opening angle ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions can be set up correspondingly .",
    "we denote density , pressure , and internal energy density of the jet in the fluid frame as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 respectively , then the energy density in the lab frame can be expressed as @xmath51 where we have assumed the adiabatic index as 4/3 ( @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath54 is related to @xmath44 by @xmath55    when the internal energy of the material is fully converted to kinetic energy , it would reach a terminal lorentz factor @xmath56 , which is calculated as @xmath57 equations ( 6 - 8 ) are essential to infer @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( initial conditions of the jet ) given @xmath44 , @xmath47 , @xmath45 , and @xmath56 .",
    "in this paper , we fix @xmath58 erg  s@xmath32 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , unless noted otherwise .",
    "the initial opening angle @xmath47 is set to vary to investigate its effect on jet propagation .",
    "all the simulations presented here were performed using the pluto code , version 4.2 .",
    "the pluto code is built on the godunov - type shock - capturing schemes , aiming to the solution of newtonian , relativistic flows ( see @xcite for a full description ) .    in this work ,",
    "spherical coordinates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are employed and axisymmetry is assumed for all simulations .",
    "the collapsing process of the star is simulated using the hydrodynamic ( hd ) module provided in pluto .",
    "the star is immersed in a medium with a constant density @xmath61  g  @xmath23 .",
    "the computational domain covers a region of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the radial grid consists of 2048 points and is logarithmically distributed , while the angular grid is uniform with 256 points .",
    "a riemann solver , called hll solver ( harten - lax - van leer approximate riemann solver , see @xcite ) , a linear - type spatial reconstruction , and a second - order runge - kutta time integration were chosen in the simulations .    jet propagation is simulated using the relativistic hydrodynamic ( rhd ) module in pluto .",
    "specifically , we choose an extended harten - lax - van leer riemann solver ( called hllc solver , see @xcite ) , a so - called `` ospre_lim '' flux limiter using a piecewise linear interpolation @xcite , and a second - order runge - kutta time integration . as a result",
    ", we achieve second - order accuracy in both space and time .",
    "the computational domain covers a region of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "adaptive mesh refinement @xcite is adopted to improve the computational efficiency .",
    "there are altogether 6 grid levels in our setup , of which the base grid consists of @xmath64 uniform grid cells , and the refinement ratio is 2 . with this setup ,",
    "the highest resolution of the grid is @xmath65 , which is comparable with previous 2d studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in order to ensure that our simulation results are reliable , we first perform one baseline simulation to directly compare with the results of @xcite . in this simulation",
    ", we use a simple power - law model for a non - rotating star with a mass of @xmath66 and a surface radius of @xmath67 cm , without considering gravity .",
    "all the jet parameters are the same as those of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . the inner boundary is set to @xmath71 cm and the grid setup is the same as that in section 3 .",
    "figure 2 upper panel shows the density distributions at three epochs , @xmath72 s , respectively .",
    "it can be noticed that the jet breakout time is @xmath73 s , which is almost the same as the value of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the structure of the collimation shock , the cocoon , and the bow shock after the jet breakout time are also in good agreement with previous works . on the other hand , low - resolution spherical coordinates would lead to numerical baryon loading @xcite .",
    "we then diagnosed the resolution of our setup by checking whether bernoulli s constant @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the specific enthalpy ) along the jet axis is conserved .",
    "figure 3 shows that @xmath74 along the jet axis is conserved up to the jet head , except for some fluctuations due to internal shocks .",
    "also in this figure , the evolution of @xmath76 shows that the core of the unshocked jet is free - streaming up to the converging position of the collimation shock .",
    "therefore , using pluto our grid setup is reliable for the purpose of this research .",
    "the star is already collapsing before jet launching .",
    "however , the exact jet launching delay time is not known .",
    "we choose a moderate value for this delay time , i.e. , 24 s , in our simulations .",
    "figure 4 shows the density profiles in the equatorial and axial directions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 s after the collapse , respectively .",
    "a shock wave produced by centrifugal bounce is predicted to emerge during the collapse @xcite .",
    "this shock wave does not appear in figure 4 .",
    "this may be caused by the approximate treatment used here on self - gravity ( equation 5 ) .",
    "however , this would not affect much our following results , since the primary density profile in figure 4 is still similar to that in @xcite . using this envelope as the initial condition",
    ", we perform two series of simulations for intermittent jets .",
    "the jets are characterized by periodic injections with top - hat constant luminosity in each episode and with same duration during the on and off states .",
    "we simulate four intermittent jets with half period @xmath79 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 4.0 s , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also simulate a baseline constant luminosity jet . for each case",
    ", we perform two simulations with the jet opening angle being @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the simulation models are named in the form of `` mn1tn2 '' , with n1 denoting the value of the @xmath47 and n2 denoting the value of @xmath0 . for constant luminosity jets ,",
    "n2 is replaced by `` con '' .",
    "the detailed parameters for all these models are listed in table 1 .",
    "the density distributions of the m10tcon model at three epochs , @xmath82 s , respectively , are presented in the lower panel of figure 2 .    from these simulations ,",
    "we investigate the relationship between the breakout time ( @xmath1 ) and the half period ( @xmath0 ) , which is presented in figure 6 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath83 s , @xmath1 is significantly different for the two different @xmath47 values , while for other values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 depends weakly on @xmath47 . in comparison with the results of @xcite , under the same initial condition ( @xmath84 )",
    ", the trend of our @xmath85 relation is similar to the 3d result in @xcite , but is different from their 2d result .",
    "we should note that the oblate configuration of the envelope is the main reason that makes the difference of the absolute values of @xmath1 between our results and the results in @xcite .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show the snapshot lorentz factor maps ( color ) and density distributions ( grey ) for two sets of intermittent jet simulations .",
    "the cases of constant luminosity jets are presented in figure 5 for comparison .",
    "the epoch for the snapshot for each model roughly corresponds to the time when the first episode of the jet reaches the simulation boundary .",
    "to identify fast moving ejecta , only regions with @xmath86 are shown in color . from figs . 7 and 8",
    ", one can see spatially separated high-@xmath76 regions that manifest the intermittent injection of the central engine .",
    "one most striking finding from our simulations is that intermittent jets with a relatively short half - period do not have every sub - pulse emerges from the star .",
    "after the first pulses escape the star at @xmath1 , some sub - pulses vanish during their propagation inside the star .",
    "here we define  jet vanishing \" as lorentz factor drops below 2 .",
    "for example , for model m10t0.2 , after @xmath1 ( 6.47 s ) , the next jet pulse that can reach the outer boundary breaks out the star surface at @xmath5 11.6 s. for model m10t1.0 , after @xmath1 ( 6.0 s ) , only the 7th pulse ( ejected during 1213 s ) and later ones are able to reach the outer boundary .",
    "figure 9 gives some details of m10t1.0 simulation .",
    "the top panel ( @xmath87 s ) shows that the first three pulses ( p1 - 3 ) merge and break out from the star at @xmath88 , and that the 4th pulse ( p4 ) was just ejected from the engine ( head at @xmath89 ) . in the next two panels ( @xmath90 s )",
    ", one can see p4 gradually vanishes .",
    "the fifth pulse ( p5 ) seen in the @xmath91 s panel and the sixth pulse ( p6 ) seen in the @xmath92 s panel all gradually vanish before penetrating through the star . only until pulse 7 ( p7 ) ,",
    "as seen in the @xmath93 s panel manages to breakout the star again at @xmath94 s.    for relatively large half - period intermittent jets ( @xmath95 s ) , the sub - pulse vanishing events do not happen .",
    "every sub - pulse can manage to break out the star separately .",
    "the numerical results can be understood using some analytical treatments .",
    "let us first consider the propagation of a continuous jet .",
    "our numerical results ( m5tcon and m10tcon ) can be directly compared with the results of the analytical model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the jet head velocity is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the ambient medium density in the polar direction , @xmath99 is the jet cross section and can be further derived by considering the pressure balance between the jet and the cocoon . in order to get the analytical formulae for @xmath99 , four coefficients , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ,",
    "are introduced to simplify the derivation ( see @xcite for details ) . in short",
    ", @xmath103 is a parameter to correct the approximation of the cylindrical cocoon shape , @xmath100 represents the correction to the mean density of medium in the cocoon , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the corrections to the approximations of jet head position and cocoon width , respectively .",
    "when the density profile in the poloidal direction is a power - law @xmath104 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 can be expressed as @xmath105 , @xmath106 . after introducing these coefficients ,",
    "the jet head velocity and jet head position can be finally calculated as @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is assumed ( which gives @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) . by adjusting the parameter @xmath103",
    ", we can fit the numerical results with the analytical solution in equation ( 11 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the comparison between the analytical solution ( @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath70 ) and the numerical results .",
    "the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical results . in this figure ,",
    "the analytical solutions are obtained using equation ( 11 ) with the density slope @xmath115 at @xmath116 .    for @xmath79 s intermittent jets , @xmath1 in m5t0.2 and m10t0.2",
    "are significantly different from each other .",
    "the narrow jet ( m5t0.2 ) travels much faster ( @xmath117 s ) than the wide jet ( m10t0.2 ) ( @xmath118 s ) .",
    "this is caused by two reasons .",
    "first , for a smaller @xmath47 , the energy is deposited on a smaller area so that the jet is more penetrating ( jet pulse is narrower and move faster ) in the polar direction .",
    "second , the breakout in these short @xmath0 models is triggered by the expanding cocoon . in these models ,",
    "stellar materials are shocked into a hot cocoon matter by the vanishing jet pulses . when a bow shock forms at the stellar surface , there is only a small amount of jet matter ( with high @xmath76 ) near the surface , so that the outgoing materials are mostly from the cocoon .",
    "the larger the @xmath47 , the wider the cocoon ( see figure 11 ) , and the smaller the expanding velocity in the polar direction .    for longer duty cycle jets , i.e. @xmath119  s , @xmath1 is not sensitive to @xmath47 .",
    "this is because the breakout of these cases is triggered by the jet pulses rather than the cocoon . as a result ,",
    "given the same @xmath0 , the jet breakout times for different @xmath47 values are defined by the same ejection time from the central engine .",
    "for example , in m5t2.0 and m10t2.0 , the 2nd jet pulse ejected during 46 s is powerful enough to lead to the breakout in both cases .",
    "the jet pulse vanishing in m10t0.2 and m10t1.0 but not in m10t2.0 and m10t4.0 can be understood . like a continuous jet , a jet head",
    "is also formed to evacuate the envelope matter in front of the jet pulse .",
    "the velocity of the jet head is smaller than that of the jet itself , so that the jet materials would flow across the rs into the jet head , and finally flow into the cocoon .",
    "if the jet pulse does not last for a long time , all the jet materials would go into the cocoon before the breakout of the jet head . for a jet pulse of an active duration of @xmath0",
    ", we assume that the average velocity of the jet head is @xmath120 .",
    "it would vanish after a duration @xmath121 by equaling @xmath122 and @xmath29 , one can obtain a critical duration @xmath123 below which the jet crosses the jet head before penetrating through the star , so that it would vanish . in our calculations , @xmath124 cm is adopted .",
    "our simulations show that @xmath125 could be reached for each pulse .",
    "one then gets @xmath126 s. as a result , a jet pulse would be able to drill out the stellar surface and reach the outer boundary if @xmath127 s is satisfied .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that jet vanishing does not appear in m5t2.0 or m10t2.0 .",
    "another condition for a successful jet pulse is that the next jet would not catch up with the prior jet within the duration @xmath128 , so a quiescent duration should not exceed @xmath129 .",
    "both conditions are satisfied for the @xmath3 s cases , but not satisfied for @xmath79 s and @xmath130 s cases ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "this explains the jet pulse vanishing phenomenon in our simulations with small @xmath0 .",
    "the collapsing envelope also plays a key role in destroying jet pulses . in comparison with m10t0.2 ,",
    "we run a simulation in which the star is not rotating or collapsing , and the jet is launched at @xmath131 cm ( a common value used by other authors ) .",
    "it is found that the jet vanishing does not exist in this simulation ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "this difference also holds if we move the injection radius in m10t0.2 from @xmath132  cm to @xmath133  cm . in figure 13",
    ", we can see that the cocoon structure without gravity is obviously wider than that in m10t0.2 .",
    "this in turn gives a larger pressure in the hot cocoon , which makes narrower jet pulses and stronger internal shocks to dissipation jet energy ( figure 14 ) .",
    "even though gravity does not affect jet dynamics directly , our results suggest that gravity in addition to rotation may influence the cocoon structure , and hence the jet dynamics .",
    "the jet pulse vanishing phenomenon in m10t0.2 or m10t1.0 indicates that there may be a time delay between the first breakout and the breakouts of subsequent jet pulses . in the case of m10t1.0",
    ", the time delay can reach @xmath5 7 s. this value could be even larger , if the engine quiescent time duration is even longer than the active time ( in our simulation we assumed the same duration ) .",
    "this motivates us to relate our simulation results to the lightcurve quiescent time between the grb precursor and its main emission .",
    "it has been found that @xmath515% of grbs have a precursor @xcite .",
    "the mean duration of the quiescence is @xmath5 50 s , of which the origin is still uncertain @xcite .",
    "our results can provide a reasonable explanation for such a quiescent time . according to our picture",
    ", the grb central engine may continuously eject episodic jets with short active time scales .",
    "initially , the several leading sub - pulses merge and break out the star with the mixed cocoon and jet matter , which produces the precursor .",
    "later , for a certain duration , the episodic jet pulses injected from the central engine gets vanished since the vanishing time @xmath128 is shorter than the jet penetrating time .",
    "the grb therefore displays a long gap of quiescence .",
    "finally , the funnel near the jet axis becomes more and more hollow , some episodic jets of long active periods can eventually escape the star to make radiation , making the main episode of the burst . according to our simulations",
    ", pulse vanishing happens only if @xmath0 is around or shorter than 1 s. observationally , the shortest variability time scale for long grbs is of the similar order .",
    "this also lends support to our model .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that within the context of a magnetically arrested disk around a bh , the characteristic timescale for the variability of the poynting flux jet is @xmath134  s. this also provides a physical standpoint for our scenario , i.e. , the jet pulses are characterized by a duty cycle period of the order of a second .",
    "however , we have not considered the role of magnetic fields on jet propagation in this work .",
    "there are two facts that support our proposal .",
    "the precursors and main events have very similar spectral properties @xcite , which implies that they share the similar radiation physics . in our explanation ,",
    "the precursor and the later main bursts are all from episodic jet pulses ejected from the same central engine , so that their emission properties should be similar .",
    "second , multiple precursors have been observed in many cases ( e.g. 73 cases in the @xcite sample ) . this fact is also a natural outcome in our scenario . after the initial breakout to produce the first precursor , in some grbs , the episodic jets may have relatively long active durations , so that they can subsequently break out the star to produce more precursors before the main burst comes .",
    "some others may have relatively short active time durations , so that they can only produce one precursor with a long quiescent gap before the main burst comes after the funnel is cleared .",
    "another interesting finding in our simulations is that later injected pulses are likely to catch up with the pulses injected earlier .",
    "grb internal shock models require that late shells to catch up with the early ones . in our simulations , even if all the pulses have the same initial energy and internal energy , later injected jet pulses are accelerated more quickly when the episodic jets propagate in the collapsing envelope .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "first group of pulses that break out the star at @xmath1 and make the precursor would evacuate a funnel along the jet axis direction , which can not be refilled quickly . as a consequence",
    ", pulses injected at later epochs would travel in a more stratified medium and therefore can be accelerated more quickly . in m5t0.2 ,",
    "later pulses can even catch up with the early ones within the simulation box ( see figure 15 ) .",
    "in this paper , we numerically modeled the propagation of a relativistic , hydrodynamic , intermittent jet in the envelope of a massive , rotating , and collapsing star for the first time . using the pluto code with specific setups , we performed a set of 2.5d simulations .",
    "because of the introduction of a more realistic rotating star and central gravity during the jet propagation phase , the following interesting results ( some of which were not obtained previously ) are obtained :    for intermittent jets , the shock breakout time @xmath1 depends on the jet opening angle when the half - period @xmath0 is short enough ( e.g. @xmath83  s ) .",
    "this is because for short @xmath0 , the reverse shock to each pulse crosses the shell before it penetrates through the star , so that the shock breakout is defined by that of a hot cocoon , the speed of which depends on the opening angle of the jet .",
    "when the half period is large enough ( @xmath135 s ) , the reverse shock crossing time becomes comparable or longer than the jet penetrating time , so that @xmath1 no longer sensitively depends on the jet opening angle .",
    "the @xmath85 relation trend obtained from our 2.5d results , is similar to that from 3d results in @xcite .    for short half - period jets ( @xmath136 s )",
    ", our simulations revealed some vanishing pulses after the first group of pulses break out the star .",
    "the vanish of sub - pulses is due to two reasons : that the reverse shock crosses the pulse before it penetrates the star and that a later pulse may have caught up with a preceding jet .",
    "such vanishing effect gives rise to a quiescent time after the initial shock breakout even if the engine is continuously ejecting intermittent pulses , and can be a mechanism to interpret the quiescent gap between the precursor and the main burst .",
    "such a behavior is only observed when a rotating , collapsing star is simulated .",
    "growing evidence suggests that grb prompt emission jets may carry a significant poynting flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the future",
    ", we plan to introduce strong magnetization in relativistic jets and numerically investigate the effect of strong magnetization on jet propagation .",
    "a more self - consistent setup of the collapsar including the magnetic fields may be also considered @xcite .",
