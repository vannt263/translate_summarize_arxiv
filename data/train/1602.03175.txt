    "this is the first draft to the paper , prepared so far only to appear in the proceedings as the talk of one of the authors ( h.b.f.n .. the contribution presents the main ideas for the fermionization / bosonization procedure in any dimension @xmath3 .",
    "more detailed explanation will appear in the paper .",
    "although many things are not yet strictly proven , the fermionization / bosonization seems , hopefully , to work in any dimensional space - time and also in the presence of a weak background field .",
    "we hope , that the fermionization / bosonization procedure might help to better understand why nature has made of choice of spins , charges and families of fermions and of the corresponding gauge and scalar fields , observed in the low energy regime and why the _ spin - charge - family _",
    "theory  @xcite might be the right explanations for all the assumptions of the standard model , offering the next step beyond the _ standard model_.",
    "this talk demonstrates that :    * bosonization / fermionization is possible in an arbitrary number of dimensions ( although the fermions theories are non - local due to the anticommuting nature of fermions , while bosons commute ) . * the number of degrees of freedom for fermions versus bosons obeys in our procedure in any dimension the aratyn - nielsen theorem  @xcite . *",
    "the number of families in four dimensional space - time is ( a multiple of ) four families .    to prove for massless fermions and bosons that the bosonization / fermionization is possible in an arbitrary number of dimensions we use the jacoby s triple product formula , presented by leonhard euler in 1748  [ 20 ] which is a special case of glaisher s theorem @xmath5 let the reader notices that the product on the left hand side runs over 0 and all positive integers , while on the right hand side it runs only over odd positive integers .",
    "we shall connect the left hand side with the fermion degrees of freedom and the right hand side with the boson degrees of freedom , recognizing that for all positive numbers the number of partitions with odd parts equals the number of partitions with distinct parts [ 19 ] .",
    "let us demonstrate this in a special case : + among the 22 partitions of the number 8 there are 6 that contain only odd parts , namely + ( 7 + 1 , 5 + 3 , 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 , 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 , 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 , + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) .",
    "this is to be connected with the boson ( the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ 11ue ] ) degrees of freedom .",
    "+ if we count partitions of 8 , in which no number occurs more than once , that is with distinct parts , we obtain again 6 such partitions , namely + ( 8 , 7 + 1 , 6 + 2 , 5 + 3 , 5 + 2 + 1 , 4 + 3 + 1 ) .",
    "this is to be correspondingly connected with the fermion ( the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ 11ue ] ) degrees of freedom .",
    "+ for every type of restricted partition there is a corresponding function for the number of partitions satisfying the given restriction .",
    "an important example is q(n ) , the number of partitions of n into distinct parts  @xcite .",
    "the generating function for q(n ) , partitions into distinct parts , is given by  [ 22 ] @xmath6 the first few values of q(n ) are ( starting with q(0)=1 ) : + ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 ,  ) the pentagonal number theorem can be applied giving a recurrence for q  @xcite : @xmath7 where a(k ) is @xmath8 , if @xmath9 for some integer m , and is 0 otherwise .        * bosonization illustrating formula * +    below the @xmath10 space dimensional version , @xmath11 , of eq .",

[ 11ue ] - while a boson can have any odd value @xmath16 of the momentum .",
    "both , the left and the right hand side manifest the same degrees of freedom . this can be seen if summing up on the fermionic side possibilities that @xmath15 of @xmath17 is a sum of all different integers , ( example 1 : factor @xmath18 at @xmath19 arises from the fact that @xmath20 ) , while at the boson ( right hand ) side the factor at @xmath21 is the sum of all possibilities that @xmath16 is written as a sum of positive odd integers ( example 1 : factor @xmath18 at @xmath22 arises from @xmath23 ) .    we can generalize this bosonization / fermionization procedure from @xmath24 to any dimensional space time @xmath25 as follows : +    * \\1 .",

    "we have made an important step arriving at a model suggesting how it could be possible to match momenta and energies for a system with either fermions or bosons . to completely show the existence of fermionization ( or looking the opposite way , bosonization ) we should",
    ", however , write down the formula for how the fermion ( boson ) creation and annihilation operators are constructed in terms of the boson ( fermion ) operators , so that it can become clear ( be proven ) that the phase conventions and identification of the specific states with a given total momentum and energy for fermions can be identified with specific states for the boson system .",
    "such a construction is well known for 1 + 1 dimensions , where it looks like @xmath53 in the \" position  representation , meaning that @xmath54 let us think of the case of making the field operators in position space @xmath55 hermitean by assumming @xmath56      at first one might naively think that - since each of our rays ( or classes ) c functions as the 1 + 1 dimensional system and we can write the whole fermion , as well as the whole boson , space according to ( [ firay ] ) - it would be trivial to obtain the bosonization for the whole system and thereby have achieved the bosonization in the arbitrary dimension , which is the major goal of this article .",
    "however , one should notice that constructing in a simple way a system composed from several independent subsystems such it is the whole system @xmath42 , composed from the subsystems @xmath43 ( for @xmath57 ) , one obtains _ commutation _ between operators acting solely inside one subsystem @xmath40 , say , and operators acting solely inside another subsystem @xmath58 , say .",
    "but we want for the fermions the _ anticommutation _ relations rather than the commutation ones , and thus some ( little ? ) trick is needed to achieve this anticommutation .",
    "first we shall show how this anticommutation can be achieved by means of an ordering of all the rays @xmath59 by some ordering inequality being chosen between these rays : @xmath60 .",
    "but this is a very ugly procedure and we shall develop a slightly more general attempt in which we construct a phase @xmath61 for each pair of rays @xmath40 and @xmath58 .",
    "then we shall go on seeking to make the choice of this phase @xmath62 in a continuous and more elegant way .",
    "since that shall turn out to be non - trivial , we shall develop the ideas by first seeking for such a construction of the phase for the odd dimensional space of @xmath63 , meaning @xmath64 , to learn the idea , although we are most keen on even space - time dimensions , such it is the experimentally observed number of space - time dimensions , @xmath65 .",
    "let us suppose that we have a formal way of constructing the fermion creation and annihilation operators in terms of the boson operators .",
    "we do indeed have such a construction , since we can fourier transform back and forth the construction in the position representation ( [ pos ] ) and the 1 + 1 dimensional bosonization is so well understood . since for the present problem the details of this 1 + 1 dimensional bosonization relations are not so important , we shall just assume that we are able to deduce for each ray or class @xmath40 a series of fermion creation - @xmath66 and @xmath67 - and annihilation - @xmath68 and @xmath69 - operators , that function well as fermion operators _ inside the ray @xmath40 _ , so to speak . @xmath70 and @xmath71 denotes odd and even , respectively .",
    "the only important think is that these operators _ can be expressed in terms of the boson annihilation and creation operators belonging to the same ray @xmath40 _ : @xmath72 for these operators we know form the 1 + 1 dimensional bosonization that we can take them to obey the usual anticommutation rules _ provided we keep to only one ray @xmath40 _ : @xmath73 we have similar anticommutation rules for annihilation and creation operators if exchanging the index @xmath70 ( meaning odd ) by the index @xmath71 ( meaning even ) , but now we should take into account that the fermion operators with zero momentum , i.e. @xmath74 , are not constructed from a single ray @xmath40 .",
    "rather there are - referring to our little problem with the explicit factor @xmath75 in the state counting formulae - not enough degrees of freedom in the 1 + 1 dimensional boson system to deliver a fermion operator with a zero momentum .",
    "we should therefore imagine that we do not have these zero momentum fermion operators attached to our rays either .",
    "this is actually good for our hopes of bosonizing in higher dimensions because the zero momentum fermion operators would have had to be common for the infinitely many rays and we would have had too many candidates for the zero momentum fermion mode .",
    "now instead we totally miss the zero momentum creation and annihilation fermion operators for the many dimensional system .",
    "that is , however , not at all so bad as it would have been to get an infinity of them , because we fundamentally can not expect to produce all fermion operators from boson ones because we can not possibly build up a sector with an odd number of fermions from boson operators acting on say some vacuum with an even number .",
    "therefore one fermion operator must be missing .",
    "this becomes the zero momentum one and that is o.k ..    our real problem remains that these naive fermion operators taken for two different rays , @xmath40 and @xmath76 , will commute @xmath77    we could define an @xmath78-operator , where @xmath79 is the fermion number operator .",
    "it sounds at first very easy just to write @xmath80 where the sums run over respectively the odd and the even positive values for @xmath16 for the @xmath70 and the @xmath71 components .",
    "but now this fermion number operator- as taken as a function of the _ naive _ operators - ends necessarily up being an expression in purely boson operators ( from the ray @xmath40 ) , and thus it looks at first as being valid except when the expression @xmath81 , which we are interested in , is equal to @xmath82 on all states that can truly be constructed from boson operators .",
    "if it were indeed so , our idea of using @xmath81 to construct the multidimensional fermion operators , would not be so good . however , there is a little detail that we did not have enough bosonic degrees of freedom to construct the zero momentum fermion operator in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "therefore we can not really include in the definition of the \" fermion number operator for the ray @xmath40  , @xmath83 , the term coming from @xmath84 .",
    "this term would formally have been @xmath85 , but we decided to leave it out .",
    "this then means that the fermion number operator , for which we decide to use @xmath83 as the number of fermions operator in the ray @xmath40 is _ not the full fermion number operator for the corresponding 1 + 1 dimensional theory , but rather only for those fermions , that avoid the zero momentum state_. to require this avoidance of the zero momentum is actually very attractive for defining a fermion number operator _ for the ray @xmath40 _ as far as the momentum states included in such a ray really must exclude the zero momentum state in a similar way as a ray in a vector space is determined from the set of vectors in the ray not being zero .",
    "but this precise definition avoiding the zero - momentum fermion operator contribution to the fermion number operator @xmath83 leads to the avoidance of the just mentioned problem that this fermion number @xmath83 looked as always having to be even when constructed in terms of boson operators .",
    "now there should namely be enough boson degrees of freedom that one should be able to construct by boson operators all the different possible combinations for fermion states being filled or unfilled ( still not the zero momentum included ) .",
    "thus one does by pure bosons construct both - the even @xmath83 and the odd @xmath83 - states and thus the @xmath83 with the zero momentum fermion state not counted can indeed be a function of the boson operators and can _ take on both even and odd values _ for momentum , depending on the boson system state .",
    "so , we can have - using this leaving out the zero momentum fermion state in the rays - an operator @xmath86 the operator @xmath81 for each ray @xmath40 counts if the number of fermions in the 1 + 1 dimensional system is even , then @xmath87 , or odd , then @xmath88 . we construct the following improved fermion operator ( annihilation or creation ) , @xmath89 the inclusion of this extra operator factor helps to convert the commutation relations between the fermion annihilation and creation operators for different rays into anticommutation relations , as it can easily be seen @xmath90 thus we deduced , for @xmath91 in our in fact at first just chosen ordering of @xmath92 , that the fermion operators do anticommute .",
    "it is not difficult to show similarly also in the case @xmath93 , that the fermion operators anticommute .",
    "the crux of the matter is that when e.g. @xmath94 there is the factor @xmath95 contained in the product @xmath96 , which is attached to @xmath97 in order to correct it into @xmath98 , while there is no analogous factor @xmath99 contained in the factor @xmath100 attached at @xmath101 in order to bring it into @xmath102 . in this way one gets just the one extra minus sign in the product of the fermion operators that makes them anticommute .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the idea of using such an ordering @xmath92 could be slightly generalized to have instead of the factors only minus or plus phase factors of the form @xmath103 @xmath104 it is also not difficult to see that , in order to obtain the anticommutation relations instead of the commutation ones ( which we have for @xmath105 ) , the phases must obey the rule @xmath106 we may in fact seek to evaluate the product of two fermion creation operators with the ansatz  ( [ phansatz ] ) @xmath107 where in the last step we used  ( [ picon ] ) .",
    "thus we see that in this way we can get - really in infinitely many ways - some algebraicly defined fermion operators that do indeed anticommute as they should .",
    "but it should be had in mind that both these procedures , by choosing @xmath61 and the forgoing proposal with the ordering @xmath92 , are a priori discontinuous and arbitrary .",
    "we expect , however , that the latter method with @xmath61 can be lead to a smooth and attractive scheme in the case of @xmath64 or equivalently @xmath63 .      in the case of",
    "@xmath64 we can say that the set of our @xmath41 form a kind of a set of `` rational angles  in the sense that each ray specifies an angle modulo @xmath109 ( rather than modulo @xmath110 as for an oriented arrow it would specify ) , but that one only obtains those angles which rationalize tangenses .",
    "but the fact that they are after all implemented as angles - although only modulo @xmath109 , means that they are at least locally ordered as numbers along a real or rather rational axis .",
    "so apart from troubles at the end and beginning we have an ordering and we could attempt to use it even for the implementation of the ordered set of rays method by proposing a ' ' nice ",
    "@xmath92 ordering .",
    "however , we think we get a better chance by using the @xmath61 method in this @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 case .    we have to think about what topological properties we shall and can achieve for the function @xmath61 depending on a pair of rays @xmath40 and @xmath58 .    since the classes or rays are \" a kind of rational  directions , though without orientation , the topological space of the rays is like the sphere @xmath111 with opposite points identified .",
    "this topological space obtained by the identification of the opposite point on the @xmath111 sphere is actually topologically identical to the projective space of @xmath112 dimensions .",
    "for the case @xmath63 or @xmath64 the topological space rays thus become simply the projective line ( using real numbers ) , but that is topologically just the @xmath113 circle .",
    "had this topological space been naturally orderable we could have used the ordering as the @xmath92 above .",
    "however , it is a circle @xmath113 and not a simple line with plus and minus infinity ; the infinities have so to speak been identified to only one point in the projective line .",
    "this means that using the method to define the fermion fields / operators by means of @xmath92-method would be very non - elegant , and would probably violate almost everything wanted .",
    "let us now think about a slight generalization by using the @xmath61 .",
    "we need to make a choice of a function @xmath114 defined on the cross product of two projective spaces of dimension @xmath115 each .",
    "since it shall obey the condition  ( [ picon ] ) , it can not at all be a smooth or continuous function at the points where @xmath116 .",
    "let us , for a while , take care that this method works well for @xmath63 only .",
    "in this @xmath63 case the cross product of the two projective lines becomes topologically simply a two - dimensional torus .",
    "so we face topologically to define @xmath61 on a two - dimensional torus .",
    "however , we are forced to give up having continuity along the `` diagonal  - meaning the set of points on this torus with @xmath116 - and it is thus rather a @xmath61 defined as a continuous function on the torus minus its ' ' diagonal  , which we must choose / find .    this two dimensional torus minus its `` diagonal  is rather like a belt .",
    "i.e. , it is topologically like the outer surface of a finite piece of a tube .",
    "it has two separate edges , each being topologically an @xmath113 circle , namely two images of the ' ' diagonal  seen from the two sides . in between there is then the two - dimensional bulk area of the topological shape of the surface of the finite piece of a tube .",
    "it is inside this bulk region that we shall attempt to construct @xmath61 to be smooth and \" nice  .",
    "choosing @xmath117 might be a good choice . here",
    "@xmath118 is the angle that the unoriented direction of slightly complicatedly defined angle - dividing line dividing the angle between the unoriented directions @xmath40 and @xmath58 forms with some coordinate axis ( in momentum space ) . the precise way of defining this @xmath119 is illustrated on the figure .",
    "it consists in the following ( let us remind the reader that we are still in the @xmath120 case ) :    * \\a .",
    "we introduce a \" clockwise rotation orientation  in the spatial momentum plane . *",
    "we draw a circle arrow from one of the two `` ends ",
    "( half lines ) of which the line @xmath40 ( the ray @xmath40 is basically just a line ) in this clockwise direction , and note the angle between this end of @xmath40 and the first ' ' end ",
    "( = half line ) of @xmath58 ( met in the following the circular arrow ) , which measures less than @xmath121 .",
    "we draw a line , that divide this under b. noted angular region into halves .",
    "this line through the ( momentum space ) origo is denoted `` clock average '' ( as marked on the figure ) . * \\d .",
    "such an unoriented line as the \" clock average  defines relative to a coordinate system in spatial momentum space an angle - value modulo @xmath109 .",
    "we call this angle - value @xmath118 and it is as just said defined modulo @xmath109 ( but only modulo @xmath109 , because the line `` clock average '' is unoriented ) . * \\e . multiplying this angle - @xmath118 - by 2 its ambiguity",
    "to be only defined modulo @xmath109 becomes instead an ambiguity modulo @xmath110 .",
    "thus our proposed expression  ( [ prop ] ) for @xmath61 is defined modulo @xmath110 , and that is what we need , since in our construction we exponentiate @xmath62 after multiplication by @xmath122 and an operator @xmath123 that has only integer eigenvalues .",
    "thus the expression , which we use , @xmath124 becomes well defined even though @xmath125 makes sense only modulo @xmath110 .",
    "* let us see whether this proposal is indeed a good one . * to see that our proposal  ( [ prop ] ) is a good one we must first of all check that it obeys  ( [ picon ] ) .",
    "that is we must see what happens to the expression when we permute the two independent variables @xmath40 and @xmath58 . since by definition the circular arrow constructed in step b. goes out from the @xmath40-line , the first of the two arguments in @xmath61 , we must draw this circle - arrow after the permutation from @xmath58 instead . therefore the half - angle noted under point b. above will after the permutation differ from the one before the permutation .",
    "this means that the line ( through the origo ) \" clock average  gets after the permutation perpendicular to its direction before the permutation of @xmath40 and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore @xmath126 , which means that this angle gets shifted modulo @xmath109 with @xmath127 .",
    "after the multiplication by @xmath18 ( point e. ) it means that @xmath128 , which is just  ( [ picon ] ) .",
    "thus we got indeed by proposal  ( [ prop ] ) the condition  ( [ picon ] ) fulfilled",
    ".    we can now remark that quite obviously our proposal  ( [ prop ] ) is continuous as function of the directions @xmath40 and @xmath58 _ except where @xmath40 and @xmath58 just coincide - what means that it is zero ( mod @xmath109 ) angle between them_. let us note that had we not chosen the clock - wise rule , but instead taken , say , the smallest angle between @xmath40 and @xmath58 and just found the halfening line between those `` ends ",
    ", we would have got a discontinuity when @xmath40 and @xmath58 were perpendicular to each other .",
    "but by our precise choice we avoided that singularity .",
    "( for a point close to the diagonal the two arguments , @xmath40 and @xmath58 , are approximately the same ray .",
    "permuting them will for a continuous function @xmath129 make almost no difference , and thus it can not possibly change by @xmath109 , while crossing the ' ' diagonal  the function @xmath130 would ask to jump by @xmath109 . )",
    "we propose the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ pos ] ) to an arbitrary dimension , due to our experience with the clifford objects ( apart from some modifications due to whether we choose weyl or majorana fermions for family or for geometrical components ) , by using the relation @xmath131",
    "we started with massless noninteracting bosons or fermions .",
    "but we want to work with the interacting fields .",
    "there are many kalb - ramond fields appearing in our type of fermionizable boson model in higher dimensions and correspondingly it is not easy to see how to make an interacting theory .",
    "there are many ways to come from noninteracting bosonisable ( fermionizable ) fermion ( boson ) fields , which might lead to the fermion fields interacting with the boson fields as it is in the _ spin - charge - family _ theory .",
    "but on the level of our fermionizable ( bosonizable ) boson ( fermion ) model with many kalb - ramond fields we must keep in mind that the conserved charges in the kalb - ramond theories are vectorial and thus one gets very many vectorial conserved quantities .",
    "this makes scattering processes ( unless all the scattering particles are without these vectorial charges ) very non - trivial .",
    "one chance would be to let either fermion or boson fields to interact with gravity . crudely speaking gravity couples to energy and momentum , and since in the free bosonization procedure",
    "we have at least sought to get the total d - momentum be the same in the corresponding states of fermions and bosons there might be a chance that we fermionize a theory with both - the bosons of the kalb - ramond type _ and _ gravity through the vierbein formulation - and correspondingly obtain a theory with both fermions _ and _ bosons , the later would be the gravity degrees of freedom .",
    "this might lead to exactly the theory  @xcite that one of us ( n.s.m.b . ) has postulated as the true model for nature beyond the standard model ( the _ spin - charge - family _ theory ) .    since our scheme a priori looks to require the majorana fermions to have real fields like the bosons - at least in the simplest version - we only expect to get chiral fermions in those dimensions wherein majorana fermions can simultaneously be weyl ( which means chiral )  @xcite as in d=2,6,10,14 ,",
    "... it is therefore even a slight support for the _ spin - charge - family _ theory that its phenomenologically favoured dimension is just 13 + 1 = 14 .",
    "one should for appreciating this idea of adding gravity without fermionizing it have in mind that one _ does not have to fermionize ( bosonize ) all degrees of freedom _ , but rather can - if one wishes - decide to fermionize ( bosonize ) some degrees of freedom but not all . especially , if the motivation were to make all fermions from bosons because one claims that fermions are not properly local and should not be allowed to exist , then of course it is enough that we start with a purely boson theory as the fundamental one - and then we better only fermionize a part of bosons unless we could identify a purely fermionic theory with nature .",

    "then this theory should be _ partly _ fermionized in the sense that only the series of kalb ramond fields get fermionized , but not the gravity ( bosonic ) degres of freedom .",
    "the latter remain gravitational degrees of freedom hopefully now functioning as gravity for the fermions that came out of the fermionization .",
    "the _ spin - charge - family _ theory will show up out of the kalb - ramond components .    1 .",
    "the first assumption of our new scheme , which might be the pre - scheme of the _ spin - charge - family _ theory , is that _ fermions a priori do not obey proper locality_. the accusation towards all the theories with fermions which are fundamental fermions rather than fermionized bosons is that the axiom of locality in a quantum field theory is for the fermions @xmath134 while true physical locality should have been a _ commutation rule _ like the one obeyed by the boson fields @xmath135 true locality means , one would think , that each little region in space is approximately a completely separate system that only interacts very indirectly with a far away different little region .",
    "if so , the physical operators describing the situation in one little region should commute with those describing the situation in a different little region , and not anticommute as the fermion fields do .",
    "one might like to assume that only products of an even number of fermion fields are considered as proper operators describing the little system region , what satisfies the requirement of getting commutation relations between the field variables describing the situation in different regions .",
    "but such an assumption must be justified as a physical assumption , discussing seriously also odd products of fermion fields .",
    "+ the point of view we suggest here is that we admit that we can not have fermions at all in a truly local way !",
    "this then means that the fundamental physics should be a model _ without fermions _ so that all fermions come from bosons that become fermionized .",
    "since it is not easy to find so terribly many systems of bosons that can be fermionized , and thus if one finds some way of fermionizing , then this way is presumably already likely to be almost the only one possible .",
    "+ at least we expect that the fermionization of a boson system of fields can only be made provided the number of fermions and the number of bosons agree with the theorem which one of us ( h.b.f.n . ) and aratyn  @xcite put forward many years ago . + for massless free fermions on the one side and massless free bosons on the other side we obtained that the number of components for the bosons and the fermions counted in the same way with respect to the fields being real or complex , should be in the ratio @xmath136 where the dimension is @xmath137 , or the spatial dimension is @xmath10 .",
    "+ the number of components - at least the number of real counted components - must of course be positive integer or zero .",
    "thus the minimal number of fermion components must be @xmath133 , while the number of boson components must be @xmath132 or the numbers must be an integer multiplum of these numbers .",
    "+ alone this theorem of ours  @xcite makes appreciable restriction for when bosonization / fermionization is at all possible .",
    "we are suggesting here the starting point with the bosonic degrees of freedom only , consisting of `` series of the kalb - ramond fields , all the chain through , except for one ( pseudo)scalar '' . by this",
    "we mean that we have as the bosons a series of separate fields @xmath138 with all the values of the number of indexes , antisymmetric with respect to all their indexes .",
    "+ there is a simple way in which one could get the number @xmath139 of boson components , if we arrange to have - by some gauge choice - only spatial values of the indexes @xmath16 , @xmath15 , ... on the a - fields , removing the @xmath140 field with zero indexes .",
    "the number of components become equal to the number of subsets of @xmath10 letters , which is @xmath133 . removing pure scalar",
    ", we get this number @xmath132 , as we want for the theorem of@xcite .",
    "4 .   from the @xmath132 bosons represented by the kalb - ramond fields ( with the scalar removed ) ,",
    "then according to the theorem  @xcite there must be the @xmath141 components of fermion fields .",
    "this means for the weyl spinor representation of fermion fields in even @xmath142 , with @xmath0 members that there are @xmath143 @xmath0 real fermion fields . to get @xmath141 real weyl spinor representation fermion fields",
    "there must be @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 families .",
    "5 .   from the bosonization requirement",
    "we obviously get out that there must exist an even number of families as it also comes out from the _ spin - charge - family _ theory of one of us ( n.s.m.b . )",
    "but now there is a correction due to the components of the kalb - ramond fields with time indices , that is with @xmath147 .",
    "this gives very interesting corrections as we may postpone till later .",
    "there is an interesting hope for that actually our at first free bosons being fermionized to free fermions could be generalized to have an universal coupling to a gravitational field - the bosonic field , which we do not fermionize , keeping it as gravitation , interactiing with the fermions - so that we finally arrive at a theory with several families of fermions and gravity .    in this contribution",
    "we wrote down a formula for counting the number of states for the fermion and the boson systems having the same number of fock states with given momentum and energy for the free massless case of our bosonization / fermionization procedure .",
    "we used in reality an infrared cut off that meant that we in fact considered a torus world with for different components different periodicity conditions : some components of fields had antiperiodicity while the others had periodicity property along various coordinate directions .",
    "the wave functions for the momentum eigenstates are as is well known all along taking on only pure phase factor values , i.e. they obey @xmath148 all along .",
    "the number of turns around zero , which they perform when one goes around the torus along the different coordinates , is an integer ( or a half integer depending on the boundary condition ) .",
    "we can consider this number of turns going around the torus in different ways ( along different coordinates ) a topological quantity in the sense that it as an integer can not change under a small deformation .",
    "our main idea is at this point that we in this way can introduce at least a not too strong gravitational field and still have single particle solutions to the equations of motion characterized by the same system of ( topological ) quantum numbers .",
    "that should suggest that we have the same set up for making the in this work studied bosonization in a not too strong gravitational field as in the free case .",
    "we namely should be able to classify the single particle states as functions of the space - time variables @xmath27 on the by gravitational fields deformed torus ( torus due to infra red cut off ) according to a topological classification in terms of the number of times the wave function encircles the value zero in the complex plane when the one follows a closed curve , following , say , the coordinates of the deformed torus .",
    "for the massless theory we have scale - invariance for the matter fields - the series of the kalb - ramond fields or the fermions - so , as long as we consider the gravitational field as a background field , i.e. we ignore the dynamics of the gravitational field itsef - we can scale up the momenta of the single particles by just letting the phase of an eigen - solution be scaled up by a factor .",
    "only the periodicity conditions will enforce such scalings to be by integer factors , just as they must be also in the free flat case .",
    "so we argue that with a background gravitational field , that is with a not too strong field , we have a possible description in terms of a discretized enumeration quite in the correspondence with the one for the flat case .    remembering that we obtained the bosonization w.r.t .",
    "state counting in fact class @xmath40 for class , meaning that the momentum eigenstates in the classes corresponding to rays went separately from boson to fermion or oppositely , we may have given arguments at least suggesting that a corresponding bosonization correspondence as the one in the free flat case also applies to the case with some ( may be not too large though ) gravitational field as a background field .",
    "since we now with our expansions in power series seek to guarantee that we shall make the bosonization or fermionizations just in such a way that the d - momentum will be the same for the fermion configuration and the boson configuration corresponding to each other , we might hope that we could formulate the exact correspondence and the interpretations in terms of fields with spin indexes so that indeed the momentum densities would be the same for the fermions and for the corresponding bosons .",
    "if we succeed in that then the action on the gravitational fields which only feel the matter via the energy momentum tensor @xmath149 would be the same for the bosons and the fermions in the corresponding states . in that case",
    "the development of the gravitational fields would be the same for the corresponding fermion and boson configurations .",
    "thus the bosonization / fermionization procedure would truly have been made also in the with gravity interacting models .",
