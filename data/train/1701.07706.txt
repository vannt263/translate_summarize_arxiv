    "the study of submanifolds with constant mean curvature , i.e. , @xmath4 submanifolds , and , in particular , that of @xmath4 surfaces in @xmath0-dimensional spaces , represents a very active research topic in differential geometry for more than @xmath7 years .",
    "there are several ways to generalize these submanifolds .",
    "for example , keeping the @xmath4 hypothesis and adding other geometric hypotheses to the submanifold or , by contrast , in the particular case of hypersurfaces in space forms , studying the hypersurfaces which are `` highly non-@xmath4 '' .",
    "the biconservative submanifolds seem to be an interesting generalization of @xmath4 submanifolds .",
    "biconservative submanifolds in arbitrary manifolds ( and in particular , biconservative surfaces ) which are also @xmath4 have some remarkable properties ( see , for example @xcite ) . @xmath4",
    "hypersurfaces in space forms are trivially biconservative , so more interesting is the study of biconservative hypersurfaces which are non-@xmath4 ; recent results in non-@xmath4 biconservative hypersurfaces were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the biconservative submanifolds are closely related to the biharmonic submanifolds .",
    "more precisely , let us consider the _ bienergy functional _",
    "defined for all smooth maps between two riemannian manifolds @xmath8 and @xmath9 and given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the tension field of @xmath12 . a critical point of @xmath13 is called a _ biharmonic map _ and is characterized by the vanishing of the _ bitension field _ @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a riemannian immersion @xmath15 or , simply , a submanifold @xmath16 of @xmath17 , is called _ biharmonic _ if @xmath12 is a biharmonic map .",
    "now , if @xmath18 is a fixed map , then @xmath13 can be thought as a functional defined on the set of all riemannian metrics on @xmath16 .",
    "this new functional s critical points are riemannian metrics determined by the vanishing of the _ stress - bienergy tensor _ @xmath19 .",
    "this tensor field satisfies @xmath20 if @xmath21 for a submanifold @xmath16 in @xmath17 , then @xmath16 is called a biconservative submanifold and it is characterized by the fact that the tangent part of its bitension field vanishes .",
    "thus we can expect that the class of biconservative submanifolds to be much larger that the class of biharmonic submanifolds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a section where we recall some notions and general results about biconservative submanifolds , we present in _",
    "section @xmath0 _ the local , intrinsic characterization of biconservative surfaces .",
    "the local , intrinsic characterization theorem provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for an abstract surface @xmath22 to admit , locally , a biconservative embedding with positive mean curvature function @xmath23 and @xmath24 at any point .",
    "our main goal is to extend the _",
    "classification results for biconservative surfaces in @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to _ global _ results , i.e. , we ask that biconservative surfaces to be _ complete _ , with @xmath25 everywhere and @xmath26 on an open dense subset .    in _",
    "section @xmath27 _ we consider the global problem and construct complete biconservative surfaces in @xmath5 with @xmath25 on @xmath16 and @xmath24 at any point of an open dense subset of @xmath16 .",
    "we determine such surfaces in two ways .",
    "one way is to use the local , extrinsic characterization of biconservative surfaces in @xmath5 and `` glue '' two pieces together in order to obtain a complete biconservative surface .",
    "the other way is more analytic and consists in using the local , intrinsic characterization theorem in order to obtain a biconservative immersion from @xmath28 in @xmath5 with @xmath25 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 on an open dense subset of @xmath29 ( the immersion has to be unique ) ; here , @xmath31 is a positive constant and therefore we obtain a one - parameter family of solutions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , by a simple transformation of the metric @xmath32 , @xmath33 is ( intrinsically ) isometric to a helicoid .    in the _ last section _ we consider the global problem of biconservative surfaces in @xmath6 with @xmath25 on @xmath16 and @xmath24 at any point of an open dense subset of @xmath16 .",
    "as in the @xmath5 case , we use the local , extrinsic classification of biconservative surfaces in @xmath6 , but now the `` gluing '' process is not as clear as in @xmath5 .",
    "further , we change the point of view and use the local , intrinsic characterization of biconservative surfaces in @xmath6 .",
    "we determine the complete riemannian surfaces @xmath34 which admit a biconservative immersion in @xmath6 with @xmath25 everywhere and @xmath26 on an open dense subset of @xmath29 and we show that , up to isometries , there exists only a one - parameter family of such riemannian surfaces indexed by @xmath35 .",
    "we end the paper with some figures , obtained for particular choices of the constants , which represent the non-@xmath4 complete biconservative surfaces in @xmath5 and the way how these surfaces can be obtained in @xmath6 .",
    "throughout this work , all manifolds , metrics , maps are assumed to be smooth , i.e. in the @xmath36 category , and we will often indicate the various riemannian metrics by the same symbol @xmath37 .",
    "all surfaces are assumed to be connected and oriented .",

    "when @xmath41 is the energy functional , p. baird and j. eells ( @xcite ) , and a. sanini ( @xcite ) , defined the tensor field @xmath44 and proved that @xmath45 thus , @xmath42 can be chosen as the stress - energy tensor of the energy functional .",

    "formula is very similar to the ricci condition .",
    "further , we will briefly recall the ricci problem . given an abstract surface @xmath22 , we want to find the conditions that have to be satisfied by @xmath16 such that , locally , it admits a minimal embedding in @xmath1 .",

    "we can see that relations @xmath200 and @xmath199 are very similar and , in @xcite , the authors studied the link between them .",
    "thus , for @xmath2 , it was proved that if we consider a surface @xmath22 which satisfies @xmath201 and @xmath202 , then there exists a very simple conformal transformation of the metric @xmath49 such that @xmath203 satisfies @xmath199 .",
    "a similar result was also proved for @xmath204 , but in this case , the conformal factor has a complicated expression ( and it is not enough to impose that @xmath22 satisfy , but we need the stronger hypothesis of it to admit a biconservative immersion in @xmath1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , condition @xmath201 does not imply , locally , the existence of a biconservative immersion in @xmath1 , as in the minimal case .",
    "we need a stronger condition .",
