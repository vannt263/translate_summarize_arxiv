    "recent decades have witnessed a great deal of research on qsl time both in closed @xcite and open systems @xcite . in particular , a qsl time based on the schatten @xmath1 norm for an arbitrarily driven open system was presented by deffner and lutz @xcite    @xmath2}{\\min \\left\\ { e_{1}^{\\tau } , e_{2}^{\\tau } , e_{\\infty } ^{\\tau } \\right\\ } } ,   \\label{qsl}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 denotes the bures angle between the initial state @xmath4 and the target state @xmath5 , which is governed by the time - dependent master equation @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is a superoperator ) .",
    "it is reasonable to employ the bures angle above as a measure for distance between an pure state and a mixed state , since the important riemannian feature is satisfied under such a circumstance @xcite .",
    "the denominator @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ qsl ] ) represents the average of @xmath9 over actual driving time duration @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "one important application of the qsl time is to evaluate the speed of quantum evolutions under the following two scenarios :    ( i ) .",
    "the fastest evolution appears when the actual driving time @xmath10 achieves the qsl time @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 for slower evolutions , @xmath14 and the slower the evolution , the higher ratio @xmath15 should be .",
    "this point of view is clear and unambiguous and has been widely utilized in the field of entanglement assisted speedup of quantum evolutions @xcite .",
    "( ii ) . from another point of view",
    ", @xmath16 indicates the evolution is already the fatest , and possesses no potential capacity for further acceleration , while for @xmath17 the higher ratio @xmath18 ( or equivalently , the much shorter @xmath12 ) , the greater the capacity for potential speedup will be .",
    "this viewpoint has been adopted in exploring the memory effect , characterized by non - markovianity @xcite , on the speed of quantum evolution qslopen3,xu1,xu2 .",
    "it is found that in the damped jaynes - cummings model of a single qubit , the transition from no potential capacity of speedup ( @xmath19 ) to potential speedup ( @xmath14 ) , or say a reduction of qsl in quantum evolution is just the critical point when the memoryless environment becomes of memory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if evolution of a  qubit is already along the qsl time which means its fastest speed in nature environment , the study on it will probably not so urgent as the case of @xmath14 which have speedup potential .",
    "although the memory effect of environment plays a decisive role in the potential acceleration of quantum evolution in a single qubit case , the question may arise whether it will still be true even in multi - qubit cases .",
    "this question is of particular interest , for the qsl time of multi - qubit open systems has now caught increasing attention and several interesting phenomena were discovered . for instances , with the qsl time defined in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , taddei _",
    "et al_. illustrated that the separable states of a multi - qubit system under markovian dephasing channels perform the same speedup of quantum evolution as the entangled states when the number of qubits is large enough .",
    "on the other hand , del campo _ et al . _ demonstrated , with the bound introduced in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , that multi - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states and separable states under markovian and non - markovian dephasing are equivalent in metrological parameter estimation @xcite . in this paper , mainly focused on scenario 2 , we show that for a class of multiqubit states memory effect is a requisite for raising potential ability of speeding up quantum evolution , while for another class of multi - qubit states , memoryless environment is ready to realize the above result .",
    "especially when the open system is initially prepared in product state @xmath20 a transition from no potential capacity for speedup to possess speedup ability is achieved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the qsl time for typical two - qubit , three - qubit , and n - qubit states , respectively .",
    "discussion on the role of entanglement in qsl time is performed in sec .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . iv .",
    "we consider n independent two - level atoms ( open system ) each locally coupling to a leaky vacuum cavity ( environment ) .",
    "the dynamics of the multi - qubit open system is fully determined by each pair of atom cavities @xcite with the following hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the resonant transition frequency of the atom between the excited state @xmath23 and the ground state @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the pauli raising and lowering operators . @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the frequency and the annihilation(creation ) operators of the @xmath28th mode of the cavity with @xmath29 the corresponding real coupling constant .",

    "( [ qsl3 - 3 ] ) , we consider a special case , i.e. , @xmath81 under the environment of no memory ( @xmath82 ) . therefore ,",
    "( qsl3 - 3 ) can be simplified as :    @xmath83    indicating that there also exists a sudden transition of speedup potential of quantum evolution even the environment is of no memory .",
    "in this subsection , we show that the above phenomena are ubiquitous in n - qubit cases ( n is an arbitrary positive integer ) .",
    "it is easy to check that if the n - qubit open system is initially prepared in state @xmath84 with @xmath85 the qsl ratio is exactly the same as eqs .",
    "( [ qsl2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ qsl3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the memory effect of environment becomes the essential condition for the speedup potential emerge in quantum evolution .",
    "however , if the initial state is in @xmath86 , the qsl ratio is given by    @xmath87    in particular when the environment is memoryless , i.e. , @xmath88 eq .",
