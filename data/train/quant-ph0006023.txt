    "recent development of quantum - state reconstruction methods has made it possible to completely reconstruct an unknown state of a quantum mechanical system provided that many identical copies of the state are available .",
    "the method was pioneered in quantum optics , where an optical homodyne tomography was devised to reconstruct a quantum state of traveling electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "other proposed techniques involved unbalanced homodyning @xcite and cavity - field measurements by atomic probes @xcite .",
    "quantum - state reconstruction procedures were also successfully applied to molecular vibrational state @xcite and motional quantum state of trapped ion @xcite .",
    "single - mode optical homodyne tomography is now a well - established technique .",
    "based on balanced homodyne detection , the method seeks to reconstruct the quantum state from the statistics of the quadrature components of the signal mode .",
    "the standard experimental setup involves balanced lossless beam splitter , where the signal is mixed with a strong coherent local oscillator ( lo ) .",
    "two photodetectors are placed at the beam splitter outputs and the two photocurrents are subtracted , thereby removing lo fluctuations from the resulting signal",
    ".    wigner function can be obtained from the measured quadrature statistics by means of inverse radon transform @xcite .",
    "once the wigner function is known , expectation value of any operator can be be evaluated by averaging corresponding phase - space function over the wigner quasidistribution .",
    "this strategy , however , is not optimal , because the experimental errors are amplified during numerical data processing and the final error can be very large . fortunately , the detour via wigner function can be avoided and density matrix elements in fock basis can be directly reconstructed by averaging appropriate sampling functions over the measured quadrature statistics .",
    "the functions for sampling @xmath0-ordered moments were found in @xcite , and those allowing direct reconstruction of the exponential moments of quantum phase distributions were obtained in @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the problems with inverse radon transform can be avoided by reconstructing smoothed wigner functions @xcite .",
    "the sampling is a simple and straightforward linear operation which can be in principle performed in real time during experiment .",
    "we note that , besides linear sampling procedures , reconstruction strategies based on maximum likelihood estimation @xcite and maximum entropy principle @xcite have been proposed .    recently , increasing attention has been devoted to multimode homodyne tomography @xcite , because some of the most interesting quantum mechanical phenomena stem from correlations between several degrees of freedom .",
    "let us mention just the epr paradox and violation of bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "quantized electromagnetic field is one of the most suitable systems for thorough investigation and exploitation of these phenomena .",
    "for example , entangled signal and idler photons can be routinely prepared by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "the entangled photon pairs play crucial role in certain quantum state teleportation schemes @xcite and quantum cryptography setups @xcite .",
    "multimode extension of optical homodyne tomography is straightforward .",
    "one can introduce a separate lo and homodyne detector for each mode of interest and measure joint multimode quadrature distribution . in this case",
    "the sampling functions developed for single - mode tomography can be immediately employed .",
    "very recently , this approach has been used to measure the joint photon number statistics of two - mode squeezed state prepared in a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "however , the requirement of specific homodyne detector for each mode complicates the experiment",
    ". it would often be much more feasible to use only one homodyne detector and one lo .",
    "in such experiment , a distribution of one quadrature @xmath3 , which is a linear superposition of @xmath4 single - mode quadratures , is measured .",
    "the knowledge of the probability distribution of all distinct quadratures @xmath3 provides a complete information on the multimode quantum state .",
    "in particular , two - mode tomography with single homodyne detector was discussed extensively .",
    "the functions for sampling density matrix elements in fock basis were found in @xcite , and those allowing direct reconstruction of two - mode correlation functions were obtained in @xcite .",
    "recently , a general multimode homodyne tomography with a single lo was considered and the sampling functions for density matrix elements were expressed in terms of integrals @xcite . in this paper we shall derive various important sampling functions for multimode homodyne tomography with a single lo .",
    "all functions are expressed in analytical form .",

    "the reconstructed @xmath1-function exhibits gaussian shape characteristic for squeezed states . the squeezing is clearly reflected in the elliptic shape of the @xmath1-function , as can be seen in the contour plot in fig .",
    "the reconstruction error can be judged from fig .",
    "6(c ) , which depicts the difference @xmath216 between exact and reconstructed @xmath1-functions .",
    "the error is acceptably small and the reconstruction can be considered successful .",
    "let us now proceed to sampling the multimode moments .",
    "again , we have assumed @xmath213 .",
    "we have employed the loss - compensating sampling kernels ( [ dlossnormal ] ) and the analytical functions @xmath148 given by eq . ( [ fort ] ) .",
    "we have sampled at @xmath207 different values of each angle @xmath217 and phase @xmath218 , @xmath219 . at each point",
    "@xmath167 @xmath220 values of the quadrature @xmath3 were recorded , which represents altogether @xmath221 data .",
    "the reconstructed normally ordered moments @xmath222 and @xmath223 can be seen in fig .",
    "the gray bars display the exact values and allow for comparison with the sampled moments .",
    "the reconstructed moments are in very good agreement with the exact values .",
    "the sampling error increases with the moment order and it is higher for @xmath223 than for the factorial moments @xmath224 .",
    "while @xmath225 is still reconstructed with high accuracy , @xmath226 is sampled with certain error .",
    "this can be explained by the necessity of sampling a high fourier component @xmath227 in order to reconstruct @xmath226 . when we tried to sample moments of @xmath207th or higher orders , the results suffered from very large systematic errors because we violated the conditions ( [ mnvarphi ] ) and ( [ mntheta ] ) .",
    "the moments @xmath228 contain information on the photon - number statistics of the mode @xmath12 . from the sampled moments we can determine the mandel @xmath1-parameter for @xmath229th mode ,",
    "@xmath230 this parameter allows one to quickly distinguish between super - poissonian ( @xmath231 ) and sub - poissonian ( @xmath232 ) photon - number statistics . from the data shown in fig .",
    "8 we have @xmath233 and we find that the light in the mode @xmath12 exhibits super - poissonian photon number statistics .",
    "the moments of the modes @xmath13 and @xmath234 are the same as those of mode @xmath12 because the squeezed vacuum @xmath198 is equally split among the three modes @xmath7 , c.f .",
    "( [ abtransform ] ) .",
    "the sampling works equally well for the modes @xmath13 and @xmath234 and the results are very similar to those displayed in fig .",
    "7 .    having verified the feasibility of reconstruction of the single - mode moments we have finally sampled the multimode moments .",
    "several results are shown in fig .",
    "again , the low - order moments are reproduced with high accuracy , and the error increases with the moment order .",
    "it is worth noting that the photon number correlations @xmath235 can be sampled from phase averaged data .",
    "this is important from the experimental point of view , because the sampling of moments ( [ ncorr ] ) does not require stable relative phase between the local oscillator and signal modes .",
    "all phases @xmath34 can be fully randomized , e.g. , by means of randomly driven piezoelectric modulators , and the homodyning then yields phase - averaged quadrature statistics @xcite .",
    "in addition to the squeezed - vacuum state discussed here , we have also considered other quantum states , such as multimode coherent states and multimode squeezed coherent states . in all cases ,",
    "the reconstruction procedure worked well .",
    "the numerical simulations clearly demonstrate the feasibility of three - mode homodyne tomography from @xmath236 recorded data .",
    "of course , the number of necessary data inevitably increases with the number of modes .",
    "we have derived various important sampling functions for multimode homodyne tomography with a single local oscillator . starting from the relation between multimode characteristic function and measured quadrature distribution",
    "we have found sampling functions for the @xmath0-parametrized quasidistributions with @xmath237 .",
    "we have proved that the sampling function for husimi quasidistribution is a generating function of the sampling functions @xmath86 for density matrix elements in fock basis @xmath72 .",
    "the functions @xmath86 were expressed as finite series of confluent hypergeometric functions . finally , we have found the functions allowing for direct reconstruction of multimode @xmath0-ordered moments from the homodyne data . in all cases , loss - compensating sampling functions , applicable to a realistic experiment with detection efficiency @xmath158 ,",
    "have been provided . in order to test performance of the sampling functions we simulated homodyne detection of squeezed three - mode state and reconstructed the three - mode @xmath1-function and several normally ordered moments .",
    "the reconstruction has shown very good results for a detection efficiency @xmath213 and @xmath238 sampled data , which is experimentally feasible .",
    "we emphasize that the multimode quantum state is reconstructed from the statistics of a class of single - mode quadratures .",
    "only one homodyne detector is needed , which substantially simplifies the experiment .",
    "this method is particularly suitable for the measurement of ultrafast internal correlations of optical pulses or for the reconstruction of the quantum state of multimode single - frequency optical field .",
