    "till date , the burst data analysis in the narrow - band resonant detectors like explorer - nautilus is based on the assumption that short gravitational wave(gw ) bursts ( duration of few millisecond to fraction of a second ) appear as delta - like signals in the detector bandwidth ( bw ) .",
    "such an assumption was made mainly because the short gw bursts emit waveforms of unknown shape and further due to detector s narrow band , one could safely assume that the signal emits a flat spectrum in the detector bw .",
    "however , recent improvements in resonant bar detectors , mainly the read - out with new transducers and high coupling dc - squid @xcite , have improved the bw ( @xmath0 hz ) at the sensitivity level of @xmath1 , see fig [ fig : exp](a ) .",
    "thus , it is important to reassess the above assumption which we demonstrate in this paper with an example of stellar quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) .",
    "astrophysical inputs indicate @xcite that various physical processes can excite stellar qnm during its evolutionary phases , emitting gw in the bw of the resonant bars .",
    "such gw may last for a fraction of a second to few seconds .",
    "for example , after the sn core collapse , during the cooling phase , the proto - ns emits gw as a damped sinusoid signal evolving in frequency as well as damping time and can also chirp in the resonant bars @xcite . in this case , if the data is filtered through a filter matched to a delta - like signal  a delta filter  rather than a proper matched filter , the error in arrival timing as well as loss in snr can arise . here , as a preliminary study",
    ", we discuss these issues for a simple case of stellar qnm emitting gw @xmath2 modeled as a damped sinusoid with a fixed frequency @xmath3 and damping time @xmath4 , as given below [ ht ] h(t ) = h_0  e^-(t - t_0)/  ( t - t_0 ) . here",
    ", @xmath5 implies @xmath6 for @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the time of arrival ) and zero otherwise .",
    "the damping time @xmath4 depends on the underlying physical process .    to carry out the delta filter assessment",
    ", we assume the signal parameters @xmath9 and @xmath4 are known and compare the outputs of the delta filter to that of the matched filter .",
    "the incoming @xmath2 can excite the first longitudinal mode of the resonant bar .",
    "a low mass electrical transducer is attached to the bar to convert this displacement of the bar end face into an electrical signal which is further amplified with the squid amplifier .",
    "such a bar - transducer system is modeled as a coupled harmonic oscillator with two resonant modes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 provides an external force @xmath10 to the bar [ @xmath11 : the reduced mass of the system @xmath12 , @xmath13 : the effective length @xmath14 .",
    "the electrical output of the transducer is proportional to the relative displacements of the transducer and the bar , @xmath15 from their equilibrium positions . in fourier domain @xcite",
    ", the response @xmath16 to the external force @xmath17 is obtained by [ uom ] u(j ) = w_ux(j ) f_x(j ) , where @xmath18 is the system transfer function from the input force to the output displacement as given defined in eq.(1.8 ) of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 [ the ft of @xmath17 ] for @xmath2 defined in eq .  (",

    "the relative displacement of the transducer @xmath16 is in units of length .",
    "the electrical signal at the output of the squid amplifier is then given by [ eq : vt ] v(t ) = k u(t ) m_v u_0(t ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the maximum value of @xmath16 .",

    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the system transfer functions as defined in @xcite .",

    "the variance of the filtered noise is given by ( < n , q > ) = e\\{<n , q>^2 } - ( e \\{<n , q>})^2 = n_u .",

    "as stated earlier , the delta - filtering is the most natural approach for detecting unknown short gw bursts in the narrow - band detector .",
    "the delta filters are developed as follows .",
    "the normalized system response to a delta - like signal ( used to build the delta - filter ) is @xmath53 such that @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 = 1 $ ] .",
    "then , the delta filter , constructed from this response has the transfer function @xmath56 with the filter normalization @xmath57^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this filter construction is such that if an impulse is incident on the bar with @xmath58 then the maximum of the filtered output @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "however , when the response of the detector to the damped sinusoid is filtered through the delta filter , the filtered output becomes [ eq : gdelta ] o(t ) & = & < v , q^",
    "> = _ -^ ( j t ) d , + & = & _ -^ .",
    "we solve this integration by applying the residue theorem and obtain [ eq : gt2 ] & o(t ) & = .",
    "the variance of the filtered noise is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , [ eq : snrd ] snr_^2 = ( max < u_0,q^>)^2 .",
    "to illustrate , we use the parameters pertaining to explorer[feb 2005 ] ; two resonant frequencies @xmath62 hz , @xmath63 hz , @xmath64 ms , @xmath65 ms , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the output of the delta filter is shown in fig.[fig : filt ] b. the output is asymmetric about @xmath68 as the delta filter is causal [ as it is not properly matched ] unlike the matched filter .",
    "mathematically , it can be seen by the the relative sign difference between the signal term and the two resonances in eq.([eq : gt2 ] ) . in this case , the filtered output becomes maximum when @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the arrival timing error is proportional to @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : snra ] ( c ) .",
    "the steps correspond to the beating frequency which in general depends on @xmath9 and @xmath49 . in this case when @xmath70 , it is @xmath71 hz .",
    "we note that this beating is crucial while fixing the coincidence timing window while performing coincidences between say explorer - nautilus or explorer - virgo .    in case",
    "( b ) , when @xmath9 is far away from fb , the situation is contrary .",
    "in this case , the timing error is small , [ see fig . [",
    "fig : snra ] ( c ) ] . as explained earlier , for @xmath9 away from fb and low @xmath4 , the signal acts as a delta - like signal . as a result ,",
    "delta - filter itself is a matched filter hence gives no timing error .",
    "mathematically , the signal term in eq.([eq : gt2 ] ) is small compared to other terms .",
    "in this work , we did a comparative study of the response of the matched filter _ vs _ delta - filters for filtering the damped sinusoids gw signals for resonant bar detectors .",
    "we divided our study in two cases : ( a ) @xmath72 and ( b ) @xmath9 far from the fb with @xmath73 using explorer configuration .",
    "we find that in case ( a ) , the loss in snr increases as @xmath4 and so does the arrival timing error if delta - filter is used instead of matched filter .",
    "however , in case ( b ) , the signal almost acts like a delta for small @xmath4 hence the snr loss is negligible for small @xmath74 however as @xmath4 increases , the snr loss gradually increases .",
    "the arrival timing error is minimal for all @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we can optimally use delta filters for detecting signals in case ( b ) for @xmath74 as large as @xmath75 ms .",
    "but , to detect damped sinusoids in case ( a ) with @xmath4 as large as @xmath76 ms , it is mandatory to use the optimal filtering as opposed to delta - filter .",
    "this poses a problem of setting an `` optimal '' grid of templates in @xmath77 when @xmath77 are fixed .",
    "however , as described earlier , @xmath9 and @xmath4 can evolve in the detector bandwidth . for detecting such signals and perform coincidences ,",
    "the delta filter is inadequate and an optimal `` matched '' filter is difficult to construct due to insufficient knowledge of signal waveform .",
    "alternative detection methods are needed which we pursue in future work ."
