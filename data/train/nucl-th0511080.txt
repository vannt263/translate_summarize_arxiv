    "no scale is involved in this drastic situation and the momentum space faddeev equations are scale invariant for vanishing two and three - body energies .",
    "the scale invariance is broken by finite values of two - body scattering lengths and three - body binding energy , which are the scales of the corresponding three - body systems  @xcite .",

    "( [ trimer ] ) has a weaker strength for @xmath32 ( virtual two - body system ) than for @xmath33 ( bound two - body system ) .",
    "therefore , for a borromean trimer eq .",
    "( [ trimer ] ) should have a larger value of @xmath34 than the corresponding one for an all - bound system , in order to keep the binding fixed with a weaker interaction .",
    "the spectator function , @xmath35 , extends to large momentum for a borromean system .",
    "the trimer wave function for zero total angular momentum is @xmath36 which implies in a more compact spatial configuration for a borromean trimer in comparison to the all - bound one .",
    "the jacobi relative momenta are @xmath37 for the pair and @xmath38 for the spectator particle . in terms of the scaling functions the radii come as , @xmath39 and the separation distances obeys @xmath40 , where the labels @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to borromean and all - bound systems , respectively .",
    "for the same reasons that led to eq .",
    "( [ ragt ] ) , it is also valid that latexmath:[$\\sqrt{\\langle r^2_{\\alpha}\\rangle    zero - range model applied to atomic @xmath2he@xmath3 provides a qualitative understanding of the radii results of realistic calculations for the ground and excited states  @xcite with an estimation of @xmath44}$ ] with @xmath45  @xcite . also the excited trimer state energy of @xmath2he@xmath3 , @xmath46 , has a scaling behavior written as @xmath47 which is consistent with results from realistic calculations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the threshold for the appearance of an excited efimov trimer state from the second energy sheet is @xmath48",
    "@xcite in units of ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the scaling behavior was extended to the complex energy plane and for three - boson borromean systems , the excited efimov state turns into a resonance when the virtual two - boson virtual state energy is decreased  @xcite .    the generalization of the reasonings leading to eq .",
    "( [ ragt ] ) to the @xmath50 system gives the qualitative classification of the different three - body systems in respect to sizes .",
    "the effective interaction is weaker when a pair has a virtual state than when the pair is bound , and the three - body system has to shrink to keep the binding energy unchanged if a pair which is bound turns to be virtual",
    ". therefore it is reasonable to expect that @xmath51 which was checked numerically  @xcite .",
    "an analogous relation is valid for @xmath52 .",
    "the dimensionless products ( we are using units of @xmath49 ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 increase from _ borromean _ , _ tango _ , _ samba _ and to _ all - bound _ configurations , systematizing the classification scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for weakly bound three - body systems .",
    "a three - body model applied to light exotic nuclei  @xcite compares qualitatively well with the existent experimental data for the neutron - neutron separation distance in the neutron - halo of @xmath0li and @xmath1be  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the neutrons of the halo have a large probability to be found outside the interaction range and the low - energy properties of the halo are , to a large extend , universal as long as few physical input scales are fixed in the model . an insight into the structure of halo nuclei can be found even considering the limitations of the model .",
    "the finite size of the core and consequently the antisymmetrization of the total nuclear wave function , are both missing in this simplified description .",
    "however , in examples where the neutrons in the halo tend to be more and more weakly bound with virtual or bound subsystems near the scattering threshold , the scaling relations apply for the halo properties , as the above limitations are less important .",
    "the four - boson system has two faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) independent amplitudes and within a zero - range model , they are reduced to spectator amplitudes depending on two jacobi momenta .",
    "the two spectator fy reduced amplitudes satisfy a coupled set of integral equations generalizing the sktm equation for three bosons .",
    "the set of coupled integral equations needs regularization , and one recognizes that the resolvent of the immersed three - boson subsystem carries the scale @xmath12 .",
    "other terms are present and require regularization .",
    "we introduce a scale @xmath55 such that the four - body free green s function @xmath56 are substituted by @xmath57  @xcite in a direct generalization of eq .",
    "( [ trimer ] ) as suggested by  @xcite .",
    "the momentum scales in the fy equations for the reduced amplitudes are only @xmath58 , @xmath12 and @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the tetramer binding energy depends on the momentum scales as @xmath59 for @xmath60 the trimer binding energy from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ trimer ] ) is @xmath61  @xcite , which simplifies eq .",
    "( [ sca4b ] ) remaining only the dependence on the ratio @xmath62 in @xmath63 : @xmath64 if @xmath65 is independent on the regularization scale @xmath55 for @xmath66 the four - body scale is not important .",
    "we solved numerically the fy equations up to large values of @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the tetramer ground state binding energy was calculated for different values of the ratio @xmath62 with @xmath60 .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 depends strongly @xmath62 . for equal three and four - body scales ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath69 , the tetramer binding energy is @xmath70 , agreeing with the angular coefficient of the tjon line  @xcite , @xmath71  mev ( @xmath63 is the @xmath2he energy and @xmath4 the triton one ) .",
    "also , a recent calculation  @xcite of the four - boson system with a two - body zero - range force and a repulsive three - body potential to stabilize the trimer against collapse , @xmath63 scales as @xmath72 .",
    "our result for @xmath73 agrees with both .",
    "however , for @xmath74 we found that the ratio between the tetramer and trimer energies is about 78 , indicating the independent effect of the four - body scale .",
    "the present results suggest that the general scaling of s - wave three - boson observables with the physical scales , eq .",
    "( [ obs3 ] ) , may be generalized to four - boson s - wave observables .",
    "the effect of the short - range dynamics in an observable comes through the values of the scattering length , trimer and tetramer binding energies , associated with @xmath12 and @xmath55 , respectively . in this case",
    ", a s - wave four - boson observable will be strongly correlated to @xmath75 , @xmath4 and @xmath63 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents either a scattering amplitude at energy @xmath19 , or an excited tetramer energy or some observable related to the tetramer ( the dependence on @xmath19 does not appear in these cases ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath20 gives the correct dimension to @xmath77 .",
    "for sizes one could think that the relation @xmath78 and the analogous for the distances of the particles to the center of mass would be valid .",
    "this indicates that is possible to envisage a generalized classification scheme based on sizes including weakly - bound four - body systems .",
    "the classification scheme of large halos formed by two identical particles and a core is reviewed and addressed systematically according to their sizes .",
    "the root - mean - square distances between the constituents are described by universal scaling functions . for a given three - body system and total energy ,",
    "the borromean configuration is the most compact .",
    "applications to halo nuclei , @xmath0li and @xmath1be , and for atomic @xmath2he@xmath3 were briefly discussed .",
    "the generalization of these concepts to four - body systems is proposed .",
    "we have shown that for a zero - range two - body interaction with an infinite scattering length and a fixed trimer ground state binding energy , a four boson momentum scale is evidenced in the calculation of tetramer binding energies in three - dimensions .",
    "the intensity of the effective interaction that composes the kernel of the reduced fy spectator equations depends on the dimer energy and trimer , therefore it is reasonable that a tetramer becomes more compact for a given four - body energy if the two and three - body binding are decreased .",
    "this effect indicates that it may be possible to generalize the classification scheme of weakly - bound three - body systems to four - body systems .",
