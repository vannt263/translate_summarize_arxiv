    "linear lepton colliders will provide the possibility to investigate photon collisions at energies and luminosities close to those in @xmath3 collisions @xcite .",
    "if a light higgs exists one of the main tasks of a photon collider will be the measurement of the partial width @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "not to be limited by the error from the luminosity determination the luminosity of the collider at the energy of the higgs mass has to be known with a precision of around 1% . to produce scalar higgses",
    "the total angular momentum of the two photons has to be @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the cross section @xmath0 is suppressed by a factor @xmath5 and thus not usable for luminosity determination .",
    "the radiative process @xmath6 is suppressed by an additional factor @xmath7 , however due to the additional final state photon the spin suppression does no longer apply .",
    "it is therefore worth examining if the radiative process can be used for luminosity determination .",
    "for this reason we consider the exclusive reaction @xmath8 as a possible candidate for a calibration channel at a photon collider .",
    "the two helicity configurations of the @xmath9-system lead to different spectra of the final state particles .",
    "we have analysed the behaviour of the @xmath10 reaction for the various helicities of the beam as a function of different observables .",
    "since the photon beams in the collider are only partially polarised the ratio of the cross sections of @xmath11 scattering for @xmath12 to @xmath13-beams should be high for the luminosity measurement .",
    "the main emphasis of this analysis is put on @xmath14 , which is about the mass , where a light higgs boson is expected .",
    "we consider the process @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are photon and fermion helicities .",
    "the centre of mass energy squared is denoted by @xmath19 and the final - state photon energy by @xmath20 . for the differential cross - section",
    "we introduce the normalised final - state photon energy ( c.m.s .",
