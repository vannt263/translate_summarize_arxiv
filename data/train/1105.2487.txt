    "another component is commonly detected in the nuclear spectra of seyfert galaxies : unresolved hot dust emission @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the contribution of the sps and other components to the circumnuclear continuum of active galaxies is a fundamental key in the understanding of the nature of their central engine .",
    "very recently , the use of integral field spectroscopy with adaptive optics at the gemini north telescope has allowed us to derive the contribution of distinct spcs to the nir spectra of active galaxies .",
    "in addition , we have mapped spcs spatial distributions and performed the first two - dimensional ( 2d ) sp synthesis in the nir of the nuclear region of an active galaxy ( mrk1066 , * ? ? ? * ) . a spatial correlation between the intermediate age spc and a partial ring of low stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath2 ) was found , supporting the interpretation that the low-@xmath2 structures commonly observed in the inner few hundreds parsecs of seyfert galaxies are due to colder regions with more recent star formation than the underlying bulge @xcite . using a different method  modelling the  equivalent width , supernova rate and mass - to - light ratio  @xcite have quantified the star formation history in the centre of 9 nearby seyfert galaxies using their stars code .",
    "they found that the ages of the stars which contribute most to the nir continuum lie in the range 1030myr , pointing out that these ages should be considered only as  characteristic \" , as they have not performed a proper spectral synthesis , suggesting that there may be simultaneously two or more sps that are not coeval @xcite .",
    "as part of an ongoing project aimed at mapping the 2d age distribution of the nir sp in the inner few hundred parsecs of seyfert galaxies , we present the nir sp synthesis of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk1157 ( ngc591 ) , an early type barred spiral galaxy located at a distance @xmath3mpc ( from nasa / ipac extragalactic database , ned ) , for which 1  corresponds to 296pc at the galaxy .",
    "the near - ir gas excitation and kinematics as well as the stellar kinematics of the inner 450 pc of mrk1157 are discussed in riffel & storchi - bergmann ( _ in prep . _ ) using the same data used here .",

    "mrk1157 was observed with gemini nifs @xcite operating with the gemini north adaptive optics system altair in september / october 2009 under the programme gn-2009b - q-27 , following the standard object - sky - sky - object dither sequence , with off - source sky positions since the target is extended , and individual exposure times of 550s .",
    "two sets of observations with six on - source individual exposures were obtained at different spectral ranges : the first at the j - band , centred at 1.25@xmath4 m and covering the spectral region from 1.14@xmath4 m to 1.36@xmath4 m , and the second at the k@xmath5-band , centred at 2.3@xmath4 m , covering the spectral range from 2.10@xmath6 m to 2.53@xmath6 m . at the j - band ,",
    "the j_g5603 grating and zj_g0601 filter were used , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath7 , as obtained from the measurement of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of arxe arc lamp lines .",
    "the k@xmath5-band observations were obtained using the kl_g5607 grating and hk_g0603 filter and resulted in a spectral resolution of fwhm@xmath8 .",
    "the data reduction was accomplished using tasks contained in the nifs package which is part of gemini iraf package , as well as generic iraf tasks .",
    "the reduction procedure included trimming of the images , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength and s - distortion calibrations .",
    "we have also removed the telluric bands and flux calibrated the frames by interpolating a black body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard star .",
    "the angular resolution obtained from the fwhm of the spatial profile of the telluric standard star is 011@xmath9002 for the j - band and 012@xmath9002 for the k@xmath5-band , corresponding to 32.6@xmath95.9 and 35.5@xmath95.9pc at the galaxy , respectively .",
    "since the star has been observed for a shorter time than the galaxy , this value should be considered as a lower limit for the spatial resolution .",
    "nevertheless , the performance of altair for larger integration times ( such those used for the galaxy ) in previous works by our group was found to be similar to the one reached in the observation of the star . in the case of ngc4151 ,",
    "the spatial resolution of the galaxy is only 002 worse than those obtained from the fwhm of the brightness profile of the star @xcite . for each band ,",
    "individual datacubes were created at an angular sampling of 005@xmath10005 and combined to a single datacube using the gemcombine iraf task .",
    "more details about observations and data reduction can be found in riffel & storchi - bergmann ( _ in prep . _ ) .      because of the complexity of the instruments , hyperspectral data frequently contains instrumental signatures that can not be removed with standard data reduction techniques , and which in many cases contaminates the science data .",
    "the gemini nifs is no exception .",
    "the wavelet principal component analysis ( wpca ) technique described below ( a full account of the technique will be addressed in a paper in preparation - ferrari et al .",
    "2011 ) can separate the instrumental fingerprint and , after its removal , allow the analysis of the  clean \" data .",
    "besides the relevant information , any set of data has some amount of redundant information and noise .",
    "the goal of principal component analysis ( pca ) is to find a new basis on which the data  the spectra from each spatial pixel - is expressed in a more meaningful way .",
    "the basis vectors  * the principal components *  are obtained by searching for the maximum variance in the data .",
    "there are as many vectors as the original variables , but usually the first few vectors contain most of the information of the data set : they provide a more concise description of the data .",
    "often the physical content is restricted to few vectors and thus interpretation can be easier .",
    "mathematically we proceed as follows . in a basis where the variables are all uncorrelated ( orthogonal )",
    "their covariance or correlation matrix is diagonal .",
    "we then find the principal components by diagonalizing the covariance or correlation matrix of the original data . in the case of covariance matrix , the * eigenvectors",
    "* are the principal components and the * eigenvalues * are the variance associated with each of the eigenvectors . in the case of a hyperspectral cube , it is informative to measure the correlation between each principal component and the spectra in each spatial pixel : the * tomograms*. for example , tomogram 1 is the projection ( scalar product ) of eigenvector 1 and the spectra relative to each spatial pixel . for a full description on the method applied to astronomical data ,",
    "see @xcite .      the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt )",
    "consists of describing a signal @xmath11 in terms of a smoothed component @xmath12 and detail wavelet coefficients @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath14 the maximum wavelet scale is @xmath15 . in the _  trous _",
    "( i.e. with holes ) algorithm @xcite used in this work , a series of smoothed versions @xmath16 of @xmath11 are calculated by convolving @xmath11 with scaled versions of a low - pass filter @xmath17 . in this way",
    ", the term @xmath18 is calculated by taking adjacent pixels from @xmath19 that are @xmath20 pixels far apart .",
    "we proceed in this way for each of the scale @xmath21 . after this",
    ", the discrete wavelet transform is obtained from the difference @xmath22 the wavelet coefficients @xmath13 now retain only details which are about @xmath20 in size , a multiresolution transform .",
    "the maximum scale @xmath15 is mathematically arbitrary because , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwt ] ) and ( [ eq : wdiff ] ) , reconstruction is complete for any @xmath15 .",
    "physically , @xmath15 is chosen so that the spatial frequencies of interest are lower than @xmath23 .",
    "the idea behind the use of the wavelet and the pca transforms together is to decompose the original signal both in the wavelet and in the pca space , select unwanted features and finally reconstruct the signal after eliminating these features .",
    "the algorithm is schematically shown in figure [ fig : wpca ] .",
    "the original datacube ( orange ) is first decomposed in wavelets scales @xmath24 .",
    "then , the pca analysis is performed in each of the wavelet components , resulting in several eigenvectors for each scale . after removing those eigenvectors which contain unwanted structures ( represented by black dots in the figure ) , each of the wavelets components is restored with the pca reconstruction , @xmath25 , and then the resulting corrected wavelets @xmath26 are combined to form the resulting corrected cube ( green ) .    )",
    "space and then the pca analysis is performed . after identifying and correcting for unwanted effects ( instrumental signatures , fingerprints or noise , for example ) the cube is reconstructed in both pca and wavelet spaces . ]",
    "figure  [ pcangc591 ] shows an example of the wpca transform of mrk1157 datacube .",
    "the columns are the wavelet decomposition of the original cube . in both fig.[fig : wpca ] and [ pcangc591 ] the dotted rectangle represents the same kind of information : in each wavelet scale a pca analysis is performed .",
    "the original information is completely represented in the wavelet space , thus summing up all the components gives back the original data .",
    "the wpca cleaning process is basically to identify the components ( in wavelet and pca space ) which contains mostly instrumental signatures ( i.e noise ) , then remove them and reconstruct the signal .        in the case of mrk1157 observations ,",
    "the wpca decomposition reveals that the @xmath27 tomograms are dominated by the instrumental signature ( horizontal and vertical stripes in fig .",
    "[ pcangc591 ] ) . that instrumental fingerprint can also be identified in the eigenvectors as high frequency bumps ( not shown ) in the beginning and in the end of the spectra ",
    "the instrumental signature has a spatial and spectral behaviour .",
    "thus , we remove @xmath27 and reconstruct the cube with @xmath28 .",
    "we call the attention to the fact that we have analysed 5 wavelet scales and 20 principal componentes ( with 20 eigenvectors and 20 tomograms ; a total of 200 maps ) to identify the instrumental signature . for sake of brevity , in fig .",
    "[ pcangc591 ] we only show the first 4 principal components , which account for @xmath2995% of the data variance .    the _ clean _ datacube was used to perform the stellar population analysis .",
    "the spatial resolution of the j and k@xmath30 bands are very similar , allowing us to combine both datacubes into a single datacube and then perform the spectral synthesis .",
    "the combination was done using the _ scombine _ iraf task at a spectral sampling of 2 .",
    "the astrometry was done using the peak of the continuum emission in both bands .",
    "we have re - binned the resulting datacube to a spatial sampling of 01 in order to reach a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) high enough to obtain a reliable fit of the stellar population .",
    "the resulting s / n ranges from @xmath31 at the borders of the nifs field to up to 120 at the nucleus .",
    "we used the _ wspectext _ iraf task to convert the individual spectra of the final datacube to 784 _ ascii _ files , used as input to the synthesis code .",
    "the observation field is 28@xmath1028 , which corresponds to 830@xmath10830 pc@xmath32 at the galaxy .",
    "our main goal in this section is to map in detail the nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) components of the inner 400 pc of mrk1157 . for this purpose",
    "we fit simultaneously the underlying continuum of the @xmath15 and @xmath33 bands applying the method described in @xcite and summarized below .    in order to perform the stellar population synthesis we use the  code @xcite .",
    "fits the whole underlying spectrum , excluding emission lines and spurious data , mixing computational techniques originally developed for semi empirical population synthesis with ingredients from evolutionary synthesis models @xcite .",
    "essentially , the code fits an observed spectrum , @xmath34 , with a combination , in different proportions , of @xmath35 single stellar populations ( ssps ) .",
    "extinction is parametrised by the v - band extinction @xmath36 and modelled by  as due to foreground dust . in the fits we use the ccm @xcite extinction law . in order to model a spectrum @xmath37",
    ", the code solves the following equation :    @xmath38    where * x * is the population vector , whose components @xmath39 , ( j = 1, .. ,n@xmath40 ) represent the fractional contribution of each ssp in the base to the total synthetic flux at @xmath41 .",

    "however , note that due to the low spectral resolution of eps models in the nir , the @xmath49 values can not be derived in a reliable way from the synthesis , thus , we do not use them . for details on @xmath49",

    "[ pop1 ] , we show the spatial distribution of the percent flux contribution at 2.12@xmath4 m of the stars in each @xmath68 : while in regions farther than r@xmath69 0.8(240pc ) from the nucleus the contribution of the young - intermediate spcs reaches values of up to 100% , closer to the nucleus the contribution of this component is negligible . within this region",
    "the stellar population is dominated by the old component(@xmath150% ) , closely surrounded ( r @xmath70 04 ) by an intermediate - old population ( also @xmath150% ) .",
    "no signs of young stellar populations were detected close to the nucleus ; however , a significant contribution ( 25 - 60% ) is found in regions farther than @xmath7106 .",
    "the light - fraction spc contributions depend of the normalization wavelength and thus the comparison with results from other spectral regions should be done with caution @xcite . however , a physical parameter which does not depend on the normalization point used in the fit is the stellar mass .",

    "the highest values of @xmath76 ( we used @xmath77=3.1e(b - v ) ) are reached at the nucleus up to within @xmath6902 from it .",
    "the goodness of the fit is measured in  by the percent mean deviation : _ _ adev__=@xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the observed spectrum and @xmath80 is the fitted model @xcite .",
    "the _ adev _ map for mrk1157 is shown in fig .",
    "[ pop2 ] and presents values @xmath81% at most locations , indicating that the model reproduces very well the observed underlying spectra .",
    "we point out that , in order to have a robust result on stellar population fitting with  it is important to have a reliable flux calibration ( see  manual ) . in other words",
    "the fit depends on the overall shape of the observed spectrum from the @xmath15 to the @xmath33-band , and our nifs observations misses the @xmath82-band .",
    "in order to verify the reliability of our flux calibration we have extracted a spectrum from our datacubes matching the aperture and position angle of our spex cross - dispersed spectrum @xcite .",
    "note that the spex data were taken in the cross - dispersed mode , and thus are free from seeing and aperture effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the comparison between both spectra is shown in fig .",
    "[ nifsxspex ] .",
    "it is clear that our nifs spectra have a reliable flux calibration .",
    "in fact the difference between the nifs and spex spectra is lower than 3% in the @xmath15 band . in addiditon",
    ", we have performed a simulation varying the flux of the @xmath15 band by 20% ( from 90% up to 110% ) and the difference to the population vector components is , in mean , @xmath705% indicating that our results are robust .",
    "in general , our results are similar to those obtained in the 2d mapping of the sp of mrk1066 @xcite as well as for previous nir studies using single aperture nuclear spectra @xcite . by mapping the stellar population in 2d we can analyse the spatial variations of the spcs in the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy .",
    "further , the significance of these variations is enhanced by the comparison with the @xmath2 map presented in fig .",
    "this map was obtained by fitting the k - band co absorption band - heads with the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite using as stellar template spectra those of the gemini library of late spectral type stars observed with the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) ifu and nifs @xcite .",
    "more details on the stellar kinematics of the central region of mrk1157 can be found in riffel & storchi - bergmann(_in prep . _ ) . the @xmath2 map shows a partial ring of low-@xmath2 values ( @xmath1 50 - 60@xmath83 ) surrounding the nucleus at @xmath1 08 ( 230pc ) from it , immersed in higher @xmath2 values of the bulge stars ( @xmath1 100@xmath83 ) .",
    "such rings are commonly observed in the central region of active galaxies and are due to kinematically colder regions with younger stars than the underlying bulge @xcite . the comparison between mrk1157 stellar population synthesis maps ( light- and mass - weighted ) and the @xmath2 map shows that the low @xmath2 ring is spatially correlated with the young - intermediate age spc , while the highest @xmath2s are associated with the old component .",
    "interestingly , very similar results were found by @xcite for mrk1066 .",
    "thus , the results found for mrk1157 and mrk1066 support the use of low stellar velocity dispersion as a tracer of young - intermediate age stars in the galaxy centre , thus confirming the interpretation of the above studies .        the most compressed form to represent the spcs mixture of a galaxy is by its mean stellar age , which was defined by @xcite in two ways : the first is weighted by light fraction , @xmath84 and the second , weighted by the stellar mass , @xmath85 being both definitions limited by the age range used in our base , the former is more representative of the younger ages while the latter is enhanced by the old spc @xcite .",
    "in order to compare our results with those derived using integrated spectra we have calculated the mean ages for the central region of mrk1157 .",
    "these mean ages in light- and mass - fractions are @xmath86 = 8.48 @xmath87 = 8.65 , respectively .",
    "note that these values were obtained taking the mean value over all the spectra in the map ( e.g. summing @xmath88 values over the map and dividing the result by the number of spectra in the map ) .",
    "besides our study of mrk1066 @xcite , to date , the only previous 2d stellar population studies of active galaxies in the nir are those from the group of r. i. davies .",
    "@xcite investigated the circumnuclear star formation in nine seyfert galaxies using the nir adaptive optics integral field spectrograph sinfoni at the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "based on measurements of the  emission - line equivalent width , supernova rate and mass - to - light ratio , these authors found circumnuclear disks of typical diameters of tens of pc with a  characteristic \" age in the range 10300  myr .",
    "such a  characteristic \" age can be associated with our mean age ( @xmath69 300 myr ) , thus our result for mrk1157 is in good agreement with those found by @xcite for their sample ( which does not include mrk1157 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by @xcite the methodology adopted here allowed us not only to obtain a  characteristic \" age , but to also map the spatial distribution of the spcs of different ages in the central region of a seyfert galaxy , on the basis of nir integral - field spectroscopy . moreover , our results are in reasonable agreement with those of @xcite where the authors use integrated long - slit spectroscopy ( considering the different apertures ) .    in further support to the results of the synthesis , we found that the average reddening map derived for the stellar population ( fig.[pop2 ] ) is in close agreement with the one derived for the narrow - line region using emission - line ratios ( riffel & storchi - bergmann , _ in prep . _ ) , presenting a similar structure and a very similar average value to that found by ( * ? ? ? * e(b - v)@xmath10.63 ) for the sp , using nir integrated spectra .",
    "as part of an ongoing project aimed at mapping the age distribution of the nir sp in the inner few hundred parsecs of seyfert galaxies , we present the spectral synthesis for the nuclear region of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk1157 ( ngc591 ) within the inner @xmath69 400 pc at spatial resolution of @xmath135pc . we have used a cleaning method which allowed us to remove the noise effects and redundant data from the 1d extractions , thus allowing a more accurate analysis of the spcs . using the noise free cube we have mapped the distribution of stellar population components of different ages and of their average reddening .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    * the cleaning technique presented here has allowed us to perform the spectral synthesis in noisy spectra ( e.g. borders of the datacube ) in a more accurate way . *",
