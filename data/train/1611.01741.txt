    "one of the basic problems on locally compact topological groups is to classify their lattices up to commensurability .",
    "recall that two lattices @xmath0 are commensurable if and only if there exists @xmath1 such that @xmath2 has finite index in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , commensurable lattices have covolumes that are commensurable rational numbers , that is , they have a rational ratio .",
    "the notion of commensurability was generalized to better suit topological and large - scale geometric properties and to compare groups without requiring them to be subgroups of a common group .",
    "more precisely , we say that two groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 are ( abstractly ) commensurable if they have isomorphic finite index subgroups . in this article , we will only be concerned with the notion of abstract commensurability and we simply refer to it as commensurability .",
    "as we mentioned , commensurability is closely related to the large - scale geometry of the group .",
    "indeed , any finitely generated group can be endowed with a natural word - metric which is well - defined up to quasi - isometry and since any finitely generated group is quasi - isometric to any its finite index subgroup , it follows that commensurable groups are quasi - isometric .",
    "gromov suggested to study groups from this geometric point of view and understand the relation between these two concepts .",
    "more precisely , a basic problem in geometric group theory is to classify commensurability and quasi - isometry classes ( perhaps within a certain class ) of finitely generated groups and to understand whether or not these classes coincide .",
    "the classification of groups up to commensurability ( both in the abstract and classical case ) has a long history and a number of famous solutions for very diverse classes of groups such as lie groups and more generally , locally compact topological groups , hyperbolic 3-manifold groups , pro - finite groups , grigorchuk - gupta - sidki groups , etc see for instance @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the question of classification of right - angled artin groups , raags for short , up to commensurability . recall that a raag is a finitely presented group @xmath7 which can be described by a finite simplicial graph @xmath8 , the commutation graph , in the following way : the vertices of @xmath8 are in bijective correspondence with the generators of @xmath7 and the set of defining relations of @xmath7 consists of commutation relations , one for each pair of generators connected by an edge in @xmath8 .",
    "raags have become central in group theory , their study interweaves geometric group theory with other areas of mathematics .",
    "this class interpolates between two of the most classical families of groups , free and free abelian groups , and its study provides uniform approaches and proofs , as well as rich generalisations of the results for free and free abelian groups .",
    "the study of this class from the different perspectives has contributed to the development of new , rich theories such as the theory of cat(0 ) cube complexes and has been an essential ingredient in agol s solution to the virtually fibred conjecture .",
    "the commensurability classification of raags has been previously considered for the following classes of raags :    * free groups @xcite , @xcite ;",
    "* free abelian groups , @xcite ; * @xmath9 , @xcite ; * free products of free groups and free abelian groups , @xcite ; * @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xcite ; * @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a tree of diameter @xmath12 ; * @xmath7 , when the outer automorphism of @xmath13 is finite , @xmath8 is star - rigid and does not have induced 4-cycles , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , inside the class of raags , the classification up to commensurability coincides with the quasi - isometric classification for all known cases .",
    "these rigidity results are mainly a consequence of the rigid structure of the intersection pattern of flats in the universal cover of the salvetti complex .    in this paper",
    "we describe the commensurability classes of raags defined by trees of diameter at most 4 and describe the `` minimal '' group in each commensurability class ( minimal in terms of number of generators or the rank of its abelianization ) . in particular , we show that there exist infinitely many different commensurability classes confirming a conjecture of behrstock and neumann . in their paper @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that raags defined by trees of diameter at least 3 are quasi - isometric , so we provide first examples of raags that are quasi - isometric but not commensurable . as in the classical case of lattices in",
    "locally compact topological groups , we define an ordered set that plays the role of the covolume and prove that the groups are commensurable if and only if the sets are commensurable , that is they have the same cardinality and constant rational ordered ratios .",
    "let @xmath14 be a graph without loops and double edges , then we denote by @xmath15 the raag defined by the commutation graph @xmath16 .",
    "we call the vertices of the graph @xmath16 the _ canonical generators _ of @xmath15 .    for our purposes",
    ", it will be convenient to encode finite trees of diameter four as follows .",
    "let @xmath17 be any finite tree of diameter four .",
    "let @xmath18 be a path ( without backtracking ) of length four from one leaf of @xmath17 to another",
    ". by definition @xmath18 contains 5 vertices and let @xmath19 be the middle vertex in @xmath18 .",
    "it is immediate to see that the choice of the vertex @xmath20 does not depend on the choice of the path @xmath18 of length four .",
    "we call @xmath21 the _ center _ of @xmath17 .    any leaf of @xmath17 connected to @xmath21 by an edge is called a _ hair",
    "vertex_. vertices connected to @xmath21 by an edge which are not hair are called _ pivots_.",
    "any finite tree @xmath17 of diameter 4 is uniquely defined by the number @xmath22 of hair vertices and by the number @xmath23 of pivots of a given degree @xmath24 .",
    "hence we encode any tree of diameter @xmath25 as @xmath26 . here",
    "all @xmath27 and @xmath23 and @xmath28 are positive integers , @xmath22 is a non - negative integer , and all @xmath27 are different ; moreover , either @xmath29 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that @xmath17 indeed has diameter 4 .",
    "see figure [ fig : tree4 ] .        given a tree of diameter four @xmath32 , we denote by @xmath33 the set of different numbers @xmath27 , that is , renaming if necessary , we have that @xmath34 .    in the original usage two rational numbers @xmath35",
    "are commensurable if and only if the ratio @xmath36 is rational . in this fashion",
    ", we will say that two ordered sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 are _ commensurable _ if they have the same cardinality , i.e. @xmath39 , and each quotient @xmath40 . in this case",
    "we write @xmath41 .",
    "we say that a set @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is minimal if the greatest common divisor @xmath44 is 1 .",
    "it is clear that in each commensurability class of a set @xmath45 , there exists a minimal set that belongs to the class , namely @xmath46 .",
    "we show that the commensurability class of the set @xmath47 determines the commensurability class of the raag defined by the tree of a diameter 4 .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath48 be two finite trees of diameter 4 , @xmath32 and @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "consider the sets @xmath52 , @xmath53",
    ". then @xmath13 and @xmath54 are commensurable if and only if @xmath55 and @xmath56 are commensurable .",
    "for @xmath57 denote by @xmath58 the path with @xmath59 vertices and @xmath60 edges . by a minimal raag in some class @xmath61 we mean a raag in @xmath61 with the minimal number of generators , i.e. , defined by a graph with minimal number of vertices among all commutation graphs of raags in @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a finite tree of diameter 4 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the commensurability class of @xmath63 and let @xmath52 be as above , so @xmath64 .",
    "then the minimal raag that belongs to @xmath62 is either the raag defined by the tree @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is minimal in the commensurability class of @xmath55 , if @xmath67 , or the raag defined by the path of diameter 3 , that is @xmath68 , if @xmath69 .",
    "our results extend naturally to the commensurability classification of some right - angled coxeter groups .",
    "recall that every raag @xmath13 embeds naturally as a finite index subgroup into a right - angled coxeter group , say @xmath70 .",
    "hence , we have the following result    there are infinitely many pair - wise quasi - isometric , but pair - wise not commensurable right - angled coxeter groups defined by graphs of diameter 4 with cliques of dimension @xmath71 .    in their work @xcite , behrstock and neumann introduced the notion of @xmath59-trees and gave a description of the quasi - isometry classes of raags defined by @xmath59-trees . in particular , to each @xmath59-tree , the authors associate a 2-coloured graph , which corresponds to a graph of groups decomposition , where vertex groups are isomorphic to @xmath72 and edge groups are isomorphic to @xmath73 . as trees of diameter 4",
    "have a central vertex , @xmath59-trees have a central @xmath60-simplex , say @xmath74 .",
    "vertices of degree @xmath60 are analogs of leaves of a tree . if a `` leaf '' @xmath75 on the @xmath59-tree only belongs to the @xmath59-simplex @xmath76 , we say that @xmath75 is a hair vertex . otherwise , vertices which do not belong to the central simplex and are not `` leaves '' of the @xmath59-tree are called pivots of the @xmath59-tree .",
    "hence , one can encode an @xmath59-tree @xmath77 of diameter @xmath25 ( i.e. those @xmath59-trees whose associated graph has diameter @xmath25 ) as a tuple @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the rank of the pivot minus @xmath80 .",
    "as above , let @xmath81 .",
    "the interested reader can check that the proofs given in this paper for paths of diameter @xmath25 extend almost verbatim to @xmath59-trees of diameter 4 and we have the following    let @xmath77 and @xmath82 be two @xmath59-trees of diameter @xmath25 . then @xmath83 and @xmath84 are commensurable if and only if the set @xmath85 and @xmath86 are commensurable .",
    "as we discussed , in previous results on commensurability of raags , the structure of the intersection pattern of flats inside the universal cover of the salvetti complex is so rigid that the large - scale geometry that it determines forces commensurability .    in our case ,",
    "all trees of diameter 4 are quasi - isometric and so geometry is not sufficient to determine the commensurability classes .",
    "however , we will use the structure of the intersection pattern of flats together with algebra to derive the result .",
    "we encode the intersection pattern in a finite graph obtained as a quotient of the reduced extension graph of the raag by the action of the subgroup @xmath5 .",
    "this finite graph has an abstract algebraic interpretation : its vertices correspond to conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups whose centraliser is non - abelian ; and its edges are defined via commutation of some representatives in the class . defined this way , the graph is an algebraic invariant , that is if @xmath87 is an isomorphism , then @xmath88 induces an isomorphism between the finite graphs associated to @xmath5 and @xmath89 and so an isomorphism between the ( conjugacy classes of ) non - abelian centralisers . in our case , non - abelian centralisers are of the form @xmath90 and so we can finally obtain isomorphism between free groups .",
    "the isomorphism between subgroups of free groups of different ranks imposes conditions on the indices of the corresponding subgroups , and so , restrictions on the powers of conjugates of generators that belong to @xmath5 and @xmath89 .",
    "we encode these conditions in a linear system of equations .",
    "if the subgroups @xmath5 and @xmath89 are isomorphic , then the system must have positive integer solutions . finally , we show that for the system to have positive solutions the sets @xmath91 and @xmath66 need to be commensurable .",
    "we believe that the general strategy of our proof , that is to reduce the existence of subgroups to a linear system of equations with positive integer solutions , can be used to study commensurability classes of raags defined by trees and more general raags . the real obstacle is to elucidate the necessary conditions for the system of equations to have positive integer solutions  `` just '' a linear algebra problem .",
    "below we always conjugate as follows @xmath92 .    note that centralisers in raags are isolated , that is for any element @xmath93 and any non - zero integer @xmath94 we have that @xmath95 , see @xcite .    recall that for any raag given by the commutation graph @xmath16 the _ extension graph _",
    "@xmath96 is defined as follows , see @xcite .",
    "the vertex set of @xmath96 is the set of all elements of @xmath15 which are conjugate to the canonical generators ( vertices of @xmath16 ) .",
    "two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if the corresponding group elements commute .",
    "the group @xmath15 acts on @xmath96 by conjugation .",
    "in some sense , the extension graph encodes the structure of the intersection pattern of flats inside the universal cover of the salvetti complex .",
    "it plays an essential role in establishing the quasi - isometric rigidity of the class of raags with finite outer automorphism groups , see @xcite .",
    "observe that if the graph @xmath16 is a tree , then @xmath15 splits as the fundamental group of a graph of groups as follows .",
    "the underlying graph is @xmath16 , and the vertex group at every vertex is defined to be the centralizer of the corresponding canonical generator .",
    "note that if @xmath97 is some vertex of @xmath16 , and @xmath98 are all vertices of @xmath16 adjacent to @xmath97 , then @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the free group of rank @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , @xmath102 is abelian if and only if @xmath97 has degree 1 , and in this case @xmath103 is contained in the centralizer of the vertex adjacent to @xmath97 . for an edge @xmath104 connecting vertices @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath97 the edge group at @xmath104 is @xmath106 .",
    "we call this splitting the _ centralizer splitting _ of @xmath15 .    note that the centralizer splitting is neither reduced nor minimal , since for every vertex of degree 1 in @xmath16 the vertex group is equal to the incident edge group .",
    "thus it makes sense to consider the _",
    "reduced centralizer splitting _ of @xmath15 ( for a tree @xmath16 ) , which is obtained from the centralizer splitting by removing all vertices of degree 1 .",
    "it is easy to see that this splitting is already minimal and reduced .",
    "analogously , for a tree @xmath16 one can consider the full subgraph of the extension graph @xmath96 , whose vertex set is the set of all elements of @xmath15 which are conjugate to the canonical generators corresponding to vertices of @xmath16 of degree more than 1 ( which are exactly those which have non - abelian centralizers ) .",
    "call this subgraph the _ reduced extension graph _ of @xmath16 , and denote it by @xmath107 .",
    "the reduced extension graph will play an essential role in the classification of raags up to commensurability . if @xmath108 is a subgroup of finite index , then @xmath5 intersects each cyclic subgroup associated to the vertex groups of the reduced extension graph in a non - trivial cyclic subgroup , that is @xmath109 for some @xmath110 , @xmath1 . on the other hand , by the description of centralisers in raags , every element in @xmath5",
    "whose centraliser is non - abelian belongs to some cyclic subgroup @xmath111 .",
    "since the set of elements with non - abelian centralisers is an invariant set up to isomorphism , it follows that the reduced extension graph is an algebraic invariant in the class of finite index subgroups of @xmath112 , that is if @xmath113 and @xmath114 , then the graph @xmath115 whose vertex set is in one - to - one correspondence with maximal cyclic subgroups generated by elements of @xmath6 with non - abelian centraliser and there is an edge @xmath116 whenever the corresponding elements commute , is isomorphic to the reduced extension graph of @xmath112 ( see lemma [ l2 ] ) .    from this observation",
    ", one can deduce that many classes of raags are not commensurable ( without using the stronger fact that they are not quasi - isometric ) .",
    "for instance , raags whose defining graphs are trees are not commensurable to raags whose defining graph have cycles ; or raags defined by cycles of different lengths are not commensurable , etc . at this point ,",
    "a couple of remarks are in order .",
    "firstly , the above observation does not extend to the extension graph , that is , commensurable raags may not have isomorphic extension graphs .",
    "for instance , we will show that the raags defined by paths of length 3 and 4 are commensurable but their extension graphs are not isomorphic ( leaves in the tree are also leaves in the extension graphs and the minimal distances in the extension graphs between leaves is 3 and 4 respectively ) .",
    "the reason here is that there are elements with abelian centralisers that are _ not _ powers of conjugates of the canonical generators",
    "so they are not accounted at all in the extension graph .",
    "secondly , the isomorphism of the reduced extension graph is a necessary condition but it is by far not sufficient .",
    "all raags defined by trees of diameter 4 have isomorphic reduced extension graphs but there are infinitely many non - commensurable classes .    in the next lemmas",
    "we notice that the two trees , the ( reduced ) extension graph and the bass - serre tree associated to the ( reduced ) centraliser splitting are equivalent and that the reduced extension graph and its quotient by the action of @xmath5 is invariant up to isomorphism .",
    "[ bs ] if @xmath16 is a tree , then @xmath96 is also a tree , which is isomorphic ( as a graph ) to the bass - serre tree @xmath17 corresponding to the centralizer splitting of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , @xmath107 is a subtree of @xmath96 , which is isomorphic ( as a graph ) to the bass - serre tree @xmath117 corresponding to the reduced centralizer splitting of @xmath15 .",
    "the graph isomorphisms above are equivariant , in the sense that the action of @xmath15 by conjugation on @xmath96 ( or @xmath107 ) corresponds to the natural action of @xmath15 on the bass - serre tree of the centralizer splitting ( reduced centralizer splitting , respectively ) .",
    "from now on we denote @xmath118 .",
    "every vertex of @xmath96 has the form @xmath119 , where @xmath97 is some canonical generator of @xmath13 , and @xmath120 . by bass - serre theory ,",
