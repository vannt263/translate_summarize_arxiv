    "the idea of oscillating universe is ancient , in which the universe oscillates through many successive expansion / contraction cycles , which was proposed originally by tolman @xcite in the 1930 s .",
    "recently this idea has been awaken again in cyclic scenario @xcite , which is motivated by the string / m theory .",
    "the relevant dynamics with primordial perturbations can be described by an effective theory in which the separation of the branes in the extra dimensions is modeled as a scalar field .",
    "but the problems around bounce may remain . for contracting universe , it is hard to escape from a singularity in the frame of general relativity .",
    "thus for the scenario of oscillating universe , one of difficulties of implementing it is how to obtain a non singular bounce .",
    "several proposals have been discussed , such as using the negative energy density @xcite or curvature term @xcite , or some high order correction term in the action @xcite .    during contraction of each cycles , the scalar field can be driven and roll up along its potential to large enough value for inflation to occur , which has been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite for closed universe , in which it has been shown that an oscillating universe certainly undergoes inflation after a finite number of cycles . during this process ,",
    "a contracting phase dominated by kinetic energy followed by an inflation .",
    "further , in ref . @xcite , such scenario has been proposed to provide a possible explanation for the observed low cmb anisotropies on large angular scale . in this proposal ,",
    "a kinetic dominated contracting phase is matched to an inflation phase .",
    "the power spectrum during the contraction @xmath0 , which lead to an intense suppression of cmb quadrupole , in the meantime the nearly scale - invariant spectrum from slow - roll inflation is recover on small scale .",
    "but a physical mechanism for bounce is not included . in this paper , we make use of possible high energy correction to the friedmann eq .",
    "@xcite to implement the bounce .",
    "we firstly focus the behavior of massive scalar field during such a bounce semianalytically and find that the slow - roll inflation can be preceded by the kinetic dominated contraction and the required e - folds number during the inflation after the bounce limits the energy scale of bounce .",
    "finally we check and confirm these features numerically .",
    "note that a similar scenario has been studied in string inspired frame @xcite , in which the gauss - bonnet term is used to construct a non singular bounce and the superinflation regime before slow - roll inflation leads to a suppression of primordial spectrum .",
    "this has also a similarity to the case in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the effects from loop quantum gravity can driven the inflaton to its potential hill and increase the parameter space of initial conditions for successful inflation .",
    "furthermore , the oscillatory universe induced by the effects from loop quantum gravity was investigated in ref .",
    "in this section we study the cosmological behavior of massive scalar field before and after a bounce phase semianalytically .",
    "we use the modified friedmann equation h^2 = 13 ( _ - _ ^2 ) [ h2 ] to implement a realistic bounce , where @xmath1 has been set , @xmath2 is the energy density of scalar field and @xmath3 is the bounce scale , when @xmath4 , the universe bounces .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) may be motivated in brane world scenario @xcite , see also @xcite , where our universe is embedded in high dimension space / time , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent introduction .",
    "further it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that due to the effects of the bulk and israel matching conditions there might be some forms @xmath5 which is not standard fridmann - like .",
    "the motion equation of scalar field @xmath6 with the mass @xmath7 is + 3h + m^2=0 [ phi ]    we assume that initially the universe is in contracting phase and the field @xmath6 is in the bottom of its potential . thus @xmath2 is small and the term @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) is negligible .",
    "some possible fluctuations will make @xmath6 departure from its minimum and oscillate near @xmath9 . since in this case",
    "@xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ the frequency of oscillation is much larger than the evolution rate of universe , thus after implementing the change of variable @xmath11 , + m^2 u 0 can approximately be obtained , which can be solved as an oscillation u u_a [ ophi]where @xmath12 is a constant amplitude .",
    "thus we have = a^-32 u_a [ phimt]when taking the time average over many oscillations of field , @xmath13 is obtained , which is similar to the case dominated by matter . thus in this regime the universe contracts as @xmath14 and the energy density of the field grows as _ ~a^-3 u_a^2 m^2[rho]from ( [ rho ] ) , we can see that with the contraction of universe the energy density of scalar field increases .",
    "thus when @xmath15 , the term relevant with @xmath16 of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) can no more be neglected . in this case , @xmath17 , which can be reduced to @xmath18 .",
    "thus as long as the oscillating amplitude of @xmath6 field is larger than @xmath19 , the oscillation of field will end and the field will roll up along its potential . instead of eq .",
    "( [ phimt ] ) , + 3h0 .",
    "[ kphi]is satisfied . from eq .",
    "( [ kphi ] ) , we have [ phia]where @xmath20 is the integral constant . thus with the further contraction the universe will enter into the regime dominated by kinetic energy of field rapidly , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to @xmath23 , thus we have a^3c(t_s - t ) [ a3s]where @xmath24 is the the integral constant . and _ k + [ phibou]where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the value of field and time just entering into the regime dominated by kinetic energy , respectively .",
    "when the kinetic energy of @xmath6 approaches @xmath3 , we have to includes the @xmath8 correction in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) . thus instituting eq .",
    "( [ phia ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) , we obtain 6(aa)^2= c^2a^12(a^6-c^22 ) [ h4]whose solution can be obtained as follows a^3 = [ a6]where @xmath27 is the integral constant determined by @xmath3 as well as the value of @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 , the scale factor of the universe arrives at its minimum and after @xmath27 the universe bounces and expands .    for the universe dominated by stiff fluid with the same state equation @xmath32 as the case dominated by kinetic energy of scalar field , its evolution will symmetric before and after the bounce , and up to all time .",
    "but the evolution of the universe driven by massive scalar field is different from that with fluid .",
    "after the bounce , the field @xmath6 will still roll up .",
    "however , since @xmath33 , the term @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) serves as a damping term .",
    "thus the roll - up motion of @xmath6 will decay quickly .",
    "when the velocity of @xmath6 arrives at 0 , it reverses and rolls down along the potential . for the case of @xmath35",
    ", we have @xmath36 .",
    "the field will enters the slow - roll regime in which the universe is dominated by the potential energy of the scalar field and 3h + m^20 , is satisfied . in this case @xmath37 and the universe inflates .",
    "the motion of field @xmath6 is given by _",
    "r - mtwhere @xmath38 is the value of field at reverse .",
    "when @xmath39 , _ i.e. _ @xmath40 , the inflation ends and the field @xmath6 will reenter into an oscillatory stage .    therefore from above discussion , we can see that before the bounce , the field initially in the bottom of its potential can be driven by roll up its potential hill and after the bounce it reverses and rolls down , and drives the inflation of universe .",
    "then we study the above evolutive process numerically . we take @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for initial values .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath29 and @xmath16 are plotted in fig .",
    "we can see distinctly that the bounce is implemented . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the evolution of field @xmath6 .",
    "initially the field oscillates about the bottom of its potential many times , then the field @xmath6 roll up along its potential rapidly .",
    "the field still rolls up after the bounce , but its velocity will approaches 0 quickly .",
    "thus shortly it will reverse and roll down , and then enter into slow - roll regime .",
    "when the field decreases to @xmath46 linearly , the slow - roll ends and the field will oscillates about @xmath47 again .",
    "these numerical results are consistent with our semianalytical discussions in last section .",
    "the modification scale @xmath3 determines the energy scale of bounce , thus in some sense also determines the maximal value @xmath48 which the @xmath6 can roll up to , see fig . 3 for numerical solutions with various @xmath3 .",
    "we can simply estimate the value of @xmath38 .",
    "when the field just enter into the stage dominated by kinetic energy , @xmath49 can be satisfied approximately , and when the field is at the point of the bounce , its value is @xmath50 .",
    "thus from eqs .",
    "( [ phia ] ) and ( [ a3s ] ) , we have ( t_s- t _ bt_s - t_k)^2 = ( a_ba _ k)^6 = ( _ k _ b)^2instituting it into eq .",
    "( [ phibou ] ) , _ r _ k + [ phibou2]can be obtained , where the second term has been doubled since during kinetic dominated regime the evolution of the field can be regarded approximately as symmetrical before and after the bounce , which can also be seen from fig .",
    "4 . for a reasonable estimation ,",
    "we take @xmath51 , thus obtain @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 , which is compatible with the numerical results of fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "there is a up - limit @xmath56 for @xmath57 , in which the modification of friedmann equation is at planck scale .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ phibou2 ] ) , for massive scalar field initially in the bottom of its potential with a small velocity from fluctuations , the maximal value that it can roll up to during the contraction is only dependent on its mass @xmath7 and the modification scale @xmath3 .",
    "the larger @xmath38 is , the longer the time that the universe after the bounce inflates is .",
    "( solid line ) and the hubble parameter @xmath16 ( dashing line ) as a function of time .",
    "the inset is a zoom before and after the bounce .",
    "@xmath16 has been multiplied by 1000 . , width=302 ]     ( solid line ) and the field @xmath6 as a function of time .",
    ", width=302 ]     as a function of time for various @xmath3 . from long dashing line to solid line , @xmath3 takes 0.0001 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath7 is taken same , initially the oscillation of fields has same frequency , which can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ophi ] ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    focusing on the chaotic inflation model @xcite , instead of @xmath58 on whole paper , we take @xmath59 here .",
    "the e - folds number is given by n 2_r^2 and eq .",
    "( [ phibou2 ] ) is modified as _",
    "k + [ phibou3]for @xmath60 , this requires @xmath61 .",
    "considering @xmath62 required by observational primordial perturbations , the limit to @xmath3 is given by @xmath63 .",
    "further for @xmath64 the maximal value that the field can roll up to is given by @xmath65 , which is suitable for a successful inflationary cosmology but is far away from eternal inflation @xcite .",
    "( solid line ) and the field @xmath6 ( dashing line ) as a function of time for an oscillating universe .",
    ", width=302 ]         as a function of time for an oscillating universe .",
    "the long , short dashing and solid lines are the cases of @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath67 , from ( [ phibou2 ] ) , we have @xmath68 . in this case ,",
    "inflation dose not occur in each cycle , thus the amplitude of successive cycle dose not increase .",
    ", width=302 ]    we have found that the slow - roll inflation after the bounce can be preceded by the kinetic dominated contraction . further we would like to check this feature in a controlled model of oscillating universe .",
    "in the minimum .",
    "the details of cosmology with negative potential have been studied in ref .",
    "] we plot the evolutions of @xmath69 and the ( kinetic , potential ) energy with time in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 , respectively . to show the oscillation of universe better , we take @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath43 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 for initial values .",
    "we see that the maximum of expansion amplitude in each successive expansion / contraction cycle grows gradually .",
    "this asymmetry of cosmological evolution seems conflicted with intuition , since both the field equation ( [ phi ] ) and fridmann equation ( [ h2 ] ) are non dissipative and time reverse invariant .",
    "the reason of asymmetry has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of closed universe .",
    "however , in fact this is not dependent on the curvature of universe , but the evolutive behavior of scalar field . for @xmath74 , during the expansion , the state equation @xmath75 , thus the field is in slow - roll regime and the universe expands exponentially _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath76 .",
    "however , during the contraction , the universe is dominated by kinetic energy of scalar field . in this case , @xmath77 .",
    "thus the time when the field rolls up to the value from which it will roll down into slow - roll inflationary regime is more shorter .",
    "it is the evolutive asymmetry of the field that leads to the growth of successive expansion / contraction cycles . when that @xmath78 is the same order as @xmath3 , from ( [ phibou2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath79 . in this case",
    ", the field can not roll up to slow - roll regime .",
    "thus the asymmetry between the expansion driven by the potential of field and the contraction driven by the kinetic term of field will not exist .",
    "we can see from fig . 7",
    "that the amplitude of successive cycle does not increase in this case .",
    "we make use of possible high energy correction to the friedmann equation to implement a bounce .",
    "we study the behavior of massive field and find that the slow - roll inflation can be preceded by the kinetic dominated contraction . during this process",
    ", the field initially in the bottom of its potential can be driven by the anti - frictional force resulted from the contraction and roll up its potential hill .",
    "we show that the required e - folds number during the inflation after the bounce limits the energy scale of bounce , for @xmath60 , @xmath80 is required .",
    "further unlike that expected , in our case the field can not arrive arbitrary large value , even though the bounce occurs at planck scale , for @xmath57 , we have @xmath81 .",
    "the reason is that during the contraction the kinetic energy of the field is much larger than its potential energy and the growth of the field value is only logarithmical .",
    "when the kinetic energy approaches @xmath3 , its potential energy is still far less , see fig .",
    "3 . these features have been checked and confirmed numerically . moreover , for possible oscillating universe model , we point out that the successive increasing of expansion amplitude of each cycle is actually depended on whether there exists inflation in each cycle . for the oscillating universe without inflation in its each cycle , its amplitude dose not increase with time .",
