    "currently , we witness an impressive progress in realizing coherent quantum dynamics of macroscopic solid state devices @xcite . very recently , experimental results on the quantum dynamics of a superconducting flux qubit coupled to a read - out squid have been reported @xcite .",
    "the flux qubit consists of a superconducting ring with three josephson junctions and , in the proper parameter regime , it forms a quantum mechanical macroscopic two - state system ( tss ) .",
    "an external time - dependent driving force controls the state of the tss .",
    "a squid couples inductively to the qubit and , together with an external shunt capacitance , it can be modeled as a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) . due to the coupling of the squid to the surrounding environment , the harmonic oscillator is ( weakly ) damped .",
    "the state of the qubit can be inferred from the state of the squid .",
    "the experiment provides spectroscopic data on the different transition frequencies of the coupled tss - ho device . moreover , rabi oscillations involving different pairs of quantum states of the device have been revealed , including the so - termed red and blue sideband transitions between energy states of the coupled tss - ho system .    heading for a comprehensive detailed understanding , a quantitative modeling which includes the effects of time - dependent driving , decoherence and dissipation",
    "is required .",
    "our description goes beyond the well - known jaynes - cummings model @xcite , by avoiding the strong rotating - wave approximation and by including a microscopic model for the environment .",
    "a generic theoretical model for studying the environmental effects on a driven tss is the driven spin - boson model @xcite where the tss tunneling splitting is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the environment is characterized by a spectral density @xmath2 .",
    "the widest used form is that of an ohmic spectral density , where @xmath2 is proportional to the frequency @xmath3 .",
    "it mimics the effects of an unstructured ohmic electromagnetic environment . in the classical limit this leads to white noise and all transitions in the system",
    "are damped equally .",
    "however , if the environment for the qubit is formed by a quantum measuring device which itself is damped by ohmic fluctuations , the simple description as an ohmic environment might become inappropriate .",
    "in particular , the squid - detector being well described as a ho can equally well be considered as a ( broadened ) localized mode of the environment influencing the qubit as the central quantum system . in this picture , the plasma resonance at frequency @xmath4 of the squid gives rise to a non - ohmic effective spectral density @xmath5 for the qubit with a lorentzian peak at the plasma frequency of the detector @xcite .",
    "the effects of such a structured spectral density on decoherence have been investigated in several theoretical works in various limits .",
    "the role of the external driving being in resonance with the symmetric tss at zero temperature has been studied in ref . within a bloch - redfield formalism being equivalent to a perturbative approach in @xmath6 .",
    "analysis @xcite is based on the assumption of weak interaction between the tss and the ho being equivalent to a perturbative approach in @xmath6 as well .",
    "moreover , a rotating - wave approximation is used .",
    "the first assumption , however , might become problematic if the driven tss is in resonance with the ho . the results presented in refs .",
    "reveal in fact , for the undriven case , that a perturbative approach in @xmath6 breaks down for strong qubit - detector coupling , and when the qubit and detector frequencies are comparable . dephasing times at zero temperature have been determined for the undriven spin - boson model with a structured environment in ref .   within a numerical flow equation method .",
    "the interplay between the external driving and the dynamics of the coupled tss - ho system yields to additional multi - photon transitions , which can be explained only by considering the spectrum of the coupled system .",
    "these resonances have recently been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "if the time - scale of the ho does not play a role , the multi - photon resonances occur in the driven qubit solely , which happens when the driving frequency ( or integer multiples of it ) matches the characteristic energy scales of the qubit @xcite .",
    "such multiphoton resonances can be experimentally detected in an ac - driven flux qubit by measuring the asymptotic occupation probabilities of the qubit , as the dc - field is varied @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the resonances were obtained by matching the frequency of the ac - field with the qubit energy levels only , where the detector energy levels did not play a role .",
    "these qubit resonances , which have also been theoretically investigated within a bloch equation formalism in ref .  , could be explained in terms of intrinsic transitions in a driven spin - boson system with an unstructured environment .    in this paper , we provide a comprehensive theoretical description of the driven spin - boson system in the presence of a structured environment with one localized mode . upon making use of the equivalence of this generic model with the model of a driven tss coupled to an",
    "ohmically damped ho , we first consider the experimentally most interesting case of low temperature and weak damping of the ho while the coupling between the tss and the ho is kept arbitrary . in this regime",
    ", a floquet - born - markov master equation can be established for the driven tss - ho system .",
    "a restriction to the most relevant energy states allows the analytic calculation of the asymptotic tss time - averaged population @xmath7 , including the explicit shape of the resonance peaks and dips .",
    "we furthermore consider the case of strong damping and/or high temperature which is the complementary parameter regime .",
    "an analytic real - time path - integral approach within the non - interacting blip approximation for the driven tss with the lorentzian - shaped spectral density allows to analytically determine @xmath7 as well .",
    "we compare the results obtained from closed analytic expressions with those of numerically exact real - time quapi calculations in both parameter regimes and find a very good agreement validating our analytical approaches . finally , we consider the weakly damped tss with the localized mode in the limit of large ho frequencies .",
    "then , the localized mode acts as a high - frequency cutoff and the usual ohmically damped driven tss is recovered . for this case , we employ an approximation valid for large driving frequencies and obtain a simple expression for the resonance line shapes for multi - photon transitions .",
    "most importantly , we find that the width of the @xmath0-photon resonance scales with the @xmath0-th ordinary bessel function . parts of our results have been published in a short work in ref .   .",
