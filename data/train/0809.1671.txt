    "since the first discoveries of extrasolar giant planets around nearby sun - like stars with doppler velocimetry ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 ) , extrasolar planet research has experienced a spectacular series of observational breakthroughs . in recent years , progress has been particularly rapid with a subset of close - in extrasolar planets found to transit the disk of their host star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the first transit observation of a hot jupiter ( charbonneau et al.2000 ; henry et al .",
    "2000 ) has been followed by many such measurements , including a growing number of new close - in planet discoveries based on transit searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the brightest nearby systems with transiting planets , this has also enabled the detection of the planetary thermal flux occulted at secondary eclipse ( e.g. , deming et al .",

    "2006 ; knutson et al .",
    "2007 , 2008b ; cowan et al . 2007 ) , ir spectral measurements ( grillmair et al . 2007",
    "; richardson et al . 2007 ; knutson et al .",
    "2008a ) as well as a variety of additional constraints based on transit spectroscopic studies ( tinetti et al . 2007 ; ehrenreich et al .",

    "the need to interpret these astronomical data reliably , so as to infer the physical conditions present in distant exoplanetary atmospheres , has also fueled a growing atmospheric modeling effort .",
    "while plane - parallel radiative models have been the tools of choice to interpret these data until now , they are likely insufficient in the case of hot jupiter / neptune atmospheres . indeed , due to their short orbital separations",
    ", all these exoplanets are expected be tidally - locked to their parent star ( or , in some cases , pseudo - synchronized ) .",
    "tidally - locked planets are subject to an unusual situation of permanent , asymmetric day / night radiative forcing , leading to heat redistribution by atmospheric motions .",
    "current data on hot jupiters already indicate that existing one - dimensional radiative transfer models fail to capture the multi - dimensional nature of this atmospheric regime ( e.g. , seager et al . 2005 ; knutson et al . 2007 ; 2008b ;",
    "fortney et al . 2006 ) and , when included , the effects of atmospheric heat redistribution are usually accounted for only indirectly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "to adequately address this circulation regime and interpret the growing data set , multi - dimensional , coupled radiation - hydrodynamics models of these atmospheres are required ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "hot jupiters have high atmospheric temperatures , slow rotation rates and an unusually permanent pattern of asymmetric day / night radiative forcing . recognizing that this constitutes an interesting problem in atmospheric dynamics , several groups have explored plausible circulation regimes on these planets using different modeling approaches and assumptions .",
    "these investigations have exhibited significant diversity in flow results , for which there currently is no simple unifying explanation ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "atmospheres in motion are non - linear , presumably turbulent flows . in addition , radiatively active species in an atmosphere are advected by the flow and in doing so non - linearly couple the flow to its effective source of radiative forcing .",
    "simulated atmospheric flows are thus generally expected to be sensitive to various numerical and physical details of any specific implementation . in the exoplanetary context , with rather limited direct information on the atmospheres studied , this means that simple parameterized models isolating key features of the simulated flow are important in helping us understand the general behavior of remote atmospheric flows . with this in mind , we present here idealized atmospheric models which emphasize dynamical aspects under linear forcing conditions .",
    "these simplified models do not address any detailed aspect of the radiative or chemical structure of the atmospheres under consideration .    in general , different numerical implementations of a specific atmospheric problem will not lead to identical results . for this reason ,",
    "model validations and inter - comparisons are standard practices in atmospheric science .",
    "this is particularly true of the complex hydrodynamic solvers known as dynamical cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the development of dynamical cores to solve the equations satisfied by an hydrostatic atmosphere in motion has been a major enterprise .",

    "* ) . in the exoplanetary context",
    ", different modeling groups have used various hydrodynamic solvers .",
    "some are new and little tested while others are old , well - tested but only validated under conditions appropriate for solar system planetary atmospheres . as a result , intercomparisons and validations of dynamical cores on idealized atmospheric problems tailored for exoplanets will be important in the future to assess , both qualitatively and quantitatively , how reliable our interpretations of exoplanetary data can be .    as a first step in this direction , we present here a simple earth - like validation of the igcm dynamical core ( in  3 ) , followed by a direct extension of this model to the atmospheric flow on a hot jupiter ( in  4 ) .",

    "the vertical profile of equilibrium temperature used has two regions , a lower atmosphere ( troposphere ) where temperature decreases with height at a fixed rate , and an upper atmosphere ( stratosphere ) which is vertically isothermal .",

    "differential heating and cooling of atmospheric regions around the planet drives atmospheric motions .",
    "in addition to the vertical dependence in equation  ( [ eq : teqz ] ) , one must also specify the latitudinal and longitudinal dependence of the temperature relaxation profile . in our models ,",

    "when using the primitive equations , one assumes that effects on small scales , which are not adequately described by the equations , nor resolved numerically , can be parameterized within the framework of the large - scale dynamics .",

    "by contrast , circulation regimes are a priori unknown on exoplanets and it may be difficult to determine from first principles the temperature relaxation profiles and relaxation times needed to adequately drive or drag the flow on a remote planet",

    "the maps are shown at the @xmath123 level . while this particular example was chosen to exhibit clear temperature and flow field variability over one planet day , dynamical variability is a general property of the simulated flow ( see fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the displaced anticyclonic polar vortices that emerge in this hot jupiter model do not experience systematic longitudinal translations , nor are they close to geostrophic balance , like the cyclonic circumpolar vortices discussed by @xcite . instead , the polar vortices in the present model appear to be strongly tied to the imposed day - night forcing and show only limited excursions away from their preferred night - side location , somewhat eastward of the anti - stellar point ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : three ] , [ fig : six ] and  [ fig : seven ] ) .",
    "the wind acceleration episode apparent in figure  [ fig : five ] must be important in determining the nature of the stationary regime eventually achieved by the forced flow .",
    "we have found evidence that barotropic instabilities play a role in shaping the dynamical nature of this flow . during the first few planet days in our hot jupiter model",
    ", we observe the acceleration of a zonal eastward wind in the equatorial regions and westward counter - jets at mid - latitudes .",
    "this situation is very reminiscent of the counter - acceleration caused by meridional rossby wave transport that occurs in the idealized momentum - forced flow discussed by @xcite in the context of the equivalent - barotropic formulation ( see their fig .",
    "figure  [ fig : eight ] shows a temperature and velocity map at planet day 5 and level @xmath130 in our t42l15 hot jupiter model .",
    "in contrast with previous maps , this one zooms in a specific region along the equator , restricted @xmath131 to @xmath132 in longitude and @xmath133 in latitude . in this region ,",
    "the flow exhibits strong horizontal ( zonal ) shear , as well as small scale velocity and temperature disturbances along the leading edge of the equatorial jet .",
    "subsequently , we observe a rapid thinning of the jet , a breaking of equatorial symmetry by planet day @xmath134-@xmath135 and the emergence of a broader , wavy equatorial wind , as shown for instance in figure  [ fig : three ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : nine ] suggests that horizontal shear (= barotropic ) instabilities are important dynamical ingredients of the sequential flow evolution we have just described .",
    "the latitudinal profile of zonally - averaged zonal wind velocity , @xmath96 $ ] , is shown in the top panel , while its second - order meridional derivative , @xmath136/dy^2 $ ] , is shown in the bottom panel , for the same planet day 5 and @xmath137 level flow as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eight ] .",
    "although necessary and sufficient conditions for the development of barotropic ( horizontal shear ) instabilities are generally not known , the rayleigh - kuo inflexion point criterion provides a useful necessary condition , which accounts for the stabilizing influence of the planetary vorticity @xcite .",
    "the instability condition is met when @xmath136/dy^2 $ ] exceeds the planetary parameter @xmath138 ( latitudinal gradient of the coriolis parameter ) , which is shown as a dotted line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : nine ] . while the moderate violations of the rayleigh - kuo criterion at mid - latitudes and beyond may not be very meaningful . applying a zonal instability criterion in these regions",
    "may thus be of limited value .",
    "] , the strong violations on each side of the equatorial wind , at @xmath139 latitude , are consistent with the substantial zonal shear present there and the associated small scale disturbances shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eight ] .",
    "we note that the significance of barotropic instabilities operating in the flow , as suggested by figures .",
    "[ fig : eight ] and  [ fig : nine ] , is that they could play an important dynamical role by tapping the free energy available in the horizontal shear flow and thus possibly limit the asymptotic speeds of winds in our model .",
    "while wind acceleration followed by saturation in the first @xmath140 days , as shown in figure  [ fig : five ] , appears to be broadly consistent with this notion , additional flow diagnostics beyond the scope of the present study would be needed to establish more confidently this possibility .",
    "in this work , we have presented a simple earth - like general circulation model based on the igcm dynamical core .",
    "we used this model to contrast the baroclinic circulation regime of the earth s lower atmosphere with the more barotropic circulation regime that emerges from a straightforward extension of the model to the atmospheric flow on a hot jupiter .",
    "the distinction between these two major ( barotropic and baroclinic ) regimes of atmospheric circulation is an important one in `` geophysical '' fluid dynamics .",
    "for instance , both regimes are relevant to the earth s atmosphere and critical to our understanding of its general circulation , with a baroclinic ( lower - level ) troposphere and a barotropic ( higher - level ) stratosphere .",
    "various factors contribute to the degree of baroclinicity / barotropicity of an atmospheric flow .",
    "the more stably - stratified an atmosphere is ( i.e. the more `` radiative '' it is , as opposed to convective , to use the language of stellar physics ) , the larger its external rossby deformation radius is , the weaker baroclinic instability growth is and thus the more barotropic the circulation regime will be ( e.g. pedlosky 1987 ; cho et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the strong external irradiation experienced by hot jupiter atmospheres creates rather strongly - stratified temperature profiles in their photospheric regions ( e.g. seager & sasselov 1998 ; sudarsky et al .",
    "2000 ; iro et al . 2005 ; barman et al .",
    "2005 ; fortney & marley 2007 ) .",
    "this relative vertical stability , together with slow ( synchronized ) rotation and high atmospheric temperatures , leads to large external rossby deformation radii @xcite and favors a barotropic circulation regime ( with vertically aligned horizontal motions in the various atmospheric layers ) .",
    "the lack of surface drag on the atmospheric flow , for otherwise identical forcing conditions , also favors a barotropic regime as horizontal shear tends to inhibit the development of baroclinic instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for all these reasons , a single - layer , vertically - integrated barotropic treatment of horizontal motions in hot jupiter atmospheres may be justified @xcite .    since the distinction between barotropic and baroclinic regimes depends on the degree of atmospheric vertical stratification , which is known for the earth but _ a priori _ unknown for remote exoplanets , the results from our shallow hot jupiter model should only be interpreted as suggestive that this regime is relevant to hot jupiter atmospheric flows . a more systematic exploration of circulation regimes on hot jupiters will be needed to address this issue more thoroughly .",
    "the shallow hot jupiter model presented here is rather specific and idealized in a number of important ways .",
    "for instance , adopted values for the profile of relaxation temperatures and the radiative relaxation time are rather arbitrary .",
    "the presence of deeper atmospheric layers and their interaction with the modeled layers has also been ignored in this shallow model .",
    "nevertheless , the model may capture important dynamical features of the atmospheric flow on hot jupiters .",
    "in particular , the simulated flow has a number of similarities with comparable results reported in the literature , together with noticeable differences .",
    "as we have already emphasized , our simulated flow is characterized by a broad , zonally - perturbed superrotating equatorial wind , large scale polar vortices , unsteadiness and subsonic wind speeds .",
    "the emergence of a super - rotating ( eastward equatorial ) wind in this hemispherically - forced flow is consistent with the results of .",
    "the broad width of this equatorial wind and the presence of counter - jets at midlatitudes is also consistent with the specific results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite , however , the typically opposite ( westward ) direction of the equatorial wind that emerges in equivalent - barotropic simulations may point to some limitation of that approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong zonal disturbances of the equatorial wind in our model is very reminiscent of a similar pattern of large - amplitude rossby waves discussed by cho et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2008 ; see also langton & laughlin 2007 ) .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the zonally - symmetric equatorial flow reported by . as fig .",
    "[ fig : seven ] illustrates , these zonal disturbances of the equatorial wind are closely related to the flow unsteadiness observed in our model ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while our shallow hot jupiter flow exhibits large - scale polar vortices , their dynamical nature is quite distinct from that of the circumpolar vortices discussed by @xcite .",
    "the polar vortices shown in fig .  [ fig : seven ] , for instance , are anti - cyclonic , not geostrophically - balanced and consistently located on the planetary night - side , somewhat eastward of the anti - stellar point .",
    "this is in contrast with the geostrophically - balanced , cyclonic polar vortices that exhibit systematic longitudinal translations in the equivalent - barotropic flows described by @xcite .",
    "we interpret this difference as being due to the forcing - dominated nature of polar vortices in our hot jupiter model , which starts at rest , rather than a dynamical origin like in the flows of @xcite , where polar vortices emerge from turbulent initial conditions subject to an energy cascade to large scales under the constraint of potential vorticity conservation ( see @xcite for a discussion ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , even though our simulated flow is clearly unsteady ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : seven ] ) , a possible consequence of the different nature of polar vortices in the present shallow hot jupiter model could be a reduced level of disk - integrated variability , from less dynamically active polar vortices , by comparison to what equivalent - barotropic results have indicated so far @xcite .",
    "an important difference between our results and several comparable studies reported in the literature is the consistently subsonic value of wind speeds in our shallow hot jupiter model . in this respect ,",
    "our results stand out by comparison with those of .",
    "it is presently unclear what is the origin of this fundamental discrepancy .",
    "we simply note here that one element of answer might be the emergence of barotropic ( horizontal shear ) instabilities in our shallow model , which appear to result from the acceleration of the equatorial wind and its flank counterjets and could possibly limit the asymptotic wind speeds in our model",
    ". more work , including model inter - comparisons , is needed to clarify this point .",
    "the magnitude of wind speeds on hot jupiters is an open problem . unlike the atmospheres of terrestrial planets ,",
    "giant planet atmospheres lack the large - scale sink of energy and momentum that is associated with friction on a solid surface . as a result ,",
    "the only sources and sinks of energy and momentum in a hot jupiter flow as simulated here are the newtonian relaxation , which represents large - scale sources and sinks of radiation , and the hyperdissipation , which operates on small scales .",
    "the absence of a clearly identified large - scale sink of energy ( ground friction ) makes giant planet atmospheres possibly more difficult to understand than their terrestrial counterparts .",
    "indeed , dissipation in the flow , which ultimately determines asymptotic wind speeds , is then more strongly dependent on the flow itself , via its large - scale coupling to radiation and its effective turbulent dissipation on small scales .",
    "@xcite has recently suggested that internal friction between atmospheric layers could play an important role in the hot jupiter context .",
    "the large variety of flow behaviors found so far in distinct hot jupiter studies suggests that , in addition to model validations such as our simple earth - like model , inter - comparisons of hydrodynamic solvers on identical , well - defined atmospheric circulation problems may be necessary to build a solid understanding of these new circulation regimes .",
    "the shallow hot jupiter model presented here could be used as a first step in this direction .",
