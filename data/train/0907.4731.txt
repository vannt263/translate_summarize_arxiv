    "measurements of elliptic flow at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) indicate based on comparisons with ideal hydrodynamics calculations that the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions is a nearly perfect liquid @xcite .",
    "a measure of fluidity is provided by the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "calculations based on super - symmetric gauge theories @xcite and uncertainty principle @xcite suggest a lower bound , @xmath5 .",
    "elliptic flow has been the basic experimental probe for the estimation of @xmath4 .",
    "based on recent measurements of elliptic flow and comparison with hydro models , the estimated range is @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the matter produced in @xmath7 collisions is indeed a low viscosity medium @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we present preliminary results of an alternative technique to determine the medium viscosity .",
    "the technique , proposed by gavin _ et .",
    "@xcite , relies on measurements of the collision centrality evolution of transverse momentum two - particle correlation functions .",
    "this @xmath4 is estimated based on the longitudinal broadening of the correlations with increasing collision centrality .",
    "the broadening arises from longitudinal diffusion of momentum currents .",
    "it is quantitatively determined by the magnitude of the kinematic viscosity , @xmath8 ( where ",
    "t \" stands for temperature ) , and the lifetime of the colliding system .",
    "we use differential extensions of the integral correlation observable @xmath9 proposed by gavin _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite .",
    "+ we present measurements of @xmath9 and inclusive ( @xmath10 ) as a function of the relative pseudorapidity and azimuthal angles of the measured particles .",
    "the observable @xmath9 is defined as @xmath11 and _ inclusive _ is defined as @xmath12    @xmath13 represents the number of particles detected in an event @xmath14 at pseudorapidity @xmath15 and azimuthal angle @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 stands for the transverse momentum of the @xmath18 particle in an event @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath19 is the average of the particle transverse momentum at @xmath15 and @xmath16 over the whole event ensemble .",
    "this analysis is based on data recorded using the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector during the 2004 data rhic run at brookhaven national laboratory . @xmath7",
    "collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev were acquired with minimum bias triggers @xcite .",
    "this analysis is restricted to charged particle tracks from the star - time projection chamber ( tpc ) in the momentum range 0.2 @xmath20 2.0 gev / c within the pseudorapidity acceptance of @xmath211.0 .",
    "a nominal cut of distance of closest approach ( dca @xmath22 3.0 cm ) was applied in order to limit the selected tracks to primary charged particle tracks only .",
    "an event was accepted for analysis if its collision vertex lay within @xmath2325 cm , where @xmath24 stands for the maximum distance along the beam axis from the center of the tpc .",
    "the results reported here are based on 10 million minbias events .",
    "we define centrality based on primary tracks within @xmath211.0 .",
    "centrality bins are calculated as a fraction of the total multiplicity distribution .",
    "figures 1(a , c ) and ( b , d ) show a comparison of @xmath25 and @xmath9 correlations functions for 70 - 80% & 0 - 5% centrality , respectively , in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev . the correlation function is plotted as a function of the particles relative pseudorapidity , @xmath26 , and azimuthal angles , @xmath27 , using 31 and 36 bins , respectively .",
    "the two observables exhibit a ridge - like structure in the most central collisions ( 0 - 5% ) which is narrow in azimuth ( near @xmath26 = 0 ) and extended over particles relative pseudorapidity , @xmath26 . in peripheral collisions",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath25 feature a near - side peak centered at @xmath28=0 , and a broad away - side ( @xmath29 ) ridge .",
    "the near side peak broadens progressively with centrality reaching a maximum in the most central collisions while the away - side amplitude progressively decreases from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "the @xmath25 exhibits a single near - side peak structure whereas @xmath9 features a dip near @xmath30 .",
    "the cause of this dip is under investigation .",
    "we assume in this analysis that the broadening of the correlation function @xmath9 in @xmath31 is solely due to viscous diffusion effects and proceed to determine the evolution of the @xmath31 width with collision centrality .",
    "this is accomplished by fitting the @xmath31 projections of @xmath9 in the range @xmath321.0 radians .",
    "figures 2(a , c ) and ( b , d ) show @xmath31 projections for @xmath321.0 radians for @xmath25 and @xmath9 correlations functions for peripheral ( 70 - 80% ) and central ( 0 - 5% ) collisions , respectively .",
    "we parameterize the projections with a 5-component model .",
    "a wide gaussian approximates the overall shape of the correlation function .",
