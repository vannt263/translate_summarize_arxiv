    "in this paper , a _ network _ is a directed acyclic multigraph @xmath0 , some of whose nodes are information sources or receivers ( e.g.  see @xcite ) . associated with the sources",
    "are @xmath1 generated _ messages _ , where the @xmath2 source message is assumed to be a vector of @xmath3 arbitrary elements of a fixed finite alphabet , @xmath4 , of size at least @xmath5 . at any node in the network ,",
    "each out - edge carries a vector of @xmath6 alphabet symbols which is a function ( called an _ edge function _ ) of the vectors of symbols carried on the in - edges to the node , and of the node s message vectors if it is a source .",
    "each network edge is allowed to be used at most once ( i.e.  at most @xmath6 symbols can travel across each edge ) .",
    "it is assumed that every network edge is reachable by some source message .",
    "associated with each receiver are one or more _ demands _ ; each demand is a network message .",
    "each receiver has _ decoding functions _ which map the receiver s inputs to vectors of symbols in an attempt to produce the messages demanded at the receiver .",
    "the goal is for each receiver to deduce its demanded messages from its in - edges and source messages by having information propagate from the sources through the network .",
    "a @xmath7 _ fractional code _ is a collection of edge functions , one for each edge in the network , and decoding functions , one for each demand of each node in the network .",
    "a @xmath7 _ fractional solution _ is a @xmath7 fractional code which results in every receiver being able to compute its demands via its decoding functions , for all possible assignments of length-@xmath3 vectors over the alphabet to the @xmath2 source message , for all @xmath8 .",
    "special codes of interest include _ linear codes _ , where the edge functions and decoding functions are linear , and _ routing codes _ , where the edge functions and decoding functions simply copy specified input components to output components .",
    "special networks of interest include _ multicast _ networks , where there is only one source node and every receiver demands all of the source messages , and _ multiple - unicast _ networks , where each network message is generated by exactly one source node and is demanded by exactly one receiver node .    for each @xmath8",
    ", the ratio @xmath9 can be thought of as the rate at which source @xmath8 injects data into the network .",
    "if a network has a @xmath7 fractional solution over some alphabet , then we say that @xmath10 is an _ achievable rate vector _ , and we define the _ achievable rate region _ of the network as the following convex hull or without the convex hull . ]",
    "@xmath11 every vector in the achievable rate region can be effectively achieved by time - sharing between two achievable points ( since it is a convex combination of those achievable points ) .",
    "determining the achievable rate region of an arbitrary network appears to be a formidable task .",
    "alternatively , certain scalar quantities that reveal information about the achievable rates are typically studied . for any @xmath7 fractional solution ,",
    "we call the scalar quantity @xmath12 an _ achievable average rate _ of the network .",
    "we define the _ average coding capacity _ of a network to be the supremum of all achievable average rates , namely @xmath13 similarly , for any @xmath7 fractional solution , we call the scalar quantity @xmath14 an _ achievable uniform rate _ of the network . we define the _ uniform coding capacity _ of a network to be the supremum of all achievable uniform rates , namely @xmath15 note that for any @xmath16 and @xmath17 , if each component of @xmath18 is nonnegative , rational , and less than or equal to the corresponding component of @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then @xmath23 , which implies @xmath24 in other words , all messages can be restricted to having the same dimension @xmath25 when considering @xmath26 . also , note that @xmath27 the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath26 are attained by points on the boundary of @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that not every network has a uniform coding capacity which is an achievable uniform rate @xcite .",
    "if a network s edge functions are restricted to purely routing functions , then we write the capacities as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and refer to them as the _ average routing capacity _ and _ uniform routing capacity _ , respectively . likewise , for solutions using only linear edge functions , we write @xmath32 and @xmath33 and refer to them as the _ average linear capacity _ and _ uniform linear capacity _ , respectively .    given random variables @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we write @xmath36 to mean that @xmath35 are deterministic functions of @xmath34 .",
    "we say that @xmath34 _ yield _ @xmath35 .    in this paper , we study four specific networks , namely the generalized butterfly network , the fano network , the non - fano network , and the vmos network .",
    "the last three of these networks were shown to be matroidal in @xcite and various capacities of these networks have been computed .",
    "however , the full achievable rate regions of these networks have not been previously determined , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "some other work on achievable rates and capacities has been done in  @xcite .",
    "the generalized butterfly network ( studied in section  [ sec : butterfly ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : generalized - butterfly ] ) has the same topology as the usual butterfly network @xcite , but instead of one source at each of nodes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , there are two sources at each of these nodes . for each of the source nodes , one of it s source messages",
    "is demanded by receiver @xmath39 and the other by receiver @xmath40 .",
    "the usual butterfly network is the special case when messages @xmath41 and @xmath42 do not exist ( or are just not demanded by any receiver ) .",
    "a large majority of network coding publications mention in some context the butterfly network , so it plays an important role in the field .    the fano network ( studied in section  [ sec : fano ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : fano - network ] ) and the non - fano network ( studied in section  [ sec : non - fano ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : non - fano - network ] )",
    "were used in @xcite as components of a larger network to demonstrate the unachievability of network coding capacity .",
    "specifically , in @xcite the fano network was shown to be solvable if and only if the alphabet size is a power of @xmath5 and the non - fano network was shown to be solvable if and only if the alphabet size is odd . in @xcite , the fano and non - fano networks",
    "were used to build a solvable multicast network whose reverse ( i.e. all edge directions change , and sources and receivers exchange roles ) was not solvable , in contrast to the case of linear solvability , where reversals of linearly solvable multicast networks were previously known to be linearly solvable @xcite . in @xcite , the fano and non - fano networks were used to construct a network which disproved a previously published conjecture asserting that all solvable networks are vector linearly solvable over some finite field and some vector dimension .",
    "the vmos network ( studied in section  [ sec : vamos ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : vamos - network ] ) was used in @xcite to demonstrate that non - shannon - type information inequalities could yield upper bounds on network coding capacity which are tighter than the tightest possible bound theoretically achievable using only shannon - type information inequalities . here",
    "we completely determine the routing and linear rate regions for the vmos network , but only give partial results for the non - linear rate region ( which indicate that it could be quite complicated ) .    finally , we present a new method for proving bounds on achievable rate regions for linear coding , which actually produces explicit linear rank inequalities which directly imply the desired bounds .",
    "the achievable rate regions for either linear or non - linear coding are the same for the generalized butterfly network and are equal to the closed polytope in @xmath43 whose faces lie on the @xmath44 planes : @xmath45 and whose vertices are the @xmath46 points : @xmath47 furthermore , the coding capacity and linear coding capacity are given by : @xmath48 [ thm:1 ]    consider a network solution over an alphabet @xmath4 and denote the source message dimensions by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and the edge dimensions by @xmath6 .",
    "let each source be a random variable whose components are independent and uniformly distributed over @xmath4 .",
