    "the properties of magnetic impurities in a metal is one of the most intensively studied problems in solid state physics .",
    "the work of friedel @xcite and anderson @xcite laid the foundation to understand why some transition - metal impurities form a local magnetic moment while others do nt .",
    "kondo @xcite showed that multiple scattering of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity yields a divergent contribution to the resistance in perturbation theory .",
    "kondo s paper stimulated a large body of theoretical and experimental work which changed our understanding of d- and f - impurities completely ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a large number of sophisticated methods were applied in the following three decades to better understand and solve the kondo and friedel - anderson problems . in particular",
    ", it was shown that at zero temperature the friedel - anderson impurity is in a non - magnetic state . to name a few of these methods : scaling @xcite , renormalization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite fermi - liquid theory @xcite , @xcite , slave - bosons",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , large - spin limit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after decades of research exact solutions of the kondo and friedel - anderson impurities were derived with help of the bethe - ansatz @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , representing a magnificent theoretical achievement .",
    "the experimental and theoretical progress has been collected in a large number of review articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the most controversial aspects of the kondo ground state is the so - called kondo cloud within the radius @xmath0 where @xmath0 is called the kondo length @xmath1 ( @xmath2 = kondo energy , @xmath3 = fermi velocity of the s - electrons ) .",
    "the idea is to divide the ground state @xmath4 of a kondo impurity into two parts with opposite d - spins .",
    "( by reversing all spins one can transform one component into the other one . )",
    "the proponents of the kondo cloud argue that in each component there is an s - electron within the kondo sphere which compensates the d - spin .",
    "this s - electron forms a singlet state with the d - spin .",
    "an important assumption of the kondo - cloud proponents is that , above the kondo temperature , the bond is broken and this screening cloud evaporates from the kondo sphere .    already in the 1970 s",
    "there were a number of theoretical papers with different predictions about the kondo cloud which stimulated several experimental investigations .",
    "in most of the experiments nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) was used , for example in cu samples with dilute fe - kondo impurities .",
    "( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite which contains also an overview of the theoretical predictions at that time ) . by applying a magnetic field ( small enough so that it does not destroy the kondo singlet state )",
    "nmr was used to measure the electron spin polarization at shells of cu atoms around the fe impurity . the line shift ( adjusted with the temperature dependent susceptibility of the fe impurity )",
    "did not show any change when the temperature crossed the kondo temperature .",
    "this contradicted the concept that , in the kondo ground state , the d - impurity was paired with and screened by an s - electron which evaporates above the kondo temperature .    in recent theoretical papers",
    "the argument is made that an nmr experiment can not possibly detect the screening electron because of the large volume of the kondo sphere . with a radius of the order of @xmath5 ( or larger ) the kondo sphere contains more than @xmath6 atoms .",
    "then the kondo cloud is only a faint kondo fog .",
    "it is spread so thinly that the change of polarization felt by an individual cu atom can not be detected in an nmr experiment .",
    "actually the experimental side has not improved so far but a number of theoretical suggestions have been published since 2000 which propose to observe the kondo cloud in sub - micron structures , in particular in connection with quantum dots @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . a number of these papers also contain numerical renormalization calculation to obtain the correlation functions between the impurity spin and the spin of the conduction electrons .    in this paper",
    "i calculate quantitatively the screening cloud of a friedel - anderson and a kondo impurity in the magnetic and the singlet state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the theoretical background of this paper will be introduced , the fair method . in section 3 the numerical results for the spatial density of the s - electrons",
    "will be reported and discussed for several cases .",
    "first the spatial extent of the simple friedel d - resonance with spinless electrons is discussed .",
    "since the physics of the friedel impurity is simple this consideration will give us confidence in the use of the wilson wave functions .",
    "in the next step the electronic environment of the friedel - anderson ( * fa * ) impurity is investigated .",
    "the calculation is first performed for its magnetic state .",
    "the latter represents the magnetic building block of the singlet ground state of the fa - impurity which is investigated next .",
    "last , but not least , the ground state of the kondo hamiltonian is analyzed .",
    "the subtle modification between the magnetic and the singlet ground state is discussed .",
    "section 4 contains the conclusion . in the appendix details of the fair states and the wilson states",
    "are presented , including the wave functions of the wilson states and their density in real space . @xmath7",
    "to investigate the question of a kondo cloud i first consider a friedel - anderson impurity with spin 1/2 in a metal host .",

    "i briefly describe the development of a very compact solution for the magnetic state and the singlet state .",
    "it uses two localized s - states @xmath13 and @xmath14 as artificial friedel resonance states or * fair * states ( friedel artificially inserted resonance states ) .",
    "the ground state solutions in terms of the fair basis have been studied in recent years for the friedel hamiltonian @xcite , @xcite , the magnetic and the singlet state of the friedel - anderson hamiltonian @xcite , @xcite and the kondo hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "the only difference is that the state @xmath15 opens a wide playing field for optimization : ( i ) the fair states @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be individually optimized , each one defining a whole basis @xmath19 ( which yields a hamiltonian of the form in fig.10a in the appendix ) and ( ii ) the coefficients @xmath20 can be optimized as well , fulfilling only the normalization condition @xmath21 .",
    "this yields a good treatment of the correlation effects .",
    "the optimization procedure is described in detail in ref .",
    "the state is denoted as the ( potentially ) magnetic state @xmath15 .",
    "it is expected to be a good solution above the kondo temperature .",

    "however , this state with broken symmetry is degenerate .",
    "its counterpart with reversed spins has the same energy , and at zero temperature the two form a new symmetric state which has a different symmetry than original one .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to an atom in a harmonic potential .",
    "if some process transforms the harmonic potential into a double well potential the symmetry is broken .",
    "although the atom has now an energy minimum on the left or right side its atomic wave function creates a new symmetric state by forming a symmetric superposition of left and right occupation .    in a similar way i use the magnetic state as a building block for the singlet ground state . @xmath15 together with its counterpart  where all spins are reversed yield two states @xmath23 and @xmath24 the singlet ground state is then given by @xmath25@xmath26   \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}a_{i-\\downarrow}^{\\ast}\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}a_{i+\\uparrow}^{\\ast}\\phi _ { 0}\\label{psi_ss}\\\\ &   + \\left [   \\overline{\\overline{a_{s , s}}}a_{0+\\downarrow}^{\\ast}a_{0-\\uparrow } ^{\\ast}+\\overline{\\overline{a_{d , s}}}a_{0+\\downarrow}^{\\ast}d_{\\uparrow } ^{\\ast}+\\overline{\\overline{a_{s , d}}}d_{\\downarrow}^{\\ast}a_{0-\\uparrow } ^{\\ast}+\\overline{\\overline{a_{d , d}}}d_{\\downarrow}^{\\ast}d_{\\uparrow}^{\\ast } \\right ]   \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}a_{i+\\downarrow}^{\\ast}\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}a_{i-\\uparrow}^{\\ast}\\phi_{0}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( if all spin up states are moved to the left the plus sign applies ) .",
    "the bars on top of @xmath15 are supposed to point out that all the parameters such as @xmath27 and @xmath20 have to be newly optimized .",
    "the resulting ground state is a very good approximation for the exact ground state .",
    "its ground - state energy and the d - occupations for zero , one and two d - electrons at the impurity are of the same quality as the best numerical calculations in the field @xcite .    in the numerical construction of the fair ground state",
    "the states @xmath28 is rotated in the @xmath29-dimensional hilbert space until the energy expectation value reaches its minimum .",
    "each time one has to construct the other states of the basis @xmath30 so that they are orthonormal and non - interacting .",
    "this can not be done with @xmath31 electron states .",
    "therefore we follow wilson in constructing a reduced basis , in our case with generally @xmath32 wilson states .",
    "the definition of the wilson states , their properties and in particular their wave function in real space is discussed in the appendix .",
    "i start the analysis with the friedel resonance of a spinless d - impurity .",
    "since the friedel hamiltonian is a single particle hamiltonian which can be solved exactly , one is here on familiar ground and the interpretation of the results will guide us in the less known territory of the friedel - anderson and the kondo impurity .",
    "given is the @xmath33-particle free electron state @xmath34 in terms of wilson states .",
    "a ( spinless ) friedel d - impurity is introduced at the position @xmath35 .",
    "this impurity has an s - d - interaction with the states @xmath36 due to the impurity the @xmath33-electron state @xmath37 is modified .",
    "as discussed in the appendix the exact ground state of the friedel impurity can be written as @xmath38 the composition of the fair state @xmath39 and the coefficients @xmath40 are obtained by an iteration process in which the fair state is rotated in hilbert space into its optimal orientation .",
    "details of this iteration process and the construction of the full ground state have been described in previous papers @xcite , @xcite .    in the next step",
    "we have to calculate the integrated electron density in the presence of the friedel d - impurity at the origin .",
    "this calculation is discussed in the appendix .",
    "the density of the state @xmath41 is given by@xmath42 for @xmath43 in the evaluation we use @xmath32 wilson states . from the above equation",
    "one recognizes that the density @xmath44 of the state @xmath45 lies roughly in the interval between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( in units of @xmath48 ) . since for negative energies",
    "@xmath49 takes the values from @xmath50to @xmath51 the different wave functions @xmath52 have very different spatial ranges and therefore very different densities , the lowest being of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore one has to be careful in the summation of the different contributions .    in the numerical evaluation",
    "we calculate ( i ) the s - electron density in the presence and absence of the d - impurity , ( ii ) form the net s - electron density @xmath54 as the difference , ( iii ) integrate the net s - electron density from @xmath35 to @xmath55 where @xmath55 is increased on an exponential scale , @xmath56 and plot the net integrated s - electron density versus @xmath57 .",
    "this net integrated density @xmath58 is plotted in fig.1 as a function of the distance from the impurity .",
    "the full triangles and circles  give the integrated net s - electron density for the two components @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the ground state , and the squares for the full ground state @xmath61 . the curve for @xmath62 increases from @xmath63 to @xmath64 roughly between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "around @xmath67 it drops back to zero .",
    "it has to return to zero because the total number of occupied states in @xmath62 is the same as before in the state @xmath68 i.e.  equal to @xmath69 .",
    "the equivalent distance @xmath70 corresponds roughly to the maximum range of the wave functions . in a way it can be considered as the border or surface of the theoretical sample .",
    "therefore the interpretation of this curve in fig.1 is that in the state @xmath62 a fraction of @xmath64 electrons has moved from the surface towards the d - impurity .",
    "there it surrounds the empty d - state in the spatial region between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "( the component @xmath62 has no d - electron ) .",
    "the behavior of the integrated net density beyond about @xmath73 is a surface effect and of no interest for the present investigation . if one increases the number of cells from @xmath29 to @xmath74 then this part of the curve moves  by @xmath75 to the right while the left part of the curve remains unchanged .",
    "the full circles in fig.1 give the change of the net integrated density of s - electrons for the state @xmath76 as a function of distance . at large distances ( @xmath77 )",
    "it approaches the value @xmath78 because this state has only @xmath51 s - electrons . between the distances",

    "if one adds to the integrated s - electron density the one d - electron at the origin then one obtains the dotted curve which starts on the left at one and approaches zero at large distances .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the range @xmath80 the total integrated density of d- and s - electrons is equal to @xmath64 for both wave functions @xmath62 and @xmath76 .",
    "this means both components have accumulated the same charge close to the impurity . as discussed below this corresponds to a friedel phase shift of @xmath81 .    in this specific example",
    "the parameters of @xmath82 and @xmath83 were chosen so that the occupation numbers take the values @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ". then the net integrated density of @xmath62 times the occupation number @xmath86 yields @xmath87 and just cancels the corresponding product of @xmath64*@xmath88 for the state @xmath76 . as a result the total integrated density of s - electrons as a function of distance from the impurity vanishes as the curve for @xmath61 shows ( full squares ) .",
    "there is no change of s - electron density about the impurity . on the other hand",
