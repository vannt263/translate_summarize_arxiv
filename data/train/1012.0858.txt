    "jet quenching or suppression of high @xmath5 jets and di - jets is one of the most intensely studied probes of the strongly - interaction quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) created in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "since the suppression level is directly caused by the interaction of the jets with the medium , jet quenching measurements allow us to infer the properties of the sqgp . after nearly a decade",
    "long effort , jet quenching , as an experimental phenomena , has been firmly established at rhic . however , the exact mechanism for jet quenching is still under intense debate .",
    "the often - used pertubative qcd ( pqcd ) framework , which works well in elementary p+p collisions , fail to describe simultaneously the light and heavy quark suppression .",
    "in contrast , non - perturbative approaches , for example those based on ads / cft gauge gravity duality  @xcite , seem to work well . even within the pqcd framework , there are many models that are based on different and often uncontrolled approximations  @xcite , which , when tuned to the same data , predict very different medium properties .",
    "one way to improve the situation is to study multiple jet quenching observables at once , capitalizing on their different sensitivities to the energy loss mechanism .",
    "these observables include single hadron suppression @xmath0 and its azimuthal anisotropy relative to the reaction plane ( rp ) @xmath6 or @xmath1 , di - hadron suppression @xmath2 and its azimuthal anisotropy relative to the rp @xmath7 or @xmath3 , as well as modifications of electron - hadron correlation , @xmath4-hadron correlations and fully reconstructed jets .",
    "the idea is to fix the energy loss mechanism , while dramatically varying the path length that the probes transverse , for example by comparing @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 for light hadrons ; or fix the path length and vary the interaction between jet and medium , for example by comparing di - hadron and electron - hadron correlations . the goal of this proceedings is to summarize recent phenix results on all these observables , and discuss the physics insights obtained by combining these results .",
    "reader should refer to  @xcite for a theoretical review on this subject .",
    "single hadron suppression @xmath0 is the most studied observable for jet quenching . due to the steeply falling spectrum , this",
    "observable suffers from energy loss bias ( observed hadron tends to have small energy loss ) , which limits its ability in distinguishing various model scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , as the @xmath0 measurements become more precise , one can regain some discriminating power .",
    "for example , recent precision measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons have started to pin down the shape of the @xmath0 at high @xmath5 .",
    "this is important for understanding the energy loss mechanism .",

    "for example , the quadratic @xmath22 dependence formula for radiative energy loss , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is participant density ) , may need to be changed to increase the anisotropy .",
    "there are three ideas along this line of reasoning .",
    "liao and shuryak  @xcite do this by requiring that most of the energy loss in sqgp be concentrated around @xmath25 .",
    "one can increase the @xmath1 by increasing the formation time @xmath26 to @xmath27 fm/@xmath21  @xcite .",
    "one can also increase the @xmath1 with a cubic @xmath22 dependence of energy loss : @xmath28 ; such dependence is expected in certain non - perturbative energy loss calculations based on ads / cft gravity - gauge dual theory  @xcite . indeed , fig .  [",

    "furthermore , the constant level of @xmath2 becomes even less suppressed for higher trigger @xmath5 .",
    "this result can be explained , at least partially , by the bias of the away - side jet energy by the trigger @xmath5 : the initial away - side jet spectra are harder for higher trigger @xmath5 , consequentially , a larger fractional energy loss is required for the same @xmath2 value .",

    "non - photonic electron - hadron correlations provide valuable complementary information for heavy quark energy loss .",
    "this is because a large fraction of heavy quarks are produced in back - to - back pair at rhic energy , and the fragmentation of the companion heavy quark is expected to contribute significantly to away - side hadrons associated with triggering electrons .",

    "the enhancement of the associated hadron yield at low @xmath5 was observed in di - hadron correlations  @xcite , as a double hump structure centered around one radian from @xmath67 .",
    "however , the interpretation of this enhancement in terms of jet in - medium response , e.g. mach cone , is complicated by possible contributions of e - by - e collective flow fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that such fluctuations lead to significant non - zero @xmath68 and @xmath69 components which can mimic such double hump structure  @xcite . since the direct @xmath4 does not interact strongly with medium , it should have very small flow signal as indicated by phenix preliminary measurements on direct @xmath4 @xmath1 ( left panel of fig .",

    "<S> we review recent progresses on jet quenching measurements by phenix . with increased statistics , </S>",
    "<S> phenix has gone beyond the single hadron suppression @xmath0 , and made measurements on multiple jet quenching observables , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that , by combining these observables together , one can achieve a better understanding of the energy loss mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we present new @xmath4-hadron correlation results with associated hadrons extended to low @xmath5 ; an enhancement has been observed , suggesting a contribution of genuine medium response that is relatively unbiased by the initial geometry fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the status of full jet reconstruction and future perspective of phenix jet quenching program are discussed .    </S>",
