    "the problem of finding the ground state of a frustrated spin model having a complex energy landscape is , in general , an np - complete problem : the running time of exact algorithms increases at least exponentially with system size .",
    "there are , however , several new ground state techniques devised for specific examples which are able to calculate exact ground state in a polynomial time using elementary algorithms in combinatorial optimization , in particular network flows @xcite .",
    "this opened the route to the numerical study of very large system sizes for different problems , like spin - glasses @xcite , random field ising model @xcite , solid - on - solid model with a disordered substrate @xcite , superconducting flux line lattices @xcite , and many others . in the general case , where such particular algorithms are not known ,",
    "one is forced to use approximated methods .",
    "these consists in some kind of dynamic in the space of spin configurations which explores different states looking for the lowest energy value .",
    "the simplest choice is to consider some kind of monte carlo simulation at zero temperature ( deep quench ) which , starting from a random configuration , follows a random walk of decreasing energy till one ends up on a local energy minimum .",
    "one then repeats this procedure a number of time as large as possible and take as better estimate of ground state the lowest energy found .",
    "many variants and improvements have been proposed and among them the simulated annealing @xcite , which slowly cool the system from high temperature to zero temperature and parallel tempering , which uses several temperatures in parallel@xcite .",
    "which algorithm is most suitable depends on the nature of the problem ; for a recent paper , where the performances of these different monte carlo simulation techniques are compared , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "monte carlo dynamics , of one type or another , is _",
    "stochastic _ , i.e. for a given ( random ) initial configuration the trajectory is a random process . on the other hand , to find low - temperature states , one may also consider _ deterministic _ dynamics , which uniquely associates to a ( random ) initial spin configuration a final state according to some evolution rule .",
    "a simple question which naturally arises is the following : what kind of deterministic dynamic is most effective in finding the configurations of smallest energies ?",
    "while stochastic dynamic have been widely studied in literature , much less is known on statistical properties of deterministic dynamic .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on two of them : _ greedy _ and _ reluctant _ : both of them follows a one - spin - flip decreasing energy trajectory , the difference being that while in greedy dynamics the energy decreases of the largest possible amount , the reluctant algorithm makes moves corresponding to the smallest possible energy decrease .",
    "some of the properties of these two minimization algorithms were studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we push further the analysis addressing the following questions :    * for a given number of initial spin configurations which of the two dynamics is more efficient ? which one has the largest basin of attraction ? * for a given elapsed time which one is able to reach the lowest energy states ?    in order to answer these questions we considered two different models . for the sine model ( section 3 ) , where it is available an analytical knowledge of ground state for particular values of system sizes , we focus our attention on the capability of the two algorithms in detecting this ground state .",
    "for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model we present numerical results in section 4 , where the lowest energy found is studied with different parameters in the simulations .",
    "the outcome of the analysis is that while for a fixed number of initial spin configurations the reluctant dynamics works better as it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( there is a higher probability to find low energy configurations ) , when the elapsed running time is fixed the two algorithms gives basically the same results ( the time used for a single run grows linearly for the greedy algorithm and quadratically for the reluctant ) .",
    "a final test is also performed in a stochastic convex combination of the two algorithms : at each step the motion is greedy with probability @xmath0 and reluctant with probability @xmath1 .",
    "it is found that for large @xmath2 and for fixed running times a substantial improvement is obtained with a @xmath3 .",
    "we consider models defined by the hamiltonian h(j , ) = - _ i , j=1^n j_ij_i_j where @xmath4 for @xmath5 are ising spin variables and @xmath6 is an @xmath7 symmetric matrix which specifies interaction between them .",
    "the _ greedy _ and _ reluctant _ dynamics work as follow .",
    "the initial spin configuration at time @xmath8 is chosen at random with uniform probability .",
    "then the evolution rule is :    1 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the spin configuration at time @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   calculate the spectrum of energy change obtained by flipping the spin in position @xmath11 , for @xmath12 : e_i = _",
    "i(t)_j i j_ij _ j(t ) 3 .",
    "select the site @xmath13 associated with the lowest ( resp .",
    "highest ) of the _ negative _ energy change for the greedy ( resp .",
    "reluctant ) dynamic .",
    "i^_greed = \\ { i \\{1,  ,n } : e_i^ = _",
    "i \\{1,  ,n } \\ { e_i < 0 } } i^_reluc = \\ { i \\{1,  ,n } : e_i^ = _",
    "i \\{1,  ,n } \\ { e_i < 0 } } 4 .",
    "flip the spin on site @xmath13 : _",
    "i(t+1 ) = \\ { + ll -_i(t ) , & , + _",
    "i(t ) , & , + .",
    "both the dynamics follows an energy descent trajectory till they arrive to a @xmath14-spin - flip stable configuration , i.e. a configuration whose energy can not be decreased by a single spin - flip .",
    "these represent local minima in energy landscape at zero temperature with respect to a @xmath14-spin - flip dynamic .",
    "they are also solutions of the mean field tap equations at zero temperature @xcite : _ i = ( _ j i j_ij _ j )",
    "the first model we study is a mean - field system , having a very high degree of frustration even tough the bonds between spins are non random .",
    "it has been introduced by marinari , parisi and ritort in ref .",
    "the couplings are given by the orthogonal matrix associated with the discrete fourier transform : j_ij = ( ) the ground state of the model is not known for general values of the system size . however , as already noted in @xcite , for special values of @xmath2 the ground state can be explicitly constructed using number theory . indeed , for @xmath2 odd such that @xmath15 is prime of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an integer , let @xmath18 be the state given by the sequence of legendre symbols , i.e. ^l_i = ( ) = \\ {    ll + 1 , & , + -1 , & ,    . with @xmath19 .",
    "then , it s easy to verify ( see @xcite ) that [ gs ] h(^l)=-n2 which is , of course , the lowest value that energy can take due to the orthogonality of interaction matrix .",
    "the explicit knowledge of ground state for selected @xmath2 is a valuable bonus , since it allows a complete control of dynamical and statistical properties of the algorithms for quite large system sizes . in this section",
    "we restrict our analysis to such @xmath2 values for which we have an exact expression of ground state configuration as legendre symbols .",
    "the natural unit of time is the `` spin - flip '' time , i.e. the cycle during which the dynamic explores all the internal fields in such a way to decide which spin to flip . in this unit",
    "the time @xmath10 of a realization of the dynamic for a given initial condition is obtained by counting the number of `` spin flip '' necessary to reach a metastable configuration .",
    "we run greedy and reluctant dynamics for a large number @xmath20 of initial conditions , keeping track of the number of times @xmath21 we found the ground state as final configuration .",
    "we also measured the time of each realization @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the number of trials @xmath20 is an increasing function of the system size . for small sizes we stopped when we found the ground state @xmath24 times . for the largest size @xmath25 we used up to @xmath26 initial configurations , so that the ground state has been found at least @xmath27 times .",
    "we computed the following three quantities :    1 .",
    "the average relaxation time of the dynamic [ time ] = _",
    "i=1^m t_i 2 .   the estimated probability to find the ground state [ prob ] p_gs = 3 .   the average time to find the ground state [ av_time_gs ] t_gs =",
    "i=1^m t_i    which are obviously related by @xmath28 .    in fig .",
    "( [ seno - intrinsic ] ) we plot the average time of the dynamic to reach a metastable configuration .",
    "as one could expect the greedy dynamic is much faster , since it follows the most rapid path to decrease energy .",
    "the greedy average time is linear with the system size , while the reluctant dynamic has a characteristic time which increases as @xmath29 with @xmath30 .    in fig .",
    "( [ seno - prob ] ) we compare the probabilities of finding ground state for the two algorithms .",
    "these have been estimated empirically using formula ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "we always used a number of trials @xmath20 large enough to ensure the robustness of the statistical properties i.e. we increased @xmath20 until the estimated probabilities relaxed to an asymptotic value with negligible fluctuations .",
    "we can see that , apart from finite size effects for very small system sizes , both algorithms have an exponentially decreasing probability of finding the ground state .",
    "nevertheless the reluctant probability is a little bit larger which says that , for a given number of initial conditions , reluctant algorithm is more efficient in finding the ground state , i.e. it has a larger basin of attraction .",
    "this result agrees with the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , which using both algorithms with the same number of initial conditions obtained a better estimate of asymptotic value of energy ground state for sk model in the case of reluctant dynamic .    on the other hand , if one measures the average time to find a ground state , eq .",
    "( [ av_time_gs ] ) , which takes into account both the average time of dynamic and the probability of finding the ground state , one can see from fig ( [ seno - total ] ) that greedy algorithm requires a smaller time on average .",
    "this means that , from a practical point of view , for a given elapsed time greedy dynamic is slightly more efficient .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick model is the infinite range case for spin - glasses @xcite .",
    "the couplings @xmath6 are independent identically distributed symmetric gaussian random variables @xmath31 with zero mean and variance @xmath32 . since this is a disordered model one is interested in the quenched average ground state energy . for each @xmath2",
    "this is defined as : e^gs_n = ( _ h_n(j , ) ) where we denoted by @xmath33 the average over the couplings .",
    "analytical knowledge of this quantity is available in the thermodynamical limit @xmath34 using parisi ansatz for replica symmetry breaking theory : @xmath35 @xcite , while numerical simulations obtained using finite size scaling @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 @xcite .    the statistical analysis on the sine model revealed that , for a given number of initial conditions , reluctant dynamic works better than greedy to find the lower states in energy landscape .",
    "on the other hand , since the reluctant path is much longer than greedy , from a practical point of view , for a given elapsed time , it is slightly more efficient to make many quick greedy trials than a few slow reluctant runs . for the sk model",
    "it is not possible to perform the same analysis , because a complete control of the ground state is lacking and also it fluctuates from sample to sample . to check the conclusion of previous section we thus performed a series of numerical experiments varying control parameters .",
    "moreover we investigate the efficiency of a stochastic convex combination of the two algorithms : with probability @xmath39 we perform a greedy move and with probability @xmath1 the corresponding reluctant move . the deterministic dynamics are obtained at @xmath40 ( greedy ) and @xmath41 ( reluctant ) respectively .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath0 are stochastic dynamics where the greedy and reluctant moves are weighted by the probability @xmath0 .",
    "first of all we probed the average time of the dynamic for different values of @xmath0 using formula ( [ time ] ) , which is easily accessible to measurements and has good self - averaging properties .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ sk - intrinsic ] ) , together with the best numerical fits .",
    "note the progressive increase of the slope in log - log scale from an almost linear law for greedy ( bottom ) @xmath42 to an almost quadratic law for reluctant ( top ) @xmath43 .",
    "however an interesting result is that for @xmath3 we have still have @xmath44 , i.e. a stochastic algorithm which makes on average one greedy move ( and nine reluctant moves ) out of ten has a much smaller average time than the deterministic reluctant algorithm @xmath41 .",
    "we notice that the exponents for greedy ( resp .",
    "reluctant ) algorithm are very close to the integers 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) with an observed slow crossover between the two for intermediate @xmath45 . it would be interesting to have a theoretical understanding of this fenomenon even if only at a heuristic level .",
    "we plan to return over this problem in a future work .",
    "next we measured the lowest energy value found for a given number of initial conditions for different probability @xmath0 .",
    "one has to choose a protocol to fix the number of initial conditions .",
    "obviously , the larger the system size the bigger must be the number of trials .",
    "we tried different choices obtaining similar results . for the sake of space",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ sk - fix - init - cond ] ) the results of the run where we choose @xmath2 initial conditions for a system of size @xmath2 .",
    "the data have been averaged on @xmath46 disorder realizations .",
    "we see that the smaller is the probability of making greedy moves , the lower is the energy found .",
    "the best results is obtained for @xmath41 , which corresponds to deterministic reluctant dynamic .",
    "this confirms that , ignoring the total amount of time and imposing constrain only on the number of initial conditions , reluctant dynamic is the most efficient in reaching low energy states .",
    "finally we compared results of different probabilities in the case one considers a fixed elapsed time .",
    "as an example , we present results for an elapsed time of @xmath27 hours of cpu on a cray sp3 for @xmath2 in the range @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "we considered again @xmath46 disorder realizations and assigned the same time length to each sample ( @xmath48 minutes ) . obviously in this way",
    "reluctant dynamic starts from a smaller number of initial conditions than greedy , because its relaxation time is longer . in fig .",
    "[ sk - fix - elapsed ] we plot the values of the lowest energy state as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we can see from the data that , for a fixed elapsed time , greedy dynamic ( @xmath40 ) find lower energy states than reluctant ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "moreover we observe that the best result is obtained for @xmath3 .",
    "thus we suggest that the more power full strategy to find low energy state using greedy and reluctant dynamic is a combination of them , where most of the steps the move is reluctant and on a small fraction of steps ( say @xmath49 ) the move is greedy ."
