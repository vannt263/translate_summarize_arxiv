    "the proximity of our samples to the antiferromagnetic phase makes a spin density wave ( sdw ) gap the natural interpretation for our observations , consistent with arpes @xcite .",

    "we checked the @xmath15 sample homogeneity by electron microscopy analysis ( using the micron scale x - ray analysis of an edax system ) and found no dispersion at the micron scale in the pr , ce or cu concentrations .",
    "thin films are easy to anneal but , most important , they can be made superconducting in the underdoped regime , whereas this seems difficult for crystals @xcite .",
    "infrared - visible reflectivity spectra ( at an incidence angle of @xmath21 ) , were measured for all the films in the 2521000  @xmath22 spectral range with a bruker ifs-66v fourier transform spectrometer within an accuracy of 0.2% . typically 12 temperatures ( controlled better than 0.2 k ) were measured between 25 k and 300 k. the far - infrared frequency range ( 10100  @xmath22 ) was measured for samples ( ii ) and ( iii ) utilizing a bruker ifs-113v at brookhaven national laboratory .",
