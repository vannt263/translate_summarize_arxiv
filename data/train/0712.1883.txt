    "when one is dealing with classical field theories on a spacetime , the metric may appear as a given background field or it may be a genuine dynamic field satisfying the einstein equations .",
    "the latter theories are often generally covariant , with the spacetime diffeomorphism group as symmetry group , but the former often are considered to have only the isometry group of the metric as a symmetry group .",
    "however , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) indicated how theories with a background metric can be parametrized , that is , considered as theories that are fully covariant , if one introduces the diffeomorphisms themselves as dynamic fields .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop this idea in the context of multisymplectic classical field theory and to make connections with stress - energy - momentum ( `` sem '' ) tensors .",
    "as we shall see , the multimomenta conjugate to these new covariance fields form , to borrow a phrase from elasticity theory , the piola ",
    "kirchhoff version of the sem tensor , and their euler ",
    "lagrange equations are vacuously satisfied by virtue of the fact that the sem tensor is covariantly conserved .",
    "thus these fields have no physical content ; they serve only to provide an efficient way of parametrizing a field theory . nonetheless , the resulting generally covariant field theory has several attractive features , chief among which is that it is fully dynamic  all fields satisfy euler  lagrange equations .",
    "structurally , such theories are much simpler to analyze than ones with absolute objects or noncovariant elements .",
    "we emphasize that the results of this paper are for those field theories whose lagrangians are built from dynamic matter or other fields and a non - dynamic background metric .",
    "one of our motivations was to find a way to treat background fields and dynamic fields in a unified way in the context of the adjoint formalism .",
    "many of the ideas are applicable to a wider range of field theories , as @xcite already indicates , but in this paper we confine ourselves to this important class .",
    "the general case is presented in @xcite along with a more detailed discussion of parametrization theory and related topics .",
    "suppose that we have a metric field theory in which the metric is an absolute object in the sense of @xcite .",
    "for instance , one might consider a dynamic electromagnetic field propagating on a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "such a theory is not generally covariant , because the spacetime is fixed , and not all fields are on an equal footing , as the electromagnetic field is dynamic while the gravitational field is not .",
    "a somewhat different example is provided by nordstr@xmath0 m s theory of gravity ( see  17.6 of @xcite ) , which is set against a minkowskian background .    in this section",
    "we explain how to take such a system and construct from it an equivalent field theory that achieves the following goals :     ( i ) : :    the new field theory is generally covariant , and   ( ii ) : :    all fields in the new field theory are dynamic .",

    "lagrange equations for the covariance field @xmath35 are that the covariant divergence of the sem tensor density @xmath96 is zero .",
    "it is known from proposition 5 in @xcite that the sem tensor is covariantly conserved when the metric @xmath18 is the _ only _ nondynamic field .",
    "thus , in our context , the equation @xmath97 is an identity , whence    the euler  lagrange equations for the covariance field @xmath35 are vacuously satisfied .",
    "consequently the covariance field has no physical import .",
    "we are free to suppose @xmath35 is dynamic , and so we have accomplished goal ( ii ) : we have constructed a new field theory in which _ all _ fields are dynamic .",
    "it is interesting to compare the sem tensors for the original and parametrized systems . in @xcite",
    "the sem tensor density @xmath98 is defined in terms of fluxes of the multimomentum map @xmath99 associated to the action of the spacetime diffeomorphism group .",
    "we rapidly recount some of the basic ideas .",

    "the largest value of @xmath104 for which one of the top coefficients @xmath105 is nonzero is the differential index of the field theory .",
    "we assume henceforth that the index @xmath106the most common and important case ( e.g. , when the fields are all tensor fields ) .",
    "in this context , theorem 1 along with remark 4 of @xcite shows that the sem tensor density @xmath107 for a lagrangian density @xmath108 is uniquely determined by @xmath109 for all vector fields @xmath110 on @xmath3 with compact support and all hypersurfaces @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the inclusion .",
    "the multimomentum map @xmath113 gives , roughly speaking , the flow of momentum and energy through spacetime ; according to the quoted theorem , the fluxes of this flow across hypersurfaces are realized via the sem tensor density .",
    "manipulation of ( see formula ( 3.12 ) of @xcite ) shows that @xmath107 is given by @xmath114 where the summation extends over _ all _ fields @xmath115 .",
    "we apply this to the newly parametrized theory .",
    "note that if the index of the original theory is @xmath106 , then that for the parametrized theory will be also . as well from we see that the lift of @xmath116 to @xmath56 is trivial : @xmath117 that is , there are no terms in the @xmath118 directions in @xmath119 .",
    "thus the corresponding coefficients @xmath120 all vanish .",
    "the sem tensor for @xmath37 therefore reduces to @xmath121 on the other hand , @xmath122 and @xmath123 so that we can write @xmath124 but the first four terms on the rhs of this equation comprise the sem tensor density of the original theory since the @xmath125 do not derivatively couple to the @xmath49 ( cf .",

    "thus the sem tensor densities of the original and parametrized systems are related according to :    @xmath126    but then @xmath127 on shell by the hilbert formula .",
    "therefore , we explicitly see that the sem tensor density for the fully covariant , fully dynamic modified theory vanishes . one can also obtain this result directly by applying the generalized hilbert formula ( 3.13 ) in @xcite to the parametrized theory , since it is fully dynamic .",

    "thus , we obtain a modified _ second _ order field theory with the underlying bundle @xmath40 . )",
