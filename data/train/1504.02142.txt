    "the millimetre waveband contains two star formation tracers that directly trace photoionizing light from star forming regions while not suffering from dust obscuration effects , making it a superior alternative to star formation tracers in other wavebands ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the continuum emission includes free - free emission , and while thermal dust emission is dominant at @xmath7100  ghz and synchrotron emission is more prominent at @xmath830  ghz , free - free emission is the dominant emission source at 30 - 100  ghz ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "multiple hydrogen recombination lines are seen at millimetre wavelengths as well .",
    "optical and near - infrared lines are affected by dust extinction effects , and centimetre and metre recombination lines are affected by potential masing and collisional broadening effects , but millimetre lines are not affected by any of these problems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are therefore more accurate tracers of star formation .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) is a groundbreaking millimetre and submillimetre telescope with the capability of reaching sensitivity levels in the 30 - 950 ghz range at least an order of magnitude better than other telescopes ( see @xcite for a technical overview ) .",
    "alma is capable of detect free - free and recombination line emission from many nearby infrared - luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to use early alma observations to explore the telescope s capabilities to detect these star formation tracers .    in this paper",
    ", we present alma observations of free - free continuum emission and h40@xmath0 emission at 99.02  ghz from the centre of ngc  253 that we use to derive star formation rates ( sfrs ) as well as the electron temperature ( @xmath9 ) of the gas .",
    "in addition , we use the h40@xmath0 data together with near - infrared data from @xcite to examine the dust attenuation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite previously published analyses based on these data , but except for a brief mention of recombination lines in the latter paper , they focused on the molecular gas , whereas we will concentrate on the photoionized gas .",
    "radio and millimetre recombination lines have previously been detected from ngc  253 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this includes the detection of h40@xmath0 emission by @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis will focus on millimetre lines that are less susceptible to masing effects than most previous recombination line observations , which have been at lower frequencies .",
    "additionally , most of the continuum at the location of the h40@xmath0 line is free - free emission , allowing us to use the line and continuum data together to measure @xmath9 , whereas the lower frequency data are more affected by synchrotron emission .",
    "the alma data also have superior spatial resolutions , spectral resolutions , and sensitivities than most previously - published ngc  253 data .",
    "this ultimately serves as an example of the future work on extragalactic star formation in nearby galaxies that can be done with alma .",
    "the data were originally acquired as part of program 2011.0.00172.s and published by @xcite .",
    "the observations covering the h40@xmath0 line are from three execution blocks ( ebs ) performed on 07 may , 01 july , and 02 july 2012 .",
    "three locations along the major axis spaced by 25  arcsec were observed , and the total integration time per location was 29 min .",
    "only 14 - 20 antennas were operational .",
    "the spectral window covering the h40@xmath0 line was centered at a sky frequency of 98.54  ghz , contained 3840 channels each with a width of 488 khz ( 1.5 km  s@xmath2 ) , and included both polarisations .",
    "uranus was the flux calibrator , j2333 - 237 was the bandpass calibrator , and j0137 - 245 was the phase calibrator .",
    "we reprocessed the data using the common astronomy software applications version 4.2.2 , which includes a version of the flux calibration ( butler - jpl - horizons 2012 ) that is more up - to - date than the one used to create the data in the alma archive .",
    "the visibility data were processed through steps to flag bad data and to calibrate the phase and amplitude as a function of frequency and time .",
    "next , we rescaled the amplitudes of the visibility data so that the signal measured for j0137 - 245 in the individual execution blocks matched the weighted average of these values , and then we concatenated the data .",
    "we produced two versions of the image cube ( with and without continuum ) using a clean algorithm with natural weightings in an interactive mode .",
    "although the primary beam is 63  arcsec , we created image cubes covering a 32@xmath532  arcsec region ( with 0.1  arcsec pixels ) because no detectable emission is found outside this region .",
    "the cubes used in the analysis cover a sky frequency range between 98.80 and 99.09  ghz , and each channel in each cube covers 8 channels in the visibility data , which corresponds to 3.9  mhz ( @xmath611.8  km  s@xmath2 ) . for display purposes",
    ", we also produced a cube that covered 97.64 - 99.44  ghz , which was the full usable range of the spectral window containing the h40@xmath0 line , with the same spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the reconstructed beam is @xmath10  arcsec ; assuming a distance of @xmath11  mpc ( based on the average of distances measured by @xcite ) , this corresponds to spatial scales of @xmath12  pc .",
    "the flux calibration uncertainty reported in the alma technical handbook is 5% @xcite .",
    "the 98.54  ghz flux densities for the bandpass calibrator ( @xmath13  jy ) and the phase calibrator ( @xmath14  jy ) have relative uncertainties ( based on the variations in measurements from individual ebs ) that are consistent with the technical handbook , although unidentified systematic amplitude calibration effects could affect the flux densities . cleaned image cubes of the bandpass and phase calibrators show @xmath151% variations in the flux density from channel to channel , and no spectral features are seen at the position of the h40@xmath0 line in the visibility data for the calibration sources , which indicates that any line emission @xmath71% of the continuum emission is not caused by calibration issues .",
    "we had access to data from program 2011.0.00061.s ( pi : takano ) that also covers the h40@xmath0 line .",
    "because the spectral settings were different from program 2011.0.00172.s , we did not use the data in our analysis , but we did examine the processed archival data for program 2011.0.00061.s to confirm that the h40@xmath0 emission is detected in those data .",
    "h40@xmath0 fluxes , mean velocities ( relative to the solar system barycentre , and velocity fwhm were measured in the continuum - subtracted image cube , and the continuum at 99.02  ghz was measured in the other image cube by fitting and removing the line emission .",
    "images of the the continuum emission ( based on all continuum data within the spectral window ) , the h40@xmath0 flux , and the h40@xmath0 mean velocity are shown in figure  [ f_map ] .",
    "spectra integrated over the central @xmath16  arcsec as well as integrated within regions covering the three brightest regions are shown in figure  [ f_spec ] .",
    "details of the measurements in these regions are listed in table  [ t_spec ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the measurements incorporate the noise per channel values listed in table  [ t_spec ] , but except for the east ( e ) region , the accuracy in the continuum and h40@xmath0 fluxes is primarily limited by the calibration uncertainties .",
    "most of the signal outside the @xmath16  arcsec ellipse is detected at @xmath173@xmath18 , and we lack the _ uv _ coverage to recover @xmath720  arcsec structures .    the central star forming region can be divided into three knots that lie along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the central ( c ) and west ( w ) sources are detected at @xmath710@xmath18 in both the continuum and h40@xmath0 emission .",
    "the eastern source is detected at @xmath710@xmath18 in continuum emission as well , but the peak is only detected at the @xmath68@xmath18 level in h40@xmath0 emission . although all three sources had previous been detected in radio continuum emission @xcite , only @xcite had previously shown radio recombination line emission from all three sources .",
    "the same structure is also seen in the br@xmath19 image from @xcite , but the source is only marginally resolved and does not appear to show the same peak in recombination line emission .",
    "the h40@xmath0 emission from the central source is relatively broad ( with a fwhm of @xmath20  km s@xmath2 ) and appears to be rotating orthogonally to the plane of the galaxy , which is consistent with previous radio recombination line observations @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that material has recently fallen into the central region , that the central source comprises two superimposed photoionized regions , or that the ionized gas is in a superwind that is flowing in a direction aligned with the minor axis .",
    "it is unlikely that an active galactic nucleus is present , as the h40@xmath0 line would appear @xmath211000  km  s @xmath2 in width .",
    "we do not detect any asymmetry in the line emission from the central source as had been reported in some prior recombination line observations @xcite but not others .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unclear , although one possibility is that the line shapes differ because the lower - frequency lines are probing less dense gas than the h40@xmath0 line .",

    "+ @xmath23 these numbers are based on multiplying the measured continuum by @xmath24 to account for emission from sources other than free - free emission .    for determining the relative contribution of free - free emission to the 99.02  ghz continuum",
    ", the frequency coverage of the alma data by itself is insufficient for modelling the spectral energy distribution .",
    "@xcite indicate that most of the globally - integrated 99.02  ghz emission would be continuum .",
    "however , @xcite found a much smaller contribution of free - free emission to the central 30  arcsec , but they assumed that the slope of the synchrotron emission is fixed by the 5 and 15  ghz data points . if we instead repeat this fit but allow the slope of the synchrotron component to vary ( as shown in figure  [ f_sed ] , we find that @xmath25% of the 99.02  ghz emission is from free - free emission .",
    "we applied this correction to the measured continuum emission in the rest of our analysis .",

    "while it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore a more complex treatment of the attenuating medium , the comparison of @xmath46 values based on the attenuating sheet scenario still suggests that the attenuation measured by @xcite is too low by @xmath63 dex .",
    "the broader implications of these results are that near - infrared recombination line emission is heavily obscured in very dusty galaxies , including starbursts like ngc  253 as well as luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( galaxies with infrared luminosities @xmath7@xmath56  l@xmath4 ) .",

    "while these formulae are probably still accurate for many galaxies , these equations may need to be recalibrated for application to more dusty objects .",
    "using alma observations of free - free and h40@xmath0 emission at 99.02  ghz from the centre of ngc  253 , we obtain the following key results :    @xmath57  we measure @xmath9 of 3700 - 4500  k within the detected regions in the centre of the galaxy , which matches previous measurements within ngc  253 as is consistent with the range of values seen in the inner 8  kpc of the milky way .",

    "this measurement falls within the range of previously - published millimetre and radio results , which are inconsistent with each other , although our recombination line emission is detected at superior sensitivity levels , and our constraints on the relative contribution of free - free emission at millimetre wavelengths are more reliable .",
