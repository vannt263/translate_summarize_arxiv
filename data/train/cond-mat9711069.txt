    "one of the fundamental achievements of the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory of critical phenomena is the identification of universality classes in terms of the dimensionality @xmath9 of the system and the number @xmath10 of components of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "specifically , rg theory predicts that the critical exponents , certain amplitude ratios and scaling functions are universal quantities that do not depend , e.g. , on the strength of the interaction or on thermodynamic variables ( such as the pressure ) .",
    "the superfluid transition of @xmath11he belongs to the @xmath12 , @xmath13 universality class and provides a unique opportunity for an experimental test of the universality prediction by means of measurements of the critical behavior at various pressures @xmath14 along the @xmath15-line @xmath16 .",
    "early tests have been performed by ahlers and collaborators and consistency with the universality prediction was found within the experimental resolution @xcite . at a significantly higher level of accuracy ,",
    "the superfluid density and the specific heat ( or , equivalently , thermal expansion coefficient ) above and below @xmath16 are planned to be measured in the superfluid universality experiment ( sue ) @xcite under microgravity conditions or at reduced gravity in the low - gravity simulator @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated recently @xcite , this would allow to perform measurements up to @xmath17 in the reduced temperature @xmath18 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the corresponding challenge is to calculate as accurately as possible the properties of the o(@xmath10 ) symmetric @xmath3 model in three dimensions . to extract the leading critical exponents from the experimental data and to demonstrate their universality at a highly quantitative level requires detailed knowledge on the ingredients of a nonlinear rg analysis @xcite .",
    "they include not only the well - known rg exponent functions of the @xmath3 model whose fixed point values determine the critical exponents but also the less well - known amplitude functions @xcite which contain the information about universal ratios of leading and subleading amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical predictions on the critical exponents @xcite within the minimal subtraction scheme @xcite are based on field - theoretic calculations to five - loop order @xcite and borel resummation . by contrast , the present theoretical knowledge of the amplitude ratios for @xmath19 below @xmath5 is based only on low - order ( mainly 1- and 2-loop ) calculations which imply an uncertainty at the level of at least 1030% @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been proposed @xcite to significantly reduce this uncertainty by performing new higher - order field - theoretic calculations and borel resummations of various amplitude functions in three dimensions .",
    "both conceptual and computational steps towards this goal have already been performed .",
    "the conceptual progress includes the demonstration that the @xmath20 field theory suggested by parisi @xcite can well be realized within the minimal subtraction scheme at @xmath12 @xcite by incorporating symanzik s non - vanishing mass shift @xcite and that spurious goldstone singularities for @xmath19 below @xmath5 can well be treated within this approach @xcite by using an appropriately defined pseudo - correlation length @xcite .",
    "the computational steps include the determination of the amplitude functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the specific heat in three dimensions above @xmath5 for @xmath23 @xcite and below @xmath5 for @xmath6 @xcite , respectively , up to five - loop order , and their borel resummation . these calculations , however , were not yet complete because of an approximation regarding the additive renormalization @xmath24 of the specific heat and the associated rg function @xmath1 .",
    "due to the lack of knowledge in the literature about higher - order terms , @xmath24 and @xmath1 were approximated by their two - loop expressions .",
    "although the good agreement between low - order @xmath12 perturbation results @xcite and accurate experiments @xcite provided some indication for the smallness of the effect of the higher - order terms of @xmath1 , no reliable estimate could be given for the remaining uncertainty of @xmath25 which could well be of relevance at the level of accuracy anticipated in future experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore we recall that any inaccuracy of @xmath1 enters not only the formulas @xcite for several universal amplitude ratios but also the formulas needed to determine the effective coupling @xmath26 from the specific heat @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to provide the missing information on the higher - order terms of @xmath24 and @xmath1 by means of a new five - loop calculation .",
    "we shall show that the analytic calculation of @xmath24 and @xmath1 can be directly related to the previous calculations @xcite of the four - point vertex function .",
    "this provides the crucial simplification that no new evaluations of three- , four- and five - loop integrals are necessary but that only a new determination of symmetry and o(@xmath10 ) group factors of vacuum diagrams is sufficient .    using the five - loop expression of @xmath1 we are in the position to determine the correct higher - order terms of the minimally renormalized amplitude functions @xmath21 for @xmath4 and @xmath22 for @xmath6 on the basis of previous work @xcite where a different renormalization scheme was used .",
    "the new coefficients of the higher - order terms of @xmath21 turn out to differ considerably from the previous approximate coefficients @xcite whereas the coefficients of @xmath22 are only weakly affected by the new higher - order terms of @xmath1 .",
    "we also perform new borel resummations of @xmath1 for @xmath27 as well as of @xmath22 and of @xmath28 for @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that the result of the borel resummation for @xmath1 including the new terms up to five - loop order differs from the two - loop result @xmath29 by only less than 1% at the fixed point . for the amplitude functions , our new borel resummation results differ from the previous ones @xcite by about 1% for @xmath30 and by less than 0.1% for @xmath31 at the fixed point",
    "this is a nontrivial and important confirmation of the previous conjectures about the smallness of resummed higher - order contributions @xcite . as a first application",
    ", we calculate the universal ratios @xmath7 and @xmath32 of the leading and subleading amplitudes of the specific heat above and below @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "fully quantitative calculations for @xmath19 have to be postponed until higher - order results for @xmath22 are available .",
    "the o(@xmath10 ) symmetric @xmath3 model is defined by the usual landau - ginzburg - wilson functional @xmath33 for the @xmath10-component field @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "previously @xcite @xmath68 was employed only in its two - loop form @xcite @xmath71 here we report on a calculation of @xmath68 up to five - loop order .",
    "we would like to stress that this calculation does not require new five - loop integrations but can be performed on the basis of the previous five - loop calculation @xcite of the four - point vertex function combined with an appropriate identification of symmetry and o(@xmath10 ) group factors of vacuum diagrams which are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : vacuum ] .",
    "their negative sum determines the helmholtz free energy @xmath72 up to five - loop order . for the present purpose of determining the pole terms at @xmath65 it suffices to consider only the case @xmath73 and @xmath74 where only four - point vertices exist .",

    "the analytic expression of an @xmath83-loop diagram @xmath84 is given by the product of the coupling @xmath85 , the symmetry factor @xmath86 , the o(@xmath10 ) group factor @xmath87 and the momentum integral expression @xmath88 .",
    "thus the structure of the diagrammatic expression of a typical diagram , e.g. , @xmath89 is @xmath90 with @xmath91 and the propagators @xmath92 .",
    "the symmetry and group factors are listed in table [ table : symmetry ] .    to calculate the additive renormalization constant @xmath68 one needs to calculate those ultraviolet @xmath65 pole terms of the diagrams contributing to @xmath93 that are left after subtraction of subdivergences .",

    "<S> we present an analytic five - loop calculation for the additive renormalization constant @xmath0 and the associated renormalization - group function @xmath1 of the specific heat of the o@xmath2 symmetric @xmath3 theory within the minimal subtraction scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this calculation does not require new five - loop integrations but can be performed on the basis of the previous five - loop calculation of the four - point vertex function combined with an appropriate identification of symmetry factors of vacuum diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the amplitude functions of the specific heat in three dimensions for @xmath4 above @xmath5 and for @xmath6 below @xmath5 up to five - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> accurate results are obtained from borel resummations of @xmath1 for @xmath4 and of the amplitude functions for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> previous conjectures regarding the smallness of the resummed higher - order contributions are confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> borel resummed universal amplitude ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 are calculated for @xmath6 .    </S>",
