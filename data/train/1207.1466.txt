    "quantum vortices are the hallmark of superfuidity in either fermionic or bosonic ultracold gases@xcite . following the seminal work of abrikosov@xcite and other works on vortices in rotating helium @xcite",
    ", it has been widely verified that rotating bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , under appropriate angular velocities of rotation@xcite , indeed show a triangular vortex lattice as the most stable state .",
    "alternative ways have been devised to create vortices , such as phase imprinting@xcite and , very recently , by creation of artificial gauge fields@xcite and by varying in time the fields of a magnetic trap@xcite . in this article",
    "we introduce another way of creating vortices ; one that necessarily requires the presence of more than one atomic internal spin state coupled to an external transverse magnetic field . in this",
    "regard it is of relevance to recall that , even though very early in the development of optical traps@xcite it was pointed out@xcite the additional richness of spinor or multicomponent bose - einstein condensates , most of the efforts in creating and studying vortices were focused on rotating condensates@xcite .",
    "the novelty of our proposal , in addition to exploit the spinorial structure of the condensates , is that the vortices can be created essentially at any desired spatial location .",
    "this property , as we shall see , depends on the ability to produce a corresponding on - demand tailored magnetic field . although we have tested our ideas with 2 and 3d bec clouds , here for simplicity , we shall limit ourselves to analyze a 2d case only .",
    "the essence of vortex appearance follows from essentially the same argument provided by abrikosov@xcite . in superconductors ,",
    "vortices appear in the spatial points where the type ii superconductor allows the magnetic field to penetrate . in those vortices ( or flux tubes as they are also known ) the density is zero and",
    "the superconductor current circulates around the vortex to cancel the field in the bulk . in our proposal",
    "the situation is very similar , except that we work with multi - component wavefunctions and , unlike abrikosov , we work with non - uniform magnetic fields .",
    "we find , interestingly , that the vortices are nucleated not where the magnetic field is able to penetrate the condensate , but on the spatial points where the field is zero .",
    "additionally , the vortex solution will not have the same charge in all spin components of the wave function since , as we show , the difference in charges of two adjacent spin components must obey a selection rule dictated by the way in which the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "moreover , we find that always one spin component must have no vortex , i.e. @xmath2 , and thus , such a spin component will develop a density accumulation or spike so as to cancel the vortex formed on the other component(s ) , leaving the total density unaltered in its thomas - fermi - like form . in this way , vortices will be nucleated  on demand \" at the spatial positions where the magnetic field is zero , albeit not with the same charge on all spin components .",
    "this approach presents some additional interesting consequences .",
    "the first one is that vortices can be created with arbitrary integer charge , @xmath3 , by selecting a field with appropriate multipolar order and by including or not an axial magnetic field , that is , perpendicular to the plane of the 2d bec cloud . in this way , not only the position of the vortices , but their charge as well , can be controlled using on - demand tailored magnetic fields .",
    "it is of relevance to point out here that if the axial field is zero , the spin components that show vortices are chosen by an spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , while the presence of such a field breaks the symmetry and one can predict both the charge and the component where the vortices will be nucleated .",
    "the second interesting consequence of our approach is that it is possible to assemble vortex lattices  on demand \" by selecting magnetic fields with zeroes on the lattice sites .",
    "now , since all solutions obtained from the gross - pitaevskii and ginzburg - landau equations are of minimum free energy , we conclude that triangular vortex lattices observed both at superconductors @xcite and bec alike @xcite , are a peculiarity consequence of the use of _ uniform _ magnetic fields .",
    "rotating bec are not an exception to this .",
    "it is possible to see that a rotating bec is equivalent to a superfluid in a _ uniform _ magnetic field . in this way",
    ", our approach may have the further advantage of providing evidence of a unique cause underlying the different vortex nucleation techniques currently at use .",
    "in this article we first analyze the corresponding gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation to describe how the vortices appear .",
    "the discussion is valid in principle for any spin value of the atoms composing the bec state , namely , @xmath4 .",
    "we discuss a very general solution for any transverse magnetic field that vanishes linearly , quadratically , etc . at chosen locations .",
    "we shall see that the tf solution guides the formation of vortices , including its size and location if the axial field is nonzero . in section iii , we present a variety of different cases by numerically solving the corresponding gp equations , in order to illustrate our results .    in the last section",
    "we suggest how this situation may be experimentally realized in a gas of @xmath0rb occupying all three @xmath1 states in an optical trap . in this regard",
    ", we point out that precursors of the present study are the analysis of refs . @xcite and @xcite , the former discussing the appearance of vortices in the center of a ioffe - pritchard trap in a @xmath5 condensate , while the latter being a detailed study of vortices on two - level condensates , yet , in rotating systems .",
    "consider a 2 or 3 dimensional bec superfluid at zero temperature .",
    "the gas is confined by an optical trap . in addition , there exists an external _ transverse _ magnetic field that couples to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spin components .",
    "the atoms have spin @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 gp equations in a very general form are , @xmath10 \\psi_m(\\vec r ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & - m_0\\sum_{m^\\prime } \\left[j_x^ { m m^\\prime } b_x(\\vec r)+j_y^{m m^\\prime}b_y(\\vec r ) +   j_z^{m m^\\prime } b_z\\right ] \\psi_{m^\\prime}(\\vec r ) \\nonumber\\\\   & & = \\mu \\psi_{m}(\\vec r ) ,   \\label{gp - gral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the @xmath12-dimensional position vector .",
    "the indices , @xmath13 , denote the @xmath14 different spin components .",
    "the confining external potentials are @xmath15 and we have considered the possibility that each spin component feels a different confining trapping potential ; however , for illustration purposes we shall assume below that they are all the same harmonic potential . in general , we assume the external trapping potentials to be smooth at any point .",
    "we can also , in principle , assume that the scattering length is different for any pair of components ; but again , in the numerical evaluations below , we will consider the simple case @xmath16 .",
    "this is certainly an important point since it is known@xcite that the scattering length truly depends on the internal atomic states and this in turn leads to different types of macroscopic  magnetic \" properties of the condensates . by assuming a unique positive scattering length throughout",
    ", one may assert that the condensates with which we are dealing are at the border of being ferromagnetic or polar@xcite .",
    "this does not invalidate the point we are highlighting here .",
    "the most important part , and the novelty of our argument , is the coupling of the spin components via an external _ inhomogeneous _ transverse magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath6 and @xmath7 angular momentum matrices of spin @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we also include a _ uniform _ axial magnetic field @xmath20 . in ( [ gp - gral ] ) , @xmath21 is the chemical potential and @xmath22 the magnetic moment of an atom .",
    "now , the external magnetic field must obey @xmath23 at any point .",
    "in addition , since we want to resemble a true experimental situation , we should demand that throughout the condensate @xmath24 is also obeyed . in what follows",
    "we will consider these two restrictions to build the proposed fields , however , we will also include more general situations .",
    "we also defer to the following sections the question of how the proposed fields may be produced .    the main point of the discussion",
    "is based on proposing that the transverse magnetic field becomes zero at isolated points @xmath25 , namely , @xmath26 .",
    "placing the origin at @xmath25 , the magnetic field very near that point obeying @xmath23 and @xmath24 , have the following form , @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we shall call @xmath32 dipolar , @xmath33 quadrupolar , etc . following the usual electrodynamics",
    "@xmath34 are constants with appropriate units . the @xmath35 component of the field @xmath20 is assumed constant .",
    "for the sake of exemplifying the two simplest cases , we write down the explicit forms for @xmath36 and @xmath33 , @xmath37 and @xmath38    let us turn now to the main problem : vortex nucleation using the fields already discussed . without loss of generality , we assume the same confining potential @xmath39 for all components and the same strength @xmath40 for all interacting pairs . we consider the external magnetic fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 actually given by ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) , but centered at the origin @xmath43 . below",
    "we shall discuss the conditions for the location of of the zeroes of the fields to be set anywhere within the condensate . using the standard properties of angular momentum@xcite , equations ( [ gp - gral ] )",

    "let us consider the thomas - fermi ( tf ) solution obtained by neglecting the kinetic energy term in ( [ gp - f ] ) .",
    "one first finds that the _ total _ particle density @xmath53 obeys the following @xmath54 different solutions , @xmath55 for @xmath45 .",
    "given all variables equal , it appears that @xmath56 , its largest value , yields the lowest value of the chemical potential @xmath21 .",
    "since this is the eigenenergy of the gp equation , we take the tf solution as given by , @xmath57 as we show below , we always find that the total density agrees essentially with this solution , except at the edges of the cloud .",
    "notice that it does not show any trace of the presence of a vortex .",
    "substitution of the solution ( [ tf ] ) into ( [ gp - f ] ) yields a set of @xmath54 coupled linear equations for @xmath51 .",
    "these equations can be explicitly solved for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , etc .",
    "one finds two very different behaviors depending on the values of @xmath20 .",
    "first , we analyze @xmath61 .",
    "one can check case by case the solutions . for @xmath58 , @xmath62 for @xmath59 , @xmath63 for @xmath60 , @xmath64 and so on .",
    "that is , the particle density of any component is a fraction of the total density , and the density distribution is symmetric .",
    "since all density components are proportional to the tf solution , none of them shows a vortex .",
    "however , the laplacian term induces a vortex solution at the origin .",
    "that is , near the origin where the magnetic field vanishes , the density components behave as , @xmath65 where @xmath66 are amplitude and normalization constants and @xmath48 must be an integer , including zero , by demanding single valuedness of the wave functions @xmath67 .",
    "these satisfy , @xmath68 _ independently _ of the value of @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath69 , the solution ( [ vortex ] ) is a vortex of topological charge , or order , @xmath70 and of size @xmath71 , namely , the size of usual gross - pitaevskii vortices@xcite .",
    "we recall that the superfluid velocity is given by @xmath72 such that the circulation around the vortex is given by , @xmath73 in summary , near the zero of the magnetic field , @xmath74 , the kinetic energy term does not contribute because of the appearance of a vortex , while for @xmath75 the tf solution takes over .",
    "an interesting problem now arises . because of the symmetry of the hamiltonian",
    ", one can not assert in which component or components , the vortices may appear .",
    "an spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism must enter to decide it .",
    "there are two restrictions , one is the rule of the phases given by ( [ confas ] ) and the other the fact that the _ total _ density follows tf everywhere .",
    "the latter imply that at least one component can not show a vortex .",
    "the former thus gives us the possible solutions .",
    "for @xmath58 , @xmath76 as mentioned , both solutions are possible , the system takes one by an spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "this result has been numerically verified . for @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath60 , @xmath79",
    "the presence of an axial constant field @xmath80 breaks the symmetry and yields only one of the above solutions .",
    "however , it does affect the sizes of the vortices as well . that is , if @xmath80 , the tf solutions already show a vortex solutions .",
    "let us return to the set of equations ( [ gp - f ] ) with @xmath81 given by ( [ tf ] ) .",
    "take @xmath82 for definiteness , then it is easy to verify that in the vicinity of the zero of the transverse magnetic field , the tf density components behave as , for @xmath58 @xmath83 and , in turn , this implies @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "that is , while there is a vortex of charge @xmath86 at the @xmath87 component , there is a  density spike \" at the @xmath88 component . if @xmath89 , then the spike is at the @xmath87 component , while a vortex of charge @xmath90 appears at the @xmath88 one .",
    "the size of the vortex is now @xmath91 .",
    "all this is numerically verified below .    for completeness",

    "again , the size of the vortices is @xmath91 .",
    "if the axial field is negative @xmath89 , the solution is a spike in the @xmath97 component , a vortex @xmath100 and a vortex @xmath101 at the @xmath99 and @xmath100 components .    now , let us note that since the above argument only gives the solution at the given point @xmath25 where the external magnetic field vanishes , one can consider cases where a magnetic field has zeroes at different spatial locations . applying the same argument near any of those points , a vortex will be nucleated at any desired position . in the following section we exemplify all these features",
    "in this section we illustrate the present mechanism for vortex formation with a variety of cases . for simplicity ,",

    "the signs of the charges are reversed if the lattice is formed in the @xmath113 spin component .",

    "the circulation field is shown in black arrows .",
    "one can observe the alternating character of the vortex topological charge .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "as we have seen , in multicomponent bec clouds , the presence of transverse magnetic fields with vanishing values at given spatial locations , nucleate vortices at those very points .",
    "the vortices can thus be placed at any location  on demand \" . for single vortices",
    ", one can simply choose the zero of the fields , such as those in eqs .",
    "( [ b11 ] ) and ( [ b12 ] ) , at any location and a vortex will be nucleated there . for multiple vortices , one can set multiple wires , such as in eq .",
    "( [ wire ] ) , and by changing the current intensities almost at random , one finds different zeroes that , again , nucleate vortices .",
    "the same comment applies to any lattice with zeroes of the field . in addition , we have verified the further prediction that the total density @xmath221 does not show any evidence of the vortices and that its form is the  simple \" tf solution of gp in a harmonic potential .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the present form of the appearance of the vortices with that of a rotating superfluid . in the rotating frame ,",
    "the ( one - component ) gp equation looks like@xcite , @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the angular velocity of rotation and @xmath224 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath225 by a vector identity one can rewrite , @xmath226 and , therefore , one can see that the rotation term is equivalent to introducing a vector potential @xmath227 corresponding to an axial uniform ",
    "magnetic field \" @xmath228 ( in appropriate units ) .    in its celebrated paper , abrikosov@xcite showed that if the above equations hold , a lattice of vortices , of the type described in section i , will be created by the presence of such a magnetic or appropriate gauge field .",
    "it does appear , therefore , that vortices are created by the coupling of the _ orbital _ angular momentum @xmath224 with the external field @xmath229 , i.e. @xmath230 . since many vortices are created , and the global state of the gas must be the most stable one , the developed vortices then arrange themselves in a triangular lattice due to the repulsive interaction among them@xcite .    in the case described in this work , vortices also appear because of a magnetic angular momentum coupled to an external gauge field .",
    "it does appear , however , that in the present case it is the _ intrinsic _ or _ spin _ angular momentum the main player instead of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we believe that the above two cases may not be as different as they may appear .",
    "this assertion may be based on the observation that gp equation near a zero of the magnetic field can be transformed as one with an artificial gauge field coupled to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "let us see this briefly .",
    "for simplicity , take the case @xmath231 , @xmath61 , with @xmath232 .",

    "the induced artificial gauge potentials may be easily calculated@xcite .",
    "in particular , the diagonal potential @xmath239 is , @xmath240 which corresponds to a nonuniform _ singular _ magnetic field , actually , to that of a magnetic monopole .",
    "thus , the vortex nucleation in the rotating condensate appears to be equivalent to ours via an artificial magnetic monopole field .",
    "this , in turn , is intimately related to berry phases@xcite .",
    "therefore , the present scheme may also be seen from the perspective of artificial gauge fields@xcite , although it should be clear that we do not assume adiabaticity of the diagonal terms in ( [ lg ] ) .",
    "because of the scope of the article , we did not present results we have found in 3d bec s . if the magnetic fields are chosen just as in the 2d case , on finds that the vortices are of cylindrical nature in the @xmath241direction .",
    "this is because the nucleation points ( where the transverse magnetic field becomes zero ) are actually filaments that cross the full bec cloud .",
    "we believe the present results can be simply realized in actual experimental conditions .",
    "in particular , for a @xmath0rb bec there are two cases that can be simply matched .",
    "one is the @xmath1 case that naturally corresponds to the @xmath242 situation here discussed .",
    "the other , the case @xmath243 may be tailored to have only the components @xmath244 and @xmath245 corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "the external magnetic fields may be produced by single - wire magnetic fields , as given by ( [ wire ] ) .",
    "however , an additional non - uniform small magnetic field in the @xmath35 direction should be used to separate the spin components such that the phenomena may be observed .",
    "the present scheme suggests also an alternative route to quantum turbulence .",
    "recently , bagnato et al.@xcite found a way to stir a @xmath0rb condensate by means of time dependent magnetic fields , achieving a state of quantum turbulence .",
    "although we are not asserting that our procedure explains those experimental results , it does appear that once vortices are nucleated by transverse magnetic fields , the vortices may be stirred by simply changing in time the positions of the zeroes of the magnetic field .",
    "it seems evident that a strong stirring of the vortices may lead to a quantum turbulent state .",
    "the study is under way and will be reported elsewhere ."
