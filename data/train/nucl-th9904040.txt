    "the investigation of @xmath0-meson production in both hadronic @xcite and electromagnetic @xcite processes at low and intermediate energies has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "a major motivation for those studies is the hope that one can obtain information about the amount of hidden strangeness in the nucleon .",
    "indications for a possibly significant @xmath4 component in the nucleon have been found , among others , in the analysis of the so - called @xmath5 @xmath6 term @xcite and from the emc measurement of deep inelastic polarized @xmath7 scattering ( `` nucleon - spin crisis '' ) @xcite .    in the context of @xmath0-meson production",
    "processes one expects @xcite that a large amount of hidden strangeness in the nucleon would manifest itself in reaction cross sections that significantly exceed the values estimated from the ozi rule @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological rule states that reactions involving disconnected quark lines are forbidden . in the naive quark model",
    "the nucleon has no @xmath4 content , whereas the @xmath0-meson is an ideally mixed pure @xmath4 state .",
    "thus , in this case , the ozi rule implies vanishing nucleon - nucleon-@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) coupling and , accordingly , a negligibly small production of @xmath0-mesons from nucleons ( or anti - nucleons ) by electromagnetic or ( non - strange ) hadronic probes . in practice",
    "there is a slight deviation from ideal mixing of the vector mesons , which means that the @xmath0-meson has a small @xmath8 component .",
    "thus , even if the ozi rule is strictly enforced , there is a non - zero coupling of the @xmath0 to the nucleon , although the coupling is very small .",
    "its value can be used to calculate lower limits for corresponding cross sections .",
    "for example , under similar kinematic conditions to cancel out phase space effects , one expects cross section ratios of reactions involving the production of a @xmath0- and an @xmath2-meson , respectively , to be @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are systems that do not contain strange quarks . here , @xmath13 is the deviation from the ideal @xmath14 mixing angle . with the value @xmath15 @xcite one gets the rather small ratio of @xmath16 .",
    "recent experiments on antiproton - proton ( @xmath17 ) annihilation at rest at the lear facility at cern revealed , however , considerably larger branching ratios for various @xmath0 production channels @xcite .",
    "many of the measured ratios @xmath18 are about @xmath19 or even larger ( cf . the compilation of data given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which means that they exceed the estimate from the ozi rule by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "significant deviations from the ozi rule were also found in the reactions @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21he@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these observed large @xmath0-production cross sections were interpreted by some authors as a clear signal for an intrinsic @xmath4 component in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "however , this explanation is still controversial .",
    "there is an alternative approach aimed at understanding these large cross sections solely by the strong rescattering effects in the final state @xcite . in this case @xmath0",
    "production occurs via two - step processes with intermediate states such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , etc .",
    ", where each step is allowed by the ozi rule .",
    "corresponding quantitative calculations have , indeed , demonstrated that the resulting production cross sections are sufficiently large to agree with the experiments without a violation of the ozi rule @xcite .    in this connection ,",
    "the production of @xmath0-mesons in proton - proton ( @xmath25 ) collisions is of special interest . in principle",
    ", the production cross section can be used for a direct determination of the @xmath1 coupling strength .",
    "any appreciable @xmath1 coupling in excess of the value given by the ozi rule could be seen as evidence for hidden strangeness in the nucleon .",
    "of course , there is also an alternative picture : one in which the coupling of the @xmath0-meson to the nucleon does not occur via possible @xmath4 components in the nucleon , but via intermediate states with strangeness @xcite .",
    "specifically , this means that the @xmath0-meson couples to the nucleon via virtual @xmath26 , @xmath27 , etc . states .",
    "corresponding model calculations have shown , however , that such processes give rise to ( effective ) @xmath1 coupling constants comparable to the ozi values and therefore should not play a role in drawing conclusions concerning hidden strangeness in the nucleon . accordingly",
    ", one expects that cross section ratios @xmath28 should provide a clear sign for a possible ozi violation .",
    "indeed , data presented recently by the disto collaboration @xcite indicate that this ratio , after correcting for the phase space effects , is about eight times larger than the ozi estimate ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "the present work focuses on the @xmath29 process .",
    "we discuss the experimental prerequisites that would enable one to disentangle competing reaction mechanisms for @xmath0-production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath30 ) collisions and to extract the value of the @xmath1 coupling strength . in this context",
    "we shall show that the angular distribution of the produced @xmath0-mesons plays a crucial role .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that the almost isotropic angular distribution seen in the data from the disto collaboration @xcite indicates that the @xmath1 coupling is very small . in the absence of a set of data sufficient to permit an accurate determination of the @xmath1 coupling strength",
    ", we impose certain reasonable assumptions and carry out a combined analysis of the recent @xmath0-meson production data of the disto collaboration @xcite and the data of @xmath2-meson production from saturne @xcite .",
    "this analysis yields a range of values for @xmath3 that is compatible with the ozi rule .",
    "we describe the @xmath29 reaction within a relativistic meson - exchange model .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of the formalism . )",
    "the transition amplitude is calculated in distorted wave born approximation , where the @xmath30 final state interaction is taken into account explicitly .",
    "the final state interaction is known to be very important at near - threshold energies . for the @xmath30 interaction",
    "we employ the model bonn b as defined in table a.1 of ref .",
    "this model reproduces the @xmath30 phase shifts up to the pion - production threshold as well as the deuteron properties @xcite .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , we do not consider the initial state interaction explicitly . at the corresponding high incident energies the @xmath30 interaction is a slowly varying function of energy .",
    "its main effect is to lead to an overall reduction of the @xmath31 cross section @xcite , as has been shown explicitly for the case of the reaction @xmath32 by batini et al .",
    "@xcite . in the present model",
    "this effect of the initial state interaction is accounted for by an appropriate adjustment of the ( phenomenological ) form factors at the hadronic vertices .    in the next section",
    "we discuss possible basic production currents that can contribute to the reaction @xmath31 . using su(3 ) flavor symmetry and imposing the ozi rule",
    ", we calculate meson - meson - meson and nucleon - nucleon - meson coupling constants that are relevant for the @xmath0-production currents and then estimate the corresponding contributions to the total cross section .",
    "these reveal that the @xmath33 meson - exchange current is the dominant one .",
    "in the same section we also give a short outline of our formalism and introduce the free parameters of our model . in sect .",
    "iii we describe in detail the procedure for the combined analysis of @xmath0- and @xmath2-production data .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in the last section .",
    "in the case of the reaction @xmath34 , the dominant production mechanisms namely , the nucleonic and @xmath35 mesonic currents , as depicted in fig .  [ fig1]can be identified without involved considerations .",
    "this is because of the relatively large @xmath36 and @xmath35 coupling strengths .",
    "the @xmath35 meson - exchange current depends also on the @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings , which are likewise large .",
    "therefore this production mechanism is by far the dominant one among the possible exchange currents @xcite . for @xmath0-meson production ,",
    "however , the situation is much less clear _ a priori _ and requires careful consideration . in order to determine the importance of various possible meson - exchange currents , we first estimate systematically the coupling strengths of the hadronic vertices that enter into these @xmath0-production exchange currents",
    "this is done using effective lagrangians , assuming su(3 ) flavor symmetry , and imposing the ozi rule .",
    "we note that in this scheme the su(3 ) symmetry breaking is introduced through the use of the physical masses of the hadrons in calculating the observables .    in the present work we are interested in three - meson vertices involving at least one @xmath0-meson .",
    "we , then , have @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 vertices ( @xmath42 vector meson , @xmath43 pseudo - scalar meson ) .",
    "the su(3 ) effective lagrangian has the form @xmath44m_8 ) +                                   \\beta tr(\\{m_8,m_8\\}m_8 ) \\right ] \\\\",

    "the ozi condition relates the basic coupling constants of the su(3 ) octet and singlet members in the lagrangian , @xmath52 , so that there is only one free coupling constant .",
    "this one is then fixed by a fit to some appropriate observables such as decay rates .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 vertices involve only @xmath50-type coupling if we require charge conjugation invariance .",
    "this leads to the vanishing of all @xmath40 and @xmath41 couplings involving either the @xmath2- or @xmath0-meson relevant to the present work .",
    "the @xmath48-type coupling leads to g - parity violating vertices and will be ignored .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath39 vertices involve only @xmath48-type coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite essentially the same scheme as proposed here has been used to describe radiative meson decays .",
    "therefore , we use the model parameters determined in that paper .",
    "the effective lagrangian used in ref .",
    "@xcite can easily be cast into the form given by eq.([su3lm ] ) .",
    "the resulting coupling constants @xmath53 at those vertices relevant for the meson - exchange currents of interest are tabulated in table  [ tab1 ] .    in order to estimate the magnitude of the various meson - exchange currents one needs not only the @xmath39 couplings , but the corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath55 couplings as well .",
    "thus , in addition to the @xmath38 and @xmath37 couplings , the empirically poorly known @xmath36 , @xmath1 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 couplings are needed .",
    "we estimate these coupling strengths using the same scheme used for determining the @xmath39 couplings , i.e. , the su(3 ) effective lagrangian @xmath58m_8 )                                   + \\beta tr(\\{\\bar b , b\\}m_8 ) \\right ] \\\\                 & + & g_s \\beta   tr(\\{\\bar b , b\\}m_s ) \\ , \\label{su3lb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plus the ozi rule .",
    "this latter condition yields @xmath59 . in the above lagrangian",
    "@xmath11 stands for the su(3 ) baryon - octet matrix .",
    "the @xmath48-type coupling in the su(3 ) lagrangian is not allowed for the @xmath54 couplings if one requires spin - independence for @xmath60 and @xmath61 couplings within the identically flavored baryons , @xmath62 . using the value of the @xmath14 mixing angle from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath63 from ref .",
    "@xcite , we find @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the @xmath36 and @xmath1 vector - coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the @xmath66 tensor - coupling constants are simply chosen to be @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( as distinct from @xmath69 , which stands for vector mesons in general ) .",
    "this choice of @xmath70 is consistent with values from an su(3 ) estimate @xcite as well from other sources @xcite . for the @xmath56 coupling constant",
    "we take the value used in @xmath30 scattering analysis @xcite , @xmath71 .",
    "this value , together with the @xmath72 mixing angle of @xmath73 , as suggested by the quadratic mass formula , and the @xmath38 coupling constant , @xmath74 , leads to the ratio @xmath75  which is close to the value of @xmath76 extracted from a systematic analysis of semileptonic hyperon decays @xcite .",
    "the @xmath77 coupling constant is related to the @xmath56 coupling constant by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the deviation from the pseudoscalar ideal mixing angle .",
    "we find @xmath80 .",
    "once all the relevant coupling constants have been determined , we can estimate the relative importance of various @xmath39-exchange currents to the @xmath0-meson production . in corresponding test calculations it turned out that the @xmath33-exchange current is by far the dominant mesonic current .",
    "the _ combined _ contribution of all other exchange currents to the total cross section is about two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "we have also examined contributions from meson - exchange currents involving other heavy mesons , in particular , the @xmath81- and @xmath82-exchange currents , whose coupling constants ( upper limits ) can be estimated from the observed decay of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we find a negligible contribution to the @xmath0-meson production .",
    "furthermore the @xmath84- and @xmath85-exchange currents also turned out to be negligible .",
    "finally we note that , as in the case of @xmath2 production , there are no experimental indications of any of the known isospin-1/2 @xmath86 resonances decaying into @xmath87 .    with the above considerations ,",
    "the @xmath88-meson ( @xmath89 ) production current @xmath90 is given by the sum of the nucleonic and @xmath91 meson - exchange currents , @xmath92 , as illustrated diagrammatically in fig .",
    "explicitly , the nucleonic current is defined as @xmath93 with @xmath94 denoting the @xmath66 vertex and @xmath95 the nucleon ( feynman ) propagator for nucleon @xmath96 .",

    "[ fig1]a .",

    "@xmath101 denotes the vector coupling constant and @xmath102 , with @xmath70 the tensor coupling constant .",
    "@xmath103 denotes the nucleon mass .    as in most meson - exchange models of interactions ,",
    "each hadronic vertex is furnished with a form factor in order to account for , among other things , the composite nature of the hadrons involved . in this spirit",
    "the @xmath66 vertex obtained from the above lagrangian is multiplied by a form factor .",
    "the theoretical understanding of this form factor is beyond the scope of the present paper ; we assume it to be of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the four - momentum squared of either the incoming or outgoing off - shell nucleon .",
    "it is normalized to unity when the nucleon is on its mass shell , i.e. , when @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath91 vertex required for constructing the meson - exchange current , @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , is derived from the lagrangian density @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the levi - civita antisymmetric tensor with @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath91 vertex obtained from the above lagrangian is multiplied by a form factor which is taken to be of the form @xmath111 it is normalized to unity at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the parameter @xmath114 (= 0 or 1 ) is introduced in order to allow for different normalization points as explained later .",
    "the form factor given above differs from the one used in @xcite in that it uses a common cutoff parameter @xmath115 for both @xmath116 and @xmath117-meson instead of separate cutoff masses .",
    "the meson - exchange current is then given by @xmath118_1 id_{\\alpha\\beta}(q_\\rho )                \\gamma^{\\beta\\mu}_{v\\rho\\pi}(q_\\rho , q_\\pi , k_v )                i\\delta(q_\\pi ) [ \\gamma_{nn\\pi}(q_\\pi)]_2    +    ( 1\\leftrightarrow 2 ) \\ , \\label{mec_cur}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 stand for the @xmath117- and @xmath116-meson ( feynman ) propagators , respectively .",
    "the vertices @xmath121 involved are self - explanatory .",
    "both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 vertices , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are taken consistently with the @xmath30 potential used to generate the @xmath30 final state interaction .",
    "our model for vector - meson production described above contains five parameters : two for the mesonic current ( the coupling constant @xmath124 and the cutoff parameter @xmath115 ) and three for the nucleonic current ( the coupling constants @xmath101 and @xmath70 , and the cutoff parameter @xmath125 ) . in ref .  @xcite we pointed out that the angular distribution of the emitted @xmath2-mesons is a sensitive quantity for determining the _ absolute amount _ of nucleonic as well as mesonic current contributions , in addition to the relative sign between the two contributions .",
    "this applies also to the case of @xmath0-meson production since , as we have argued above , the dominant production mechanisms are exactly the same for both processes .",
    "specifically , this means that the knowledge of the angular distribution allows one to fix the cutoff parameter in the mesonic current since the coupling constant @xmath124 can be extracted from the relevant measured partial decay widths @xcite .",
    "the nucleonic current , however , involves three free parameters . in this case knowledge of the angular distribution allows one to determine only the product of the @xmath66 coupling constants and the form factor .",
    "consequently one can not extract a unique value for @xmath101 directly from the analysis ; further constraints  such as the energy dependence of the angular distribution  are needed . as discussed in @xcite , the energy dependence will impose some constraint on the form factor . also , in the energy region far from the threshold , the tensor - to - vector coupling ratio @xmath126 influences the energy dependence of the total cross section .",
    "another constraint may be imposed by spin polarization observables . in the case of @xmath25",
    "bremsstrahlung producing hard photons , it is known that the reaction is dominated by the magnetization current , to which the tensor coupling of the @xmath127 vertex contributes .",
    "therefore we would expect that the spin observables in @xmath128 reactions become more sensitive to the tensor coupling @xmath70 for energetic vector mesons .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the determination of the @xmath1 coupling strength is of special interest in the study of vector - meson production since its magnitude is usually associated with the amount of hidden strangeness in the nucleon . in this section",
    "we utilize our model to obtain some information on this coupling strength . however , as pointed out in the previous section , the angular distribution alone is not sufficient for determining @xmath3 uniquely .",
    "we therefore choose to perform a combined analysis of @xmath0- and @xmath2-meson production ; i.e. , to use the available data from both reactions to extract @xmath3 . a combined analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath2 production also allows us to address the important issue concerning the violation of the ozi rule .    before doing so some considerations about the existing experimental data",
    "are in order .",
    "so far only very few precision data of vector - meson production in @xmath30 collisions are available .",
    "first there are total cross sections for the reaction @xmath34 in the energy range @xmath129 to 1.98 gev from saclay @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are angular distributions of the emitted meson for both @xmath2- and @xmath0-meson production ( although with no absolute normalization ) and the ratio of the total cross sections @xmath130 at @xmath131 gev from the disto collaboration @xcite .",
    "all the other presently available data @xcite are from the 1970 s and not very accurate .",
    "furthermore these data lie in an energy range far above the vector - meson production thresholds . at the corresponding excess energies the @xmath30 interaction in the final state",
    "is already dominated by inelastic processes .",
    "such processes are not accounted for in the @xmath30 model that we employ , which is valid only for energies below the pion - production threshold ( i.e. , excess energies below @xmath132 mev ) , and therefore we do not consider those high - energy data in our analysis . since the excess energy in the @xmath2-meson production channel of the disto measurement ( @xmath133 mev ) is already beyond the energy range where we trust our model , we do not use the measured production ratio directly .",
    "instead we interpolate the total cross section for @xmath2-meson production from the existing data @xcite and use this value , and the measured ratio , to fix the absolute normalization of the measured @xmath0-meson angular distribution @xcite .",
    "our estimate yields @xmath134b at @xmath135 gev .",
    "this value of @xmath136 , combined with the measured ratio of @xmath137 @xcite , leads to @xmath138b .",
    "inevitably , such an interpolation is subject to uncertainties .",
    "we have , therefore , carried out the same analysis as reported below , but starting from a @xmath0-production cross section that is smaller / larger by about 40% .",
    "we arrived at basically the same conclusions and therefore refrain from showing the corresponding results here .",
    "since we have only one @xmath0-meson angular distribution and five @xmath2-meson total cross section data available in the range of applicability of our model , we are forced to impose some constraints on the model in order to reduce the number of free parameters . to this end",
    "we make the following assumptions :    * the same cutoff parameter @xmath139 ( cf .",
    "eq.([formfactorm ] ) ) is used for the meson - exchange currents for @xmath2- and @xmath0-meson production .",
    "this is a reasonable choice since the off - shell particles at the @xmath91 vertex are the same in both production processes .",
    "likewise , the cutoff parameter @xmath125 ( cf .",
    "eq.([formfactorn ] ) ) in the nucleonic current is assumed to be the same for @xmath2- and @xmath0-meson production , i.e. , @xmath140 . *",
    "the @xmath36 vector coupling constant is given by the value obtained from su(3 ) flavor symmetry and imposing the ozi rule , i.e. , @xmath141 , where @xmath13 is the deviation from the ideal @xmath14 mixing angle .",
    "with @xmath142 @xcite and the @xmath37 coupling constant of @xmath143 @xcite , this yields a value of @xmath144 , which is close to the value of @xmath145 obtained in a recent @xmath30 scattering analysis @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty here comes from the uncertainties involved in @xmath146 and @xmath147 . *",
    "the tensor - to - vector coupling ratio , @xmath148 , is the same for the @xmath2- and @xmath0-mesons : @xmath149 .",
    "this relation is also suggested by su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "furthermore we choose the parameter @xmath150 to be fixed beforehand .",
    "we consider the values @xmath151 , which covers a rather ample range . unlike the case of the @xmath117-meson",
    ", we do not expect @xmath152 to be large , especially for the @xmath2-meson .",
    "this is supported by an estimate @xcite , in which su(3 ) is applied to the sum @xmath153 rather than to @xmath70 alone , which is motivated by the success of su(6 ) in predicting the magnetic moments of the baryons .",
    "other investigations @xcite also support small values of @xmath154 .",
    "these assumptions reduce the number of parameters of the model to be fixed to a total of five : the cutoff parameters @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and the coupling constants @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath3 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the first two coupling constants can be extracted from the measured branching ratios . specifically , the coupling constant of @xmath159 is determined directly from the measured decay width of @xmath160 @xcite . the coupling constant @xmath158",
    ", however , can not be determined directly ( as in the case of @xmath157 ) since @xmath161 is energetically forbidden .",
    "we therefore extract it indirectly from the radiative decay width of @xmath162 , assuming vector meson dominance ; we obtain @xmath163 .",
    "the signs of these couplings are inferred from su(3 ) symmetry considerations .",
    "we note that these coupling constants are extracted at different kinematics : @xmath157 is determined at @xmath164 and @xmath165 , whereas @xmath158 is extracted at @xmath166 and @xmath165 . the corresponding form factor ( cf .",
    "eq.([formfactorm ] ) ) should , therefore , be normalized accordingly , i.e. , @xmath167 and @xmath168 for the @xmath33 and @xmath35 vertex form factor , respectively .",
    "with the coupling constants at the three - meson - point vertices fixed , we are then left with three free parameters which may be adjusted to reproduce the @xmath0- and @xmath2-meson production data .",
    "we are now prepared to apply the model to the reactions @xmath34 and @xmath31 . before doing any calculation , however",
    ", we note that the nucleonic current contribution to the @xmath0-meson production should be rather small , as the measured angular distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is more or less isotropic .",
    "recall that the angular distribution alone is sufficient to establish the magnitude of both the nucleonic and mesonic currents uniquely , and that the mesonic current yields a flat angular distribution , whereas the nucleonic current gives an approximately @xmath169 dependence  @xcite . for the determination of the free parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath3 we proceed in the following way :",
    "we assume that the angular distribution of the @xmath0-meson resembles the solid curve in fig .",
    "we then determine the required contributions from both the nucleonic and mesonic currents .",
    "the mesonic current involves only one free parameter : namely the cutoff mass @xmath170 of the @xmath33 vertex form factor ( cf .",
    "eq.([formfactorm ] ) ) . that is fixed by the requirement of reproducing the angular distribution .",
    "we obtain @xmath171 mev .",
    "turning now to @xmath2 production , we require that our model describe the total cross section data from saturne @xcite .",
    "since we assumed the @xmath36 vector coupling to be @xmath172 ( and @xmath173 is fixed to the two values mentioned above ) , one can determine the cutoff parameter @xmath174 in eq.([formfactorn])the only remaining free parameter  from the @xmath2-production cross section .",
    "owing to the destructive interference between the nucleonic and mesonic currents , we find , in general , two possible values of @xmath156 for given @xmath175 and @xmath150 .",
    "the resulting values are listed in table  [ tab2 ] and the corresponding cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , in contrast to the angular distribution , the total cross section is unable to constrain uniquely the absolute contribution of the nucleonic and mesonic currents . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the energy dependence of the total cross section may be useful to further constrain the ratio @xmath150 and/or the form factor at the production vertex .",
    "unfortunately , no data is available at energies that are well above the threshold , yet still low enough for the present model to be applicable .",
    "it should be mentioned that effects of the finite width of the @xmath2-meson  which influence considerably the energy dependence of the total cross section close to the threshold energy @xcite  haven been taken into account in the results shown in fig .",
    "this is done by folding the calculated cross section with the breit - wigner mass distribution of the @xmath2-meson .",
    "once the cutoff parameter @xmath156 is fixed , one can return to the angular distribution of the @xmath0-meson production in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and adjust the @xmath1 coupling constant @xmath3 to reproduce the amount of the nucleonic current contribution previously determined . since we have two values of @xmath156 for each chosen value of @xmath150 , we get four values of @xmath3 corresponding to the four possible combinations .",
    "the values for the @xmath1 coupling constant thus extracted are compiled at the bottom of table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "they range from @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "as already acknowledged above , the lack of a more complete and accurate set of data prevents us from achieving a more accurate determination of @xmath3 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 thus obtained may be compared with those resulting from su(3 ) flavor symmetry considerations and imposition of the ozi rule , @xmath178 where the factor @xmath179 is due to the deviation from the ideal @xmath14 mixing .",
    "the numerical value is obtained using the values @xmath180 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the error bar quoted is due to the uncertainty involved in @xmath146 and @xmath147 . comparing the value ( eq.([ozi ] ) ) with those obtained in the present work",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0-production data can be described with @xmath1 coupling constants that are compatible with the ozi value .",
    "it should be mentioned that although our analysis of the existing disto and saturne data yields @xmath1 coupling constants which are compatible with the ozi value , it is necessary to introduce a violation of the ozi rule at the @xmath91 vertices ( @xmath181 ) in the meson - exchange current .",
    "this can easily be verified by calculating , e.g. , the @xmath33 coupling constants at @xmath182 using the form factor given by eq.([formfactorm ] ) with the cutoff parameter @xmath155 extracted from the @xmath0-meson angular distribution data .",
    "we obtain @xmath183 .",
    "this value is almost a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding ozi value of @xmath184 given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we found it impossible to describe the data without introducing this ozi violation ( independently of the considerations about the @xmath1 coupling constant ) for the following reasons : a sufficiently large contribution from the mesonic current in the @xmath0-meson production , as demanded by the measured angular distribution , can only be obtained with the @xmath33 coupling constant extracted from the measured decay width of @xmath185 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "for the coupling constant extracted from radiative meson decay , an unrealistically large cut - off mass @xmath155 in excess of @xmath187 would be required .",
    "on the other hand , with @xmath186 and the corresponding ozi value of @xmath188 for the @xmath35 coupling constant , we have little chance of describing the energy dependence of the @xmath2-meson total cross section ; it simply rises much too strongly with the energy . in this context",
    "let us mention that a knowledge of the angular distribution of the @xmath2-meson in the energy region where the model is applicable is of particular importance .",
    "corresponding data would enable us to pin down the contributions for the mesonic current and thereby impose much more stringent constraints on the parameters of the model relevant to a possible violation of the ozi rule at the @xmath91 vertices .",
    "it would be very useful to clarify this point , specifically because an analysis of the radiative decay widths of the vector mesons within the vector - meson dominance model , involving the very same coupling constants , led to @xmath91 coupling constants which satisfy the ozi rule to within @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "furthermore it is certainly desirable to test the present model in describing other independent reactions processes ( e.g. , @xmath0- and @xmath2-meson photoproduction ) .",
    "we plan such investigations in the near future .",
    "finally , we wish to make a remark on the `` naive '' ozi estimation as expressed by eq.([ratio ] ) .",
    "this equation is simply a consequence of assuming that the @xmath0- and @xmath2-meson production amplitudes differ from each other only by their coupling strengths , which are assumed to be related by su(3 ) flavor symmetry plus the ozi rule .",
    "differences in the kinematics ( besides trivial phase - space effects ) induced , for example , by the mass difference between the @xmath2- and @xmath0 mesons , interference effects between the nucleonic and meson - exchange currents , etc . , are completely ignored .",
    "our model offers the possibility to test explicitly the validity of this assumption and thus the reliability of eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) . for this purpose we carried out a ( full ) model calculation where we imposed the ozi rule to relate the relevant coupling constants ; i.e. , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "in addition , we used the same form factors at the @xmath2- and @xmath0-meson production vertices in the mesonic and the nucleonic current , respectively .",
    "it turned out that such a calculation yields results that are qualitatively very similar to the simple estimate of eq.([ratio ] ) , indicating that the above - mentioned differences in the kinematics , etc .",
    ", do not induce any significant deviation from eq.([ratio ] ) .",
    "in fact , the cross section ratio taken at the same excess energy is roughly @xmath192 , or about 30% smaller than the  naive  ozi estimate .",
    "we have investigated the reaction @xmath29 using a relativistic meson - exchange model .",
    "we find that the nucleonic and @xmath33 exchange currents are the two dominant sources contributing to @xmath0-production in this reaction , and that they interfere destructively .",
    "since these two reaction mechanisms give rise to distinct angular distributions , measurements of this observable can yield valuable information on the magnitude of the nucleonic current and , specifically , on the @xmath1 coupling constant .",
    "in fact , the flat angular distribution exhibited by the data from disto collaboration @xcite indicates that the contribution from the nucleonic current must be very small .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the value of the @xmath1 coupling constant must also be small .",
    "indeed , our semi - quantitative combined analysis of those @xmath0-meson production data and the data for @xmath2-meson production from saturne yields values of @xmath3 which are compatible with the ozi rule .",
