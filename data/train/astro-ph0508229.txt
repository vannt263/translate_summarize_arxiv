    "( mrk  79 ; @xmath4 ) is an optically well - studied , radio - quiet ( e.g. ho 2002 ) , seyfert 1.2 galaxy ( e.g. pietsch 1998 ) .",
    "numerous black hole mass estimates exist ( e.g. wandel 1999 ; vestergaard 2002 ; peterson 2004 ) which yield a value of @xmath5 .",
    "was observed with  ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) at two epochs separated by six months as part of an agn snap - shot survey , the results of which are presented in gallo ( 2005 ; hereafter g05 ) .",
    "these short observations constituted the first analysis of the x - ray spectrum of  above @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to an iron emission line at @xmath7 , which was detected at both epochs , g05 report the detection of a narrow emission feature at @xmath8 ( rest frame ) during the second ( low - flux ) observation . in this paper",
    "we elaborate the discussion of this @xmath9 feature .",
    "we have scrutinised the reliability of the detection and discuss physical scenarios which could manifest a line - like feature at such energies .",
    "during both observations of  all three epic instruments functioned normally .",
    "the pn ( strder et al . 2001 ) and mos ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner 2001 ) cameras were operated in small window mode with the medium filter in place .",
    "a summary of the observations is provided in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "details of the data reduction ( which were conducted with xmm - sas v6.1.0 ) are given in g05 .",
    ".log of  observations of .",
    "the date and  revolution number when the observation was conducted are given in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "the total amount of useful exposure ( gti ) is shown in column ( 4 ) , and the estimated number of @xmath10 source counts is reported in column ( 5 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     during both intervals the @xmath7 line is present with approximately the same strength and flux ( table  [ tab : inter ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath9 feature is significantly detected only in the first interval .",
    "moreover , there is another narrow spectral feature at @xmath11 , which is also only detected during the first half of the observation .    during the second interval only the @xmath7 emission line",
    "is statistically required .",
    "if we fix a gaussian profile at @xmath12 and another at @xmath1 and fit the data from the second interval , we notice that both lines have decreased in strength by about the same amount ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the strength and flux of the @xmath7 emission line , and the continuum flux and photon index remain constant throughout the observation ( table  [ tab : inter ] ) .",
    "however , the changes in the @xmath14 and @xmath1 features are trends as opposed to significant variations since , within @xmath3 confidence levels , only the equivalent width of the @xmath12 feature is different .",
    "these possible variations suggest that if both line - like features are real they may be related in such a way that they vary simultaneously . since the features are only observed for the first half of the observation it is impossible to estimate how long they were present in the spectrum prior to the onset of the observation .",
    "the high - energy spectral fit parameters for each of the two intervals are shown in table  [ tab : inter ] .",
    "there are several reports of emission lines at energies inconsistent with iron emission .",
    "these features tend to be redshifted to energies between @xmath15 ( e.g. turner 2002 , 2004 ; porquet 2004 ) , and reports of blueshifted emission features are few .",
    "extreme blueshifts , on the order of @xmath16 have been reported in two objects ( yaqoob 1999 ; wang 2003 ) .",
    "both these sources are radio - loud , thus a mechanism to launch material at such velocities can be envisaged .",
    "another blueshifted line was reported at @xmath17 in a radio - quiet , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( ghosh 2004 ) .",
    "there are some possible physical explanation as to why there are more reports of redshifted features than blueshifted ones , though it could simply be that the sensitivity of current x - ray instruments ( i.e.  and ) drops quickly at energies above @xmath18 .        from the chianti v4.2 database ( dere 1997 ; young 2003 ) , we find that an atomic transition arising around @xmath1 originates from h - like ni ( @xmath19 ) . in the time - averaged spectrum ( reported in table  [ tab : cont ] )",
    "the best - fit line energy is formally inconsistent with ni at more than @xmath20 .",
    "however , in the first half of the split spectrum ( table  [ tab : inter ] ) the measured line energy is comparable with .",
    "this raises a second problem in that an extraordinary abundance of nickel is required to produce such a strong line . assuming solar abundances for iron ( anders & grevesse 1989 )",
    ", we estimate that a minimum nickel overabundance of @xmath21 solar is necessary to account for the average flux of the @xmath9 feature over the duration of the observation .",
    "gastaldello & molendi ( 2004 ) suggested an overabundance of nickel , probably due to enrichment from sn  ia ( dupke & arnaud 2001 ) , to explain the excess flux between @xmath22 in the spectrum of the perseus cluster .",
    "this scenario does not seem valid for  for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , the overabundance is quite extreme ( @xmath23 solar ) .",
    "secondly , the @xmath9 in  appears to be variable on various time scales .",
    "flux variations would not be noticed from supernova emission unless there was bulk motion of ejecta , which is at odds with the narrowness of the measured feature . of course",
    ", we can not completely rule out that the environment was enriched at an earlier epoch , and now the variability is due to accretion processes .",
    "thirdly , though not a necessary condition , a ni overabundance does not explain the possible detection of the variable @xmath11 emission line",
    ".      radiative recombination edge and continuum ( rrc ) of ionised iron can result in line - like features above @xmath24 , specifically @xmath25 and @xmath26 for h- and he - like iron , respectively .",
    "the width of the feature reveals the characteristic electron temperature ( @xmath27 ) . for a photoionised plasma",
    "the electron temperature can be significantly less than the ionisation potential ; thus the rrc feature can appear quite narrow ( see reviews by liedahl 1999 ; kahn 2002 ) .",
    "radiative recombination features have been proposed to describe the x - ray afterglow spectra of some gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. yoshida 2002 ; piro 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 feature in  can be well fitted with a rrc ( @xmath28/dof @xmath29 ) with a plasma temperature of @xmath30 .",
    "the observed threshold energy ( taking into consideration the host - galaxy redshift ) would require an outflowing velocity of approximately @xmath31 or @xmath32 , depending on the ionisation state of iron .",
    "the rrc should also be accompanied by a redshifted , ionised , emission line .",
    "unfortunately , the redshifted emission line , regardless of the ionisation , should appear close to , or within , the neutral fe  feature observed between @xmath33 ; thus it is not possible to derive any meaningful limits on a redshifted , ionised line component .",
    "there are a number of examples ( e.g. della ceca 2005 , and references within ) where narrow emission features have been attributed to the `` horns '' of the disc line profile ( fabian 1989 ) .",
    "our attempt to model the feature with a disc line profile resulted in a good fit ( @xmath28/dof @xmath34 ; figure  [ fig : discline ] ) .",
    "the energy of the disc line was fixed to @xmath35 as allowing it to remain free did not enhance the fit .",
    "the equivalent width was @xmath36 .",
    "emission was assumed to be coming from a thin ring between @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the derived disc inclination ( @xmath39  degrees ) is consistent with the optical classification of  as a seyfert 1.2 ( pietsch 1998 ) .",
    "the horns of the disc line profile are observed at @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( observed frame ) , which accurately correspond to the energies of the @xmath1 feature under investigation , as well as the slight excess at @xmath11 seen in figure  [ fig : int ] .    assuming a @xmath5 black hole , implies that the radiation only needs to flash briefly ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is on the same order as the lower - limit established from the apparent variability of the lines in figure  [ fig : int ] .",
    "the effect could be of radiation propagating from the centre shining on an irregularity in disc height , perhaps an inflowing lump or some sort of ridge in the disc .",
    "localised hot spots which illuminate a small portion of the disc ( e.g. doviak 2004 ) could also produce such a narrow feature at @xmath1 .",
    "the possible @xmath12 line seen in figure  [ fig : int ] appears as though it could be displaying similar variability as the @xmath1 line .",
    "if we insist on connecting the behaviour of these two features ( which we do not ) , then it would be challenging to describe both of them as arising under the same physical conditions in the hot spot model .",
    "both red and blueshifted @xmath43 features have been reported in radio - quiet agn ( e.g. nandra 1999 ; matt 2005 ; dadina 2005 ) , and the aborted jet scenario ( ghisellini 2004 ) works well at describing them .    in principle the aborted jet scenario can also describe emission features , but this would imply that the line is being emitted at a large distance from the central region . if attributed to blueshifted iron , the @xmath9 emission line in requires a outflowing velocity between @xmath44 ( depending on the ionisation state of iron ) .",
    "the high velocity measured in the x - rays is inconsistent with velocities seen at other wavelengths .",
    "if we once again suppose that the @xmath1 and @xmath12 features are interconnected we can speculate that both are originating from slightly ionised iron ( @xmath45 ) , and moving in opposite directions , but with the same speed ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the slightly weaker @xmath12 line would be consistent with suppressed emission from matter moving away from the observer .",
    "such a condition could arise in a jet outflow , for example from material which is ejected in both directions at the same time .",
    "such a twin - jet scenario involving emission lines is not unprecedented and has been proposed for the galactic binary ss  433 ( e.g. fabian & rees 1979 ; see brinkmann 2005 for recent x - ray spectra ) .",
    "we presented the analysis of an @xmath1 emission line feature in the seyfert 1.2 , .",
    "we have intensely scrutinised the detection and determine that the feature is significant at a confidence level between @xmath2 , depending on what a priori assumptions are made .",
    "the fact that the feature is blue shifted with respect to iron emission is intriguing .",
    "however , since the exposure was so short ( @xmath0 ) it is not possible to draw substantial conclusions .",
    "the brightness and complexity of the feature make  a worthy target for follow - up observations with , , , and in the future _ xeus_.",
    "based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "many thanks to frank haberl , michael freyberg , wolfgang brinkmann , and gnther hasinger for helpful discussions .",
    "much appreciation to the anonymous referee for providing a very helpful report ."
