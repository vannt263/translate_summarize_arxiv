    "in recent years several studies have investigated the influence of constant uniform electric fields on the localization of electrons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems with on - site randomness . in the absence of dc - fields",
    "it is by now well known that even small amounts of disorder lead to an exponential localization of all eigenstates  @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of a single - orbital tight - binding model of an electron in a periodic potential , application of a static electric field",
    "is known to generate a discrete , uniformly spaced eigenvalue spectrum  @xcite , known as stark ladder , with all eigenfunction localized factorially  @xcite . for weak fields the wavefunctions may be extended over several lattice periods , but with increasing field strength the electron tends to be localized on a specific site .",
    "this is known as stark localization and has been observed experimentally in superlattices @xcite which are commonly used for such measurements  @xcite .    in infinite samples",
    "the localization of eigenstates can be characterized in terms of the localization length ; the latter is commonly defined from the amplitude decay of eigenstates in the limit @xmath6 , where  @xmath7 labels the site in the tight - binding picture . the most powerful and informative method available for such studies is the transfer matrix method . in the presence of a strong electric field , however , it appears to be less efficient due to the factorial nature of the stark localization .",
    "moreover , for finite systems the structure of eigenvectors can not be characterized in the same way .",
    "one then needs to use other quantities ( such as the inverse participation ratio ) , that are valid both for finite and infinite samples . through the use of scaling conjectures",
    ", one can link then the properties of eigenstates in infinite samples to those of finite samples .",
    "since the scaling approach proved to be extremely useful in describing conductance and its fluctuations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) in the theory of disordered solids , it seems natural to use this approach also in order to describe localization properties of eigenfunctions of 1d disordered systems in the presence of constant electric field .    in this paper",
    "we study the 1d anderson model in the presence of a constant electric field in view of scaling properties of its eigenstates .",
    "the main question that we want to answer is whether the up to now known equivalence between quasi-1d and 1d disordered models @xcite can be extended in order to include also systems with constant electric field . for this purpose",
    "we analyze the scaling properties of information lengths for infinite and finite samples , which were used successfully in the studies of one and quasi - one dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the standard anderson case , where the ratio of the anderson localization length  @xmath1 and the sample size  @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath8 , is the only relevant scaling parameter , we find in the present case an additional scaling parameter  @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the stark localization length , which arises from the applied constant electric field .",
    "hence , the structure of eigenvectors in our model is characterized by two scaling parameters @xmath10 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the mathematical model and briefly summarize the known facts about the two limiting cases that appear for our model . in section  3",
    "we discuss different definitions of localization length , which are used in our numerical simulations . in section  4",
    "we present numerical data on scaling of localization lengths of eigenstates in infinite and finite systems .",
    "finally , in section  5 we study the scaling of the whole distribution of eigenvectors .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "our starting point is the 1d schrdinger equation in the tight - binding approximation @xmath11 where  @xmath12 denotes the probability amplitude for an electron to be at site  @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 is the local site energy , @xmath14  is the hopping element , @xmath15 is the electron charge and @xmath16 the strength of the applied dc field . by applying the transformation",
    "@xmath17 one obtains the stationary equation @xmath18 for the eigenvalues @xmath19 and the corresponding eigenstates  @xmath20 .",
    "we can distinguish two limiting cases which are relevant for our study : ( a ) perfect system ( i.e. @xmath21 ) with non - zero electric field @xmath22 , and ( b ) zero field ( i.e. @xmath23 ) with random on - site potential .",
    "+     two representative eigenfunctions of the 1d tight- binding model ( [ tbe ] ) . *",
    "( a ) * stark regime with factorial localization ( @xmath24 ) . * ( b ) * anderson regime with exponential localization ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the dashed line has slope @xmath26 .    in the case of a perfect system with @xmath22",
    ", one can prove that the corresponding eigenstates @xmath27 , known as wannier - stark states , show a generic factorial decay i.e. @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bessel function of order @xmath7 .",
    "wannier - stark states constitute a complete set of energy eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "their eigenvalues , @xmath30 form the so - called wannier - stark ladder  @xcite . a particular wannier - stark state @xmath31 is factorially localized around the @xmath32th site , with a localization length of the order of @xmath33 , i.e. the electric field appears in the denominator of the localization length in eq .",
    "( [ wse ] ) .",
    "this underscores the fact that @xmath16 can not be treated as a small perturbation to the field - free hamiltonian .",
    "an example of such a state is presented in fig .",
    "the other limit of interest corresponds to zero electric field with @xmath13 random and @xmath34-correlated , chosen from a distribution @xmath35 with mean zero and variance @xmath36 .",
    "below , in our numerical investigation we will always assume that @xmath35 is a uniform distribution in @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "such a model is known in the literature as the anderson model  @xcite and has been studied in great detail in the context of disordered materials .",
    "it was shown with mathematical rigor that in the limit of infinite samples this model displays exponentially localized eigenfunctions , no matter how small the disorder is ( see fig .",
    "the rate of decay is measured by the lyapunov exponent  @xmath38 which may be evaluated by the transfer matrix method . to this end",
    ", one has to study the asymptotic behavior of the random matrix product  @xmath39 , where  _ m_@xmath40 is defined through the relation @xmath41 for the vector  @xmath42 with the matrix  @xmath43 known as the transfer matrix .",
    "the localization length @xmath44 is hence the inverse lyapunov exponent  @xmath45 ; the latter is evaluated as the exponential rate of increase of an initial vector  @xmath46 , @xmath47 although the lyapunov exponent  @xmath45 for finite  @xmath3 depends on the particular realization of disorder , for @xmath48 it converges to its mean value @xcite . for the calculations below we have used samples of length @xmath49 for relatively large values of @xmath50 and up to @xmath51 for small values of @xmath50",
    "our interest is dedicated to the structure of eigenstates for infinite as well as finite samples , as we tune the disorder and the electric field strength . unlike the simpler case of infinite samples , however , the meaning of a localization length for finite samples is not clear .",
    "below we follow the approach developed in the theory of quasi-1d disordered solids which is based on the evaluation of multifractal localization lengths ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is the applicability in both finite and infinite samples .",
    "one of the commonly used quantities in this approach is the so - called entropic localization length , defined through the information entropy @xmath52 of eigenstates , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath32th component of an eigenstate in a given basis . for eigenstates normalized as @xmath55 , the simplest case of @xmath56 results in an entropy equal to the maximum value : @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore define the localization length  @xmath58 as the number of basis states occupied by the eigenstate @xmath59 ; the latter is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "we note that in general , the amplitudes @xmath54 fluctuate strongly with  @xmath7 and thus the coefficient of proportionality between @xmath58 and @xmath61 depends on the type of fluctuations .    in order to study the properties of eigenstates in quasi-1d solids , localized on some scale in the finite basis ,",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite to normalize the localization length  @xmath58 in such a way that in the extreme case of fully extended states the quantity  @xmath58 is equal to the size of the basis @xmath3 . in such an approach ,",
    "the entropic localization length @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) the ensemble average @xmath64 is performed over the number of eigenstates with the same structure and over realizations of the disorder potential .",
    "the normalization factor  @xmath65 has the meaning of an average entropy of the completely extended random eigenstates in the finite basis . for the quasi-1d case the distribution of components  @xmath31",
    "is assumed to correspond to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )  @xcite .",
    "analogously , a whole set of localization lengths @xmath66 can be defined in the following way  @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the average value of @xmath69 for the reference ensemble of completely extended states .",
    "one should note that for the particular case  @xmath70 the quantity  @xmath71 is known as the participation ratio .    in the context of quasi-1d disordered models in the presence of constant electric field  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that all global properties of eigenfunctions are described by the following localization parameters @xmath72 where the superscript @xmath73 denotes infinite ( finite ) samples , respectively .",
    "moreover it was found that  @xmath74 obey some scaling law , i.e. they depend only on the ratio of the characteristic lengths of the system . in the case of infinite samples only two length scales , i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are relevant . for finite samples , however ,",
    "a third length  @xmath3 , which is the actual size of the sample , comes into play and has to be taken into account in the scaling theory .",
    "according to the scaling conjecture in the modern theory of disordered solids , it was found that for quasi-1d systems in the presence of electric field @xcite the @xmath74 follow the scaling laws : @xmath75    our main question is whether relations of the type of eq .",
    "( [ scl ] ) are also applicable for our 1d anderson tight - binding model with electric field . in refs .",
    "@xcite is was shown analytically that the eigenstates in 1d and quasi-1d disordered systems _ without _ electric field , possess the same gross structure ( envelope ) on scales comparable with the localization length , while their statistical properties are quite different on a much finer scale of the order of the lattice spacing .",
    "that is the reason why many scaling laws , which are dominated by the fluctuations of the envelope , hold both for 1d and quasi-1d .",
    "the validity of such a statement is however questionable in the presence of electric fiels .",
    "we will show that such a similarity between quasi-1d and 1d disordered systems persist also in this case .",
    "the first nontrivial question in this context arises about the reference ensemble for the computation of the average entropy @xmath65 . indeed , in application to 1d anderson type models @xcite",
    "the reference ensemble can not be chosen as an ensemble of full random matrices , like the goe .",
    "this point is related to the fact that in the 1d tight - binding case fully extended states are not gaussian random functions but just plane waves which arise for zero disorder . in the presence of electric field ,",
    "the situation is even more complicated due to strong dependence of the eigenstates on the electric field .",
    "however , and this is our expectation , in spite of the above mentioned differences , scaling properties of the eigenstates of the 1d model ( [ tbe ] ) are of the generic type discovered for quasi-1d systems .",
    "for this reason and in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , we define the normalization factors @xmath65 and @xmath68 from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ tbe2 ] ) for zero disorder and electric field , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath23 @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the entropy @xmath65 and the participation ration @xmath79 of the above eigenstates in the large  @xmath3 limit has the same value for every eigenvalue  @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81",
    "in this section we analyze the scaling properties of eigenstates of infinite systems . in numerical studies",
    "the matrices are obviously of finite size @xmath3 . however in our analysis below we will always consider the case that @xmath82 , and thus the finite ( but large ) size of the matrix becomes irrelevant .",
    "we therefore have used these data to investigate our scaling assumption for @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "( [ betaq ] ) ) .    as was mentioned in section  ii the introduction of a non - zero electric field @xmath84 , results in an additional length scale @xmath2 .",
    "this length arises when we consider a cross section of the energy band locally tilted by the electric field : @xmath85 for an energy level @xmath86 therefore the scaling parameter @xmath87 enters the problem .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the localization lengths @xmath88 of eqs .",
    "( [ l1]),([lq ] ) as the typical length , which contains most of an eigenvector normalization , we expect that @xmath89 i.e. the exponentially localized states progressively becomes localized factorially as the field increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for weak electric field we have @xmath90 , and thus the dominant localization mechanism , i.e. the one that produces the shortest localization length scale , is the one related to the randomness . from now on we will refer to this as the `` anderson regime '' . in the opposite limit @xmath91 ,",
    "the dominant localization mechanism is due to the electric field .",
    "we will refer to this regime as the `` stark regime '' .",
    "based on the previous considerations we expect that the @xmath92 s have the following scaling form , ( see also ref .",
