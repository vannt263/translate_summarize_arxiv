    "it is thought that many young star clusters show ` mass segregation '  where the massive stars are more centrally concentrated than lower - mass stars ( see section  2 for a review of current methods for detecting mass segregation ) .",
    "there are two possible origins of mass segregation in star clusters .",
    "it may be dynamical , in that mass segregation evolves within an initially non - mass segregated cluster due to dynamical effects @xcite .",
    "or it may be primordial , where mass segregation is an outcome of the star formation process @xcite .",
    "information about the presence and degree of mass segregation thus provides strong constraints on star cluster formation and evolution . however , there are currently no good methods by which mass segregation can be determined and quantified absolutely .",
    "this seriously limits the interpretation of observations of mass segregation , and especially our ability to compare different clusters .",
    "in this paper we present a new method , based on the minimum spanning tree , which allows us to quantify the degree of mass segregation in a cluster , and examine how mass segregation changes with stellar mass . in section  2",
    "we review the limitations of current methods of determining mass segregation . in sections  3 and",
    "4 we introduce our new method and test it against a number of artificial clusters and the onc . in section  5",
    "we discuss the method s limitations and some ways in which it might be improved , and we summarise our results in section  6 .",
    "in this paper we will take as a working definition of mass segregation that _ the most massive stars are not distributed in the same way as other stars_. in particular , that they have a more concentrated distribution .",
    "this is not the only possible definition of mass segregation . it would be possible to define mass segregation as a significant difference in the mass functions ( mfs ) at different positions in a cluster",
    "indeed , this is often the way mass segregation is currently defined ( see section  [ sec : currentmethods ] ) .",
    "however , we feel such a definition is problematic as it raises the question of how many stars need to be included in order to properly sample the mf and therefore tell if two mfs are different . also , how much do the mass ranges sampled need to overlap in order to differentiate mf slopes",
    "? both of these questions are difficult to answer without assuming a mf a priori .",
    "the current methods can be loosely separated into two groups , those that involve fitting a density profile and characteristic radii to various mass ranges ; and those that trace the variation of the mf with radius .",
    "none of the current methods to examine mass segregation give a model independent , quantitative measure of the amount of mass segregation in a cluster ( and most are not quantitative at all ) .",
    "the current methods of determining the presence of mass segregation also rely on a determination of the centre of the cluster , which in itself may be very difficult to define .",
    "density profiles are usually fitted with a model profile ( e.g. a king ( 1966 ) model ) or as a cumulative distribution function for different mass ` bins ' .",
    "this allows the variation in distribution to be easily seen , and the ` degree ' of mass segregation can be measured by the change of the slope of the distribution function . from these distributions",
    "characteristic radii for each mass bin ( e.g. core radius ) can be found .",
    "this method has been used in many studies @xcite .",
    "however , the accuracy of this method has been brought into question by @xcite , who show that this method is highly dependent on the number of mass bins , the size of the bins , and on the models used to fit the density profile . @xcite",
    "use a method which is similar to comparing cumulative distributions .",
    "they study the amount of mass inside a projected radius and obtain a quantifiable measure of the degree of mass segregation from the area between this curve and a curve for a cluster with no mass segregation .",
    "however , this relies on having a model for a non - mass segregated cluster .",
    "@xcite use the variation of the ` spitzer radius ' ( the spitzer radius is the r.m.s .",
    "distance of stars in a cluster around the centre of mass ) with luminosity to determine the presence of mass segregation .",
    "a variation of the mf with radius will show the presence of mass segregation as a shallowing of the slope of the mf with radius @xcite .",
    "mass functions are calculated for various annuli , such that in a mass segregated cluster the radii closest to the centre of the cluster will contain the most massive stars , and so they will have shallower slopes than those at larger radii .",
    "this method also suffers from a strong dependence on the choice of annuli and mass bins for the mf @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that a unique set of annuli to use for comparison is not simple to choose because of the variation of the shape and slope of the mf as the choice of bin size changes for individual clusters .",
    "a particular problem is that low - mass stars are often difficult to detect in the central regions leading to relatively small regions of overlap in the mfs at different radii ( which are the slopes to be compared ) .",
    "a further complication is introduced by the fact that the cluster centre must be determined ; it is generally chosen as where the luminosity is highest - i.e. where the massive stars are .",
    "in this section we detail our new method for defining and quantifying mass segregation using a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "the mst of a sample of points is the path connecting all points in a sample with the shortest possible pathlength , which contains no closed loops ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the length of the mst is unique , but the exact path might differ in some special circumstances .",
    "for example , an equilateral triangle of stars named 1 , 2 , and 3 has two possible msts  one connecting stars 1 & 2 and 2 & 3 , and one connecting stars 1 & 2 and 1 & 3 .",
    "but the lengths of both msts are identical .",
    "we have used the algorithm of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to construct our msts .",
    "we construct an ordered list of the separations between all possible pairs of stars .",
    "stars are then connected together in ` nodes ' starting with the shortest separations and proceeding through the list in order of increasing separation , forming new nodes as long as the formation of the node does not create a closed loop .",
    "following our definition of mass segregation ( see section  [ ssec : whatms ] ) we can detect and quantify mass segregation by comparing the typical mst of cluster stars with the mst of the most massive stars .",
    "the method is based on finding the mst of the @xmath4 most massive stars and comparing this to the mst of sets of @xmath4 random stars in the cluster .",
    "if the length of the mst of the most massive stars is significantly shorter than the average length of the msts of the random stars , then the massive stars have a different , and more concentrated , distribution  hence the cluster is mass segregated .",
    "the ratio of the average random mst length to the massive star mst length gives a quantitative measure of the degree of mass segregation with an associated error ( i.e. how likely it is that the massive star mst is the same as that of a random set of stars ) .",
    "the algorithm proceeds in the following way :    _ 1 .",
    "determine the length of the mst of the @xmath5 most massive stars ; @xmath6_. the mst of a subset of the @xmath7 most massive ( or what ever subset is of interest ) stars is constructed .",
    "this mst has length @xmath6 .",
    "_ 2 . determine the average length of the mst of sets of @xmath5 random stars ; @xmath8_. sets of @xmath5 random stars are constructed , and the average length , @xmath8 of their msts is determined .",
    "there is an dispersion associated with the average length of the random msts which is roughly gaussian and so can be quantified by the standard deviation of the lengths @xmath9 .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that @xmath10 random sets is sufficient to obtain a good estimate of the errors . however using hundreds of random sets",
    "tends to result in smoother trends .",
    "we suggest using @xmath11  @xmath12 random sets for low @xmath5 and at least @xmath10 for high @xmath5 .",
    "note that the error @xmath13 on @xmath8 is always large for small @xmath5 due to stochastic effects when randomly choosing a small number of stars ( see section  [ sec : msclusters ] ) .",
    "_ 3 . determine with what statistical significance @xmath14 differs from @xmath8_. we define the ` mass segregation ratio ' ( @xmath15 ) as the ratio between the average random path length and that of the massive stars : @xmath16 where an @xmath15 of @xmath17 shows that the massive stars are distributed in the same way as all other stars , an @xmath15 significantly @xmath18 indicates mass segregation , and an @xmath15 significantly @xmath19 indicates inverse - mass segregation ( i.e. the massive stars are more widely spaced than other stars ) .",
    "the more ( significantly ) different the @xmath15 is from unity , the more extreme is the degree of ( inverse-)mass segregation .",
    "_ 4 . repeat the above steps for different values of @xmath5 to determine at what masses the cluster is segregated , and to what degree at each mass .",
    "_ clearly , the choice of @xmath20 is arbitrary , so the @xmath15 needs to be determined for many values of @xmath5 to gain information on how the degree of mass segregation changes with mass .",
    "this method has three major advantages over current methods .",
    "firstly , it gives a quantitative measure of mass segregation with an associated significance , allowing different clusters to be directly compared .",
    "secondly , it does not rely on defining a cluster centre or any special location in a cluster ( allowing it to be applied to highly substructured regions as well ) .",
    "thirdly , it is applicable not just to the most massive stars , but to any subset of stars ( or brown dwarfs ) that one might think has a different distribution to the ` norm ' .",
    "it should be noted that whilst we are applying our method to simulated data and therefore know the mass of each star , an absolute determination of the mass is not required , just a measure of the relative masses ( i.e. luminosity ) .",
    "we tested the method on a large sample of plummer spheres @xcite consisting of 1000 single stars with masses sampled from a kroupa initial mass function @xcite .",
    "the masses are assigned randomly to stars so these clusters should not be mass segregated ( except by chance ) .    tables  [ tab : randplummer3d ] and  [ tab : randplummer2d ] show the fractions of random clusters that are found at @xmath21 significance to be either inverse - mass segregated ( inverse - ms : @xmath22 ) , mass segregated ( ms : @xmath23 ) or that showed no mass segregation ( no ms : @xmath15 @xmath17 ) for various numbers of members in the mst ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : randplummer3d ] uses the 3d positions of the stars , table  [ tab : randplummer2d ] is for a 2d projection as would be observed . in both the 2d and 3d clusters",
    "we find that false positives and negatives ( i.e. @xmath15 @xmath25 from unity ) occur with equal frequency around @xmath26th of the time  exactly what would be expected if the error is gaussian .",
    ".the percentage of plummer spheres which show evidence of inverse - mass segregation ( inverse - ms ) , mass segregation ( ms ) , and no mass segregation ( no ms ) for various numbers of members in the mst , @xmath24 , in 3 dimensions .",
    "[ tab : randplummer3d ] [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     it is clear from tables  [ tab : msplummer3d ] and  [ tab : msplummer2d ] that the ability of the method to detect mass segregation depends on a combination of the level of mass segregation and the number of stars in the mst . in the first column ,",
    "when @xmath27 the method is able to detect mass segregation at roughly @xmath28 significance when the % ms is low .",
    "as it only uses the 5 most massive stars to look for mass segregation , it is not good at finding mass segregation when the % ms involves hundreds of stars .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath29 ( i.e. half of the stars in the cluster ) , the method is poor at spotting when the mass segregation only involves a few stars .",
    "however , it becomes extremely good when finding mass segregation involving many hundreds of stars .",
    "looking across tables  [ tab : msplummer3d ] and  [ tab : msplummer2d ] , the highest significances for finding mass segregation ( up to 10 or 15@xmath30 results ) occur when @xmath5 is equal to the number of stars that have been mass segregated .",
    "the best results are for large @xmath5 as the variance in @xmath8 is smallest when @xmath5 is large .",
    "note that , as mentioned above , when @xmath5 is small the variance in @xmath31 is large due to stochastic effects .    therefore , it is vital to vary @xmath5 in order to examine mass segregation .",
    "however , this is an important diagnostic tool , as variations of @xmath15 and its significance with @xmath5 contain information about how , and down to which mass mass segregation is found .",
    "with @xmath5 for a plummer sphere with an initial 5 percent ms .",
    "the dashed line indicates @xmath15=1 i.e. no ms . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmstmspl05 ] we show the variation of the @xmath15 with @xmath5 for a 5 per cent level of mass segregation ( i.e. the 50 most massive stars are segregated ) .",
    "the @xmath15 is around @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and then drops sharply toward unity when @xmath34 .",
    "this shows two features of mass segregation that can be extracted using this method .",
    "firstly , it shows that only the @xmath10 most massive stars are mass segregated ( as described above ) .",
    "however , it also shows that the @xmath10 most massive stars are _ equally _ mass segregated .",
    "that is , the method places the @xmath10 most massive stars at the centre of the cluster but does not order them in any specific way within the centre .",
    "with @xmath5 for a plummer sphere with an initial 1 per cent and 7 per cent ms .",
    "the dashed line indicates @xmath15=1 i.e. no ms . ]    to illustrate this we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmst.2mspl ] the variation of the @xmath15 with @xmath5 for a cluster in which the @xmath35 most massive stars are placed in the inner @xmath36 per cent radius , and the @xmath37th to @xmath38th most massive stars in the @xmath36  @xmath39 per cent radius .",
    "the method clearly detects that there are two levels of mass segregation ",
    "one involving the 10 most massive stars , and one which involves the 70 most massive stars .",
    "we also apply the method to a more realistic and complex cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] we show a complex 1000-body cluster .",
    "the triangles show the positions of the 5 most massive stars and the squares the positions of the 6th to 12th most massive stars ( the reason for these choices will be explained below ) .",
    "interestingly , the cluster has collapsed into a configuration in which the 5 most massive stars form a dense trapezium - like cluster to one side , and the 6th to 12th most massive stars have formed a separate ` clump ' on the other side . for this reason the cluster has no well - defined centre which serves to illustrate the strength of the mst method in dealing with unusual and clumpy clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmstcomplex ] we show the change of the 2d @xmath15 with @xmath5 for the cluster illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] . fig",
    "[ fig : nmstcomplex ] shows that in this cluster there are 3 ` levels ' of mass segregation .",
    "_ firstly _ , there is the presence of a trapezium - like system formed from the five most massive stars ( with an @xmath15 of around 12 ) . _",
    "secondly _ , there is another system , containing the 6th to 12th most massive stars , which shows significantly less mass segregation than the trapezium - like system ( an @xmath15 of around 4 ) .",
    "_ thirdly _ , the 50 most massive stars in the cluster show a steadily decreasing degree of mass segregation . beyond the 50th most massive star",
    "the cluster shows no evidence for mass segregation at all .",
    "we note that the second clump was not obvious in our initial ` eyeballing ' of the simulation .",

    "the dashed line indicates an @xmath15 of unity , i.e. no mass segregation . ]      finally , we apply the method to real data , specifically the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) data of @xcite .",
    "we use the 900 stars for which @xcite provide masses .",
    "we note that this is not an ideal dataset as many ( presumably low - mass ) stars lack masses .",
    "however it serves to illustrate the method .",
    "@xcite show , using cumulative distribution functions and mean stellar mass as a function of radius , that the onc is mass segregated .",
    "they find evidence for mass segregation in the onc for stars more massive than 5 @xmath2within 1 pc , with less compelling evidence beyond this radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : nmstonc ] shows the change of @xmath15 with @xmath5 for the onc .",
    "the mst method clearly picks out the mass segregation of the trapezium system at @xmath40 with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the mst method also shows that there appears to be a secondary level of mass segregation involving the 9 most massive stars ( @xmath41 @xmath2 ) in the onc in agreement with @xcite . whilst the significance of the @xmath15 is low ( around @xmath42 )",
    ", there is a clear trend in that each of the 5th to 9th stars show the same increased level of mass segregation .",
    "however , unlike @xcite we find no evidence of mass segregatation below 5 @xmath2 .",
    "in future papers we will apply our new method to more observational and theoretical data to look for mass segregation , and also to examine if low - mass stars have different distributions to brown dwarfs and/or high mass stars .    _",
    "binaries_. in our tests we have not included binary stars , and they will have an effect on the lengths of msts . if a binary is resolved , then it is very likely that the two components will be linked as a node ( if this is not the case it would be unclear that the system really was a binary ) .",
    "indeed , triples and quadruples will also be linked as a subset within the mst .",
    "this raises the possibility that msts could be very useful in locating binary and multiple systems by looking for short links within the mst .",
    "however , as noted by cartwright & whitworth ( 2005 ) care must be taken in dealing with binaries .    _",
    "incompleteness_. in many clusters there is significant incompleteness , especially in regions around the most massive stars where low - mass stars can not be observed ( if they are present ) .",
    "this presents a significant problem as it is impossible to know if there are many low - mass stars in the ` central ' regions .",
    "if there are , then an average mst length would be short .",
    "if not , it would be long ( this is exactly the same problem faced by other methods ) .",
    "we will explore this problem in a future paper by creating and analysing synthetic observational datasets .",
    "we have outlined a new method of determining and quantifying mass segregation in a cluster by using a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) .",
