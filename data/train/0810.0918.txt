    "the co - added epic pn spectrum of the high flux state was fitted in the 2 - 10  kev band with a power law continuum and a narrow ( zero - width ) gaussian line to account for emission in the fe k@xmath1 line at 6.4  kev .",

    "the non - zero width of the fe line may indicate the presence of additional emission components from a higher ionisation state .",
    "we tried to fit the data with two zero - width gaussians around 6.4  kev and 6.67  kev ( mean energy of the fe  xxv triplet ) .",
    "the fit statistic is @xmath32@xmath33/d.o.f.=290/224 , slightly worse than the broad gaussian fit , but the parameters for the fe xxv line are affected by large uncertainties ( e=6.56@xmath230.62  kev and flux=1.34@xmath34@xmath210@xmath28  photons  @xmath4  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the evidence for the presence of a complex profile or of two fe line components in this spectrum is nonetheless very loose , so we assume the model with a single narrow gaussian fe line to compare directly the two spectral states ( see section 4 ) .",
    "when this model is extrapolated below 2 kev , the data present soft x - ray residuals , therefore two warm absorbers with ionisation parameters and column densities initially fixed to the a06 values have been added in the fit .",
    "the model zxipcf available in xspec as local model was used .",
    "based on xstar , this model was originally developed to describe the effect of a partial covering from ionised matter ( reeves et al .",

    "the two spectra are very similar in shape and flux intensity .",
    "the spectral shape in figure  [ fig : two_epochs ] suggests that the drop of counts from the high state could be due to absorption in the 1 - 6  kev band .",
    "we therefore start by analysing the longest spectrum ( nov06 ) and by constructing a model where the 2002 best fit is absorbed by neutral gas .",
    "the addition of a cold column density to account for the absorption ( model zphabs , already described in the previous section ) does not provide a good description of the data ( @xmath26/d.o.f.=896/233 ) .",
    "it seems that the nuclear primary continuum is not totally suppressed , but it still contributes to the soft x - ray spectrum , therefore a partial covering absorber is considered .",
    "the partial covering is constructed by adding a power law convolved with the zphabs and cabs components in xspec .",
    "the latter is necessary to produce a correct estimate of the continuum normalisation by taking into account compton scattering by optically thin gas .",

    "the remarkable transition to a low flux state uncovers a prominent iron emission line complex ( see figure  [ fig : k_alpha ] ) , suggesting that compton reflection could also contribute to the hard x - ray emission .",
    "we therefore added a pure compton reflection pexrav component ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) assuming solar abundances and a 30@xmath41 inclination of the reflecting material to the observer line of sight .",

    "the parameters for the detected fe lines are reported in table  [ tab : low_bfit ] .",

    "the effect of the soft x - ray absorbers is still very evident in the data , so the same warm absorbers used for the high state are included in the model .",
    "an additional gaussian line is required to fit residuals around 0.9  kev and it has been included in the fit ( @xmath35@xmath32@xmath33=83 for 2 free parameters ) .",
    "this model provides a satisfactory fit for nov06 and it was then applied to aug06 .",
    "the best fitting parameters for both spectra are reported in table  [ tab : low_bfit ] .",
    "the two spectra are in very good agreement , therefore we can safely assume that the source was not affected by significant spectral change between august and november 2006 .",
    "the drastic change in the x - ray emission could also be explained if the primary emission simply drops , letting only the reflected spectrum be observable ( matt et al .",
    "this hypothesis is tested by fitting the november data with a pexrav component to account for the hard x - ray spectrum , and a single power law to model the soft x - ray excess . the warm absorber components and all the gaussian lines reported in table  [ tab : low_bfit ]",

    "when applying the low state model to these data and after fixing the column density to 8@xmath210@xmath3  @xmath4 ( i.e. the low state value ) , the upper limit on the covering fraction is about 5  percent .",

    "the absence of a fe  k@xmath1 broad relativistic component and the lack of fe k variability seem to point to a scenario in which the compton reflection occurs on the parsec - scale torus - shaped material expected to be present in seyfert galaxies ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "the fe line intensity measured with respect to the reflection component is ew=460@xmath61  ev in the high state and ew=510@xmath2355  ev in the low state .",

    "determining more detailed properties of the system such as the precise time scale for the transit of the cloud or a characteristic size , appears very difficult since h0557 - 385 was observed very sparsely by x - ray observatories .",
    "the closest look to the _ xmm - newton _ ones , is an asca observation of 1995 ( turner et al .",
    "1996 ) which shows the source at high state . in the attempt to find additional x - ray data ,",
    "h0557 - 385 has been searched for in the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey images ( saxton et al .",
    "2008 ) ; luckily , one recent slew ( 25/02/2008 ) passed through the coordinates corresponding to the agn ( saxton , private communication ) .",

    "this implies that the size of the x - ray source must be very compact compared to that of the uv source .",
    "highly obscured agn constitute an excellent laboratory to study the physical properties of the circumnuclear gas via soft x - ray spectroscopy of emission lines produced in the interaction between such gas and the primary nuclear emission ( guainazzi & bianchi 2007 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the high resolution cameras did not provide a detection for h0557 - 385 at low state and so the source does not have the wealth of additional spectral information that was available for other seyfert  1 caught at low state , e.g. mrk  335 ( longinotti et al .",

    "in addition to the neix line , the 6.6  kev emission line identified as fe xxv in the low state spectrum could also be a signature of photoionisation .",
    "however , the statistical quality of these measurements prevent us from drawing any firm conclusion on the origin of these spectral features",
    ".    detecting soft x - ray emission ( both lines and continuum ) may lead to interpret h0557 - 385 at low state within the typical seyfert 2 scenario ( bianchi et al . 2006 ; guainazzi & bianchi 2007 ) .",
    "remarkably , the presence of the same two phase - warm absorber in _ both _ states plays a key role in ruling out this scenario .",
    "it provides a very robust argument against the `` seyfert 2/scattering '' scenario and consequently , in favour of the partial covering .",
    "the fact that the warm gas is still visible through the absorption at low state , implies that the soft x - ray emission does not come from an extended region as the nlr in obscured agn ( it would be very unlikely to have a warm absorber at such large scale ) .",
    "accordingly , the soft x - ray emission must have been only partially reduced by the obscuring event , as also suggested by the comparison of the power law normalisations , and therefore it is still observable at low state .    the fact that the seyfert  1 nucleus remains visible at low state makes the spectral transition in h0557 - 385 a very interesting event , which resembles the occultation phenomenon seen in the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc1365 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) , but it is the presence of the warm absorber what makes h0557 - 385 a unique case where the partial covering scenario is indeed very robust and can be challenged only if other spectral states were observed .",
