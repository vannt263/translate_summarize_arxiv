    "processes in which a liquid wets or dewets a solid surface are ubiquitous throughout industry and nature .",
    "they are known as dynamic wetting flows @xcite . flows from this class",
    "occur , for example , when a liquid - gas meniscus propagates through a tube ( figure  [ f : wetting]a ) and during the spreading of liquid drops over solid surfaces ( figure  [ f : wetting]b ) . in industrial applications , dynamic wetting flows are usually referred to as ` coating flows ' , emphasizing the technological objective to ` coat ' the solid substrate with a liquid .",
    "one can distinguish between discrete wetting , as for ink - jet printing @xcite , and continuous coating , where the liquid is deposited as a continuous film @xcite , e.g.  using a liquid curtain falling onto a moving solid substrate ( figure  [ f : wetting]c ) .",
    "it is well established that controlling the dynamics of wetting is critical to the manufacture of a defect - free coating at an optimal speed @xcite .",
    "manipulation of the wetting dynamics is often achieved by introducing additional physical effects which either alter the surface tension of an interface such as , for example , surfactant transport @xcite or influence both the interfaces and the bulk @xcite .",
    "a defining feature of flows involving dynamic wetting is that , as confirmed by numerous experiments , e.g.  @xcite , the free surface meets the solid boundary at an angle @xmath0 , known as the ` contact angle ' , which is less than @xmath1 ( figure  [ f : wetting ] ) . as a result , mathematically , one faces a problem of finding a solution in a domain with a non - smooth boundary with different boundary conditions for the bulk equations of fluid mechanics on the two boundaries that form the contact angle @xcite .        from the modeling viewpoint ,",
    "the difficulties are two - fold .",
    "firstly , regardless of the contact angle value , there is no solution to the navier - stokes equations that would simultaneously satisfy all classical boundary conditions on the free surface and the solid boundary @xcite .",
    "this nonexistence of what would be a ` classical solution ' for dynamic wetting problems ( in a weaker formulation also described in terms of a non - integrable shear - stress singularity ) came to be known as the ` moving contact - line problem ' @xcite .",
    "the second difficulty in the modelling of dynamic wetting phenomena is that the value of the contact angle , which provides a boundary condition for the equation describing the free - surface shape and hence is vital for finding the configuration of the flow domain , depends not only on the speed at which the liquid - fluid - solid contact line moves across the solid surface but , as experiments show , also on the flow field in the vicinity of this contact line @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to model dynamic wetting and be able to incorporate this effect , one has to accurately describe the flow near the moving contact line .",
    "theoretical works that aim at modelling the process of dynamic wetting as a solution to a clear - cut closed mathematical problem ( see @xcite for a review ) invariably preserve the contact angle , and hence a piecewise smooth boundary of the flow domain , and focus on formulating boundary conditions that would resolve the moving contact - line problem , i.e.  allow for the existence of a solution ( or , in a weaker formulation , make the shear stress integrable ) . in the vicinity of the moving contact line , the ` extra ' physics that kicks in and has to be incorporated into the boundary conditions to resolve the problem makes it necessary to generalize the no - slip condition on the solid surface to allow for slip , i.e.  a difference between the tangential to the solid component of the liquid s velocity and that of the solid .",
    "the simplest example is the navier slip condition @xcite in which slip is proportional to the tangential stress acting from the liquid on the liquid - solid interface .",
    "the complexity of free - boundary problems with moving contact lines makes it almost inevitable that numerical methods are required .",
    "if the free surface position and evolution are to be tracked explicitly and with high accuracy , it is advantageous to use an arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ( ale ) finite element method ( fem ) in which computational nodes on the free surface evolve with it whilst those in the bulk move in some other specified manner that prevents the elements from degeneration .",
    "this method easily handles complex geometries , allows for a natural incorporation of boundary conditions formulated in terms of stresses and has been successfully used to describe a variety of free - boundary flows , e.g.  @xcite .    in applying numerical methods , including the fem , to dynamic wetting flows , one encounters two main difficulties : ( a ) the characteristic length scale over which the classical boundary conditions have to be altered , i.e.  in which the no - slip condition is violated , is much smaller than the scale associated with the bulk flow and ( b ) the boundary conditions that are applied on the two parts of the boundary that form the contact angle , i.e.  on the free surface and the solid , are of different type .",
    "the disparity of length scales in dynamic wetting problems is usually so large that any attempt to resolve both scales using a numerical method with a fixed spatial resolution will inevitably produce a computationally intractable problem .",
    "consequently , previous numerical implementations of dynamic wetting models split into two groups : those that explicitly attempted to resolve the smaller length scale using specially designed meshes , e.g.  @xcite , and , the majority , where no such attempt was made .",
    "the consequence of each interface having different types of boundary conditions is that the contact line , where the two interfaces meet and the contact angle must be specified , does not fit naturally into the numerical scheme . in the fem literature",
    "many different schemes have been proposed for the contact line implementation and , as discussed in detail in this work , many of them give different results for the same problem .",
    "a priori , it is unclear , both qualitatively and quantitatively , how the aforementioned difficulties affect the accuracy of a numerical scheme and how localized to the contact line any errors will be . to resolve these issues ,",
    "we develop a computational framework which both fully captures the dynamics of slip and allows the contact line to be incorporated in a natural way .",
    "then , this numerical tool is used to examine previous approaches and provide guidelines for future investigations .",
    "there is a large body of literature on the use of the fem to simulate fluid flow @xcite , and it is well known how to accurately incorporate liquid - fluid free surfaces into this method , e.g.  @xcite . in this paper , we complement these works by providing a detailed exposition , including practical recommendations , of a framework for incorporating dynamic wetting phenomena in a regular way into a fem scheme .    in  [ equations ] ,",
    "we give the equations of a basic , representative , model of dynamic wetting .",
    "the standard fem approach to solving the governing equations is then outlined in  [ fem ] .",
    "it is then described how previous works have attempted a number of different computational approaches to incorporate the dynamic wetting process . in ",
    "[ new1 ] , we present a new framework which , by implementing the boundary conditions on the liquid - solid interface in a methodologically similar way to that used on the free surface , allows the contact line to be incorporated into the finite element procedure in a natural way . in the main body of the text the new approach is constructed so that it may be applied in an arbitrary coordinate system and is not dependent on the specific features of the fem scheme , e.g.  mesh design , which have been chosen . in the appendix , we describe , in a step - by - step user - friendly guide , our fem implementation in detail for the cases of two - dimensional and three - dimensional axisymmetric flow .",
    "in  [ example ] we consider a representative example : the steady propagation of a liquid - gas meniscus through a capillary tube .",
    "this allows us to validate the new implementation against analytic results for specific flow regimes and check the convergence of the code as the spatial resolution of the fem mesh is increased .",
    "the code allows one to critically analyze previous numerical implementations of dynamic wetting models , compare them to the new one and provide practical quantitative recommendations for future code development .    in  [ surf ]",
    ", we use the new framework to show how ` additional ' surface physics can be naturally incorporated into the fem procedure and the effect which the dynamics has on the flow .",
    "finally , in  [ conclusions ] , we summarize our findings and suggest future directions of research .",
    "consider the steady spreading of a newtonian liquid , with constant density @xmath2 and viscosity @xmath3 , over a chemically homogeneous smooth solid surface .",
    "the liquid is surrounded by a gas which , for simplicity , is assumed to be inviscid and dynamically passive , of a constant pressure @xmath4 .",
    "let the flow be characterized by scales for length @xmath5 , velocity @xmath6 , pressure @xmath7 and external body force @xmath8 . in the dimensionless form ,",
    "the continuity and momentum balance equations are then given by @xmath9 where @xmath10,\\ ] ] is the stress tensor , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the liquid s velocity and pressure , @xmath13 is the external force density and @xmath14 is the metric tensor of the coordinate system .",
    "the non - dimensional parameters are the reynolds number @xmath15 and the stokes number @xmath16 .",
    "boundary conditions to the bulk equations are required at the liquid - gas free surface @xmath17 , whose position is found as part of the solution , and at the liquid - solid interface @xmath18 , whose position is known ; @xmath19 are the coordinates that parameterize the surfaces .    on the free surface",
    "the kinematic condition of impermeability is @xmath20 hereafter , @xmath21 is the unit normal to a surface pointing into the liquid , and subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the free surface and solid surface , respectively .    in",
    "what follows , it is convenient to introduce a ( symmetric ) tensor @xmath24 , which is essentially a metric tensor on the surface .",
    "if an arbitrary vector @xmath25 is decomposed into a scalar normal component @xmath26 and a vector tangential part @xmath27 ( the subscript @xmath28 henceforth denotes the tangential component of a vector ) , so that @xmath29 , we can see that , because @xmath30 , the tensor @xmath31 extracts the component of a vector which is tangential to the surface , i.e.  @xmath32 . then , @xmath33 is the two - dimensional gradient operator playing the same role on the surface as @xmath34 does in the bulk .",
    "the classical boundary conditions for the tangential and normal stress on the free surface can now be written down as @xmath35\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{i}-\\mathbf{n}_1\\mathbf{n}_1\\right ) + \\frac{\\nabla^{s}\\sigma_1}{ca } = \\mathbf{0},\\qquad -p+ \\mathbf{n}_1\\cdot\\left[\\nabla\\mathbf{u}+\\left(\\nabla\\mathbf{u}\\right)^t\\right]\\cdot \\mathbf{n}_1=\\frac{\\sigma_1\\nabla^s\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_1}{ca}.\\ ] ] here , the superscript @xmath36 denotes the transposition , @xmath37 is the surface tension of the interface and the capillary number @xmath38 is based on its equilibrium value @xmath39 .",
    "the pressure in the liquid is considered relative to its value @xmath4 in the gas .",
    "the solid is considered rigid , impermeable and moving at velocity @xmath40 , so that at the liquid - solid interface the standard form of the navier - slip boundary condition , which in the present formulation replaces the condition of no - slip , is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the non - dimensional coefficient of slip is defined as the inverse of what we have chosen , e.g.  @xcite ] .",
    "the no - slip condition is recovered in the limit @xmath43 . the first term in ( [ ss_alt ] ) represents the tangential stress acting on the interface and may be rewritten , to keep a consistent notation , in terms of @xmath44 , so that conditions ( [ ss_alt ] ) take the form @xmath45 the differential term @xmath46 in the normal stress equation ( [ fsa ] ) indicates that this equation requires its own boundary condition where the free surface terminates , i.e.  at the contact line , where @xmath47 is prescribed provided that one specifies the contact angle @xmath0 at which the free surface meets the solid surface : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is determined by the ( known ) shape of the solid , the contact angle @xmath0 is specified by a particular model ( or simply prescribed ) and consequently @xmath47 may be determined and provides a boundary condition for the normal stress equation ( [ fsa ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ ns ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ kin ] ) , ( [ fsa ] ) , ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ angle ] ) are the ` conventional ' ones to describe flow near a moving contact line . although the shortcomings of these conventional boundary conditions as a mathematical model for dynamic wetting are well known ( see , for example @xcite ) , as far as numerics is concerned , the described formulation is a necessary intermediate step towards implementing more sophisticated models .",
    "next , we shall show how the fem converts the outlined continuous problem into an approximate discrete one which may be solved computationally to a desired degree of accuracy .",
    "in this section , we will briefly recapitulate some of the main elements of the fem , which is required in what follows as well as in the appendix where a step - by - step implementation of the developed procedure is given .",
    "the defining feature of the fem is that the computational domain @xmath50 is tessellated into a finite number of non - overlapping elements , each containing a fixed number of nodes at which the functions values are determined . between these nodes the functions",
    "are approximated using interpolating functions whose functional dependence on position is chosen .",
    "let @xmath51 be the total number of nodes in @xmath50 at which the pressure is determined , @xmath52 be the number of nodes at which the velocity components are to be found and @xmath53 be the number of nodes on the free surface @xmath54 .",
    "the functions are approximated as a linear combination of interpolating functions each weighted by the corresponding nodal value .",
    "this gives a trial solution of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the interpolating functions and the asterisk is used to distinguish the approximate representations from the exact solution ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the interpolating functions are constructed so that they take the value one at the node with which they are associated @xmath60 and zero at all the other nodes to ensure that ( @xmath61 ) are nodal values .",
    "note that here we use roman letters for the indices ( @xmath62 , etc ) to refer to the nodal values and approximating functions spanning the whole domain ( globally ) ; in the appendix , where all the numerical details are given , these indices will be used alongside italicized ones ( @xmath63 , etc ) , which will refer to local , element - based , values and functions .",
    "it is not necessary to use the same level of approximation for the shape of the free surface and the velocity on it , but it is assumed here . in practice , each interpolating function is constructed in an element - by - element fashion and will only be non - zero over a handful of elements : this procedure is described in the appendix but is not required for the following exposition .",
    "the representation @xmath64 of the actual solution @xmath65 is not exact and hence the substitution of ( [ approxn_global ] ) into the governing equations ( [ ns])([stens ] ) and the kinematic boundary condition ( [ kin ] ) will result in errors ( the @xmath66 s ) : @xmath67 @xmath68 = r^{m,\\alpha } , \\qquad \\mathbf{p}^{\\ast } = -p^{\\ast}\\mathbf{i}+\\left[\\nabla\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}+\\left(\\nabla\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}\\right)^{t}\\right],\\ ] ] @xmath69 where the unit basis vectors of the coordinate system @xmath70 have been used to obtain scalar equations .",
    "hereafter , the superscript @xmath71 will be used for quantities associated with the continuity of mass equation , @xmath72 for the momentum equations and @xmath73 for the kinematic boundary condition .",
    "we have chosen to use the kinematic condition on the free surface ( [ kin ] ) as the equation which determines the surface s position , as opposed to the normal stress condition ( [ fsa ] ) which is shown in  [ weakform ] to be incorporated into the weak form of the momentum residuals .",
    "then , given these three equations ( [ goveqn1])([goveqn3 ] ) the problem becomes symmetric with respect to the boundary conditions : on each interface , i.e.  the free surface and the solid boundary , two boundary conditions are applied .",
    "henceforth , we shall drop the asterisks and realize that all functions to be considered represent approximate solutions to the problem .",
    "the aim is to minimize the errors spatially over the entire domain . in the method of weighted residuals @xcite on which the fem is based , this is achieved by minimizing a weighted spatial average of the error .",
    "specifically , we multiply a given error by an arbitrary test function ( the weight ) @xmath74 and integrate the equation over the corresponding domain . applying this procedure to all errors",
    "creates the so - called residual equations . for the bulk equations this requires integration over @xmath50 whilst for the kinematic equation integration",
    "is over the entire free surface @xmath54 , so that the residuals to be considered are @xmath75 insisting that these integrals vanish @xmath76 for _ all _ test functions , of which there are infinitely many , creates the so - called _ weak form _ of the ( strong form ) governing equations of  [ equations ] .",
    "a link between the weak and strong forms is provided by the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations which states that if certain equation - specific constraints on the test functions are satisfied , such as continuity and boundedness , and the relations above hold for all such test functions , then an approximate solution which is continuous will be exact , i.e.  a solution of the strong form , see @xcite for specific details . in practice",
    "we choose a finite set of test functions to generate a discrete set of equations for the nodal values of the functions , which , it is expected , will approximate the continuous problem as closely as required .",
    "it is useful to think of an equation associated with each node as ` determining ' the nodal value of a function there .",
    "mathematically , this is crude , but numerically it is helpful , and we henceforth use the word ` determine ' in this sense .",
    "specifically , the @xmath51 continuity of mass equations can be thought of as determining the @xmath51 pressure nodal unknowns , the @xmath52 momentum equations in each coordinate direction determine the @xmath52 velocity nodal unknowns in that direction and the @xmath53 kinematic equations on the free surface determine the @xmath53 nodal unknowns which specify the free surface shape ( see the appendix for a specific free surface representation ) .",
    "to discretize the equations , one has to replace the infinite set of test functions , the @xmath74 s , by a finite set @xmath77 which spans the solution space as completely as possible . in the galerkin method",
    "this is achieved by choosing the test functions to be the same interpolating functions used for our variables .",
    "specifically , the interpolating function of a given variable is the same as the test function for the equation which determines that variable s value , so that @xmath78 after substituting the interpolating functions in ( [ approxn_weight ] ) into the expressions for residuals ( [ weakeqn1 ] ) , equations ( [ weakeqn ] ) are transformed into a finite set of algebraic equations @xmath79 in  [ weakform ] , we give specific expressions for these and show how they can be manipulated to allow some of the boundary conditions to be easily incorporated .",
    "as one increases the number of nodes in the domain , the error from approximating a continuous problem with a discrete one should decrease , and this will be checked for the problem in question in  [ convergence ] .    here , _",
    "global _ residuals and functions , i.e.  quantities considered over the entire domain , have been considered . in practice ,",
    "the global interpolating functions are constructed piecewise over elements , i.e.  _ locally _ , as low order polynomials .",
    "then , the global residuals are obtained by summing up contributions from each element . in the velocity - pressure formulation of the incompressible navier - stokes equations , mixed interpolation @xcite , with velocity approximated by a polynomial of degree at least one more than pressure , ensures that the ladyzhenskaya - babuska - brezzi @xcite condition is satisfied .",
    "instead of considering the elements of varying shapes in the global domain , it is useful to map each element onto a _ master element _ over which analysis can be systematically performed : this ensures that the solution to problems in complex domains pose no additional difficulty .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in the appendix , but will not be required in what follows .      in this section , using ( [ weakeqn1 ] ) and ( [ approxn_weight ] ) the discretized weak form of the governing equations ( [ weakish ] ) is presented and it is shown how the boundary conditions are applied .",
    "functions appearing in the residuals are approximated using ( [ approxn_global ] ) .",
    "the continuity of mass ( incompressibility of the fluid ) residuals @xmath80 are @xmath81 momentum equations are @xmath82~dv \\qquad ( \\textrm{i}=1\\hbox{--}n_u).\\ ] ] assuming that the interpolating function is at least once differentiable , the stress tensor s contribution can be represented as @xmath83 so that , after applying the divergence theorem , one has @xmath84~dv",
    "+ \\int_{a } \\phi_{\\textrm{i}}\\mathbf{e}_\\alpha\\cdot\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}~da , \\ ] ] where , as before , @xmath21 is the inward normal to the surface @xmath85 which forms the boundary to @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the volume contribution to the momentum residuals is @xmath86~dv,\\ ] ] whilst the contribution to the momentum residual from the surface is @xmath87 in the last expression , only when node @xmath88 is on the surface @xmath85 will @xmath89 be non - zero , i.e.  only nodes on the surface of @xmath50 will give contributions to the momentum residuals via ( [ stress ] ) .",
    "previously , it was described how for each nodal unknown there is an equation which is assumed to determine its value . in all numerical methods , to maintain the equality between the number of unknowns and equations , in applying the boundary conditions we must either ( a ) replace a bulk equation at boundary nodes by an equation representing the discretized form of the boundary condition , or ( b ) manipulate the bulk equations to allow the boundary condition to be incorporated into them .",
    "we refer to ( a ) as an _ essential _ imposition of the boundary condition ; the bulk equation which is replaced is referred to as the _ dropped _ equation .",
    "the ( b)-type implementation of boundary conditions will be referred to as _ natural _ imposition , which , for stress conditions , is made possible by the contribution ( [ stress ] ) that is replaced by the corresponding expression for the stress on a given surface ( the fem is therefore referred to as allowing a natural incorporation of stress - type boundary conditions ) .    on the free surface ,",
    "boundary conditions ( [ fsa ] ) can be combined into a more computationally favourable form @xmath90=\\mathbf{0},\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the surface stress , playing the same role on the surface as @xmath44 does in the bulk , so that ( [ fs ] ) is actually a balance of stress acting on the interface ( first term ) and that acting in the interface ( second term ) .",
    "then , using ( [ fs ] ) , one can rewrite ( [ stress ] ) on the free surface as @xmath92~da_1.\\ ] ] direct calculation of the integrand in ( [ fs2 ] ) would require the evaluation of the derivatives of the vector normal to the surface .",
    "it was initially suggested by ruschak @xcite , and generalized for three - dimensional problems in @xcite , that by using the surface divergence theorem one could obtain an expression in which no such derivatives are required .",
    "lowering the highest derivatives reduces the constraints on the differentiability of the interpolating functions which are used to approximate the free surface shape , i.e.  @xmath93 , and hence allows lower - order polynomials to be used . the required transformation of ( [ fs2 ] ) is given by @xmath94~da_1.\\ ] ] then , using the surface divergence theorem @xcite , which for a surface vector @xmath25 with no normal component @xmath95 is @xmath96 where the unit vector @xmath97 is the inwardly facing normal to the contour @xmath71 that confines @xmath85 ( figure  [ f : angles ] ) , with @xmath98 we obtain @xmath99 thus , on the free surface , the term ( [ stress ] ) in the momentum residual is now split into surface and line contributions @xmath100 with the stress boundary conditions ( [ fs ] ) incorporated .    notably , the same procedure of integrating by parts and using the divergence theorem has been used on both the surface stress term @xmath101 $ ] and the bulk stress term @xmath102 . in both cases , this has created contributions from the boundary of that term s domain , i.e.  the confining contour and surface , respectively .",
    "consequently , the momentum residual now contains a cascade of scales @xmath103 which represent , respectively , the volume , surface and line contributions .",
    "in particular , part of the contour which bounds the free surface is the contact line @xmath104 where the liquid - gas interface meets the solid .",
    "other boundaries to the free surface further away from the contact line , for example an axis of symmetry , are not considered here .    at the contact line",
    ", it is useful to rearrange the term in the integrand of the contour integral in ( [ fs5 ] ) by representing the vector @xmath105 in terms of a linear combination of its components parallel to @xmath49 and @xmath106 ( figure  [ f : angles ] ) : @xmath107 using this to impose the contact angle ( [ angle ] ) , which is a boundary condition for the free surface shape , results in @xmath108 where the normal and tangent vectors on the solid surface are known a - priori . if contact line s tangent vector is @xmath109 , then @xmath110 , with the sign chosen to ensure the inward facing vector @xmath106 is selected .",
    "thus , the contact angle equation ( [ angle ] ) can be applied in a _ natural _ way , that is without needing to drop another equation in order to impose the contact angle condition and thus fix the shape of the free surface at the contact line .     and the liquid - solid surface @xmath111 in the vicinity of the contact line @xmath104 . ]    the kinematic condition residuals @xmath112 complete the residuals on the free surface : @xmath113 thus far , the implementation has been straightforward :",
    "the stress conditions are applied in the weak form of the momentum equation , and their integration by parts allows specification of the angle at which the free surface meets the solid boundary .",
    "this means that momentum equations on the free surface do not need to be replaced in order to apply essential surface or line conditions . in other words ,",
    "all of the bulk equations are applied at every node , to determine the velocity components , with both the free surface stress conditions and the specification of the contact angle fitting naturally into the weak form of the momentum equations .",
    "the kinematic condition is applied as a separate equation to determine the free surface position .",
    "notably , the implementation is independent of the free surface shape , that is the curved nature of the free surface is as easy to handle as , say , a planar surface which aligns with coordinate axes .    on the rigid solid surface , where we have @xmath114 nodes , it is the navier condition and the condition of impermeability ( [ ss ] ) that have to be imposed .",
    "the navier - slip condition is of stress type and hence contributes to the weak form of the momentum equations in a natural way , giving @xmath115 where @xmath116 is an interpolating function for the liquid - solid interface corresponding to the @xmath88th node .",
    "however , the impermeability condition is not of stress type and hence does not fit naturally into the weak form of the momentum equations .",
    "consequently , it is usually applied as an essential condition which creates a new residual equation at each of the nodes on the liquid - solid interface : @xmath117 then , as previously described , in order to retain equality between the number of unknowns and number of equations in the numerical scheme , an equation must be dropped to make room for ( [ ss3 ] ) . as ( [ ss3 ] )",
    "is an equation which determines a component of velocity , and it is the momentum equations that are regarded as determining these , it is a momentum equation that should be dropped .",
    "the dropping of a momentum equation in order to make space for an essential condition is achieved more formally , see e.g.  @xcite , by defining the interpolating functions such that they are zero at nodes at which an essential condition is to be applied .",
    "either way , the end result is exactly the same .",
    "the procedure outlined above is straightforwardly achieved when the solid surface is parallel to a coordinate plane , so that one can drop the momentum equation normal to this plane and apply ( [ ss3 ] ) instead .",
    "the momentum equations tangential to the boundary only require an expression for the tangential stress and this is provided by the navier - slip condition . if the solid surface is not parallel to a coordinate plane , then , so as not to favour one of the axes , before applying the boundary conditions one must project the momentum equations at each node on the surface so that they are tangent and normal to it @xcite .",
    "this is not a complex procedure , but it is considerably more cumbersome , and hence more time - consuming , than that encountered on the free surface , where curved shapes do not cause any additional difficulties .",
    "one can imagine that such a procedure will be computationally intricate when considering flows over topographically complex surfaces where the momentum residuals will have to be projected on different axes at each node .",
    "so far , the weak formulation of the bulk equations has been derived and it has been shown how the boundary conditions on the liquid - gas free surface and the liquid - solid interface are implemented . additionally , it was shown that the contact angle may be naturally imposed by specifying a contribution to the momentum equations from the contact line .",
    "so , on the liquid - gas free surface all momentum equations are applied , with stress - type boundary conditions naturally imposed , as well as the kinematic condition , whereas on the liquid - sold interface one momentum equation was dropped in order to apply the essential condition of impermeability .",
    "next , we consider what happens when we reach the nodes at which these interfaces , which , as described above , are treated in methodologically different ways , meet at the contact line .",
    "ideally , one would use an implementation which allows all the boundary conditions from both sides of the contact line to be applied in addition to the contact angle specification at the contact line .",
    "however , it will be shown that a count of the number of equations and unknowns indicates that this is not possible .",
    "consequently , in the method as it stands , one has to favour certain boundary conditions over others to arrive at an equality between equations and unknowns .    to make the argument most transparent ,",
    "consider as an example the free surface meeting a solid which is parallel to the @xmath118-axis and motion occurs in the @xmath119-plane of a cartesian coordinate system with the liquid below , in terms of @xmath118 , the free surface ( e.g.  see the geometry of figure  [ f : sketch ] ) .",
    "in this geometry , the free surface can be represented , for example , as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the arclength along it , so that in the discretized form @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) are the unknowns that determine the free surface s position .",
    "the incompressibility equation is applied at every node and determines the pressure . at every node of the liquid - gas free surface",
    "both momentum equations are used , with the stress boundary conditions applied naturally , for the components of velocity @xmath124 , and one kinematic condition is applied for the free surface unknown @xmath125 . on the liquid - solid interface",
    "the @xmath118-momentum equation is applied to determine @xmath126 , with the navier boundary condition applied naturally , whilst the @xmath66-momentum equation is dropped to allow the essential impermeability condition , @xmath127 , to be satisfied .    at the contact line , node @xmath128",
    ", we have unknowns @xmath129 , with @xmath130 corresponding to the @xmath118-coordinate of the contact line .",
    "application of the @xmath118-momentum equation , to determine @xmath131 , allows both the navier boundary condition along the solid and the @xmath118-projection of the stress conditions on the free surface to be imposed .",
    "this is a good start , but there are now three equations left - the @xmath66-momentum equation , the kinematic condition on the free surface and the impermeability condition on the solid surface - for only two unknowns @xmath132 .",
    "the conventional solution to this difficulty is to favour the latter two equations and not apply the @xmath66-momentum equation at the contact line .",
    "this is in keeping with the usual fem approach of replacing bulk equations wherever essential boundary are applied .",
    "however , the equations at the contact line now enforce the @xmath118-projection of the free surface stress boundary condition but not the @xmath66-projection .",
    "furthermore , the contact angle specification is no longer applied into the @xmath66-momentum equation at the contact line . using ( [ fscl ] ) and noting that @xmath133 and @xmath134",
    ", the contribution from the contour integral in ( [ fscl ] ) to the @xmath118-momentum equation at the contact line will be @xmath135    in  [ previous ] , implementations of the contact line in fem codes known in the literature are discussed . in all these cases , as above , at least one momentum equation is not applied at the contact line .",
    "this type of implementation , in which equations are dropped at the contact line , will be referred to as type a and in this framework the following two different implementations of the contact angle specification have been developed :    * the contact angle is imposed naturally , as described above , using ( [ fscl ] ) ( whilst one momentum equation is dropped already ) . *",
    "the contact angle is imposed as an essential condition ( with one more momentum equation also dropped ) .",
    "exactly the same methodological issues arise in fully three - dimensional flow simulations .    before reviewing previous works that use the fem to simulate dynamic wetting flows , with particular attention to the development of different implementations of the contact angle , it is necessary to make a remark concerning the different ` contact angles ' now involved in the modelling .",
    "when the contact angle specified in the mathematical model is incorporated into the fem code in a natural way , i.e.  absorbed into the contribution to the residual from the contact line , as in the ( a - a ) implementation , there is no guarantee that the contact angle that emerges after computations are performed , i.e.  the angle at which the computed free surface meets the solid boundary , will be equal to the specified one",
    ". we will refer to the angle incorporated naturally into the code , and appearing in the mathematical model , as _ applied _ , and denote it @xmath0 , whereas the contact angle at which the computed free surface meets the solid will be referred to as _ computed _ and denoted as @xmath136 ( figure  [ f : computed ] ) .",
    "in contrast , in the ( a - b ) implementation there is a single equation which ensures that @xmath137 .     differs from the applied angle @xmath0 which appears in the mathematical model . ]",
    "we will now consider the development of the two different fem implementations , ( a - a ) and ( a - b ) in the literature and , in particular , focus on how they appear to produce contradictory results .",
    "this is by no means supposed to be an exhaustive review , rather a pointer to some key papers and their conclusions .",
    "building on early articles considering the fem simulation of free surface flows , for example @xcite , pioneering research into the use of fem to describe the dynamics of coating flows , and hence dynamic wetting phenomena , came from the university of minnesota .",
    "the study of flows with contact lines began by computing static meniscus shapes in @xcite after which problems such as the die - swell phenomenon , with static contact lines , were simulated @xcite , and coating processes involving dynamic contact lines considered in @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of these investigations and the techniques , subsequently used in many works , are as follows .",
    "initially , the minnesota group used the weak formulation to impose the shape of a free surface where it intersected a boundary , i.e.  implementation ( a - a ) .",
    "this appears to have worked well for imposing the contact angle of a static meniscus shape . using this implementation to impose the contact angle in a dynamic wetting problem",
    "was discussed in @xcite . however , in @xcite , it was found that implementation ( a - a ) used in @xcite resulted in the computed angle @xmath136 differing significantly from the applied angle @xmath0 , and this discrepancy , in the worst case , even prevented the numerical scheme from obtaining a solution . to circumvent the problems observed in @xcite ,",
    "it was suggested that _ all _ the momentum equations should be dropped at the contact line to allow the contact angle to be imposed as an essential condition , i.e.  implementation ( a - b ) was proposed .",
    "similar conclusions are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and it appears that this method was henceforth adopted .",
    "these papers appear to be the first in which it is recognized that implementation ( a - a ) does not guarantee that the applied angle will be equal to the computed one .",
    "their conclusion is that implementation ( a - a ) _ must _ be utilized to guarantee that @xmath138 and allow seemingly satisfactory results to be obtained .    in @xcite , an fem code",
    "is designed for the simulation of free surface flows and implementation ( a - a ) is used to specify the contact angle .",
    "this paper is the first to suggest a new interpretation of the phenomenon which the minnesota group had observed . the authors stress that ( a - a ) does not , and should not necessarily , make @xmath136 equal to @xmath0 : the term ( [ fscl ] ) , where the contact angle is incorporated into the weak formulation , merely creates a net interfacial force on the contact line .",
    "the computed angle @xmath136 , which varies from the applied one @xmath0 , is then referred to as the ` dynamic ' contact angle , which , for small capillary numbers , was found to be close to @xmath0 .",
    "this interpretation was adopted in @xcite , where implementation ( a - a ) was used in studies of drop impact and spreading phenomena .",
    "as the drop spreading process commences , with the initial computed contact angle at @xmath139 , for early times there is a huge , unavoidable , difference between @xmath0 ( in the model it is assumed that @xmath0 is a constant which in all cases is less than @xmath140 ) and @xmath136 . from these publications",
    "the idea emerged that the dynamic behaviour of the _ computed _ angle , which differs from the ( constant ) applied one , is a physical effect , despite the fact that there is no @xmath136 in the original mathematical formulation of the problem whose solution the code is supposed to describe .    in all of the aforementioned papers ,",
    "the fem mesh has been designed to capture the general characteristics of the bulk flow , and the region near the contact line is given no special treatment .",
    "in particular , there is no attempt to capture the dynamics of slip , which approximately occurs on the ( non - dimensional ) slip length @xmath141 , by placing a number of elements within this distance of the contact line sufficient to resolve this region .",
    "the articles use what is referred to as ` numerical slip ' , which broadly refers to numerical schemes where slip is only prescribed , often in a couple of elements adjacent to the contact line , to ensure that the nodes at the contact line are not pinned to the solid by the no - slip condition . in other words , slip is used as a numerical convenience and no attention is paid to the extra physics which it introduces that occurs on a length scale greatly smaller than the elements used .",
    "given that the region of numerical slip depends on the size of the elements adjacent to the contact line , the results of such computations are obviously mesh - dependent .",
    "an alternative approach is to create a special mesh which allows small elements to be placed around the contact line and the slip dynamics to be captured .",
    "this is achieved in @xcite where the propagation of a liquid - fluid meniscus through a capillary tube is considered . in @xcite ,",
    "implementation ( a - a ) is used , whilst in @xcite the normal - stress boundary condition is used to iterate the free surface position with the contact angle applied as an integral constraint on the pressure level , i.e.  it is not imposed as an essential condition . in @xcite , it is reported that the computed angle @xmath136 was within @xmath142 of @xmath0 and in @xcite no significant deviation is noted .",
    "these results appear to suggest that , if sufficiently small elements are used near the contact line , so that the dynamics of slip is well resolved , then the weak formulation can indeed be used to impose a specified contact angle .    even in recent papers , there is still much disagreement over which approach is correct .",
    "for example , in @xcite approach ( a - a ) is used , with the computed angle , which differs from the applied one , interpreted as the dynamic contact angle ; whereas , say , in @xcite the implementation ( a - b ) is taken , with all the momentum equations dropped at the contact line .",
    "variance also exists in whether or not the dynamics of slip is resolved : some authors design special meshes to do so , e.g.  in @xcite , whilst in many other publications the region of slip is under - resolved either because of constraints on computational power , as could be the case for three - dimensional simulations , or simply because this phenomenon is not considered important .",
    "previous investigations show that when a ` standard ' mesh is used , i.e.  one which does not incorporate smaller elements near the contact line , implementations ( a - a ) and ( a - b ) certainly create different solutions : in case ( a - a ) it has been established that @xmath136 deviates from @xmath0 imposed via the weak formulation , whereas in ( a - b ) the contact angle is imposed as an essential condition at the expense of dropping another of the momentum equations at the contact line , so that it is unclear whether or not the imposition of @xmath138 creates problems with the accuracy elsewhere in the scheme . the deviation of @xmath136 from @xmath0 which was observed when using ( a - a ) has been attributed to the fact that the implementation only imposes a net interfacial force at the contact line , but , as far as we are aware , there has been no thorough convergence studies performed to see if the contact angle varies as the mesh is refined and whether additional mesh fineness in the immediate vicinity of the contact line has an influence on the flow further away .    what has been presented",
    "thus far broadly summarizes the popular implementations used in the literature .",
    "however , a closer look at previous works reveals even more sub - varieties of implementation .",
    "for example , in implementation ( a - a ) it is usually the projection of the momentum equation tangent to the solid surface which is retained ; however , in @xcite the projection of the momentum equation onto the free surface s normal is chosen .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , instead of applying the impermeability equation separately on the free surface and the solid surface at the contact line , i.e.  creating two fem residual equations , the two were combined to form one impermeability residual with contributions from the two surfaces .",
    "encouragingly , this created room in the formulation to apply both momentum equations at the contact line alongside the ( one ) impermeability equation .",
    "however , it was observed that using this approach resulted in an @xmath143 velocity at the contact line , which violated the requirement that both the free surface and the solid surface were impermeable . implementation ( a - b ) was then adopted to overcome this issue . no doubt , other variations exist and clearly the implementation options at the contact line are plentiful .    by now , it is unclear as to which implementation of the above , if any , is correct , what effect the dominant parameters in the contact line implementation @xmath42 and @xmath144 have on the seemingly contradictory outcomes and how the spatial resolution of the mesh influences the results . in the next section ,",
    "we describe an approach which ensures that both the liquid - solid and liquid - gas interfaces are treated in a methodologically similar way so that the contact line does not present an obstacle to the numerical implementation .",
    "this approach does not contain any loose - ends at the contact line and hence does not allow for creativity on the part of the user .",
    "after rigorously validating our numerical code we will use it to address the aforementioned issues and provide practical advice for future code development .",
    "in the two implementations ( a - a ) and ( a - b ) that have been described and which are both frequently used in the fem literature , at least one of the momentum equations is dropped at the contact line .",
    "consequently , some of the naturally imposed stress - type boundary conditions and line contributions are dropped . by now , it is unclear whether these droppings at the contact line will cause the numerical scheme to produce a spurious solution or whether there will be an influence on the speed of convergence of the code towards a correct solution . to see",
    "if this is the case , we develop a new implementation which requires no equations to be dropped at the contact line and thus allows us to examine how dropping equations at the contact line influences accuracy . to achieve this",
    ", we will outline a known , but rarely used , method for incorporating boundary conditions on the liquid - solid interface and show , for the first time , how this gives a perfect framework for incorporating the contact line .",
    "it was shown in  [ weakform ] that the stress boundary conditions on the free surface are incorporated naturally into the weak form of the momentum equations .",
    "the kinematic condition ( [ kin ] ) is then the extra equation to determine the free surface shape .",
    "however , because the solid surface s shape is prescribed , on the liquid - solid interface the normal stress is determined as part of the solution , as opposed to appearing in a boundary condition which would slot into the weak formulation",
    ". consequently , there appears one less unknown on the liquid - solid interface than on the liquid - gas interface and hence an equation needs to be dropped to enable the essential boundary condition of impermeability of the solid surface equation to be satisfied . in other words , when the surface s shape is prescribed , the normal stress condition can no longer be applied and the kinematic condition plays the role of the second boundary condition for the navier - stokes equations . clearly then , because the free surface and the solid surface are handled in different ways , the contact line where they join will have to be specially treated .    in order to eliminate the asymmetry between the two interfaces , an extra unknown , denoted @xmath145 ,",
    "is introduced into the scheme ; this unknown will be equal to the normal stress at the liquid - solid interface @xmath146 the introduction of @xmath145 as an extra unknown makes it possible to reinstate the momentum equation normal to the solid surface at all nodes on the liquid - solid interface : all momentum equations will then be applied everywhere . in other words , on the _ free _ surface all momentum equations are applied with the impermeability condition used to determine the ` extra ' unknowns specifying the _ position _ of the free surface , and now we have that all the momentum equations are also applied on the _ solid _ surface where the geometric constraint of the prescribed shape allows the impermeability condition to be used to determine the ` extra ' unknown @xmath145 , i.e.  the _ normal stress_. as a result , the free surface and the solid boundary appear to have been treated in the same way and hence , once the two boundaries meet at the contact line , the contact line conditions can be implemented naturally , without dropping any of the equations there .",
    "the new unknown is non - dimensionalized using the characteristic scale @xmath7 and then approximated using the velocity interpolating function on the liquid - solid interface , so that @xmath147 then , after splitting the stress into components normal and tangential to the solid @xmath148,\\ ] ] and applying the navier boundary condition (    [ ss ] ) as before , the contribution from the liquid - solid interface to the momentum residuals ( [ stress ] ) becomes @xmath149~da_2,\\ ] ] with the first and second terms in the integrand associated with the normal and tangential stresses , respectively .",
    "now , on both interfaces all momentum equations are applied to determine the velocity components and the extra kinematic - type equation determines the additional unknowns @xmath150 or @xmath145 .",
    "the new approach introduces a significant simplification , at the expense of relatively few additional unknowns , when the solid surface is not parallel to a coordinate axis : instead of having to project the momentum equations in the normal and tangential directions to the surface , to allow the impermeability condition to be applied , no additional work is required as all equations are applied everywhere in a coordinate - free manner .",
    "this is particularly advantageous for the solid surface with complex topography .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to implementations of type a , all momentum equations are applied at the contact line , with contributions to the momentum residuals from each interface , so that the contact line equations no longer require special attention . in other words ,",
    "the new approach allows the contact line to naturally fuse the liquid - solid and liquid - gas interfacial equations so that there is no scope for options on how the equations are implemented at the contact line , i.e.  there are no ` loose ends ' .",
    "this will be referred to as an implementation of type b :    * all momentum equations are applied at the contact line and the contact angle is imposed naturally into the weak form using ( [ fscl ] ) .",
    "the realization that this particular implementation of the boundary conditions on the liquid - solid interface allows the contact line to be handled naturally is new ; however , the idea of introducing additional unknowns on the liquid - solid interface has been well documented .",
    "building on the ideas of babuska @xcite , the method was considered by verfrth @xcite for implementing slip conditions , and it was shown that @xmath145 is the lagrange multiplier of the impermeability equation ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to the situation with pressure , which is well known to be the lagrange multiplier of the incompressibility constraint , as , in both cases , modelling assumptions ( zero mach number / rigid solid ) result in a variable ( @xmath12/@xmath145 ) being determined by an equation in which it does not appear ( incompressibility / impermeability ) . in @xcite , it is shown , for a case in which there are no contact lines , that results obtained from the approach of dropping the normal momentum and replacing it with the impermeability condition converge to the same computational results as the lagrange multiplier approach .",
    "lagrange multipliers are also used in @xcite to impose both the liquid - liquid free surface and the far - field boundary conditions . in @xcite , for the problem of flow over a backward facing step on which a slip boundary condition is applied , it is shown that the best results are produced when the lagrange multiplier is approximated with the same basis functions as the velocity , as we have chosen to .",
    "the method described above ensures that contact lines may be treated in a methodologically consistent way with no equations dropped and hence no loose ends that leave room for user intervention and can lead to the myriad of approaches described in  [ previous ] .",
    "now we shall investigate the accuracy of the new implementation , and then compare its results to those obtained using previous implementations ( a - a ) and ( a - b ) .",
    "the new implementation , as well as the ones considered in previous works , have been incorporated into the fem scheme described in the appendix .",
    "first , results from the new implementation are compared to those obtained from asymptotic analysis .",
    "having confirmed the accuracy of the scheme , a practical guide to the spatial resolution which numerical schemes modelling dynamic wetting phenomena require is given in  [ convergence ] after which the previous approaches are examined in  [ exam ] .",
    "as a representative dynamic wetting flow , consider the steady propagation of a liquid - gas meniscus through a cylindrical capillary tube .",
    "this flow configuration has the advantage that the geometry is simple and that published results , which agree with each other , exist from spatially well resolved fem schemes @xcite .",
    "axisymmetric cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath119 are used with the @xmath118-axis along the centre of the tube and pointing towards the gas ; azimuthal symmetry about this axis is then assumed ( figure  [ f : sketch ] ) .",
    "the characteristic length @xmath5 and velocity scale @xmath6 are provided by the radius of the capillary and the speed at which the meniscus propagates , respectively .",
    "the solution is computed in a frame in which the contact line is stationary , so that in this frame the solid , which is located at @xmath151 , moves with velocity @xmath152 .",
    "the bulk equations are ( [ ns ] ) , with the standard free - surface conditions ( [ kin])([fsa ] ) , the navier - slip and impermeability conditions ( [ ss ] ) and new normal stress specification ( [ lambda ] ) at the liquid - solid interface , and the contact angle condition ( [ angle ] ) , with a prescribed velocity - independent value of @xmath0 , at the contact line whose location is ( 1,0 ) .",
    "the surface tension of the free surface takes its constant equilibrium value of @xmath153 .",
    "additional boundary conditions at the axis of symmetry @xmath154 are @xmath155 and the condition of smoothness on the free surface shape at @xmath154 that @xmath156 .",
    "boundary conditions in the truncated far field at @xmath157 are provided from the assumption that the flow is fully developed @xmath158 where @xmath159 are the components of velocity in the axisymmetric coordinate system , and if we have no - slip @xmath160 the usual poiseuille profile is recovered . for a similar problem , in @xcite",
    "it is noted that extending the truncated far - field further than two and a half radii away from the contact line did not alter their results . as the main interest here lies in the computational aspects near the contact line anyway",
    ", the truncated far - field is placed at @xmath161 and the issue is not considered further .",
    "the implementation of the boundary conditions ( [ sym ] ) and ( [ far ] ) into the finite element procedure is carried out in the conventional way with the stress conditions incorporated naturally into the weak formulation and the dirichlet conditions applied instead of momentum equations as essential conditions .",
    "new variables could have been introduced on these boundaries to ensure the momentum equations are always applied , but the implementation of the conditions on these boundaries into the fem is not the focus of this paper .          to obtain estimates on the values of the similarity parameters ,",

    "finally , an estimate for @xmath169 often used in the literature for newtonian fluids @xcite , is that @xmath170 .",
    "this gives that @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and external forces are neglected so that @xmath174 .",
    "for simplicity and transparency , we consider acute contact angles to avoid the spurious numerical behaviour encountered , and then resolved , in @xcite for obtuse angles .",
    "in particular , @xmath175 is taken as a base state .",
    "initially , we shall consider stokes flow , i.e.  @xmath176 , to allow for a comparison with asymptotic results .",
    "after confirming the accuracy of our approach , we consider more numerically challenging flows where the reynolds number is non - zero and the capillary number is such that the free - surface becomes heavily deformed .      to confirm the accuracy of our numerical results it will be useful to compare them to local asymptotics derived in the limit @xmath177 where @xmath178 are polar coordinates centred at the contact line with the angular coordinate measured from the solid surface through the liquid ( figure  [ f : sketch ] )",
    "such an analysis can be found , for example , in @xcite .",

    "consider typical parameter values @xmath193 .",
    "figure  [ f : cap ] shows the corresponding streamlines and the mesh which was used for the computation .",
    "it can be seen that the motion of the solid causes fluid nearby to be dragged down and consequently , to ensure continuity of mass , this is replenished by a flow of fluid up the centre of the capillary .",
    "the free surface is relatively undeformed and appears to be close to its static shape , i.e.  a spherical cap which meets the solid at the given contact angle .",
    "as one zooms in on the contact line region , it can be seen in figure  [ f : cap_zoom ] that the domain is approximately a wedge of angle @xmath194 .",
    "it is also apparent that the fem mesh has significant spatial resolution , so that , the dynamics of slip , on the ( non - dimensional ) length scale of @xmath195 , is well resolved as the smallest element has size @xmath196 .",

    "[ f : ca_com ] , the influence that the capillary number has on the free surface shape is shown . for @xmath200 the free surface shapes are graphically indistinguishable and represent the spherical cap one would expect a static meniscus to form . as one increases the capillary number , the apex of the free surface moves from below ( @xmath201 ) the contact line height to above it ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "on the scale of the whole capillary radius the free surface does not seem heavily deformed ; however , zooming in on the contact line region ( figure  [ f : ca_com ] ) reveals that the free surface actually makes an angle @xmath175 in all of these cases .",

    "it appears that this can always be achieved when the mesh has sufficiently small elements near the contact line . to quantify this claim , we study the computed contact angle and , as a measure of the entire free surface shape , the difference in height @xmath205 between the contact line @xmath206 and the apex @xmath207 for a range of meshes of increasing resolution , characterized by the smallest element size @xmath208 , for @xmath209 .",

    "allows a solution to be obtained whose free surface is wildly different from the converged solution .",
    "this is despite the smallest element still being over one hundred times smaller than the radius of the capillary , i.e.  being what one could easily interpret as ` relatively small ' .",
    "this serves as a representative example of the dangers of computing a solution on a mesh which is not specially designed to simulate dynamic wetting phenomena and then employing implementation ( a - b ) to ` compensate ' for this and ensure a ` solution ' is produced .    as previously discussed , when the computed contact angle does not equal the one imposed in the weak form , it is tempting to impose the contact angle as an essential condition .",
    "this is because it is very easy to observe that the computed angle does not equal the applied one , more easy than , say , observing that the stress conditions on the free surface are not well satisfied near the contact line .",
    "however , what we have found is that the computed angle not equalling the imposed one should be interpreted by the user as a warning sign : the mesh is under - resolved . as seen from our results , attempting to bypass this problem by imposing the contact angle as an essential condition actually _ increases _ the global error of the scheme .",
    "qualitatively , our conclusions are similar to the general remark made in the famous paper of gresho & lee @xcite , `` do nt suppress the wiggles - they re telling you something '' , where it is warned that artificially suppressing spurious numerical artifacts merely shifts the generated error to another , less observable , part of the computed solution .",
    "we see , that when the contact angle is imposed naturally via the weak formulation , the deviation of @xmath136 from @xmath0 actually provides a simple quantitative error control on the numerical scheme .",
    "the error should not be suppressed by enforcing the angle as an essential condition , as this only exasperates errors in less easily observable parts of the scheme .",
    "one could insist that the computed angle is , say , within @xmath211 of the applied value and , from the results obtained above , in the parameter range considered , this would provide a very accurate numerical scheme .",
    "this is an idea which we now examine in order to provide practical quantitative recommendations for the spatial resolution required at given values of @xmath144 and @xmath42 .      using the aforementioned criterion that @xmath136 is within a chosen distance from @xmath0 , we will now determine the required spatial resolution for given parameter values . at lower capillary numbers , roughly @xmath212 ,",
    "it is observed that the main constraint on a mesh - independent solution comes from the need to resolve the velocity field which varies on the ( non - dimensional ) length @xmath141 near the contact line .",
    "the computed angle is seen to be within @xmath213 of the applied value before this spatial resolution is achieved .    at higher capillary numbers , where the interfacial curvature is high close to the contact line , the required spatial resolution must be determined . to quantify the results of the numerical experiments , we determine the size of the smallest element @xmath208 that will ensure the computed contact angle is within @xmath211 of the imposed one , in this case @xmath194 .",
    "the results are summarized in the table below .     & & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + & @xmath217 & @xmath218 & @xmath219 & @xmath220 + & @xmath221 & @xmath219 & @xmath222 & @xmath223 + & @xmath22 & @xmath224 & @xmath225 & @xmath226 +    a general trend can be seen that for higher @xmath144 and @xmath42 it is required that @xmath208 is smaller , i.e.  more spatial resolution is needed . surprisingly , in this range of values , a simple empirical formula provides a good estimate for @xmath208 : @xmath227 .",
    "it is important to remember that this is only applicable for large values of @xmath144 , whereas for small @xmath144 we still need to resolve the velocity field and this guarantees the closeness of @xmath136 to @xmath0 . in practice , to ensure that the velocity field is resolved , we require that at least @xmath228",
    "so that , finally , one needs @xmath229 the linear dependence of @xmath208 on @xmath230 can be rationalized by recalling that the local asymptotic result ( [ fs_asymp ] ) predicted that the deviation of the free - surface from wedge - shaped ( @xmath231 ) near the contact line is proportional to @xmath232 .",
    "thus , it is this product that determines the length scale on which the curvature of the free surface becomes significant and consequently on what scale the smallest element needs to be to ensure accurate results .",
    "we also considered the smallest element required for a @xmath233 error in the computed contact angle and found that increasing the coefficient of proportionality by a factor of ten to @xmath234 gave a good estimate for @xmath208 .",
    "the above results can be used as a practical guide to the spatial resolution required to ensure accurate simulation of dynamic wetting flows .",
    "it is apparent that very small elements are required near the contact line which can only be obtained in a computationally tractable way by using a specially designed mesh .",
    "as we have seen , without this special attention to the contact line region the error in the computed solution can be huge .",
    "this will apply not only to the fem but also to other numerical methods which , with a few exceptions ( e.g.  @xcite ) , rarely incorporate the spatial resolution shown to be imperative for the recovery of meaningful results .    in this section",
    ", we have fully resolved all issues surrounding the numerical implementation of a contact line at which an arbitrary angle is imposed .",
    "we now consider if the contact angle can be specified on the basis of physical considerations and how the resulting equations fit most naturally into the fem framework which has been developed .",
    "the contact angle is a boundary condition for the normal stress equation on the free surface , and , thus far , it has been considered as a prescribed input to the model .",
    "now we will look into the ` extra ' physics which actually determines its value , and examine the resulting effects on the flow .",
    "the contact angle is introduced into macroscopic fluid mechanics by the young equation @xcite , which expresses the balance of the surface tension forces on the contact line acting tangentially to the solid surface : @xmath235 here , @xmath37 and @xmath236 are the surface tensions acting on the contact line from the free surface and the liquid - solid interface , respectively , with the surface tension on the gas - solid interface being zero .",
    "thus , the only way in which the contact angle @xmath237 can vary , i.e.  be dynamic in the model and not as an artifact of numerics , is if at least one of the surface tensions varies from its equilibrium value @xmath39 and @xmath238 , respectively .",
    "if the surface tensions become variables of the problem , this must be accounted for in the boundary conditions on the interfaces . here , we allow for a dynamic surface tension and , being interested in the numerical implementation of the boundary conditions and for the sake of generality , do not concern ourselves with the mechanism for its variation ( see @xcite for such a mechanism ) .",
    "as it turns out , the equations on the free surface , and their implementation into the fem scheme , already allow for gradients in surface tension .",
    "it is the equations on the liquid - solid interface where the influence of gradients in surface tension is not yet clear .",
    "we will now derive a generalized navier condition by considering a balance of forces on an interface and an equation relating the torque acting on the interface to the velocity difference , i.e.  the slip , across it .",
    "a balance of stresses acting on the liquid - solid interface is @xmath239 where superscript @xmath240 and @xmath241 now denote , respectively , the value of a variable on the liquid - facing side of an interface , which is the value involved in the boundary to the navier - stokes equations ( these variables have been referred to throughout the paper ) , and on the other side , in this case the solid - facing side of the interface , yielded ( [ fs ] ) . ] .",
    "the stress on the solid - facing side of the liquid - solid interface is unknown and , if needed , is determined as part of the solution . instead",
    ", the velocity on the solid - facing side of the liquid - solid interface @xmath40 is known . a link between the two",

    "we arrive at the so - called generalized navier condition @xcite , which has the form @xmath244 and can see that , when the surface tension is a constant , this generalized condition reduces to the standard navier condition ( [ ss ] ) .    using ( [ gennav ] ) , we now have the contribution to the momentum residuals ( [ stress ] ) on the liquid - solid interface given by @xmath245~da_2.\\ ] ] this new formulation has been implemented into our numerical scheme .",
    "the numerical scheme containing the additional physics has been thoroughly tested and gives excellent results . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us examine the same axisymmetric flow in a capillary as considered in ",

    "the equation is well satisfied with curve @xmath22 and curve @xmath23 adding to give curve @xmath259 . from this figure",
    "the relative strengths of the factors which cause slip can be seen : it is the surface tension gradient which is largest for @xmath260 and hence it is able to drive a flow reversal .    in summary",
    ", it has been shown that our new framework is easily generalizable and , in particular , allows interfacial physics associated with dynamic wetting to be naturally incorporated into it .",
    "as has been discussed , a number of different fem implementations have been used to simulate dynamic wetting phenomena .",
    "we have shown that to guarantee accurate results , particularly at higher capillary numbers , sufficient spatial resolution of the computational mesh must be used near the contact line . when this is the case ,",
    "many of the seemingly different implementations , including our own , converge to give the same result . despite these similarities , approaches",
    "in which the weak formulation is used to enforce the contact angle are seen to converge to the correct solution faster . an apparent ` window ' for a numerical error imposing the contact angle using the weak formulation",
    "is seen to actually be an advantage : the difference between the applied angle and the computed one provides a simple quantitative test on the accuracy of the scheme .",
    "this constraint is lost if the angle is imposed as an essential condition whilst the error is shifted elsewhere in the code but not removed . in particular , imposing the angle as an essential condition when using a mesh which does not incorporate sufficient extra spatial resolution near the contact line can lead to huge global errors in the free surface shape .    in the new implementation ,",
    "the momentum equations are applied everywhere and any surface which is curved or does not align with coordinate axes causes no additional complexity .",
    "a key advantage of our framework is that , since there are no ` loose ends ' at the contact line , there are no choices left for a user in how to implement the contact line region .",
    "this , together with the obtained quantitative criterion for the mesh , ensures that the implementation of dynamic wetting phenomena into the fem satisfies the mantra in @xcite that , once the weak form is derived and the choice of mesh design , element type , etc are taken ,  the rest of the recipe",
    "is well defined - just turn the crank to generate the complete spatial approximation \" .",
    "it has been shown that when the weak form is used to impose the contact angle , the computed value on an under - resolved mesh can vary significantly as the mesh resolution is altered near the contact line , and to interpret the computed value , a mesh - dependent quantity , as the dynamic contact angle would be fundamentally incorrect .",
    "if one wishes to define an ` apparent ' angle , that is some measure of the free - surface shape away from the contact line , then this should be a well - defined variable , see e.g.  @xcite , which converges to a specific value as the mesh is refined . in phenomena where the dynamic contact angle starts from an out - of - equilibrium value , e.g.  in drop impact and spreading phenomena , where the angle starts at @xmath1",
    ", it is a fundamental _ modelling mistake _ to prescribe the contact angle to be equal to its equilibrium value . in this case",
    ", the applied angle can not be reconciled with the initial free - surface shape in principle , and the code will be unable to provide mesh - independent solutions for early time .",
    "one may hope that the restrictions on mesh design described in this paper could be relaxed by removing the region near the contact line and , if an appropriate limit is available , incorporating some local asymptotic results there .",
    "this approach has been considered , for example , in @xcite and is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to incorporate the small capillary number asymptotic results of @xcite , which relate the contact angle to the free surface shape at a given distance from the contact line . in both investigations",
    ", it is seen that such an approach fails for @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , there is a limited range of validity to these numerical schemes which prevents them from being used to simulate flows where the capillary number is of order one or higher regularly encountered in processes of technological interest , e.g.  the impact and spreading of liquid drops ejected from ink - jet printers .",
    "furthermore , the approach taken in these articles relies on the assumption that the flow field has no influence on the dynamic contact angle .",
    "this has been shown by experiments to be incorrect , e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the model aimed at describing this effect has to be based on the young equation that actually introduces the contact angle as a macroscopic fluid - mechanical concept and hence its numerical implementation has to rely on incorporating gradients of the surface tension along the contacting interfaces @xcite .",

    "the drawback of this approach is that the midpoint nodes become dependent on the position of the adjacent spines .",
    "this means that the nodal positions become dependent on , at most : the position of the contact line ; the apex position , which is used to define @xmath347 in ( [ transf ] ) ; and on the free surface unknowns of the adjacent spines .",
    "the polar and the bipolar meshes can be used local to the contact line with a different mesh design , or even a different numerical method @xcite , taking over further away . in our case",
    ", we used straight spines for the rest of the capillary as the geometry is simple ; however , it would be possible to use unstructured meshing away from the contact line which would allow a greater degree of flexibility .      having derived the expressions which will be required in the residuals and described a particular mesh design , we proceed to outline the finite element method .",
    "the method is not restricted to the capillary geometry and our only assumption about the free surface is that in the @xmath119-plane , i.e.  the computational domain , it is a line parameterized by arclength @xmath121 with position defined by a function of one variable @xmath302 which depends on the particular mesh design .",
    "in other words , to determine the free surface shape we must determine the value of @xmath122 at every node on the free surface @xmath123 .    the domain is tesselated into @xmath355 non - overlapping subdomains of area @xmath356 , the _ elements _ , which in our case will be two - dimensional curved - sided triangles whose positions are defined by the spines of the mesh and hence by the values of free surface unknowns @xmath122 .",
    "the boundary of the computational domain is composed of one - dimensional elements of arclength @xmath357 formed from the sides of the bulk elements which are adjacent to the boundary .",
    "we refer to element level quantities as _ local _ and those defined over the entire domain , which were used in  [ fem ] , as _",

    "this allows us to derive expressions for the residuals in an arbitrary element which , after summing up contributions from every element in the domain , will form a set of algebraic equations whose coefficients are integrals to be calculated using the methods described in section  [ mapping ] .",

    ", the contact line corresponds to one point .",
    "the vector @xmath97 , which is defined to be normal to the contact line and inwardly tangent to a given surface , will then coincide with the tangent vector @xmath457 of the surface in the @xmath119-plane .",

    "we have arrived at a set of algebraic equations whose coefficients are integrals over the master element which may be easily calculated using numerical integration .",
    "the integrands contain products of interpolating functions , which are low order polynomials , and hence gaussian quadrature is well - suited to the task .",
    "gaussian quadrature allows the integral to be approximated by a weighted sum of the integrand evaluated at a finite number of points , called the gauss points .",
    "using enough points , one can evaluate polynomial expressions of any degree exactly .",
    "the rules for integration over a one - dimensional master element , say @xmath382 $ ] , are easiest and hence presented first . using @xmath459 gauss points one can exactly integrate a polynomial of degree @xmath460 using @xmath461 where @xmath462 are the specially chosen gauss points and @xmath463 are the appropriate weights .",
    "taking @xmath464 with @xmath465 is sufficient for exact integration of all surface integrals .",
    "for integration over the master element s area we have @xmath466 one can use tensor products of the one - dimensional case , i.e.  integrate over one coordinate and then the other , and hence ensure that with @xmath467 gauss points we can exactly integrate a polynomial of degree @xmath468 .",
    "however , these expressions are not optimal : one can usually integrate a polynomial of degree @xmath468 with less than @xmath467 points @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the non - tensor expressions is that the determination of the points and the weights becomes more complex . here",
    ", we simply list the @xmath469 points and weights which will exactly integrate polynomials of order @xmath470 and were found to be sufficient for a range of parameter values .",
    "they are : @xmath471 polynomials of higher order than @xmath470 may exist in the integrands of the bulk integrals , but for a range of parameter values the order of quadrature suggested here has been sufficient .",
    "it is recommended that a user tests different numbers of gauss points to ensure optimal speed without loss of accuracy .",
    "when very small elements are used , roughly for element sizes of @xmath472 , extreme care has to be taken to ensure that the finite precision arithmetic does not create significant errors in the values of the integrals .",
    "in particular , it was found that for the calculation of the determinant of the jacobian @xmath473 in ( [ jacobian2 ] ) , which is of order @xmath474 , and only depends on the relative positions of the nodes in the global domain , the coordinate system should be shifted so that the contact line , near which the smallest elements reside , is at @xmath475 .",
    "at each global node we have a number of algebraic equations whose unknowns are the functions nodal values . these equations and unknowns must each be given a unique position and assembled into a set of ( nonlinear ) algebraic equations to which standard solution methods can be applied .",
    "a solution vector @xmath476 , which contains all of the functions nodal unknowns , can be easily formed by looping through every global node and assigning the functions unknowns there consecutive positions in @xmath476 , i.e.  each unknown in the problem is assigned a unique position in @xmath476 .",
    "then , the residual which determines a given unknown is given the same position in a vector containing all of the residual values @xmath477 .",
    "to solve the assembled set of ( nonlinear ) algebraic equations the newton - raphson method is used .",
    "this method takes an approximate solution @xmath478 with associated residuals @xmath479 and then provides an updated solution @xmath480 for each entry in the solution vector by solving @xmath481=-\\bd{r}(\\bd{\\alpha}^{m } ) , \\qquad j_{{\\textrm{i } } \\textrm{j}}={\\dfrac{\\partial^ { } r_{{\\textrm{i}}}(\\bd{\\alpha}^{m})}{\\partial { \\alpha^m _ { \\textrm{j } } } ^{}}}.\\ ] ] the method has quadratic convergence and may be repeated until a sufficient degree of accuracy is achieved . in our computations ,",
    "the resulting linearized equations were solved using the ma41 solver provided by the harwell subroutine library .",
    "the main complexity of the newton - raphson method is in the formation of the jacobian @xmath482 in ( [ fem_nr ] ) , and this is now described .",
    "it may not be necessary to do this at every iteration : methods which do not reform the entire jacobian after each iteration are known as quasi - newton methods , see @xcite .",
    "entries of the jacobian may be calculated numerically , using a difference formula , or determined analytically .",
    "analytic calculation is computationally significantly faster and also improves the convergence of the code , particularly when using small elements where the combination of truncation and round - off errors in the calculation of the jacobian can become significant if calculated numerically .",
    "analytic calculation is easily achieved for the dependence of the residuals on everything except the free surface unknowns which will be considered later .",
    "entries of the jacobian are built , as the residuals are , element - by - element .",
    "below , as a representative example , the derivative of the nonlinear local term @xmath483 , appearing in the @xmath66-momentum residual ( [ a_aa ] ) , with respect to velocity @xmath484 is determined : @xmath485 as with the residuals , the local nodes @xmath486 will need to be related to the global ones in ( [ fem_nr ] ) using the function @xmath487 .",
    "the only non - analytic calculation in our code is the dependence of the bulk nodal positions on the free surface nodal unknowns , which can become extremely complex when using the bipolar coordinate system described in section  [ spine_design ] .",
    "as the residuals and the jacobian are evaluated in an element - by - element manner , it is most useful to know the dependency of the positions of an element s nodes @xmath488 on the global unknowns @xmath489 .",
    "a quick way of calculating them numerically is by noting the unknowns which the nodal positions depend on , in our case the contact line position , apex height and nodal position at the end of the spine on which they lie and possibly the adjacent ones .",
    "the original nodal positions @xmath490 are updated by changing the free surface unknown @xmath491 , on which the dependency is required , to @xmath492 , where @xmath493 , and obtaining a new mesh with nodal positions @xmath494 . repeating this procedure for each global nodal unknown @xmath495",
    "gives the required numerically calculated dependencies @xmath496 and it is noted that @xmath497 is a local position whilst @xmath491 is a global unknown .    as a representative example , we will show how to calculate the dependence of the pressure terms in the @xmath118-momentum residual ( [ a_c ] ) , @xmath498 , on a global free surface unknown @xmath491 .",
    "a possible issue is that the domain for the integral depends on the position of the nodes themselves ; however , by mapping our integral to the fixed master element this problem is resolved .",
    "the calculation required is @xmath499 where @xmath500 using ( [ tmatrix2 ] ) , gives @xmath501 so that @xmath502{\\dfrac{\\partial^ { } r_{m}}{\\partial { h_{\\textrm{j}}}^ { } } } , \\qquad l , m=1\\hbox{--}6.\\ ] ]    it is clear that the derivation and analysis of these integrals is rather cumbersome and prone to error .",
    "however , one can easily check the correctness of the semi - analytically determined jacobian by comparing it to an approximate one calculated using a forward difference for all entries .",
    "this procedure will allow errors to be quickly found and rectified . in the fem , many equations are only dependent on unknowns in adjacent elements , so that most entries in the jacobian are zero .",
    "then , if the equations and unknowns are ordered in a sensible manner , the matrix is sparse and banded with the exception of the dependence of all nodes on the contact line position and apex height .    in some cases , to ensure convergence of the solution , the code was started with the solid moving slowly , i.e.  @xmath503 .",
    "then , using the previous solution as an initial guess , the procedure was repeated , with a higher speed , until @xmath504 .",
    "this was the case at higher capillary numbers where the final free surface shape differs considerably from the initial guess of the static shape .      from the local asymptotics in ",
    "[ comp_loc ] it can be seen that both the pressure and normal stress on the solid are logarithmically singular as the contact line is approached , and so , strictly speaking , special singular elements @xcite should be used to capture this behaviour near the contact line .",
    "such an approach has previously been considered for this class of flows in @xcite .",
    "the singular elements have been incorporated into our code , see @xcite ; however , to simplify our exposition we have opted against using them here and , as can be seen from figure  [ f : u_asymp ] , the agreement of the ( integrably singular ) asymptotic result for @xmath145 with the computed one is still excellent right up to the node adjacent to the contact line .",
