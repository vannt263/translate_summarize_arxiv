    "the computation of gravitational wave production from the interaction and merger of compact astrophysical objects is an analytical and computational challenge .",
    "these calculations would be able to provide both a predictive and an analytical resource for the gravitational - wave interferometric detectors such as ligo @xcite , virgo and geo600 @xcite soon to be online .",
    "we concentrate on the case of binary black hole mergers @xcite .    besides ours",
    ", the other major efforts to numerically simulate black hole coalescences are being carried out by the aei - washu - ncsa @xcite and the cornell - illinois collaborations @xcite .",
    "the resolutions currently under consideration by the aei - washu - ncsa effort are as fine as @xmath7 in a computational domain of with @xmath8 mesh - points , where @xmath9 denotes the grid spacing .",
    "our computations are carried out at a similarly modest resolution @xmath10 , on @xmath11 domains .",
    "the goal of all these groups is to perform eventually simulations in domains of up to @xmath12 grid - points , which will allow finer resolution and/or large physical domain sizes .",
    "regardless of resolution , in order to carry out such simulations , we must construct initial data sets representing binary black hole systems .",
    "these data sets should not only satisfy the einstein constraints but also carry the desired physical content .",
    "binary black hole initial data sets are the subject of this paper .    under the @xmath13 formulation of general relativity",
    ", the construction of initial data requires solving the hamiltonian and momentum constraints : @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . above",
    ", @xmath16 is the 3-dimensional ricci scalar constructed from the spatial 3-metric @xmath17 , and k_ij = a_ij + g_ij k is the extrinsic curvature tensor . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the trace and trace - free parts of @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "covariant differentiation with respect to @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "spacetime indices will be denoted by greek letters and spatial indices by latin letters .",
    "the systematic solution of the constraint equations is due to lichnerowicz , choquet - bruhat , york and others @xcite .",
    "this procedure involves freely specifying a metric @xmath22 , a traceless extrinsic curvature @xmath23 and the trace @xmath24 .",
    "it then introduces a conformal factor @xmath25 , and a scaling rule to determine the physical @xmath17 and @xmath20 : @xmath26 as functions of the coordinates ( defined both in the physical and in the trial conformal space ) .",
    "solution consists of simultaneously determining @xmath25 ( eq .",
    "( [ hc ] ) becomes an elliptic equation for @xmath25 ) and correcting the longitudinal part of @xmath19 .",
    "typically , one introduces a vector potential @xmath27 to accomplish this latter task and the problem consists of four coupled elliptic equations for @xmath25 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "our work is based on descriptions of black holes in ingoing eddington - finkelstein ( ief ) coordinates .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that , in these coordinates , surfaces of constant time `` penetrate '' the event horizon .",
    "foliations that penetrate the horizon facilitate the excision of the singularity from the computational domain .",
    "the essence of black hole excision is the removal of the singularity while preserving the integrity of the spacetime accessible to observers outside the black hole .",
    "as originally suggested by unruh @xcite , this is only possible if the excised region is fully contained within the event horizon , thus the need to have access to the interior of the black holes .",
    "other work , such as that of brgmann @xcite for the generic 3-dimensional code , does not use excision , and instead solves @xmath28 initial data in a conformally flat background @xcite . here , we keep @xmath18 non - zero to maintain close similarities to the analytically known single kerr - schild black hole .    the 4-dimensional form of the kerr - schild spacetime @xcite :    @xmath29    describes isolated single black holes . here",
    "the scalar function @xmath30 has a known form , and @xmath31 is an ingoing null vector congruence associated with the solution .",

    "i.e. _ an inward pointing null vector with unit spatial part . from the fact that eq .",
    "( [ interval ] ) is an exact solution to the einstein equations , one can write the 3-metric , and the momenta @xmath20 associated with eq .",
    "( [ interval ] ) .",
    "initial data setting for multiple black hole spacetimes using the method described by matzner , huq , and shoemaker ( mhs ) @xcite begins by specifying a conformal spatial metric which is a straightforward superposition of two kerr - schild single hole ( spatial ) metrics :    @xmath34    the fields marked with the pre - index @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) correspond to an isolated black hole with specific angular momentum @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and boosted with velocity @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the superposition of the conformal momenta is defined as follows : the extrinsic curvature for a single hole ( say hole 1 ) @xmath41 is converted to a mixed - index object , @xmath42 the trace of @xmath24 is calculated as the sum of the corresponding traces : @xmath43 and the transverse - traceless part of the extrinsic curvature @xmath44 as @xmath45    mhs propose the use the metric and extrinsic curvature so defined as a _",
    "metric and extrinsic curvature to solve the coupled elliptic system @xcite .",
    "here we take a different approach . after all , when two black holes are widely separated we expect almost - linear superposition to hold , so the data setting as specified above , _ without _ the elliptic solution for @xmath25 and @xmath27 , should lead to only small errors in the widely separated case .",
    "we show here that even for interestingly close separation scenarios , the superposition errors are small , and in fact both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 norms are smaller than those of the truncation error ( the discretization error in the calculation ) in simulations at currently accessible computational resolutions . in all cases here",
    "we present the results for head - on collisions ( which are simpler to display ) but very similar results are found at similar separations for non head - on data .",
    "figure [ hc_view ] shows plots of the norms of the residuals of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints for a head - on collision using initial data @xmath46 provided by eq .",
    "( [ gapprox ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ aapprox ] ) , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the data are @xmath47 , @xmath48 along the @xmath49 axis , and the holes are boosted against each other in the @xmath50 direction with velocity @xmath51 .",
    "the residuals are defined as the absolute value of @xmath52 where again ",
    "@xmath53 \" denotes analytic quantities evaluated using the approximate solutions ( [ gapprox ] ) and ( [ aapprox ] ) .",
    "we see from figure [ hc_view ] that the violation of the constraints is primarily confined to a region near each hole .",
    "this is due to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ hres ] ) is the sum of terms which scale as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the coordinate distance to the singularity and @xmath56 is the coordinate separation between holes . for an isolated black hole ,",
    "these terms cancel each other out exactly , since the kerr - schild metric is an exact solution of the constraint equations . however , that is not the case for the spacetime metric and extrinsic curvatures provided by eqs .",
    "( [ gapprox ] ) and ( [ aapprox ] ) .",
    "the presence of the perturbation of the second hole in the vicinity of the first hole destroys the balance between these terms , causing the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hres ] ) to scale as @xmath54 . as in our computational approach",
    "to evolving the spacetime , we mask the interior of the black hole . in this example",
    ", we excise the points inside a sphere of radius @xmath57 centered at the hole , where the absolute value of the specific angular momentum @xmath58 is also the radius of the kerr ring - like singularity and @xmath9 is the grid spacing ( for figure [ hc_view ] , @xmath5 ) . hence , figure [ hc_view ] plots precisely the error _ on the computational domain_.    every finite difference code will have a corresponding truncation error associated with discretization . in most of the finite difference codes under development ,",
    "this error scales as @xmath59 , second order accuracy ; therefore , given a second order finite difference discretization of the constraints , the truncation errors are obtained from @xmath60 above , ",
    "@xmath61 \" is used to denote finite difference discretization , and it is understood that these finite difference expressions are to be evaluated using the exact , not approximate , solutions of the constraints . of course , these exact solutions are not yet available @xcite . in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", we obtain an estimate of the truncation errors from the absolute value of @xmath62 instead .",
    "although these truncation errors correspond to a modified form of the constraints , these errors should not be substantially different since the structure of the terms involving finite difference operators was not changed , only analytic functions ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) have been added .",
    "notice that for an isolated hole , the kerr - schild spatial metric and extrinsic curvature satisfy exactly the constraint equations ( @xmath65 ) , leaving us with an error exclusively related to the truncation error .",
    "figure [ hc_zoom_sup ] shows the residual @xmath63 ( diamonds ) and truncation error @xmath66 ( circles ) in the hamiltonian constraint in a region around the rightmost hole of figure [ hc_view ] . the truncation error @xmath66",
    "was obtained in a mesh with grid spacing @xmath5 .    in order to compare the global degree of satisfaction of the initial value equations by the methods described here , we calculate the @xmath1 ( maximum ) and @xmath0 ( average of the absolute value ) norms of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints",
    "we do this over the axis joining the black holes from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , excluding the points inside two segments of length @xmath69 , centered around each hole , as indicated above .",
    "as shown in table i , lines 1 and 4 , both the @xmath0 and the @xmath70 norms of the superposition error are less than those of the @xmath71 truncation error",
    ". however figure [ hc_zoom_sup ] makes it clear that the truncation error is not uniformly ( pointwise ) larger than the superposition error .",
    "we find in practice that at @xmath71 , superposition yields adequate behavior in the evolution .",
    "figure [ mc_zoom_sup ] shows a similar diagram to figure [ hc_zoom_sup ] for the momentum constraint . in this case",
    "the superposition method can be used to provide data with error pointwise uniformly smaller than the truncation error .",
    "in order to reduce the residual errors , we propose a variation of the superposition method that preserves the simplicity of being analytical . essentially , the method consists of multiplying  attenuation \" functions into the recipe of the previous section .",
    "the new approximate metric @xmath72 , trace @xmath18 and tensor @xmath73 take the form :    @xmath74    the purpose of the attenuation function @xmath75 is to minimize the effects due to a given hole on the neighborhood of the other hole .",
    "for instance , the attenuation function @xmath76 is unity everywhere except in the vicinity of hole-2 where it rapidly vanishes so the metric and extrinsic curvature there are effectively that of a single black hole .",
    "the attenuation functions with this property can be constructed in a number of different ways .",
    "an example of an attenuation function is _",
    "1b= 1-e^-r^4/^4  , [ fd_att ] where r^2 & = & ( ^2 - a^2 ) +  , + & = &  . here",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath58 and @xmath78 denote the coordinate location , specific angular momentum and boost factor of hole-2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath79 represents a free parameter of the attenuation function .",
    "an expression similar to ( [ fd_att ] ) for @xmath80 is obtained by reversing the labels .",
    "the attenuation function ( [ fd_att ] ) was chosen amongst a few different types for its simplicity and better performance .",
    "since the constraints involve second order derivatives , it is important to pick attenuation functions that vanish up to second order derivatives , as in ( [ fd_att ] ) , so  pure \" single black hole solutions can be obtained in the neighborhood of each hole .",
    "figures [ hc_zoom_sup ] and [ hc_zoom_att ] ( [ mc_zoom_sup ] and [ mc_zoom_att ] ) show the hamiltonian ( momentum ) constraint for a region around the rightmost hole of figure [ hc_view ] .",
    "figure [ hc_zoom_sup ] shows a comparison between the truncation error for @xmath5 ( empty circles ) and the superposition initial data ( full diamonds ) , while figure [ hc_zoom_att ] shows the same for attenuated initial data ( full squares ) .",
    "first we note in figure [ hc_zoom_att ] that in some areas ( near @xmath81 , for instance ) the violation of the constraints for these attenuated data is greater than that corresponding to truncation error .",
    "however , even in these areas the violation is smooth and small in absolute value , as opposed to the unbounded behavior shown by the superposition data near the singularity , and the divergent behavior present at the singularity has disappeared with the use of attenuated data .",
    "this is due to the fact that , having cancelled the influence of the presence of the second hole , the fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 become the fields corresponding to an isolated black hole at the location of the singularity .",
    "the results are presented in table [ table_norms ] .",
    "the momentum constraint @xmath0 norm represents the average of the three components of eq .",
    "( [ mct ] ) and the @xmath1 the maximum value of them .",
    "these values are compared to the norms of the truncation error in the constraints caused by the finite difference stencils for grid spacings @xmath5 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "these results show that with these norms , the superposition initial data violate the hamiltonian and momentum constraints below the truncation error corresponding to grid spacings as fine as @xmath5 , while the attenuated data extend this range to at least @xmath6 .",
    "note also that , for both the superposition and the attenuated method , the momentum constraint equations are satisfied well within the truncation error for grid spacings as fine as @xmath86 .",
    "finally table [ table_norms ] ( rows 2 , 3 ) shows the approximate second order convergence between resolutions @xmath6 and @xmath86 .",
    "the convergence rate is _ approximately _ second order because even at @xmath86 , finite @xmath9 effects affect significantly the convergence .",
    "the initial value problem for black hole binary systems is currently approached by solving numerically a set of elliptic equations derived from the hamiltonian and momentum constraint . due to the presence of singularities in the fields , these equations are complex and difficult to handle .    in this article we presented analytical methods that can provide initial value data for black hole binary systems . while these solutions are only approximate",
    ", they satisfy the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations to the level of accuracy ( evaluated with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 norms ) of the truncation error present in finite difference codes for a given range of grid resolutions . because attenuated data are so much smoother than the superposition , and because the principal difficulties in computational simulations arise from sharp gradients and divergent values , which the attenuation method eliminates , we are confident that at least for the particular example of a head - on collision of two equal - mass black holes at a separation of @xmath4 , thess data could be used in evolutionary codes with grid spacings as fine as @xmath6 .",
    "the analytical nature of these methods makes them simpler to implement than the numerical approach .",
    "furthermore , a more comprehensive study of the attenuation functions may extended the range of resolutions for which this approximation is valid .",
    "the attenuation method offers the advantage that it cancels the divergent behavior of the constraints near the central singularity",
    ". the suppression of contributions near the black holes ( individual holes have exactly zero residuals ) should simplify the exact problem , since this method provides exact inner boundary conditions for the elliptic solver .",
