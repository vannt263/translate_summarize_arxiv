    "<S> light - scattering in the terahertz region is demonstrated for granular matter . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to single scattering also collective correlations can be identified and extracted as a static structure factor .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical physics of granular matter has seen rapid progress in recent years : in addition to macroscopic measurements , experiments with direct imaging in two dimensions @xcite or tomography in three dimensions @xcite allow for analyses on the scale of individual particles . </S>",
    "<S> many computer - simulation studies provide testable predictions for particle packings or reveal intriguing structural anomalies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below the length scales of typical granular particles lies the realm of colloidal suspensions where light scattering has emerged as a reliable technique for the investigation of such structural properties and phase transitions @xcite . scattering offers the principle advantages of ( a ) being able to monitor the time evolution of the measured system , ( b ) good resolution of both larger and smaller length scales with reliable statistics , and ( c ) the in - situ measurement of three - dimensional samples . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the use of scattering techniques is desirable also for granular matter </S>",
    "<S> .    with practical laser sources now emerging in the terhertz region , light scattering with wavelengths between 30  @xmath0 m and 1  mm becomes possible @xcite . as these wavelengths match typical particle sizes in granular media @xcite , but also sizes of cells and unicellular organisms @xcite , suitable setups as well as methods for interpretation shall unlock the potential for terahertz light scattering in these areas . </S>",
    "<S> in the following , we present a bench - top light - scattering configuration using terahertz radiation , and demonstrate it for the investigation of granular particles between 80  @xmath0 m and 1  mm in diameter . by suitable interpretation of the scattering intensities </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the particle sizes and for high densities identify the correlations among the particle positions in a static structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate the possibility to investigate structures on previously unattainable length scales by scattering techniques in the terhertz region .    </S>",
    "<S> thz extinction spectra obtained from samples comprising granular media have already indicated sensitivity of the extinction to particle size and packing density @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , such measurements are superpositions of spectroscopic features of the sampled materials as well as scattering effects , and therefore difficult to interpret . </S>",

    "<S> common solvents like water , organic liquids and air are transparent , and background light is easily shielded by lightproof containers . </S>",
    "<S> using thz radiation imposes several constraints not present in experiments with visible light : many media including ambient air are highly absorbing over large regions of the thz spectrum , and strong background radiation from thermal emission at room temperature has to be faced @xcite . to overcome these constraints we use ( 1 ) a transmission window of air at 3.4  thz , ( 2 ) thin , effectively two - dimensional samples and ( 3 ) lock - in detection of the signal </S>",
