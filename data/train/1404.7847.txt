    "thermoelectric ( te ) materials , which can convert heat directly to electricity , are of considerable interest for applications such as waste heat recovery due to their silent operation , reliability and lack of working fluid.@xcite the performance of te devices is characterized by the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath2 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath3 is the absolute temperature at which the properties are measured and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding thermal conductivities for electrons and phonons.@xcite to achieve comparable efficiency to that of mechanical cycles , @xmath6 should be greater than 2 , but commonly used bulk te materials such as @xmath7 typically have @xmath8 .",
    "recently , nanocrystalline materials , which are polycrystalline materials with nanoscale grain sizes , have been demonstrated as efficient thermoelectric by significantly reducing the phonon thermal conductivity by strong phonon grain boundary scattering.@xcite many of these materials show great promise for scalable manufacturing . in particular , the nanostructuring approach has been successful for silicon and silicon - germanium alloys created by ball - milling and hot pressing .",
    "sige has long been used for space power generation@xcite and the thermoelectric properties of sige nanocomposites with improved properties over those of the bulk were recently reported.@xcite substantial improvements in nanostructured bulk si , which does not require expensive and rare ge , were also reported.@xcite while these gains are significant , further improvements are difficult to achieve due to the lack of understanding of grain boundary scattering , which plays a critical role in scattering phonons in nanocrystalline materials .    phonon transport in nanostructured si / sige has been recently studied using molecular dynamics@xcite , atomistic green s functions@xcite and phonon - boltzmann - equation - based simulations .",
    "@xcite many studies assumed that the transmissivity of phonons across the boundary to be constant in a gray model .",
    "however , atomistic calculations@xcite reported that transmissivity depends on phonon frequency .",
    "kimmer _ _ et al.__@xcite found that transmission through the high - energy grain boundary in silicon is a function of the phonon frequency using molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "li and yang@xcite used atomistic green s functions to study the effect of lattice mismatch on phonon transmission across interfaces and showed that transmissivity decreases as phonon frequency increases . these predictions are supported by a recent experimental work by wang _ _ et al__@xcite , who reported temperature ( @xmath3 ) dependent measurement of thermal conductivities of nanocrystalline silicon .",
    "while a @xmath9 dependence of thermal conductivity is expected based on the gray model , they instead observed a @xmath10 dependence , implying that transmissivity increases with decreasing phonon frequency .",
    "this result suggests that lower frequency modes are less scattered by interfaces compared to higher frequency modes .",
    "a frequency - dependent transmissivity would have an important effect on the distribution of heat among the phonon spectrum and hence on strategies to further reduce the thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline si and sige .",
    "however , phonon transport in nanocrystalline thermoelectrics with frequency dependent grain boundary scattering has not yet been systematically explored .",
    "here we examine the effects of frequency - dependent grain boundary scattering on the thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline si and sige alloys using efficient variance - reduced monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "this novel computational method enables the simulation of phonon transport in the full 3d geometry of the crystal with orders of magnitude reduced computational cost compared to previous numerical methods while rigorously including the frequency - dependence of phonon properties .",
    "moreover , the simulations allow us to examine in detail how the frequency - dependent grain boundary scattering modifies the distribution of heat among the thermal phonon spectrum , providing an important guide to further improving the thermoelectric efficiency of nanocrystalline si and sige .",
    "we seek to simulate thermal phonon transport in a polycrystalline domain with grain sizes of tens to hundreds of nanometers . to study heat transfer in this mesoscopic structure ,",
    "we need to solve the frequency - dependent boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) under the relaxation time approximation .",
    "the energy - based bte is given by:@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the desired deviational distribution function , @xmath13^{-1}$ ] is a bose - einstein distribution at the control temperature @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the phonon group velocity and @xmath16 is the phonon relaxation time . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath18 is the bolzmann constant , @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath19 is the phonon frequency and p is the phonon polarization .",
    "the bte is very difficult to solve numerically even in simple geometries due to the high dimensionality of the distribution function .",
    "various numerical techniques have been developed to solve the bte , including discrete ordinates@xcite , a finite volume approach@xcite , monte carlo simulations@xcite and a mean free path ( mfp ) sampling algorithm.@xcite however , these methods are either computationally expensive or make simplifying assumptions that may not be accurate .",
    "another approach to incorporate boundary scattering is to model the interface scattering using a phenomenological volumetric scattering rate @xmath20.@xcite while this approach has minimal computational requirements and provides useful insights , it lacks predictive power because the value of the geometrical length @xmath21 depends on frequency in the non - gray model and is not known in advance .    in this work , we overcome these computational challenges using a novel variance - reduced , frequency - dependent monte carlo technique recently introduced by peraud and hadjiconstantinou .",
    "@xcite specifically , we solve the adjoint bte using a linearized , energy - based deviational mc algorithm .",
    "this algorithm enables us to solve the frequency - dependent bte in a large , complex geometry with minimal memory requirements and substantially reduced computational cost compared to traditional mc algorithms .",
    "the algorithm we have chosen incorporates several key improvements over other numerical methods that we describe in turn .",
    "first , we use a deviational mc algorithm based on eq .",
    "( [ bte_energy ] ) rather than traditional mc method.@xcite deviational mc techniques achieve variance - reduction by recognizing that many of the collisions performed in traditional mc simulations serve only to stochastically compute the bose - einstein equilibrium distribution that is already known analytically .",
    "the variance of the calculation can be dramatically reduced by replacing the stochastic calculation of this known distribution with an analytical expression .",
    "second , for problems exhibiting sufficiently small temperature differences , the collision operator in eq .",
    "( [ bte_energy ] ) can be linearized . as a result",
    ", properties for scattered particles can be drawn from a distribution that is independent of the local temperature , allowing each particle to be simulated independently and thereby eliminating the need for discretization in space and time.@xcite in addition to further reducing computational cost , this method dramatically reduces the memory requirements of mc simulations because all the phonon properties do not need to be stored simultaneously .",
    "finally , we solve the adjoint bte rather than the traditional bte using a recent approach introduced by peraud _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite one drawback of solving the traditional bte is that the frequencies of the phonon are drawn from a distribution weighted by the density of states of each phonon mode . as a result ,",
    "even if modes with small density of states contribute substantially to heat conduction , as occurs in silicon , these phonons are unlikely to be sampled , leading to large noise at certain frequencies .",
    "et al . _ recently showed that this limitation can be overcome using an adjoint approach , in which phonons are emitted uniformly over the frequency spectrum and subsequently weighted by the correct distribution to provide a variance - reduced estimate of the heat flux .",
    "the full details of the computation are discussed by peraud _",
    "et al . _ and will only be briefly reviewed here .",
    "the computational domain is a 3d cube with square grains as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : validation](b ) .",
    "the domain bisects the grain in each dimension , placing the corner of the grains in the center of the domain .",
    "we impose a periodic heat flux boundary conditions along the direction of temperature gradient to model an infinitely repeating structure.@xcite the other two directions have a specular boundary condition imposed by symmetry .",
    "these boundary conditions allow the thermal properties of an infinite polycrystal to be calculated using only one period .",
    "we impose a linearly varying equilibrium temperature @xmath22 that allows the control temperature to follow the physical temperature more closely.@xcite this variation in @xmath14 can be implemented as a uniform volumetric source of deviational phonon bundles , each representing a fixed amount of deviational energy .",
    "the frequencies of the phonon bundles are drawn from a uniform distribution according to the adjoint bte .",
    "the algorithm then proceeds by stochastically simulating the advection , scattering and sampling of phonon bundles sequentially and completely independently exactly as described by peraud _",
    "et al_.@xcite finally , the calculated spectral heat flux is weighted by the appropriate distribution to obtain the final heat flux.@xcite    in this work , we consider si and @xmath23 with ge modeled as a mass defect scattering mechanism in silicon .",
    "we model silicon using the dispersion along the [ 100 ] direction and assume that the crystal is isotropic.@xcite optical phonons are neglected due to their small contributions to heat transfer in silicon.@xcite the acoustic phonon relaxation times are given by@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant that equals @xmath26 for bulk silicon@xcite .",
    "for electron - phonon scattering , the relaxation time is given as@xcite @xmath27}{1+\\exp\\left[\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}m^*v_s^2-e_f}{k_bt}+\\frac{\\hbar^2\\omega^2}{8m^*v^2_sk_bt}-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_bt}\\right]}\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent acoustic deformation potential , density of states effective mass , density , averaged phonon group velocity and fermi level , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 are obtained from the literature , which are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 corresponding to a doping concentration of approximately @xmath37 in n - type si .    for mass defect scattering in sige",
    ", we take a to be @xmath38 , which corresponds to x = 0.25 in @xmath39 according to the formula given by klemens.@xcite we then adjust the deformation potential @xmath28 until the thermal conductivity matches experimentally reported values of bulk sige,@xcite yielding @xmath40 , in reasonable agreement with the value reported by holland.@xcite for doped si , we change a to be @xmath41 , which corresponds to a doping concentration of @xmath37.@xcite in the next section , we show that the results of this work are not sensitive to the exact values of these fitting parameters .    the critical parameter in our model is the phonon transmissivity across the grain boundaries",
    ". many previous works assumed a gray model , but this model is not consistent with the measurements of wang _ et al .",
    "_ we use a frequency - dependent transmissivity @xmath42 proposed by wang _",
    "_ in the form of@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a fitting parameter and @xmath45 is the maximum phonon frequency .",
    "this model is qualitatively consistent with atomistic green s function calculations.@xcite note that this condition implies that the transmissivity approaches one as frequency goes to zero , which is physically consistent with the expectation that long wavelength phonons are unaffected by atomistic disorder at a grain boundary .",
    "we implement the condition with the following procedure .",
    "if a particle encounters the interface , its transmissivity is calculated using the phonon s frequency .",
    "if a random number is less than the calculated transmissivity , then the phonon transmits through the interface ; otherwise , the phonon is reflected .",
    "following wang _",
    ", we use ziman s specularity parameter to determine whether the scattering is specular or diffuse : @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the phonon wavelength and @xmath48 is the rms surface roughness .",
    "if a randomly drawn number is less than @xmath49 , the phonon experiences specular scattering , in which case the phonon s velocity vector is known from momentum conservation .",
    "otherwise , the phonon is scattered diffusely . in the latter case ,",
    "the phonon s new velocity vector is randomized according to the half - sphere defined by the normal vector of the interface .",
    "we validated our code by computing the spectral thermal conductivity versus phonon frequency of the bulk silicon at room temperature .",
    "the analytical expression for the spectral thermal conductivity is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mode specific heat and @xmath52 is the phonon mfp .",
    "the plot gives a quantitative measure how each phonon contributes to the total thermal conductivity .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : validation](a ) , excellent agreement between the computation and the analytical solution is observed .",
    "also note that the stochastic noise is low everywhere over the entire phonon spectrum in the adjoint method , while the noise increases as the phonon frequency decreases with the original algorithm due to undersampling of low frequency phonons .    with this validation ,",
    "we proceed to the nanocrystalline material by determining the fitting parameter @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transmissivity ] ) .",
    "the reported material had 550 nm grains and was nominally undoped . by fitting the experimental thermal conductivity with our model ,",
    "we obtain @xmath53 and the surface roughness @xmath54 nm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : specularity ] ) explain the thermal conductivity data from wang _ et al .",
    "_ since the reported si is nominally undoped , we take @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_md ] ) to be the value of bulk silicon . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : validation](b ) , the simulated thermal conductivities of nanocrystalline silicon obtained using the proposed transmissivity model is in good agreement with the experiment over the temperature range . note that based on the fitted @xmath44 , the transmissivity varies from 1 to 0.85 as frequency increases , which is much higher than the typical nominal value of the transmissivity used in the literature .",
    "with the fitting parameters determined , we first examine the difference between the gray and non - gray model for the same undoped nano - si material .",
    "we focus on examining the distribution of heat in the thermal phonon spectrum by plotting the spectral thermal conductivity as a function of phonon frequency .",
    "we choose the frequency - independent transmissivity in the gray model to be 0.9 such that the total thermal conductivities given by the gray and non - gray models are approximately the same . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanosi](a ) , the gray model predicts a substantial decrease in heat at the low frequency regime while the non - gray model predicts a much higher contribution to the total heat from those low frequency phonons .",
    "this increase is expected because the transmissivity approaches one in the low frequency limit , indicating that low frequency phonons are scattered less by grain boundaries compared to the prediction of the gray model .",
    "we next seek to understand doped nanocrystalline si / sige thermoelectric materials by using the fitted constants described in the previous section to account for the mass defect and electron - phonon scattering mechanisms .",
    "we take grain size to be 20 nm following the experimental reports.@xcite the result of these effects on the heat transport in nanocrystalline silicon and sige is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanosi](b ) .",
    "we find that high frequency phonons are strongly scattered by the impurities while low frequency phonons are scattered by the electrons , as expected .",
    "however , due to the non - gray transmissivity , a large fraction of heat is carried by phonons with frequency less than 4 thz .",
    "this observation is unexpected because under the gray model , thermal conductivity reduction is largely due to the scattering of these low frequency phonons , but contribution of these modes remains significant in the non - gray model .",
    "to determine the key length scales for heat conduction , we calculate the phonon mfps .",
    "we plot this quantity as the mfp accumulation function , which has been shown to be a useful quantity for understanding thermal transport.@xcite we calculate the accumulation function by determining an effective mfp for each mode that incorporates all the scattering mechanisms , including grain boundary scattering , using the spectral thermal conductivity for each phonon frequency and polarization and the kinetic equation : @xmath55 .",
    "the spectral thermal conductivity can then be sorted by mfp , from which the mfp accumulation is obtained from the cumulative sum of the spectral thermal conductivity .",
    "our simulations show a surprising result . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanosi](c ) , at room temperature , about 60 % of the total heat in undoped nanocrystalline silicon with a grain size around 20 nm is carried by the phonons with mean free paths longer than the grain size .",
    "even in doped nanocrystalline si and sige , for which low frequency phonons are scattered by electrons , as much as 35 % of the total heat is carried by these long mfp phonons .    to verify that our conclusion does not depend on the fitting parameters for mass - defect and electron - phonon scattering , we examine the change in the mfp distribution as @xmath56 and @xmath57 varied by 50% to 200% of their nominal values for nanocrystalline sige at room temperature .",
    "we find that there is only 3% variation in heat contribution from long mfp phonons due to the change in mass defect scattering magnitude .",
    "similarly , 7 % variation is observation when varying @xmath57 using the same method .",
    "thus , our observation of the importance of long mfp phonons is not sensitive to the assumptions made for these scattering mechanisms .",
    "the effects of temperature on the mfp accumulations for doped nanocrystalline si / sige are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempdep ] .",
    "as the temperature increases , the contribution from long mfp phonons decreases due to the dominance of phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "for doped nano - si",
    "[ fig : tempdep](b ) & dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempdep](c ) ) , at room temperature , about 35 % of the total heat is due to phonons with mfps longer than the grain size while at 1000 k , corresponding to the typical operating temperature of devices that use si / sige , the percentage contribution decreases to 20 % . on the other hand , this dominance shift is less obvious in nanocrystalline sige since most of the high frequency phonons , which are more likely to undergo phonon - phonon scattering , are already strongly scattered by the alloy atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempdep](a ) . at 1000 k ,",
    "the contribution from these long mfp phonons in nano sige is still as high as 30 % as shown by solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempdep](c ) .",
    "we now examine the effects of grain size on the heat transport in doped nanocrystalline si / sige .",
    "figures  [ fig : graindep](a ) and ( b ) show the mfp accumulation versus phonon mfp for doped nanocrystalline si / sige with different grain sizes at 300 k. since the mass defect scattering strength is different in the two materials , short mfp phonons are less scattered by the mass defects and in general carry more heat in doped nanocrystalline si than in doped nanocrystalline sige .",
    "regardless of the strength of the mass defect scattering , we find an increase in contribution from long mfp phonons as the grain size decreases in both materials even though smaller grain sizes result in shorter mfp phonons .    to clearly demonstrate this trend , we plot both thermal conductivity and long mfp contribution versus grain size in figs .  [ fig : graindep](c ) & ( d ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that decreasing the grain size can effectively reduce the thermal conductivity.@xcite the decreasing trend of thermal conductivity as grain size decreases in fig .",
    "[ fig : graindep](c ) confirm this observation . as the grain size varies from 550 nm to 20 nm",
    ", there is a 30 % reduction of thermal conductivity for nanocrystalline sige and 45 % in doped nanocrystalline si . due to the stronger mass defect scattering ,",
    "the thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline sige is more than 50 % lower than that of doped nanocrystalline si at a given grain size .",
    "when we look into the contribution to the total thermal conductivity from each phonon mode , we find that , counterintuitively , the contribution from those phonons with mfps longer than the grain size increases as the grain size decreases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graindep](d ) . for a 20 nm grain ,",
    "the contribution from long mfp phonons is as high as 35 % in both nanocrystalline si and sige .",
    "this result can be explained by the increasing fraction of phonons with mfp that is longer than grain size as the grain size decreases . according to the frequency - dependent transmissivity ,",
    "those phonons are less affected by the grain boundaries compared to the prediction of the gray model .",
    "therefore , their contribution to the total thermal conductivity increases even though the total thermal conductivity decreases .",
    "these observations indicate that nanocrystalline grain boundaries may not be as effective as previously believed at scattering long mfp phonons .",
    "if a grain boundary can be designed such that it diffusely scatters all phonons independent of frequency as in the gray model , an additional reduction in the phonon thermal conductivity can be achieved . in figs .",
    "[ fig : graindep](c ) & ( d ) , we plot the thermal conductivity and long mfp phonon contribution versus grain size for the gray model with a constant transmissivity of 0.85 , corresponding to the smallest value of the transmissivity in the non - gray model .",
    "figure  [ fig : graindep](c ) shows that thermal conductivity is approximately 12 % lower than non - gray model in doped nanocrystalline silicon and 30 % lower in doped nanocrystalline sige .",
    "the higher reduction in sige is because long mfp phonons in doped nanocrystalline sige , which are strongly scattered by the grain boundary , contribute more to thermal conductivity than in doped nanocrystalline si .",
    "figure  [ fig : graindep](d ) quantifies this reduction in contribution from long mfp phonons .",
    "the gray grain boundary scatters most of the long mfp phonons such that their contribution to the total thermal conductivity is negligible . in both doped nanocrystalline si and sige with 20 nm grains ,",
    "the long mfp contribution is reduced to less than 5 % .",
    "further thermal conductivity reduction can be achieved if the transmissivity is further decreased",
    ". therefore , great potential to further increase the thermoelectric performance of nanocrystalline si / sige exists if such grain boundaries can be designed .",
    "nanocrystalline si and sige have great potential as thermoelectrics , but a better understanding of grain boundary scattering is necessary to improve their efficiency . in this work ,",
    "we have studied thermal phonon transport in the full 3d geometry of nanocrystalline si and sige using a novel adjoint variance - reduced energy - based monte carlo method .",
    "we find that low frequency , long mfp phonons , which are previously predicted to carry negligible heat in the gray model , may still carry a substantial amount of heat due to the frequency - dependent grain boundary scattering .",
    "significant potential to improve the efficiency of nanocrystalline si and sige exists if these phonons can be scattered .",
