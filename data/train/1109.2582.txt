    "_ from oxford university reported their design of a frequency scanned interferometer ( fsi ) for precise alignment of the atlas inner detector @xcite .",
    "given the demonstrated need for improvements in detector performance , we plan to design and prototype an enhanced fsi system to be used for the alignment of tracker elements in the next generation of electron - positron linear collider detectors .",
    "current plans for future detectors require a spatial resolution for signals from a tracker detector , such as a silicon microstrip or silicon drift detector , to be approximately 7 - 10 @xmath0@xcite . to achieve this required spatial resolution",
    ", the measurement precision of absolute distance changes of tracker elements in one dimension should be on the order of 1 @xmath0 .",
    "simultaneous measurements from hundreds of interferometers will be used to determine the 3-dimensional positions of the tracker elements .    in this paper , we describe ongoing r&d in frequency scanned interferometry ( fsi ) to be applied to alignment monitoring of a detector s charged particle tracking system , in addition to its beam pipe and final - focus quadrupole magnets .",
    "the university of michigan group has constructed several demonstration fsis with the laser light transported by air or single - mode optical fiber , using single - fiber and dual - laser scanning techniques , and dual - laser with dual - channel for initial feasibility studies .",
    "absolute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency .",
    "the main goal of the demonstration systems was to determine the potential accuracy of absolute distance measurements that could be achieved under both controlled and realistic conditions .",
    "secondary goals included estimating the effects of vibrations and studying error sources crucial to the absolute distance accuracy .",
    "two multiple - distance - measurement analysis techniques were developed to improve distance precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations . under laboratory conditions , a measurement precision of @xmath1 50 nm",
    "was achieved for absolute distances ranging from 0.1 meters to 0.7 meters by using the first multiple - distance - measurement technique .",
    "the second analysis technique has the capability to measure vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 hz to 100 hz with amplitude as small as a few nanometers , without a _ priori _ knowledge@xcite .",
    "the multiple - distance - measurement analysis techniques are well suited for reducing vibration effects and uncertainties from fringe & frequency determination , but do not handle well the drift errors , such as from thermal effects .",
    "we describe a dual - laser system intended to reduce the drift errors and show some results under realistic conditions .",
    "the dual - channel fsi is used to make sanity checks of the displacement of the detector simultaneously .",
    "dual lasers with oppositely scanned frequency directions permit cancellation of many systematic errors , making the alignment robust against vibrations and environmental disturbances .",
    "we also report on progress using a dual - channel dual - laser fsi with prototype .",
    "under realistic environmental conditions , a precision of about 0.2 - 0.3 microns was achieved for a distance of about 57 cm for the prototype .",
    "the intensity @xmath2 of any two - beam interferometer can be expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the intensities of the two combined beams , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the phases . assuming the optical path lengths of the two beams are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the phase difference is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical frequency of the light , and c is the speed of light .    for a fixed path interferometer , as the frequency of the laser",
    "is continuously scanned , the optical beams will constructively and destructively interfere , causing `` fringes '' .",

    "a schematic of the fsi system with a pair of optical fibers is shown in figure  [ fsi ] the light source is a new focus velocity 6308 tunable laser ( 665.1 nm @xmath23 675.2 nm ) . a high - finesse ( @xmath24 ) thorlabs sa200 f - p is used to measure the frequency range scanned by the laser .",
    "the free spectral range ( fsr ) of two adjacent f - p peaks is 1.5 ghz , which corresponds to 0.002 nm .",
    "a faraday isolator was used to reject light reflected back into the lasing cavity .",
    "the laser beam was coupled into a single - mode optical fiber with a fiber coupler .",
    "data acquisition is based on a national instruments daq card capable of simultaneously sampling 8 channels at a rate of 250 ks / s / ch with a precision of 12-bits .",
    "omega thermistors with a tolerance of 0.02 k and a precision of 0.01 @xmath25 are used to monitor temperature .",
    "the apparatus is supported on a damped newport optical table .    in order to reduce air flow and temperature fluctuations ,",
    "a transparent plastic box was constructed on top of the optical table .",
    "pvc pipes were installed to shield the volume of air surrounding the laser beam . inside the pvc pipes ,",
    "the typical standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about @xmath26 .",
    "temperature fluctuations were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic box and pvc pipes .",
    "detectors for hep experiments must usually be operated remotely for safety reasons because of intensive radiation , high voltage or strong magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other detector components , making access difficult . for practical hep application of fsi , optical fibers for light delivery and return",
    "are therefore necessary .",
    "the beam intensity coupled into the return optical fiber is very weak , requiring ultra - sensitive photodetectors for detection . considering the limited laser beam intensity used here and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of interferometers , it is vital to increase the geometrical efficiency . to this end",
    ", a collimator is attached to the optical fiber , the density of the outgoing beam from the optical fiber is increased significantly .",
    "the return beams are received by another optical fiber and amplified by a si femtowatt photoreceiver with a gain of @xmath27 .",
    "for a fsi system , drifts and vibrations occurring along the optical path during the scan will be magnified by a factor of @xmath28 , where @xmath11 is the average optical frequency of the laser beam and @xmath29 is the scanned frequency range . for the full scan of our laser , @xmath30 .",
    "small vibrations and drift errors that have negligible effects for many optical applications may have a significant impact on a fsi system . a single - frequency vibration may be expressed as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the amplitude , frequency and phase of the vibration , respectively . if @xmath35 is the start time of the scan , eq .",

    "if the measurement window size @xmath43 is fixed and the window used to measure a set of @xmath44 is sequentially shifted , the effects of the vibration will be evident .",
    "we use a set of distance measurements in one scan by successively shifting the fixed - length measurement window one f - p peak forward each time .",
    "the arithmetic average of all measured @xmath44 values in one scan is taken to be the measured distance of the scan ( although more sophisticated fitting methods can be used to extract the central value ) . for a large number of distance measurements @xmath45",
    ", the vibration effects can be greatly suppressed .",
    "of course , statistical uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination , dominant in our current system , can also be reduced with multiple scans .",
    "averaging multiple measurements in one scan , however , provides similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from independent scans , and is faster , more efficient , and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift . in this way",
    ", we can improve the distance accuracy dramatically if there are no significant drift errors during one scan , caused , for example , by temperature variation .",
    "this multiple - distance - measurement technique is called slip measurement window with fixed size , shown in figure  [ multi_dist ] .",
    "however , there is a trade off in that the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of @xmath45 because of the larger magnification factor @xmath46 for a smaller measurement window size .",
