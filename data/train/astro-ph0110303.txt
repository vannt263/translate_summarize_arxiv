    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies were first introduced as a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) by osterbrock and pogge ( 1985 ) .",
    "their optical spectra show narrow ( fwhm @xmath8 2000 km s@xmath2 ) permitted and forbidden lines , similar to seyfert 2 galaxies , but their emission - line ratios are more like those of seyfert 1 galaxies . in particular , osterbrock and pogge found that while the permitted lines are only slightly broader than the forbidden lines , these objects show strong fe  ii emission and [ o  iii ] @xmath95007/h@xmath10 ratios @xmath8 3 , indicating the presence of high density gas like that in the broad - line region ( blr ) of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "these authors note that the h@xmath10 equivalent widths of nls1s are smaller than typical values for normal seyfert 1s , suggesting that they are not just normal seyfert 1s seen at a special viewing angle .",
    "renewed interest in nls1s occurred when it was discovered that they have distinctive x - ray properties ; they show a steep soft x - ray excess with a photon index @xmath11 @xmath7 3 below 1  2 kev , a steep hard x - ray continuum with @xmath11 @xmath4 1.9 to 2.6 , and rapid large - amplitude x - ray variability on timescales of minutes to hours ( leighly 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , optical studies have established that nls1s lie at one end of the boroson & green ( 1992 ) eigenvector 1 for low - redshift quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies in that they show relatively strong fe  ii emission and weak [ o  iii ] emission ( boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ) .",
    "akn 564 ( z @xmath4 0.02467 and d @xmath4 99 mpc , assuming h@xmath12 @xmath4 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) is one of the brightest nls1s in the x - ray band ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ) , and shows intrinsic uv absorption lines in _ hst _ spectra ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ) . in order to explore the varability characteristics of a nls1 in different wave bands , we recently conducted a multiwavelength campaign on akn 564 .",
    "the optical monitoring campaign covered the periods 1998 november ",
    "1999 november and 2000 may ",
    "2001 january , and is described by shemmer et al .",
    "the uv campaign with the _ hubble space telescope _ was carried out on 2000 may 9  2000 july 8 and is described by collier et al .",
    "rxte _ and _ asca _ observations are described in pounds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and turner et al . ( 2001a ) , respectively . in this paper , we use the _ hst _ observations to explore the internal reddening in akn 564 and the physical conditions in the absorbing gas .",
    "_ hst _ spectra of the nucleus of akn 564 include those obtained with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "the details of these observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we retrieved the flux - calibrated fos spectra of akn 564 , as well as those of the nls1 galaxy mrk 493 for comparison , from the _ hst _ archives ( see crenshaw et al .",
    "[ 1999 ] for details on the mrk 493 observations ) .",
    "we combined these spectra in their regions of overlap to produce uv / optical spectra for both seyferts in the region 1150  6800  .",

    "the large wavelength coverage of these spectra is particularly useful for determining the reddening curve of akn 564 (  3 ) and the measured fluxes of a large number of uv / optical emission lines (  4 ) through a fixed aperture ( 086 in diameter ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , the stis spectra were obtained in an intensive monitoring campaign in 2000 may ",
    "collier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) give the details of the monitoring sequence and data reduction .",
    "for the current study , we used the low - dispersion g140l and g230l spectra averaged over 46 visits to assist in the identification of emission features and continuum regions in the uv .",
    "we note that the uv continuum fluxes varied mildly during this period ( the ratio of maximum to minimum flux at 1360   was 1.29 ) and that the fos uv continuum fluxes lie within this range ; they are lower than those of the average stis values by a factor of only 0.89 @xmath14 .",
    "the fos and stis emission - line fluxes are also the same to within 10% .    as part of the stis campaign",
    ", we observed the nucleus of akn 564 at high spectral resolution ( 7 km s@xmath2 fwhm ) with the e140 m grating ( see table 1 ) .",
    "our reduction of the e140 m spectra included a procedure to remove the background light from each order using a scattered light model devised by lindler ( 1998 ) .",
    "the individual orders in each echelle spectrum were spliced together in the regions of overlap , and the four individual echelle spectra were weighted by exposure time and averaged to produce a final e140 m spectrum .",
    "this spectrum was used in collier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to evaluate the contamination of the emission lines by the absorption lines . in this paper",
    ", we use the echelle observations to study the nature of the intrinsic uv absorption in this object (  5 ) .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the fos uv / optical spectra of akn 564 and mrk 493 ( the latter has been scaled and offset as described in the caption ) . the smooth curves are spline fits to continuum regions that are free of obvious contamination by absorption or emission lines , including the `` little blue bump '' between 2200 and 4200  , which consists of a blend of broad fe  ii and balmer recombination emission ( wills , netzer , & wills 1985 ) .",
    "the continuum spectrum of akn 564 is clearly much flatter than that of mrk 493 in the uv .",
    "this suggests that the spectrum of akn 564 may experience a significant amount of internal reddening .",
    "this is supported by the findings of walter & fink ( 1993 ) , who conclude that akn 564 is internally reddened based on the large observed h@xmath0/h@xmath10 ratio ( @xmath4 4.4 ) and the small ratio of ultraviolet to x - ray continuum flux compared to most seyfert 1 galaxies ( normal and nls1s ) in their sample .",
    "these measurements indicate significant internal reddening of the emission lines and uv / optical continuum , since reddening due to our galaxy is small ( see below ) .",
    "we present additional evidence for internal reddening , based on the he  ii @xmath91640/@xmath94686 ratio , in  4.3 .",
    "to determine the reddening curve for akn 564 , we used the fos spectrum of mrk 493 as a template .",
    "we assume that the uv / optical continuum of mrk 493 is 1 ) unreddened , except for a small galactic reddening of e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.03 ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) , and 2 ) represents the intrinsic continuum of akn 564 .",
    "the first assumption is based on the large rise of the mrk 493 spectrum in the uv , which is typical of unreddened seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "in particular , the continuum shape is nearly identical to that in the stis spectrum of the unreddened seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4151 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "in addition , the emission lines ( narrow plus broad ) of mrk 493 are essentially unreddened after correction for galactic reddening ; he  ii @xmath91640/@xmath94686",
    "@xmath4 8.0 @xmath15 1.9 , which is consistent with the intrinsic ratio of 7  9 from photoionization models of the nlr ( kraemer et al .",
    "1994 ) and blr ( rees , netzer , & ferland 1989 ) ) .",
    "the second assumption is based on the similarity of nls1 galaxies in a number of properties , including their emission - line ratios ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich et al .",
    "1989 ) and x - ray characteristics ( boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ; leighly 1999 ) .",
    "obviously , this assumption needs to explored with a larger sample of simultaneous uv and optical observations of nls1s , since there is likely to be intrinsic differences in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these objects ( the possible effects of these differences are discussed later in this section ) .",
    "most of the continuum and emission - line reddening of akn 564 must be intrinsic , since the galactic reddening is small .",
    "the maps of galactic dust ir emission from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) give e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.06 , whereas a power - law plus galactic extinction fit to the uv spectrum yields e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.03 ( s. collier 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "we adopt the latter value ( 0.03 ) , since correction of the observed spectrum for e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.06 places the 2200   continuum region well above a smooth continuum fit ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the galactic reddening is small compared to the internal reddening ( see below ) , so this choice has little effect on our results .",
    "to determine the reddening curve for akn 564 , we follow the technique used by crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in a study of the reddening and absorption in ngc  3227 .",
    "the continuum fits in figure 1 were each corrected for galactic reddening , using e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.03 and the standard galactic curve ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "we can immediately determine the value of e(b@xmath1v ) for the internal reddening : e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 2.5 [ log(x@xmath16 )  @xmath1  log(x@xmath17 ) ] , where x is the ratio of the mrk 493 continuum fit to that of akn  564 as a function of wavelength , and is evaluated at the effective wavelengths of the b ( 4400  ) and v ( 5500  ) filters . from this relation , we find that e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.14 mag for the internal reddening in akn 564 .",
    "we can also determine the reddening curve at any wavelength , relative to v and as per convention normalized to e(b@xmath1v ) ( savage & mathis 1979 ) :    @xmath18    where a@xmath16 , a@xmath17 , and a@xmath19 are the extinctions in magnitudes at b , v , and an arbitrary @xmath9 .    to determine the absolute extinction at any wavelength , we need to calibrate the above reddening curve : @xmath20    by determining the offset r@xmath17 @xmath21 a@xmath17/e(b@xmath1v ) . we make use of the result that the standard galactic , lmc , and smc extinction laws have essentially the same values at @xmath9  @xmath7  4500    ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) , and assume that this is the case for akn 564 .",
    "@xmath7 7000   ( cardelli et al . 1989 ) , but the fos wavelength coverage for akn 564 does not extend this far .",
    "] thus , r@xmath17 is the constant we need to add to e(@xmath9@xmath1v)/e(b@xmath1v ) to match these laws at long wavelengths .",
    "this yields r@xmath17 @xmath43.1 , which is also the standard galactic value ( savage & sembach 1979 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the extinction laws for the galaxy , lmc , and smc , along with the extinction law for akn  564 determined in the fashion described above .",
    "the extinction curve for akn  564 is unusual in that it diverges from the others at 4000  . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the curve climbs steadily with no evidence for the sharp curvature seen in other laws in the far - uv ; there is also no evidence for a 2200   bump , similar to the smc curve ( see  8) . by comparison",
    ", the extinction curve for ngc 3227 also begins to diverge from the other curves at 3500 ",
    "4000   , but rises even more sharply in the uv than the smc curve ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the principal uncertainty in the reddening curve of akn 564 is likely the assumption that its intrinsic sed is identical to that of mrk 493 ( which , as noted earlier in this section , is essentially the same as that of ngc  4151 in an average state ) .",
    "unfortunately , _ hst _",
    "observations of other unreddened seyfert 1 galaxies covering the full uv / optical range are not available to explore this issue",
    ". therefore , we use the extreme variations of ngc  4151 itself , which was monitored extensively with _",
    "iue_. clavel et al . (",
    "1990 ) find that the ratio of uv to optical continuum f@xmath19(1450)/f@xmath19(5000 ) varies by a factor of 3.1 , with high ratios corresponding to high uv fluxes .",
    "however , kaspi et al . (",
    "1996 ) find that a portion of this effect is due to a substantial galaxy contribution in the apertures used for optical observations ; subtracting the stellar flux at 5000   leads to a ratio that varies by a factor of 2.1 . assuming this extreme variation for this ratio , the reddening value and uncertainity at 1450   is therefore a@xmath19/e(b@xmath1v ) = 11.1 @xmath15 2.5 . with this assumption",
    ", the reddening curve for akn 564 could possibly be as shallow as the galactic curve in the uv or somewhat steeper than the lmc curve , but not as steep as the curves for the smc or ngc 3227 .",
    "on the other hand , the extinction determined from the observed he ii @xmath91640/@xmath94686 ratio is nearly identical to that derived for the continuum (  4.3 ) and the error in this ratio is only @xmath2230% , suggesting that the uncertainty in the reddening curve is much smaller than the conservative estimate quoted above .",
    "we have measured the emission - line fluxes in the fos spectrum of akn 564 to determine the reddening from the he ii lines and for a future investigation into the physical conditions in the emission - line regions and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing continuum flux ( p. romano et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as is typical for seyfert 1 galaxies , there are strong contributions to the spectrum from a high - density region responsible for lines such as fe  ii ( the classic blr in normal seyfert 1s ) and a lower density region responsible for forbidden lines such as [ o  iii ] ( the nlr ) .",
    "since akn 564 is a nls1 , these contributions are strongly blended together .",
    "although the permitted lines tend to show broader wings than the forbidden lines , which is typical in these objects ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1989 ) , they are not sufficiently broad to deconvolve the broad and narrow components , particularly at this spectral resolution .",
    "we therefore measured the total emission from each line .",
    "we measured the emission line fluxes of most of the lines by direct integration of their fluxes over the continuum fit . for severe blends ( e.g. , h@xmath0 , [ n  ii ] @xmath96548 , 6584 )",

    ", we used the emission - line fits from the stis echelle spectra ( see  5 ) .",
    "we determined the line ratios relative to h@xmath10 and corrected these ratios for reddening using the akn 564 curve in figure 2 , with e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.14 ( @xmath150.04 ) , and the standard galactic curve , with e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.03 ( our justification for using the akn 564 continuum reddening curve is given in  4.3 . )",
    "we determined errors in the dereddened ratios from the sum in quadrature of the errors from photon noise , different reasonable continuum placements , and reddening .",
    "we show the observed and dereddened line ratios in table 2 .",
    "the c  ii @xmath91334 emission is undetectable in this object , whereas it is clearly seen in the uv spectra of most seyfert galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "there are no galactic or intrinsic absorption features that could mask the c  ii emission .",
    "[ o  iii ] @xmath92321 and c  ii ] @xmath92326 are not evident as well , but their absence could be explained by the presence of galactic fe  ii @xmath132374 , 2382 absorption at the redshifted positions of these emission lines .      to place a limit on the size of the nlr in akn 564 , we examined the two - dimensional stis spectral images ( there are no narrow - band _ hst _ images ) .",
    "we find that the spatial profiles of the continuum and strong emission lines ( l@xmath0 , mg  ii ) along the slit are identical and indistinguishable from a point source ( the spatial resolution is 005  01 fwhm in the uv ) . from the l@xmath0 spatial profile",
    ", we find that at least 85% of the emission - line flux must come from a region that is @xmath2302 ( 95 pc ) from the nucleus ( assuming circular symmetry ) .",
    "thus , the nlr is compact ( at least along this direction ) , which is often the case for seyfert 1 galaxies ( schmitt & kinney 1996 ) .",
    "we can investigate the reddening of the emission lines in a manner independent of our continuum reddening analysis , since the ratios of the he  ii lines vary only slightly with temperature and density ( seaton 1978 ) .",
    "the intrinsic he  ii @xmath91640/@xmath94686 ratio is @xmath227 for the nlr ( kraemer et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath229 for the blr ( rees et al .",

    "the differential extinction is a@xmath19(1640 ) @xmath1 a@xmath19(4686 ) @xmath4 0.95  1.22 mag , by comparison , the continuum extinction curve yields a@xmath19(1640 ) @xmath1 a@xmath19(4686 ) @xmath4 0.95 mag .",
    "these values are in good agreement , although it is possible that the emission lines experience a slight amount of additional extinction ( cf . ,",
    "kraemer et al .",
    "the similar extinctions for continuum and emission lines justifies our use of the continuum reddening curve in  4.1 .",
    "the simplest explanation is a dust screen that lies outside of and covers both the continuum source and emission - line regions ( including the nlr ) , similar to the situation for ngc 3227 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "one might expect that the intrinsic uv absorption lines could arise from gas associated with the dust ; this possibility is explored in  7 .",
    "as noted in  2 , the fos spectra of akn 564 show intrinsic absorption from l@xmath0 , n  v , si  iv , and c  iv ; these lines are also seen in the low - dispersion stis spectra ( collier et al .",
    "the stis echelle spectra resolve these lines , as shown in figure 3 , which plots the absorption as a function of radial velocity ( for the stronger member of the doublets ) relative to the systemic redshift of z @xmath4 0.02467 , determined from the h  i 21-cm line ( de vaucouleurs , et al .",
    "we have also discovered the presence of intrinsic si  iii @xmath91206.5 absorption at the same approximate radial velocity as the si  iv absorption . however , there is no evidence for the presence of lower ionization lines , such as c  ii @xmath91334.5 or si  ii @xmath91260.4 .",
    "it is clear from figure 3 that the l@xmath0 , n  v , and c  iv absorption lines are completely saturated , and there is no hope for separating individual kinematic components .",
    "si  iv and si  iii appear not to be saturated , and common narrow kinematic components can be seen in these lines . due to the noise and inherent difficulty in deblending these components , we treat the absorption as a single large kinematic component in our analysis .",
    "this treatment is appropriate if there are no large variations in the physical conditions as a function of radial velocity .    to measure the absorption lines",
    ", we fitted cubic splines to the continuum and emission lines , using the high signal - to - noise low - dispersion spectra as a guide .",
    "we then divided the echelle spectrum by the spline fit to normalize the absorption profiles .",
    "for the heavily saturated lines , we obtained a lower limit to c@xmath24 , the covering of the continuum plus emission by the absorber in the line of sight , from the residual flux ( i@xmath25 ) in the troughs : c@xmath24 @xmath4 1.0 @xmath1 i@xmath25 .",

    "the values are very close to one , which indicates that all of the emission - line gas in this velocity range is occulted by the absorber .",
    "since the narrow - line region ( nlr ) gas occupies this velocity range ( @xmath15 500 km s@xmath2 , based on the optical [ o  iii ] lines ) , _ the absorber must occult the nlr as well_. for example , based on the strengths of the forbidden [ ne  v ] lines ( table 2 ) , we know that the nlr gas in this object is highly ionized , with an ionization parameter similar to that of the compact nlr in ngc 5548 ( kraemer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if we use the narrow c iv/[o iii ] ratio from ngc 5548 to estimate the narrow c  iv flux in akn 564 , and assume the nlr is not covered , the c iv troughs reach an intensity of @xmath220.5 , instead of the observed value of zero seen in figure 3 .",
    "the radial velocity centroids of the absorption lines are given in table 3 ; these values are relative to the systemic redshift .",
    "the discrepant values can be attributed to the effects of saturation .",
    "the total column of gas is apparently smaller at more positive radial velocities , as indicated by the si lines ( assuming constant ionization parameter across the profiles ) .",

    "figure 4 shows the incident and transmitted continua for the models ( see  6.2 ) .",

    "given the evidence for a large column of dusty gas and the absence of c  ii in absorption , we have used a standard depletion of 85% of the carbon onto grains ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "however , the presence of si  iii in absorption argues against the presence of silicate grains , and we have therefore assumed no depletions of other elements.1334.5 emission line is not detected and the c  iv @xmath91550 and c  iii ] @xmath91909 emission lines appear to be relatively weak in akn 564 compared to lines such as n  v @xmath91240 , n iii ] @xmath91750 and si  iii ] @xmath91890 ( table 2 ) .",
    "although this could result from a combination of high densities ( kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "2000 ) and unusual abundance ratios ( wills et al . 1999 ; mathur 2000 ) , another explanation is that the carbon has been removed from gas phase by depletion onto dust grains . ]",
    "we modeled the uv absorber as a single - zone and arrived at the following best - fit parameters : u @xmath4 0.033 and n@xmath35 @xmath4 1.62 x 10@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "the predicted ionic columns are listed in table 3 and , generally , provide a good fit to the observed column densities .",
    "the predictions for ly@xmath0 , c  iv , and n  v exceed the lower limits , while those for c  ii and si  ii are consistent with their upper limits . the predicted column for si  iv is close to the observed value and ,",
    "although the predicted si  iii column is somewhat high , it is within a factor of 2 of that observed . in table 4 , we list predicted column densities for the ions c  iii , n  iii , and o  vi , which can produce absorption lines observable in the _ fuse _ bandpass ( 910  1185   ) , and o  vii and o  viii , from which strong bound - free edges and absorption lines associated with `` warm '' absorbers arise ( reynolds 1997 ; george et al . 1998 ) .",
    "based on the most recent _ asca _ spectra ( turner et al .",
    "2001a ) , we determined upper limits for the bound - free optical depths and column densities of o  vii ( @xmath47 @xmath23 0.054 , n@xmath48 @xmath23 2.2 x 10@xmath49 @xmath6 ) and o  viii",
    "( @xmath50 @xmath23 0.001 , n@xmath51 @xmath23 1.1 x 10@xmath52 @xmath6 ) , which are consistent with our model predictions .",
    "the total hydrogen column in our model would yield a reddening value of e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.31 for a galactic dust - to - gas ratio , from the relation given by shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) .",
    "our derived internal reddening for this object is e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath4 0.14 , which is consistent with the lower than galactic dust - to - gas ratio in our model , due to the absence of silicate grains . in any case , the uv absorber has enough column to produce the observed reddening . given that the uv absorber covers the nlr in akn 564 , the dusty gas must lie further than 95 pc from the active nucleus ( see  4.2 ) and have a density of n@xmath35 @xmath23 10@xmath53 @xmath54 based on our model parameters .",
    "there are two additional considerations that must be addressed .",
    "first , although the models show that the uv absorption is consistent with carbon depletion , the spectrum of akn 564 shows no evidence for a 2200   extinction feature .",
    "however , this feature is typically absent in reddened agn ( pittman , clayton , & gordon 1999 ) , and , in any event , its origin is not well understood .",
    "second , since emission - lines will arise in the absorber , its covering factor is constrained by the observed emission - line fluxes .",
    "for example , the absorber we have modeled at a radial distance of 95 pc would require a global covering factor of 0.05 to account for all of the observed [ ne  v ] @xmath93426 and 80% of [ o  iii ] @xmath95007 . since there may be significant [ o  iii ] @xmath95007 emission from the gas in which low ionization lines such as [ n  ii ] @xmath96584 and [ o  ii ] @xmath93227 form ( see kraemer et al .",
    "2000a ) , the covering factor of the absorber may be somewhat less than this value .",
    "to summarize , the absorber is of sufficiently high ionization state to produce saturated n  v and c  iv absorption lines .",
    "we predict o  vii and o  viii column densities much lower than that associated with the `` warm '' absorbers detected in _ asca _ spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies ( reynolds 1997 ; george et al 1998 ) .",
    "hence , we arrive at the same conclusion as that for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3227 ( kraemer et al . 2000b ; crenshaw et al . 2001 ) : the dust is embedded in a `` lukewarm absorber '' which lies outside of the nlr .",
    "our motivations for this study were to investigate the intrinsic uv absorption revealed in the fos archive spectra of akn  564 , and observed at high resolution with stis during the recent monitoring campaign , and to evaluate the reddening of the uv continuum fluxes for a study of the intrinsic sed ( p. romano et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in doing so",
    ", we have discovered that the intrinsic absorption and reddening are linked in this object , in that the absorbing gas has a sufficient column ( n@xmath3 @xmath4 1.6 x 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) and distance from the continuum source ( d @xmath7 95 pc ) to contain the dust that reddens the continuum source , blr , and compact nlr .",
    "the properties of the absorbing gas in akn 564 are very similar to those in the dusty lukewarm absorber in ngc  3227 ( n@xmath3 @xmath4 2.0 x 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , d @xmath7 92 pc ; crenshaw et al .",
    "2001 ) , suggesting a common origin . one interesting difference , however , is the derived reddening curve ; in ngc 3227 , it is much steeper in the uv , suggesting a preponderence of small dust grains ( crenshaw et al .",
    "simultaneous uv / optical spectra of additional reddened seyfert galaxies , covering a broad wavelength range ( e.g. , 1150  10,000  ) at high spatial resolution ( @xmath2201 , to minimize contamination by the host galaxy ) would be helpful in exploring the range of reddening curves in seyferts .",
    "the ionization state of the gas is relatively high in both ngc  3227 ( u @xmath4 0.13 ) and akn  564 ( u @xmath4 0.032 ) , but not high enough ( given the n@xmath3 columns ) to produce observable o  vii and o  viii edges detectable by _ asca _ ( although possibly detectable through absorption lines in _ chandra _ spectra ) .",
    "thus , these absorbers do not qualify as `` dusty warm absorbers '' , which have been claimed in several agn , including ngc  3227 ( komossa & fink 1997 ) . as noted in kraemer et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the dusty lukewarm absorber provides a more natural explanation , since it can be placed at large distances ( @xmath7 100 pc ) from the nucleus and account for not only the reddening of the continuum source and blr , but the observed reddening of the nlr as well . as in the case of ngc  3227 and akn  564 ,",
    "the dusty lukewarm absorber can be identified in reddened sources through the detection of strong uv absorption lines near the systemic redshift .",
    "dusty lukewarm absorbers likely originate from a different location than the majority of known intrinsic absorption systems in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the latter tend to be variable and , in many cases , exhibit high outflow velocities ( up to 2100 km s@xmath2 , crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , indicating an origin close to the nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the dusty lukewarm absorbers in the two objects we have studied are located outside of the majority of the nlr emission .",
    "interestingly , the galactic disks of both seyferts are inclined to our line of sight ( @xmath55 63  for ngc  3227 , @xmath55 59  for akn  564 ; de zotti & gaskell 1985 ) , yielding a line of sight with a larger optical depth that intercepts more of the host galaxy s disk compared to face - on ( @xmath56 0 ) seyfert galaxies .",
    "there is ample morphological and kinematic evidence that the extended narrow - line region ( enlr ) in a seyfert galaxy is ionized gas in the galactic disk ( cf .",
    ", unger et al . 1987 ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that the dusty lukewarm absorber is a highly ionized component in the enlr that we see when looking through the host galaxy s disk .",
