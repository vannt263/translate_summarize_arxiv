    "the _ slopes _ of a piecewise linear function are the different values of @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "gomory and johnson @xcite gave many examples of facets , and in all their examples the facets are piecewise linear .",
    "this led them to formulate the following conjecture , which they describe as `` important and challenging '' .",
    "[ conj]every continuous facet for   is piecewise linear .",
    "we show that the above conjecture is false by exhibiting a facet for ( [ si ] ) that is continuous but not piecewise linear .",
    "the definition of valid function we stated , which is the one given by gomory and johnson in  @xcite , differs from the one adopted later by the same two authors in  @xcite , where they included in the definition the further assumption that the function @xmath7 be continuous .",
    "so a `` valid function '' in  @xcite corresponds to a `` continuous valid function '' from  @xcite and the present paper .",
    "dey et al .",
    "@xcite show that there are facets that are not continuous .",
    "the definition of facet given in our paper is identical to the one given by gomory and johnson in  @xcite , with the caveat that in  @xcite valid functions are required to be continuous .",
    "thus , given a continuous valid function @xmath7 , @xmath7 would be a facet according to the definition in  @xcite if and only if @xmath22 implies @xmath14 for every _ continuous _ valid function @xmath15 . for clarity",
    ", we refer to a continuous valid function satisfying the latter property as a _ facet in the sense of gomory - johnson_. by definition , if a continuous valid function is a facet , it is also a facet in the sense of gomory - johnson .",
    "thus , the conjecture they state in  @xcite is actually that _ every facet in the sense of gomory - johnson is piecewise linear_. the above discussion shows that a counterexample to conjecture  [ conj ] also disproves the conjecture in  @xcite .    in earlier work ,",
    "gomory and johnson  @xcite emphasized extreme functions rather than facets .",
    "a valid function @xmath7 is _ extreme _ if it can not be expressed as a convex combination of two distinct valid functions .",
    "it follows from the definition that facets are extreme .",
    "therefore our counterexample also provides an extreme function that is continuous but not piecewise linear .",
    "gomory and johnson  @xcite write in a footnote that the definition of facet `` is different from , although eventually equivalent to , '' the definition of extreme function .",
    "the statement that extreme functions are facets appears to be quite nontrivial to prove , and to the best of our knowledge there is no proof in the literature .",
    "we therefore cautiously treat extreme functions and facets as distinct concepts , and leave their equivalence as an open question .",
    "we obtain the counterexample to conjecture  [ conj ] by exhibiting a sequence of piecewise linear functions and then considering the pointwise limit of this sequence of functions .",

    "we finally show that the function @xmath132 is a facet .",
    "the function @xmath132 is a facet for the problem ( [ si ] ) .",
    "we will use the facet theorem ( theorem  [ thm : facet_thm ] ) .",
    "we show that if a minimal valid function satisfies the set of equalities @xmath314 , then it coincides with @xmath132 everywhere .",
    "consider any minimal valid function @xmath315 that satisfies the set of equalities @xmath314 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath316 , then @xmath317 .",
    "we first show the following .",
    "_ claim 1 .",
    "@xmath318 _    for any maximal interval @xmath296a , b[$ ]",
    "over which the graph of @xmath132 has a negative slope , consider the following intervals : @xmath319 $ ] , @xmath320 $ ] and therefore @xmath321 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath316 for @xmath65 , @xmath67 .",
    "this implies @xmath322 .",
    "now lemma  [ interval_lemma ] ( the interval lemma ) implies that @xmath315 are straight lines over @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we now use an inductive argument to prove that not only do the slopes of @xmath132 and @xmath315 coincide on intervals where the slope of @xmath132 is negative , in fact @xmath323 for all @xmath222 in these intervals .",
    "every maximal segment @xmath4 with negative slope in @xmath132 also appears in @xmath146 for some @xmath223 ( i.e. @xmath324 for some @xmath223 ) .",
    "let @xmath325 be the least such @xmath223 .",
    "we prove that @xmath326 for every @xmath4 with negative slope by induction on @xmath325 .",
    "@xmath327 and @xmath328 since @xmath315 is assumed to be a valid inequality .",
    "this implies that @xmath315 is the same as @xmath132 in the range @xmath329 $ ] .",
    "this proves the base case of the induction .    by the induction hypothesis",
    ", we assume the claim is true for negative - slope segments @xmath4 with @xmath330 .",
    "consider all negative - slope segments @xmath4 with @xmath331 . amongst these",
    "consider the segment @xmath332 which is closest to the origin .",
    "let the midpoint of this segment be @xmath333 .",
    "we know that @xmath334 is the start of a negative - slope segment @xmath335 in @xmath132 with @xmath336 . by construction , @xmath337 .",
    "so @xmath338 . from the induction hypothesis , we know that @xmath339 and so @xmath340 .",
    "now consider any other negative - slope segment @xmath4 with @xmath341 and let its midpoint be @xmath342 .",
    "note that @xmath343 is the start of a negative - slope segment @xmath335 with @xmath336 .",
    "so @xmath344 because of the inductive hypothesis .",
    "note that @xmath345 by construction .",
    "so , @xmath346 . since we showed that @xmath347 , ( [ eq1 ] ) implies that @xmath348 .",
    "since the values coincide at the midpoints of these segments and the slopes of the segments are the same , @xmath349 for any @xmath222 in the domain of these segments .",
    "this concludes the proof of claim  1 .",
    "we now use claim  1 to show that @xmath350 by lemma [ lemma : psi - subadditive ] @xmath132 is a minimal valid function and @xmath315 is assumed to be minimal , thus symmetry combined with ( [ eq : less ] ) would imply that @xmath351 .",
    "_ claim 2 .",

    "for every positive integer @xmath23 , there exists @xmath353 such that @xmath354 and @xmath355 . _",
