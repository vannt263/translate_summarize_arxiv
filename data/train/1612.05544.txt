    "a promising candidate for thermally tunable nanophotonic devices is gainp which became popular during recent years @xcite . its thermal conductivity @xcite is more than 6 times smaller than for si and @xmath3 , which in addition to absence of two - photon absorption at 1550 nm and favorable nonlinear properties @xcite makes it a promising candidate for thermally tunable photonics . in this work",
    "we investigate the thermal response of a single photonic crystal nanocavity made of ga@xmath0in@xmath1p .",
    "our analysis allows us to obtain the thermo - optic coefficient of refractive index for this material whose precise value has not been reported in the literature to our knowledge .",
    "to experimentally measure the thermo - optical coefficient of the ga@xmath0in@xmath1p a nanophotonic sample containing photonic crystal nanocavities was mounted on a thermally controlled stage , so the sample was homogeneously heated and the temperature was locked with a precision of @xmath4 . in a separate non - thermal run",
    "the sample itself was replaced by a pt-100 sensor , its temperature was never different from the base temperature by more than 2.1 k. the temperatures reported further are referred to this sample position .",
    "the sample is an air - suspended photonic crystal membrane with a linear array of 10 directly coupled mode - gap photonic crystal nanocavities made of ga@xmath0in@xmath1p .",
    "the thickness of semiconductor membrane is 180 nm .",

    "red holes are shifted away from the waveguide by 6 nm , green - by 4 nm and purple ones are shifted by 2 nm to create a cavity mode .",
    "such cavities are known for large experimentally measured q - factors @xcite and therefore they are suitable for precise thermal measurements .",

    "the light was coupled into and out - coupled from the structure with polarization - maintaining lensed fibers @xmath10 and @xmath11 with na=0.55 .",
    "the out - coupled light was collected on an ir photodiode for transmission measurements .",
    "the sample was kept in nitrogen atmosphere to avoid oxidation @xcite .",

    "spectra for all temperatures are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the resonance experiences a redshift which signifies that the material has a positive thermo - optical response .",
    "all spectra have a fano - like line shape .",
    "there was no systematic change of the q - factor which signifies that within this temperature range the mode - profile of the cavity does not change . in total",
    "the resonance redshifts by about 4.5 nm when the temperature rises by approximately 49.5 @xmath9 .",
    "the dependence of resonance wavelength on the temperature of the sample is presented in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the resonance wavelength changes linearly with increasing temperature , with a tuning slope of @xmath15 .    when a sample is heated , any water film is evaporated from the surface which causes a resonance blueshift @xcite .",
    "the exact magnitude of this resonance shift depends on details of the surface condition . in laser heating experiments with similar temperature changes",
    "we have observed this shift to be 360 pm or less . to account for this a priori unknown shift",
    "we add an error term of 5% , resulting in @xmath16 .",

    ", it can be shown that @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are equal to : @xmath20 @xmath21 here @xmath18 is the relative resonance wavelength change caused by the refractive index change @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the dielectric constant of the membrane material and @xmath24 is the electric field of the cavity mode . as follows from eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] the change of the resonance wavelength is proportional to the fraction of the electric - field energy inside the membrane @xmath25 , taking into account that the change in the refractive index of ambient nitrogen is negligible .",
    "according to our 3d fdtd calculations the fraction of electric - field energy in the membrane is 0.88 .",
    "@xmath19 is the relative wavelength change due to the thermal expansion of the membrane , where @xmath26 is the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "the @xmath2 value can be finally obtained from : @xmath27    the thermal expansion coefficient @xcite @xmath26 for ga@xmath0in@xmath1p is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the experimentally measured value of @xmath2 is then equal to @xmath29 .",
    "we note that in case of gainp linear expansion gives a noticeable contribution to the tuning slope of the cavity resonance . without taking into account that effect",
    "the value of @xmath2 would be about 10% larger .",
    "the value for @xmath2 is about 30% smaller than the value obtained earlier @xcite .",
    "the previous value was obtained as a result of comparison between complex modeling and experiment .",
    "we surmise that uncertainty of thermal conductivity of materials as well as laser power estimation in the focus may have led to overestimation of the result .",
    "moreover , in this paper the sample was heated homogeneously so @xmath30 was measured , while for the experiment with local laser heating , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 was measured , which is actually a value for a stressed material as the membrane could not expand .",
    "the present experiment does not depend on laser pump power and thermal conductivity of the membrane material and therefore the obtained value of @xmath2 corresponds to stress - free ga@xmath0in@xmath1p .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the thermo - optical effect of the refractive index for ga@xmath0in@xmath1p .",
    "our measurement took place for a freely expanding membrane and we took into account the effect of thermal expansion of the material .",
    "we found no significant q - factor change during our measurement which guarantees that the working wavelength of photonic devices based on nanocavities made of ga@xmath0in@xmath1p can be safely biased with temperature within the range of about 5 nm .",
    "this work enables precise thermal tuning of gainp based photonic devices , which is relevant as one of the lowest thermal conductivity semiconductors used in photonics .",
