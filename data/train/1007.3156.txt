    "considering the fact that the peak at @xmath29 is higher than that at @xmath28 , it may be expected that the g - type af state is easier to be stabilized than the c - type af state .",

    "we calculate the total energies of different magnetic states as function of volume . as shown in fig.[ev_ldac ] , the c - type af state is always stabilized for all the calculated volumes . in other words , the c - type af state is the most stable state even without any lattice distortion .",
    "this is one of our main conclusions , which will be carefully discussed in this part .    from the energetic point of view , as shown in fig.[ev_ldac ] , the energy difference between the nm and the fm states is small ( about 54mev / f.u . , if experimental lattice parameter is used ) , and the fm state is easily suppressed by volume compression . on the other hand , there exists a big energy difference ( larger than 100mev / f.u . ) between the fm and various af states , and the energy differences among various af states ( a - type , c - type and g - type ) are small ( about 20mev / f.u.@xmath3450mev / f.u . ) . in view of this fact together with the fact suggested by calculated response function fig.[nesting ] that itinerant picture alone can not fully explain the magnetic property , the superexchange must play some role to stabilize the af states .",
    "the subtle balance between the itinerant kinetic energy and superexchange leads to the c - type af ground state .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments of various states as functions of volume are shown in fig.[mag_vol ] . at the equilibrium volume ,",
    "the high spin states are always favored , and the magnetic moments of various states are close to 2.0@xmath35/cr , suggesting the sizable hund s coupling .",
    "the calculated moment are 1.63@xmath35/cr , 1.59@xmath36/cr , 1.56@xmath35/cr , 1.55@xmath35/cr for fm , a - type , c - type , g - type states respectively . for the fm state ,",
    "the magnetic moment quickly collapses with volume compression as show in fig.[mag_vol ] , but for the af states ( a - type , c - type and g - type ) , the moments are not so sensitive to the volume change .",
    "this again suggests that although the system is close to itinerant stoner instability , the stabilization of af states is beyond the stoner mechanism .",
    "although we only treat the cubic structure , the a - type and c - type magnetic ordering will further break the symmetry , and lead to orbital ordering .",
    "as shown in fig.[pdos_fm]-[pdos_g ] and listed in table i , the degeneracy between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 orbitals is lifted in the presence of a - type or c - type af states .",
    "more importantly , the a - type and c - type af states lead to different orbital ordering : the occupation of @xmath1 orbital is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath2 orbitals for the c - type ( a - type ) af state .",
    "recall the fact that current calculations are based on cubic structure , the observed orbital ordering must be purely due to the effect of magnetic orderings . if we evaluate the orbital polarization as the occupation number difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 orbitals , defined as @xmath37 , the calculated values suggest that the polarization is about @xmath38 and @xmath39 electrons for the a - type and c - type af state respectively .",
    "now we have to answer several important questions : ( 1 ) why the types of orbital ordering are opposite for a - type and c - type af states ? ( 2 ) why the c - type af state is more stable than the a - type af state ? to answer these questions , the detailed understanding to",
    "the superexchange is important . through the superexchange mechanism ,",
    "the system gains energy from hybridizations : the hybridization between the occupied states ( at one site ) and the unoccupied states ( at neighboring sites ) will lower the energy of the occupied states by approximately @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an effective transfer integral and @xmath42 is an energy difference between occupied and unoccupied states .",
    "we start from the c - type af state in which the spins of two adjacent cr@xmath5 ions lie antiparallely in @xmath43-plane but parallely along @xmath44-axis .",
    "the occupied majority spin @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) orbital is pushed down by hybridization with unoccupied majority spin @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) orbital located at nearest - neighboring cr site in @xmath43-plane ( the effect is forbidden along the @xmath44-axis due to the parallel spin chain ) .",
    "such hybridization process can happen four times for @xmath1 orbital , but only two times for @xmath2 orbital due to its spacial orientation .",
    "therefore , the occupied majority spin @xmath1 orbital is pushed down more strongly than the @xmath2 orbitals due to the larger hybridization . applying the same analysis to the a - type af state in which the spins of two adjacent cr@xmath5 ions lie parallely in @xmath43-plane but antiparallely along @xmath44-axis , only the hybridization paths along the @xmath44-axis need to be considered .",
    "now , for the a - type af state , the hybridization process can happen two times for @xmath2 orbital , but zero time for @xmath1 orbital again due to its spacial orientation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 state is lower than the @xmath1 state for the a - type af state , in opposite to the situation in c - type af state .",
    "this will answer the first question listed above . due to the same reason",
    ", the system can gain energy from eight possible hybridization paths in the c - type af state , but only four paths in a - type af state .",
    "this is the reason why the c - type af state is more stable than a - type af state .    according to the above mechanism",
    ", it is immediately realized that the g - type af state should be more stable than a - type or c - type af states .",
    "why it is not the case from the first principle calculations ?",
    "the reason is following : applying the superexchange mechanism in the above discussion , we assume that the majority spin @xmath1 or @xmath2 orbitals are fully occupied .",
    "this is of course not the case , due to the large band width and the small splitting between these @xmath17 orbitals , the system is always metallic and these @xmath17 states are partially occupied .",
    "in this situation , stoner mechanism , which favors itinerant ferromagnetism due to the kinetic energy gain , also plays its role , and finally the full af state ( i.e , the g - type af state ) lost its energy gain .",
    "the system prefers to keep certain fm spin orientation along particular directions , such as @xmath44-axis in c - type and @xmath43-plane in a - type af state .",
    "therefore , the stabilization of c - type af state comes from the subtle balance between the itinerant stoner mechanism and the superexchange .    to further prove our above discussion , we performed the following calculations . keeping the cubic lattice structure ,",
    "we calculate the energy difference between various magnetic state as function of number of electrons .",
    "the virtual crystal approximation(vca )  @xcite is used here to simplify our studies .",
    "for the parent compound , the total number of @xmath17 electron on cr@xmath5 is 2 . by increasing the number of @xmath4 electrons , the majority spin @xmath17 states tend to be fully occupied . as we can see from fig.[e - doping ] , if we increase the number of electrons , indeed the g - type af state is stabilized .     the calculated total energy ( relative to the fm spin state ) as function of charge doping by virtual crystal approximation(vca).,width=302 ]      in our above analysis",
    ", only the cubic structure is treated .",
    "however , the tetragonally distorted structure is also observed experimentally , the possible tetragonal distortion and its effect on electronic structure must be studied . the tetragonal phase must be energetically very close to the cubic phase , duo to the reported coexistence of these two phases at low temperature@xcite . therefore ,",
    "in this section , we try to understand the effect of tetragonal structure distortion .",
    "the main conclusions drew from this section are following : ( 1 ) if tetragonal distortion is allowed , the compression ( rather than elongation ) along the @xmath44-axis should be favored , in consistent with experimental observation .",
    "( 2 ) c - type af state and corresponding orbital ordering are further stabilized by compressive tetragonal distortion .",
    "( 3 ) the energy gain due to tetragonal distortion ( about 10mev / cr ) is smaller than that coming from the superexchange ( about 100mev / cr ) discussed above . ( 4 ) the orbital polarization induced by tetragonal distortion is much smaller than that caused by magnetic orderings .    the calculated total energy versus volume for all kinds of spin states by lda .",
    "the lattice distortion ( c / a ratio ) is optimized for each fixed volume , and @xmath33 is the experimental volume.,width=302 ]    the optimized @xmath45 ratio for a - type and c - type af state at different volume .",
    "volume compression will suppress the lattice distortion .",
    "@xmath33 is the experimental volume.,width=302 ]    fig.[ev_ldat ] shows the optimized total energy as function of volume after allowing the tetragonal distortion . comparing with the cubic results shown in fig.[ev_ldac ] ,",
    "the qualitative picture is not changed at all .",
    "the c - type af state is still the most stable state , and a big energy difference exists between the fm state and the various af states .",
    "however , what is interesting is that the c - type af state favors compressive distortion , and a - type af state favors elongation distortion along the @xmath44-axis as shown in fig.[optim ] . for the most stable c - type af state , the optimized c / a ratio is 0.990 , in good agreement with the experimentally observed tetragonal distortion ( c / a=0.992 )",
    "such an opposite tendency for a - type and c - type af states can be easily understood from the orbital polarization discussed above . in the c - type af state ,",
    "the @xmath1 orbital is more occupied than the @xmath2 orbitals , therefore @xmath44-axis compression is favored due to the reduction of electron static potential .",
    "the opposite is true for a - type af state .",
    "as we expected , the lattice distortion will further enhance the orbital polarization , and stabilize the a or c - type af states .",
    "in reality , a - type and c - type af states are further stabilized by only @xmath46mev / cr and @xmath47mev / cr respectively , comparing with their cubic phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the fm and g - type af states have no energy gain by lattice distortion .",
    "another important issue is the origin of orbital polarization observed both in experiment and lda calculations .",
    "since both lattice distortion ( due to crystal field ) and af magnetic ordering due to superexchange mechanism can lead to orbital polarization , we have to determine which one is the dominate factor . from our lda calculations shown in table i",
    ", it is suggested that the magnetic ordering should be the dominant factor .",
    "first of all , the energy gain due to the lattice distortion is small ( less than 10mev ) , even smaller than the energy difference among the a - type , c - type , g - type af states ( about@xmath48mev ) calculated in the cubic phase .",
    "second , as shown in table i , where the calculated orbital polarization of various magnetic states for different @xmath45 ratio are listed , the orbital polarization coming from the lattice distortion is smaller than that coming from the superexchange effect calculated in the cubic phase .",
    "finally , we conclude that although the tetragonal distortion is favored , the distorted phase is energetically close to the cubic phase , in consistent with experimental results of coexistence of the two phases . on the other hand ,",
    "an electronic structure transition reported experimentally around 4 gpa  @xcite is not observed from our calculations .",
    ".the orbital polarization , evaluated as the occupation number difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 orbitals ( i.e , @xmath37 ) , for various magnetic states with different @xmath45 ratio . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the calculated total energy ( relative to the fm solution ) of different magnetic states as function of @xmath3 by lda+@xmath3 method.,width=302 ]     orbital occupation versus correlation parameter @xmath3 for a - type and c - type af state in the cubic lattice structure calculated by lda+@xmath3.,width=302 ]    one important issue in transition metal compounds is the possible strong correlation , which can not be treated successfully by lda level calculations .",
    "we therefore need to check the effect of electron correlation by advanced technique .",
    "given the fact that srcro@xmath0 should be more itinerant than cacro@xmath0 due to the lager band width , and also the fact that most of the electron properties calculated above using lda for srcro@xmath0 can be well compared with experiment , we expect that the effect of on - site coulomb @xmath3 is not significant .",
    "nevertheless , we will show , in this part by lda+@xmath3 calculations , that the srcro@xmath0 system is indeed not strongly correlated system . in principle , lda+@xmath3 is a cheap technique , which is suitable for strongly correlated af insulating state ( large @xmath3 limit ) , however we will show that the lda+@xmath3 results for srcro@xmath0 are nonphysical if large @xmath3 is applied .",
    "fig.[e_u ] shows the calculated total energy relative to fm state as function of @xmath3 .",
    "we can see clearly that the a - type af state is stabilized at large @xmath3 limit ( @xmath49ev ) , which is not consistent with experiment .",
    "what is more surprising is that , for the c - type af state , an orbital ordering transition is observed , as shown in fig.[oo_u ] .",
    "for the small @xmath3 limit , the @xmath1 orbital is more populated than @xmath2 orbitals , however for the large @xmath3 limit , the @xmath2 orbital become more occupied , in opposite to the small @xmath3 limit .",
    "the appearance of this transition can be understood as the following . in the high spin configuration of cr@xmath5",
    ", the two @xmath12 electrons will occupy the @xmath17 orbitals , which split into one @xmath1 orbital and two degenerate @xmath2 orbital in the c - type af state .",
    "if the @xmath1 orbital is lower in energy , the system has to be metallic due to the degeneracy between the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 orbitals .",
    "however , if the @xmath3 is very large ( large than band width ) , it will try to reverse the energy level ordering of @xmath1 and @xmath52 states , in such a way that two @xmath2 orbitals are mostly occupied and @xmath1 becomes nearly empty , then the system gains energy from the possible gap opening between the occupied @xmath2 and unoccupied @xmath1 orbitals if @xmath3 is large .",
    "the above analysis for orbital polarization suggest that , no matter the system is ordered in the c - type or the a - type af states , the @xmath2 orbitals are always more favored than the @xmath1 orbital in the large @xmath3 limit . in such an orbital polarization , the elongation ( rather than compressive ) tetragonal distortion should be favored , in opposite to experimental observation . therefore , our calculations support the conclusion that the srcro@xmath0 is at least not strongly correlated system .",
    "furthermore , from above studies , we also learn that the metallicity of srcro@xmath0 in the c - type af state is protected by the degeneracy between the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 orbitals given the compressive tetragonal distortion observed . from the very good agreement between the optimized @xmath45 ratio from lda calculation ( c / a=0.990 ) and that observed experimentally ( c / a=0.992 ) ,",
    "we can further conclude that the effect of correlation is in fact very weak .",
    "in summary , we study the electronic structure and the magnetic property of srcro@xmath0 systematically based on the lda and lda+@xmath3 calculations . we analyze the various magnetic instabilities , the effect of lattice distortion , and the effect of correlation .",
    "the controversial issues , such as metal or insulator , cubic or tetragonal , can be now understood in a consistent picture .",
    "our calculated results are also quite consistent with available experiment results .",
    "we finally conclude that srcro@xmath0 is a weakly correlated af metal with small amount of orbital polarization .",
    "the magnetic instability rather than the orbital or lattice instabilities plays the dominant role in this compound .",
