    "it is well known from direct observations that the solar chromosphere and transition region are far from homogeneous ( see , for example , the uv images shown by reeves 1976 and gallagher et al .",
    "1998 ) . in spatially resolved observations of the sun",
    ", transition region line emission tends to be dominated by contributions from the network boundaries .",
    "the solar - stellar analogy tells us that a similar effect must be expected on the surfaces of other main - sequence stars .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to determine the filling factor of emitting material in solar - like stars and look for correlations with stellar parameters , such as has been done for surface ( photospheric ) magnetic filling factors by montesinos & jordan ( 1993 ) .",
    "such correlations may help to identify the physical processes which control coronal / chromospheric activity .",
    "the current generation of high resolution spectrographic instruments are providing spectra of unprecedented quality in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray wavelength ranges . unfortunately",
    ", such data can not provide direct information about the spatial distribution of emitting material in main - sequence star atmospheres since it is beyond the scope of current instruments to resolve dwarf star surfaces , with the exception of the sun .",
    "there is little prospect of overcoming this limitation in the near future .    in the absence of spatial information , semi - empirical modelling of main - sequence star spectra",
    "is effectively limited to the creation of `` mean '' 1-d atmospheric models whose parameters are those of a hypothetical homogeneous atmosphere which reproduces the observed spectrum ( e.g. the @xmath0  eri models constructed by kelch 1978 or sim 2002 ) .",
    "although such models are useful , tighter constraints on the true atmospheric parameters , and therefore the nature of the physical processes which operate , could be achieved if the distribution of emitting material were known .",
    "( information on the structure within the atmospheres of cool _ giant _ stars has been obtained through studies of molecular fluorescence , see mcmurry & jordan 2000 . )",
    "the approach which could be taken is illustrated by the work of cuntz et al .",
    "they have explored two - component chromospheres of k2  v stars , in which one component is heated by longitudinal tube waves and the other by acoustic waves .",
    "they simulate the supergranulation network using a flux tube model based on empirical correlations between observed surface magnetic fluxes and stellar rotation rates ( cuntz , ulmschneider & musielak , 1998 ) and calculate the flux in the ca  ii h and k lines expected from magnetoacoustic and acoustic waves . in the absence of observational constraints they use an average chromospheric network filling factor of 0.305 .",
    "thus a method which gives the filling factor in the transition region between the chromosphere and corona would provide valuable constraints on the above type of theoretical modelling .",
    "kopp ( 1972 ) discussed the energy balance in the solar transition region , in the light of early observations of the solar supergranulation structure .",
    "he introduced an area filling factor and by comparing emission measure distributions based on spatially integrated observations with the predictions of the energy balance equation he proposed that the transition region emission is restricted to an area of about 20  per cent of the solar surface area . in this case , the conductive flux in the mid - transition region is reduced and the lower transition region requires an additional source of heating .",
    "this type of structure was also explored by gabriel ( 1976 ) .",
    "the influence of the cross - section area and magnetic field expansion factor has also been recognized in the context of loop models of solar and stellar active regions ( see underwood , antiochos & vesecky 1981 ) .    a method of deriving area factors",
    "has also been discussed by jordan ( 2000 ) , in which the total pressure is not kept constant but is allowed to vary according to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "although philippides ( 1996 ) used this approach to estimate the filling factor at @xmath2  k in several main - sequence stars , the observational data available were not sufficient to find the variation of the filling factor with @xmath3 .",
    "here we apply the method to spatially unresolved stellar observations to derive , for the first time , the area filling factor as a function of @xmath3 in the upper transition region of @xmath0  eri .",
    "the star selected for this analysis , @xmath0  eri ( k2v ) , is a nearby dwarf that has moderately high levels of chromospheric / coronal activity and for which high quality spectroscopic data are available .",
    "this paper forms part of our study of the outer atmosphere of @xmath0  eri : see jordan et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , jordan et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , sim & jordan ( 2003 ) and sim ( 2003 , in preparation ) for details .    in the next section",
    "the theory required for the analysis is discussed .",
    "section  3 discusses the observations that are used to constrain the emission measure distribution ( section  4 ) .",
    "section  5 presents `` first - cut '' area filling factors deduced from the data and discusses possible sources of error . in section  6",
    ", a self - consistent determination of the filling factors is presented .",
    "the results are discussed in section  7 and conclusions are drawn in section  8 .",
    "spatially unresolved stellar observations can be used to constrain the apparent mean emission measure ( see pan & jordan 1995 ) distribution defined by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the electron temperature at radius @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron and hydrogen number densities respectively , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the photospheric stellar radius and @xmath11 at the stellar surface ) .",
    "the dilution factor @xmath12 specifies the fraction of photons ( emitted in an optically thin line at radial coordinate @xmath6 ) that escape the star uninterrupted by the stellar surface . for spherical geometry ,    @xmath13^{-1 } } } \\right ) \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the @xmath14 included in the notation for the emission measure in equation ( 1 ) is to remind the reader that the emission measure adopted is an integral over a logarithmic temperature range @xmath15  dex .",
    "this temperature range is chosen since it is the typical temperature range across which individual spectral lines form in the transition regions of cool stars .",
    "the area filling factor @xmath16 specifies the fraction of the total stellar surface area at radius @xmath6 ( @xmath17 ) which is occupied by emitting material .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how values for @xmath16 can be extracted from spatially unresolved data .    in the transition region where the pressure varies slowly as a function of the temperature , equation  ( 1 ) can be written approximately as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron and hydrogen pressures respectively , and are approximately constant over the region where an individual line is formed .",
    "the approximation that @xmath21 is constant in the region of line formation is less good , but is improved upon when finding final models by iteration .",
    "as discussed by jordan ( 2000 ) , it is possible to explain the complete radiation losses from the upper transition region in terms of the divergence of the net conductive energy flux from the overlying corona .",
    "the justification for this is that the emission lines are formed over a pressure - squared scale height @xmath22  km , whereas the main heating of the quiet corona occurs at much greater heights .",
    "it can not be ruled out that there is an additional source of heating in this part of the atmosphere , but it is certain that any additional heating must be small . the conductive flux can be expressed as    @xmath23    where @xmath24  ergs  @xmath25  s@xmath26  k@xmath27 at @xmath28  k ( spitzer 1956 ) . @xmath29 increases at lower temperature ( by about @xmath30 per cent by @xmath31  k ) , but it is taken as constant here for simplicity .",
    "building on the simpler plane parallel approximation used by jordan & brown ( 1981 ) , the logarithm of equation  ( 3 ) can be differentiated and the temperature gradient replaced by the conductive flux using equation  ( 4 ) . by assuming an energy balance between conduction and radiation , the net conductive flux can be replaced by the radiation losses and the following equation obtained :    @xmath32 = \\frac{\\mbox{d } \\log g(r)}{\\mbox{d } \\log t_{e } } + 2\\frac{\\mbox{d } \\log f(r)}{\\mbox{d } \\log t_{e } } \\\\",

    "@xmath34 is the total gas pressure .",
    "this equation can be solved numerically to obtain the distribution of @xmath35 as a function of @xmath5 . by comparison with values of @xmath36 ( deduced from observations ) this allows the area filling factor @xmath16 to be derived .",
    "the mean emission measure distribution can be constrained using observed emission line fluxes .",
    "the details of this procedure are well known and have been discussed previously by various authors ( e.g. jordan & brown 1981 , jordan et al .",
    "1987 ; griffiths & jordan 1998 ) .    in this paper , the mean emission measure distribution in the upper transition region of @xmath0  eri is constrained using the observed fluxes of emission lines of iron . for the most part ,",
    "the observed fluxes used are from the analysis performed by schmitt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using data recorded by the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) satellite .",
    "the data and line flux measurements are discussed by schmitt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and laming , drake & widing ( 1996 ) .",
    "schmitt et al . ( 1996 ) give fluxes for fe lines from ionisation stages ix  xvi and xviii  xxi .",
    "for the current work , only one line from each ionisation stage detected in the _ euve _ data is used . for",
    "fe  xii the three lines at around 193     have been added to give the total flux in the @xmath37s @xmath37p multiplet . in other cases where there are several lines from the same ion reported by schmitt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the strongest line has generally been used .",
    "the lines used are listed in table  1 together with the percentage errors in the measured fluxes given by schmitt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath38 rest wavelength .",
    "given that there are several sources of systematic error , the agreement between the form of @xmath39 used in the modelling and the values of @xmath39 predicted by the model is sufficiently good that the higher pressure model can be regarded as self - consistent if the arnaud & raymond ( 1992 ) ionisation balance is adopted .",
    "it is noteworthy that the largest discrepancies are for fe  ix , fe  xv and , in particular , fe  xvi which are the ions that show the largest uncertainties in the ionisation balance .",
    "the area factors deduced from the model with lower pressure are slightly less self - consistent than those obtained from the higher pressure model , being systematically larger than those assumed in the modelling . given the scale of the other sources of error , however , the agreement is adequate .    comparing tables  2 and 4 , it is clear that the main effect of including the term describing the variation of the area factor with temperature is to reduce the implied area factors for most of the high temperature lines , leading to fewer unphysical ( @xmath40 ) values .",
    "this is the result of the steeper increase of emission measure with temperature .",
    "the only exception is fe  xvi for which the implied area factor is _ larger _ when the variation of the area factor is included in the model if the arnaud & raymond ( 1992 ) ionisation fractions are used .",
    "this is because fe  xvi forms at temperatures above the peak of the emission measure distribution , if the arnaud & raymond ( 1992 ) ionisation balance calculations are adopted .    in summary",
    ", the self - consistent treatment of the variation of the area factor presented in this section indicates that neglecting this variation in the modelling may cause the area factors in the upper transition region to be systematically overestimated to a small , but significant , extent .",
    "accounting for the variation of the area factors does not , however , alter the apparent trend that the area factor increases across the upper transition region .",
    "for now it is concluded that the area factors presented in table  4 ( or equivalently described by equation 10 ) are the best current estimates of the area filling factors in the upper transition region of @xmath0  eri and that most of them are accurate to within a factor of two .",
    "in sections 5 and 6 it has been shown that the theory described in section 2 can be used to provide estimates of the area filling factors of emitting material at various temperatures in stellar transition regions .",
    "the results show ( fig .",
    "5 ) that in @xmath0  eri the area filling factor increases with temperature markedly in the upper transition region , from @xmath41 at @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the corona .",
    "there is no evidence for significant variations across the mid - transition region @xmath44 .",
    "the variation of the area factor derived for @xmath0  eri is similar to that found from observations of the solar supergranulation network made with the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) ( gallagher et al .",
    "they find ( see their figs . 5 and 8 , in particular ) that at the resolution of the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) ( @xmath45 2  arcsec by 2  arcsec ) the area occupied by the emitting material increases dramatically in the upper transition , but does not vary significantly across the mid - transition region",
    ". these results are in general agreement with earlier observations and the model by gabriel ( 1976 ) . when the method used here is applied to cds observations of the average network , a filling factor of @xmath45 0.2 at @xmath46  k",
    "is deduced _ within _ the network ( smith & jordan 2002 ) , which typically occupies @xmath45 50 per cent of the solar area at this temperature ( gallagher et al .",
    "the filling factors which we have derived are based on the assumption that the observed emission is dominated by the regions occupying the small areas",
    ". these could refer to structures within the supergranulation network of @xmath0  eri and may not be comparable to the total solar network area observed with the resolution of cds . in this case ,",
    "the area factors are _ larger _ than those found for the sun .    using the solar analogy , the area factor found at @xmath46  k can be applied to the lower transition region .",
    "this increases the intrinsic radiation losses and since thermal conduction now plays no role below @xmath47  k , an additional source of heating is required .",
    "as found by sim & jordan ( 2003 ) , _ if _ the observed non - thermal emission line widths are associated with an alfvn wave ( or fast - mode wave ) flux , there is ample energy to heat both the corona and the lower transition region , although uncertainties concerning wave propagation and dissipation remain to be resolved .",
    "the filling factor of @xmath48 found for the mid - transition region of epsilon eri can be compared with the value of 0.3 assumed for the chromosphere by cuntz et al .",
    "since the filling factor of magnetic flux tubes should increase with height , our results suggest that a smaller chromospheric filling factor of @xmath49 would be more appropriate ; this could be explored in future two - component models .",
    "the accuracy of the results presented in this paper is limited by the various systematic sources of error which were discussed in section 5.3 .",
    "in particular the analysis of larger sets of lines , ideally covering a wide range of elements and ionisation species would help .",
    "this would reduce the systematic errors associated with uncertainties in the ionisation fractions for iron and possibly help to identify possible errors arising from the adopted elemental abundance .",
    "suitable data for such analysis are gradually becoming available for a range of stars thanks to the current generation of x - ray satellite missions .",
    "x - ray data are also advantageous since their analysis is less sensitive to the assumed interstellar hydrogen column density .",
    "improved calculations of atomic data for iron , and the radiation loss function @xmath50 would also make the modelling more quantitatively reliable .    in future work",
    "this technique should be applied to a range of late - type stars with differing levels of activity . by doing",
    "so it should be possible to look for trends in the behaviour of the filling factors of emitting material with various stellar parameters . the ability to reproduce these trends",
    "will then be a new constraint on theoretical studies of the structure and heating of late - type stars , including the magnetic field geometry .",
    "it has been shown that by assuming an energy balance between radiation and thermal conduction in the upper transition region , it is possible to use spatially unresolved stellar observations to estimate the fractional area filling factor of emitting material in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the technique has been applied to @xmath0  eri and it has been found that the area filling factor is @xmath41 in the mid transition region and that it increases to @xmath43 in the corona .",
    "these filling factors are similar to those found from observations of the solar transition region , and from models in which the transition region consists of material in magnetic funnels whose radii are greatest is in the upper transition region / corona .",
    "several potential sources of uncertainty in the calculations have been discussed and it is concluded that , although they are currently significant , they do not prevent a useful application of the methods adopted .",
    "further observations and calculations of atomic data should be able to reduce the current uncertainties .",
