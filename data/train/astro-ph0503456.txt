    "in 1977 , shu presented seminal work in the theory of low - mass , isolated star formation ( * ? ? ? * hereafter shu77 ) .",
    "he presented the idea that stars could form from inside - out collapse .",
    "this model is still important today because it is simple , yet it predicts so many observables in the process of star formation .",
    "it prescribes the evolution of inflow , the velocity structure of the envelope , and the particular shape of the envelope s density distribution .",
    "@xcite found that the inside - out collapse model fit millimeter observations of protostars in taurus and various bok globules .",
    "however , these authors also found class 0 sources in perseus , a less quiescent region of star formation , that had central densities and accretion rates that were too high to be accounted for by the shu77 model .",
    "molecular line observations have also been used to compare the predicted densities and velocities with the actual conditions in star - forming cores . @xcite and @xcite",
    "presented evidence that the envelopes of some protostars are undergoing inside - out collapse .",
    "others have presented evidence against inside - out collapse .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that l1544 , a starless core , exhibits infall motions across the entire core .",
    "nonetheless , it is still not clear whether the shu77 inside - out collapse scenario or its variants can be ruled out .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the observational signatures of a star , which is forming through inside - out collapse , so that astronomers can test this theory in a well - defined way . the most relevant aspects of the shu77 inside - out collapse model are a constant accretion rate of material from the envelope onto the star+disk system and an envelope density that is initially described by a singular , isothermal sphere ( sis ) .    the constant accretion rate in this model has given rise to the so - called `` luminosity problem '' : the luminosities that result when material accretes onto a central object with a small radius and increasing mass exceed those seen for most young , low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the presence of a disk can help by increasing the accretion radius and acting as a reservoir where matter is stored and then episodically accreted .",
    "however , a disk does not completely eliminate the `` luminosity problem '' in these models",
    ".    a constant accretion rate in star - forming cores should be evident when comparing populations in the different stages of star formation .",
    "the transition from class 0 to class i object is thought to occur when the mass of the star and disk is equal to the envelope mass .",
    "therefore , we should observe equal numbers of class 0 and i objects if they form with constant accretion rates .",
    "@xcite found about a 10:1 ratio for class i and 0 sources in ophiuchus , suggesting the class 0 stage is very short .",
    "however , @xcite , in an unbiased survey of dark clouds , found a 1:1 ratio .",
    "these authors suggested that ophiuchus has experienced a burst of star formation in the past , resulting in the 10:1 ratio .",
    "future and ongoing surveys of nearby star - forming regions will certainly offer more information regarding the relative populations of class 0 and class i sources @xcite .",
    "the initial density configuration for the shu77 model is that of a sis , which has @xmath2 .",
    "one - dimensional modelling of the submillimeter emission from starless cores has shown that their density distributions are well - fitted by bonnor - ebert spheres , but power - law density profiles are not conclusively ruled out @xcite . indeed , some starless cores have a density structure that seems to be approaching the sis .",
    "for example , three - dimensional modelling of l1544 shows a power - law density distribution with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "other studies of the density distribution in more evolved star - forming cores were unable to rule out the shu77 predictions @xcite ; in fact , one - third of the sources in @xcite were well - fitted by the inside - out collapse model .",
    "for this paper , we assume that starless cores must evolve into an sis . at this point , collapse ensues , and we begin modeling the evolution of the protostar .",
    "this work has been expanded by @xcite to model the chemical evolution of these star - forming cores .",
    "other authors have predicted the observed signatures of a forming star .",
    "@xcite , hereafter m98 , developed a framework on which to calculate various signatures of star formation .",
    "our work has been prompted by their efforts .",
    "however , the methods and models employed in this work are quite different from those of m98 ; as a result , our conclusions are different .",
    "we discuss these differences in this paper .    because these models are 1-dimensional",
    ", we do not consider the role of outflows , flattened envelopes , or asymmetric disks ; therefore , we probably underestimate the amount of short - wavelength radiation .",
    "* hereafter w03 ) have included some of these complications .",
    "however , w03 did not create a consistent evolutionary model but , instead , considered `` typical '' protostellar objects of different observational classes .",
    "fortunately , these authors were able to explore the impact of 3-dimensional effects , which we are unable to model . in this way",
    ", we consider this effort to be complementary to the work of w03 and compare our results to theirs .",
    "the advent of large surveys such as 2mass and the spitzer space telescope s legacy programs @xcite provide vast sets of data through which theories of star formation may be vigorously tested . in this work ,",
    "we hope to provide some tangible means to study the validity of the inside - out collapse model in the role of forming stars .",
    "first , we define the framework through which we have created this evolutionary sequence . in this section , we discuss what has been assumed for the dust opacity , interstellar radiation field , envelope structure and dynamics , and the evolution of the star and disk components of the system .",
    "@xcite showed that , for starless cores , the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) significantly affects both the total observed luminosity and the shape of the observed submillimeter intensity profile ; even objects with a luminous , internal source might attribute most of their luminosity to the isrf @xcite .",
    "@xcite scaled the isrf by a constant , but we have used the opacity of @xcite dust to attenuate the isrf with @xmath3 ( see figure 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "this method simulates the effects of low density material in the environs of a star - forming core .",
    "these authors @xcite also found that the multi - wavelength observations were best matched by using the opacities of the dust modeled by @xcite .",
    "in particular , they concluded that `` oh5 '' dust , found in the fifth column of table 1 in @xcite , was optimal for star - forming cores .",
    "unfortunately , the modeled data for oh5 dust does not include wavelengths shortward of 1.25 @xmath4 m .",
    "@xcite calculated only the values for the dust opacity ( @xmath5 ) and not the scattering and absorption cross - sections ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) as needed by dusty , the radiative transfer program we have used @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have obtained data from @xcite , which includes the scattering and absorption cross - sections for wavelengths as short as 0.091 @xmath4 m . in figure  [ kappa ]",
    ", we show the opacities for oh5 dust and the opacity calculated by @xcite for dust grains with a radius of 0.1 @xmath4 m at a temperature of 10 k ( hereafter , p1 dust ) ; we have assumed a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 and give the opacity of the gas in this figure . at short wavelengths ,",
    "these two types of opacities are in fairly good agreement ; unless @xmath8 is low , however , the short - wavelength opacity is not relevant .",
    "we used the opacity given for oh5 and @xmath7 for the p1 dust to calculate the absorption coefficient for the oh5 dust .",
    "further , we used the albedo values given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4b ) to apportion the opacity due to scattering and absorption from the 3 @xmath4 m ice feature .",
    "finally , we have extrapolated the cross - sections out to 3.6 cm , as required by dusty . for @xmath7 ,",
    "we extrapolate by a @xmath9 power - law as expected for rayleigh scattering .",
    "we fit the last several data points of the oh5 absorption coefficients to determine the @xmath10 power - law used to extrapolate @xmath6 out to @xmath11 cm .",
    "we show the scattering and absorption coefficients in figure  [ kappa ] .      for the density structure in the envelope",
    ", we adopt the inside - out collapse scenario @xcite .",
    "this model begins with an sis with a density distribution that is proportional to @xmath12 . through some perturbation",
    ", collapse begins inside the cloud and proceeds outward . as collapse ensues , the cloud s density distribution can be approximately described by a broken power law : the inner collapsing portion , @xmath13 ( indicative of freefall ) , and the outer static envelope , @xmath14 .",
    "however , there is a transition region just within the infall radius where the density profile is significantly flatter than the @xmath15 power law .",
    "therefore , we use the actual solutions to equations 11 and 12 in @xcite .",
    "when the infall radius exceeds the outer radius , the shu77 solution is no longer valid .",
    "therefore , we adopt a density profile with @xmath16 and let the mass of the envelope ( and , hence , the fiducial density ) decrease as mass is accreted onto the protostar and disk .",
    "the total amount of mass is constrained by the effective sound speed ( @xmath17 ) and the envelope s outer radius ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the models presented herein all begin with cores whose initial masses are different .",
    "we calculate this mass from the following expression : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath17 is the effective sound speed , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath23 is the isothermal temperature , @xmath4 is the mean molecular mass ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is the mass of the hydrogen atom ( @xmath26 g ) and @xmath27 is the turbulent velocity ( 1/e doppler width ) .",
    "we choose @xmath28 k and the value for @xmath27 such that the turbulent contribution to the sound speed is equal to the thermal component ( @xmath29 km s@xmath30 ) ; @xmath31 km s@xmath30 .",
    "we calculate the total envelope mass as follows , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath18 are the inner and outer radii of the envelope . in this paper , radii pertaining to the envelope are denoted by the lower - case `` r '' ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath18 ) while the radii of the star and disk are denoted by the upper - case `` @xmath35 '' ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "even though the shu77 model has no specific mass scale , we assume that the model is applicable to the formation of stars with different masses . in order to define the mass of the core",
    ", we truncate the outer radius of the envelope , using equation  [ eqn - menv ] .",
    "such truncated envelopes are not unheard of ; @xcite found evidence for truncated outer radii for cores in ophiuchus . in this paper , we consider cores with three initial masses : 0.3 , 1.0 , and 3.0 m@xmath39 . with our assumed sound speed ,",
    "these masses correspond to outer radii of 1767 , 5889 , and 17667 au .",
    "we end our modeling when all envelope material has accreted onto the star - disk system . in these three scenarios ,",
    "this event occurs at 62500 , 210000 , and 625000 years , respectively .",
    "the time for collapse varies significantly among the three models , but this variation is inherent within the inside - out collapse model , assuming similar initial conditions . with constant and identical accretion rates ,",
    "lower - mass objects simply form more quickly than higher - mass objects .",
    "we show the mass evolution for each of these cases in figure  [ mass ] .",
    "it is not clear whether this model is realistic for cores with masses as low as 0.3 m@xmath39 .",
    "the jean s mass for a core with @xmath28 k and density of @xmath40 @xmath41 is @xmath420.6 m@xmath39 ( @xmath43m@xmath44 ) . however , if the cloud is cooler , it could be unstable to collapse ( e.g. , if @xmath45 k and @xmath46 , @xmath47 m@xmath39 ) .",
    "in fact , much smaller mass cores can be created through turbulent fragmentation @xcite , so the 0.3 m@xmath39 is probably not so absurd . considering that some evolved protostars",
    "are thought to be substellar @xcite , we must consider how these objects are formed .",
    "defining the envelope s inner radius is an issue .",
    "one choice is that the envelope s inner radius could be equal to the outer radius of the disk .",
    "however , this disk radius , which is defined as the centrifugal radius ( section  [ sxn - diskradius ] ) , is very small at early times . with a small inner radius ,",
    "the density in the inner region is unrealistically large ( e.g. , @xmath48 @xmath41 ) .",
    "these dense regions cause the opacity to become very high .",
    "further , a rotating envelope becomes flattened and aspherical at these small radii @xcite , so a spherical model is not appropriate to these regions .",
    "therefore , we set a maximum value for @xmath49 @xmath4 m ) and calculate the inner radius of the sis ( at @xmath50 ) so that @xmath51 m ) is equal to @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 ^{-1}\\ ] ] we choose @xmath54 and discuss the impact of varying this in section  [ sxn_tau_max ] .",
    "the envelope s inner radius follows this formula until it is exceeded by the disk radius . for the three cores , the envelope s inner radius is 100 au at the end of collapse ( see section  [ sxn - diskradius ] ) .",
    "we define the infall rate for the case of a non - magnetic , centrally peaked envelope density distribution as described in the @xcite scenario .",
    "the rate of constant accretion is calculated as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a dimensionless constant of order unity . since @xmath31 km s@xmath30 ,",
    "the accretion rate , @xmath57 , is @xmath58 m@xmath39 yr@xmath30 .",
    "we adopt the prescription of @xcite for the infall rate onto the disk and star .",
    "these authors assume that all mass is accreted onto either the disk or star such that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the accretion rate of envelope material directly onto the star and @xmath61 is the accretion rate onto the disk .",
    "these values are calculated as follows : @xmath62,\\\\ \\dot{m}_d&=&\\dot{m}(1-u_\\ast)^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the ratio of the star and disk radii , @xmath64 .",
    "in almost all cases , @xmath63 becomes very small in a short time and , hence , @xmath60 also approaches zero .",
    "however , material also accretes from the disk onto the star ; this process is not included in these equations .",
    "@xcite defined an efficiency factor@xmath65 , the fraction of material in the disk that will accrete onto the star  so that the star could gain mass and be a source of accretion luminosity .",
    "we discuss the implementation of this accretion process in the next section .",
    "evidence in the form of near- and mid - infrared @xcite and millimeter @xcite observations of disks surrounding stellar and substellar objects has recently become more convincing . also , the inclusion of a disk in various models has a significant effect on the interpretations of those models .",
    "therefore , to not include a disk in this evolutionary scheme is wholly unrealistic .",
    "we adopt the disk model developed , in theory , by @xcite , and , in practice , by @xcite .",
    "the density distribution for the dust and gas ( assuming homogeneous mixing ) is defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the surface density ( in gm/@xmath68 ) at @xmath69 , a fiducial radius . we choose @xmath70 in accordance with the density structure for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the mass of the disk , given this power law distribution is given by : @xmath71 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath69 are the inner , outer , and fiducial radii of the disk .",
    "the inner radius of the disk is the dust destruction radius defined as : @xmath72 where we define the dust destruction temperature , @xmath73 k , and @xmath74 is the luminosity of the star .    for the disk outer radius , @xmath38 , we adopt the centrifugal radius that evolves with time as follows @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the time and @xmath77 is the angular velocity of the cloud prior to collapse ; other variables are as already defined .",
    "@xmath77 so that , at the end of the class i stage , the disk radius is 100 au .",
    "these angular velocities are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 s@xmath30 for the 3 , 1 , and 0.3 m@xmath39 models , respectively .",
    "@xcite found a range for @xmath77 from @xmath81 to @xmath82 s@xmath30 .",
    "the upper end of this range is about one - third of @xmath77 for the 0.3 m@xmath39 model , but the least massive of the cores in @xcite was 0.6 m@xmath39 .",
    "we assume that less massive and smaller cores have higher angular velocities .",
    "we evolve the mass of the disk via the expression given by @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the time when @xmath85 ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath87 .",
    "further , @xcite defines @xmath88 as follows : @xmath89 we evaluate this expression numerically as suggested by @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath90 is the total mass accreted ( i.e. @xmath91 ) . @xcite",
    "give @xmath65 as a free parameter ; @xmath65 is the fraction of material accreted onto the disk that will eventually accrete onto the star . to determine a value for @xmath65",
    ", we assume that the ratio of star to disk mass must be @xmath92 , which is in accord with theoretical work @xcite . in figure",
    "[ mratio ] , we show this ratio for several values of @xmath65 .",
    "we choose @xmath93 so that @xmath94 for the 1 m@xmath39 model .",
    "we apply the same criterion for the 0.3 and 3 m@xmath39 models and set @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . in section  [ sxn - parameters ] , we explore the effects of allowing it to vary .",
    "the temperature distribution for the disk is defined by the following , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the temperature at the fiducial radius , @xmath69 .",
    "we set @xmath99 , a temperature distribution that decreases more slowly with radius than expected for a flat disk , to simulate flaring and disk accretion @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the disk has several components as given by @xcite .",
    "first , envelope material falling onto the disk will act as a source of luminosity .",
    "then , there is a source of `` mixing luminosity '' that arises , basically , from the mixing of newly accreted material and that material already in orbit around the star .",
    "finally , @xcite assumed that some fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the disk material will frictionally dissipate its remaining orbital energy and fall onto the star .",
    "@xcite give the expression for @xmath100 in equation 33b of their work ; we use this equation for @xmath100 , which includes all three of these components , in the evolutionary model .",
    "as the disk radius grows larger with time and @xmath101 , their expression for @xmath100 simplifies to @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103      for the star , we define several parameters : mass ( @xmath104 ) , luminosity ( @xmath74 ) , radius ( @xmath36 ) , and effective temperature ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "each of these quantities evolve over time , and they are generally interdependent .      for the stellar mass ,",
    "we subtract the disk mass from the total accreted mass as in @xcite : @xmath106m.\\ ] ] all variables are as previously defined . included in this equation are two means by which the star gains mass .",
    "material accretes directly from the envelope onto the star until the disk grows in size and accretes most of the infalling envelope mass .",
    "then , the star mostly gains material that has accreted onto and is processed through the disk .",
    "the luminosity of the star has two components : that arising from accretion ( @xmath107 ) , the dominant source of luminosity at early times , and the luminosity due to gravitational contraction and deuterium burning ( @xmath108 ) . simply , @xmath109 .    @xcite calculate the accretion luminosity from material accreting onto the star .",
    "their calculations include the luminosity from material that falls onto the star and the energy released due to differential rotation of the protostar .",
    "@xcite give an expression for @xmath110 in equation 33a of their work ; we use this prescription for l@xmath111 .",
    "as the disk radius grows larger with time and @xmath112 , this simplifies to @xcite @xmath113    @xcite define @xmath114 as an `` efficiency factor '' that dictates how the star dissipates the energy due to differential rotation . @xcite",
    "considered this value to be a free parameter but chose @xmath115 for their standard model , which we use as well . in section  [ sxn - parameters ] , we discuss the effects of varying @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath108 was calculated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dm ) .",
    "we have made linear fits to their pre - main sequence tracks with opacities from @xcite ( tables 1 and 5 of dm ) .",
    "first , we have fit a power - law in the luminosity - time plane for each stellar mass given by dm .",
    "for masses less than 0.2 m@xmath39 , where a single power - law is not appropriate , we have fit two - piece power - laws to dm s data . for times",
    "earlier than those covered by dm s tracks , we have assumed a power - law expression : @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the earliest time in the calculations by dm , and @xmath118 is the luminosity of the pre - main sequence star at time @xmath117 .",
    "this equation is ad hoc and meant to smoothly bridge the transition from where there is no data for l@xmath119 to the point where dm s evolutionary tracks begin . finally , to obtain the appropriate value for @xmath108 , we linearly interpolate between masses for a given time in the star s evolution .",
    "as noted in m98 , the beginning of infall and accretion luminosity is not the same time as that for the onset of the luminosity represented by @xmath108 .",
    "we adopt , as m98 did , a difference in these two timescales of @xmath120 years such that , for @xmath121 , we take @xmath122 yr for particular values of @xmath123 as given by dm ; this assumption is based on the theoretical work of @xcite .",
    "after collapse begins , the forming star must wait @xmath120 years before the luminosity due to contraction and deuterium burning ( as described by dm ) will begin .",
    "further , the luminosity from dm s models does not become significant until @xmath124 years .",
    "therefore , @xmath108 is not relevant until @xmath125 years , which is greater than the time required for the 0.3 m@xmath39 to collapse and only @xmath126 years more than the collapse time for the 1 m@xmath39 core .    with this final term",
    ", the total luminosity of the protostellar system is now made of three components : @xmath107 , the luminosity due to accretion and differential rotation of the protostar ; @xmath108 , the luminosity arising from gravitational contraction and deuterium burning in the protostar , and @xmath100 , the luminosity from accretion onto the disk and dissipation of the orbital energy within the disk .",
    "in addition , there is the luminosity that results from the isrf , @xmath127 .",
    "we calculated @xmath127 by illuminating a core that has no internal source .",
    "however , the core does have an evolving density distribution identical to the three mass scenarios presented herein .",
    "then , we calculate the luminosity that results from the dust grains , which are heated externally . at early times , the external radiation field contributes most of the luminosity .",
    "as the envelope mass decreases and the internal source luminosity grows , @xmath127 becomes insignificant .",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath127 in figure  [ lisrf ] .    in conclusion ,",

    "we allow the radius of the star to evolve as suggested by ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , the time at which to apply these calculations is not so clear .    in the evolution of a protostar , the early years are occupied by the first hydrostatic core .",
    "while not yet clearly observed , the first hydrostatic core has been predicted @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded , based on some simple arguments , that the lifetime of this stage should be short , only about 20,000 years .",
    "further , @xcite have determined that the average radius of this core should be about 5 au .",

    "there are consequences for including this large radius at early times . because the centrifugal radius is very small and , hence",
    ", the disk has not formed , the luminosity at these early times is derived wholly from spherical accretion onto the central source .",

    "the accretion luminosity rises quickly because there is no disk and material is accreting directly onto the star . at about @xmath134 years",
    ", the centrifugal radius has increased so that a disk can form .",
    "then , the accreting material is processed by the disk causing @xmath107 , which arises from accretion onto the star , to decrease .    in summary ,",

    "of course , we do not observe strong near - infrared radiation from starless cores . at short wavelengths , these dust grains preferentially forward scatter light , so neglecting the anisotropic nature of the scattering causes this unrealistic flux in the near - infrared .",

    "however , for those models with @xmath160 , the evolution of @xmath0 begins to converge . finally ,",

    "with these free parameters set to the given values , we have run models with different initial masses : 0.3 , 1.0 , and 3.0 m@xmath39 .",
    "then , we have calculated the various observational signatures .",
    "the bolometric temperature and the ratio of bolometric to submillimeter luminosity have emerged , in the past decade , as the two primary methods of classifying protostars . because @xmath0 is a measure of the flux - weighted mean frequency of the protostar s sed , it is highly affected by the emergence of any short - wavelength radiation .",
    "the ratio of the bolometric to submillimeter luminosity , on the other hand , is virtually unaffected by the short - wavelength emission .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is less susceptible to the effects of geometry , which can cause more or less nir radiation to be observed .",
    "this ratio is a rough measure of the ratio of protostellar mass ( including the disk and star ) to the envelope mass .    in figure",

    "each of the evolutionary indicators increase drastically at about @xmath165 years , when the fhc contracts .",
    "all of the envelope material has accreted onto the star and disk by @xmath166 years , shortly after the central star has contracted from the fhc stage . therefore ,",
    "as the central star becomes hotter and more luminous , there is little material left in the envelope",
    ". then , @xmath0 increases because more short - wavelength radiation is observed , and @xmath1 increases because @xmath167 as the envelope goes away .",
    "if this model is correct , these low - mass stars should proceed through the fhc stage and , almost immediately , be seen as class ii objects .",
    "the 1.0 and 3.0 m@xmath39 objects track one another fairly well , up to @xmath120 years , in the @xmath0 plot ( figure  [ tbol_lsmm_mass ] ) despite the fact that they form on different timescales .",
    "the 1.0 @xmath148 core requires @xmath168 years for all envelope mass to accrete while the 3.0 @xmath148 core requires @xmath169 years .",
    "however , both cores evolve from class 0 to class i at about 50,000 years , which is about @xmath170 and @xmath171 of the total infall time for the 1.0 and 3.0 m@xmath39 cores , respectively .",
    "this transition from class 0 to i is partly due to the sudden `` turning on '' of the central source as it contracts to @xmath172 r@xmath39 , and accretion luminosity becomes relevant .",
    "there is , however , another reason for this sudden transition .",
    "as shown in figure  [ tau ] , the shu77 model exhibits a drastic decrease in @xmath8 regardless of the adopted value for @xmath52 .",
    "initially , the envelope is described by @xmath173 , but , as collapse ensues , it changes to @xmath15 and @xmath8 drops . because @xmath8 is so low , any substantial source of stellar luminosity will cause observable short - wavelength radiation to emerge from the system .",
    "these details are actually quite important if one uses these evolutionary signatures to derive relative lifetimes of the various classes as has been done in the past .",
    "if one calculates the bolometric temperature for a group of protostars ( whose seds have been well sampled ) , there should be very few class 0 cores ",
    "conservatively , about 1/10 to 1/4 of the class i population , but most likely a much smaller fraction .",
    "@xcite presented their efforts to do such a study ; they found approximately equal numbers of class 0 and i objects .",
    "however , their data only included the far - infrared ( iras ) and submillimeter fluxes .",
    "analysis of the mid- and near - infrared data from the spitzer legacy and 2mass surveys along with far - infrared and millimeter observations will almost certainly produce different results . with more complete sampling of the protostars seds ,",
    "very few class 0 cores , by the @xmath0 criterion , should remain if this picture of evolution is correct .",
    "finally , in the plot of @xmath0 , the 0.3 , 1.0 , and 3.0 m@xmath39 data exhibit a `` kink '' at about @xmath174 , @xmath120 , and @xmath175 years , respectively .",
    "this is the point where the envelope s density distribution is described by a power - law , @xmath176 , instead of the shu77 solution .",
    "the power - law distribution has a slightly higher @xmath8 that causes less short - wavelength radiation to be observed . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0 decreases slightly at this point of transition , but this is an artifact of the model .",
    "the ratio of bolometric to submillimeter luminosity seems to be much more consistent in describing the evolution of these protostars . adopting @xmath177 as the dividing line for class 0 and i cores , we find that the 1 and 3 m@xmath39 protostars become class i objects after @xmath178 and @xmath179 years , respectively .",
    "these times correspond to slightly more than 1/2 of the total infall time for each core whereas the @xmath0 criterion showed that the cores became class i after 1/4 and 1/10 of their total infall times .",
    "finally , in figure  [ tbol_lsmm ] , we show a plot of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the three models .",
    "the points represent data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in general , these models are consistent with the data . however , the 11 starless cores in the lower left - hand section of this plot show higher @xmath1 than the model predicts .",
    "the definition of @xmath1 includes data longward of 350 @xmath4 m , but , for all of these cores , no 350 @xmath4 m data exist .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath145 is lower than that which is modeled .",
    "second , there is little near- or mid - infrared data available for many of the sources represented . with future observations ,",
    "the bolometric temperature will almost certainly increase .",
    "for example , we consider the 1 m@xmath39 model and calculate @xmath0 by including different fluxes .",
    "if we use iras fluxes only , @xmath180 k for the core at 5@xmath181 years while @xmath0 , calculated with just the spitzer bands , is 92 k. at @xmath182 years , @xmath0 is 88 and 151 k as measured with the iras and spitzer fluxes , respectively .",
    "we can look at classification from a different , more physical , perspective . in figure  [ mratio_env ]",
    ", we plot the ratio of the stellar and disk mass to the envelope mass .",
    "physically , we might consider a protostar to move from class 0 to class i when this ratio is 1 and there are equal amounts of mass in the protostellar system and the envelope surrounding this star+disk .",
    "this event occurs at @xmath183 , 1.05@xmath184 , and 3.1@xmath184 years for the 0.3 , 1.0 , and 3.0 m@xmath39 cores .",
    "of course , as defined by shu77 , this is also the time when the infall radius is equal to the outer radius .    in figure",
    "[ tbol_lsmm_mratio ] , we plot @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath185 . in the @xmath0 plot ,",
    "the 1 and 3 m@xmath39 cores change from class 0 to class i while @xmath186 . with the presently defined boundaries",
    ", the bolometric temperature does not appropriately classify the stages of star formation . only the 0.3 m@xmath39 core changes from class 0",
    "to i when @xmath187 as is appropriate for our understanding of these stages .",
    "however , with the @xmath1 criterion , we find that the cross - over from class 0 to i occurs approximately when @xmath188 , which is a more realistic view of these evolutionary stages . indeed",
    ", this observational signature is also favored because it is not largely dependent on what is observed at short wavelengths where geometric effects play a big role @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set some physical divisions for the evolutionary transitions . first , we let the ppc / class 0 transition occur when the fhc first collapses at @xmath189 years . for all three cores ,",
    "this occurs when @xmath190 .",
    "for the class 0/i transition , we let @xmath191 ; @xmath192 when this criterion is met .",
    "notice that this value is slightly less than the requirement given by @xcite , i.e. @xmath177 . the class ii stage begins when all of the envelope material has been accreted .",
    "our models are not reliable at these late times , and the @xmath1 signature is not a very good indicator for this stage of evolution .",
    "nonetheless , we find that @xmath1 is approximately 2000 at this point , but this value is dependent on the adopted model for the disk .      in figure  [ blt ] , we show a plot of the bolometric luminosity and temperature , which m98 called a blt diagram .",
    "the axes are laid out to mimic the hertzsprung - russell diagram with @xmath0 increasing right to left . in figure",
    "[ blt ] , we have included m98 s models from figure 7 in their paper .",
    "two of the thin lines in figure  [ blt ] are their models for forming , 0.5 m@xmath39 protostars whose initial envelope masses were 1 and 3 m@xmath39 .",
    "we also show their 0.3 m@xmath39 model from figure 9 , but we label it here as 1.8 m@xmath39 because this is the mass of the envelope before collapse begins while 0.3 m@xmath39 is the mass of the star at t=@xmath146 .",
    "we also plot data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as crosses ; the dots represent data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our tracks are markedly different from any of those presented in m98 , so a summary of the differences between two models is relevant here .",
    "primarily , our methods differ in that m98 attempts to create a reasonable model that fits the data while we are simply determining the observational signatures of the shu77 model .    the most significant difference between this work and that of m98 is the assumptions for infall evolution .",
    "m98 described the infall and accretion with an exponential decay function such that the accretion rates began at about @xmath193 m@xmath39 yr@xmath30 and , as the star approached the main sequence , finished with @xmath194 m@xmath39 yr@xmath30 .",
    "we assume constant accretion onto the star+disk system throughout the duration of the life of the envelope as predicted by the shu77 collapse solution .",
    "however , in our model , the rate of accretion onto the star s surface does decrease with time as the disk forms and takes a more prominent role in processing material from the envelope to the star . also , the modeled evolution is longer for m98 ( @xmath40 years ) than in our model ( @xmath195 years ) .",
    "these different assumptions about infall have several implications .",
    "first , in our model , we form a more massive star from similar initial conditions in less time . for our 3 m@xmath39 core ,",
    "the star reaches 0.5 m@xmath39 at @xmath196 years . on the other hand ,",
    "m98 s models require , by design , about @xmath40 years to create this 0.5 m@xmath39 star from a 3 m@xmath39 core .",
    "of course , at the end of @xmath40 years , the star created by m98 has completed its pre - main - sequence evolution , while our model still requires time to completely accrete the disk material .",
    "this discrepancy in the star s final mass presents another difference between this work and that of m98 .",
    "m98 included a dispersal timescale for the envelope that included an assumption of mass loss due to outflow from the central protostar .",
    "we do not include outflows in any way in these models .",
    "the lack of outflows in this work has two implications : 1 ) the mass evolution , as depicted in figure  [ mass ] , is incomplete and 2 ) we do not consider the effects of an evacuated outflow cavity .",
    "fortunately , the mass evolution is not considerably altered by the exclusion of outflows .",
    "@xcite found that the ratio of mass loss rate to mass accretion rate is @xmath197 .",
    "we are unable to model the scattered light coming from the outflow cavity .",
    "others have , however , and we discuss their work in section  [ sxn - whitney ]",
    ".    m98 also assume the envelope to have a density profile with a free - falling structure , @xmath176 .",
    "we use the shu77 solution , which has an inner free - falling envelope surrounded by a static envelope with @xmath2 .",
    "these differences in structure of the envelope cause great disparities in the opacity .",
    "for example , a core that has 0.8 m@xmath39 of material with @xmath176 creates @xmath198 . a core with the same amount of material but described by the shu77 collapse solution , with an infall radius that is one - half of the outer radius , creates @xmath199 .",
    "such a disparity causes large changes in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , if we place a 0.7 l@xmath39 star with t@xmath200=2000 k inside these two cores , the shu77 core has @xmath201 k , and the free - falling core has a bolometric temperature that is half as high , @xmath202 k.    m98 do not calculate the full sed .",
    "instead , they consider the optically thin and thick limits and calculate two moments of the protostellar spectrum : the bolometric temperature and luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "we use dusty to calculate the full radiative transfer in the protostellar system .",
    "finally , m98 use a single power - law to describe the dust emissivity , @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , we use the dust properties calculated by @xcite .",
    "while the dust opacity is aptly described by a power - law at long wavelengths , the shorter wavelength opacities are clearly not properly represented in the same way ( see figure  [ kappa ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the data encompass both models , but m98 s models obviously best cover the median range for the data . however , there are a substantial number of sources that have a lower bolometric luminosity than either model allows .",
    "perhaps , these sources are in the quiescent stage of episodic accretion so that @xmath203 is very low , or these low - luminosity objects could simply have a mass less than 0.3 m@xmath39 and not be included in these models .",
    "also , our models show higher luminosities at later times than most of the data , a result of the aforementioned `` luminosity problem . ''",
    "perhaps , accretion does occur episodically and only for short times , and we should expect only a few objects to be in the phase where material is accreting onto the star and , hence , have a high luminosity .",
    "another explanation , of course , is that the assumption of constant accretion throughout the star s evolution is wrong .      in figure  [ sirtf_colors ] , we show color - magnitude diagrams as would be observed with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) on the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) .",
    "the three mass sequences ( 0.3 , 1.0 , and 3.0 m@xmath39 ) are represented by the black lines in these figures .",
    "we show the magnitude at 24 @xmath4 m ( @xmath204 $ ] ) plotted against the @xmath204-[70]$ ] color ; on the right of figure  [ sirtf_colors ] , we plot @xmath205 $ ] and @xmath205-[160]$ ] .    also , we show the models of w03 from figure 8a of their work .",
    "the colored lines show w03 s calculations over varying angles of inclination .",
    "the magenta line represents almost all inclination angles for the class 0 stage , and the magenta triangle is the class 0 stage as viewed pole - on .",
    "many differences exist between these models and our work .",
    "for example , w03 describe the envelope as a rotating , freely falling envelope @xcite ; w03 also set the envelope s inner radius to be quite small ( @xmath206r@xmath39 ) while we use a much larger inner radius .",
    "in addition , w03 have a number of `` common '' model parameters , which do not change for the different models .",
    "these parameters include the stellar radius , temperature , and mass as well as the overall source luminosity . in our model , we allow all of these to evolve with time . finally , w03 included the effects of outflow cavities , 2-dimensional disks , and varying inclination angles .",
    "we are unable to account for these things .",
    "young objects in the ppc / class 0 segment of their lifespan are very red in our calculations and occupy the lower , right - hand section of this plot . however , these models are bluer in this plane than the w03 models for a class 0 source .",
    "several factors probably contribute to this disparity .",
    "most of the difference arises from the fact that w03 s models have a considerably more luminous central source than our models .",
    "thus , the envelope material is heated more and emits a greater 70 @xmath4 m flux . because w03 uses a very small inner radius , the optical depth is larger than for our models even though they may have similarly massive envelopes .",
    "therefore , relative to the 24 @xmath4 m flux , there is a higher 70 @xmath4 m flux for w03 s models , and their class 0 stage appears redder ( and , of course , more luminous ) .",
    "the effect is much less pronounced in the @xmath205-[160]$ ] plane because these longer wavelength fluxes are less affected by optical depth effects .    as with w03 s models ,",
    "our evolutionary tracks show that the objects become bluer in the @xmath204-[70]$ ] color as the source becomes more luminous and @xmath204 $ ] increases .",
    "we have marked the ppc / class 0 and class 0/i transitions ( as determined by @xmath1 as in section  [ sxn - massratio ] ) .",
    "the class i / ii transition occurs at the end of our modeling sequence when all envelope mass has accreted onto the star and disk . however , aspherical effects are most relevant with these later stages , so these models probably underestimate the 24 @xmath4 m flux for the class i / ii transition .",
    "transitions for the 0.3 m@xmath39 models are shown as cyan squares , the red squares represent the transitions for the 1 m@xmath39 model , and the green squares are for the 3.0 m@xmath39 model .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ sirtf_colors ] shows a simpler behavior for the evolution as seen at 70 and 160 @xmath4 m . as an fhc",
    ", the protostar appears very red but becomes bluer as the core collapses to @xmath423 r@xmath39 and grows in luminosity .",
    "the 160 @xmath4 m flux increases over time as the internal luminosity continues to grow .",
    "however , there is a point where the envelope contains so little material that the 160 @xmath4 m flux drops despite the fact that the far - infrared emission of the internal star is growing . by the end of these tracks ,",
    "the objects have reached the end of their class i stage ; they no longer have envelope material but do have an optically thick disk .",
    "we have presented the results from modeling the evolution of protostars with 3 different masses : 0.3 , 1.0 , and 3.0 m@xmath39 .",
    "the framework for the evolution of these protostars was taken mostly from the work of @xcite but also used the results from several other authors .",
    "these efforts were similar and complementary to the work of @xcite and @xcite but employed different methods and theories and , hence , got different results .",
    "we note that the evolution of these modeled protostars is significantly affected by the existence and lifetime of the first hydrostatic core .",
    "the work done heretofore is useful @xcite , but more detailed theoretical work is needed . as we begin to observe earlier stages of star formation @xcite , the role of the fhc must be ascertained .",
    "we find that the class 0 stage , when determined by @xmath0 , should be short - lived , lasting only about 1/10 to 1/4 of the protostar s life .",
    "this result is somewhat model dependent , but it should also extend to other models of star formation .",
    "therefore , the surveys being conducted with the spitzer space telescope and 2mass should reveal a small fraction of class 0 to class i objects .",
    "however , we suggest not using the @xmath0 criterion for classification .",
    "we find that the bolometric temperature is a poor discriminator for protostars at early evolutionary stages .",
    "instead , we suggest using the @xmath1 signature proposed by @xcite . based on physical grounds , we suggest these boundaries for classifying protostars : @xmath207 for ppc / class 0 , @xmath208 for class 0/i , and @xmath209 for the class i / ii transition .",
    "the latter is largely dependent on the adopted disk model . also , @xmath1 is not relevant after all envelope mass has been accreted ( beyond the class i stage ) since it is a measure of the stellar to envelope mass ratio @xcite .",
    "we have presented several observational tools by which the inside - out collapse model can be effectively tested : infrared color - magnitude diagrams , plots of the bolometric luminosity and temperature , and a plot of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "large surveys will produce these observable quantities for hundreds of young protostars and test the theory of inside - out collapse .",
    "we thank minho choi for the use of his program to calculate the density profiles . also , many thanks to moshe elitzur , maia nenkova , and eljko ivezi for providing the modified version of dusty that allows heating by the isrf and for much assistance in the use of dusty . many thanks also to our anonymous referee",
    "whose thorough reading and thoughtful critique have made this a better paper .",
