    "charmonium strong decays of the type @xmath30 , where @xmath1 is a generic charmonium state , @xmath2 is a nucleon and @xmath3 is a light meson , have recently attracted interest both as sources of information regarding the @xmath5 spectrum @xcite and in searches for a low energy @xmath31 enhancement  @xmath32 \" , which has been reported in @xmath33  @xcite and @xmath34  @xcite , but thus far not in @xmath35 .",
    "these decays are also of interest because their partial widths can be used to estimate the @xmath36 associated charmonium production cross sections at panda @xcite .",
    "as we shall show here , they may also provide information on @xmath37 meson - nucleon coupling constants , which could be used to identify unusual resonances such as molecule or glueball candidates .",
    "specific @xmath30 reactions that have recently been studied experimentally include @xmath38  @xcite , @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite , and @xmath41  @xcite ; @xmath42  @xcite , @xmath43  @xcite , @xmath44  @xcite , @xmath45  @xcite and @xmath41  @xcite , and ( upper limit ) @xmath46  @xcite ; and @xmath47 and @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "these decays may prove to be complicated processes in which several decay mechanisms contribute significantly .",
    "for this reason it will be useful to have predictions for @xmath30 dalitz plot ( dp ) event densities assuming various decay mechanisms ; this paper provides these results for one such mechanism .",
    "in particular we derive the dp event densities that follow from sequential meson emission , in which the charmonium state ( generically @xmath1 ) decays to an intermediate @xmath31 state , which radiates the light meson from the @xmath2 or @xmath48 line , @xmath49 .",
    "the two feynman diagrams assumed in this model are shown in fig.[fig : blr_fig1 ] .",
    "-4 mm   -7 cm    we emphasize that the actual relative importance of this and other @xmath30 decay mechanisms is unclear at present , and may depend strongly on the charmonium state @xmath1 and the light meson @xmath3 ; one purpose of this paper is to determine the rates predicted by this meson emission decay model in isolation for comparison with experiment , so that the importance of this decay mechanism can be estimated .",
    "the predictions of this @xmath49 decay model can be given in some cases with no free parameters , since the strengths of the _ a priori _ unknown couplings @xmath50 and @xmath37 can be estimated from other processes .",
    "here we will give absolute predictions for the set of partial widths @xmath51 ; we use the known partial widths @xmath52 to estimate the @xmath53 couplings , and the final @xmath54 coupling is of course well known .",
    "provided that the contribution of the @xmath49 decay mechanism can be isolated and quantified experimentally , this information can be used to estimate meson - nucleon strong coupling constants ; these are generally poorly known , and play an important role in nuclear physics as input parameters in meson exchange models of the @xmath23 force @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss the determination of the ( well known ) @xmath55 and the ( poorly known ) @xmath41 couplings from the decays @xmath38 , @xmath42 and @xmath56 as examples .",
    "this provides a third motivation for the study of @xmath57 decays ; they may prove useful for estimating @xmath37 coupling constants , in addition to their relevance to @xmath5 spectroscopy @xcite and low - mass @xmath58 dynamics @xcite .",
    "another motivation for studying @xmath30 is the possibility of observing light scalars , including the  @xmath59 \" , the 980  mev states and the scalar glueball , in the decays @xmath60 ( and @xmath61 ) .",
    "here we will usually specialize to charmonium decays to a @xmath62 pair and a neutral meson , @xmath63 ; these decays are reasonably well studied , and enjoy the simplification of equal baryon and antibaryon masses .",
    "our results employ conventions for kinematic variables , meson - baryon couplings and masses that were used in ref.@xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath64 is the mass of the initial charmonium state , @xmath65 is the proton mass , @xmath66 is the mass of meson ( subscript ) @xmath3 , and dimensionless mass ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 are defined relative to the proton mass .",
    "( hence the numerical values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 depend on the decay process . )",
    "we use scaled dimensionless variables @xmath71 and @xmath72 and their inverses @xmath73 and @xmath74 to describe dalitz plots ; these greatly simplify our results .",
    "the dp event densities we present here are formally partial width densities in @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are related to the more familiar differential partial widths by a trivial overall constant ,    = m_p^4  .",
    "[ eq : dp_densities_defn ]    before we give our results for these event densities , it is useful to recall some general properties of a @xmath35 dalitz plot .",

    "although @xmath82 can be evaluated in closed form for @xmath35 with general mass ratios @xmath70 and @xmath69 , the resulting expression is quite lengthy , so when required we will simply evaluate each @xmath82 numerically .",
    "in deriving the dp event densities we have usually assumed that the @xmath83 coupling is a constant @xmath84 times the simplest relevant dirac matrix for the given @xmath1 quantum numbers ; for example , for the @xmath7 we use a pure vector @xmath85 vertex , @xmath86 .",
    "the order of the hadron labels in @xmath87 is meant to reflect the fact that the numerical value of this coupling constant is taken from an @xmath88 transition , here @xmath89 .",
    "this could be a significant concern if form factor effects are large .",
    "we proceed similarly for the light mesons @xmath90 and @xmath91 ; for the pion we use a pure pseudoscalar @xmath54 coupling , with vertex @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for the @xmath94 vertex .",

    "the proximity of the bonn and qcd sum rule parameter predictions for @xmath242 to the current limit suggests that an experimental study with significantly improved sensitivity could make a useful contribution to establishing @xmath230 couplings .",
    "the decay @xmath221 in contrast _ has _ been observed , and has an experimental ( pdg ) branching fraction of @xmath243 , corresponding to @xmath244 .",
    "unfortunately in this case we do not have a theoretical estimate for either @xmath245 or @xmath246 , since the ( valence level , leading - order ) p0 model predicts no @xmath247 coupling .",
    "clearly it would be very interesting to obtain experimental values for these couplings , since little is known about the properties of zweig - suppressed vertices .",
    "again , if the meson emission model gives a good description of this decay , a comparison of eq.([eq : jpsi_ppw ] ) to the experimental @xmath248 dp event distribution should allow an experimental determination of the @xmath247 couplings .",
    "finally , we note in passing that @xmath10 decays to @xmath183 are apparently not in agreement with the meson emission model ; proceeding as above , we would predict a branching fraction of @xmath249 , whereas the pdg experimental value is an order of magnitude smaller , @xmath250 .",
    "possible explanations for this discrepancy , including form factors and ( destructive interference with ) additional decay mechanisms , are discussed in the next section . since",
    "the total @xmath251 data sample reported by cleo @xcite and bes @xcite comprises only about 35 events , it is not yet possible to establish the reason for this large discrepancy between experiment and the meson emission model .",
    "this would ideally involve a comparison between the predicted and observed dalitz plot event densities .",
    "hopefully this comparison will be possible using the large @xmath10 data set being accumulated at bes - iii .",
    "in this paper we have presented and developed a hadron - level  meson emission model \" of charmonium decays of the type @xmath30 , where @xmath1 is a generic charmonium resonance , @xmath2 is a nucleon and @xmath3 is a light meson .",
    "the model assumes that the decays take place through meson emission from the nucleon or antinucleon line , as a hadronic ",
    "final state radiation \" correction to a @xmath252 transition .",
    "as the model is relatively simple , we are able to evaluate the predicted dp event densities for many experimentally accessible and measured processes ; in particular we give event densities for @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( and @xmath10 ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and implicitly all cases with the same @xmath253 quantum numbers .",
    "we used the reaction @xmath38 as a test case with no free parameters ( the @xmath254 and @xmath54 couplings are known ) , and compared the meson emission model predictions for the projected event density in @xmath19 and the partial width @xmath255 to experiment ; the partial width is in good agreement , and the @xmath19 event density appears to describe the non-@xmath5  background \" contribution to this reaction observed experimentally .",
    "we also give predictions for @xmath152 for all @xmath1 cases considered here ; the overall trend of large and small widths and their approximate scale is reproduced by the model",
    ".    we also considered scalar and vector meson production .",
    "we estimated @xmath256 branching fractions for a light @xmath153 , and noted that the @xmath7 and @xmath10 are favored for these studies , and the @xmath10 is favored for glueball searches . in vector production we considered @xmath56 in particular , and noted that a high statistics study of this reaction could be used to estimate the @xmath182 couplings ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 ) , which play a crucial role in meson exchange models of the @xmath23 force .",
    "we showed that the @xmath56 dalitz plot event density is rather sensitive to the poorly known @xmath182 pauli coupling @xmath192 .",
    "determination of meson - nucleon strong couplings is a potentially very interesting application of @xmath35 decays .",
    "there are several theoretical developments that will be very important for future applications of this model .",
    "one should incorporate @xmath5 resonances ; this is conceptually straightforward but may be technically complicated , as it will introduce many new and poorly known resonance coupling parameters and phases .",
    "this development is of course crucial to describe the data in reactions such as @xmath38 , which clearly shows @xmath5 resonance peaks ( fig.[fig : blr_fig3 ] ) .",
    "another important development is the substitution of plausible @xmath257 and @xmath258 hadron vertex form factors for the assumed coupling constants ; the difficulty here is that hadronic form factors are poorly known , and models such as p0 that predict form factors have not been adequately developed and tested .",
    "another interesting generalization of the strong vertices assumed here would be to include a @xmath85 pauli coupling ; as we noted previously @xcite , this can explain the observed @xmath259 angular distribution .",
    "finally , one should include other significant decay mechanisms , as they become apparent through high - statistics studies of experimental dalitz plots .",
    "these additional mechanisms might include intermediate meson resonances @xmath260 that couple strongly to @xmath31 , as in @xmath261 ; if the @xmath260 resonances lie in the physical region , they will give rise to characteristic @xmath260 resonance bands in @xmath213 that could be identified and incorporated in a more complete decay model .",
