    "the study of integrable models constitutes an important area of theoretical physics .",
    "integrable models in condensed matter physics describe interacting many particle systems .",
    "the most prominent examples are interacting spin and electron systems which include several real materials of interest .",
    "integrable models , because of their exact solvability , provide a complete and unambiguous understanding of the variety of phenomena exhibited by real systems .",
    "integrability in the quantum case implies the existence of n conserved quantities where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the corresponding operators including the hamiltonian commute with each other .",
    "more specifically , integrable models are also described as exactly - solvable since the ground state energy and the excitation spectrum of the models can be determined exactly . historically , the first example of the exact solvability of a many body problem was that of a spin@xmath0 quantum spin chain @xcite .",
    "the technique used to solve the eigenvalue problem is now known as the bethe ansatz ( ba ) named after hans bethe who formulated it . the demonstration of integrability , namely , the existence of n commuting operators can be made in the more general mathematical framework of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite .",
    "the ba has been used extensively to obtain exact results for several quantum models in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "examples include the fermi and bose gas models in which particles on a line interact through delta function potentials @xcite , the hubbard model @xcite , 1d plasma which crystallises as a wigner solid @xcite , the lai - sutherland model which includes the hubbard model and a dilute magnetic model as special cases @xcite , the kondo model @xcite , the single impurity anderson model @xcite , the supersymmetric @xmath1 model ( @xmath2 ) etc @xcite .",
    "the ba method has further been applied to derive exact results for classical lattice statistical models in 2d .",
    "the ba denotes a particular form for the many - particle wave function . in a 1d system with pairwise interactions",
    ", a two particle scattering conserves the momenta individually due to the energy and momentum conservation constraints peculiar to 1d .",
    "hence the scattering particles can either retain their original momenta or exchange them . in the case of two particles ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the wave function has the form    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote the locations of the two particles and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the momentum variables .",
    "the wave function can alternatively be written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the scattering phase shift .",
    "the ba generalises the wave function ( eq.(1 ) ) to the general case of n particles and is given by    @xmath11    the sum over p is a sum over all permutations of @xmath12 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath13 is factorisable .",
    "each @xmath13 is a product of factors @xmath14 s corresponding to each exchange of @xmath15 s required to go from the ordering @xmath12 to the ordering p. an overall sign factor may arise depending on the parity of the permutation .",
    "the unknown variables @xmath16 s and @xmath15 s are obtained as solutions of coupled nonlinear equations .",
    "the factorisability condition is at the heart of the exact solvability of the eigenvalue problem . in the more general qism approach ,",
    "the so - called yang - baxter equation provides the condition for factorization of a multi - particle scattering matrix in terms of two - particle scattering matrices .",
    "the traditional ba ( eq.(3 ) ) is known as the coordinate bethe ansatz ( cba ) . over the years",
    ", the ba method has been generalised in different ways . the nested ba technique @xcite has been applied to study a system of particles with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the state of a system of electrons is specified in terms of both the spatial positions as well as the spin indices of the electrons .",
    "the asymptotic bethe ansatz @xcite deals with a class of models in which the interaction between a pair of particles falls off as the inverse square of the distance between the particles .",
    "the thermodynamic bethe ansatz method @xcite is used to calculate thermodynamic quantities and is a finite temperature extension of the ba method .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba ) @xcite has been developed in the powerful mathematical framework of the qism .",
    "the aba and cba are equivalent in the sense that both lead to the same results for the energy eigenvalues .",
    "the cba , however , does not provide knowledge of the correlation functions as the structure of the wave function is not sufficiently explicitly known .",
    "the qism allows the calculation of the correlation functions in some cases @xcite .",
    "the mathematical formalism is also much more systematic and general .",
    "one can further establish the existence of an infinite number ( @xmath17 ) of mutually commuting operators .",
    "the qism moreover provides a prescription for the construction of integrable models . in this review",
    ", we will not discuss the mathematical aspects of integrable models for which a good number of reviews already exist @xcite .",
    "we focus on the physical basis of some integrable spin models in condensed matter physics and the useful physical insights derived from the solution of these models .",
    "the review is not meant to be exhaustive and should be supplemented by the references quoted at the end .",
    "the interest in 1d spin models arises from the fact that there are several real magnetic materials which can be described by such models . the spins",
    "interact via the heisenberg exchange interaction and in many compounds the exchange interaction within a chain of spins is much stronger than that between chains .",
    "thus the compounds effectively behave as linear chain systems .",

    "consider the spins to be of magnitude @xmath23 .",
    "the eigenvalue problems corresponding to the isotropic chain @xmath24 and the longitudinally anisotropic chain @xmath25 were originally solved using the cba . later , the same solutions were obtained using the formalism of qism @xcite .",
    "baxter @xcitecalculated the ground state energy of the fully anisotropic model ( eq.(4 ) ) and johnson , krinsky and mccoy @xcite found the excitation spectrum .",
    "the results were derived on the basis of a special relationship between the transfer matrix of the exactly - solved 2d classical lattice statistical eight vertex model and the fully anisotropic quantum spin hamiltonian @xmath26 .",

    "one can include a magnetic field term @xmath34 in the hamiltonian ( eq.(5 ) ) , where @xmath35 is the strength of the field . given a hamiltonian , the quantities of interest are the ground state energy and the low - lying excitation spectrum .",
    "knowledge of the latter enables one to calculate thermodynamic quantities like magnetization , specific heat and susceptibility at low temperatures . in the case of the fm heisenberg hamiltonian",

    "the ground state is a singlet and the ground state wave function is a linear combination of all possible states in which half the spins are up and the other half down .",
    "the afm ground state can be obtained from the fm ground state by creating @xmath43 magnons with momenta @xmath15 and negative energies @xmath44 .",
    "remember that the sign of the exchange integral is changed in going from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism .",

    "several inelastic neutron scattering measurements have been carried out on these compounds to probe the low - temperature spin dynamics @xcite . in these compounds ,",

    "these two states serve as the `` spinon vacuua '' .",
    "an excitation is created by flipping a block of adjacent spins from the spin arrangement in the nel state .",
    "for example , in figure 1 , a block of seven spins is flipped in the nel state .",
    "the block of overturned spins gives rise to two parallel spin pairs at its boundary with the unperturbed nel configuration .",
    "it is these domain walls or kink solitons which are the equivalents of spinons .",
    "a 2-spinon excited state @xmath106 is obtained as a linear superposition of states in which an odd number @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) of spins is overturned in the nel configuration . in each such state , both the domain walls have equal spin orientations with the spins pointing up .",
    "the excitation continuum of two spinons is obtained in first order perturbation theory .",

    "furthermore , in the framework of a first order perturbation theory , the effects of full anisotropy @xmath109 , next - nearest - neighbour coupling , interchain coupling and exchange mixing have been shown to give rise to asymmetry in lineshapes @xcite .",
    "recently , a large number of studies have been carried out on a class of models in which the interaction between spins falls off as the inverse - square of the distance between them . a lattice model which belongs to this class",
    "is known as the haldane - shastry model @xcite the hamiltonian of which is given by    @xmath110    where @xmath111is the chord distance between the pair of spins separated by @xmath112 sites on a ring with @xmath21 equally spaced spins .",

    "the model is exactly solvable and the key results are : the ground state has a form similar to the fractional quantum hall ground state , the ground state is a qsl and the elementary excitations are the spin@xmath0 spinons obeying fractional statistics , the thermodynamics as well as the various dynamical correlation functions can be calculated exactly .",
    "the latter calculations are possible because of the simple structure of the eigenspectrum .",
    "a correct analysis of the ba equations for the @xmath65 hafm in 1d gave rise to the concept of spinons which has subsequently been verified in experiments .",
    "approximate methods like spin wave theory fail to predict the spinon continuum thus pointing to the importance of integrable models in providing the correct physical picture .",
    "the existence of spinons in dimension greater than one is a highly debatable issue .",
    "no precise statement can be made due to the lack of exact results in @xmath115 .",
    "the issue is of considerable significance in connection with the resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) theory of high temperature superconductivity . in a valence bond ( vb ) state ,",
    "pairs of spins are in singlet spin configurations ( a singlet is often termed as a vb ) .",
    "the rvb state is a coherent linear superposition of vb states . in 1973 ,",
    "anderson @xcite in a classic paper suggested that the ground state of the @xmath65 hafm on the frustrated triangular lattice is a rvb state .",
    "the rvb state is a singlet ( total spin is zero ) and is often described as a quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) since translational as well as rotational symmetries are preserved in the state .",
    "the rvb state is spin disordered and the two - spin correlation function has an exponential decay as a function of the distance between the spins .",
    "interest in the rvb state revived after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in 1987@xcite .",
    "the common structural ingredient of the high@xmath116 cuprate systems is the copper - oxide @xmath117 plane which ideally behaves as a @xmath65 hafm defined on a square lattice .",
    "it is largely agreed that the ground state @xmath118 has afm long range order ( lro ) .",
    "the low - lying excitations are the conventional @xmath119 magnons . in the spinon picture ,",
    "a magnon is a pair of confined spinons .",
    "the spinons can not move apart from each other unlike in 1d .",
    "the cuprates exhibit a rich phase diagram as a function of the dopant concentration .",
    "on doping , positively charged holes are introduced in the @xmath120 plane .",
    "the holes are mobile in a background of antiferromagnetically interacting spins .",
    "the motion of holes acts against antiferromagnetism and the afm lro is rapidly destroyed as the concentration of holes increases .",
    "the resulting spin disordered state has been speculated to be a rvb state . in close analogy with the @xmath65 hafm chain ,",
    "the low - lying spin excitations in the rvb state are pairs of spinons .",
    "the spinons are created by breaking a vb .",
    "the spinons are not confined as in the case of an ordered ground state but separate via a rearrangement of the vbs .",
    "the spinons have spin @xmath23 and charge @xmath121 .",
    "the charge excitations in a rvb state are known as holons with charge @xmath122 and spin @xmath121 .",
    "holons are created on doping the rvb state , i.e. , replacing electrons by holes . spinons and holons",
    "are best decribed as topological excitations in a qsl .",
    "the key feature of the doped rvb state is that of spin - charge separation , i.e. , the spin and charge excitations are decoupled entities .",
    "spin - charge separation can be rigorously demonstrated in the case of interacting electron systems in 1d known by the general name of luttinger liquids ( lls ) . the hubbard model in 1d",
    "is the most well - known example of a ll .",
    "the model is integrable and the ba results for the excitation spectrum confirm that the spinons and the holons are the elementary excitations @xcite .",
    "coming back to the rvb state , there has been an intensive search for spin models in 2d with rvb states as exact ground states .",
    "recent calculations show that there is afm lro in the ground state of the @xmath65 hafm on the triangular lattice , contrary to anderson s original conjecture @xcite .",
    "frustrated spin models with n.n . as well as non - n.n .",
    "exchange interactions have been constructed for which the rvb states are the exact ground states in certain parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "these are short - ranged rvb states with the vbs forming between n.n .",
    "spin pairs .",
    "the spinon excitation spectrum in this case is gapped . a model which captures the low energy dynamics in the rvb scenario is the quantum dimer model ( qdm)@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model defined on a square lattice is given by    @xmath123    where the solid lines represent dimers ( vbs ) and the sum runs over all the plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian is the kinetic part representing the flipping of a pair of parallel dimers on the two bonds of a plaquette to the other possible orientation , i.e. , from horizontal to vertical and vice versa .",
    "the second term counts the number of flippable pairs of dimers in any dimer configuration and is analogous to the potential term of the hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state of the qdm on the square lattice is not , however , a qsl except at the special point @xmath124 .",
    "moessner and sondhi @xcite have studied the qdm on the triangular lattice and shown that , in contrast to the square lattice case , the ground state is a rvb state with deconfined , gapped spinons in a finite range of parameters . recently , some microscopic models of 2d magnets have been proposed @xcite the low - lying excitations of which are of three types : spinons , holons and `` vortex - like '' excitations with no spin and charge , dubbed as visons .",
    "some of these models are related to the qdm .",
    "two integrable models @xcite have been constructed which share common topological features with the microscopic models in 2d and have applications in fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "the models , however , can not resolve the issue of spinons in 2d as quantum numbers like the total @xmath125 are not conserved in these models .",
    "the search for microscopic models in 2d , with spinons as elementary excitations , acquires particular significance in the light of recent experimental evidence of the spinon continuum in the 2d frustrated quantum antiferromagnet @xmath126 @xcite .",

    "exactly solvable models in 2d are needed for a clear understanding of the origin of the experimentally observed spinon continuum .",
    "real materials are often anisotropic in character .",
    "the anisotropy may be present in the exchange interaction hamiltonian itself or there may be additional terms in the hamiltonian corresponding to different types of anisotropy .",
    "a well - known anisotropic interaction , present in many afm materials , is the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction with the general form    @xmath127    moriya @xcite provided the microscopic basis of the dm interaction by extending anderson s superexchange theory to include the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the dm coupling acts to ca nt the spins because the coupling energy is minimised when the two spins are perpendicular to each other .",
    "some examples of materials with dm interaction include the quasi-2d compound @xmath126 @xcite , the @xmath120 planes of the undoped cuprate system @xmath128 @xcite , the quasi-1d compound cu - benzoate @xcite etc .",
    "the dm canting of spins is responsible for the small ferromagnetic moment of the @xmath120 planes even though the dominant in - plane exchange interaction is afm in nature .",
    "alcaraz and wreszinski @xcite have shown that the @xmath40 quantum heisenberg chain ( both fm and afm ) with dm interaction is equivalent to the @xmath40 hamiltonian with modified boundary conditions and anisotropy parameter @xmath129 .",
    "the dm interaction is assumed to be of the form    @xmath130    , i.e. , the vector @xmath131 in eq.(23 ) is in the z - direction .",
    "the new anisotropy parameter is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the anisotropy parameter of the original @xmath40 hamiltonian . with changed boundary conditions , the model is still ba solvable .",
    "in fact , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath134 , the boundary conditions do not affect the critical behaviour .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian , which includes both the @xmath40 hamiltonian and the dm interaction , has the same critical properties and the phase diagram as the @xmath40 hamiltonian with the anisotropy parameter @xmath132 .",

    "one octet consists of two - particle excitations : two charge @xmath292 cooper pairs around zero momentum , a triplet of @xmath119 magnons around momentum @xmath293 and three neutral @xmath184 particle - hole pair excitations .",
    "@xmath289 transformations rotate the components of the vector multiplet into one another unifying the excitations in the process .",
    "the @xmath294 subgroup which rotates only the first five components of the vector is the symmetry proposed by zhang @xcite to unify antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "the vector octet is related by a triality symmetry to two other octets with mass gap @xmath295 .",
    "the @xmath296 particles of these two octets have the features of quasi - electrons and quasi - holes . above the 24 states with mass gap @xmath295 , there are other higher - lying `` bound '' states with mass gap @xmath297 . finally , the continuum of scattering states occurs above the energy @xmath298 .",
    "lin et al has further studied the effects of doping a small concentration of holes into the mott insulating phase . in this limit",
    ", the effect of doping can be incorporated in the gn model by adding a term @xmath299 to the hamiltonian , @xmath257 being the chemical potential and @xmath300 the total charge .",
    "integrability of the gn model is not lost as @xmath300 is a global @xmath289 generator .",
    "doping is possible only for @xmath301 when cooper pairs enter the system .",
    "the doped ladder exists in the luther - emery phase , whereas in the half - filled insulating limit both the spin and charge excitations are gapped . in the doped phase",
    ", the cooper pairs can transport charge and quasi - long - range @xmath254wave sc pairing correlations develop in the system .",
    "the other features of the standard @xmath1 ladder model , e.g. , the discontinuous evolution of the sg on doping is reproduced .",
    "the lowest triplet excitation is a bound state of a @xmath119 magnon with a cooper pair . as mentioned before ,",
    "a similar result has been obtained numerically in the case of the standard @xmath1 ladder @xcite .",
    "the triplet excitation belongs to the family of @xmath302 excitations with mass gap @xmath303 if @xmath304 denotes the dopant concentration , then the sg jumps from @xmath305 to @xmath306 upon doping .",
    "the integrability of the weakly - interacting two - chain ladder model has yielded a plethora of exact results which illustrate the rich physics associated with undoped and doped ladders .",
    "integrable models have a dual utility .",
    "they serve as testing grounds for approximate methods and techniques . also , they are often models of real systems and provide rigorous information about the physical properties of such systems .",
    "integrable models are sometimes more general than what are required to describe real systems . in such cases",
    ", an integrable model corresponds to an exactly solvable point in the general phase diagram .",
    "the point may be a quantum critical point at which transition from one quantum phase to another occurs or the integrable model may be in the same phase as a more realistic model . in the latter case ,",
    "the physical properties of the two models are similar . in this review",
    ", we have discussed the physical basis of some integrable spin models with special focus on the relevance of the models to real systems .",
    "the heisenberg spin chain is probably the best example of the essential role played by exact solvability in correctly interpreting the experimental data .",
    "the concept of spinons owes its origin to the exact analysis of the ba equations .",
    "the theoretical prediction motivated the search for real spin systems in which experimental confirmation could be made . in this review , examples are also given of systems for which the links between integrable models and experimental results are not well established .",
    "a major portion of the review is devoted to physical systems which exhibit rich phenomena , like the systems with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom and undoped and doped spin ladder systems , where the need for integrable systems is particularly strong .",
    "these systems exhibit a variety of novel phenomena a proper understanding of which should be based on rigorous theory .",
    "two - dimensional spin systems with qsl ground states have been specially mentioned to explain the recent interest in constructing integrable models of such systems .",
    "the review is meant to be an elementary introduction to the genesis and usefulness of integrable models vis -  - vis physical spin systems .",
    "future challenges are also highlighted to motivate further research on integrable models .",
    "there are some afm spin models which are not integrable but for which the ground states and in some cases the low - lying excited states are known exactly .",
    "the most prominent amongst these are the majumdar - ghosh ( mg ) chain @xcite and the aklt @xcite model respectively .",
    "the mg hamiltonian is defined in 1d for spins of magnitude @xmath307 .",
    "the hamiltonian includes both n.n . as well as n.n.n",
    ". interactions .",
    "the strength of the latter is half that of the former",
    ". the exact ground state is doubly degenerate and the states consist of singlets along alternate links of the lattice .",
    "the excitation spectrum is not exactly known and has been calculated on the basis of a variational wave function @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the mg model to 2d with exactly - known ground states are possible @xcite .",
    "the shastry - sutherland model @xcite is of much current interest due to the recent discovery of the compound @xmath308 which is well - described by the model @xcite .",
    "some of these models including the aklt model have been reviewed in the references @xcite from which more information about the models can be obtained .",
    "these models incorporate physical features of real systems and provide valuable insight on the magnetic properties of low - dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "the models supplement integrable models in obtaining exact information and provide motivation for the construction of integrable generalisations .",
