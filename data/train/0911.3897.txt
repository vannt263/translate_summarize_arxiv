    "galactic - scale gas outflows appear to play an important role in the evolution of the universe , possibly providing an explanation for a number of cosmological questions ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these galactic outflows are frequently observed in local galaxies with high star formation rates and/or an active nucleus , often extending on a scale of order of a few kiloparsecs or larger .",
    "the high frequency of outflows measured in high - redshift , actively star - forming objects such as lyman break galaxies suggests that outflows are a common stage in galactic evolution , with wind velocities decreasing over time @xcite .",
    "such outflows may be responsible for the deficit of baryons seen in our own milky way galaxy and the mass - metallicity relation in external galaxies , if winds are capable of preferentially ejecting metals into the intergalactic medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "the intergalactic medium can be heated as well as enriched with metals by these galactic outflows , since energy inputs into the igm on the order of 10@xmath8 ergs have been measured from galaxies with strong outflows @xcite .",
    "additionally , outflows may quench star formation by heating up cold gas and ejecting it from the host @xcite .",
    "specifically , agn - powered outflows have been proposed as the cause of the drop in agn luminosity at low redshift and the cutoff at high luminosity of the galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "these winds may also limit black hole and spheroid growth , and be responsible for the observed tight correlation between black hole mass and galactic spheroid mass @xcite .",
    "finally , winds driven by agn and/or starbursts may help remove enough nuclear material with low angular momentum early on in the evolution of gas - rich systems to aid in the formation of large disks with high specific angular momentum , more in line with the observations @xcite .",
    "studies performed on actively star - forming galaxies , near and far , have revealed that outflow energetics increase with infrared ( 8 - 1000 @xmath9 ) luminosity , l_@xmath2 , or equivalently , star formation rate ( @xcite , hereafter rvs05a ; @xcite , hereafter rvs05b ; @xcite ) .",
    "outflows have also been detected in composite galaxies with both starbursts and agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "seyfert 1 composites show significantly higher outflow velocities than pure starbursts and seyfert 2 composites ( @xcite , hereafter rvs05c ) .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of starburst - driven outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have difficulties reproducing the very high velocities detected in seyfert 1 composites .",
    "the agn in these objects thus appear to play a significant role in driving these outflows , at least on small scales @xcite .",
    "the situation in seyfert 2 composites is more ambiguous ",
    "the agn or starburst or both could be powering the outflow in these systems @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is on `` pure '' seyfert galaxies with weak infrared starbursts .",
    "our sample consists of 35 galaxies that are faint in the infrared ( 10@xmath0 @xmath1 l_@xmath2/l_@xmath3  @xmath1  10@xmath10 ) , equally split between seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s .",
    "we compare the results from our study with those from previous studies of starburst and seyfert ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; l_@xmath2/l_@xmath3  @xmath11 10@xmath12 ) and luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; 10@xmath4 @xmath1 l_@xmath2/l_@xmath3  @xmath1 10@xmath12 ) to isolate the role of the agn in powering these outflows . as in previous studies ,",
    "the ir - faint objects were observed in the  d  @xmath135890,5896 doublet absorption feature .",
    "this na feature has a low ionization potential ( 5.1 ev ) , so it probes neutral gas , and it can be used to study the ism due to its high interstellar abundance .",
    "all objects in the sample have @xmath14 @xmath1 0.05 , and thus the  d  feature is found in the optical .",
    "velocity components in  d  absorption are unambiguous indicators of outflowing ( blueshifted velocities ) or inflowing ( redshifted velocities ) gas , as there must be a continuum source behind the absorber .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the sample is described in section [ sample ] , including methods of selection and sample properties in terms of redshifts , star formation rates , and spectral types .",
    "the observations are discussed in section [ obs ] .",
    "section [ analysis ] describes the line fitting , the derivations of the velocities and column densities , and estimates of the expected stellar contributions to the measured  d  absorption . in section [ outsec ]",
    "we present the results on outflows , starting with the seyfert 2s and followed by the seyfert 1s .",
    "next , section [ insec ] describes the results on inflows in the same fashion as section [ outsec ] .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the implications of our findings in section [ disc ] , including comparisons with previous studies , dynamical estimates , and possible connections between inflows and nuclear structures .",
    "we conclude in section [ conc ] with a summary of our findings .",
    "all calculations in this study assume present - day cosmological parameter values , with @xmath15 @xmath16 75 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath17 @xmath16 0.3 , and @xmath18 @xmath16 0.7 .",
    "all wavelengths quoted are vacuum wavelengths .",
    "the objects in the sample were selected using three main criteria : they had to be optically classified as seyferts and had to be faint in the infrared ( l_@xmath2  @xmath19 10@xmath4 l_@xmath3 ) .",
    "all objects in the sample were also selected to have @xmath14 @xmath1 0.05 to focus on the brightest sources and obtain reliable measurements .",
    "most galaxies in the sample are well - studied seyfert galaxies with extensive ancillary data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "roughly equal numbers of seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies were chosen to allow meaningful comparisons with the study of rvs05c on ulirg seyferts .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the agn in the present sample are well matched to those in the composite systems of rvs05c .",
    "this allows us to make direct comparisons between the two samples .",
    "basic properties for the galaxies in our sample can be found in table  [ objprop ] .",
    "the last column in that table lists the references used for the compilation .",
    "not all objects in this survey have well - constrained published redshift measurements , so preference was given to values from stellar absorption lines @xcite when possible , followed by redshifts taken from hi lines @xcite .",
    "redshifts measured from data in the present survey were used if neither of the preceding were available , but were given low priority due to systematic errors ( @xmath5 10@xmath20 ) associated with these measurements ( e.g. it is possible that part of the narrow line region ( nlr ) is outflowing so the velocities based on the narrow emission lines are not necessarily representative of the systemic velocity ) . in this case , iraf was used to measure central wavelength of various emission lines , including [ ]  @xmath21 , [ ]  @xmath136548 ,  6583 , and [ ]  @xmath22 , and redshifts were calculated from those values .      to estimate the star formation rates in these objects , we use their far - infrared luminosity , @xmath23(40 - 120 @xmath24 m ) , under the assumption that the agn does not contribute significantly to l_@xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this is probably a good first - order approximation although agn may contribute @xmath510 - 20% to l_@xmath25  @xcite .",
    "l_@xmath25  is calculated using the prescription of sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) , using data from the _ iras _ faint source and _ iras _ point source catalogs .",
    "l_@xmath25  is then used to calculate sfr using the relation in kennicutt ( 1998 ) , @xmath26 @xmath27 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the far - infrared luminosities and star formation rates of the objects in our sample are listed in table  [ objprop ] .",
    "spectral classifications were taken from the nasa extragalactic database and confirmed through examination of emission lines in the spectra and references in the literature .",
    "seyfert 1  1.5 were labeled seyfert 1s for the purpose of this study , while seyfert 1.8  2 were labeled seyfert 2s .",
    "this is in keeping with the classification scheme of rvs05c and allows for comparisons of our results on seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies with those of previous studies .",
    "all observations were taken over the course of three different observing runs on the kitt peak 4-meter telescope . observing runs , exposure times , and slit position angles for all objects are listed in table  [ objprop ] .",
    "all data were taken using the ritchey - chr@xmath28tien spectrograph with a moderate - resolution grating , kpc-18c , in the first order along with the gg-475 blocking filter .",
    "the wavelength range was 1700  , allowing measurements of both the  d  absorption doublet and h@xmath29 @xmath30 [ ]   emission complex in the same exposure .",
    "this combination provides an average resolution of 85 km  s@xmath7  with a 1@xmath3125 slit .",
    "median signal - to - noise ratio near  d  was 85 per   and ranged from 23 to 337 per  , with seeing ranging from @xmath51 to 2  on average .",
    "extraction and fitting procedures were performed as described in the original study ( rvs05a ) , but the basic procedure will be outlined here ; the method uses assumptions similar to those in a curve of growth analysis but does explicitly fit the line profiles .",
    "the spectral extraction was done while keeping a constant physical aperture size of @xmath53 kpc ; this aperture size was selected to match the seeing and therefore reduce host galaxy contamination as much as possible .",
    "the reduction and calibration were performed using standard iraf reduction packages .",
    "henear lamps were used for wavelength calibration and stars such as g191-b2b and bd+25 4655 were used as flux standards .    once the spectra were reduced and calibrated , the region containing the  d  absorption doublet , as well as the neighboring  @xmath325876 emission line , was isolated .",
    "a levenberg - marquardt fitting routine was used to fit one to two components to the  emission and the  d  absorption doublet line profile . for emission lines ,",
    "the formula used to fit the intensity of the line was : @xmath33 where the amplitude , a , the doppler parameter , @xmath34 ( @xmath34 = @xmath35 ) , and the central wavelength , @xmath36 , were free parameters . for absorption lines ,",
    "the formula used to fit was : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the covering fraction of the line ( see section  [ mme ] ) , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the optical depths of each of the two lines of the  d  doublet ; @xmath39 corresponds to the line at 5896  , and @xmath41 . in general , the optical depth @xmath42 is given by : @xmath43 equations 2 and 3 were used to fit each line of the  d  doublet . for each  d  doublet pair , the covering fraction , @xmath38 , central optical depth and wavelength of the red line ( @xmath39 and @xmath44 ) , and line width , @xmath34 , were free parameters in the fit .",
    "covering fraction was assumed to be independent of wavelength ( and the same for both doublet lines ) , and the optical depths of the two doublet lines are fixed by atomic physics ( as stated above : @xmath40 @xmath16 2@xmath39 ) . because of these constraints , and the assumption of a gaussian in optical depth space , both @xmath38 and @xmath45 can be constrained simultaneously for each doublet .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is still some anticorrelation between @xmath38 and @xmath45 in the fit due to uncertainty in line shape and relative intensities . in the case of multiple , gaussian velocity components ,",
    "each velocity component arises in both lines of the doublet , so that @xmath38 and @xmath45 can be constrained independently for each velocity component .",
    "initial guesses for these parameters were supplied to the fitting program and a best fit was determined and plotted .",
    "either one or two components were used to fit the  emission line .",
    "unless an absorption fit with two separate velocity components ( corresponding to two separate  d  doublets ) was considerably better than a fit with one velocity component , only one velocity component ( one  d  doublet ) was used to fit the absorption features .",
    "only six objects showed convincing evidence for a two velocity components in absorption .",
    "examples of the deblending of the  d  feature for two seyfert 1 and two seyfert 2 objects can be seen in figure  [ deblends ] .",
    "after fitting was performed , a monte carlo simulation with 1000 iterations was then run , in order to determine the parameter errors .",
    "particular care is needed when fitting the  emission at 5876  , since the  emission line in these objects is generally quite broad and has multiple components .",
    "so , for those objects showing  emission lines , the h@xmath29 @xmath30 [ ]   complex was also examined to verify the accuracy of the fit to  .",
    "an interpolation script was written in idl to subtract out the [ ]  @xmath136548 ,  6583  features and thus isolate the h@xmath29 line .",
    "the resulting h@xmath29 line was generally fit using two components , one narrow and one broad .",
    "the  @xmath30  d  complex was then refit , but this time parameters for  emission lines were constrained to be those of the h@xmath29 line . the results from the fits with fully fixed parameters ( `` fixed '' )",
    "were then compared to those from the fits with free - floating parameters ( `` free '' ) ; agreement is observed within 2 - 5% .",
    "again , the errors on these parameters were determined from the monte carlo simulations after all fits were completed .",
    "the reduced @xmath46 for the two types of fits are compared in figure  [ redchi ] .",
    "there are fewer points farther away from a reduced @xmath46 of unity for the free - floating fit .",
    "we therefore choose to use the results from the free - floating fits in the following discussion ( this is further justified in the next section ) .",
    "once fitting was done , velocities for these  d  absorption lines were calculated , relative to the systemic velocities using redshifts as outlined in section [ redsec ] . in the following , @xmath47 is the velocity difference between the  d  velocity centroid measured in the fit and the systemic  d  velocity .",
    "errors were propagated through both from the fit and the redshift measurement .",
    "a `` maximum '' velocity of @xmath48 - fwhm/2 , which takes into account both the shift and width of the absorption line , was also computed .",
    "values of @xmath47 and @xmath49 were compared for values resulting from the free  fit and the fixed  fit in order to determine the impact of fixing the  parameters to those of h@xmath29 .",
    "plots of those comparisons are displayed in figure  [ dvf1f4 ] .",
    "the agreement is good , with only three objects showing values that are not equal within the uncertainties .",
    "of those , only one has @xmath50 @xmath51 50 km  s@xmath7 , which would change its outflow or inflow classification .",
    "in all three of those outlying cases , the  line appears to be broader than the h@xmath29 line .",
    "this is plausible , since all of these objects are seyfert 1 galaxies and so collisional and radiative transfer effects in the broad line region may affect the  profile in a different way than the h@xmath29 profile .",
    "as there is little significant difference between the free - floating and fully - fixed fits , our adoption of the free - floating fits in section [ linefit ] seems appropriate .",
    "after velocities were calculated , a detection criterion of @xmath47 @xmath1 @xmath5250 km  s@xmath7  was used to determine whether or not an object possesses an outflow .",
    "similarly , @xmath47 @xmath51 50 km  s@xmath7  was used as the cutoff for the detection of an inflow . a 2-@xmath53 threshold in measurement uncertainty ( @xmath54 @xmath51 2@xmath55(@xmath47 ) , where @xmath55(@xmath47 ) is the measurement error )",
    "was also required for inflow / outflow classification , but this did not eliminate any objects from being classified as showing inflow or outflow . as outlined in the initial study ( rvs05a ) , the 50 km  s@xmath7  cutoff accounts for potential contamination from errors in wavelength calibration ( @xmath1910 km  s@xmath7 ) , fitting ( @xmath510 km  s@xmath7 ) , redshift measurements ( @xmath5 10 - 15 km  s@xmath7 ) , and the possibility of small blue- and redshifts due to gas in rotation .",
    "fit parameters and derived velocities are listed in table  [ compprop ] .      the optical depth @xmath45 and doppler parameter @xmath34 as determined by the fitting function were used to calculate column densities of  d  and h along the line of sight . as described in spitzer ( 1978 ) ,",
    "the column density of  d  in @xmath56 is given by : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the oscillator strength , @xmath59 is the rest frame vacuum wavelength (  ) , and @xmath60 is the central optical depth of the  d  @xmath325896 line .",
    "the doppler parameter , @xmath34 , is in units of km  s@xmath7 .",
    "values of @xmath58 @xmath16 0.3180 and @xmath59 @xmath16 5897.55    were taken from morton ( 1991 ) .    to properly calculate the column density of hydrogen",
    ", we must correct for the effects of dust depletion and ionization .",
    "this process is also outlined in rvs05a , and uses empirical results that assume galactic depletion and an ionization fraction of 0.9 .",
    "the formula used is : @xmath61 column densities are again given in @xmath56 , @xmath62 is the ionization fraction , and @xmath63 and @xmath34 are the na abundance and depletion onto dust in the object for which calculations are being performed , respectively . whereas a near - ir luminosity - metallicity relation was used to determine na abundance in the previous rvs05b and rvs05c studies , we here assume that these objects have solar na abundance .",
    "calculated column densities for each object can be found in table  [ compprop ] .",
    "stellar  d  absorption may contribute to the observed  d  feature .",
    "stellar features from other elements may also contaminate the measurements if they are located close to the  d  feature .",
    "the original study used a scaling relation between  d  and  _ b _  equivalent width to determine the stellar  d  contribution , as na and mg are created in a similar fashion ( rvs05a ) .",
    "however , the spectral range for our data begins at roughly 5500   and so does not include that  _ b _  triplet , so we must use the other method outlined in that study : stellar population synthesis models .",
    "as in rvs05a , we used the population synthesis code ( sed@.0 ) of gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which combines a young ( 40 myr ) , instantaneous burst stellar population with an old ( 10 gyr ) population .",
    "one model uses a stellar mass ratio of 10%/90% for young _ versus _ old populations , and the other uses 1%/99% . in order to enhance weak stellar features ,",
    "the spectra were boxcar smoothed by  150 km  s@xmath7  and convolved with a @xmath53 @xmath16 200 km  s@xmath7  gaussian .",
    "our spectra were emission subtracted , using fitting parameters to remove  and leave only the  d  absorption .",
    "they were then overlaid with the stellar population synthesis models .",
    "almost all objects with suspected outflows or inflows showed absorption that was much deeper than the stellar absorption alone .",
    "the extreme examples of mrk  352 and mrk  6 are shown in figure  [ spop ] . in mrk  352",
    ", the results from stellar population synthesis show a high likelihood that the bulk of the  d  absorption is stellar .",
    "in contrast , mrk  6 shows a definite high - velocity outflow .",
    "figure  [ sytspectrai ] shows the  and  d  complexes for all of the 17 seyfert 2 galaxies in this study , plotted on a velocity scale based on  d  @xmath325890 systemic .",
    "tables  [ outindiv ] and [ avgpropout ] list the measured properties for each  d  outflow velocity component and overall outflow averages , combined with data for seyfert ulirgs from rvs05c .    out of a total of 17 seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "we detected blueshifted  d  absorption with @xmath47 @xmath1 @xmath5250 km  s@xmath7  in 3 objects , for an outflow rate of 18 @xmath64 9% . no objects were ruled out by the 2-@xmath53 criterion in measurement uncertainty , which requires @xmath54 @xmath51 2@xmath55(@xmath47 ) for a detection ( see section [ velcalc ] ) . of those objects which fit the outflow criteria , only one , ngc  7319 , showed convincing evidence for two velocity components in absorption .",
    "the implications of this low detection rate are discussed in section [ outdisc ] .",
    "velocities for these objects were all within 20 km  s@xmath7  of each other , ranging from @xmath52130 to @xmath52148 km  s@xmath7 . the maximum velocity , v_max@xmath49  @xmath65 @xmath47 @xmath52 fwhm/2 , showed a much larger range ( due to the broader range of doppler parameters ) , from @xmath52176 to @xmath52504 km  s@xmath7 , with ngc  7319 showing the largest v_max@xmath49  ( table  [ avgpropout ] ) .",
    "we further discuss these results in section [ outdisc ] .",
    "previous studies have shown that it is common for seyfert 2 galaxies to have asymmetric emission lines with extended blue wings .",
    "these asymmetries are generally believed to be the result of outflowing gas in the narrow line region of the agn , and outflowing gas in the nlr has been spatially resolved in both seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "this emission line asymmetry , however , is not an unambiguous indicator of outflow in the way absorption is since one can not differentiate between outflowing line - emitting material in front of the nucleus and infalling material on the far side of the nucleus .",
    "blue - wing emission asymmetries can only be interpreted as outflow if we are absolutely sure we are not seeing the opposite side of the object @xcite .",
    "the primary focus of our paper is blueshifted  d  absorption , but it is of interest to look for blue - wing emission line asymmetry in our seyfert 2 galaxies to see if it is at all correlated with our findings on  d  outflows . in rvs05c , 75% of seyfert 2",
    "nuclei showed blue emission - line asymmetry ( bela ) , compared to a 45%  d  outflow detection rate .",
    "we have used [ ]  @xmath136548 ,  6583  to look for bela in our objects ( the high - ionization [ ]  @xmath66  line most commonly used in bela detection is not within our wavelength range ) .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath136548 ,  6583   lines were separated from h@xmath29 by taking the blue wing of the [ ]  @xmath67  line and the red wing of the [ ]  @xmath68  line , and plotting them together about @xmath47 @xmath16 0 .",
    "the two wings were then scaled appropriately to match each other in intensity , and bela determination was done by visual inspection .",
    "5 out of 17 seyfert 2 galaxies ( 29% ) showed evidence for bela .",
    "the most obvious case of bela is ngc  5252 . of those which show bela , only one ( ngc  7319 ) has been determined to have an  d  outflow , and one ( mrk  348 ) actually shows a  d  inflow ( section [ insyt ] ) , though it is the least asymmetric of all the bela objects .",
    "those five objects , along with a comparison object with a  d  outflow but no bela ( mrk  622 ) , are shown in figure  [ bela ] . another object ( ngc  3786 ; not shown in the figure ) shows prominent red - wing asymmetry ; this object presents an  d  outflow rather than an inflow .",
    "overall , we find no obvious correlation between emission and absorption signatures of outflow , although the statistics are poor .",
    "moreover , we can not formally rule out the possibility that the difference in outflow and bela detection rates is simply due to our use of [ ]  as a bela probe since belas are more often seen in high - ionization lines like [ ]  than in low - ionization lines like [ ] @xcite .",

    "our detection rates are even lower in comparison to non - seyfert ulirgs , since rates of 80% @xmath64 7% and 46% @xmath64 13% were measured for low-@xmath14 and high-@xmath14 ulirgs in rvs05b , and a rate of 83% was reported in martin ( 2005 ) .",
    "poststarburst galaxies have also been found to have high outflow detection rates on the order of 70% @xcite .",
    "the measured outflow detection rates in the ir - faint seyfert galaxies are therefore considerably smaller than those of pure starbursting galaxies , poststarbursts , and agn + starburst composites .",
    "previous observations have indicated that the outflow detection rate increases with infrared luminosity ( rvs05b , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ detrateplots ] shows the outflow detection rates of the ir - faint seyferts in our sample as well as the the ir - luminous seyferts and starburst ulirgs and lirgs of rvs05b and rvs05c as a function of l_@xmath25 .",
    "the increase in outflow detection rate with l_@xmath25  is apparent , despite the limited range in l_@xmath25 .",
    "as l_@xmath25  is correlated with the star formation rate , this increase in the detection rate with l_@xmath25  suggests that star formation in all of these systems is the main driver of neutral outflows detected in .",
    "geometry could also be playing a role , since agn winds with smaller opening angles ( higher collimation ) would reduce the detection rate ( see section [ mme ] ) .",
    "histograms showing the distributions of all ( negative and positive ) velocities in our current data as well as those of rvs05b and rvs05c provide another point of comparison ( figure  [ velhistplots ] ) .",
    "the left panel compares the velocities of ir - faint seyfert galaxy components from this study to the seyfert and starburst ulirgs & lirgs of rvs05b and rvs05c .",
    "we can safely rule out rotation as being a primary cause for the motion of the  d  gas based on the fact that we do not observe a symmetry about zero velocity in these histograms . were rotation the dominant gas motion , we should observe roughly equal amounts of blueshifted and redshifted gas in each object and in the overall distributions shown in figure 8 , assuming the  d  gas is distributed more or less symmetrically around the center of rotation and is unaffected by severe differential obscuration .",
    "negative velocities are found in a much higher percentage of ir - luminous objects ( seyferts of rvs05c and starbursts of rvs05b ) than ir - faint objects , again indicating that outflows are both stronger and more frequent on average in objects with high sfr .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ velhistplots ] combines together the ir - faint and ir - luminous seyferts from this study and rvs05c and compares them to the starbursts of rvs05b . in terms of the negative velocities ,",
    "the results for seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies are quite different , with seyfert 2 galaxies showing similar outflow percentages to those of the ulirgs & lirgs .",
    "this suggests a physical connection between the mechanisms that drive outflows in seyfert 2s and starbursting galaxies and a physical difference between the mechanisms that cause outflows in seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s .",
    "interestingly , studies of _ ionized _ gas outflows have not found such a dichotomy in velocities between seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests that the neutral gas probed by our  d  observations is not kinematically related to the ionized material of the nlr .",
    "this difference is even more obvious when we also consider our results on positive ( inflow ) velocities ( section [ incomp ] ) .",
    "rigorous statistical tests confirm these results .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and kuiper tests were both used , as the k - s test has an inherent bias in terms of differences in the mean and the kuiper test does not .",
    "low values reported by both of these tests can help rule out two sets of data having the same parent distribution .",
    "results of these tests are listed in table  [ stattests ] .",
    "the small values of @xmath69(null ) for @xmath47 and v_max@xmath49  when comparing ir - faint and ir - luminous seyferts suggest that they do not come from the same parent distribution .",
    "a more significant comparison comes from combining together the results for the ir - faint seyfert galaxies from this study and those for the ir - luminous seyfert galaxies from rvs05c , and comparing them with those for the starburst ulirgs and lirgs from rvs05b .",
    "the same statistical tests were performed on these distributions , first using all velocities , then the outflowing components only .",
    "the results are listed in tables  [ stattests2a ] and [ stattests2b ] , respectively .",
    "the results in table [ stattests2a ] indicate that seyferts and starbursts do not share the same parent velocity distributions ; we return to this point in section [ indisc ] .",
    "when considering only the outflowing components , all comparisons show low probability of originating from the same parent distribution except when the seyfert 2 galaxies are compared with the starburst ulirgs & lirgs . in that case , both the k - s and kuiper tests return large @xmath69(null ) values .",
    "this confirms quantitatively that the outflows in these two classes of objects may arise from the same physical process .",
    "figure  [ dvmaxplots ] displays plots showing v_max@xmath49  as a function of far - ir luminosity ( correlated with star formation rate ) and of galactic circular velocity ( correlated with galactic mass ) for seyferts from this study , ir - luminous seyferts from rvs05c , starburst lirgs & ulirgs from rvs05b , and four starburst dwarf galaxies from schwartz & martin ( 2004 ) .",
    "the four dwarfs were added in order to see if low - mass galaxies follow the same trends as high - mass systems .",
    "the ir - faint seyfert 2 galaxies seem to follow the same trends as the ir - bright galaxies , with v_max@xmath49  increasing with both sfr and galactic mass , while the outflow velocities of all seyfert 1 galaxies lie above these trends .",
    "this again suggests a fundamental difference in the way the winds in ir - faint / bright seyfert 1 galaxies are powered compared with the winds in ir - faint / bright seyfert 2 and starburst galaxies .",
    "we return to this issue in section [ mme ] .",
    "another useful comparison between ir - faint and ir - luminous seyferts is to look at the dynamical properties in addition to the kinematics . using calculated covering fraction , column density , and velocities , we can estimate the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy of the neutral gas phase of the ism being probed by those winds .",
    "we follow the method outlined in the original study ( rvs05b ) , which made the assumption that the outflows are spherically symmetric mass - conserving free winds , with a velocity and instantaneous mass outflow rate which do not depend on radius within the wind and which are zero outside the wind .",
    "this method also assumed that the wind is a thin shell with a uniform radius of 5 kpc .",
    "this value was based on actual spatial measurements in some of the objects of rvs05c , but such spatial measurements are not available for our ir - faint seyfert galaxies . in the present study , we use a 5 kpc radius for both the seyfert 2 and seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "this is different from the radius of 10 pc that was used for the seyfert 1 galaxies in the original study ( rvs05c ) ; the radius in ir - faint seyfert 1s was chosen to be the same as for ir - faint seyfert 2s to facilitate comparisons within the ir - faint sample , and to that end , the ir - luminous seyfert 1 dynamical values from rvs05c have been scaled up to a 5 kpc radius as well .",
    "these results should be considered order - of - magnitude estimates since they are based on a number of largely unproven assumptions .",
    "we have not listed all results here ; selected results can be seen in figure  [ dmdtplots ] .    for the objects in the present study , we assume a modest value of 0.3 for the large - scale opening angle ( c_@xmath70 ) , which is the typical value for local disk winds @xcite . following the method of rvs05b , the covering fraction is used to parameterize the clumpiness of the wind , or it may reflect the global solid angle subtended by the wind when viewed from the galactic center . using the value of @xmath71c_f@xmath38@xmath72 as listed in table  [ avgpropout ]",
    ", this yields a global covering factor of @xmath73 @xmath5 0.1 for both seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s .",
    "these values are not well constrained , especially for the seyfert 1s since only one outflow was detected in this type of seyfert .",
    "the @xmath73 value is inconsistent with values of @xmath73 @xmath5 0.5 - 1.0 calculated by crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2003b ) from uv absorption lines in local seyfert 1s .",
    "this low @xmath73 value could imply that the winds we are seeing are collimated rather than wide - angle , and thus our lack of outflow detection in some of these objects may be due to their orientation relative to us rather than a complete lack of neutral gas outflow .",
    "the influence of host galaxy inclination on column density was explored using extinction - corrected axis ratios from the de vaucouleurs third reference catalog @xcite , but no conclusion could be drawn due to small - number statistics . additionally , these @xmath73 values will be low in comparison to values from other studies ; there is contribution here from the background galaxy , and many of the outflows we have found are small - scale .",
    "comparisons with the results of uv absorption line studies should be considered with caution , though , since uv absorbers are typically of much higher ionization ( , ) and likely located much closer to the agn than  d  absorbing material .",
    "the  d  absorbers may also be affected more strongly by host galaxy contamination than the uv absorbers .",
    "blueshifted absorption lines have also been detected in x - ray spectra for a number of seyfert galaxies , including mrk 6 , with column densities of significantly higher order of magnitude than we have found here for  d  in the optical ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "again , we caution comparing these results with our own , as it has been noted that these x - ray lines are much higher ionization ( , ) and are often intrinsically related to the aforementioned uv absorption lines .",
    "one particularly interesting dynamical quantity is the mass outflow rate , since galactic outflows may contribute to the igm enrichment and are possibly a quencher of star formation @xcite .",
    "plots of @xmath74 for the ir - faint seyferts , ir - luminous seyferts , and starbursting lirgs and ulirgs from rvs05b and rvs05c , and the dwarfs of schwartz & martin ( all calculations are based on a absorber radius of 5 kpc ) are presented in figure  [ dmdtplots ] .",
    "we see a general trend of mass outflow rate increasing with both l_@xmath25  and galactic mass .",
    "there is a considerable difference in the mean @xmath74 rates between ir - luminous seyfert 1s and ir - luminous seyfert 2s .",
    "the momentum and energy , as well as outflow rates for those quantities , are also significantly higher for ir - luminous seyfert 1s than ir - luminous seyfert 2s and all ir - faint seyferts .",
    "the overall good agreement in detection rate and kinematics between ir - faint and ir - bright seyfert 2s and starburst ulirgs & lirgs ( figures  [ detrateplots]-[dmdtplots ] ) suggests that the outflows in all of these objects are powered by star formation , while the marked differences when ir - faint seyfert 1 galaxies are considered suggest that the agn plays an important role in driving the ( generally high velocity ) outflows in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "escape fractions were not calculated here since too few objects have outflow velocity components .",
    "we can also look at energy outflow rates in order to determine what role these outflows could play in galactic feedback .",
    "the rates that we have calculated can be found in table  [ outindiv ] , though it must be cautioned that these numbers are a function of our uncertain @xmath73 value , as well as our assumed absorber radius of 5 kpc .",
    "for the seyfert 2 outflows , the average energy outflow rate was found to be @xmath5 10@xmath75 @xmath76  @xmath77  ergs s@xmath7 , or @xmath5",
    "10@xmath78 @xmath76  @xmath77  l_@xmath3 . in comparison to the average bolometric luminosity for these objects",
    "( @xmath5 10@xmath79 l_@xmath3 , taken from @xcite ) , the energy outflow rates are only @xmath51% of the host galaxy luminosity .",
    "this indicates that outflow energetics in our seyfert 2 galaxies are not strong enough to play a large role in galactic feedback .",
    "the findings of schlesinger et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for mrk 573 are in agreement with our conclusion . for the only seyfert 1 galaxy that we have found to have an outflow , mrk 6 , the energy outflow rate of its lower velocity component ( 10@xmath80 @xmath76  @xmath77  ergs s@xmath7 ) is again @xmath51% of the host bolometric luminosity .",
    "this indicates that this seyfert 1 outflow is also not energetic enough to play a vital role in galactic feedback , and thus previous findings are consistent with our results @xcite .",
    "if we look at the higher velocity outflow found in mrk 6 , its energy outflow rate ( 10@xmath81 @xmath76  @xmath77  ergs s@xmath7 ) is @xmath55% of the host bolometric luminosity , which is higher than for the seyfert 2 galaxies but again likely not strong enough to influence the evolution of its environment .",
    "however , one should note that these values are all highly dependent on the calculated value of @xmath73 and assumed value of @xmath82 and are thus uncertain in comparison to our measured velocities .",
    "an unexpected result of the present study is the high detection rate of inflows in ir - faint seyferts ( 39% @xmath64 12% for seyfert 1s , 35% @xmath64 11% for seyfert 2s ) .",
    "in contrast , only @xmath515% of the ir - luminous objects in rvs05b and rvs05c showed redshifted  d  absorption .",
    "this difference is clearly seen in the left panel of figure  [ velhistplots ] .",
    "interestingly , a recent search for outflows in the aegis database has also revealed an excess of inflows among agn - powered systems @xcite .",
    "inflow has been observed in at least one seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc 5548 , using ionized gas detected in the uv , though detections have not been reported for such a large number of objects as we have found here @xcite .",
    "there has been one tentative observation of redshifted x - ray absorption in a seyfert 1 galaxy , but the authors caution that the significance of the absorption line they have measured is highly uncertain @xcite .    when we examine the inflow data on the ir - faint galaxies alone , we find no significant correlation between v_max@xmath49  and galactic mass ( left panel in figure  [ inplots ] ) .",
    "neither is there any obvious trend with seyfert type or far - infrared luminosity ( right panel of figure  [ inplots ] ) , in contrast to the trends seen for the outflowing gas .",
    "additionally , we see inflows in nearly the same fraction of seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s , indicating no particular trend with seyfert type . as for the detected outflows ,",
    "the influence of host galaxy inclination on column density was explored using extinction - corrected axis ratios @xcite , but again , no conclusion could be drawn due to small - number statistics .    next , the velocity distributions of the inflowing components for the ir - faint and ir - luminous seyfert 1 galaxies were combined together and compared with the combined distribution of ir - faint and ir - luminous seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "k - s and kuiper tests were performed on @xmath47 , v_max@xmath49 , and doppler parameter , following the same procedure as in section [ outdisc ] , and the results are listed in table  [ stattests2c ] .",
    "they confirm the lack of obvious differences in the inflow properties between the two types of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the  absorption infall velocities often extend to relatively high values so we favor a nuclear location for this gas rather than a galactic origin ( e.g. galactic fountains , @xcite ) . nuclear accretion of cool gas like  with t  @xmath5  100",
    "k can provide fuel not only for star formation but also for nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed to help reduce the large angular momentum of the gas in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "these include nuclear ( @xmath19 1 kpc ) bars and spirals @xcite and gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies @xcite .",
    "nuclear bars are thought to form when a large galactic bar forces gas inwards , creating a gaseous disk , and instability causes formation of a small gas bar near the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "stellar bars could also accomplish the same thing .",
    "both bar types are capable of removing angular momentum from gas rotating near the nucleus @xcite .",
    "nuclear spirals have been proposed as another agn fueling mechanism since shock fronts that occur at their boundaries can take away angular momentum from local gas and cause material to fall in towards the black hole @xcite .",
    "however , these nuclear structures do not necessarily lead to agn fueling since they are present in a equally large fraction of non - active galaxies @xcite .",
    "star formation may occur in these objects and disrupt agn - fueling inflows @xcite .",
    "we revisit this issue here by looking for the presence of nuclear spirals or bars in the ir - faint seyfert galaxies with inflow signature .",
    "we have compared our results to nuclear structure surveys done by three different groups @xcite .",
    "nuclear dust structures in objects in common with these studies are classified into five distinct morphological categories ( see column ( 11 ) of table  [ objprop ] ) : irregular dust , dust filaments , nuclear dust ring , nuclear dust bar , and nuclear dust spiral . of the thirteen objects which show inflows , five show evidence for nuclear dust spirals , bars , or rings , one shows evidence for dust filaments , one for irregular dust , and six show no sign of nuclear dust structure .",
    "the significant fraction of objects that show both inflows and nuclear dust spirals , bars , rings , and/or filaments lends credence to the idea of a connection between morphology and kinematics . of the seven objects with irregular dust or no dust , five have nearby companion galaxies ,",
    "so tidal forces due to interactions with these companions may cause agn fueling @xcite .",
    "this leaves only two objects with inflow which do not show nuclear structure or a companion : akn  202 and mrk  1018 .",
    "there are also two objects in our study with nuclear dust structure that show measurable _ outflow _ rather than inflow ( ngc  3786 and ngc  7319 ) , and thus whether we measure outflow rather than inflow may be a consequence of our line of sight to the nucleus ( inflow and outflow may be occurring in different planes , or in the same plane but over a different range of azimuthal angles ) , rather than a lack of inflow in the object .",
    "measurements of the line - of - sight velocity field with a resolution of @xmath510s of pc will be needed to disentangle the geometry of the inflows / outflows detected in our data ( e.g. , the study of ngc  1097 by @xcite ) .",
    "the same method used to calculate mass , momentum , and kinetic energy for outflows ( section [ mme ] ) was used for inflows , but the characteristic absorber radius was reduced to 1 kpc , a rough upper limit to the scale of the circumnuclear structures ( nuclear bars / spirals ) believed to be responsible for feeding the agn ( section [ nuc ] , @xcite ) .",
    "again , these dynamical quantities are rather uncertain , but are calculated to find out at least roughly how these inflows compare with the mass accretion rates necessary to power the agn in these systems .",
    "table  [ inindiv ] lists the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy calculated for all objects with measured inflows . the mass accretion rate for these inflows ranges from just under 1 @xmath83  m _",
    "^-1m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  to just under 5 @xmath83  m _  ^-1m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 . for comparison , the mass accretion rate needed to power",
    "an agn is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the bolometric luminosity of the agn , @xmath86 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath87 is the speed of light , and @xmath88 is an efficiency factor dictating how much of the rest mass of the material being accreted is turned into radiation . if we take @xmath88 to be @xmath89 0.1 @xcite and allow the bolometric luminosity to be @xmath5 10@xmath90 ergs s@xmath7 , typical for seyfert galaxies @xcite , then we find that a mass accretion rate of @xmath86  @xmath5  10@xmath91 m _  ^-1m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  is required .",
    "even with our rough order of magnitude estimates , the mass accretion rates of all of our observed  d  inflows are well above the amount necessary to power the agn .",
    "thus the inflows that we are measuring carry enough material to fuel the agn in these objects , even if only @xmath51% of this material makes its way down to the agn .",
    "the total infalling mass of @xmath5  10@xmath78 @xmath83  m_@xmath92 , estimated from our data , is enough to sustain nuclear activity over typical agn lifetimes ( @xmath93 yrs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main results from our study of  d  absorption in infrared - faint seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies can be summarized as follows :    * _ outflow detection rates and kinematics : _ the rates of detection of outflows in ir - faint seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are lower than previously found in ir - bright seyferts .",
    "outflows were found in @xmath518% of ir - faint seyfert 2s in our sample , compared with @xmath545% among the seyfert 2 ulirgs of rvs05c .",
    "only one out of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample shows evidence for a wind , far lower than the @xmath550% reported for seyfert 1 ulirgs in rvs05c .",
    "interestingly , the outflow detection rate and velocities of ir - faint seyferts follow the same trends with infrared luminosity and galaxy mass as ir - bright systems .",
    "the outflow kinematics of seyfert 2 galaxies resemble those of starburst galaxies , while the outflow velocities in seyfert 1 galaxies are significantly larger .",
    "these results suggest that the agn is contributing to the neutral outflows in seyfert 1 systems , while the starburst is the main driver of the outflows in all seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "differences in wind angular extent ( e.g. agn - driven outflows in seyfert 1s are more collimated than starburst - driven outflows ) may also explain some of these results . * _ outflow dynamical estimates : _ the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy of the material involved in these outflows were estimated assuming a constant characteristic radius of 5 kpc . the dynamical properties of the outflows in seyfert 2 galaxies are similar to those of the starburst ulirgs & lirgs , but differ significantly from those of the seyfert 1s .",
    "this again suggests a fundamental physical difference between the outflows of seyfert 1s and those in the other objects .",
    "an attempt to determine the influence of host galaxy inclination on these outflows was inconclusive . measured energetic rates do not appear large enough to play a significant role in galactic feedback , but these values are uncertain . * _ inflow detection rates and kinematics : _ a striking result of this study is the high rate of detection of spatially - unresolved redshifted  d  absorption , which we interpret as nuclear inflows ( 39% and 35% inflow detection rates for seyfert 2s and 1s ) , with maximum velocities ( 321 and 291 km  s@xmath7  on average ) .",
    "this is evidence for the existence of some mechanism capable of removing angular momentum from the circumnuclear gas in these objects .",
    "nuclear bars and spirals , as well as interactions with nearby galaxies , may play a role in this process . * _ inflow dynamical estimates : _ mass , momentum , and kinetic energy were estimated for the inflows , using a characteristic radius of 1 kpc , consistent with the observed sizes of nuclear bars and spirals in these systems . while these estimates are uncertain , we find that the total infalling mass and infalling mass rates are more than enough to power the agn in these systems for typical agn lifetimes . as with the outflows , an attempt was made to determine the influence of inclination on column density , but no conclusion could be drawn .",

    "<S> taken together , these results suggest that the agn does not play a significant role in driving the outflows in most infrared - faint and infrared - bright systems , except the high - velocity outflows seen in seyfert 1 galaxies . another striking result of this study is the high rate of detection of inflows in infrared - faint galaxies ( 39% of seyfert 1s , 35% of seyfert 2s ) , significantly larger than in infrared - luminous seyferts ( 15% ) . </S>",
