    "the jaynes  cummings ( jc ) model is a fundamental building block in quantum optics ; it describes the interaction of a qubit with a quantum electromagnetic field under long wave and rotating wave approximations .",
    "it is exactly solvable @xcite and has proven useful to describe phenomena as rabi oscillations @xcite and collapse and revivals of the atomic inversion @xcite , among others ; see  @xcite for a review on the model . if the number of qubits increases , the model , known as the dicke or tavis  cummings model , shows many - body phenomena in the form of a superradiant phase @xcite .",
    "the dicke model is also exactly solvable @xcite and is known to show super - fluorescence and amplified spontaneous emission ; see  @xcite for a recent review .    in recent years , a general dicke hamiltonian , including quadratic self - interactions on both the field and qubit ensemble was introduced to study the effect of the nonlinearities and their relation to the stark shift , in units of @xmath0 , @xmath1 in this model the frequencies for the field and two - level system transitions are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the quadratic interactions are assumed to be equal and given by @xmath4 , while the coupling between field and qubit is given by the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "an exact solution to this system was found by quantum inverse methods involving bethe anzats  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the dicke model and its generalizations lies in its ability to describe more than atoms interacting with the quantized field of a cavity ; i.e. lasers .",
    "for example , it may describe open dynamical cavity - qed systems  @xcite , ion trap systems  @xcite , circuit - qed systems  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates interacting with classical or quantized electromagnetic fields  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we present an exact solution , up to the roots of a polynomial , to a more general dicke hamiltonian by considering non - identical nonlinear interactions in ( [ eq : hbogoliubov ] ) . in the following",
    ", we will discuss our general dicke hamiltonian and the physical systems it can describe .",
    "we then show how a novel right unitary transform involving susskind ",
    "glogower operators helps us diagonalize the hamiltonian in the field basis . with this at hand",
    ", it is simple to diagonalize the resulting tridiagonal hamiltonian in the dicke basis via orthogonal polynomials satisfying a three - term recurrence relation . in order to verify the validity of our exact solution",
    ", we recover the time evolution for a system involving just the single qubit . finally ,",
    "we study the time evolution of different ensemble sizes to illustrate the simplicity of our approach and the results it yields ; we focus on the population inversion dynamics of the qubit ensemble as well as the evolution of the entropy and q - function of the field .",
    "let us consider a system composed by an ensemble of @xmath6 identical two - level systems ( ` qubits ' ) that interact with each other .",
    "these qubitas are in the presence of a quantized field and a kerr medium . for the sake of simplicity , we move into the frame defined by the transformation @xmath7 , where the excitation number operator is given by @xmath8 , and work with the hamiltonian in units of @xmath0 , @xmath9 the qubits ensemble is described by collective dicke operators satisfying the @xmath10 algebra , @xmath11 = 2 \\hat{j}_{z}$ ] , @xmath12 = \\pm \\hat{j}_{\\pm}$ ] , while the annihilation and creation operators for a single mode field satisfy @xmath13=1 $ ] .",
    "the transition frequency of each qubit , @xmath14 , and the frequency of the field , @xmath15 , are summarized by the detuning @xmath16 .",
    "the kerr medium is described by the parameter @xmath17 , while the qubit - qubit and ensemble - field couplings are given by @xmath4 and @xmath18 , in that order .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) describes the @xmath6-atom maser in general . in the special case of equal self - interactions , @xmath19",
    ", it can be transformed into the @xmath6-atom maser including , kerr nonlinearity and stark shift as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "different parameter sets describe particular physical models ; e.g.,@xmath20 delivers the kerr model  @xcite , @xmath21 yield the dicke or tavis  cummings model  @xcite and @xmath22 gives the micromaser with kerr nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the general hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and its reductions are experimentally feasible in cavity- and circuit - qed as well as trapped ions .",
    "it may also be possible to realize some of these models with two - mode bose - einstein condensates coupled to radiation fields  @xcite .",
    "the case of equal - self interactions , @xmath19 , has been solved by inverse quantum methods in the past @xcite .",
    "this solution involves the bethe ansatz method .",
    "the general hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can also be solved by extending our right unitary approach to the quantum landau  zener problem for a single two - level system presented in  @xcite , which delivers an evolution operator with the form @xmath23 where the auxiliary hamiltonians are given by @xmath24 where the ket @xmath25 is a dicke state , the operator @xmath26 is the density matrix for the pure state of the field with @xmath27 photons , the operator @xmath28 is the photon number operator and the symbol @xmath29 represents kronecker delta .",
    "these auxiliary hamiltonians are diagonal in the field basis ; i.e. they are given in terms of the photon number functions @xmath30^{1/2 } \\left [ \\hat{n } + 1 + \\frac{n}{2 } - j \\right]^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is , however , a simpler approach to solve this general radiation - matter interaction model .",

[ fig : fig2 ] , and twenty five , fig . [ fig : fig3 ] , qubits .",
    "the information about the particular initial conditions and parameter values can be found in the figures and their captions . at the time , it is not our goal to report and in - depth analysis of the dynamics of generalized dicke models but just to present our diagonalization scheme to obtain an exact solution via susskind - glogower operators . for this reason",
    ", we will just briefly comment some basic characteristics of the dynamics . by considering an initial state given by the separable state consisting of a coherent field and the ensemble in its ground state , @xmath68 , it is possible to see that the dicke model presents strong collapse and revivals of the population inversion as long as the mean photon number is larger than the number of qubits in the system . a clear collapse of the population inversion is seen in any case studied here , up to @xmath69 .",
    "the strength of the oscillations in the population inversion diminishes as the number of qubits in the system gets close to the mean photon number of the coherent state but they become ever - present at smaller times as we get larger ensemble sizes for a fixed value of the coherent state parameter .",
    "meanwhile , the purity and entropy of such a dicke model signals an ever - present entangled state between the field and the ensemble as the number of qubits gets close to or equal to the mean number of photons ; i.e. the plots change from strong , well - defined , unmodulated dips in the functions to a strongly modulated flat - liner close to the value of a mixed reduced density matrix  @xcite .",

    "well - defined phase blobs appear and evolve half of them clock - wise and the other half counter - clock - wise as time goes by .",
    "the revivals in the population inversion are associated to the overlapping of these phase blobs ; a stronger revival corresponding to a better overlapping .    however , when an interacting ensemble of qubits is considered under dicke  kerr dynamics , the collapse and revivals of the population inversion are always weak but well defined and periodical .",
    "purity and entropy functions point a return to a quasi - separable state on the first revival for the cases analyzed with the number of qubits less or equal to the mean photon number of the field .",
