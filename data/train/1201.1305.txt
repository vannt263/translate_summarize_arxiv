    "it is further worthwhile to note that , while conservative models of the dark star contribution to the ebl do not strongly constrain wimp properties such as mass or annihilation cross section , this picture can change when our prior assumptions are relaxed : as outlined in @xcite , the dark star luminosity - to - mass ratio - and therefore the peak ebl contribution ( see eqn .",

    "the dark star induced ebl component is unique in that it is not sensitive to the exact branching ratios of the annihilation yields into photons or charged particles and their resulting spectra , as all annihilation products ( with the exception of neutrinos , of course ) are trapped and thermalized within the dark star . in this regard , the calculations presented here can also serve as an independent and complementary template for indirect dark matter searches in other wave bands .    implications also exist regarding the elastic scattering cross section of the dark matter particles .",
    "as capture via elastic scattering is a dominant channel for replenishing the fuel of the dark star ( see e.g. @xcite ) , once equilibrium has been reached the luminosity of such a star scales linearly with the wimp - proton scattering cross - section ( hydrogen of course being the dominant target for an assumed primordial mixture ) .",
    "there is considerable discussion ongoing with regard to experimental searches for elastic wimp - nucleon scattering in underground experiments .    with respect to dark stars",
    ", it is interesting that , again assuming the basic setup from @xcite , a spin - dependent wimp - proton cross section of the order 1pb for a wimp with a rest mass of tens of gev would already result in dark stars with lmrs very close to the `` max '' value of table [ table : parameters ] . while backing up the constraints down to the multiple - femtobarn level from the non - detection of annihilation neutrinos from the sun @xcite , the as of yet definitive missing detection of a dark star contribution to the ebl therefore reinforces the conclusion that spin - dependent scattering can reconcile the dama and cogent measurements of an annual modulation of event rates @xcite with null - results from other experiments only for cases in which the wimp - neutron cross - section is several orders of magnitude greater than the wimp - proton cross section , as e.g. discussed in @xcite .",
    "it should however be noted that for the case of light dark matter particles , there exist windows where a surprisingly high spin - independent scattering cross section of the order @xmath94 is compatible with the dama / libra and cogent measurements @xcite .",
