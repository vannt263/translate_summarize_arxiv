    "our knowledge about the structure functions of the nucleon is still incomplete because of lack of understanding how these structure functions behave in the small bjorken @xmath2 region .",
    "neither present experimental data nor the theoretical qcd description give a full and unique picture of an exact shape of the quark and gluon distributions in the nucleon .",
    "perturbative qcd analysis , based on the glap evolution equations @xcite is in a good agreement with experimental measurements .",
    "this agreement concerns unpolarized @xcite , @xcite and polarized @xcite structure functions of the nucleon within nlo approximation in the large and moderatory small bjorken @xmath2 region .",
    "unfortunately , practically lack of experimental data in the small @xmath2 region ( @xmath4 ) makes the satisfactory determination of the bjorken and ellis - jaffe sum rules @xcite impossible .",
    "this causes e.g. that the question `` how is the spin of the nucleon made of partons ? ''",
    "remains still open . from recent papers @xcite , @xcite we know , that the small @xmath2 behaviour of both unpolarized and polarized structure functions is controlled by the double logarithmic terms @xmath5",
    "however , this singular behaviour of the structure functions at low @xmath2 is better visible in the spin dependent case . for the unpolarized , nonsinglet structure function @xmath6 the qcd singular behaviour at small @xmath2",
    "is overridden by the leading regge contribution @xcite .",
    "next in the unpolarized , singlet case , the structure function at low @xmath2 is driven by bfkl pomeron @xcite because gluons play the dominant role .",
    "thus the growth of structure functions of the nucleon , governed by leading double logarithmic terms @xmath7 becomes best visible for spin dependent functions .",
    "therefore the polarized structure functions of the nucleon may be a sensitive test of the perturbative qcd analyses in the small @xmath2 region .",
    "the double logarithmic @xmath8 effects go beyond the standard lo or even nlo qcd evolution of parton distributions and correspond to the ladder diagrams with quark and gluon exchanges along the ladder .",
    "one has also to take into account nonladder diagrams but in the nonsinglet case they may be neglected as nonleading @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus the nonsinglet , polarized structure function @xmath9 is a convenient function both for qcd analyses ( because of its simplicity ) and future experimental tests at hera @xcite concerning the determination of the bjorken sum rule .",
    "theoretical predictions for @xmath1 at small @xmath2 , incorporating the double @xmath8 effects have been presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these papers",
    "the perturbative qcd analysis is based on the unintegrated spin dependent quark distributions @xmath10 .",
    "it means that the sum of double logarithmic @xmath8 terms is represented by a appropriate integral equation for the unintegrated structure function @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we present an alternative approach of the double @xmath8 resummation for @xmath1 at small @xmath2 .",
    "our formalism is based on the usual quark distribution functions ( and not on @xmath10 function ) and moreover generates the @xmath8 terms via glap - like evolution equation for the rescaled quark transverse momentum squared @xmath11 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare these two methods of the double @xmath8 resummation for the polarized nonsinglet structure function @xmath1 at low @xmath2 . in the next section we briefly recall the origin of the double logarithmic @xmath8 effects at low @xmath2 , incorporating the evolution equation based on the unintegrated function @xmath10 . in section 3",
    "we introduce alternative formalism , in which after rescaling the kinematic variable @xmath11 we get glap - like evolution equation in @xmath12 .",
    "this equation for the polarized quark distributions ( and hence for the @xmath1 function ) generates the double logarithmic @xmath8 terms .",
    "section 4 contains numerical results for the spin dependent nonsinglet structure function @xmath13 in our approach .",
    "we compare the both mentioned above methods and also compare their predictions for @xmath1 with smc 1997 small @xmath2 data . finally in section 5",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "it has been lately noticed @xcite , @xcite that the spin dependent structure function @xmath14 in the small @xmath2 region is dominated by @xmath15 terms .",
    "this singular behaviour , implied by qcd is for the polarized structure functions the leading one .",
    "comparatively , for unpolarized , nonsinglet structure functions of the nucleon , the qcd evolution behaviour at small @xmath2 is screened by the leading regge contribution .",
    "the regge theory @xcite , which concerns the regge limit : @xmath16 predicts the following behaviour of parton distributions at small @xmath2 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 denote respectively singlet unpolarized , nonsinglet unpolarized , singlet polarized , nonsinglet polarized quark distributions .",
    "the shape of all spin dependent distributions @xmath21 , @xmath22 is mostly governed by qcd evolutions with dominating @xmath8 terms at small @xmath2 .",
    "these @xmath8 contributions correspond to the ladder diagram with quark and gluon exchanges along the ladder - _ cf _ fig.1 .",
    "terms in the nonsinglet spin structure function @xmath14.,width=302 ]    in contrast to the singlet polarized function , for the nonsinglet one the contribution of nonladder diagrams is negligible . thus examing the polarized , nonsinglet structure function @xmath13 , we should consider only mentioned above ladder diagrams .",
    "the nonsinglet part of the spin dependent structure function has a form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are spin dependent structure functions of proton and neutron respectively .",
    "let us remind the meaning of @xmath14 . in the bjorken limit @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a charge of the i - flavour quark ,",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 is the density distribution function of the i - quark with the spin parallel ( antiparallel ) to the parent nucleon .",
    "function @xmath31 is connected with the helicity of the nucleon ( _ i.e. _ spin projection on the momentum direction ) .",
    "thus the integral @xmath32 is simply a part of the nucleon helicity , carried by a quark of i - flavour ( i = u , d , s , .. ) .",
    "polarized distribution functions of quarks are defined as : @xmath33 finally : @xmath34 solutions of the equation for the unintegrated polarized nonsinglet structure function @xmath35 , which gives the @xmath8 resummation are presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 as the only contribution at small @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath1 is examined in @xcite while in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the unified description of @xmath1 incorporating both gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( glap ) evolution and @xmath8 effects is presented .",
    "these all approaches are based on the unintegrated distribution function @xmath36 , which is related to the @xmath31 via @xmath37 where @xmath38 let us recall from @xcite that the resummation of the double logarithmic terms @xmath8 in the limit of a very small @xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) is given in the case of the polarized , nonsinglet structure function by : @xmath39 the source of the double logarithmic terms @xmath8 in @xmath31 is the double integration in the formula for function @xmath10 : @xmath40 where the upper limit in the integral over the transverse momentum @xmath41 is @xmath42-dependent ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "thus , double logarithmic terms come from the integration over the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath42 together with the integration over @xmath41 with @xmath42-dependent upper limit : @xmath44 the analytical solution of ( [ r2.10 ] ) in the case of the fixed coupling constant @xmath45 @xcite shows the singular small @xmath2 behaviour of the polarized , nonsinglet structure function @xmath14 _ i.e. _ : @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the splitting function and in the limit @xmath16 is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "hence for the fixed @xmath45=0.18 , @xmath50 and as it has been already mentioned above , the singular small @xmath2 shape of @xmath1 , implied by qcd dominates the regge behaviour : @xmath51 @xmath52 in the case of the running coupling constant , numerical results for @xmath1 , based on the regge flat input parametrization @xmath53 are given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite the same method is used for dynamical input parametrization , where in contrast to regge flat parametrizations , @xmath53 is singular for small @xmath2 .",
    "the generation of the double logarithmic @xmath8 terms is also possible via glap - like evolution equation for @xmath14 function with the rescaled transverse momentum squared .",
    "this alternative method is presented in the next section .",
    "we study the origin of the double logarithmic @xmath8 terms in @xmath13 using a simple rescaling of @xmath3 variable : @xmath54 , what leads to the glap - like equation for @xmath1 with evolution in a new scale @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on the small @xmath2 region so our initial equation for further investigations is that which contains only dominating @xmath8 part .",
    "first let us consider the case with a fixed coupling @xmath55 , where @xmath56 thus the starting equation is : @xmath57 after a simple substitution : @xmath58 the equation ( [ r3.2 ] ) takes a form : @xmath59 after introduction an auxiliary function @xmath60 : @xmath61 and applying heaviside s @xmath62 function : @xmath63 we get : @xmath64 or @xmath65 where @xmath66 the equation ( [ r3.8 ] ) has an exact form of the glap @xmath3 evolution formula for the unintegrated distribution function @xmath36 .",
    "the mentioned glap evolution equation for polarized nonsinglet quark distributions @xmath67 ( and hence for @xmath1 function too ) in the small @xmath2 region is given by : @xmath68 relation between @xmath69 and the unintegrated distribution @xmath70 is as usual : @xmath71 what implies : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a nonperturbative part of @xmath67 : @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the low scale of perturbative qcd .",
    "hence the evolution equation ( [ r3.10 ] ) written for the unintegrated distribution function @xmath70 takes a form : @xmath76 and @xmath77 one can see from ( [ r3.8 ] ) and ( [ r3.14 ] ) that the double @xmath8 resummation equation written for @xmath78 function is a glap @xmath12 evolution equation .",
    "the auxiliary function @xmath78 may be , similarly as in ( [ r3.11 ] ) , represented by an integrated function @xmath79 : @xmath80 and conversely : @xmath81 thus the equation ( [ r3.8 ] ) , generating double @xmath8 effects can be rewritten as : @xmath82 relation between the nonsinglet polarized structure function @xmath13 and the auxiliary function @xmath79 is as follows : @xmath83 in this way the problem of producing the @xmath8 terms for @xmath13 in the small @xmath2 region via equation ( [ r2.10 ] ) has been reduced to the glap evolution to the momentum scale @xmath84 .",
    "it is not astonishing : appearing of the new evolution scale @xmath85 has its origin in the upper limit @xmath86 of the integration over the transverse momentum in ( [ r2.10 ] ) .",
    "this logarithmic integration over the transverse momentum up to the @xmath87dependent limit @xmath86 together with the logarithmic integration over the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath42 give double logarithmic @xmath88 terms .",
    "the mechanism of appearing of the @xmath88 effects in @xmath1 from glap - like equations ( [ r3.18])-([r3.19 ] ) is well visible just in a case of the fixed coupling constant @xmath55 .",
    "then the eq.([r3.18 ] ) can be solved analytically .",
    "using standard mellin s method one can get the solution of eq.([r3.18 ] ) in the form ( see appendix a ) : @xmath89 and hence : @xmath90^k}{k!k!}\\ ] ] what gives approximately the leading small @xmath2 behaviour : @xmath91 taking into account parton interactions through the introduction of the running coupling constant one can get from ( [ r3.18 ] ) an equation which incorporates the running couplings effects @xmath92 : @xmath93 however more justified theoretically seems the introduction of the running coupling by the substitution @xmath94 , what gives : @xmath95 our numerical analysis presented in the next section contains the both above `` running coupling '' prescriptions and the constant @xmath96 case as well .",
    "we solve numerically equations ( [ r3.18 ] ) , ( [ r3.23 ] ) and ( [ r3.24 ] ) which are glap @xmath12 evolution equations for the auxiliary function @xmath79 .",
    "the relation between @xmath79 and the physical polarized nonsinglet structure function @xmath13 ( [ r2.7 ] ) is given by ( [ r3.19 ] ) . in this way one can get the small @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath1 governed by the double logarithmic @xmath8 effects .",
    "our predictions we compare with those , received in the unintegrated @xmath36 approach ( [ r2.10 ] ) and described in @xcite . solving the glap equations ( [ r3.18 ] ) ,",
    "( [ r3.23 ] ) and ( [ r3.24 ] ) one should have an input parametrization of the @xmath97 function at the low scale @xmath98 . because @xmath99 has a meaning of the physical @xmath1 function for the rescaled @xmath3 variable as it is shown in ( [ r3.19 ] )",
    ", one can also write : @xmath100",
    "the low scale @xmath98 introduced in ( [ r3.7 ] ) is equal to the usually used qcd cut - off parameter @xmath101 .",
    "the really dependence on @xmath102 of the lower limit in the integration ( [ r3.4 ] ) : @xmath103 became `` shifted '' to the definition of @xmath78 via ( [ r3.9 ] ) .",
    "it means that for running coupling cases one should take into account in the evolution equations ( [ r3.23 ] ) and ( [ r3.24 ] ) the cut - off factor @xmath104 . otherwise , the running variable @xmath105 in the coupling @xmath45 becomes less than the low scale of qcd evolution @xmath101 what is definitely incorrect .",
    "there is no such a constraint in the fixed coupling constant .",
    "taking into account that for perturbative qcd analysis the low cut - off parameter @xmath101 we put this value for the input scale of the @xmath97 function too .",
    "this implies that for small @xmath2 the input parametrizations @xmath106 corresponds to the @xmath1 at the very low scale @xmath107 .",
    "we assume , that below the @xmath101 the behaviour of the quark distributions is the same as at @xmath98 .",
    "therefore we apply the standard parametrizations of the valence quarks ( and hence of @xmath1 ) for the auxiliary function @xmath97 : @xmath108 there are two basic kinds of input parametrizations of @xmath109 : the regge one , which is flat at small @xmath2 and the singular one , which behaves like @xmath110 at small @xmath2 . in our numerical calculations we use two different input parametrizations : the regge one , which is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the axial vector coupling and the dynamical input grsv @xcite : @xmath113 for details about these parametrizations see also @xcite . in all calculations @xmath114 .",
