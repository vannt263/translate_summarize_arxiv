    "we consider a prototype dg misfet as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the device is made from a si slab with thickness of nm order in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the channel ( @xmath3 ) direction is chosen along si crystal @xmath4 $ ] orientation and the interfaces along @xmath5 which is the preferred direction due to lower interface defect density and higher mobility .",
    "h atoms are used to passivate the dangling si bonds on the surfaces .",
    "the h - si bond length is relaxed and has a value of 1.49   while the si - si bond length is 2.35  .",
    "further on either side of the si slab a metal gate of variable length along @xmath3 direction is located a few angstroms away from the h atom sheet , as indicated by the thick solid bars in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . note that here we insert the vacuum slabs , instead of oxide slabs , between the gates and the si slab as the insulator .",
    "this is one of the simplifications introduced in this model in order to reduce the computation load .",
    "since the dielectric constant of vacuum ( @xmath6 ) is much lower than that of oxide ( e.g. @xmath7 for sio@xmath0 ) , we expect a lower insulator capacitance ( between the gate and the channel ) in our model and , hence , a larger gate threshold than that for devices with oxide insulator slabs .",
    "four different model structures of total length 21.72   are studied in this paper and they are denoted as @xmath8 for models with short gate ( length @xmath9  ) and @xmath10 for the model with long gate ( in the full central region of length @xmath11  ) .",
    "the index @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is used to distinguish models with different thickness of the si slab ( vacuum slab ) .",
    "the si slab in the models is @xmath12 unit - cells thick ( @xmath9 and @xmath11   for @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding vacuum slab thickness is @xmath16 and @xmath17   for @xmath18 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "another simplification is to approximate the gate effect with a boundary condition based on the following physical consideration .",
    "when we apply a small voltage drop between the si slab and the metal gates we shift the fermi energy in the latter by letting the former grounded . due to the high electron density in metal , the electrostatic potential in the gates will shift in parallel with the gate fermi energy or the voltage drop . as a result ,",
    "the role of the metal gates on the channel is to control the electrostatic boundary of the supercell as enclosed by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . understanding this gating mechanism",
    ", we can exclude the gate materials from our model system ( inside the supercell ) while taking its most important effect into account by shifting the boundary condition as further explained in next section .",
    "a third simplification is to use the same material for the source / drain electrodes and the channel . in real misfet devices , the drain and source electrodes",
    "are doped and the contact between the electrodes and the channel adds to the complexity of the system and makes the result difficult to analyze . in this work , we focus on the gating effect in the channel region and it would be more practical to handle a simplified system . this simplification is expected not to affect the conclusion when the bias is low and has been used by other authors .",
    "@xcite    after the above simplifications , in our model , the double - gated misfet is a si slab with known electrostatic boundary and can be studied by the negf - dft method .",
    "the system is composed of a hydrogen passivated si slab and two vacuum slabs . along @xmath3 axis , as separated by the vertical dash lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the system is divided into three regions : the left electrode ( l ) the central region , or the channel region ( c ) , and the right electrode ( r ) . in @xmath3 direction ,",
    "the electrostatic potential of a si slab without gate is used as the boundary condition of the electrostatic potential on the left and right boundaries of the supercell .",
    "this implies that the left and right electrodes are assumed semi - infinite . in @xmath19 direction ,",
    "the periodic boundary condition is applied to assume an extending system in this direction . in @xmath2 direction ,",
    "the boundary is variable depending on the system size and the gate voltage and will be specified in the corresponding context .",
    "furthermore , we assume a uniform fermi level inside the supercell .",
    "this approximation is justified in case of small bias between the source and drain electrodes because the gate voltage induced variation of fermi energy happens mainly in the vacuum slab and the density of states there is negligible .",
    "( 300,240 ) ( 0,40 )      to analyze the electrostatic and transport properties of the atomic scale misfet , we utilize density functional theory ( dft ) , @xcite which converts the many - body system into a single - particle system , and the two - terminal nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) technique @xcite , which takes care of the coherent transport through the system between the source and the drain electrodes in landauer picture @xcite . with standard norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite to describe the effective interaction of the valence and core electrons , we construct a localized siesta linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) basis set @xmath20 @xcite as the representation for expanding the electronic wavefunctions . according to the hohenberg - kohn theorem , @xcite in the born - oppenheimer approximation , the fully interacting electron problem for the ground state can be mapped into a variational problem in terms of a single - particle density @xmath21 .",

    ", we use the supercell technique with the periodic boundary condition to define and solve the ks equation in the whole real space .",
    "the dimension of the supercell is chosen larger than the screening length of the ks potential in any direction so the real system is well mimicked by that inside the supercell . in open systems ,",

    "@xmath34 on the boundary is denoted as the boundary condition at @xmath35 .",
    "the boundary condition at finite @xmath36 is obtained by shifting @xmath34 with @xmath36 on the gate but keep the same as @xmath34 on the electrodes .",
    "on each boundary region between a electrode and a gate the potential shift decreases linearly from @xmath36 to zero . the modified boundary condition",
    "is then applied to the system to solve @xmath37 and @xmath38 at arbitrary @xmath36 . in the calculation we use the szp , single @xmath39 valence @xmath40 and @xmath41 orbitals ( @xmath40 orbitals ) plus single @xmath39-polarization @xmath42 ( @xmath41 ) orbitals for si ( h ) , real space siesta lcao basis set @xcite and the standard nonlocal norm - conserving pseudopotential @xcite from the database in atk",
    "the reason why we use the szp basis set instead of a simpler one is because the result presented in this paper converges for szp and more complete basis sets .",

    "in summary , we have proposed an atomistic multi - terminal model for electrostatic simulation of nano misfets in the framework of the negf - dft approach and studied the behaviour of devices with si slabs of one and two unit cells in thickness , with variable insulator ( vacuum in this model ) thickness , and with different gate length .",
    "the subthreshold region in terms of the surface potential reflects the band gap of the si slabs and the surface potential at the threshold points remains little changed in devices of different insulator thickness .",
    "for a device with thicker si slab , the subthreshold region in surface potential becomes narrower due to the quantum confinement effect while the subthreshold region in gate voltage becomes wider as a result of the competition between the confinement effect and the geometry effect on capacitance . in nano fets where the gate length is comparable to the insulator thickness , the short gate effect results in a much wider subthreshold region than that observed in conventional misfets .",
    "this short gate effect can be suppressed by using longer gates to reduce the fringe effect on the electric field in the insulator slab .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the band structure of si slabs with different thickness . the density of states and the transmission probability of electrons in our nano fet system",
    "are then estimated to demonstrate the quantum confinement effect and the gating effect on transport in the linear region .",
    "the energy gap widens and shifts to higher energy when the si slab varies from one to two unit - cells in thickness .",
    "the application of a gate voltage introduces energy barriers or wells to the carriers in the transport channel and modifies the performance the nano fets .",
    "a negative gate voltage favors the hole transport between the electrodes while a positive one favors the electron transport .",
    "limited to the computation capability , our model system is still not fully realistic and is smaller than even the latest feasible misfets @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our model may provide qualitative information about realistic misfets and serve as a prototype framework for nano misfet simulations .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the economic development board ( edb ) , singapore , and in part under the joint research collaboration agreement between nanyang technological university ( ntu ) and atomistix asia pacific pte ltd ( aap ) .",
    "support from the nanocluster and microelectronics center of ntu is also acknowledged .",
    "approaches of the dft and negf combination used in the literature can be different depending on the assumptions , the approximations , and the basis set used in specific cases . in the paper , we specify the approach we used in this work and refer the readers to the related references for detailed analysis and justification of the approach since it has been systematically described elsewhere ."
