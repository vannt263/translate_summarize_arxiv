    "transiting extrasolar planets are important because measurements of the planetary transits as well as the stellar reflex velocity provide both the mass and radius , and hence the density of the planet .",
    "in contrast to the relatively tight mass - radius relationship of main - sequence stars , the hot jupiters found in transit surveys exhibit a wide range of radii at each mass , thus additional parameters affect the radii of close - in gas giants . with over 100 transiting extrasolar planets now securely characterised statistics are beginning to support comparative studies to unravel the factors that determine their radii and orbit parameters . toward this goal",
    "it is important to extend the statistics of hot jupiters to smaller planets .",

    "pc , follow - up spectroscopic studies for high - precision radial velocities to measure the stellar wobble and hence the masses of the smaller transiting bodies presents a considerable challenge for present - generation instruments . the wide - angle ground - based exoplanet transit surveys , in contrast to kepler , survey brighter stars typically within 100  pc . for these relatively nearby stars , follow - up observations are considerably easier .    the alsubai project @xcite has initiated a wide - field transit search programme deploying initially a 5-camera ccd imaging system designed to go deeper than most current wide - angle survey systems such as superwasp , hatnet , tres and xopmcc / xo/ ] .",

    "combining alsubai and superwasp data should increase the exoplanet discovery rate by enabling multiple transits of candidate systems to be obtained more quickly .",
    "the alsubai camera s higher angular resolution and larger aperture should also extend the search for transiting planets to fainter stars with smaller radii , and hence to the discovery of smaller transiting planets .",
