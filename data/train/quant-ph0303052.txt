    "<S> we prove that in the bb84 quantum cryptography protocol alice and bob do not need to make random bases - choice for each qubit : they can keep the same bases for entire blocks of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> it suffices that the raw key consists of many such qubit - blocks . the practical advantage of reducing the need for random number is emphasized .    </S>",
    "<S> the security of quantum cryptography @xcite is based on two main ingredients . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is well known : the celebrated _ no cloning theorem _ @xcite , or - equivalently - heisenberg uncertainty relations@xcite , or _ </S>",
    "<S> entanglement - without - signaling _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second ingredient is also an absolute necessity , although often only mentioned implicitly : truly random choices on both sides . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , quantum cryptography should use quantum randomness , i.e. the only physical source of true randomness . </S>",
    "<S> but , in practice this is a severe constrain , because a complete protocol requires a huge amount of random numbers , from alice s state choices to bob s basis choices and for the random choices and random permutations needed for error correction and privacy amplification .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the rush for quantum random numbers can be reduced during the quantum communication phase of the protocol without impairing on the security against individual attacks . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is the following : alice and bob use the same basis for large blocks of qubits ( hence , here individual attacks refers to attacks block - by - block ) . during sifting , </S>",
    "<S> if they happen to have chosen different bases , the entire block is disregarded . for each block alice and </S>",
    "<S> bob make new and independent random choices of bases . in the limit of large blocks </S>",
    "<S> , this reduces the rate at which random bits are needed by about one half @xcite . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> , one may think that this makes eve s life easier : she knows that all the qubits within a block are coded in the same basis . </S>",
    "<S> but we shall see that this is not the case : eve s optimal attack provides her with no more shannon information , for a given error rate qber , than in the usual case where alice and bob make random base - choices for each qubit . consequently , provided the raw key consists of ( infinitely ) many blocks of qubits , the csiszr , and j. krner theorem @xcite applies : if the mutual information alice - bob is larger than either the mutual informations eve - alice or eve - bob , then alice and bob can distil a secret key . </S>",
    "<S> in practice the mentioned many blocks should be processed together for error correction and privacy amplification ; hence the block size should not be too large , if not error correction and privacy amplification consumes too much time .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof that eve can not take advantage of the fact that all qubits within a block are coded in the same basis ( unknown to eve ) follows an argument given by xiang - bin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it runs by contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> assume that , for a given qber , eve can extract an averaged information per qubit of a block of length @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> then , eve can extract at least as much information attacking each qubit one by one . </S>",
    "<S> for this she prepares @xmath1 pairs of qubits in the singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> she keeps one qubit per singlet and uses the others to simulate a @xmath2 qubit block , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> once alice and bob announced the basis used for this block , i.e. after sifting , eve measures the kept qubits in the announced basis , thus preparing effectively all the @xmath2 qubits of the simulated block in the same basis , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . hence </S>",
    "<S> , she can extract information per qubit from the simulated block , including information on the qubit sent by alice .    </S>",
    "<S> this rather simple argument is of great practical value , assuming that the result also holds against coherent attacks ( i.e. attacks on the qubits of all blocks ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in realistic implementations @xcite alice sends out several millions of qubits per second , and the trend is clearly towards even higher rates . </S>",
    "<S> this implies megabits of quantum random numbers , a difficult though not impossible task . </S>",
    "<S> reducing this factor by quasi one half , without reducing the security , is clearly advantageous . for example , in the plug-&-play configuration we do already send blocks of qubits from alice to bob , in order to circumvent rayleigh backscattering @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the result presented in this note softens the random number generation bottleneck . </S>"
