    "the high energy behavior of strong interaction in the regge limit has been being studied since more than forty years , at the beginning in the so called s - matrix theory approach and subsequently using field theory models for the object describing the leading behavior of the cross section , the pomeron .",
    "after quantum chromodynamics has been found to describe perturbatively many aspects of strong interactions , the regge limit of this theory has been investigated leading to the so called bfkl physics  @xcite and in general small @xmath1 physics , mainly analyzed in deep inelastic scattering experiments , as the one at hera .    theoretically in small @xmath1 qcd",
    "one can observe the emerging of an effective theory , which in its more simple form can be seen as an interacting theory ( due to the appearance of a triple pomeron vertex  @xcite ) of non local pomerons in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "such field theory models , even if oversymplified , are too complicated to be analyzed analytically .",
    "what have been proposed in the past as even simpler toy models to be analyzed and improve the understanding were models in 0 + 1 dimensions , a kind of quantum mechanics of pomerons , and a local 2 + 1 dimensional theory .",
    "they were introduced before the qcd analysis  @xcite , but nevertheless are characterized by some common features implied by it .",
    "the former was analyzed many years ago and reconsidered recently  @xcite from different points of view .",
    "the latter was also studied many years ago but most of the questions remained open .",
    "we report here some results of a recent work  @xcite devoted to formulate a novel perturbative approach useful to analyze this @xmath0 qft model .",
    "it is well known that a partial effective description of a system can be associated to a non hermitian hamiltonian which is characterized by a non unitary evolution .",
    "nevertheless several attempts to analyzed such systems and to try even to formulate some consistent non hermitian quantum mechanics has been done .",
    "the first interesting result was found by bender @xcite who noted that there exist non hermitian hamiltonians having a real spectrum bounded from below .",
    "this was shown to be possible if also specific boundary conditions for the wave functions of the associated sturm - liouville differential problem were properly defined .",
    "the main point at the base of these properties is that such hamiltonians can be formally obtained by a similarity transformation acting on well defined hermitian ones  @xcite .",
    "note that the same considerations formally apply to systems with a finite ( qm ) or infinite ( qft )  @xcite degrees of freedom .",
    "a special class of hamiltonians having these property was found to have an unbroken @xmath2 symmetry , so that the hamiltonian @xmath3 and the operator @xmath2 have common eigenstates . in such a case",
    "it is possible to define a special scalar product , leading to a norm conserved in time , as follows @xmath4^t(x ) g(x)$ ] , @xmath5 denoting the transpose operation .",
    "such @xmath2-norm is not positive and there exist an operator @xmath6 , commuting with both @xmath3 and @xmath2 , which select the two possible signs . by constructing the operator @xmath6 , which depends on the hamiltonian @xmath3 itself , it is therefore possible to construct another scalar product @xmath7^t(x ) g(x)$ ] and",
    "define an hilbert space with a positive norm conserved in time .",
    "the observables are defined to satisfy @xmath8 , which reduces to the hermiticity condition for the usual case @xmath9 in conventional qm .    in our case the local effective theory for interacting pomerons ( @xmath2 symmetric and with an hamiltonian with real eigenvalues ) is associated to the evolution in rapidity and the scalar product is the conventional one with the norm of pomeron states , which interact by the triple pomeron vertex , not conserved in rapidity .",
    "nevertheless the operators introduced above are very useful to develope a perturbative analysis .",
    "indeed let us consider a system with the hamiltonian h = h_0+h_i , where @xmath10 ( the free part ) is hermitian and @xmath11 ( the interaction part ) is anti - hermitian .",
    "we define the parity operator to transform @xmath3 into @xmath12 so that @xmath13=0 $ ] , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "one has to look for the operator @xmath6 such that = [ c , pt]=0 .",
    "[ chpt ] it is convenient to assume the general form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an hermitian operator , that together with the previous commutation relations imply 2 e^q h_i=[e^q , h ] . [ eqq ] moreover one obtains easily the relation @xmath18 , which also implies h = e^-q/2 he^q/2=e^q/2 h^e^-q/2=h^. [ defh ] therefore we have found an hermitian hamiltonian @xmath19 which is similar to @xmath3 by means of the similarity transformation induced by the operator @xmath20 .",
    "this general relations can be studied perturbatively for a small coupling @xmath21 .",
    "we start by looking for a perturbative expansion of @xmath22 by solving eq .",
    "( [ eqq ] ) which gives : [ h_0,q_1]=-2h_i ,  = -[condq ] and so on . from these relations",
    "one obtains , as we shall see , an explicit form for the @xmath23 .",
    "once @xmath17 is known as a power series in @xmath21 , the hamiltonian @xmath19 can also be found in the same form : @xmath24 with the first terms given by h^(0)=h_0 , h^(2)=[h_i , q_1 ] , h^(4)=[h_i , q_3]+ .",
    "let us start by defining the lrft as a theory of two fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 depending on rapidity @xmath27 and transverse coordinates @xmath1 with a lagrangian density = ( _ y--_x^2)+i(x)(x ) , where @xmath28 is the intercept minus unity and @xmath29 is the slope of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "note that if @xmath28 the corresponding functional integral is divergent and the only way to define the theory beyond the set of perturbative feynman diagram is the analytic continuation from @xmath30 when the theory is well defined .",
    "such a continuation is automatic in the the hamiltonian approach , where a quasi - schroedinger equation for the wave function @xmath31 is defined : = -h(y ) , h = h_0+h_i with the free part given by h_0=d^2x ( -(x)(x)+(x)(x ) ) and the interaction part by h_i = id^2x ( x)(x ) .",
    "standard commutation relations are valid between @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34=\\delta^2(x - x')$ ] . the scattering amplitude with the target ( initial ) state @xmath35 at rapidity @xmath36 and the projectile ( final ) state @xmath37 at rapidity @xmath38 is defined as ia_fi(y_2-y_1)=_f(y_2)|e^-h(y_2-y_1)|_i(y_1 ) .",
    "[ ampl ] one can demonstrate that the perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath21 of this expression reproduces the standard reggeon diagrams of the lrft and also that ( [ ampl ] ) satisfies the requirement of symmetry between the target and projectile ( see  @xcite ) parity transformation @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 so that @xmath42 , while @xmath43 is the complex conjugation , so that @xmath44=0 $ ] .",
    "any state can be written as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a real function and @xmath47 so that @xmath48 .",
    "we shall look for a perturbatively constructed similarity transformation , as illustrated in the previous section , in order to write any transition amplitude as ia_fi(y_2-y_1)=e^q/2_f(y_2)|e^-h(y_2-y_1)|e^-q/2_i(y_1 ) .",
    "in particular the simplest object one can imagine is the full pomeron green function at rapidity @xmath27 and momentum @xmath49 will be given as as ^2(k - k)g(y , k)=<0|(k)e^q/2e^-yhe^-q/2(k)|0>. on restricting to the first non trivial order in perturbation theory one is looking for q_1=-2d^2x_1d^2x_2d^2x_3 ( f_1(x_1,x_2,x_3)_1_2_3 - h.c . ) , and obtains for the fourier transform of @xmath50 : _ 1(k_1,k_2,k_3)=. [ f1 ] the corresponding correction of order @xmath51 to the hamiltonian @xmath19 similar to @xmath3 is given by h^(2)=[h_i , q_1]=h^(2)_single+h^(2)_pair+h^(2)_nc .",
    "[ h2 ]    the first contribution is a correction to the single pomeron propagation .",
    "h^(2)_single = d^2k(k)(k)^(2)(k ) , ^(2)(k)=- .",
    "this term gives a correction to the pomeron energy @xmath52 .",
    "a renormalization is needed and choosing the condition @xmath53 one finds @xmath54 which leads to the renormalization of the pomeron slope _ren=-^2 .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) @xmath57 has a complicated structure associated to the interaction of two pomerons h^(2)_pair = d^2k_1d^2k_2d^2q_1d^2q_2 ^ 2(q_1+q_2-k_1-k_2 ) v^(2)(q_1,q_2|k_1,k_2)(q_1)(q_2)(k_1)(k_2 ) , with an interaction potential @xmath58 being non local and with some degenerate terms depending only on the incoming or outgoing momenta .",
    "in such a case one may be interested in studying the scattering states , not changing the spectrum , and in the presence of bound states which instead could deeply affect the spectrum .",
    "let us note that due to the fact that to order @xmath51 in the spectrum of @xmath19 there are no transition in the number of pomeron states , one can really solve the problem with quantum mechanical techniques . in the analysis of the two pomeron potential we have considered for simplicity the forward direction @xmath59 so that @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the schrdinger equation to be solved reads in momentum space reads ( ( q)-e)(q)=-d^2kv(q|k)(k ) .",
    "[ eq1 ] omitting the technical details derived in * ? ? ?",
    "* , we simply present here our findings . solving the associated lippman - schwinger equation for the scattering matrix one obtains to order @xmath51 , after performing a regularization to handle divergent quantities , t(q|l)=v_1(q|l)-_2(q)- , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this also gives the solution of the scattering states @xmath66 .    in order to investigate the existence of bound states of energy @xmath67 we consider the associated equation t_e(q)=d^2k , _",
    "e(q)=. [ eq4 ] the condition of the existence of bound states can be reduced to the existence of the solution of a secular equation of a finite algebraic problem . in a perturbative sense ,",
    "i.e. for small values of @xmath21 one can show that there are no solutions .",
    "they may appear at larger values of @xmath21 , a case for which which nevertheless some higher order terms in the perturbative expansion may be also important .",
    "we stress that the results obtained are valid for an evolution along rapidity intervals @xmath68 .",
