    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are observed in various bands from radio to gamma - ray .",
    "x - ray observations provide the evidence that electrons are accelerated to highly relativistic energies in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is believed that ions are also accelerated to the `` knee '' ( @xmath2 ev ) of the galactic cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum providing most of the galactic crs .",
    "the most popular acceleration mechanism is diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite . to make the galactic crs , on average",
    "a few tens of percent of the explosion energy of a supernova has to be converted to the cr energy so that accelerated crs change the shock structure to make the precursor in the upstream @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of neutral particles has been identified in many young snrs from the detection of h@xmath0 emissions .",
    "a recent review of h@xmath0 emission from snrs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the neutral fraction of the interstellar matter around snrs is often found to be order of unity . for example , @xcite have shown that the neutral fraction is about 0.8 and 0.1 in tycho and sn1006 environments , respectively .",
    "since snr shocks are collisionless , neutral particles can penetrate the shock front freely without deceleration . as a result , a significant relative velocity exists between the plasma and neutral particles in the shock downstream region when the shock is unmodified by accelerated crs . through the charge exchange process in the downstream region",
    ", hot protons are converted to hot neutral hydrogens which emit broad h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "conversely , the cold neutrals are converted to cold protons which are not equilibrated with the downstream thermal protons due to the coulomb collision because the relaxation time scale @xmath3 @xmath4 is much larger than the age of young snr ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the proton number density and the relative velocity between the cold protons and the thermal protons , respectively . @xcite",
    "have shown that the charge - exchanged ions amplify the magnetic field and change the shock structure in the downstream .    in this letter , we propose that charge - exchanged ions are also important in the precursor of the shock modified by the cr because the relative velocity between hydrogens and protons exists in the precursor .",
    "although the neutral hydrogen damps the plasma wave indispensable for dsa in the upstream region , the wave amplitude is still kept to be strong enough through the excitation by crs near the shock front @xcite .",
    "hence , crs can be accelerated in the partially ionized gas @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite have observed h@xmath0 from the precursor in the snr tycho .",
    "the charge - exchanged ions excite plasma waves @xcite and are scattered by the waves @xcite . as the result , the plasma waves amplify the upstream magnetic field and the charge - exchanged ions become isotropic pickup ions . to estimate the efficiency of the charge exchange in the precursor , we compare the precursor length @xmath8 with the mean free path of the charge exchange @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cross section of charge exchange which is almost constant @xmath11 for @xmath12 and a steeply decreasing function of @xmath7 for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we here estimate the precursor length as the diffusion length of crs @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cr momentum , the diffusion coefficient of cr and the shock velocity , respectively . assuming the bohm diffusion for crs @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ", we obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "thus , we expect that more than a few percent of hydrogens are converted to the pickup ions in the precursor . because on average @xmath22 fraction of the upstream protons are needed to be injected into dsa to supply the galactic crs @xcite , the pickup ions are clearly important for the injection into crs and for the modification of the shock structure .",
    "we first provide a simple model of the modified shock structure ( section 2 ) .",
    "we then solve the distribution function of the pickup ions ( section 3 ) and discuss impacts on the jump condition of subshock ( section 4 ) and the particle acceleration ( section 5 ) .",
    "to calculate the distribution of pickup ions , we need to know the relative velocity between protons and hydrogens in the precursor . in this section",
    ", we make a simplified model of the precursor structure of modified shock .",
    "we assume that the pickup ions do not change the precursor structure , that is , the number of pickup ions is smaller than that of thermal protons .",
    "the shock structure modified by the cr pressure has been calculated by various methods @xcite . in order to retain an essential feature of the structure of modified shocks , we determine the approximate structure of the precursor .",
    "mass and momentum conservation laws at the shock rest frame are @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the plasma density , flow velocity , the plasma pressure and the cr pressure , respectively . here , subscript @xmath28 means quantities far upstream and no subscript means those in the precursor , and @xmath29 is the coordinate of the direction along the shock normal ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the position of the subshock and far upstream , respectively . ) . neglecting the gas pressure , the velocity in the precursor is @xmath32 where @xmath27 is given as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distribution function of cr , and we assume that the pressure of non - relativistic cr is negligible . to make the expression simple ,",
    "we use @xmath34 as the approximate solution of test particle dsa @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the heaviside step function . from equations  ( [ eq : u ] ) , ( [ eq : pcr ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) , we obtain the velocity structure of the plasma in the precursor @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the maximum lorentz factor of crs . we presume that @xmath41 is order of @xmath42 to be consistent with the general scheme of cr modified shock and the galactic cr production .",
    "therefore , the velocity deceleration in the precursor region is around @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the precursor scale @xmath8 is @xmath45 and for @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the distribution function of the pickup ions at the subshock , @xmath48 .",
    "charge - exchanged ions excite plasma waves and make a bispherical distribution by the pitch angle scattering with the excited waves . here , we approximate the bispherical distribution as an isotropic distribution at plasma rest frame since the alfvn mach number ( @xmath49 ) of snr shocks is high .    from equation ( [ eq : efficiency ] ) ,",
    "@xmath8 is usually smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "then , pickup ions are produced in the whole precursor region and the flow velocity of hydrogens is @xmath17 in the precursor .",
    "hence , the relative flow velocity between the hydrogens and protons @xmath51 is @xmath52 we here assume that the thermal velocity of protons and hydrogens is smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "the validity of this assumption is discussed later .",
    "the transit time of pickup ions over the precursor region is @xmath53 which is less than @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 from equation ( [ eq : pp ] ) , the equilibration time of the coulomb collision in the precursor is @xmath56 the recombination time @xmath57 is @xmath58 where we use the electron temperature @xmath59 because the electron thermal velocity is comparable to or larger than @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath57 are much larger than the transit time , so that we neglect the collision and the recombination processes .",
    "moreover , we neglect the charge exchange process between pickup ions and hydrogens because of @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we consider only the charge exchange process between hydrogens and thermal protons .",
    "then , the steady - state boltzmann equation for pickup ions in the shock rest frame is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the velocity of pickup ions at plasma rest frame and @xmath63 is the hydrogen number density .",
    "the solution is @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the proton number density far upstream",
    ". then the distribution function of the pickup ions at the shock front is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the distribution functions of the pickup ions ionized in the @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , and they are @xmath72 @xmath73 where we approximate @xmath63 as a constant . for @xmath74 , @xmath68",
    "is approximately expressed by @xmath75",
    "in this section we discuss the jump condition of the subshock in the presence of pickup ions . as is well known for the termination shock of the solar wind ( @xmath76 ) , large number of pickup ions change the jump condition of shocks @xcite .",
    "the high pressure of pickup ions makes the mach number and the compression ratio small .",
    "in addition , there is no guarantee that the behavior of the pickup ions in the shock is the same as that of gas with adiabatic index @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the peculiar behavior ( adiabatic index @xmath78 ) of pickup ions may allow the possibility that the total compression ratio can be smaller than 4 and the spectrum of cr can be softer than predicted by the test particle dsa , even if the shock is modified by the crs .",
    "the pressure of pickup ions at the subshock front is @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are partial pressures due to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . approximating the third term of equation ( [ eq : sf1 ] ) @xmath82 by @xmath83",
    ", we obtain @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the density of hydrogens . from equations ( [ eq : f2 ] ) and ( [ eq : pip ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 if the modification of the shock is not strong enough ( @xmath87 ) , the pressure of pickup ions is negligible ( @xmath88 ) , so that the effect of pickup ions on the precursor structure is negligible and our treatment in section [ sec:2 ] is valid . if @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and if most hydrogens become the pickup ions in the precursor , from equation ( [ eq : p1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2 ] ) , the pressure of pickup ions account for about a few tens of percent of the ram pressure at the subshock , that is , the mach number at subshock is almost @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the compression ratio at the subshock is almost @xmath92 , so that the total compression ratio can be smaller than 4 .",
    "although our treatment in section [ sec:2 ] is not valid in this case , we qualitatively can expect the reduction of subshock compression and the strong magnetic field amplification .    to calculate the jump condition of the subshock rigorously , we have to study the behavior of the pickup ions when they pass over the subshock @xcite .",
    "although it should be investigated by particle in cell simulations , possible effects are mentioned in the next section .",
    "as already discussed , the total compression ratio may become smaller than 4 .",
    "therefore , even when the snr is young , that is , the mach number of the shock is large , the spectral index of crs may be softer than 2 .    at present , the injection process for cr accelerations at shocks is still an open problem .",
    "it is regarded that some particles above the threshold velocity are injected into the acceleration process . as discussed above ,",
    "the heating of plasma at the subshock is weak when the pickup ions drain a large fraction of the shock kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the pickup ions have the velocity much larger than that of thermal plasma and are important for the injection into crs .",
    "this is a similar process to the solar wind termination shock where the pickup ions have been considered as the origin of the anomalous cr .",
    "the behavior of the pickup ions at the subshock of snr has rarely been investigated . while the adiabatic acceleration is an important process , in this letter",
    ", we discuss the multiply reflected ion acceleration @xcite as another possible process .",
    "when the shock is the collisionless quasi - perpendicular shock , there is an electrostatic potential to reflect some upstream thermal ions @xcite .",
    "the reflected thermal ions can penetrate the shock front after the reflection .",
    "@xcite estimated the amplitude of the electrostatic potential in the steady - state framework . however , for the high @xmath49 shock , the shock is not stationary @xcite and the amplitude of time - averaged electrostatic potential is estimated by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is an order of unity parameter @xcite . in the rest frame of the precursor plasma , particles satisfying @xmath95 are reflected by the electrostatic potential , where @xmath96 is the velocity of the shock normal direction and @xmath97 .",
    "there are many pickup ions satisfying the reflection condition compared with thermal ions , and the pickup ions can be reflected by the electrostatic potential many times .",
    "the reflected ions drift to the direction of the motional electric field @xmath98 . as a result ,",
    "the reflected ions are accelerated .",
    "this acceleration mechanism is so - called shock surfing acceleration @xcite .",
    "the number of the pickup ions reflected by the potential @xmath99 is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is defined by @xmath102 , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 . since the total number density of the pickup ions @xmath105 , from equations ( [ eq : f2 ] ) , ( [ eq : sf1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : ref ] ) , the reflection coefficient of the pickup ions @xmath106 are @xmath107 figure  [ fig1 ] shows the reflection coefficients where the red , green and blue lines show @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , the solid , dashed and dotted lines show @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively",
    ". there exists the critical @xmath41 at which the reflection coefficient becomes 0 . from the condition",
    "@xmath114 , this critical @xmath115 is @xmath116 when @xmath117 , there are reflected pickup ions , so that it is possible that the multiply reflected ion acceleration occurs . when the shock normal component of the lorentz force becomes larger than the electric force of the electrostatic potential , the particle escapes to the downstream .",
    "so that the maximum velocity of accelerated particles is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the thickness of the electrostatic potential and @xmath120 is the magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal direction .",
    "the observation of the termination shock of the solar wind shows @xmath121 @xcite . from equation  ( [ eq : vmax ] ) , the maximum velocity is @xmath122 therefore , the multiply reflected ion acceleration at snr shocks can make relativistic crs and is important for the injection mechanism .",
    "this acceleration makes a harder spectrum than that of dsa @xcite , so that this may explain that the observed @xmath123-ray spectrum from w51c is harder than expected for dsa @xcite .",
    "however , since the high @xmath49 ( @xmath124 ) collisionless shocks are not well understood , i.e. , the shock structure may be different from the solar wind termination shock , it should be investigated whether the multiply reflected ion acceleration really occurs or not at snr shocks .",
    "we discuss some important processes neglected in the above investigations .",
    "if considerable hydrogens are converted to the pickup ions as discussed in section  [ sec:3 ] , they may change the structure of the precursor because of their large momentum flux .",
    "this issue will be addressed in future work .    in section  [ sec:3 ] , we neglected any processes other than the charge exchange .",
    "if the upstream plasma is strongly heated by unstable waves in the precursor @xcite , that is , if the temperature becomes @xmath125 , neutral hydrogens are ionized by the electron scattering and the ionized particles can not be distinguished from thermal ions because thermal ions have the velocity comparable to that of the pickup ions .",
    "@xcite showed that the collisional ionization occurs in the upstream of snr .    in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we considered only the case @xmath126 .",
    "if the magnetic field is not so strong and @xmath44 , the precursor scale is the diffusion length of the maximum energy cr and @xmath127 ( see equation ( [ eq : efficiency ] ) and ( [ eq : ux ] ) ) . for @xmath127 ,",
    "the multiple charge exchange is important @xcite . to take account of it and collisional ionization",
    ", we must fully take into account the velocity dependence of the various atomic cross sections .",
    "we will make full calculation in future work to investigate these issues .",
    "@xcite predicted that the pickup ions introduce a non - gaussian broad h@xmath0 line from downstream region .",
    "we also predict it from upstream region .",
    "so far , in calculations of h@xmath0 from snr , one has treated the pickup ions and thermal plasma as one fluid , and assumed that the pickup ions do not affect the plasma flow .",
    "as mentioned previously , the pickup ions should be treated as a separate component .",
    "in this letter , we have investigated the effects of neutral particles on the shock modified by the cr at snrs .",
    "more than a few percent of hydrogens are converted to pickup ions by the charge exchange in the precursor . in section  [ sec:3 ] , assuming that the pickup ions become isotropic in the rest frame of the precursor plasma , we calculated the expected distribution of pickup ions at the precursor .",
    "the pickup ions amplify the magnetic field and heat the upstream plasma . moreover , the pickup ions have a large pressure in the precursor and change the jump condition of the subshock when the upstream plasma is strongly pushed by the cr pressure ( @xmath128 ) . in addition , because of the large velocity of the pickup ions , they are preferentially accelerated by dsa .",
    "if the shock is the quasi - perpendicular shock and if the multiply reflected ion acceleration occurs , it is possible to make harder spectrum of cr than predicted by the test particle dsa below gev .",
    "hence , the pickup ions are important for the injection into cr .",
