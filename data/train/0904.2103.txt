    "the reaction    @xmath108    occurs at a rate @xmath109 = 1.7@xmath110 s@xmath100 with only 1/3 of those being m1 transitions . in order to obtain the axion flux expected from this nuclear reaction we must evaluate the axion - photon branching ratio  ( [ brratio ] ) using the correct values of parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which is made difficult by the fact that ( [ fusion ] ) is a 3-body nuclear decay",
    "however , as pointed out by  @xcite , ( [ fusion ] ) is predominantly isovector , implying that @xmath111 is very small and can be neglected . under this assumption ,",
    "equation  ( [ brratio ] ) becomes  @xcite    @xmath112    using @xmath58=0 , @xmath113  mev , and @xmath114 we have    @xmath115    combining equation  ( [ brratio3 ] ) and the rate of proton - deuteron fusion reactions characterized as the m1 nuclear transition , we obtain the total flux of 5.5  mev solar axions @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the earth to sun distance .    using the data obtained from the 6 month run in 2004",
    ", we can thus evaluate the sensitivity of the cast @xmath2-ray calorimeter to these axion signals .",
    "the cern axion solar telescope ( cast ) utilizes a helioscope design which exploits the increased axion - to - photon conversion probability for increased magnetic field strength and length as given by equation  ( [ convprob ] ) .",
    "the refurbished lhc dipole prototype magnet  @xcite produces a nominal magnetic field of @xmath118 t over a length of @xmath119 m in each of the dipole s two 14.5 @xmath120 area magnet bores .",
    "the full system is mounted on a rotating platform with a vertical range of @xmath121 and an azimuthal range of @xmath122 .",
    "this range of motion allows for 1.5 hours of solar alignment during both sunrise and sunset year - round .",
    "the tracking system monitors the alignment of the magnet with the sun , resulting in a pointing accuracy better than 0.01@xmath123 .",
    "all remaining time is devoted to background measurements for the low - background x - ray detectors which are installed on both ends of the magnet . until 2007 , a conventional time projection chamber ( tpc ) covered both magnet bores at one end to detect photons originating from axions during the tracking of the sun at sunset .",
    "it was then replaced by two micromegas detectors , each attached to one bore . on the other side of the magnet",
    ", there is another micromegas detector covering one bore , and an x - ray mirror telescope with a pn - ccd chip as the focal plane detector at the other bore , both intended to detect photons produced from axions during the sunrise solar tracking .",
    "more details about the cast experiment and detectors can be found in  @xcite .    to cover a wide range of potential axion masses ,",
    "the operation of the cast experiment is divided into two phases . during the phase",
    "i ( 20032004 )  @xcite the experiment operated with vacuum inside the magnet bores and the sensitivity was essentially limited to @xmath124 ev due to the coherence condition . in the second phase ( so - called phase ii ) which started in 2005",
    ", the magnet bores are filled with a buffer gas in order to extend the sensitivity to higher axion masses . in the first part of this phase ( 20052006 )",
    "@xmath125he was used as a buffer gas . by increasing the gas pressure in appropriate steps , axion masses up to @xmath150.4 ev",
    "were scanned and the results of these measurements supersede all previous experimental limits on the axion - photon coupling constant in this mass range  @xcite . to explore axion masses above 0.4ev",
    ", @xmath126he has to be used because it has a higher vapor pressure than @xmath125he .",
    "this allows for a further increase in gas pressure in the magnet bores to reach axion masses up to about 1 ev in the ongoing second part of phase ii that started in 2007 and is planned to finish by the end of 2010 .",
    "axions emitted in a particular nuclear decay channel will be essentially mono - energetic compared to the primakoff spectrum expected from plasma processes .",
    "however , several candidate processes exist and so the corresponding mono - energetic axion lines are expected to be in the range from tens of kev to many  mev .",
    "the expected axion signal from any single channel is thus a collimated beam of similarly mono - energetic @xmath2-rays ( a `` peak '' ) from the magnet bore during periods of solar alignment .",
    "the calorimeter consists of a cadmium tungstate scintillating crystal ( cdwo@xmath127 or cwo ) , which is also the type used in neutrinoless double - beta decay searches  @xcite .",
    "cwo offers good stopping power for @xmath2-ray photons , very low internal radioactivity , good energy resolution and excellent pulse shape discrimination characteristics ( see section  [ cuts ] ) .",
    "the crystal is optically coupled to a light guide and photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) which is placed inside a lead - shielded cylindrical brass tube . this `` tunnel '' design maximizes signal acceptance and background rejection while respecting the space and weight limitations on the cast detector platform ( see figure  [ schematiccalo](b ) )",
    ". these constraints also limit the allowed thickness ( 2.5 cm ) of ancient and common lead shielding , which results in an elevated environmental background component compared to that achievable with fewer constraints . an active scintillating plastic muon veto , environmental radon purging with constant n@xmath128 flow , a borated thermal neutron absorber , and a low - background pmt complement the minimalist passive shielding design .",
    "the large dynamic range and high stopping power for photons are necessary to achieve a good efficiency at high energies for a generic search .",
    "detector components , shielding materials , and data processing were all designed in order to reduce the environmental backgrounds .",
    "pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) further reduces noise and events due to internal radioactive contaminations in the crystal .",
    "finally , an led pulser provides livetime monitoring .",
    "these square pulses are recorded and subsequently removed prior to analysis .",
    "although similar searches have been conducted in beam dump experiments  @xcite , accelerators and terrestrial nuclear processes  @xcite , cast is the first high - energy - axion search using a helioscope .",
    "the order of magnitude increase in axion - to - photon conversion probability over previous helioscope searches and the increases intensity of axion emission from the sun as compared to accelerator searches makes the cast calorimeter a very sensitive probe of low - mass pseudoscalars .",
    "because axions serve as merely one example of such particles , a high - energy search should not be limited to only axions but should consider anomalous excess during solar tracking events generally  @xcite .    the data and results presented in this paper were obtained from cast phase i.      following a method similar to  @xcite , we have developed and applied a pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) algorithm which exploits the distinct pulse shape characteristics of the cwo crystal in response to incident particle type .",
    "this algorithm relies on the difference in response for nuclear recoils and minimum ionizing particles due to the different mechanisms of scintillation for these two types of excitations .",
    "the long @xmath1520@xmath129s decay of cwo results from the presence of 2 - 4 separate decay constants  @xcite and enhances these differences and allows for efficient psd .",
    "particle calibrations were performed using alpha s ( @xmath130 s ) , neutrons ( @xmath131 s ) , and photons ( @xmath2 s ) to create a weighting factor using a statistical average over many pulse shapes for each calibration source .",
    "the radioactive sources used for the calibrations represent a spectrum of energies : @xmath132am ( @xmath130 s ) , am / be and @xmath133cf ( @xmath131 s and @xmath2 s ) , and multiple @xmath2 sources ( 0.511 , 0.662 , 0.835 , 1.173 , 1.333 , 1.836 mev ) .",
    "particle `` templates '' are formed with these data and are used to create a spectral weighting factor . the psd algorithm",
    "is then applied to the data to remove backgrounds and noise .",
    "we construct the @xmath2 template with 9322 events using the @xmath134y ( 1.8 mev ) source , the @xmath130 template with 7781 events from the @xmath132am source , and the @xmath131 template with 450 events from the am / be source , each of which are shown in figure  [ fig : psdandpid ] . due to @xmath2 contamination from the am / be source , several tests were performed in order to ensure a high purity of true nuclear recoil events .",
    "layers of polyethylene shielding were added in steps to successively reduce the presence of neutron interactions in the crystal and isolate the @xmath2 events in the sample . the pulse shape identification ( pid ) spectrum ( shown in figure  [ fig : alphagammapid ] for @xmath130 and @xmath2 calibrations and described in more detail below ) was then remeasured in order to identify the region populated by the neutron recoils .",
    "events were selected in this range for the measured neutron template .",
    "it is important to note here that these templates are obtained from raw data without signal filtering or artificial pulse shaping and represent the cwo response to mechanisms of energy deposited .",
    "the spectral weighting factor is determined using the particle templates described above and is defined as @xmath135 here , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the pulse amplitudes as a function of time ( @xmath138 ) for the @xmath130 and @xmath2 templates , respectively . in order to select events based on pid for the @xmath131 template",
    ", the pid distribution is first calculated using the weighting factor with the @xmath130 particle template as defined in equation  [ eq : weightingfactor ] . once the @xmath131 template is formed using the selected events , @xmath136 may be replaced with @xmath139 .",
    "we refer to the factor in ( [ eq : weightingfactor ] ) as a `` spectral '' weighting factor because it consists of a spectral shape which is to be convoluted with the entire waveform of each event during analysis .",
    "the full pid algorithm can be written as @xmath140f_{{{\\rm } { event}}}(t_k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have converted this spectral shape in time into a single number , the event pid , by taking the sum over the @xmath141 time bins of the event weighted by the weighting factor .",
    "every event is thus assigned a pid value based on this algorithm . to determine the optimum time window ( @xmath141 ) over which to integrate the pulse for @xmath130 and @xmath2 discrimination , we used the quantity @xmath142 which measures the peak separation of the pid distributions , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the rms of the pid distributions measured during calibration .",
    "this quantity is then maximized for the pid distributions to obtain an optimum time window over which to integrate the pulse of @xmath145s , where @xmath146 is the rising edge of the cwo pulse .",
    "this window can be understood qualitatively given the calibration pulse templates in figure  [ fig : templates ] which converge at approximately 10 @xmath129s .    by using both the above described particle ( @xmath130 and @xmath2 ) calibrations , event selection criteria",
    "were determined prior to the analysis of the signal data samples and remain consistent throughout the analysis .",
    "these criteria are first set using @xmath2 calibration data to maintain a calibration signal acceptance of greater than 99.7% , while rejecting electronic noise and square pulses from the livetime pulser .",
    "this yields a background @xmath130 rejection of @xmath1550% , determined directly from the calibration data ( figure  [ fig : alphagammapid ] ) . due to the difficulties in obtaining the optimal algorithm for neutron rejection and the iterative procedure used for extracting the neutron pulse shape template ,",
    "the neutron rejection capability has not been fully quantified for this analysis .",
    "the exact fraction of neutron recoils rejected would be exactly characterized with the help of a pure , mono - energetic neutron emitter which was not available at the time of the calorimeter commissioning and operation .",
    "both background and tracking events are considered for analysis using the same data quality criteria , while solar tracking events have the further requirement that the magnet be sufficiently aligned with the solar core .",
    "corrections are then applied for a small background energy spectrum dependence on the pointing position of the cast magnet , which is due to differences in natural radioactive background throughout the cast experimental hall . by dividing the horizontal - vertical plane traversed by the cast magnet into a set of cells , each of which represents a section of the wall or floor towards which the magnet points at a given time , the position dependence of all detector parameters is directly measured .    in order to ensure the compatibility of the the final tracking and background spectra",
