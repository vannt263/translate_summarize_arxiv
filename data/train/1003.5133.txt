    "the heavy fermion metal ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite is a rare example of a dense kondo system that displays a well defined electron spin resonance ( esr ) signal well below the kondo temperature @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this unexpected observation , discovered for the first time in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , initiated a series of theoretical approaches to understand the origin of the esr line from both an picture of itinerant heavy electrons @xcite and a picture of localized yb@xmath7 spins @xcite .",
    "the latter is supported by the localized character of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite and by the unambiguously local property of the observed esr line , reflecting a large magnetic anisotropy influenced by the crystalline electric field @xcite . besides the relevance of this esr line to study locally the physics of kondo lattices it also provides the possibility to investigate the effect of a large @xmath2-factor anisotropy on the esr intensity - a case which",
    ", although discussed thoroughly in terms of discriminating field - sweep and frequency - sweep esr @xcite , to the best of our knowledge has never been reported for esr probes in metals . both , ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0  and ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibit a highly anisotropic magnetic response , indicating that yb@xmath7 moments are forming an easy plane square lattice within the crystallographic basal plane @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of the anisotropy in the yb - yb interactions has been considered for the resonant susceptibility within a molecular field model , yielding a satisfying description of the observed temperature dependence of the @xmath2-factor @xcite . in this publication ,",
    "we concentrate on a detailed investigation of the esr - intensity of ybir@xmath8si@xmath8 for which , in contrast to ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8 , the resonance is experimentally observable for fields perpendicular to the basal plane .",
    "for our esr measurements we used two in - flux grown single crystals of ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 crystallizing in a body centered tetragonal structure ( i - type ) @xcite .",
    "a huge residual resistivity ratio ( @xmath9 ) of more than 200 indicates a high sample quality and very little crystalline disorder of the ybir@xmath0si@xmath0  sample @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity and the magnetic properties have been thoroughly described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "+ esr detects the absorbed power @xmath10 of a magnetic microwave field @xmath11 as a function of a transverse external static magnetic field @xmath12 . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , a lock - in technique",
    "is used by modulating the static field , which yields the derivative of the resonance signal @xmath13 .",
    "all our esr measurements were performed with a standard bruker spectrometer at x - band frequencies ( @xmath14 ) and using a cylindrical resonator in te@xmath15 mode .",
    "the temperature was varied between @xmath5 using a he - flow cryostat .",
    "+ we used a platelet - like single crystal where the crystallographic @xmath16-axis was perpendicular to the platelet .",
    "the single crystal had a weight of @xmath17 , a surface area of about and a thickness up to .",
    "figure  [ fig0](a ) shows this crystal after cutting a circular disc by spark erosion .",
    "this reduces the mass to @xmath17 for our measurements where we rotated the disc around its symmetry axis and keeping this axis aligned parallel to @xmath11 .",

    "the static magnetic field @xmath21 is always perpendicular to the microwave magnetic field @xmath11.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in figure  [ fig0](b ) we show the three angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 introduced for describing the geometry of our measurement . to map the anisotropy we used on the one hand a goniometer to rotate the crystal by an angle @xmath20 around the direction of the microwave field @xmath11 . on the other hand we manually tilted the basal plane by an angle @xmath19 with respect to @xmath11 and affixed the such oriented ybir@xmath0si@xmath0  crystal in paraffin .",
    "+ for the further discussions we use the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 between the crystallographic fourfold symmetry axis and the direction of the susceptibility component that determines the quantity in question .",

    "the line shape , resonance field and linewidth agree with the previously published spectra parameters @xcite . at @xmath28",

    "the @xmath18 dependence of the esr @xmath2-factor can be nicely fitted with an uniaxial symmetry behavior @xmath35 ( line in inset of figure  [ fig1 ] ) reflecting the tetragonal ybir@xmath0si@xmath0  crystal structure .",
    "as one can see by the solid lines , all spectra nicely agree with a metallic lorentzian , frequently called also dysonian , because of its shape being identical to a conduction spin resonance in the limit of infinite spin diffusion time @xcite . from these fits we determined the esr parameters",
    "linewidth @xmath36 , amplitude @xmath37 and resonance field @xmath38 ( as given by the resonance condition @xmath39 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 , denoting the ratio of dispersion and absorption contributions in the lorentzian shape , was kept constant , @xmath41 , throughout the entire temperature range . a value @xmath42 is expected if the sample size is much larger than the microwave penetration depth . in our case",
    "the penetration depth of ybir@xmath0si@xmath0  at @xmath28 is approximately .",
    "+      the esr - intensity @xmath1 provides a measure for the static resonant susceptibility @xmath43 , which is determined by the @xmath2-value component @xmath44 along the direction of the microwave magnetic field @xmath11 @xcite :    @xmath45    from the recorded esr spectra @xmath1 is determined by integrating the absorption curve in the frequency domain @xcite . the commonly used esr setups record spectra by sweeping the magnetic field and leaving the microwave frequency constant . for this case the typical procedure to determine the intensity is also to integrate the field - sweep absorption curve which then yields a quantity @xmath46 by calculating the area under the curve as @xcite :    @xmath47    however , for the proper relation between @xmath46 and @xmath1 it is necessary to be aware of the correct conversion between the esr spectra integrals in the frequency- and field - domain . for systems with an effective spin @xmath48 @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath2 corresponds to the @xmath2-value component along the static magnetic field @xmath12 that also determines the resonance field via the resonance condition .",
    "hence , especially for systems with large @xmath2-factor variation as a function of e.g. temperature or sample orientation the esr intensity must be evaluated using equation ( [ eq : b ] ) for a field - sweep experiment . for ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 one",
    "observes a very large @xmath2-factor anisotropy ( @xmath50 ) as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , the dependence of the @xmath2-factor anisotropy on the intensity becomes important in an angle dependent experiment .",
    "+     and ( b ) the corresponding @xmath2-factors .",
    "the @xmath51 indices refer to angles as follows : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",

    "note that within the error bars @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath19 ( figure  [ fig3 ] bottom panel ) . for a proper calculation of @xmath3 we took the microwave penetration depth @xmath57 ( @xmath58:electrical conductivity ) into account .",
    "it is worth to note that according to equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) the intensities @xmath59 are nearly equal , following the same temperature dependence and therefore behave as expected from equation ( [ eq:0 ] ) because @xmath11 is parallel to the basal plane in both configurations .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath1 in respect to the angle @xmath19 will be discussed in details in section [ intani ] .",
    "+ the dashed lines in figure  [ fig2](a ) represent curie - weiss laws @xmath60 fitting the data between @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting weiss temperatures are : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , i.e. , within the experimental error of the intensity data one obtains @xmath63 .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that a small difference @xmath64 may be the origin of the weak temperature dependence of @xmath4 below 6k , see figure  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the molecular magnetic field description of the anisotropic yb - yb interaction by huber @xcite provides a link between the @xmath2-factor and the exchange anisotropy which is reflected in @xmath64 : @xmath65 the dashed lines shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) represent fits of the @xmath2-factor temperature dependencies with equations  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) for @xmath5 .",
    "we obtained for the adjustable parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these values reasonably agree with the yb@xmath7 @xmath68-factors calculated for the @xmath69 kramers doublet ground state in the crystal electric field ( cef ) of ybir@xmath0si@xmath0  : @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath4 for @xmath72  k is obviously inconsistent with the low temperature description according equations  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) . instead ,",
    "for instance , excited cef levels may become relevant as observed in the linewidth temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "we first explore the behavior of the esr - intensity at @xmath73 by tilting the basal plane by an angle @xmath19 against @xmath11 ( see figure  [ fig0](b ) ) . at the same time we carefully checked that the @xmath16-axis is always perpendicular to the direction of the static magnetic field @xmath12",
    "( i.e. @xmath74 ) .     by changing",
    "only the angle @xmath19 ( see also figure [ fig0]b ) and keeping @xmath12 always perpendicular to @xmath16-axis ( i.e. @xmath18= ) .",

    "this means that the amplitude of the absorption curve is the only parameter to determine @xmath1 ( @xmath40 was kept constant for fitting the lineshape ) . the main frame of figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath1 with a periodicity of .",
    "according to equation  ( [ eq:0 ] ) the esr - intensity @xmath1 is related to the @xmath2-value component @xmath44 along the microwave magnetic field @xmath11 .",

    "this equation describes the data with a ratio @xmath78 .",
    "however , from the @xmath2-values one would expect for the ratio @xmath79 .",
    "this discrepancy can not be justified by experimental errors and is also found for the system ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8 where the difference is even much larger : @xmath80 as compared to the experimental value of @xmath81 . at this point , we do not have any sound explanation for this discrepancy .    ,",
    "intensity @xmath1 , @xmath2-factor and amplitude @xmath37 by changing only the angle @xmath20 ( see also figure [ fig0]b ) and always keeping the @xmath16-axis perpendicular to @xmath12 and parallel to @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath82 ) .",
    "for this configuration a constant @xmath83 and a constant @xmath84 is expected.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    finally we discuss the behavior of the esr parameters by rotating the ybir@xmath8si@xmath8 crystal around its @xmath16-axis by an angle @xmath20 , leaving the angles @xmath85 constant . for this configuration we used the disc - shaped single crystal shown in figure  [ fig0](a ) where the @xmath16-axis is pointing perpendicular to the disc plane . with this geometry the influence on the microwave field distribution",
    "should be minimized for the @xmath20 rotation .",
    "we expect that the large @xmath2-factor anisotropy should neither be reflected in the resonance field nor in the intensity because the magnetic fields @xmath12 and @xmath11 are always aligned perpendicular to the @xmath16-axis or the crystallographic basal plane , respectively ( compare figure [ fig0](b ) ) . indeed",
    ", as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , both @xmath2-factor ( as determined by the resonance field ) and @xmath1 show only small variations which are consistent with a constant value within experimental accuracy .",
    "however , the -periodicity of the anisotropy of @xmath2-factor , linewidth and the signal amplitude @xmath37 is remarkable and is even exceeding the experimental error in the case of @xmath37 .",
    "this observation should not originate from sample geometry effects which are minimized by using a disc - shaped crystal .",
    "also , we could confirm this anisotropy with a te@xmath86 rectangular resonator that has a different microwave resonant mode .",
    "moreover , it is worth to note that the minima of the linewidth correlate with the @xmath2-factor maxima .",
    "therefore , the anisotropic features point to a sample property although this effect is very weak and was not recognized in previous measurements : the @xmath2-value variation shown in figure  [ fig4 ] is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the usual case of rotation shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    in order to explain the -periodicity of the @xmath2-value",
    "one may assume a fourfold symmetry of a directional distribution of the @xmath16-axes in respect to the rotation axis .",
    "this consideration holds only true if the spread of the @xmath16-axes orientations of our crystal is @xmath87 as estimated from the observed @xmath2-factor variation of @xmath88 .",
    "however , the crystal mosaicity determined by a laue - procedure shows a maximum deviation of @xmath89 from the expected @xmath16-direction .",
    "hence , only a weak intrinsic basal plane anisotropy of the @xmath2-value of ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 should be a plausible explanation of the -@xmath2-periodicity .",
    "it indicates the influence of the off - diagonal crystalline electric field parameters , i.e. @xmath90 and @xmath91 which , for instance , are needed to describe @xmath2-factor anisotropies in cubic crystal symmetry @xcite .",
    "we presented a detailed study of the anisotropy of the esr signal on a ybir@xmath0si@xmath0  crystal at a constant x - band frequency of . as we used a standard field - sweep setup a proper determination of signal intensity @xmath1",
    "is required to take the large @xmath2-factor anisotropy into account .",
    "this leads to a basal plane intensity @xmath92 which is independent from the angle @xmath18 between crystalline c - axis and external magnetic field .",
    "moreover , we found an almost perfect agreement in the temperature dependences of @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath96-factors anisotropies suggests a weak exchange anisotropy which is consistent with the behavior of @xmath3 within a molecular field treatment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we obtained a remarkable result that is not expected for strongly anisotropic @xmath2-factors of the yb@xmath7-esr : a rotation of the basal plane by the angle @xmath19 respective the microwave field direction yields a much smaller change of @xmath1 than expected from the @xmath2-factor anisotropy .",
    "another interesting behavior was found when leaving the crystalline symmetry axis oriented with fixed angles @xmath85 respective to the external field : then the rotation of the crystalline sample still showed a -periodicity in the esr line parameters indicating the influence of the off - diagonal crystalline electric field parameters .",
