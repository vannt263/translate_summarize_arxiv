    "on one hand , the key papers of borho and kraft @xcite describe sheets as disjoint union of so - called _ decomposition classes _ ( also known as _",
    "jordan classes _ ) .",
    "the decomposition classes form a finite partition of @xmath2 , each class being irreducible , locally closed and of constant orbit dimension .",
    "in particular , there is a dense class in each given sheet .",
    "an important notion used in @xcite is the parabolic induction of orbits introduced in @xcite which gives rise to a notion of induction of decomposition classes .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a sheet @xmath11 with dense decomposition class @xmath12 is precisely the union of the decomposition classes induced from @xmath12 .",
    "two consequences of this are the following .",
    "firstly , each sheet contains a unique nilpotent orbit .",
    "secondly , there is a parameterization of sheets coming with induction @xcite .",
    "later , broer developed methods for a deeper study of decomposition classes , their closures , regular closures , quotients and normalizations in @xcite . on the other hand , making use of the previous parameterization , it is shown in @xcite that sheets are parameterized by their slodowy slices .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath13 be a representative of the nilpotent orbit of a sheet @xmath11 of @xmath2 and embed @xmath13 in an @xmath14-triple @xmath15 .",
    "the slodowy slice of @xmath11 ( with respect to @xmath13 ) is @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for the centraliser of @xmath18 in @xmath2 .",
    "katsylo proves that @xmath19 and that a geometric quotient of @xmath11 can be expressed as a finite quotient of @xmath20 . in @xcite ,",
    "i m hof shows that the morphism @xmath21 is smooth .",
    "this relates smoothness of @xmath11 to smoothness of @xmath20 and eventually leads to a proof of smoothness of sheets in classical lie algebras . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only known case of a singular sheet lies in a simple lie algebra of type g@xmath0 @xcite . in this case , the two non - trivial sheets ( _ i.e. _ non - regular and with more than one orbit ) are the two irreducible components of the set of subregular elements .",
    "one of these subregular sheets @xmath22 is smooth while the other @xmath23 is singular .",
    "more precisely , we can see that three analytical germs of @xmath23 intersect in the neighborhood of elements of the subregular nilpotent orbit . in @xcite , an explicit desingularization of @xmath23",
    "is constructed in terms of the well - known projection @xmath24 .",
    "we now look at the symmetric case and sheets of @xmath6 .",
    "most of the ground results the authors are aware of in this setting are gathered in @xcite .",
    "an important feature is that there exists a notion of _ @xmath25-decomposition class _ in @xmath6 and these classes share several good properties with the usual decomposition classes of @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", there is still a unique dense @xmath25-decomposition class in each sheet of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , each sheet of @xmath6 contains at least one nilpotent orbit .",
    "however the uniqueness statement no longer holds in general .",
    "one of the obstacles rising in the study of the sheets of @xmath6 is the lack of a well behaved notion of parabolic induction as one can check in the @xmath26-case .",
    "for instance the induction theory developed in @xcite does not preserve orbit codimension , hence is of little help for our purpose .",
    "the main philosophy of @xcite consists in noting that , at least in the case @xmath27 , the slodowy slices of a sheet @xmath11 of @xmath6 still seem to encode significant geometric information of @xmath11 .",
    "one of the aim of the present work is to justify this assertion in a more systematic manner . for instance",
    ", we show in section [ slosli ] that several properties of sheets , such as dimension , smoothness and orbits involved , are fully reflected in the corresponding slodowy slices .",
    "we state these results for wider classes of subvarieties of @xmath6 in proposition [ propsmooth ] , theorem [ genpart ] and proposition [ deformation1 ] .",
    "then we introduce in section [ sliceind ] the notion of slice induction .",
    "it turns out to be precise enough to rebuilt important parts of the theory resulting from parabolic induction in the lie algebra case .",
    "this includes ( see theorem [ thmind ] and corollary [ corind ] ) :    construction of one parameter deformations of orbits .",
    "stratification properties for decomposition classes .",
    "characterization of a sheet with dense @xmath25-decomposition class @xmath12 as the union of induced classes from @xmath12 .    in the lie algebra case",
    ", this also provides a new insight on these results .    in @xcite ,",
    "the connection between sheets of @xmath2 and sheets of @xmath6 was studied .",
    "in particular it was shown that , whenever sheets of @xmath2 are smooth , sheets of @xmath6 are also smooth .",
    "the last goal of this paper is the description of sheets of @xmath6 in the non - trivial symmetric lie algebra of type g@xmath0 .",
    "we make use of two approaches for this study . in section [ g2slsl ]",
    ", we study the subregular sheets through their slodowy slices .",
    "this provides the set - theoretical description of the sheets and describes the behavior of the singularities of @xmath23 through the intersection with @xmath6 . in section [ g24ality ]",
    ", we exploit the symmetry of @xmath2 making use of @xmath28-ality as described in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to construct a nice desingularization in @xmath29 of the singular sheet ( proposition [ desing ] ) , following the guidelines of @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that most of what is stated in section [ slosli ] and [ sliceind ] remains true in the more general setting of @xmath30-representation .",
    "however , the authors are unaware of references for a general theory of decomposition classes in this setting",
