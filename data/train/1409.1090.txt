    "unconventional superconductivity in heavy fermion metals often develops in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order@xcite .",
    "its understanding is intimately connected with that of the af quantum critical points ( qcps ) @xcite .",
    "traditional descriptions of heavy fermion quantum criticality are based on those for purely itinerant magnetism , in terms of the fluctuations of the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order parameter @xcite .",
    "studies in the recent past have emphasized the  beyond landau \" physics of kondo destruction @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "considerable progress has been made based on the extended dynamical mean field theory ( edmft ) solution of kondo lattice models @xcite .",
    "one of the important questions along this direction concerns the implications of these theoretical studies on the understanding of superconductivity .",
    "the edmft approach builds on the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , which was developed through the infinite dimensional limit of the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "dmft maps an interacting lattice problem to a single quantum impurity model coupled to a self consistent weiss field .",
    "the latter captures the environment as seen at the single - particle level , and is represented by a fermionic bath .",
    "dmft has made significant contributions to a variety of strongly correlated problems  @xcite , and has in particular provided significant new insights on the mott transition .",
    "the edmft approach treats inter - site density - density or spin - spin interactions , leading to a single impurity model coupled to self consistent fermionic and bosonic baths@xcite .",
    "it has been extensively applied to the study of af quantum critical heavy fermion metals  @xcite . for a kondo lattice ,",
    "the edmft approach yields a bose - fermi kondo model ( bfkm ) with self consistent bosonic and fermionic baths .",
    "kondo destruction arises from this approach .",
    "this may be seen already at the level of the bfkm in the absence of self consistency .",
    "the coupling of the local moment to the bosonic bath competes with the kondo effect , i.e. the tendency of singlet formation due to the af exchange coupling between the local moment and the fermionic bath .",
    "when the spectrum of the bosonic bath is sufficiently soft , corresponding to the spectral function being  sub - ohmic \" , this competition gives rise to the destruction of the kondo effect , in a way that is associated with the criticality of the bfkm  @xcite .",
    "studying this type of criticality in a variety of quantum impurity models has led to a number of new insights regarding kondo destruction qcps . for the lattice case , through the edmft equations ,",
    "the bosonic spectrum is particularly soft near the af qcp due to the critical slowing down , and one consistent solution is that the kondo destruction occurs at the af qcp .",
    "there is by now extensive experimental evidence for this type of beyond - landau qcp from experiments in heavy fermion metals , both in terms of a unusual scaling of the dynamical spin susceptibility in the quantum critical regime and a sudden jump of the fermi surface across the qcp  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to study the important problem of the interplay between this unconventional quantum criticality and superconductivity , a cluster generalization of the edmft is called for . in this manuscript",
    ", we develop such a formalism .    in dmft based approaches , incorporating real space correlations beyond a single site",
    "have naturally been done with the development of quantum cluster theories  @xcite . in this case , strongly correlated problems can be mapped to a quantum cluster model with self consistent fermionic baths and the interactions within the cluster are treated exactly .",
    "importantly , dynamical cluster theories incorporate non - perturbative corrections to dmft without introducing a non - causal self energy  @xcite .",
    "this can be formulated in real space which leads to cluster dmft ( cdmft )  @xcite , or in momentum space which is known as the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite ; there are other cluster embedding schemes possible such as the variational cluster approximation ( vca)@xcite . when the weiss fields are neglected these cluster schemes are no longer self consistent and reduce to cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) , which approximates lattice quantities by expanding about the isolated cluster limit  @xcite .",
    "a main advantage of dynamical cluster theories is the ability to account for various types of order not possible within dmft  @xcite .",
    "for example , a four site cluster can treat a d - wave superconducting order parameter as well as stripe charge or spin order .",
    "such a pairing mechanism is expected to be appropriate for , _",
    "e.g. _ , the cuprates and heavy fermion materials . in this case",
    ", any superconducting ground state will have cooper pairs formed between sites which can lead to a variety of different pairing symmetries , such as extended s - wave , p - wave or d - wave .    in this manuscript",
    ", we present a cluster extended dynamical mean field theory scheme that we dub c - edmft .",
    "we derive the equations by generalizing ref .   to the cluster case using a locator expansion about a dressed cluster limit .",
    "we formulate the equations in both real and momentum space .",
    "we introduce magnetic order in the same fashion as edmft in refs .",
    "distinct from dmft , and then generalize this approach to include superconductivity as well .",
    "we also construct the pairing correlation functions induced by magnetic interactions in the normal state within this approach .",
    "lastly , we use the formalism to derive effective impurity models associated with strongly correlated problems of central interest .",
    "we note that cluster generalizations of the edmft have been carried out in various forms in the past  @xcite .",
    "where there is overlap , our approach is consistent with these formulations .",
    "we will make the specific comparisons as we go through the derivation of our approach . in short , the c - edmft formalism developed here",
    "brings out two new aspects ( for definiteness , we will describe these with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ham ] ) in mind ) .",
    "first , it is the inter - site @xmath0 interactions which underlie both the magnetic and superconducting orders .",
    "such orders develop through decoupling the @xmath0 interaction term into the appropriate channels .",
    "second , the approach avoids double - counting the inter - site interaction by suppressing the induced inter - site interactions associated with the polarization of the fermonic bath by the order parameter . as a result",
    ", the @xmath1-dependence of the dynamical spin susceptibility arises through the @xmath0 interaction term , instead of the bare particle - hole bubble at the  special-@xmath1 \" ( as opposed to the  generic-@xmath1 \" , see section iii ) .",
    "these two aspects are in the same spirit as discussed for the case of the edmft @xcite .      for illustration purposes ,",
    "we consider a one band hubbard model with two body inter - site interactions on a generic lattice . @xmath2 where @xmath3 destroys an electron of spin @xmath4 at site @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the index @xmath8 runs over @xmath9 , where for @xmath10 ( or for @xmath11 ) the operator @xmath12 , is the spin operator , where @xmath13 is the @xmath8-pauli matrix for @xmath11 .",
    "in addition we consider the charge channel with @xmath14 , where the operator @xmath15 denotes the normal ordered density @xmath16 .",
    "we denote nearest neighbors by @xmath17 and only consider nearest neighbor hopping @xmath18 and two body exchange interaction @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the model reduces to the standard hubbard model with an onsite coulomb repulsion of strength @xmath21 .",
    "it is natural to extend these techniques to multi - band models and longer range interactions .",
    "a main focus of this work is a self consistent solution of the single particle greens function @xmath22 as well as the spin and charge susceptibilities @xmath23 . in general , for the single particle greens function , a perturbative expansion about the non - interacting limit yields the dyson equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fourier transform of @xmath18@xmath26 , @xmath27 is the chemical potential , @xmath28 is the single particle self energy , and we denote fermionic matsubara frequencies as @xmath29 .",
    "analogous to the single particle greens function , we introduce a spin and charge self energy @xmath30 which is defined in terms of each susceptibility as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier transform of @xmath19 and @xmath33 is a bosonic matsubara frequency .",
    "the spin / charge self energies specify how much their corresponding susceptibilities differ from a gaussian model where @xmath34 ( ref .  ) . in the following",
    "we will derive a self consistent c - edmft approach to approximate the lattice quantities @xmath28 and @xmath30 and in turn the single particle greens function and spin / charge susceptibilities .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we focus on the c - edmft equations in the absence of any order in section [ sec : ect ] , and those in the presence of magnetic order in section [ sec : mag - order ] .",
    "we then apply the approach to superconducting order and correlations in section [ sec : sup ] .",
    "we use the formalism to derive an effective cluster model in section [ sec : ecm ] .",
    "finally , we outline the relevant solution methods in section [ sec : sol_methods ] , discuss several pertinent points in section [ sec : dis ] , before concluding the paper in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "we begin by dividing the lattice of @xmath35 sites into clusters of size @xmath36 , where each lattice site is now labeled by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 labels the cluster and @xmath39 labels the sites within the cluster ( see figure  [ fig : cluster ] ) . in the following",
    "we will use upper case latin letters to denote cluster indices ( i.e. indices within the cluster ) and lower case letters to label each cluster .",

    ", width=216 ]      we will first derive the equations in real space .",
    "we first focus on a ground state with no broken symmetry , and will then generalize the equations to the case of magnetic order and superconductivity in sections [ sec : mag - order ] and [ sec : sup ] .",
    "we perform a locator expansion in @xmath57 and @xmath55 about the cluster limit  @xcite . the isolated cluster single particle greens function and susceptibilities",
    "are defined by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , where @xmath60 is the _ isolated _ cluster hamiltonian at cluster @xmath38 . in the",
    "following we consider problems that have translational invariance between clusters which implies each cluster correlation function is identical and we can drop the label @xmath38 .",
    "we now generalize the effective cumulant expansion of metzner  @xcite for the greens function and smith and si  @xcite for the susceptibilities from a single site to a cluster , which leads to matrix quantities . along these lines , we introduce the _ effective _ cluster greens function @xmath61 and spin / charge susceptibilities @xmath62 which are defined as the isolated cluster greens function and susceptibility ( in the @xmath8 channel ) with all local decorations that are irreducible by cutting a single @xmath63 and @xmath64 line respectively ( see figure  [ fig : dyson ] ) .",

    "we arrive at the following equations for the effective cluster correlation functions @xmath72 where the free isolated cluster greens function is @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the identity matrix in cluster indices .    the fact that both self energies are @xmath42 and @xmath67 independent implies they can be calculated by an effective cluster model .",
    "the effective cluster model can be obtained through a generalized cavity method  @xcite , by expanding the partition function in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 about a particular cluster @xmath75 and effectively integrating out all other degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads to the cluster action @xmath76 we have dropped the cluster label @xmath75 , defined the isolated cluster action as @xmath77 and introduced the effective weiss fields @xmath78 and @xmath79 that are related to lattice quantities by @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the greens function and spin susceptibility of the lattice with the cluster @xmath75 removed , and we have taken the cluster @xmath75 to be at the origin . generalizing the arguments of ref .   to the case of matrix cluster quantities",

    "one can generalize the arguments of refs .   to prove that the approach here has manifestly causal self energies for both @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is useful to consider a few limiting cases of the above equations .",
    "first , we note that setting @xmath89 and @xmath90 implies the effective cluster correlation functions reduce to the isolated cluster quantities , and the self energies are then completely determined by solving the isolated cluster problem .",
    "therefore , in the absence of weiss fields this approach reduces to cpt for both @xmath91 and @xmath92 and is no longer self consistent .",
    "this clarifies the meaning of keeping all local decorations for @xmath93 and @xmath94 and is necessary to properly introduce the dynamical weiss fields . in the limit of one site in the cluster @xmath95",
    ", the equations reduce to edmft ; this underscores the fact that the cluster theories incorporate spatial fluctuations beyond standard dynamical mean field theories .",
    "lastly , in the limit of large cluster sizes , @xmath96 the theory becomes exact . in this sense , extended dynamical cluster theories interpolates between the edmft and the exact answer as the cluster size is increased .",
    "after self consistency has been reached it is possible to restore translational invariance to the self energies and thereby the correlation functions by interpolating the cluster quantities .",
    "since the self energies are only defined for sites within the cluster ( or cluster momentum ) the interpolation scheme must respect the symmetry of the original lattice .",
    "following ref .",
    ", after the self consistent solution has been reached we interpolate the cluster self energies to obtain the lattice quantities with the estimation @xmath97 we then use these to determine the lattice greens function and spin susceptibility in equations ( [ eqn : g ] ) and ( [ eqn : chi ] ) .",
    "other interpolation schemes are possible as described in ref .",
    ", where each scheme preserves the symmetry of the lattice .    our equations without restoring the translational invariance have some similarities with those of ref .  , which invoked a different procedure .",
    "namely , a hubbard - stratonovich transformation decouples the inter site two body interaction term , and the hubbard - stratonovich field becomes a self consistent dynamic bosonic weiss field in the cluster limit .",
    "we also note that , in the absence of conduction electrons similar equations for the self consistent bosonic bath appeared in the construction for spin only models in ref .  .",
    "the momentum space construction parallels the dca formulation , which restores translation symmetry by giving the cluster periodic boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "this is achieved by modifying the cluster fourier transform to @xmath98_{{\\bf x}_i,{\\bf x}_j}&\\equiv&j^{\\alpha}(\\tilde{{\\bf q}})_{{\\bf x}_i,{\\bf x}_j}e^{-i\\tilde{{\\bf q}}\\cdot({\\bf x}_i-{\\bf x}_j ) } \\label{eqn : dcaft } \\\\",

    "this leads to periodic boundary conditions in the cluster and a coarse graining of the cluster quantities @xmath99 and @xmath100 and in turn , the inter - cluster quantities become @xmath101 and @xmath102 . applying the dca fourier",
    "transform to equations ( [ eqn : c - g ] ) and ( [ eqn : c - chi ] ) leads to matrix equations that are diagonal in momentum space . here",
    "we specify the equations for the spin susceptibility , with the equations for the greens function being identical in form to those of dca .",
    "we have a dyson like equation @xmath103 with an effective spin cumulant @xmath104 the weiss field is specified by @xmath105 with the self consistent equation @xmath106",
    "lastly , the cluster action is now diagonal in cluster momentum , which leads to @xmath107 where the isolated cluster action [ in equation ( [ eqn : isolated - action ] ) ] is written in cluster momentum @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "these equations are similar to those of ref .  , where the edmft approach was adopted through a hubbard - stratonovich transformation that decouples the inter - site interaction terms , and then the dca approach is applied .",
    "in both the real space and momentum space formulations , it is seen that the momentum dependence of the dynamical lattice spin susceptibility reflects the momentum dependence associated with the inter - site interaction @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is similar to what happens in the edmft @xcite , with the advantage that the inter - site interactions that give rise to the momentum dependence of the dynamical susceptibility also appear in the self - consistent dynamical equations .",
    "it is useful to stress that the momentum dependence of the lattice susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase does not reflect that of the bare particle - hole bubble @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the standard dmft and cluster generalizations , where the bare particle - hole bubble is responsible for the momentum dependence of the lattice susceptibility , which we discuss in detail in the following section .",
    "before we discuss the cluster generalization of symmetry broken phases within edmft , we find it very useful to review the different schemes used to introduce magnetic order in the single site case . in the context of the edmft ,",
    "there are two ways to introduce magnetic order into the system , namely whether or not the magnetic order parameter polarizes the single particle weiss field @xmath109 ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that allowing @xmath109 to polarize amounts to keeping the particle hole bubble contribution , @xmath110^{-1}-[\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph},{\\mathrm{loc}}}(\\omega)]^{-1}$ ] , to the spin susceptibility  @xcite ( where the particle hole bubbles are constructed using the full lattice and local greens function respectively obtained with dmft and the brackets @xmath111 $ ] denote a matrix form  @xcite ) . within the context of dmft , such a term will exist due to the distinction between `` normal '' and `` special '' @xmath1 s ; _ cf . _",
    "however , due to promoting @xmath0 to the same level as @xmath18 within the edmft , there are no special @xmath1 s allowed , since this would make @xmath112 which would diverge in the large @xmath113 limit .",
    "the absence of any special @xmath1 s implies @xmath110^{-1}=[\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph},{\\mathrm{loc}}}(\\omega)]^{-1}$ ] , and the particle hole bubble contribution vanishes  @xcite . keeping the particle hole bubble within the edmft amounts to double counting contributions from the spin - spin interaction  @xcite .    in the following section , we focus on the cluster edmft case .",
    "this is to be contrasted with dca , which parallels dmft and therefore retains the distinction between special and generic @xmath114 s and a similar particle hole contribution to the spin susceptibility , namely @xmath115^{-1}-[\\bm{\\chi}_{\\mathrm{ph},{\\mathrm{loc}}}(\\omega)]^{-1}$ ] ( here the particle hole bubble is constructed with the full single particle lattice and local cluster greens function respectively , obtained within dca and the bold denotes matrices in cluster momentum )  @xcite . as in edmft ,",
    "the cluster edmft promotes @xmath55 to the same level as @xmath57 .",
    "generalizing the edmft argument  @xcite to the cluster case we conclude that there should only be generic @xmath116 s .",
    "this amounts to not allowing the single particle weiss field @xmath117 to polarize ( i.e. is @xmath4 independent ) , and is equivalent to the suppression of the particle hole bubble contribution .",
    "we now consider magnetic order with an ordering wave vector @xmath118 within the channel @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "the cluster chosen must be large enough to accommodate the type of magnetic order under consideration , for example a four site cluster can describe the collinear af order with @xmath121 whereas a two site cluster can only treat either ferro- or af order .",
    "this then implies that the order pattern within each cluster must be the same and therefore @xmath122 .",
    "we will consider the equations in real space and momentum space consecutively .",
    "after separating @xmath123 into inter- and intra - cluster parts we treat the cluster interactions exactly and normal order the interaction between clusters , via @xmath124 .",
    "all of the previous steps apply , but now we perform the locator expansion in the normal ordered interaction between clusters @xmath125 .",
    "this corresponds to adding an additional term to the cluster action @xmath126 and the local magnetic field is determined self consistently from @xmath127m_{y},\\ ] ] where @xmath128 and the average is over the cluster action .    in momentum space , this approach amounts to adding to the action @xmath129 now the local field is given by @xmath130 m \\label{eqn : hloc - q}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 and in this case the inter - cluster interaction is @xmath132 where we have coarse grained the cluster interaction as described previously .",
    "it is useful to note that , in the limit of no dynamical weiss field , the mean field equations for the self consistent field @xmath133 reduce to that of cluster weiss mean field theory . here",

    "this approach will also provide insight into the way a superconducting long range order can be incorporated in c - edmft . in order to treat an ordering wave vector more naturally",

    "first we observe that if we include a dynamic source field for each matsubara frequency @xmath138 , we must normal order every frequency modes instead of the static mode only , by writing @xmath139 , as a result equation ( [ eqn : dcaordered ] ) will become @xmath140 with @xmath141 \\langle s^{\\lambda}_{{\\bf q}_{\\mathrm{or}},n } \\rangle $ ] .",
    "we introduce an additional term , @xmath142 , to the lattice action which couples the @xmath143 component of the spin operators at wave vector @xmath144 to a dynamic source field @xmath145 mapping this into the cluster action , and assuming that the weiss fields can not be polarized ( due to the absence of any special @xmath67 s ) , we end up adding _ only _ one extra term @xmath146 to equation ( [ eqn : dcaordered ] ) , namely @xmath147 here @xmath148 , which is defined in the cluster , need to be distinguished from @xmath149 , which is defined on the lattice , since we have @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively .",

    "we will show in the appendix how the additional particle hole bubble contribution to the expression for @xmath167 , forbidden by the absence of special @xmath116 s , is introduced if we allow the weiss field to be polarized .",
    "these considerations have important implications for the incorporation of superconductivity into the formalism , which we turn to in the following section .",
    "we now apply the approach to the study of superconductivity , with the pairing driven by the spin - spin interaction in equation ( [ eqn : ham ] ) .",
    "we first focus on an af ising interaction with @xmath168 and set the other @xmath123 to zero .",
    "the af interaction @xmath0 favors pairing of electrons with opposite spins ; a parallel consideration can be made for the case of ferromagnetic interactions , which favors pairing between electrons of the same spins .",

    "the formalism we have discussed so far also applies to a variety of strongly correlated problems aside from the hamiltonian we have been considering in equation ( [ eqn : ham ] ) .",
    "one such example is a two band model , namely the anderson lattice hamiltonian appropriate for the description of heavy fermion materials  @xcite .",
    "the model describes a band of conduction electrons hybridized with a band of localized , highly correlated @xmath230-electrons and is defined as @xmath231 as usual , we have explicitly included an ising rkky interaction between the @xmath230-electron spins .",
    "the rkky and kondo interactions compete , and tuning their ratio can lead to a quantum phase transition between a heavy fermi liquid and an antiferromagnet . in certain cases ,",
    "the qcp is of the sdw type , where the heavy quasiparticles remain intact across the transition and undergo a sdw transition",
    ". in other cases , the sdw description fails , and the physics of critical kondo destruction comes into play .    focusing on the normal state properties , applying the extended dynamical cluster theory of section  [ subsec : ectm ] in momentum space we arrive at the effective cluster action @xmath232 for the case of 2-d af exchange fluctuations , the divergence of the spin susceptibility at the ordering wave vector implies [ through the self consistent equation ( [ eqn : self - chi - q ] ) ] that the local spin susceptibility with cluster momentum @xmath135 is also ( logarithmically ) divergent  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a spin weiss field associated with the critical momentum channel @xmath233 that develops a sub - ohmic spectral density @xmath234 .",
    "based on universality , we can regard the effective cluster model in equation ( [ eqn : c - alaction ] ) with a sub - ohmic density of states for the ordered channel , as an effective model that contains both kondo destruction and pairing correlations induced from af exchange interactions .",
    "for the simplest case of @xmath235 , and keeping only the critical degrees of freedom [ i.e. only the weiss field in the ordered channel @xmath233 ] we arrive at a simplified model to study pairing correlations near a kondo destroyed qcp .",
    "this model was proposed and solved in ref .   using a combination of continuous time quantum monte carlo and the numerical renormalization group .",
    "it was shown that the cluster pairing susceptibility @xmath237 is enhanced at the kondo destruction qcp .",
    "it will be important to consider the full self consistent solution and determine if local quantum criticality with kondo destruction survives finite size cluster corrections and if so , how large @xmath238 is near the local qcp .",
    "another strongly correlated problem of central interest is the extended hubbard model , which adds to the standard hubbard model an inter - site density - density interaction .",
    "we note in passing that incorporating a spin orbit coupling can lead to topologically non - trivial ground states in the presence of interactions  @xcite .",
    "the extended hubbard model is thought to be the appropriate model to describe certain types of organic superconductors , stripe charge order in the cuprates and different types of mott transitions .",
    "in addition , when the inter - site interaction is attractive ( @xmath239 ) , the model may also feature inter - site pairing and , in the presence of a spin - orbit coupling , topological superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath240 where we have generalized the tight - binding hopping terms to a spin dependent hopping matrix @xmath241 ; this form is sufficiently general to allow for a spin orbit coupling term and keep @xmath242 that are not necessarily nearest neighbors .",
    "tuning the ratio of @xmath243 can lead to a variety of quantum phase transitions between a fermi liquid , a band insulator , and a mott insulator . whereas tuning the strength of the spin orbit coupling can lead to topological transitions between a band and topological insulator . applying",
    "the formalism of section  [ subsec : ectr ] leads to the effective cluster action @xmath244 studying the different types of quantum phase transitions in the effective cluster model alone [ i.e. , without implementing the self - consistency ] can lead to significant new insights regarding behavior of the qcps in the lattice problem .",
    "in other words , the effective cluster model of equation ( [ eqn : c - action - eh ] ) serves as a simplified model that can provide insights into different types of mott transitions , superconductivity and even interacting topological phase transitions .",
    "the self consistent cluster dynamical mean field equations form a set of highly non - linear equations .",
    "their solution requires an accurate and reliable solution of the cluster impurity model , which is iteratively solved .",
    "there are analytical tools and computational methods that are suitable for studying the cluster impurity models . from a computational perspective , solving the cluster impurity models represents the most extensive efforts of solving the self consistent equations . in the presence of a phase transition , the number of iterations necessary to solve the equations can become quite large due to a `` critical slowing down '' . in this case",
    ", it is very useful to use mixing techniques that are well known in the context of density functional theory , in order to reduce the number of iterations that are needed to achieve self consistency  @xcite .",
    "the cluster model can be solved using , for example the exact diagonalization ( ed ) , the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and quantum monte carlo methods .    including bosonic baths in diagonalization based techniques can be done , but it requires a truncation of the infinite bosonic hilbert space .",
    "in addition , the presence of numerous bosonic baths can make such an approach quite computationally demanding .",
    "however , this does not rule out ed and nrg techniques , provided there is some physical intuition of which bosonic bath is going to drive the system through a quantum phase transition . then retaining this single bosonic bath is necessary to capture the critical universal properties , while the other baths serve to renormalize the effective model parameters .",
    "the recently developed continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) has the advantage that the bosons are traced out and the algorithm is numerically exact .",
    "these methods have been adapted to treat scalar bosonic baths that interact with the impurities charge  @xcite or spin  @xcite degrees of freedom .",
    "the case of a vector bosonic bath  @xcite has also been studied .",
    "recently , the ct - qmc has been generalized to a two impurity  @xcite model in the presence of a single bosonic bath . as the additional bosonic baths that arise in the c - edmft treatment commute with each other , the method in ref .",
    "can naturally be used to solve the c - edmft equations to high accuracy .",
    "generalizations to larger cluster is still possible within such a framework , provided the algorithm does nt suffer from a sign problem arising from the fermionic degrees of freedom . as described in section",
    "v , for the minimal case of the two - impurity c - edmft approach to the periodic anderson model , in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic qcp , it would be adequate to keep only a single bosonic bath that is coupled to the staggered combination of the local - moment spins in the cluster .",
    "the method of ref .   then makes it feasible to study the quantum critical behavior of the periodic anderson model .",
    "in this work we have derived a cluster edmft formulation by a locator expansion about a dressed cluster limit .",
    "an alternative derivation can also be done using a baym - kadanoff functional  @xcite . in this case",
    "the generating functional of the grand potential is ( focusing on one of the two particle channels ) @xmath245 & = & \\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\log ( { \\bf g})\\right]- \\mathrm{tr}\\left[{\\bf g}(\\bf{g}_0^{-1}-{\\bf g}^{-1})\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\log ( \\bm{\\chi})\\right]+\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\bm{\\chi}(\\bm{\\chi}_0^{-1}-\\bm{\\chi}^{-1})\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\phi[{\\bf g},\\bm{\\chi}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the stationary conditions @xmath246 .",
    "the self energies are then given by @xmath247/\\delta { \\bf g}=\\bm{\\sigma}$ ] , @xmath247/\\delta \\bm{\\chi}={\\bf m}$ ] .",
    "within the cluster approximation , the self energies are calculated from an effective cluster model .",
    "therefore , the approximation that the functional @xmath248 is only a functional of @xmath249 and @xmath250 leads to the cluster edmft equations .",
    "therefore , analogous to the edmft approach  @xcite , the c - edmft approach is also conserving  @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed in the introduction , a main success of edmft compared to dmft has been in its solution to the kondo lattice hamiltonian and the theory of local quantum criticality  @xcite .",
    "this rests on treating the rkky interactions between the local moments in a dynamical fashion , through the self - consistent bosonic bath .",
    "the self - consistent solution yields an unconventional qcp with a dynamical spin susceptibility satisfying @xmath251 scaling and anomalous dynamical critical exponent , similar to what has been observed in quantum - critical heavy - fermion metals  @xcite . for this result , it is important that the mapped bose - fermi kondo model itself contains a kondo - destruction qcp  @xcite .",
    "studies of the two impurity bose - fermi anderson model in ref .   have shown that a kondo - destruction qcp persists , with similar scaling properties for the staggered dynamical spin susceptibility .",
    "this raises the prospect that the c - edmft approach discussed here will be able to study the interplay between the unconventional quantum critical normal state and superconductivity . as discussed earlier in the paper ,",
    "such an interplay is important to the understanding of heavy fermion superconductivity .",
    "we note that the dynamical treatment of the rkky interactions differentiates edmft and c - edmft from dmft , which does not treat the rkky interactions beyond a static mean field approximation , as well as the cluster - dmft  @xcite , which treats the rkky interactions within the cluster in a dynamical fashion , but does not do so for those interactions outside of a chosen cluster .",
    "in this manuscript we have presented a new cluster extended dynamical mean field approach .",
    "we have developed the equations in both real and momentum space , incorporating magnetic order and superconductivity .",
    "we have also determined the form of the superconducting correlation functions in the normal state .",
    "we have then used the formalism to derive effective cluster models that are relevant to heavy fermion metals and mott - hubbard systems . in particular",
