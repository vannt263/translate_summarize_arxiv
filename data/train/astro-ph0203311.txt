    "in all x - ray observatory missions a great deal effort goes into the calibration of the scientific instruments with goals of an absolute accuracy usually better than , or much better than 10% , depending on the quantity ( e.g. , energy scale , relative area , total flux , etc . ) .",
    "the calibrations are usually based on extensive ground calibration data ( which are never as complete as one would like ) coupled with extensive in - flight observations of celestial objects ( which are always problematic as nature has not seen fit to provide ideal calibration sources ) .",
    "in addition , there is the fact that instrument responses can and will vary with time ( e.g. , the increasing charge transfer inefficiency , cti , of ccds ) .",
    "thus instrument calibration is therefore a long - term endeavor where occasionally the final step is just to declare victory and move on . as a final editorial comment",
    ", the astronomical community owes a great debt of gratitude to those individuals who undertake this very difficult task .",
    "but back to the issue at hand , one practical way of examining the reliability of calibrations is to compare the results of various observations of celestial objects using various instruments .",
    "this at least provides an estimate of the relative errors between the different instruments .",
    "( there is an old joke from the early x - ray missions that nobody has ever measured the spectrum of the crab as the calibrations of some instruments were fudged to give the accepted results . )",
    "while simultaneous observations of the same source by different instruments are ideal , for spectral calibration comparisons independent observations of spectrally constant sources can be substituted .",
    "thus distant supernova remnants and high redshift clusters are the targets of choice . however , there are problematic issues with both types of sources , and nature has not provided convenient `` standard candles '' for x - ray astronomy .",
    "snrs can have complex line spectra and those in the milky way which are small enough in solid angle to be useful are distant and therefore heavily absorbed .",
    "high redshift clusters are not particularly bright so the photon statistics can be quite limited .",
    "this paper will present results from three sources which provide useful results but all suffer from limitations noted above .",
    "they are : 1 ) the galactic snr g21.5 - 0.9 which is heavily absorbed but provides a constant power law spectrum visible from @xmath1  kev .",
    "2 ) the smc snr 1e0102.2 - 7219 which suffers relatively little absorption but has a soft , very complicated , and line - rich spectrum .",
    "3 )  the high redshift cluster ms1054.4 - 0321 which also suffers little absorption , has a relatively simple thermal spectrum , but has limited photon statistics .",
    "not all instruments have observations of all of the sources , which is another limitation for this study .",
    "to provide the pedestrian s view of the current status of the cross calibration , only publicly released software and calibration data files have been used for this work . for _ xmm - newton _ epic data , sas v5.2",

    "pspc data were extracted , and rmfs ( where necessary , otherwise standard rmfs from the public calibration data base were used , ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) and arfs were created using the heasoft software package + ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/corp/software.html ) .",

    "( note , for some of the `` science '' of this source , see the poster papers in these proceedings by la palombara and mereghetti , and bocchino and bandiera . )",
    "data for this source are available from all instruments , although the _ rosat _ pspc observation is of limited utility because the source is so heavily absorbed . because of the relatively poor angular resolution of the _ asca _ instruments , extraction regions large enough to include the entire remnant were used ( 165  extraction radii for _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ , and _ rosat _ data and 240  for the _ asca _ data ) . source and",
    "background spectra were extracted for all instruments .",
    "the data were fit over the @xmath3  kev energy range with variation in the endpoints due to the individual spectral responses of the various instruments .",
    "a simple absorbed power law spectrum was first fit simultaneously to the data with only the overall normalization being allowed to vary between the various instruments .",
    "the fits are displayed in figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : g21-all - spec ] .",
    "while the fits are a bit rough below 1  kev , at higher energies they look quite good .",
    "( at energies below 1  kev interstellar absorption has removed most x - rays from the spectrum so what are typically detected are events which have lost some of their energy due to incomplete charge collection by the ccds and electronics . )",
    "the fitted values for the relative fluxes ( scaled to the average value ) are in good agreement and range from 0.89 ( _ rosat _ pspc ) to 1.07 , with epic and acis - s3 values in the range 1.00 to 1.07 .",
    "figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : g21-all - con ] shows the confidence contours for the fitted values of the power law index and absorbing column density .",
    "the spectral parameters of the epic pn and mos detectors were fit simultaneously only allowing the normalizations to vary .",
    "this was also done for the sis and gis data to improve the statistics .",
    "the average results for the epic data are completely consistent with those of the sis .",
    "the acis - s3 and epic slopes agree but there is a @xmath4% difference in the fitted values for the absorption column densities . the gis and epic results for the absorption column densities agree well but there is a difference of @xmath5 in the fitted values for the slope .",
    "figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : g21-epicacis - con ] shows a confidence contour plot for the epic and acis - s3 data when the epic data are fit independently .",

    "is a snr in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "it is beautifully resolved in the _ chandra _ data as a shell - like remnant .",
    "it s spectrum is soft and line - dominated , and very difficult to model short of fitting a vast number of gaussians to the data .",
    "unfortunately , it was not feasible to use the pn data from the epic observation as the positioning of the source for the advantage of the rgs caused part of the remnant to fall on a gap between the ccds .    for the fits two absorbed apec models ( see http://hea-www.harvard.edu/apec/ ) with variable abundances were used .",
    "the data were fit over the @xmath6  kev band , and the fit was not particularly significant .",
    "however , the fits can still be used to compare the relative normalizations . as can be seen in figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : e0102-all - spec ] ( and table  [ ssnowden - wa2_tab : summary ] )",
    ", the relative normalizations range from 0.92 to 1.07 , with the values for the acis - s3 and mos detectors ranging from 0.96 to 1.05 .    as an aside ,",
    "note the difference between the energy resolution of acis - s3 ( green curve in figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : e0102-all - spec ] ) and mos spectra ( the black and red curves ) due to the differences in the response between backside and frontside illuminated ccds .",
    "( figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : ms ] ) is a high redshift cluster in a direction of low galactic column density .",
    "the limitation for this object as a good calibration source is its low brightness and therefore poorer statistics .",
    "reasonable data are available for the epic mos and pn , acis - s3 , and sis .",
    "while the sis data are nt particularly useful for constraining the spectral parameters , they do provide a reasonable flux comparison .    figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : ms1054-all - spec ] shows the spectral fits and relative fluxes for the epic , acis - s3 , and sis data . for these data",
    "an absorbed thermal model ( @xcite ) was fit where the abundance was allowed to vary .",
    "for the epic and acis - s3 data , figure  [ ssnowden - wa2_fig : ms1054-epicacis - con ] shows the confidence contours for the fitted values for the temperature and absorption column density .",
    "the epic data were fit simultaneously to improve the statistical results .",
    "the fitted values for the parameters are completely consistent .",
    "table  [ ssnowden - wa2_tab : summary ] gives a summary of the relative flux normalizations for the simultaneous spectral fits for the three objects . in all cases the full range in the _ xmm - newton _ and",
    "_ chandra _ values is better than @xmath4% , which is fairly remarkable at this early a stage in the missions . when the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data are included the full range is still @xmath7% .",
    "one consistent systematic difference in the data is that the fluxes measured by the epic pn instrument are @xmath8% lower than the fluxes measured by the epic mos .",
    "this discrepancy is also seen in the results of griffiths ( this workshop ) for the hard band , and both his paper and that of haberl should be noted for their comparisons of the epic mos and pn calibrations .",

    "first , the calibrations and software were current as of the end of november , 2001 .",
    "both the calibration and the software implementation for _ chandra _ and especially for _ xmm - newton _ are changing with time , almost invariably for the better .",
    "second , a fudge was included for the acis - s3 fits with a carbon k@xmath12 absorption edge of optical depth 1.0 being added to attempt to account for a recently observed systematic discrepancy in the area calibration .",
    "ciao software and calibration data are being modified to include this effect .",
    "third , there are clear sensitivities to the energy range , background selection , spectral model , which data are being fit , and what parameters are being fit simultaneously . but this is expected and one of the challenges in trying to separate the `` calibration '' from the `` science '' .",
