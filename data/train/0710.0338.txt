    "<S> the high - temperature expansion of the spin - spin correlation function of the two - dimensional classical xy ( planar rotator ) model on the square lattice is extended by three terms , from order 21 through order 24 , and analyzed to improve the estimates of the critical parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> tests of increasing accuracy  @xcite of the bkt theory  @xcite of the two - dimensional xy model critical behavior have been made possible by the steady improvements of the computers performances and the progress in the numerical approximation algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> however , the critical parameters of this model have not yet been determined with a precision comparable to that reached for the usual power - law critical phenomena , due to the complicated and peculiar nature of the critical singularities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore any effort at improving the accuracy of the available numerical methods by stretching them towards their ( present ) limits should be welcome . after extending the high - temperature(ht ) expansions of the model in successive steps  @xcite from order @xmath0 to @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> we present here a further extension by three orders for the expansions of the spin - spin correlation on the square lattice and perform a first brief analysis of our data for the susceptibility and the second - moment correlation - length . </S>",
    "<S> more results and further extensions both for the square and the triangular lattice@xcite will be presented elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> our study strengthens the support of the main results of the bkt theory already coming from the analysis of shorter series and suggests a closer agreement with recent high - precision simulation studies@xcite of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian    @xmath2    with @xmath3 a two - component unit vector at the site @xmath4 of a square lattice , describes a system of @xmath5 spins with nearest - neighbor interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> computing the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath6 ( for all values of @xmath7 for which the ht expansion coefficients are non - trivial within the maximum order reached ) , as series expansion in the variable @xmath8 , enables us to evaluate the expansions of the @xmath9-th order spherical moments of the correlation function : @xmath10    and in particular the reduced ferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath11 . in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> we can form the second - moment correlation length : @xmath14    our results for the nearest - neighbor correlation function ( or energy @xmath15 per link ) are :    @xmath16    for the susceptibility we have : @xmath17    for the second moment of the correlation function we have : @xmath18    the coefficients of order less than 22 were already tabulated in refs.@xcite , but for completeness we report all known terms . as implied by eq.([hamilt ] ) , the normalization of these series reduces to that of our earlier papers@xcite by the change @xmath19 .    </S>",

    "<S> let us assume that @xmath25 as expected , so that @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[figlograpp ] gives a suggestive visual test of the asymptotic behavior of some ratio sequences @xmath45 by comparing them with eq.([ratas ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the four lowest continuous curves interpolating the data points are obtained by separate three - parameter fits of the ratio sequences @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 to the asymptotic form @xmath50 of eq.([ratas ] ) . in the same figure , the two upper sets of points are obtained by extrapolating the alternate - ratio sequence for the susceptibility , first in terms of @xmath51 and then in terms of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath53 indicated by the fits of the ratio sequences , range between 0.5592 and 0.5611 .    </S>",
    "<S> a more accurate analysis can be based on the simple remark that , near the critical point , by eq.([xias ] ) and ( [ momas ] ) ( or eq.([momasb ] ) ) , one has @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if @xmath25 , the relative strength of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 singularities in the function @xmath57 is determined by the value of the constant @xmath58 . if we choose @xmath59 , the function @xmath60 is approximately dominated by a simple pole and we can expect that the differential approximants ( das)@xcite will be able to determine with higher accuracy not only the position , but also the exponent of the critical singularity . using inhomogeneous second - order das of @xmath60 , we can locate the critical singularity at @xmath61 . by analysing in the same way the series data truncated to order 21 which were previously available , we would get the estimate @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent estimate @xmath63 had been obtained in earlier independent@xcite studies of the same series using pad approximants or first - order das . </S>",
    "<S> older studies@xcite of slightly shorter series also indicated values of @xmath53 in the same range , but with notably larger uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> thus our new series results indicate a stabilization and a sizable reduction of the spread for the @xmath53 estimates . </S>",
    "<S> our uncertainty estimates are generally taken as the width of the distribution of the values of @xmath53 in the appropriate class of das . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[figbetacda2 ] shows the singularity distribution ( open histogram ) of the set of quasi - diagonal das which yield our new estimate . </S>",
    "<S> these are chosen as the approximants @xmath64 $ ] with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have taken @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the class of das can be varied with no significant variation of the final estimates , for example by further restricting the extent of off - diagonality , or by varying the minimal degree of the polynomial coefficients in the das . </S>",
    "<S> no limitations have been imposed on the exponents of the singular terms or on the background terms in the das in order to avoid biasing the @xmath53 estimates . </S>",
    "<S> should we require that the exponent of the most singular term in the approximants differs from -1 , for example , by less than @xmath69 , we would obtain @xmath70 , well within the uncertainty of our previous unrestricted estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical dashed line in fig.[figbetacda2 ] shows the value @xmath71 suggested by the simulation of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although no explicit indication of an uncertainty comes with this estimate , an upper bound to its error might be guessed from the statement@xcite that the simulation can exclude values larger or equal than @xmath72 for the inverse critical temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> biasing with @xmath61 the set previously specified of second - order das of @xmath60 , leads to the exponent estimate @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[figbetacda2 ] also shows the distribution of the exponent estimates ( hatched histogram ) from this biased set . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty we have reported for @xmath24 accounts not only for the width of its distribution shown in fig.[figbetacda2 ] , but also for the variation of its central value as the bias value of @xmath53 is varied in the uncertainty interval of the critical inverse temperature . essentially the same value of @xmath24 would be obtained from the analysis of a series truncated to order 21 .    </S>",
    "<S> while , as one should expect , the da estimate of @xmath53 is rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath58 , the estimate of the exponent @xmath24 and the width of its distribution are fairly improved by our choice of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> taking for example @xmath74 , we would find @xmath75 , which shows how the convergence of the exponent estimates is slowed down by the more complicated singularity structure of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> similar values of @xmath24 were found in previous studies of shorter series . </S>",
    "<S> probably for the same reason , also the central values of the @xmath77 estimates obtained from the usual indicators are still slightly larger than expected . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by studying the function @xmath78 ( or analogous functions of different moments ) , we can infer @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the function@xcite @xmath80 and its first derivative are also interesting indicators of the value of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath81 , pad approximants and das do not detect any singular behavior of @xmath82 or of its derivative as @xmath83 , thus confirming the complete cancellation of the leading singularity in @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this behavior seems to exclude the form eq.([momas ] ) of the corrections which implies the presence of weak subleading singularities , while it is compatible with eq.([momasb ] ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis suggests that , in spite of their diversity , the ht extended series approach and the latest most extensive simulation are competitive and lead to consistent numerical estimates of the highest accuracy so far possible . </S>"
