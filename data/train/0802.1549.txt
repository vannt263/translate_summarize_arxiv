    "in the three articles @xcite , m. douglas , b. shiffman , and s. zelditch presented their research into the statistics of critical points of random holomorphic sections of line bundles over complex manifolds .",
    "this line of research was initially motivated by the vacuum selection problem in string theory , and thus there was much discussion in these papers about the application of these statistics to string theory and related fields .",
    "however , this research is also of independent interest from a geometric point of view .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to prove the main conjecture in @xcite which concerns the purely geometric consideration of determining the metric dependence and asymptotic minimization of the expected number of critical points of random sections of positive line bundles .",
    "while it is clear that the number of critical points of a given holomorphic section will vary with the metric , it is not clear whether the same is true for the expected number of critical points of a random section .",
    "therefore , in @xcite , the authors performed an asymptotic analysis of the expected number @xmath0 of critical points of random holomorphic sections of @xmath4 in order to determine the metric dependence of this statistic .",
    "they showed that the asymptotic expansion of @xmath0 is topologically invariant to at least two orders in @xmath1 , but that the third term in the expansion is a sum of a topological invariant and a universal constant , @xmath2 , times the calabi functional @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature of the khler form @xmath7 .",
    "the authors derived a complicated integral formula for @xmath2 and , based on their calculations in low dimensions and a heuristic argument , conjectured that @xmath8 for all @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we will prove their conjecture .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 does not vanish proves that the expansion is non - topological , with a metric dependence in the third term for all @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 is positive proves that , whenever it exists , the calabi extremal metric asymptotically minimizes @xmath9 .",
    "it would seem likely that metrics which minimize the expected number of critical points would be ideally suited for the vacuum selection problem .",
    "in this paper we consider the @xmath1th tensor power of a positive hermitian line bundle @xmath10 over a compact khler manifold of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the khler form is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath11 is the curvature form of the metric on the bundle .",
    "for a holomorphic section @xmath12 , we consider the connection critical points given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is chosen to be the chern connection of @xmath15 .",
    "we will use @xmath16 to denote the set of critical points of @xmath17 .    in general , the critical point equation given above",

    "we can write @xmath19 and then @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the khler potential . from this",
    "we see that the critical point equation in the local frame is @xmath22 , which is holomorphic only when @xmath23 is .",
    "therefore the cardinality of @xmath16 is a non - constant random variable on the space @xmath24 .",
    "next , we endow the space @xmath24 with the gaussian measure @xmath25 given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is lebesgue measure and @xmath28 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath24 relative to the inner product @xmath29 induced by @xmath15 on @xmath24 .",

    "since the critical points of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath14 are the same as those of the real - valued function @xmath37 , we can consider the morse indices of the critical points in @xmath16 . to this end , we let @xmath38 denote the expected number of critical points of morse index @xmath35 . it follows that @xmath39    in @xcite , the authors derived the complete asymptotic expansion of @xmath38 .",

    "we then used a variant of the selberg integral formula to obtain an exact formula for the @xmath50 case and , finally , showed that the value of the integral decreased as @xmath35 increased using a change of variable argument .",

    "we will focus our attention on the constant @xmath56 .",
    "we see from corollary [ dsztheo2 ] that the first two terms in the expansion are topological and that the only non - topological part of the third term is @xmath57 times the calabi functional @xmath5 .",
    "hence , in order to determine the metric dependence of the expansion we will need to evaluate @xmath57 .    as the analysis is simplified by treating the contributions from critical points of different morse indices separately , the following integral formula for @xmath58 was derived in @xcite .",

    "although it would be possible to calculate the exact formulas for one or two more cases , these would be extremely complicated and we would be no closer to our goal of showing that @xmath78 for all @xmath3 .",

    ", we would not expect @xmath89 to have an upper bound as @xmath90 varies over @xmath87 , however it is bounded from below by @xmath91 .",

    "we note that by results in @xcite all critical points of the calabi functional are local minima .",

    "we recall that from lemma [ l2 ] we have @xmath80 where @xmath215    for each @xmath35 , we make the change of variables @xmath216 in the integral over @xmath217 above .",
    "this change of variables is a composition of the following two changes of variables : @xmath218 and @xmath219 these changes take @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively , and thus all of the integrals will now be over a common region of integration , @xmath222 .    under this change of variables we see that @xmath223 is unchanged and that @xmath224 @xmath225 and @xmath226 here we have let @xmath227 to simplify the notation .",
    "therefore , since the absolute value of the jacobian is 1 , we have @xmath228 where @xmath229 and @xmath230    next we see that making the change @xmath161 in does not change the value of the integrand on the region over which we are integrating .",
    "we make this change and now the integrand is symmetric under permutations of @xmath162 , so we can take the integral over @xmath163 .",
