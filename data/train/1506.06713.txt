    "it is generally believed that einstein gravity is not a complete theory and therefore it should be modified . in this regard",
    ", the introduction of higher curvature terms has been a natural choice by many researchers , motivated partly by its connection with fundamental concepts such as string theory @xcite . among various contributions of higher curvature terms ,",
    "a function of the ricci scalar is the most simplest extension ; such model can be transformed to a scalar - tensor gravity model as well as einstein gravity via a conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "this is commonly referred to as @xmath0 gravity .",
    "since @xmath0 gravity is transformable to a brans - dicke type theory @xcite , @xmath0 gravity is in general easier to control compared to the other general higher curvature corrections .",
    "this means that the behavior of the ricci scalar can be understood from the dynamics of the effective gravitational coupling , i.e. , the brans - dicke field .",
    "thus , @xmath0 gravity can provide a natural motivation for the choice of certain shape of a scalar field potential in the einstein frame that may be useful for an inflationary model @xcite or a dark energy model for late time cosmology @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the brans - dicke field will be determined by its potential that depends on the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "there is , however , a shortcoming of such an approach . if the shape of @xmath0 of a model is unwisely chosen , then it may result in a cusp in the potential of the brans - dicke field ; this may imply the divergence of the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "if a region has a divergent ricci scalar , then it should mean a singularity .",
    "however , since this is due to an unwise choice of @xmath0 , such singularity may be fictitious and it may mean that there should be a way to regularize it .",
    "we call this as the @xmath0-induced singularity or the cusp singularity @xcite .",
    "the follows are known results in the literature :    * many dark energy models of @xmath0 gravity contain a cusp singularity . in order to obtain a stable and non - vanishing ( de sitter ) local minimum",
    ", one often has to fabricate the shape of the effective potential of the brans - dicke field ; equivalently , one has to tune a form of @xmath0 @xcite . for this , the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) corrections have often been introduced , which nevertheless become the origin of the trouble . *",
    "if the correction term is quadratic , i.e. , @xmath3 , then this cusp singularity can be ameliorated @xcite .",
    "such a correction term is highly motivated as a viable model for inflation @xcite . *",
    "if the cusp singularity is inevitable , then it may be realized during a gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a singularity can be located outside the event horizon .",
    "therefore , if it does exist , then it can cause a detectable naked singularity .    from these",
    ", a question naturally arises as follows .",
    "even though we cure the cusp singularity , there are still possibilities that a gravitational collapse induces a very higher curvature region . even though it does not diverge ,",
    "if it reaches around the planck scale , then it will cause planck - scale physical effects .",
    "is it really possible and what will be the parameters that determine such a phenomenology ? regarding this , there can be two opinions .",
    "* as long as there is a planck - scale effect , it can result a distinctive outcome to outside the black hole , while we do not have any evidences of planck - scale effects during gravitational collapses .",
    "therefore , we should avoid a model that causes a cusp singularity . *",
    "if the existence of a naked singularity is inevitable , then it implies that there appears planck - scale effects around the horizon scale",
    ". this will be useful to understand the unitarity issue of black hole dynamics .",
    "the discussion on these two opposite opinions is the motivation of this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we study a gravitational collapse of @xmath0 dark energy models that contain cusp singularities , by using numerical simulations .",

    "if there exists higher order curvature corrections from quantum gravitational effects , such effects can be triggered by gravitational collapses .",

    "if there is a horizon scale curvature singularity that prevents an in - falling observer , can we identify this as a firewall ?",
    "of course , we do not have enough evidences whether a cusp singularity should appear for every cases .",
    "however , at least , this is one of logical possibilities ; also , the properties ( causal structures ) of the cusp singularity induced by @xmath0 seem to be quite consistent with the notion of the firewall .",

    "such a cusp singularity can be cured by adding a quadratic term @xmath149 , but still there can exist a ricci scalar bump around the horizon scale .",

    "since our cosmological constant is much smaller than the planck scale , i.e. , @xmath152 , hence @xmath128 will be much smaller than the planck scale .    on the other hand",
    ", one may also discuss _ for _ this : such a cusp singularity or a ricci scalar bump can role as a modification of general relativity even around the horizon scale . here ,",
    "a cusp singularity is important ; usually a gravitational collapsing process is sub - planckian and hence its back - reaction to higher curvature corrections will be much weaker .",
    "however , if there exists a cusp singularity , then super - planckian effect can be triggered by sub - planckian gravitational collapses .",
    "can we identify this as a firewall @xcite that resolves troubles of black hole complementarity @xcite ?",
    "it is still unclear . at once there is a cusp singularity , even though it is inside the horizon , it will be useful to prevent inconsistency of black hole complementarity .",
    "in addition , the existence of a cusp singularity can be argued that it is originated from quantum corrections of gravity .",
    "however , the existence of a cusp singularity requires an exotic shape of terms , e.g. , @xmath1 , while their theoretical stability is not clear .",
    "at least , we open this as a logical possibility .",
