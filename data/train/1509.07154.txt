    "the investigation of heavy - quark ( bottom or charm ) production in @xmath2 collisions is a useful test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) since the heavy quark mass provides a hard scale that allows to perform calculations within perturbation theory . at leading order ( lo ) , boson - gluon fusion , @xmath3 is the dominant process for bottom - quark production .",
    "when the negative squared four - momentum of the initial and final electron , @xmath4 , is small , the process @xmath5 is treated as photoproduction , in which a quasi - real photon emitted by the initial electron interacts with the partons in the proton ( direct contribution ) . for @xmath6 , in addition to the direct contributions , there are also resolved contributions , where the incoming photon changes into an initial quark or gluon , which interact with partons from the incoming proton .    bottom photoproduction has been measured using several different methods by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera . in most of the measurements ,",
    "the cross section was obtained using semi - leptonic decays into muons or electrons .",
    "all these measurements have been compared with predictions based on the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the bottom quark is generated in the hard scattering - process and appears only in the final state .",
    "predictions for the photoproduction cross section are calculated at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) taking the finite mass of the bottom quark explicitly into account .",
    "reasonable agreement of the data with ffns predictions has been obtained .    in the large-@xmath7 region ,",
    "characterized by @xmath8 , the so - called massless or zero - mass variable flavor - number - scheme ( zm - vfns ) @xcite is considered more appropriate .",
    "this is the conventional parton model approach , where the @xmath0 quark , considered massless like any other incoming parton , is also an incoming parton from the proton and , for the resolved contribution , from the incoming photon .",
    "this gives rise to additional contributions from hard - scattering subprocesses with @xmath0 quarks in the initial state , besides those with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks and the gluon ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "predictions in this approach are reliable only in the large @xmath7-region where terms of the order @xmath14 are negligible .",
    "calculations at nlo automatically resum leading and next - to - leading logarithmic terms @xmath15 . at the same time , all non - logarithmic terms through @xmath16 are retained for @xmath17 . with the usual choice of renormalization ( @xmath18 ) and factorization scales ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 for initial and final - state factorization , resp . ) , @xmath21 , the results are dominated by contributions from the @xmath0-quark pdf of the proton down to @xmath22 .    the neglect of the terms of order @xmath14 in the hard scattering cross section is remedied in the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite .",
    "this theoretical framework combines the ffn and the zm - vfn schemes .",
    "the mass - dependent terms of the ffns are added to the zm - vfns by applying subtractions in such a way that in the limit @xmath23 the hard - scattering cross sections in the zm - vfns are recovered . however , with the conventional choice of scales indicated above , the results in the gm - vfns are still dominated by the contributions of the @xmath0-quark pdf down to @xmath24 . therefore , there is no smooth transition from the gm - vfns at large @xmath7 values to the ffns in the small-@xmath7 range , and the gm - vfns in its original definition fails to describe the small-@xmath7 cross sections .",
    "the dominance of contributions with @xmath0-quarks in the initial state at small @xmath7-values is connected to the fact that this part is treated in the massless scheme .",
    "a calculation of the @xmath0-quark initiated subprocesses in a scheme with massive partons is not available for photo- and for hadroproduction .",
    "in addition it would be necessary to correctly describe the effects of the finite bottom - quark mass @xmath25 in the dglap evolution .",
    "attempts in this direction have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the cross section with massless partons is divergent for @xmath26 . for a realistic description",
    "it is therefore necessary to eliminate the contribution with massless @xmath0-quarks in the initial state in the small-@xmath7 region .",
    "for inclusive @xmath27-meson production in @xmath28 collisions this has been achieved in recent work together with kniehl and schienbein @xcite by a suitable choice of scales @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this",
    "modified gm - vfns the ffns results with the exact @xmath25 dependence are recovered at small @xmath7 .",
    "this way reasonable results were obtained for the inclusive @xmath27-meson production cross section measured with cdf at the fermilab tevatron and with lhcb at the cern lhc .",
    "it is the aim of this work to apply the same prescription for the choice of the factorization scales to @xmath0-quark photoproduction . for the resolved part",
    "the modified prescription works as described in @xcite for hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "for the direct part a corresponding calculation has not been done yet .",
    "we shall do this here and compare our results to recent zeus and h1 cross section data in order to study whether the modifications of the gm - vfns can lead to a better agreement with presently available experimental data .",
    "cross sections for inclusive charmed - hadron photoproduction have been calculated in the past @xcite , but without the scale modifications described in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding experimental data are not available for very small @xmath7 , where the modifications would be most clearly visible . for somewhat larger @xmath7 ,",
    "very good agreement of the various observables for inclusive @xmath29 photoproduction has been found @xcite .",

    "this behavior is caused by the scale choice with @xmath61 .",
    "the curve for the lower error estimate with @xmath62 , however , shows a turn - over towards small @xmath7 with a maximum at @xmath63 gev .",
    "this is the same characteristic behavior as in the ffns @xcite and is caused in our case by the fact that at around @xmath64 gev the factorization scales @xmath65 fall below @xmath25 where the @xmath0-quark pdf and ff are zero .",
    "the same typical turn - over was also found in our previous study of inclusive @xmath27-meson production for @xmath66 and @xmath67 collisions @xcite .",
    "actually , the @xmath0-quark cross section is calculated from the @xmath27-meson cross section using an evolved fragmentation function ( ff ) for @xmath68 taken from @xcite and dividing by the branching fraction @xmath69 .",
    "the effect of the evolved ff is visible at larger values of @xmath70 gev where the cross section @xmath31 is smaller than without a ff .",
    "we emphasize that a consistent theoretical prescription of the gm - vfns requires to include a ff describing the @xmath71 transition since final state singularities have to be subtracted from the bare cross section in analogy to the calculation in the zm - vfns .",
    "unfortunately all the zeus measurements are for @xmath72 gev , so that any turn - over of the cross section @xmath31 towards @xmath22 is not measured . all data points agree reasonably well also with the gm - vfns predictions with the original default scale @xmath73 .",
    "a monotonic increase of the cross section @xmath31 for the production of a massive quark towards small @xmath7 is unphysical . from our previous work on @xmath27-meson production in @xmath66 and @xmath67 collisions @xcite we know how the choice of the factorization scales must be modified in order to obtain cross sections for @xmath60 which show the expected behavior .",
    "therefore , as in @xcite , we choose as the new default scales @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that both the @xmath0-quark pdf and the ff for the @xmath71 transition vanish for @xmath76 already at non - zero @xmath7 . with @xmath77 , @xmath78 as the new default scale choice",
    ", we estimate the theoretical error in the usual way by varying the renormalization scale parameter @xmath18 by a factor 2 up and down about the default scale .",
    "we have not introduced an extra prescription to freeze @xmath18 below @xmath25 because the choice of @xmath18 is not related to switching off @xmath0-quark initiated subprocesses .",

    "although the @xmath7-dependence of the differential cross section @xmath31 exhibits the expected turn - over at @xmath91 gev if the new default scales are chosen , the predicted cross section is still larger than the experimental data , even when taking into account the experimental uncertainty .",
