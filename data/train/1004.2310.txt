    "the concept of @xmath2-clustering is essential to understand the structure of light nuclei  @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath1o is one of the nuclei which have the most extensively been studied with the cluster model as well as with the shell model . while the ground state is well understood to have a doubly - closed - shell structure , the excited state , such as the second @xmath3 state , is known as one of `` the mysterious @xmath3 states '' whose excitation energy , @xmath12 mev , is too low to be explained in terms of the shell model  @xcite .",
    "it had also been mysterious that the second @xmath3 state forms a rotational band with low - lying @xmath13 and @xmath14 states . besides those states",
    ", the third @xmath3 state at @xmath15 mev has been difficult to be understood from the shell model aspect as well .",
    "one of the main aims of the cluster model approach has been to describe these states from a different perspective and , indeed , the studies based on the @xmath2-cluster model have succeeded in reproducing many experimental data .",
    "it was clarified that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states have @xmath18c@xmath19 and @xmath20c@xmath21 cluster structures , where the @xmath2 particle rotates in an @xmath22 and @xmath23 wave around the @xmath24c core being in @xmath3 and @xmath13 states , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the great success also comes from having further revealed that almost all of the excited states up to @xmath25 mev have considerable large @xmath26c cluster components  @xcite .    besides @xmath26c clustering , @xmath0 clustering",
    "can also be expected to exist around the decay threshold into @xmath0 particles at @xmath27 mev , as suggested by ikeda _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . as an intriguing subject investigating the @xmath0 cluster structure",
    ", the presence of a @xmath0 linear - chain state still remains an open question  @xcite .",
    "another possibility are dilute gas - like states composed of weakly interacting @xmath0 particles  @xcite .",
    "they are analogues to the hoyle state , i.e. the @xmath16 state in @xmath24c , well described by a gas - like @xmath28-particle structure with dilute density  @xcite . in good approximation it forms a product state of the @xmath28 particles in the lowest @xmath7 orbit of the corresponding mean field potential  @xcite .",
    "a striking fact is that the hoyle state wave function obtained more than 30 years ago by solving the @xmath28 rgm ( resonating group method ) equation of motion  @xcite is to very good approximation identical to an antisymmetrized product type wave function  @xcite , the so - called thsr ( tohsaki , horiuchi , schuck and rpke ) wave function , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and slightly modification in ref .",
    "thus , the state has been proposed to be related to boson condensation of @xmath2 particles in infinite nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the new interpretation of the hoyle state as an @xmath2 condensate has provoked many theoretical and experimental works on @xmath2-particle condensation phenomena in light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that also for @xmath29 nuclei such as @xmath30b and @xmath31c several authors try to find states which are analogous to the hoyle state  @xcite .",
    "the first investigation of the @xmath0-particle condensate state was performed via the thsr ansatz in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two excited @xmath3 states were obtained . in particular , the third @xmath3 ( @xmath32 ) state has an excitation energy close to the @xmath0 threshold and a considerably larger r.m.s .",
    "radius , @xmath33 fm , than the one of the ground state , @xmath34 fm , and therefore the @xmath32 state was regarded as a candidate of the @xmath0 condensate state .",
    "based on this theoretical prediction , an experimental search for the @xmath0 condensate state was undertaken via inelastic @xmath2 scattering on @xmath1o .",
    "a new @xmath3 state was observed , as the fourth @xmath3 state , at @xmath35 mev with a relatively large @xmath2 decay width of @xmath36 mev  @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of the cross section of the inelastic @xmath2 scattering to the new state well agrees with the calculated one using the @xmath32 wave function .",
    "the relatively large decay width of @xmath36 mev is also consistently reproduced by the thsr wave function  @xcite .",
    "these results lead to the conclusion  @xcite that the @xmath32 state may be assigned to the new @xmath3 state at @xmath35 mev .",
    "thus the @xmath35 mev state was considered to be a candidate of the @xmath0 condensate state  @xcite .",
    "in order to confirm the above mentioned thsr description of @xmath1o , recently the present authors investigated the @xmath0 condensate state via the @xmath0 ocm ( orthogonality condition model )  @xcite .",
    "the four - body ( @xmath0 ) problem with respect to the @xmath2-@xmath2 relative motion was solved in a model space large enough to describe the dilute @xmath0 gas - like configuration , as well as @xmath26c cluster and shell - model - like ground state structures , using the gaussian expansion method  @xcite .",
    "a one - to - one correspondence with the observed energy spectrum up to the @xmath10 state ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) was observed .",
    "it further was shown that the calculated @xmath10 ( @xmath37 ) state has large occupation probability of @xmath38 % for @xmath0 s in the single @xmath7 orbit and also a large overlap with the @xmath39c@xmath40(hoyle state ) structure .",
    "these results indicate that the @xmath37 state can be regarded to be the @xmath0 condensate state as the analogue to the hoyle state , to be identified with the sixth experimental @xmath3 state at @xmath11 mev .",
    "the well - known @xmath2-cluster structures of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states were simultaneously reproduced , in agreement with previous ocm calculations  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 states both have @xmath39c cluster structures , where the @xmath2 cluster orbits in a higher nodal @xmath22-wave and in a @xmath43-wave around the @xmath24c core with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "these states had not been discussed so far in the literature .    in this work , we confront our previous analysis with the thsr wave function for @xmath1o [ 11 ] with the above mentioned results from the ocm approach . as we explained above ,",
    "the @xmath0 ocm results tell us that the @xmath10 state at @xmath11 mev is a good candidate for the @xmath0 condensate state . in ref .",
    "@xcite using the thsr wave function only three @xmath3 states were obtained , including the ground state .",
    "this scarcity of @xmath3 states in the thsr approach is easily understood by the fact that it allows only for two limiting configurations , that is a pure slater determinant for @xmath46 and a pure @xmath2-particle gas for @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "asymptotic configurations like @xmath48 are absent . they may be represented in a rough average way by the intermediate @xmath3 state . in any case",
    "the situation is such that it incited us to reanalyze the previous study of ref .",
    "the important question is whether or not the counterpart of the @xmath37 state can also be found with the thsr ansatz , which should be a further state located above the @xmath32 state . in this respect , we need to recall that , in the previous thsr calculation  @xcite , a proper resonance boundary condition was not imposed even for the states above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "thus we could not obtain reliable results for higher @xmath3 states than the @xmath32 state .",
    "the other excited state then only mocks up in an average way the states which have dominant @xmath26c structure .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report on results of a @xmath0 thsr calculation with proper treatment of the resonances .",
    "we will see that this calculation gives us a new @xmath3 state as the @xmath6 state , slightly above the @xmath0 threshold . by comparing the wave functions of the @xmath6 state and the @xmath37 state in the @xmath0 ocm calculation",
    ", it will be clarified that both states well correspond to each other .",
    "in particular , we will show that the @xmath6 state has a larger r.m.s .",
    "radius , a larger amount of condensate fraction , and a more sharpened peak around zero momentum for the @xmath2-particle momentum distribution , than the @xmath32 state .",
    "those properties are comparable to those of the @xmath37 state .",
    "this indicates that the newly found @xmath6 state should be considered as the @xmath0 condensate state and is likely to be assigned to the @xmath10 state observed at @xmath11 mev .",

    "the calculation of the resonance state in the bound state approximation is usually done by diagonalizing the hamiltonian with the use of a finite number of square - integrable basis wave functions .",
    "the calculated positive energy eigenstates which are linear combinations of the basis wave functions are divided into resonance states and continuum states .",
    "there are many practical methods to carry out this division .",

    "let us first consider an attractive pseudo - potential @xmath79 which is added to the original hamiltonian @xmath80 , yielding @xmath81 where @xmath8 is a coupling constant used to vary the strength of the pseudo - potential .",

    "this behavior of the eigenenergies as functions of @xmath8 is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . in this figure",
    ", the curve labeled ( b ) around @xmath83 represents the eigenenergy of the resonance state denoted as @xmath84 .",
    "it decreases as @xmath8 increases .",
    "this curve ( b ) then crosses the curve ( a ) , which is flat around @xmath83 and is the eigenenergy of a continuum state denoted as @xmath85 .",
    "after the closest approach of the two curves ( b ) and ( a ) , the curve labeled ( b ) , which is the smooth continuation of the curve ( a ) , and hence is disconnected from the curve ( b ) , represents the eigenenergy of the resonance state @xmath84 .",
    "this reminds us of the landau - zener level crossing scenario , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the eigenenergy of the continuum state @xmath85 , which is first represented by the curve ( a ) , continues with an almost flat shape , except near the crossing points .",
    "eventually it is converted into the curve ( a ) . in the case of the resonance state @xmath84 at @xmath83 , we can consider that this state contains a negligible amount of admixture of continuum state components , since it is located far from the crossing points with the continuum states .",
    "however , in the case of the resonance state @xmath86 corresponding to the resonance state curve ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , the state is at @xmath83 already involved in the crossing with the continuum state curve ( c ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 at @xmath83 should contain a sizable admixture of the continuum state .",
    "this is the usual situation for a resonance state with a broad width , and the resonance wave function obtained by using the bound state approximation can not be trusted , because of the sizable admixture of the continuum state .    in order to overcome this difficulty , we note the utility of the continuum state wave functions obtained using the bound state approximation in the neighborhood of the resonance state , since they should contain sizable admixtures of the resonance state component . in our present simple example considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , we notice the utility of the continuum state wave function @xmath87",

    "@xcite is obtained by noticing that the extension of the density of a resonance state is far smaller than the one of continuum states .",
    "more precisely , we can determine @xmath2 and @xmath91 from the requirement that the quantity @xmath92 be a minimum , where @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the mass number .",
    "this requirement is satisfied by diagonalizing the operator @xmath95 in the basis states @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and by choosing @xmath96 to be the eigenvector belonging to the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "when the resonance component is distributed among several energy eigenstates , we need to diagonalize the operator @xmath95 in these energy eigenstates . when the energy eigenstates contain two resonance components , the diagonalization of the operator @xmath95 gives two small eigenvalues .",
    "two resonance states are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath82 with the two wave functions which give the two smallest eigenvalues of the operator @xmath95 .",
    "we are now able to calculate approximate values of resonance energies along the resonance energy curve .",
    "if a point on the resonance state curve is not influenced by any crossing points with continuum state curves , we can regard the energy of the point to be just the resonance energy . on the other hand ,",
    "if a point on the resonance state curve is influenced by some near - by crossing point , we extract the resonance wave function using the procedure explained above and then calculate the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath82 with the extracted wave function , which is just the resonance energy at this point .",

    "[ subsec : rmsmin ] enables us to extract the fourth state , which must exist in our approach around @xmath121 mev above the @xmath0 threshold .",

    "[ subsec : overlap ] , where the latter wave function is constructed with the orthogonalization to the lower excited states and the ground state .",
    "that is , we can think that the orthogonalization reduces the occupation probability into a single @xmath22 orbit to the value of @xmath262 % , from about @xmath296 % .",
    "in other words , we can say that the reduction is caused by the effect of the antisymmetrization , which remains in the orthogonalization operator @xmath299 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:39 ] ) .      in the previous sections",
    ", we clarified that the @xmath6 state apparently has a @xmath0 condensate structure , and is likely to be the counterpart of the @xmath37 state with the @xmath0 condensate structure obtained in the @xmath0 ocm calculation .",
    "we therefore consider that the @xmath6 state probably corresponds to the observed @xmath10 state at @xmath11 mev , as does the @xmath37 state .",
    "in this situation , we should keep in mind that the thsr wave function is not adapted to treat @xmath276c configurations , since all @xmath2 s are treated on equal footing .",
    "therefore , the @xmath138 and @xmath32 states obtained from the thsr wave function mock up in an incomplete way the @xmath39c configurations in @xmath1o",
    ". it will be important in future work to include those configurations into the thsr description .",
    "on the other hand , the position of the @xmath32 state is rather close to the @xmath0 threshold , and we see that the state also has a large amount of @xmath2 condensate fraction , though the amount is not so large as that of the @xmath6 state . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath32 state could also be a candidate for the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the result of the @xmath0 ocm calculation indicates that a sizable fraction of the @xmath0 condensation is only included in the @xmath37 state and not in the other five @xmath3 states .",
    "the explanation may again reside in the fact that we treat with thsr ansatz all @xmath2 particles equally and then a relatively large r.m.s .",
    "radius value necessarily also leads to an @xmath2-gas - like state whereas in reality a large size also can be obtained from an @xmath26c configuration .",
    "this points to the necessity to include @xmath26c configurations into the thsr wave function .",
    "let us mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite the magnitude of the angular distribution of cross section in the @xmath300 inelastic scattering to the observed @xmath41 state agrees very well with that calculated for the @xmath32 state , in spite of our present conclusion that the @xmath17 state is not very similar to the @xmath6 state .",
    "this agreement , nevertheless , seems rather natural , since as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the magnitude of the angular distribution in the inelastic scattering depends most sensitively on the size of the excited state and not so much on its internal structure .",
    "in this work , we reanalyzed the thsr wave function for the @xmath0 system introduced previously by the last four authors of the present paper .    searching for states in the continuum we found an additional @xmath3 state .",
    "this @xmath6 state was obtained at 3 mev above the @xmath0 threshold and was shown to have a large r.m.s .",
    "radius of 6.1 fm .",
    "this finding could be done with the help of the proper treatment of resonances based on the accc method , which was developed by some of the present authors .",
    "we compared the wave function of the @xmath6 state with the one of the @xmath37 state , which was previously obtained with the @xmath0 ocm calculation as the @xmath0 condensate state .",
    "it was clarified that we could reasonably understand that the @xmath6 state corresponds to the @xmath37 state , and then is the most appropriate for the @xmath0 condensate state , rather than the @xmath32 state which had been considered to correspond to the condensate state in @xcite .    in the analyses of the thsr wave function",
    ", we showed that the @xmath6 state contains a large component of @xmath26c@xmath157 clustering in a way which is similar to the @xmath37 state .",
    "this indicates that both states correspond to each other and have a gas - like configuration of the @xmath0 particles as the analogue to the hoyle state , from the fact that the hoyle state has a @xmath28-gas - like configuration as the @xmath28 condensate state .",
    "the @xmath6 state is then described by a single thsr wave function with a large value of the @xmath62 parameter in a space orthogonal to the other three @xmath137@xmath32 states , though the @xmath137@xmath6 states are in general expressed as the form of superposition of many thsr wave functions with respect to values of the @xmath62 parameter . in order to further discuss quantitatively the amount of @xmath2 condensate fraction , we extracted the boson degrees of freedom from the thsr wave function , which is microscopically described based on the nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "it was done via somewhat approximate procedures which should be valid at low densities .",
    "we showed that the occupation probability for the @xmath6 state concentrates by a large amount on a single-@xmath2 @xmath7 orbit , like the @xmath37 state .",
    "the shape of the orbits for both states is similar to each other and characteristic for hoyle - like states .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath6 state is shown to have a strong peak around zero momentum in the @xmath2-particle momentum distribution , indicating that the @xmath2 particles are condensed around zero momentum .",
    "we also discussed the reason why the @xmath32 state , as well as the @xmath138 state , can not be regarded as corresponding to the @xmath0 condensate state , in spite of the fact that the states possess somewhat enhanced condensate - like features .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that the @xmath6 state corresponds to the @xmath37 state and is the most appropriately considered to be the @xmath0 condensate state .",
    "this further gives us a strong support that the @xmath0 condensate state exists around the @xmath0 breakup threshold and is very likely the observed @xmath10 state at @xmath11 mev .",
    "this conclusion will be supplemented with more extended calculation than the present thsr description so as to incorporate @xmath301 clustering configurations . as concluded from comparison with ocm calculations",
    ", the @xmath301 components may then have a substantial contribution so that the condensate fractions will be reduced .",
    "it is nevertheless expected that the @xmath6 state remains an excellent approximation also in such an extended thsr description .",
