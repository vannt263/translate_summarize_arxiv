    "several field - theoretic models predict existence of stationary finite energy excitations called q - balls , see @xcite for a review .",
    "such objects arise as a highly nontrivial consequence of collective nonlinear dynamics of the fields . in contradistinction to topological defects which appear because of a frustration of the field interpolating between different degenerate vacua , the q - balls exist in models with non degenerate vacuum .",
    "they must be taken into account in every thorough analysis of the dynamics of the fields .    in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that the q - balls can be found also in the complex signum - gordon model .",
    "they differ from other q - balls by their strictly finite size : the vacuum field @xmath6 outside a spherically symmetric q - ball is reached at a finite radius @xmath7 , and it is approached in a parabolic manner .",
    "such parabolic behavior is the general feature of field theoretic models with v - shaped self interaction terms @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the field theoretic force density , which in the case of the complex signum - gordon model with the complex scalar field @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the self coupling constant , does not vanish in the limit @xmath12 . therefore , for weak fields it is always stronger than the gradient force ( @xmath13 ) which alone would lead to an infinitely long tail in the spatial asymptotics of the field , and also stronger that the mass term ( @xmath14 ) which together with the gradient force would lead to the well - known exponential asymptotics for the field .",
    "heuristically , one can say that the parabolic behavior is due to the fact that the field resists with a finite force density even the slightest deviations from the vacuum configuration .",
    "the self interaction term @xmath15 is v - shaped because its plot has the form of the inverted symmetric cone with the vacuum field @xmath16 right at the tip .",
    "the models with v - shaped potentials are interesting for several reasons @xcite .",
    "let us mention here a scaling symmetry of the on - shell type , and the lack of a free field regime because the field equations can not be linearized around the vacuum solution . in case of smooth self interactions the second derivative of pertinent field potential at @xmath17",
    "gives a mass scale which is physically important in the vacuum sector .",
    "defined in this manner mass scale is infinite if the potential is v - shaped .",
    "the motivation for the present paper comes from the idea that the finite vacuum restoring force can perhaps win over the electrostatic repulsion for arbitrarily large electrically charged q - balls . in order to address this question",
    "we extend the complex signum - gordon model by including an abelian gauge field @xmath18 minimally coupled to the scalar field .",
    "thus , the global @xmath19 symmetry is replaced by the local one .",
    "the considered model is a version of scalar electrodynamics .",
    "it has turned out that in such scalar electrodynamics there exist electrically charged q - balls provided that the absolute value of the total electric charge @xmath1 is small enough . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "we find , rather surprisingly , q - shells with completely empty interior .",
    "ther is no upper bound on @xmath2 .",
    "both q - balls and q - shells are static , spherically symmetric , and the charge density exactly vanishes outside certain finite , @xmath1-dependent radius @xmath7 .",
    "the scalar field approaches its vacuum value @xmath16 in the parabolic manner , while the electric field of course has the standard coulomb tail .",
    "the total energy is finite .",
    "another very interesting finding is a zigzag in the plot of the total energy versus the total electric charge @xmath1 at intermediate values of @xmath1 , where the q - balls transform into the q - shells .    in literature",
    "one can find several other versions of scalar electrodynamics with q - balls , see @xcite . in all of them",
    "there exists a maximal value of the total electric charge the static q - balls can have .",
    "q - shells were not found . in our case",
    "the electric charge can be arbitrarily large , but there is the transition from q - balls to q - shells at certain intermediate value of the charge .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model and discuss field equations for the spherical solitons .",
    "the q - ball solutions for small values of @xmath2 are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the q - shell solutions in the case of large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the transition from q - balls to q - shells at the intermediate values of @xmath2 is studied in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains a summary and remarks .",
    "the lagrangian of our model has the following form @xmath20 where @xmath8 is the complex scalar field in @xmath21-dimensional minkowski space - time , @xmath22 is the self coupling constant , @xmath23 is the modulus of @xmath8 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath18 is the @xmath19 gauge field . for the sake of convenience the fields @xmath26 , the space - time coordinates @xmath27 and the constants @xmath28 are dimensionless .",
    "of course , in physical applications they should be multiplied by certain dimensional constants .",
    "euler - lagrange equations give the maxwell equations @xmath29 with the current density @xmath30 and the scalar field equation @xmath31 by definition , the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is equal to 0 when @xmath17 ( see section ii in @xcite ) .",
    "the field potential @xmath15 can be regarded as the limit of the smooth potential @xmath32 when @xmath33 .",
    "we will consider the simplest static , spherically symmetric q - balls with vanishing magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding ansatz has the form @xmath34 here @xmath35 is a real function of the radial coordinate @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a constant real frequency .",
    "the spatial part of the maxwell equations is trivially satisfied , while the gauss law has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the three dimensional laplacian .",
    "the scalar field equation is reduced to @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "equations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) acquire a simpler form when we change a little bit the notation . with @xmath42",
    "we obtain the following equations @xmath43 note that the fields @xmath44 are gauge - invariant as opposed to @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( the ansatz ( 5 ) fixes the gauge only partially because the @xmath19 gauge transformations which depend only on time are still allowed ) .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath47 can be removed with the help of rescaling @xmath48 and therefore we may put @xmath49 without any loss of generality . after taking into account the spherical symmetry",
    "we finally obtain the following equations @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the derivative @xmath53 .",
    "these equations are supplemented by two conditions .",
    "first , continuity of @xmath54 at @xmath55 implies the conditions @xmath56 second , because eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) together with the condition ( 10 ) are invariant under the transformations @xmath57 we may also assume that @xmath58 we shall see that in fact @xmath59 .    the total electric charge @xmath1 and the total energy @xmath3 are given by the following formulas @xmath60 @xmath61.\\ ] ] as already signalled , we put @xmath49 .",
    "the q - balls and q - shells are represented by solutions of eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) which obey the conditions ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and have finite @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "let us have a look at eq .",
    ". it can be written in the integral form @xmath62 which implies that the function @xmath63 can not decrease when @xmath36 increases because @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , we shall shortly see that in the case of q - balls and q - shells @xmath65 vanishes for all @xmath66 , where @xmath7 is the finite radius of the cloud of the electric charge",
    ". therefore , @xmath67 for @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and in consequence , @xmath70 for large @xmath36 .",
    "the usual condition that the electrostatic potential @xmath71 vanishes at the spatial infinity and the definition of the function @xmath72 imply that @xmath73 .",
    "hence , for @xmath74 @xmath75 it follows that @xmath76 for large @xmath36 , as expected for the static spherically symmetric , spatially localized electric charge distribution . is negative while @xmath77 .",
    "we call @xmath78 the charge and @xmath1 the total electric charge . ]",
    "it is the well - known fact that q - ball solutions in models with a global @xmath19 symmetry minimize the total energy @xmath3 under the condition that the u(1 ) global charge is kept constant @xcite .",
    "also in the considered case of local @xmath19 gauge symmetry our q - balls and q - shells minimize the total energy , but one has to assume not only that the total electric charge @xmath1 is constant but also that the gauss law ( 8) holds .",
    "this latter condition follows from the fact that the gauss law is in fact a constraint which is essential for the physical content of the electrodynamics . therefore the variations @xmath79",
    ", @xmath80 have to be interrelated in such a manner that the fields @xmath81 , @xmath82 also obey that constraint .",
    "it follows that in the linear approximation the admissible spherically symmetric variations obey the condition @xmath83 using this constraint one can show that @xmath84\\ ; \\delta g.\\ ] ] it is clear that the conditions @xmath85 imply eq .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the second variation of the energy is positive because it can be written in the form @xmath86\\ ] ] ( here we use the regularized version @xmath87 of the field potential ) .",
    "thus , the q - ball and q - shell solutions indeed give local minima of the energy .",
    "qualitative analysis of solutions of the set of eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) can be accomplished with the help of the standard tool : a mechanical analogy . in the context of q - balls",
    "such interpretation of field equations was used already in @xcite .",
    "thus , we regard ( 8) , ( 9 ) as newton s equations of motion for a fictitious particle of unit mass moving in the @xmath88-plane . because of the assumptions ( 11 ) we actually consider motions in the first quarter of the plane .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath36 plays the role of time .",
    "there are two forces acting on the particle : the friction force given by the two - vector @xmath89 and the external force @xmath90 .",
    "the external force does not have a potential , i.e. , @xmath91 with certain @xmath92 .",
    "this fact reflects the different origins of eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) : eq .",
    "( 8) is in fact the gauss law for the electric field , hence it is a constraint , while eq .",
    "( 9 ) comes from the dynamical evolution equation for the scalar field .",
    "the @xmath72 component of @xmath93 ( equal to @xmath94 ) is nonnegative .",
    "this means that the particle is constantly pushed in the @xmath72 direction until @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath96 component of @xmath93 vanishes along the hyperbola @xmath97 and along the straight line @xmath95 .",
    "it is negative above that hyperbola ( a ` northern slope ' ) and positive when @xmath98 ( a ` southern slope ' ) .",
    "one may imagine that the particle moves in a curved valley with the bottom on the hyperbola , and that there is a ` @xmath72-wind ' which constantly pushes the particle in the positive @xmath72 direction .",
    "the mechanical analogy presented above might seem relatively complicated , nevertheless it gives the right intuitions about the existence and the form of solutions of eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) .",
    "for example , one can guess that perhaps the ` b - wind ' can just push the particle along the bottom of the valley .",
    "this would mean that there exists a solution such that @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , it turns out that this is the case : the solution has the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "unfortunately , this solution is not interesting as far as the q - balls are concerned because it is singular at @xmath55 and it has the infinite total energy and charge .",
    "note that there are no q - balls such that @xmath102 . in this case",
    "( 8) and the condition @xmath103 imply that @xmath104 for all @xmath105 , i.e. , that the particle moves along the @xmath96-axis . then , it follows from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that @xmath106 .",
    "the electric charge density for this solution vanishes , but the total energy is infinite .",
    "the q - ball solution corresponds to the trajectory of the particle which starts at the ` time ' @xmath55 with the vanishing initial velocity @xmath107 from a point @xmath108 lying on the ` northern slope ' , and reaches the @xmath72-axis at a finite ` time ' @xmath7 , @xmath109 . if at that ` time '",
    "also @xmath110 , then for @xmath68 the particle moves along the @xmath72-axis , asymptotically approaching the point @xmath111 , as it follows from formula ( 15 ) .",
    "it is stopped by the friction force , while the external force @xmath93 vanishes on the @xmath72-axis .",
    "the condition @xmath110 means that the particle lands on the @xmath72-axis tangentially to it .",
    "this is possible because of the ` @xmath72-wind ' .",
    "the trajectories of the type described above correspond to the simplest q - balls .",

    "the particle moves along the b - axis .",
    "it slows down and approaches the point @xmath247 in the coulomb way given by formula ( 15 ) . on the q - shell side ,",
    "the solutions have the shape presented in fig .",
    "4 . note the influence of the ` b - wind ' : @xmath248 is significantly larger than @xmath249 .",
    "our main findings are presented in fig .",
    "6 , where @xmath144 and @xmath78 are plotted as the functions of the radius @xmath7 ( in the case of q - shells it is the outer radius ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath7 is a convenient independent variable because it monotonically grows when we change the initial data along the thick dotted line in fig .",
    "2 starting from the small q - balls end ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "rather surprisingly , close to @xmath251 the total energy and the charge of the large q - balls decrease when @xmath7 increases . the same is true for the small q - shells with the outer radius slightly above @xmath251 .",
    "thus , the functions @xmath252 have one local maximum and one local minimum . as far as we can see from our numerical data the maxima occur at the same values of @xmath7 .",
    "the same seems to be true for the minima .",
    "note that the variations of @xmath253 in this region of @xmath7 are rather small .",
    "we know that @xmath254 for small q - balls ( i.e. , when @xmath255 ) , and that @xmath256 for large q - shells ( @xmath257 ) . using the numerical results summarized in fig .",
    "6 we have constructed the plot of @xmath144 versus @xmath78 for @xmath78 in the interval [ 9.73 , 9.78 ] . it has the zigzag shape schematically shown in fig .",
    "the two spikes correspond to the maxima and minima of @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "the presence of spikes in the plot of energy versus charge was found in other models with q - balls long time ago , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "( the thick dots ) and of the total charge @xmath78 ( the triangles ) versus the radius @xmath7 in the transition region . in the case of q - shells",
    "@xmath7 is the outer radius.,width=491,height=302 ]    we expect that the spikes are infinitely narrow . our argument is based on the formula @xmath260 if the maxima of @xmath253 are located at @xmath261 , respectively , then close to them @xmath262,\\ ] ] @xmath263,\\ ] ] where @xmath264 are different from zero ( and < 0 ) . if @xmath265 the derivative @xmath266 would become infinite at the point @xmath267 .",
    "the numerical results do not show any such increase of @xmath266 , hence @xmath268 .    .",
    "the arrows point in the direction of growing @xmath7 .",
    "the dot on the uppermost line corresponds to the solution which separates the q - balls from the q - shells ( @xmath269 , @xmath170 ) .",
    "the upper spike corresponds to the maxima of @xmath144 and @xmath78 , the lower one to the minima .",
    ", width=453,height=340 ]    in consequence , @xmath266 is a continuous function of @xmath7 at @xmath270 .",
    "this means that the direction tangent to the curve @xmath271 changes infinitesimally when we infinitesimally cross the maximum .",
    "completely analogous reasoning applies to the lower spike in fig .",
    "7 which corresponds to the minima of @xmath253 .",
    "\\1 . let us summarize our results .",
    "we have shown with the help of the mechanical analogy and of the numerical calculations that in the @xmath19 gauged signum - gordon model there exist compact , electrically charged non topological solitons .",
    "they have the form of the q - balls if the modulus of the total electric charge is smaller than @xmath272 , where @xmath243 and @xmath25 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "when @xmath273 we have found the q - shells which are completely empty inside : the energy and the electric charge densities exactly vanish in a finite ball around the center of the soliton .",
    "while electrically charged q - balls have been found also in other models @xcite , the static q - shells appear only in the gauged signum - gordon model .",
    "our feeling is that this is connected with the fact that the scalar field of the signum - gordon model reaches its vacuum value @xmath16 on a finite distance ( in the parabolic manner ) , not only in the direction of the infinity but also in the direction of the origin .",
    "of course , also the electrostatic repulsion is an important ingredient ",
    "it prevents the q - shell form a collapse .",
    "furthermore , we have found the approximate analytic solutions of the field equations which agree very well with the numerical results in the limits of very small and very large absolute values of the electric charge .",
    "this is especially important in the latter case because the purely numerical approach is not sufficient in order to convincigly tackle the limit @xmath274 .",
    "it is interesting to see in detail the change of the exponent from @xmath275 to @xmath276 in the dependence of the energy @xmath144 on the charge @xmath78 when passing from the asymptotic regions of very small to very large charges .",
    "note that the figure 7 reminds a first order phase transition in , e.g. , van der waals gas , @xcite .",
    "we have not found a good analytic approximation for solutions in the intermediate region .",
    "the formula given at the end of section 2 shows that the second variation of the energy @xmath277 is positive .",
    "therefore the q - balls and the q - shells are stable against small radial perturbations . in general however the question of their stability is rather complex one if one considers also nonsymmetric perturbations .",
    "first , they can perhaps decay by emitting small q - balls and/or a scalar and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we have checked on our numerical solutions that a split into two objects of the charge @xmath278 is energetically forbidden only for small q - balls ( @xmath78 < 1.62 ... ) .",
    "this of course does not prove that such a decay of large q - balls in a finite time is dynamically possible .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the perturbed solitons can be very nontrivial because of complicated electromagnetic interactions of currents and charges .",
    "note also that the usual criterion for the global stability consisting in excluding the possibility of evaporation by emission of quanta of the scalar field @xcite is hard to apply in our case because the signum - gordon model can not be linearized if the scalar field is close to the vacuum field .",
    "therefore , an estimate of the rest mass of the quanta is not available  it is a rather difficult problem which belongs to non perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "we have investigated only the simplest ( elementary ) q - balls and q - shells .",
    "the mechanical interpretation of eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) suggests that there also exist solutions such that the charge density has several maxima . in this case",
    "the classical particle travels along the valley for a longer time climbing the ` southern slope ' more than once until it finally settles on the b - axis . also numerical investigations have shown solutions of this type .",
    "the relation @xmath271 for such complex q - balls and q - shells is not known as yet .",
    "another open problem is their stability against a decay into the elementary q - balls and q - shells .",
