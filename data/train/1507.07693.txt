    "the genetic information carried by the mrna and then translated into proteins is encoded into nucleotide triplets called _ codons_. four alternate nucleotidic bases ( a , u , c , g ) compose the mrna , so that there are @xmath4 possible codons that have to code for only @xmath5 naturally occurring amino acids .",
    "the genetic code is therefore redundant : while a few amino acids correspond to a single codon , most amino acids can be encoded by different codons .",
    "different codons coding for the same amino acid are known as synonymous codons , and in a wide variety of organisms synonymous codons are used with different frequencies  a phenomenon known as _",
    "codon bias_. with the advent of whole - genome sequencing of numerous species , genome - wide patterns of codon bias are emerging in the different organisms .",
    "various factors such as expression level , gc content , recombination rates , rna stability , codon position , gene length , environmental stress and population size , can influence codon usage bias within and among species @xcite . while the biological meaning and origin of codon bias is not yet fully understood , there is a large consensus that the degeneration of the genetic code might provide an additional degree of freedom to modulate accuracy and efficiency of translation @xcite . indeed , population genetic studies @xcite have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection , and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between mutation - selection ( random variability in genetic sequences followed by fixation of the optimal codons ) and genetic drift ( allowing for the occurrence of non - optimal codons ) . in fact",
    ", highly expressed genes feature an extreme bias by using a small subset of codons , optimized by translational selection @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the persistence of non - optimal codons in less - expressed sequences causes long breaks during protein synthesis ; this could be the result of genetic drift and have a key role in the protein folding process @xcite .",
    "in addition , codon usage appears to be structured along the genome , with neighboring genes having similar codon compositions @xcite , and codon bias seems positively correlated to gene length ( as a result of selection for accuracy in the costly production of long proteins ) @xcite . in the last years",
    "there has been a wide effort in developing effective ways to measure codon bias @xcite .",
    "the most widely used indices include the _ codon adaptation index _",
    "( @xmath2 ) @xcite , the _ trna adaptation index _ ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , and the _ effective number of codons _ ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , each of them having specific advantages and drawbacks .",
    "for instance , @xmath2 and @xmath1 correlate well with gene expression levels , however such correlation is a natural consequence of their definition : they are tuned on a reference set of highly expressed genes .",
    "@xmath3 is instead basically a measure of the entropy of the codon usage distribution , and thus shows a lower correlation with expression levels .    in this work",
    "we propose a novel codon bias index named _ competition adaptation index _",
    "( @xmath0 ) , which does not rely on information about gene expression levels , but instead has a self - consistent biological meaning  based on trna availability and competition between cognate and near - cognate trnas . in other words",
    ", @xmath0 is a parameter - free index that does not require a set of reference genes for its calibration , a fact that constitutes its main advantage with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is designed to extract genetic signals that could be directly correlated to experimental measures for translation speeds , an emerging and challenging issue still to be explored . in order to show the advantage of the novel codon bias index , we perform a genome - wide comparison of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 for _ escherichia coli _ ( e.coli ) .",
    "our analysis reveals that the information on gene conservation across species and gene essentiality is better captured by codon bias metrics that build on trna availability ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "we also study codon bias in relation to the connectivity patterns of the protein - protein interaction network ( pin ) @xcite of e.coli .",
    "we thus show that translational selection systematically favors proteins with the highest number of interactions and belonging to the most densely connected community of the network , at least when the bias is measured by @xmath0 and , to a smaller extent , by @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , we address the issue of how much a similarity in the codon usage bias of a set of genes is reflected on the interactions among the corresponding proteins .",
    "a principal component analysis for the variability of codon bias indices indeed reveals that closeness of a set of genes in the space of the two principal components likely results in the corresponding proteins to interact  in comparison with an appropriate null model .",
    "overall , our study reveals that @xmath0 captures more information than the other indices about the connection between codon bias and the topology of the interactome . besides , we recall that @xmath0 does not require calibration on gene expression levels and has a consistent biological meaning based on the competition between cognate and near - cognate trnas .",
    "these observations stress the potential of the new index to both measure and explain codon usage bias .",
    "in this work we investigate the genome of e.coli k-12 substr .",
    "mg1655 , whose 4005 coding mrna sequences have been collected from genbank @xcite .",
    "the gene copy numbers coding for each trna ( tgcn ) were derived from the genomic trna database @xcite .      in order to have an index for gene `` conservation '' , we use the normalized evolutionary retention index ( eri ) @xcite : for each gene in e.colis genome , its eri measures how much that gene is shared among other 32 bacterial species ( having at least an ortholog of the given gene ) .",
    "a low eri value thus denotes that a gene is specific to e.coli , whereas , high eri is characteristic of highly shared ( and therefore conserved ) genes .",
    "concerning gene `` essentiality '' , we use the classification of gerdes et al .",
    "@xcite for the e.coli genome into 606 essential and 2940 non - essential genes , based on experimental measures of gene resistance against transposon insertion .      codon usage bias can be assessed , for each gene in a given genome , by various indices that can be classified into broad groups based on : ( i ) codon frequencies ; ( ii ) reference gene sets ; ( iii ) deviation from a postulated distribution ; ( iv ) information theory ; ( v ) interactions among trnas ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "we focus here on the most widely used indices : @xmath1 @xcite , that belongs to groups ( ii ) and ( v ) by requiring calibration on a set of highly expressed genes ; @xmath2 @xcite , a group ( i ) and ( ii ) index built on local statistics of codon usage and on a reference list of optimally expressed genes ; @xmath3 @xcite , a group ( i ) index based on the number of different codons used in a coding sequence .",
    "the novel codon bias index we propose in this work , @xmath0 , is instead based on the competition of cognate and near - cognate trnas to bind to the a - site on the ribosome during translation , and is thus a group ( v ) index that does not need tuning on a reference set of highly expressed genes .",
    "while the formal definition for @xmath0 and the rationale behind are given below , we refer to the supporting information for the operative definition of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 .    * competition adaptation index * ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that translation speed depends on the efficiency of the codon / anticodon pairing in the a site of the ribosome @xcite .",
    "hence , for a given codon , the rate of amino acid synthesis is essentially influenced by two dominant processes : the number of collisions of the corresponding trna with the ribosomal a site ( which strongly depends on trna concentration in the cell ) and the specificity of the codon - anticodon pairing .",
    "such a pairing process satisfies the watson - crick base - pairing rules ( g - c and a - u , and vice versa ) for the first two bases , whereas , the rule on the third ( or _ wobble _ ) base is more relaxed and non - standard pairing is allowed in some cases ( wobble complementarity)@xcite .",
    "hence , there are cases in which several trnas pair with the same codon ( provided that these are identical in the first two bases ) and are called isoacceptor or cognate trnas .",
    "codon - anticodon interactions are thus characterized by competition between cognate trna ( with perfect or wobble complementarity between mrna codon and trna anticodon ) , near - cognate trna ( with a mismatch in only one of the first two bases ) and non - cognate trna ( with at least two mismatches ) .",
    "discrimination between correct and wrong trna according to base pairing features very high fidelity ( error rate @xmath6 ) .",
    "rejection of the wrong trna can occur in two distinct phases @xcite : initial selection of the ternary complex ef - tu - gtp - aa - trna and subsequent proofreading of aa - trna after gtp hydrolyzation .",
    "the first interaction is fast and does not depend on the choice of codons , in order to allow the ribosome to quickly screen for the available trnas .",
    "the second step is instead sensitive to base complementarity , featuring the first selection between cognate and near - cognate trnas : non - cognate are excluded almost immediately with @xmath7 , and then a more strict and efficient proofreading takes place , excluding near - cognate with @xmath8 .",
    "this means that near - cognate trna ( unlike non - cognate trna ) can enter into the interaction process between the ternary complex and the site a of the ribosome , and ( when not accepted , in very few cases ) can be rejected at the stage of initial recognition or during proofreading . in any event , this process results in a time delay of translation , because near - cognate rejection brings the ribosome back to the initial state of waiting for the correct trna .",
    "the rationale behind the definition of @xmath0 is precisely that of building an index which is based both on trna availability and on competition between cognate and near - cognate trnas that could modulate the speed of translation of mrnas into proteins .",
    "note that , since in vivo experimental determinations of trna concentrations are available only for few organisms , we will implement @xmath0 using the number of trna gene copies ( tgcn ) which , at least in simple organisms , has a high and positive correlation with trna abundance @xcite ( a similar approach is adopted in the definition of @xmath1 @xcite ) . for each codon",
    "@xmath9 we define its absolute adaptiveness value ( @xmath10 ) as : @xmath11.\\ ] ] here @xmath12 is the number of isoacceptor trna sequences ( anticodons ) that recognize codon @xmath9 ( _ i.e. _ , containing either the anti - codon @xmath9 or all its cognates that are read by @xmath9 ) and @xmath13 is the gene copy number of the @xmath14-th of such trnas , whereas @xmath15 is the number of trna sequences that are near - cognate of @xmath9 and @xmath16 is the gene copy number of the @xmath14-th of such trnas ( see also fig . [ fig.cognate ] of supporting figures ) .",
    "the amount in square brackets represents a penalty introduced by the competition with near - cognate trnas , assuming unit or zero values in the cases of smaller and higher competition , respectively .",
    "this term thus assumes the role of selective constraint on the efficiency of the codon - anticodon coupling .",
    "importantly , and at odds with @xmath1 , these terms do not result from optimization on expression levels , but have a biological justification based on cognate / near - cognate competition . note that , in the computation of @xmath10 for a given codon , we count as isoacceptor trnas those with perfect or wobble base pairing that also carry the same amino acid of @xmath9 s anticodon .",
    "computation of @xmath0 continues by defining for each codon @xmath9 its relative adaptiveness value @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the maximum value between all the @xmath10 of codons .",
    "@xmath0 of gene @xmath19 is finally defined as the harmonic mean of the relative adaptiveness of its codons : @xmath20 the choice of the harmonic mean ( rather than geometric as for @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) is consistent with the association of @xmath0 with the rate of protein synthesis .",
    "indeed , the translation speed of codon @xmath9 can be defined as the reciprocal of the concentration of the corresponding trna isoacceptors @xcite .",
    "therefore , if codon @xmath9 is read at a speed proportional to @xmath21 , then the average translation speed of a gene is given by the harmonic mean of the @xmath22 associated to its codons .",
    "@xmath0 takes values between 0 and 1 , where values close to 0 ( 1 ) indicate highest ( lowest ) competition , and therefore a low ( high ) translation rate .      in this study we use protein interaction data collected in string ( known and predicted protein - protein interactions ) @xcite . in such database , each predicted interaction is assigned with a confidence level or probability @xmath23 , evaluated by comparing predictions obtained by the different techniques @xcite with a set of reference associations , namely the functional groups of kegg ( kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ) @xcite . in this way ,",
    "interactions with high @xmath23 are likely to be true positives , whereas , a low @xmath23 likely corresponds to a false positive .",
    "since the percentage of false positives can be very high @xcite , we select a stringent cut - off @xmath24 that allows a fair balance between coverage and interaction reliability ( see the probability distribution @xmath25 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.p_kw ] of supporting figures ) .",
    "we thus build the protein - protein interaction network ( pin ) of e.coli by placing a link between each pair of proteins ( nodes ) @xmath26 provided that @xmath27 . the resulting number of connections or _",
    "degree _ for a given protein @xmath9 is denoted as @xmath28 .    to detect communities of pin we resort to molecular complex detection ( mcode ) @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "mcode iteratively groups together neighboring nodes with similar values of the core - clustering coefficient , which for each node is defined as the density of the highest @xmath29-core of its immediate neighborhood times @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "mcode detects the densest regions of the network and assigns to each found community a score that is its internal link density times the number of nodes belonging to it @xcite .",
    "we also characterize each found community @xmath30 with the mean value @xmath31 and standard deviation @xmath32 of codon bias values within the community , and use them to compute a @xmath33-score as @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the mean value and standard deviation of codon bias values computed on the whole network ) . in this way",
    ", a value of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) indicates that community @xmath30 features significantly higher ( lower ) codon bias than the population mean .    finally note that",
    "each node of pin is photogenically classified according to the clusters of orthologous groups @xcite ( cogs ) of proteins @xcite .",
    "cogs are generated by comparing predicted and known protein sequences in all completely sequenced genomes to infer sets of orthologs .",
    "each cog consists of a group of proteins found to be orthologous across at least three lineages and likely corresponds to an ancient conserved domain @xcite .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite is a multivariate statistical method to transform a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables ( called principal components ) spanning a space of lower dimensionality .",
    "the transformation is defined so that the first principal component accounts for the largest possible variance of the data , and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to ( _ i.e. _ , uncorrelated with ) the preceding components .",
    "we use this technique on the space of codon bias indices , so that each gene of e.coli is represented as a 4-dimensional vector with coordinates ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "such coordinates are separately normalized to zero mean and unit variance over the whole genome .",
    "we then obtain the associated covariance matrix between the four dimensions of codon bias and diagonalize it .",
    "the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix , ordered according to the magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalues , are the principal components of the original data .      in order to assess how significant are the codon usage patterns observed for the pin , we need to compare the e.coli interactome with a suitable null model for it , _",
    "i.e. _ , an appropriate randomization of the network . here",
    "we follow the most common approach in statistical mechanics of networks of using the _ configuration model _ ( cm ) @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to build the null model as an ensemble @xmath39 of graphs with maximum entropy , except that the ensemble average of the node degrees are constrained to the values observed for the real network : @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to a probability distribution over @xmath39 which is defined via a set of lagrange multipliers @xmath42 ( one for each node ) associated to the constraints @xcite .",
    "once all @xmath42 are found , the cm reduces to having a link between nodes @xmath9 and @xmath14 with probability @xmath43 , independently on all other links .",
    "then , the null hypothesis is that any given network property @xmath44 varies in the range @xmath45 $ ] , where both average and standard deviation of @xmath44 over the ensemble can be obtained either analytically or numerically ( by drawing sample networks from @xmath39 ) @xcite .",
    "the number of standard deviations by which the empirical and expected values of @xmath44 differ is given by the @xmath33-score @xmath46=(\\chi-\\langle \\chi \\rangle_{\\omega})/\\sigma_{\\omega}[\\chi]$ ] : large positive ( negative ) values of @xmath46 $ ] indicate that @xmath47 is substantially larger ( smaller ) than expected , whereas , small values signal no significant deviation from the null model .",

    "our genome - wide analysis of codon bias in e.coli using @xmath0 as well as other commonly used indices revealed that codon usage metrics resting on counting trna genes ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) are strongly and positively correlated among themselves  in spite of their conceptually different definition .",
    "it would then be quite interesting to check in the future whether this correlation is specific to e.coli or it is universally observed in the genomes of bacterial species that are either ecologically and evolutionarily close or , by contrast , very far from e.coli .",
    "we also found that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 correlate with eri , the degree of conservation for a gene among similar species , and gene essentiality , whereas , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are less sensitive to these quantities . @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 values also allow to distinguishing three groups of genes , that are differently characterized by both codon choice adaptation , eri and degree of essentiality , and that also feature specific predominant cog signatures .",
    "in particular the third group ( c ) , composed of the few genes that are highly conserved and with the strongest codon bias adaptation , consists for 30% of essential genes with predominant cogs j and l  that refer to translation , ribosome structure and biogenesis , replication , recombination and repair .",
    "these represent house - keeping and control functions that must be continuously executed by the cell , meaning that the genes responsible for them have to be expressed most of the time during the cell cycle .",
    "these observations strongly support the idea that an increasing selection of codons and , in parallel , a correlated modulation of trna availability co - evolved along the evolutionary history of a species .",
    "finally , we have addressed a theme as relevant as the connection between codon usage bias and protein functional or physical interactions .",
    "our main result indicates that , in the course of the evolution of a genome , the functional structuring of the complex of interactions between proteins has interfered with the peculiar codon - coding formulation of the corresponding genes .",
    "in particular we have shown here , for the first time to our knowledge , that communities of highly connected proteins in the interactome of e.coli correspond to encoding genes that share the same degree of evolutionary adaptation , as expressed by codon bias indices that synthetically represent genetic information encoded in the trnas sector of the genome .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 , that is based on a simple representation of trna competition , seems to detect the codon bias signal behind communities more consistently than the other indices here considered .",
    "conversely , we have provided evidence that if two genes have similar codon usage patterns then the corresponding proteins have a significant probability of being functionally connected and interacting .",
    "this result points out that codon bias should be a relevant parameter in the fundamental problem of predicting unknown protein - protein interactions from genomic information .",
    "this study is a first exploratory step towards a more complete investigation on how communities within protein - protein interaction networks rest on a consistent but still to be decoded codon bias signal .",
    "indeed , the connection of the topology of a network with an underneath semantics is far from trivial , as recently pointed out in the specialized literature @xcite .",
    "biological pins and codon bias offer an interesting case study worth to be investigated in a wider perspective @xcite .",
    "here we define and explain the rationale behind the various codon bias indices that have been proposed in the literature .    * codon adaptation index * ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the pattern of codon usage is ruled by two simultaneous effects @xcite : translational selection towards optimal codons for each amino acid , and genetic drift that allows the persistence of non - optimal codons .",
    "it is natural to assume that selection is stronger for codons of highly expressed genes , which thus feature a more pronounced bias in the use of codons .",
    "the principle behind @xmath2 is exactly that codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal the optimal ( _ i.e. _ , most efficient for translation ) codons for each amino acid .",
    "hence , @xmath2 builds on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess , for each codon @xmath9 , the relative synonymous codon usages ( @xmath69 ) and the relative codon adaptiveness ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath70 in the @xmath69 , @xmath71 is the number of occurrences of codon @xmath9 in the genome , and the sum in the denominator runs over the @xmath72 synonyms of @xmath9 ; @xmath73s thus measure codon usage bias within a family of synonymous codons .",
    "@xmath21 is then defined as the usage frequency of codon @xmath9 compared to that of the optimal codon for the same amino acid encoded by @xmath9_i.e .",
    "_ , the one which is mostly used in a reference set of highly expressed genes .",
    "the @xmath2 for a given gene @xmath19 is calculated as the geometric mean of the usage frequencies of codons in that gene , normalized to the maximum @xmath2 value possible for a gene with the same composition of amino acid : @xmath74 where the product runs over the @xmath75 codons belonging to that gene ( except the stop codon ) .",
    "the critical aspect in the definition of @xmath2 is that it requires to define _ a priori _ reference set of highly expressed genes that is specific for a given organism .",
    "@xmath2 is then not always transferable ; yet , since it is tuned on highly expressed genes , it is generally well correlated with gene expression levels in genomes for which reference gene sets are available . in this work ,",
    "@xmath2 for e.coli genes was computed using the dambe 5.0 package @xcite    * trna adaptation index * ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the speed of protein synthesis is bound to the waiting time for the correct trna to enter the ribosomal a site @xcite , and thus depends on trna concentrations @xcite ( and , indirectly , on gene copy numbers ) .",
    "the consequent adaptation of codon usage to trna availability @xcite is at the basis of @xmath1 , which follows the same mathematical model of @xmath2defining for each codon @xmath9 its absolute ( @xmath10 ) and relative ( @xmath21 ) adaptiveness value : @xmath76 where @xmath12 is the number of isoacceptor trnas that recognize codon @xmath9 ( _ i.e. _ , trnas that carry the same aminoacid that is encoded by @xmath9 ) , tgcn@xmath77 is the gene copy number of the @xmath14-th trna that recognizes the @xmath9-th codon , @xmath78 is a selective constraint on the efficiency of the codon - anticodon coupling , @xmath18 is the maximum @xmath10 value and @xmath79 is the geometric mean of all @xmath21 with @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath1 of gene @xmath19 is eventually defined as the geometric mean of the relative adaptiveness values of its codons , thus estimating the amount of adaptation of gene @xmath19 to its genomic trna pool : @xmath81 the critical issue for @xmath1 is the selection of a meaningful set of @xmath78 values , _",
    "i.e. _ , weights that represent wobble interactions between codons and trnas . assuming that trna usage is maximal for highly expressed genes , these values are chosen in order to optimize the correlation of @xmath1 values with expression levels",
    " exactly as @xmath2 . besides , while the efficiencies of the different codon - trna interactions are expected to vary among different organisms , @xmath78 values are based on the gene expression in _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _",
    "@xcite  thus lacking universality @xcite . in this work we have evaluated @xmath1 values of e.coli genes using the codonr package @xcite .",
    "* effective number of codons * ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is a measure that quantifies the departure of a gene from the random usage of synonymous codons .",
    "given a sequence of interest , the computation of @xmath3 @xcite starts from the quantity  defined for each family @xmath82 of synonymous codons : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of codons in @xmath82 ( each appearing @xmath85 times in the sequence ) and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath3 then weights these quantities in order to measure amount of entropy in the codon usage of the sequence : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of families with one codon only and @xmath89 is the number of families with degeneration @xmath90 ( families with degeneration 6 are divided into two families of degeneration 2 and 4 , as they often are subject to different selective forces ) .",
    "note that @xmath3 reaches is maximal value ( 61 ) when all codons are used equally and its minimal value ( 23 ) when only one codon is used per amino acid ( extreme bias ) . differently from both @xmath2 and @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath3 is a more immediate measure of codon usage that does not require any _ a priori _ information nor makes any biological hypothesis ( which constitute its weakness and , and the same time , its strength ) . yet",
    ", since the effect of selection is a reduction of entropy for codon usage in a sequence , @xmath3 provides a reliable measure for this effect . in this paper",
