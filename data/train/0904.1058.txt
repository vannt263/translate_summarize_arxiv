    "entanglement is one of the most remarkable features of quantum mechanics which can not be understood in the context of classical physics .",
    "it has been shown that entanglement can exist in various physical systems and play a role in quantum phenomena @xcite . moreover , its properties can be used as a resource for quantum information technologies such as quantum computing , quantum cryptography , and quantum communication @xcite . therefore , detecting entanglement is one of the most essential tasks both for studying fundamental quantum properties and for applications in quantum information processing .",
    "although various entanglement detection schemes have been proposed @xcite , their experimental realization suffers from imperfections of realistic detectors since measurement errors wash out quantum correlations .",
    "this difficulty becomes more significant with increasing system dimensionality and particularly in continuous variable systems where entanglement is increasingly attracting interest @xcite .",
    "quantum tomography provides a method to reconstruct complete information of quantum states in phase space formalism @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed data can be used to determine whether the state is entangled or not with the help of an entanglement witness ( ew ) .",
    "bell inequalities that were originally derived for discriminating quantum mechanics from local realism @xcite can also be used for witnessing entanglement since their violation guarantees the existence of entanglement .",
    "banaszek and wdkiewicz ( bw ) @xcite suggested a bell - type inequality ( referred to bw - inequality in this paper ) which can be tested by way of reconstructing the wigner function at a few specific points of phase space .",
    "however , imperfections of tomographic measurements constitute a crucial obstacle for its practical applications .",
    "several schemes have been considered to overcome this problem @xcite such as numerical inversion @xcite and maximum - likelihood estimation @xcite , but they require a great amount of calculations or iteration steps for high dimensional and continuous variable systems .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative entanglement detection scheme in phase space formalism , which can be used in the presence of detection noise .",
    "we formulate an entanglement witness ( ew ) in the form of a bell - like inequality using the experimentally measured wigner function . for this",
    ", we include the effects of detection efficiency into possible measurement outcomes .",
    "possible expectation values of the entanglement witness are bounded by the maximal expectation value when separable states are assumed .",
    "any larger expectation value guarantees the existence of entanglement .",
    "our approach shows the following remarkable features : ( i ) in contrast to previous proposals @xcite it does not require any additional process for correcting measurement errors ; ( ii ) it allows us to witness entanglement e.g. in single - photon entangled and two - mode squeezed states with detection efficiency as low as 40% ; ( iii ) our scheme is also valid when the precise detection efficiency is not known prior to the test ; ( iv ) finally , we note that our approach is applicable to detect any quantum state represented in phase space formalism .",
    "we begin by introducing an observable associated with the detection efficiency @xmath0 and an arbitrary complex variable @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the displaced parity operator and @xmath4 is the identity operator .",
    "@xmath5 is the displaced number state produced by applying the glauber displacement operator @xmath6 to the number state @xmath7 .",
    "let us then consider the expectation value of observable ( [ eq : obop ] ) when the measurement is carried out with efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "in general , measurement errors occur when not all particles are counted in the detector .",
    "thus the real probability distribution of particles , @xmath8 , transforms to another distribution , @xmath9 , by the generalized bernoulli transformation @xcite : @xmath10 .",
    "thus the expectation value of the parity operator is obtained as @xmath11 where @xmath12 implies the statistical average measured with efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the measured and real particle number distributions in the phase space displace by @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we define the wigner function experimentally measured with efficiency @xmath0 as @xmath15 which is given as a rescaled wigner function by gaussian smoothing .",
    "note that a smoothed wigner function can be identified with a @xmath16-parameterized quasi - probability function as @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this identification is available both for homodyne @xcite and number counting tomography methods @xcite .",
    "after series of measurements with efficiency @xmath0 , we can obtain the expectation value of the observable ( [ eq : obop ] ) as @xmath19 which is bounded as @xmath20 for all @xmath0 .",
    "let us formulate an entanglement witness ( ew ) in the framework of phase space .",
    "suppose that two separated parties , alice and bob , measure one of two observables , denoted by @xmath21 , @xmath22 for alice and @xmath23 , @xmath24 for bob .",
    "all observables are variations of the operator ( [ eq : obop ] ) as @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "we then formulate a hermitian operator as a combination of each local observable @xmath28 , @xmath29 in the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the correlation operator .",
    "we call @xmath32 an entanglement witness operator . note that the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bop ] ) can also be regarded as a bell operator @xmath33 which distinguishes non - local properties from local realism .",
    "the bound expectation value of the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bop ] ) is determined according to whether it is regarded as @xmath32 or @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement criterion given by the operator ( [ eq : bop ] ) is different with the non - locality criterion as we will show below .",
    "let us firstly obtain the bound expectation value of the operator ( [ eq : bop ] ) as an entanglement witness by which one can discriminate entangled states and separable states .",
    "for a separable state @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the expectation value of the correlation operator measured with efficiency @xmath0 is given by @xmath37 since expectation values of all local observables with efficiency @xmath0 are bounded as @xmath38 for @xmath27 , we can obtain the statistical maximal bound of the entanglement witness operator ( [ eq : bop ] ) with respect to the separable states : @xmath39 therefore , if @xmath40 for a quantum state @xmath41 , we can conclude that the quantum state @xmath41 is entangled .",
    "let us then consider the operator ( [ eq : bop ] ) as a bell operator .",
    "note that the local - realistic ( lr ) bound of a bell operator is given as the extremal expectation value of the bell operator , which is associated with a deterministic configuration of all possible measurement outcomes .",
    "if @xmath42 , the maximal modulus outcome of ( [ eq : obop ] ) is @xmath43 when the outcome of parity operator @xmath44 is measured as @xmath45 .",
    "thus the expectation value of ( [ eq : bop ] ) is bounded by local realism as @xmath46 .",
    "likewise for @xmath47 , we can obtain @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 for all @xmath0 , and @xmath50 in the case of unit efficiency ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "it shows that some entanglement can exist without violating local realism , and thus the bell operator can be regarded as a non - optimal entanglement witness as pointed out already in @xcite . for the purpose of this paper we will focus on the role of an entanglement witness in the following parts",

    "( [ eq : bfinsw ] ) for detecting entangled photons .",
    "we here firstly consider the single photon entangled state @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the state with zero ( one ) photons in the mode of alice and one ( zero ) photon in the mode of bob @xcite .",

    "[ fig6 - 1](a ) against the overall efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "it is remarkable that entanglement can be detected even with detection efficiency @xmath0 as low as 40% .",
    "let us consider the entanglement witness in continuous variable systems e.g. two - mode squeezed states ( tmsss ) .",
    "this state can be generated by non - degenerate optical parametric amplifiers @xcite , and be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the squeezing parameter . the measured wigner function with efficiency @xmath0 for a two - mode squeezed state",
    "is given by @xmath75 and its marginal single - mode winger function is @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the expectation values of the entanglement witness operator ( [ eq : bop ] ) for two - mode squeezed states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 - 1](b ) with different squeezing rates @xmath65 .",
    "it shows that our scheme allows one to detect some continuous variable entanglement with detector efficiency of about 40 % . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 - 1](c ) , violations of the inequality show different tendencies depending on efficiency @xmath0 with increasing the squeezing parameter @xmath65 . in the case of low squeezing rates the violation",
    "is maximized when @xmath68 , while for larger squeezing rates about @xmath79 the violation is maximized when @xmath51 .",
    "this is because the dominant degree of freedom of entanglement detected by observable in eq .",
    "( [ eq : obop ] ) changes with decreasing the efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath68 the dominant contribution to the entanglement arises from quantum correlations between the vacuum and the photon being present , while for @xmath51 it comes from higher - order correlations of photon number states .",
    "as varying the estimated efficiency @xmath80 for an input of ( a ) a single photon entangled state and ( b ) a two - mode squeezed state with @xmath61 ( black ) and @xmath62 ( grey).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    so far it has been assumed that the detector efficiency is known precisely prior to the tests both in our scheme presented above and in other proposals proposed previously @xcite .",
    "this can be realized e.g. by a full characterization of detectors when doing a quantum tomography on the detectors which has been experimentally achieved @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases _ a priori _ estimates of the detector efficiency ( @xmath81 ) may not be perfect and thus can be different from the real efficiency @xmath0 that affects measured data .",
    "let us assume that we can discriminate perfectly only whether the real efficiency @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath83 , we can see that the entanglement witness in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfinsw ] ) is formulated only by experimentally measured wigner functions .",
    "thus , in this case our ew can be tested without knowing the real efficiency . on the other hand , for the case @xmath82 , the efficiency variable @xmath0",
    "is explicitly included in the entanglement witness ( [ eq : bfinsw ] ) and should be replaced with the estimated efficiency @xmath80 as @xmath84\\\\ \\nonumber    & + & \\frac{\\pi(\\varepsilon-1)}{\\varepsilon^2}[w^{\\eta}_{a=1 }    + w^{\\eta}_{b=1 } ]    + 2(1-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})^2 \\biggr| ~\\leq 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbfinsw ] ) is valid subject to the condition @xmath85 since otherwise the right - hand side of inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbfinsw ] ) is not valid i.e. the expectation values of separable states are not bounded by @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", one can also detect entanglement even with non - perfect estimates of the efficiency as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 - 2 ] . for example , even when one estimates the efficiency as @xmath86 for the detector with real efficiency @xmath87 , one can still detect entanglement of the two - mode squeezed state with @xmath61 using our scheme .",
    "we have formulated an entanglement witness that allows one to detect entanglement even with significantly imperfect detectors . the proposed entanglement witness in ( [ eq : bfinsw ] )",
    "can be used to test arbitrary quantum states represented in phase space using the wigner function .",
    "it can be implemented by both homodyne @xcite and number counting tomography methods @xcite without additional steps for correcting measurement errors . moreover , since the required minimal efficiency for our scheme is as low as 40% , it may be realizable using current detection technologies .",
    "in addition , our entanglement witness can be used without knowing the detection efficiency precisely prior to the test , which may allow more realistic implementation .",
    "we note that our approach is applicable to e.g. cavity qed or ion trap systems with the help of the direct measurement scheme of wigner function in such systems @xcite",
    ". it will be also valuable to apply our scheme to quantum cryptography in which witnessing entanglement is a primal step for secure quantum key distribution @xcite .",
