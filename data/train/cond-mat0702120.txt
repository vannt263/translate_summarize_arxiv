    "after quenching a system from an high temperature disordered state to an ordered phase with broken ergodicity , a phase - ordering kinetics is observed , characterized by coarsening of quasi - equilibrated domains with a typical size @xmath1 .",
    "although a first - principle theory of phase - ordering is presently lacking , for systems defined on homogeneous lattices a substantial comprehension of the dynamics has been achieved by means of exact solutions of soluble cases , approximate theories and numerical simulations  @xcite . while the inner of domains is basically in equilibrium at the quench temperature , the off - equilibrium behavior is provided by the slow evolution of their boundaries . as a consequence , at each time @xmath2 , for space separations @xmath3 or for time separations @xmath4 intra - domains quasi - equilibrium properties are probed , while for @xmath5 or @xmath6 one explores inter - domains properties , where the aging behavior is observed .",
    "accordingly , the correlation of the order parameter @xmath7 between sites @xmath8 at times @xmath9 can be expressed as the sum of two terms _ ij(t , s)=c^st_ij(t - s)+c^ag_ij(t , s ) . [ 1 ] the first term describes the equilibrium contribution provided by the interior of domains while the second contains the non - equilibrium information .",
    "analogously , also the integrated response function , or zero field cooled magnetization , measured on site @xmath10 at time @xmath11 after a perturbation has switched on in @xmath12 from time @xmath2 onwards , takes an analogous addictive form _",
    "ij(t , s)=^st_ij(t - s)+^ag_ij(t , s ) .",
    "[ 1a ] on regular lattices , due to space homogeneity and isotropy , correlation and response function depend only on the distance @xmath13 between @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "one has , therefore , @xmath14 , and similarly for @xmath15 .    at the heart of the non - equilibrium behavior",
    "is the dynamical scaling symmetry , a self - similarity where time acts solely as a length rescaling .",
    "when scaling holds , the states sequentially entered by the system are statistically equivalent provided lengths are measured in units of the characteristic size @xmath1 of ordered domains . all the time dependence must enter through @xmath1 , and the aging parts in eqs .",
    "( [ 1],[1a ] ) take a scaling form in terms of rescaled variables  @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 ^ag(r , t , s)=(x , y ) , [ 2 ] ^ag(r , t , s)=s^-a_(x , y ) .",
    "[ 2a ] the characteristic length grows according to a power law @xmath18 .",
    "non - equilibrium exponents such as @xmath19 , are expected to be universal .",
    "namely , they depend only on a restrict set of parameters , such as space dimensionality and number of components @xmath20 of the order parameter , on the conservation laws of the dynamics and are independent on temperature .    in defiance of this basic comprehension in homogeneous systems ,",
    "our understanding of phase - ordering on inhomogeneous structures is particularly poor , although examples , ranging from disordered materials , to percolation clusters , glasses , polymers , and biomolecules , may be abundantly found in physics , economics , chemistry and biology  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the phase - ordering kinetics of the ising model with non - conserved order parameter on some _ physical graphs _",
    "@xcite , namely networks with the appropriate topological features to represent real physical structures .",
    "these structures are constrained to be embeddable in a finite dimensional space and to have bounded coordination number . among these",
    ", we consider random fractals , i.e. percolation clusters , and geometrical fractals , such as the sierpinski gasket and carpet and others ( see all the cases considered in fig .  [ strutture ] ) .",
    "we discuss the results of numerical simulations and compare them with the predictions provided by a large-@xmath20 model , where exact calculations can be carried out  @xcite . in the large-@xmath20 model the general framework of scaling behavior is maintained on generic graphs , and the exponents depend on the topology of the network only through the fractal dimension @xmath21 and the spectral dimension @xmath22 , a large scale parameter encoding the relevant topology .",
    "in particular , one finds @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this general framework provided by the soluble model seems to be quite unrepresentative of the real situation in scalar systems , as observed in  @xcite and in our simulations .",
    "a basic feature missed is the fundamental role played by activated processes on inhomogeneous structures .",
    "actually , on homogeneous structures the temperature is an irrelevant parameter , in the sense of the renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "long - time , large - scale properties do not depend on the quench temperature in the whole low temperature phase .",
    "exponents related to the aging behavior are then independent of the thermal noise . on the other hand , structure inhomogeneities",
    "exert a pinning force on interfaces or other topological defects , whose further evolution can only be mediated by activated processes .",
    "activated processes may be present in non disordered models on regular lattices as well , where they sometimes play a fundamental role , but without changing large - scale , long - time properties . on fractal sets , on the other hand , pinning forces are exerted on all lengthscales and contribute to the aging behavior .",
    "these forces causes a stop - and - go behavior hindering the power laws and preventing a straightforward definition of the exponents . at relatively high temperatures , where pinning barriers are more easily surmounted , slip - stick effects are less severe . in these cases",
    "the general scaling scheme  ( [ 2],[2a ] ) can be investigated and the non equilibrium exponents can be defined .",
    "it turns out , however , that pinning forces are still subtly at work , making exponents temperature dependent .    a notable exception in this vague scenario is represented by the response function exponent @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , at variance with all the other exponents , its value only depends on the structure considered , is independent on temperature and on the presence of stick - slip intermittency .",
    "this universal character calls for a strict and direct relation between @xmath0 and precise topological properties of the network , bypassing any microscopic dynamical mechanism .",
    "we develop an argument showing the relation between this exponent and fundamental equilibrium properties .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 must take a positive value whenever the statistical model on the network considered has a phase transition at a finite critical temperature @xmath25 , whereas @xmath26 on structures with @xmath27 .",
    "the same picture is provided by the solution of the large-@xmath20 model on graphs .",
    "this is what we find , with good accuracy , in the simulation of discrete symmetry models on all the inhomogeneous structures considered .",
    "we measure @xmath26 or @xmath28 whenever structures with @xmath27 or @xmath29 are considered . given the fundamental role of topological and connectivity properties in determining equilibrium and critical behavior  @xcite our results provide an evidence for some relationship between non - equilibrium kinetics and large scale topology on general networks and suggest that the same topological features of graphs determine critical behavior and non - equilibrium exponent @xmath0 during phase ordering @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the ising model that will be considered in the simulations .",
    "we also introduce the basic observables , and discuss the numerical techniques . in sec.[structures",
    "] we discuss the outcome of the numerical simulations on different structures .",
    "in particular , subsection  [ phasetr ] is devoted to structures with a finite @xmath25 , namely the percolation cluster above @xmath30 , the sierpinski carpet and toblerone lattices , while subsection  [ phasetr ] deals with structures with @xmath27 : the percolation cluster above @xmath30 , the sierpinski gasket and the t - fractal . in sec .",
    "[ response ] we discuss the value of the exponent @xmath0 in all the cases considered , and the form of the fluctuation - dissipation plots .",
    "[ concl ] contains a final discussion and the conclusions .",
    "the ising model is defined by the hamiltonian h[]=-j_<ij>_i _ j , [ hamiltonian ] where @xmath31 is a unitary spin and @xmath32 are nearest neighbours on a graph .",
    "the dynamics is introduced by randomly choosing a single spin and updating it with metropolis transition rate w([])=. [ metropolis ] here @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] are the spin configurations before and after the move , and e = h[]-h [ ] .",
    "[ deltae ]    we consider a system of @xmath35 spins initially prepared in an high temperature uncorrelated state and then quenched , at time @xmath36 , to a low final temperature @xmath37 .",
    "as already discussed , the dynamics of the spins in the bulk of domains provide the equilibrium contribution while what is left over accounts for the aging behavior . since equilibrium dynamics is well understood , the stationary parts in eqs .",
    "( [ 1],[1a ] ) are generally well known . in particular , at @xmath38 equilibrium dynamics is frozen and there are no stationary contributions . on the other hand , much interest is focused on the aging terms",
    ". these can be isolated by subtracting the stationary parts computed in equilibrium , from the whole quantity measured in the phase - ordering stage .",
    "however it is computationally much more efficient to resort to a different method .",
    "this amounts to study a modified system where @xmath37 in the transition rate  ( [ metropolis ] ) is set equal to zero if the spin to be updated belongs to the bulk , namely if it is aligned with all its neighbors . since the bulk degrees of freedom , which alone contribute to the stationary parts , feel @xmath38 , and equilibrium dynamics is frozen at @xmath38 , by computing observables with this modified dynamics one isolates the aging term leaving other properties of the dynamics unchanged  @xcite .",
    "this modified dynamics with no bulk flips ( nbf ) will be used in the following .",
    "the nbf has also the useful property of shifting @xmath25 towards higher values  @xcite . as we will discuss below",
    ", this fact represents a formidable advantage on inhomogeneous graphs .",
    "let us discuss the case of graphs where a phase transition occurs at a finite critical temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we denote these as systems of class i. for these structures we can consider quenches to finite temperatures @xmath39 .",
    "the characteristic size @xmath1 then grows until it becomes comparable with the system size and the new equilibrium state at @xmath37 is globally attained .",
    "we always consider sufficiently large systems to prevent equilibration on the simulated timescales .",
    "the dynamics in this regime is equivalent to that of an infinite system , for which the final equilibrium state is never reached and @xmath1 keeps growing indefinitely . by analogy with regular lattices , in the late stage",
    "one might expect the power law l(t)~t^ , [ ldit ] although some caveats will be discussed in the following . on regular lattices the value @xmath40 is found quite generally . in the solution of the large-@xmath20 model on graphs  @xcite or in the framework of approximate theories  @xcite one finds @xmath23 , but such a relation is not expected for scalar systems .",
    "now we turn to systems of class ii , namely those systems for which , with standard dynamics , @xmath27 . for every finite @xmath37 the system eventually equilibrate to a state with a finite coherence length @xmath41 , which diverges in the @xmath42 limit .",
    "if the temperature is sufficiently low , an interrupted phase - ordering is observed until @xmath1 becomes comparable with @xmath41 and equilibration occurs .",
    "the phase - ordering phenomenon can be widened at will by decreasing @xmath37 , and the scaling behavior with eq .",
    "( [ ldit ] ) can be studied .",
    "quite generally , however , on inhomogeneous structures one can not set @xmath38 directly , because this would freeze the dynamics due to pinning effects .",
    "for the same reason , also very low temperatures are not numerically accessible , since it takes an exponentially long time to surmount pinning barriers .",
    "from the numerical point of view , then , one has to find a reasonable compromise between two contrasting issues .",
    "namely , @xmath37 must be sufficiently low in order to have a wide scaling regime preceding equilibration , but also sufficiently large to allow pinning barriers being overtoped",
    ". this may be in some cases impossible .",
    "fortunately , the use of the nbf dynamics simplifies considerably the problem .",
    "as we have already pointed out , with nbf the critical temperature is raised . in the case of system where @xmath27 with standard dynamics ,",
    "the effect of nbf is to move @xmath25 from zero to some finite value .",
    "then one has a whole low - temperature region where phase - ordering occurs asymptotically without being interrupted by equilibration , much alike in systems of class i. this allows to study the scaling behavior also in this case . for all the reasons discussed above , in this paper we will always present results obtained with nbf dynamics .",
    "generally speaking , when scaling holds the characteristic length @xmath1 can be estimated from the knowledge of the two - points equal time correlation function , obtained letting @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) g_i , j^ag(t)=_i(t ) _",
    "j(t ) [ gdir ] where @xmath44 means an ensemble average , namely taken over different initial conditions and thermal histories . in homogeneous systems according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) one has g_i , j^ag(t)=g^ag(r , t)=g(x ) , [ gdirscal ] where @xmath45 . for scalar order parameter with sharp interfaces , a short distance behavior ( @xmath46 ) of the type @xmath47 is found  @xcite , namely a porod s tail @xmath48 in momentum space for large @xmath49 . with eq .",
    "( [ gdirscal ] ) the characteristic length can then be evaluated , for instance , as the half - height with of @xmath50 , namely from the condition g^ag(r",
    "= l(t),t)=g^ag(0,t ) [ halfh ]    on usual lattices the size of domains can be easily related to the density of interfaces @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , since domains are compact , the ratio between their surface and their volume is proportional to @xmath52 and one has @xmath53 .",
    "since asymptotically @xmath51 has a power law behavior ( t)~t^- , [ rhoscal ] this implies = 1/z .",
    "[ deltascal ] in homogeneous structures , then , @xmath51 provides an indirect , alternative method for the determination of @xmath1 , and hence of @xmath54 .    on generic graphs",
    "the notion of a distance is not as straightforward as on regular lattices and , considering the correlation function  ( [ gdir ] ) one should , in principle , retain the full dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "this would be a formidable task without probably providing much insight into the physics and , in particular , into the scaling behavior .",
    "therefore , in the following , for some of the structures considered in sec .",
    "[ structures ] , we will attempt a _ reasonable _ definition of a distance , we will check the validity of eq .",
    "( [ gdirscal ] ) with respect to this definition and we will compute @xmath1 through eq .  ( [ halfh ] ) .",
    "let us also notice that the relation  ( [ deltascal ] ) does not hold on generic networks , as we will show explicitly in our simulations .",
    "actually , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ nophasetr ] , the number of spins on the surface of a domain of size @xmath1 may depend dramatically on ( among other parameters ) the quench temperature . therefore ,",
    "in general , there is not a unique relation between @xmath51 and @xmath1 and they provide independent informations .",
    "the two time quantities that will be considered in this paper are the ( spatially averaged ) autocorrelation function c(t , s)=1n _ i=1^n _ i ( t)_i ( s ) [ autocorr ] and the integrated ( auto)response function ( t , s)=_s ^t dt r(t , t ) . [ integrated ] the quantity r(t , t)= 1n _ i=1^n . _ h=0 , is the ( spatially averaged ) linear response function associated to the perturbation caused by an impulsive magnetic field @xmath56 switched on at time @xmath57 .    on regular lattices ,",
    "scalings  ( [ 2],[2a ] ) imply c^ag(t , s)=h(y ) [ scalauto ] and ^ag(t , s)=s^-a_f(y ) , [ scalresp ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and the large-@xmath61 behaviors h(y)~y^- , [ largeyc ] f(y)~y^-a _ [ largeychi ]    in order to compute @xmath62 we enforce the out of equilibrium generalization of the fluctuation dissipation theorem derived in  @xcite , which relates the response function to particular correlation functions of the unperturbed system t(t , s)=.

    "[ b ] in this equation @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] are two configurations differing only by the spin on site @xmath10 , taking the values @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "this relation allows to compute the integrated response function by measuring correlation functions on the unperturbed system , avoiding the complications of the traditional methods where a perturbation is applied , and improving significantly the quality of the results  @xcite .",
    "in the following we will present the numerical results .",
    "we set @xmath65 .",
    "statistical errors are comparable to the thickness of the symbols .",
    "we recall that nbf dynamics is always used , and therefore we measure directly the aging part of every observable considered .",
    "let start with systems of class ii , first .",
    "the structures considered in the simulations will be the sierpinski gasket ( sg ) , the t - fractal ( tf ) and the percolation cluster ( pc ) , namely a diluted square lattice , at the the percolation threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ strutture ] ) . the number @xmath35 of spins in this structures is 265722 and 531442 for the sg , and ts , respectively .",
    "the pc has been obtained by means of site percolation on a square lattice of size @xmath66 at the critical dilution @xmath67 the results presented are thermal averages over @xmath68 realizations .    for the sg we have computed the equal time correlation function  ( [ gdir ] ) by restricting @xmath10 and @xmath12 along the borders of the structure .",
    "this allows a natural definition of the distance @xmath13 between @xmath10 and @xmath12 , since along this lines all sites are occupied by spins . for the tf we have computed @xmath69 for points @xmath10 and @xmath12 along the the baseline of the structure .    in fig .",
    "[ scalg1 ] , @xmath70 is plotted against @xmath45 for the sg and the tf .",
    "one finds a very good data collapse , as expected on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ gdirscal ] ) .",
    "this indicates that dynamical scaling is obeyed also on these structures .",
    "notice also the presence of the porod s tail , for small @xmath71 , implying that interfaces are sharp objects at the relatively low temperatures considered in fig .",
    "[ scalg1 ] . however , when the temperature is raised , the interfaces broaden on the fractal substrate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ intergas ] .",
    "here one expects a deviation from the porod linear behavior .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ expporodgasc ] . here",
    "we plot the exponent @xmath72 which regulates the small @xmath71 decay of @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 , as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "clearly , given the choice of @xmath10,@xmath12 described above , our considerations strictly apply only along the particular boundary of the structure where @xmath70 is computed .",
    "however , we expect this results to be representative of the whole system , due to the scale invariance of the structure .    the characteristic size @xmath1 , obtained as in eq .",
    "( [ halfh ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ length1 ] .",
    "this length grows roughly as a power law , but with a superimposed oscillation which is more pronounced at low temperatures .",
    "the origin of such oscillation , which is very reminiscent of what one observes in the related problem of brownian motion on this structure @xcite , are again the pinning forces .",
    "in fact , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schemagas ] for the sg , if two triangles happen to be ordered differently , in order to start reversing one of the two to achieve a global ordering , one has to flip one of the interfacial spins , for example the one marked with an arrow .",
    "this move requires an activation energy @xmath75 and can then be accomplished on a time @xmath76 .",
    "the dynamics then proceeds without activated processes until all the triangle is reversed but , then , a new activated step is required and so on . during the time @xmath77 the dynamics on the triangle in consideration is frozen .",
    "since all the triangles have the same qualitative behavior , with some fluctuations , the overall behavior of @xmath1 shows a periodic oscillation due to the recurring slow down caused by activated processes .",
    "an analogous phenomenon occurs in the tf .",
    "clearly , since @xmath78 decreases at larger temperatures , this phenomenon is less evident , although still present even at relatively high temperatures , as shown on fig .",
    "[ length1 ] .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "[ length1 ] can be quite convincingly fitted by a power law with periodic oscillations superimposed .",
    "the exponent @xmath54 of the power law , however , should be thought as an effective exponent resulting from the balance between non activated processes obeying a growth law  ( [ ldit ] ) with a certain value of @xmath54 , and the activated processes whose net effect is an overall slowing down .",
    "since the relative importance of these two processes is regulated by @xmath37 , @xmath54 turns out to be temperature dependent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ exp ] . on the basis of the previous discussion",
    ", one would expect to have a faster growth , namely a larger @xmath79 , for higher @xmath37 .",
    "this is indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ exp ] in a broad range .",
    "for very large temperatures @xmath79 seems to saturate .",
    "this is perhaps due to the neighborhood of the critical temperature ( that with nbf turns out to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the sg and the tf , respectively ) , slowing down the dynamics much in the same way as it happens on regular lattices .",
    "a pattern similar to that of @xmath1 is observed for @xmath51 .",
    "this quantity , defined as the density of spin which are not fully aligned with their neighbors , is shown in fig .",
    "[ bordi1 ] for the sg , tf and pc . also in this case one observes oscillations on top of the power law behavior  ( [ rhoscal ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath82 also depends on temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ exp ] . differently from @xmath79 , however , the behavior is strongly non monotonous , with a broad maximum at intermediate temperatures .",
    "as already observed , the exponent @xmath83 and @xmath79 are not trivially related , as on homogeneous structures . in the limit of low temperatures",
    "one finds an exponent @xmath83 consistent with @xmath84 , which can be understood on the basis of the following argument .",
    "let us consider again , for simplicity , the sg of fig .  [ schemagas ] .",
    "when the temperature is very low interfaces are very likely located in the pinning positions , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ intergas ] .",
    "a domain , therefore , is a triangle of size @xmath1 , with a volume @xmath85 and a number of surface spins @xmath86 .",

    "let us remark again , however , that , although this relation is consistent with our data in the limit of small @xmath37 , it is not of general validity .",
    "actually , as already evident from fig .  [ intergas ] and from the non linear behavior of @xmath73 at small @xmath71 , for larger temperatures , interfaces are no longer located on the pinning centers .",

    "( [ aphenom ] ) , and @xmath114 or @xmath113 for scalar or vectorial models respectively .",
    "this shows that the non - equilibrium exponent , @xmath0 , is related in a non - trivial way to the topology of the underlying lattice , through @xmath115 .",
    "interestingly , this relation implies @xmath28 when the system is above @xmath112 , i.e. when a phase transition at finite temperature @xmath25 is present , @xmath116 at @xmath112 and @xmath117 below @xmath112 .",
    "this result for regular lattices suggests that the non - equilibrium dynamics of statistical models , and in particular the response function exponent , could be related to important topological properties also in the case of generic graphs .",
    "this hypothesis can be checked in some detail in systems with a continuous symmetry , because in this case it is well known that a large scale parameter , the `` spectral dimension '' @xmath22 , encodes the relevant topological features , uniquely determines the existence of phase transitions  @xcite and controls the critical behavior  @xcite . in other words on generic networks",
    "@xmath22 plays the same role played by the euclidean dimension @xmath115 on regular lattices .",
    "in particular , vectorial models on graphs exhibit a phase transition at finite temperature only if @xmath118 . solving an @xmath109 model in the large-@xmath20 limit @xcite",
    "one can show that this property holds true also for the non - equilibrium exponent @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , one finds the same expression  ( [ aphenom ] ) as for regular lattices , with @xmath22 replacing @xmath115 .",
    "then , again one has @xmath28 when the system is above @xmath112 , i.e. when a phase transition at finite temperature @xmath25 is present , and @xmath119 when @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that , for models with a continuous symmetry there is a well defined relation between the non equilibrium exponent @xmath89 and the topological features of the network which regulate the critical properties . in this case , this features are totally described by a single index , namely @xmath22 .",
    "the next question is if a similar picture hold for scalar systems , where the counterpart of @xmath22 is not known .",
    "namely , if the non equilibrium exponent @xmath89 is related to the critical properties , and in turn to topology , such that @xmath120 or @xmath119 holds for graphs with @xmath29 or @xmath27 respectively . an argument  @xcite based on the topology of class ii networks suggests that @xmath92 is expected for these systems .",
    "the values of @xmath0 reported in the previous section  [ structures ] show quite convincingly that the above conjecture is verified in all the cases considered in our simulations .",
    "one has @xmath121 in all the structures of class ii and @xmath28 in those of class i. this result is particularly interesting for discrete symmetry models .",
    "in fact , while for @xmath109 models the presence of phase transition can be inferred from @xmath22 , there is not a such a general criterion for discrete models .",
    "our data suggest that @xmath89 may be used to infer the presence of phase transition on a generic network .",
    "we recall again that this result directly links @xmath89 to some relevant topological features of graphs . for this reason , although @xmath89 is a non - equilibrium dynamical exponent , it is totally independent on all the non - universal details of the dynamics we have described in sec .",
    "[ structures ] .",
    "we have already observed , in fact , that , differently from all the other dynamical exponent , its value is robust and temperature independent .",
    "finally , we mention that the value @xmath92 found in the structures of class ii is associated to an anomalous fluctuation - dissipation plot  @xcite .",
    "re - parameterizing in @xmath62 the time @xmath11 in terms of @xmath122 , according to the theorem by franz , mezard , parisi and peliti  @xcite , under broad hypoteses the following relation -t_f_s .",

    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , when @xmath92 the theorem  ( [ fmpp ] ) can not be applied and one gets a non - trivial fluctuation - dissipation plot which is not related to @xmath124 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the phase - ordering kinetics of the ising model with spin flip dynamics on a class of physical graphs .",
    "the evolution is in many respects qualitatively similar to what observed on regular lattices .",
    "after the quench one has the formation and growth of domains of the two competing ordered phases , and a scaling symmetry is obeyed quite generally ( except for the sc in the timescale of our simulations ) . however , differently from coarsening on regular lattices , the fractal nature of the networks pins the interfaces on locally stable positions .",
    "escape from the pinned positions is achieved by means of activated processes , but subsequently the interfaces are trapped again . when interfaces are pinned , the growth of the domain size @xmath1 is inhibited .",
    "because of this recurrent phenomenon the usual power growth - law of @xmath1 is modulated by an oscillation , which is more evident when the pinning is stronger , namely at low temperatures .",
    "the necessity of activated moves on all time / space scales makes a great difference with respect to regular lattices . on regular lattices",
    "the temperature is an irrelevant parameter  @xcite , in the sense of the renormalization group .",
    "namely , in all the low temperature region the dynamics is controlled by the zero temperature fixed point .",
    "one has , therefore , the same dynamical exponents in all quenches to @xmath39 , regardless of the temperature . on fractal networks ,",
    "instead , the situation is different , because the dynamics of activated processes are faster the higher is @xmath37 . as a consequence ,",
    "exponents are always found temperature dependent .",
    "a notable exception is the response function exponent @xmath89 , which turns out to be stable and temperature independent .",
    "this already suggests that @xmath89 may be related to a more fundamental property of the system which remains stable under temperature variations .",
    "interestingly , we find @xmath92 on all the considered graphs which do not support a ferro - paramagnetic transition at a finite critical temperature , while @xmath130 in all the other cases . the same situation was found  @xcite on regular lattices , where @xmath0 is related to the euclidean dimension . on these lattices ,",
    "the euclidean dimension is the topological parameter that determines the exhistence of phase transitions and regulates the critical properties .",
    "this calls for the hypoteses that , also on generic graphs , @xmath89 could be related to the relevant topological features which govern the critical behavior , although for systems with a discrete symmetry , such as the ising model considered here , a unique topological indicator , analogous to @xmath115 is not known .",
