    "the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) approximation has some interesting properties , for example , the flux freezing and magnetic pressure ; the former can be used for the collimation of the jet , and the latter for the acceleration of the plasma .",
    "thus , the magnetic field is considered an essential ingredient for many astrophysical phenomena . in particular , many observations indicate that most of the high energy phenomena in astrophysics are related to the strongly magnetized relativistic plasma around some compact objects , for example , agn  @xcite , relativistic jet  @xcite , pulsar wind  @xcite , gamma - ray bursts  @xcite , and so on .",
    "since it is extremely difficult to solve the relativistic mhd ( rmhd ) equations analytically , the theoretical investigations in fully nonlinear regimes are mainly based on the numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies approximates the plasma as the ideal rmhd fluid .",
    "one reason for this is that the ideal rmhd is an excellent approximation of high energy phenomena for ordinary parameters .",
    "however , when one considers extreme phenomena , such as the neutron star mergers , or the central engines of grb , the electrical conductivity can be small , and highly resistive regions may appear .",
    "in addition , when one considers the magnetic reconnection , the resistivity plays an essential role in this phenomenon .",
    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most important phenomena , since it is highly dynamic , and it changes magnetic field energy into fluid energy  @xcite .",
    "though numerical results of ideal rmhd exhibit magnetic reconnection , this originates in the purely numerical resistivity , and this is unphysical . for this reason , using resistive rmhd is important for the understanding of reconnection and related phenomena . in order to consider ohmic dissipation , one only has to take into account an additional term @xmath0 in the induction equation of non - relativistic mhd .",
    "however , similar to other non - relativistic dissipation , this induction equation is parabolic and it is well - known that this equation is acausal . as a result ,",
    "if one takes into account ohmic dissipation in a relativistic mhd in a similar way , the equation inevitably includes unphysical exponential growing modes , and unstable for small perturbations similar to other dissipation  @xcite .",
    "this unphysical divergence results from the fact that one neglects the time derivative of the electric field in the induction equation with ohmic dissipation . for this reason , when one takes into account the ohmic dissipation",
    ", one has to consider the time evolution of the electric field , that is , one has to deal with the relativistic electromagnetic hydrodynamic equation .",
    "this equation is a telegrapher equation , and satisfies the causality . in this paper",
    ", we present a new numerical scheme for the resistive rmhd .",
    "there are several examples of pioneering work for resistive rmhd , for example , komissarov ( 2007 , hereafter k07 ) proposed numerical method that solves hyperbolic fluxes by using the harten - lax - van leer ( hll ) prescription , and damping of the electric field by ohmic dissipation that is very stiff by using strang - splitting techniques ; palenzuela et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter p09 ) proposed a numerical method that solves hyperbolic fluxes by local lax - friedrichs approximate riemann solver , and the stiff part by using implicit - explicit ( imex ) runge kutta methods .",
    "however , these methods use light velocity as the characteristic velocity , and their numerical solutions are diffusive when one considers problems whose characteristic velocity is much lower than light velocity .",
    "this indicates that their numerical solutions are diffusive in many important high plasma @xmath1 dynamics , and also their solutions become highly diffusive when the characteristic velocity of phenomena is much lower than light velocity . in particular , when one solves the dynamics of the accretion disk around a black hole with a relativistic jet",
    ", one has to use relativistic resistive mhd code that can solve both highly relativistic and non - relativistic dynamics with resistivity for the following three reasons : ( 1 ) the saturation of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) depends on the resistivity ; ( 2 ) the dynamics of an accretion disk are not ordinarily relativistic , especially , the dynamics of the mri is sub - alfvnic ; ( 3 ) the dynamics of the jet are highly relativistic . for these reasons , previous schemes are diffusive in such phenomena , and we need more accurate numerical schemes .",
    "we are developing a new numerical scheme capable of accurately solving problems whose characteristic velocity is quite different from light velocity . in this scheme ,",
    "we obtain numerical flux of fluid by using sound velocity as the characteristic velocity , and numerical flux of electromagnetic field by using appropriate characteristic velocities of rmhd .",
    "this enables us to obtain accurate numerical results when we consider problems whose characteristic velocity is much lower than light velocity . in addition , p09 pointed out that the strang - splitting method used in the komissarov method is unstable when applied to discontinuous flows with large conductivities .",
    "however , we find that this problem is not related to the strang - splitting method , but the evolution of electric field @xmath2 during the primitive recovery , that is introduced in the method by p09 . by considering this procedure",

    "<S> we present a new numerical method of special relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics with scalar resistivity that can treat a range of phenomena , from nonrelativistic to relativistic ( shock , contact discontinuity , and alfvn wave ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present scheme calculates the numerical flux of fluid by using an approximate riemann solver , and electromagnetic field by using the method of characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> since this scheme uses appropriate characteristic velocities , it is capable of accurately solving problems that can not be approximated as ideal magnetohydrodynamics and whose characteristic velocity is much lower than light velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results show that our scheme can solve the above problems as well as nearly ideal mhd problems . </S>",
    "<S> our new scheme is particularly well suited to systems with initially weak magnetic field , and mixed phenomena of relativistic and non - relativistic velocity ; for example , mri in accretion disk , and super alfvnic turbulence . </S>"
