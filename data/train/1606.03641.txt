    "realization of multi - agent topologies facilitates in understanding network characteristics , agents interactions and group dynamics in wide range of engineering applications as well as in pedagogical courses @xcite . in network control and dynamics research community ,",
    "the analysis and synthesis of multi - agent topologies have drawn serious attention over the past @xcite .",
    "most of the real world network topologies can be represented mathematically by using their corresponding graphs .",
    "for instance , in cooperative robotics applications @xcite , a multi - agent system is represented by a graph where nodes are the point - robots and edges are the inter - connections between them . in a decentralized network of multiple agents ,",
    "the group performance and task accomplishment depend on agents information sharing ability to their neighbors .",
    "the connectivity measure of a graph , i.e. the _ algebraic connectivity _ , plays vital role in group dynamics as it determines how well the agents can communicate to each other . a connectivity value above zero guarantees that there exists at least one spanning tree @xcite or an information flow path among the members in a group .",
    "earlier research shows a fair amount of contributions @xcite dedicated to maintaining , controlling and maximizing connectivity of a multi - agent network , during cooperative tasks such as target tracking and formation control @xcite .",
    "isospectral systems @xcite exhibit similar dynamic characteristics since they resonate at the same natural frequencies .",
    "the family of graphs that share the same spectrum are called isospectral @xcite .",
    "isospectral graphs also have identical connectivity , however , the converse is not true always .",
    "this is because the connectivity of a graph can be measured just by computing one eigenvalue of the corresponding laplacian ; the entire spectrum is not required .",
    "there exist different multi - agent graphs that have the same connectivity measure , and so the inverse problem of identifying a particular topology from just the connectivity is not unique .",
    "the present work focuses on finding distinct graphs with the same connectivity .",
    "these graphs @xcite have significant applications in topology categorization and reconfiguration @xcite during a cooperative mission .",
    "topology categorization offers a variety of formation options to the agents in a group , which can be selected according to the specific application , constraints or surrounding environment during a cooperative task .",
    "the relationship between a multi - agent system dynamics and its corresponding graph properties is critical in terms of the network controllability and stability @xcite , @xcite . for a multi - agent network with one(multiple ) leader(s ) , rahmani et .",
    "al . established how the symmetry structure of a network characterized by automorphism group , relates to the controllability of such network .",
    "tanner @xcite investigated the effects of network connectivity and size on its dynamic controllability in presence of a single leader , considering neighborhood based inter - connection topology structure .",
    "in multi - agent cooperative tasks , an increase in the network connectivity helps in faster convergence of the consensus @xcite .",
    "the author in @xcite derived sufficient conditions for the overall network controllability , and also showed that high connectivity may cause adverse effect on network controllability . in @xcite , the structural controllability problem of multi - agent network with single leader was investigated under switching topologies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we brief the mathematical representation of a multi - agent graph and state the problem objective .",
    "section 3 presents an analytical method of generating graphs with identical spectrum using the similarity transformation . in section 4",
    ", we describe how to find graphs with the same connectivity in a network with just one mobile agent .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes the present work .",
    "a graph @xmath0 consisting of @xmath1 agents can be captured mathematically @xcite by the associated laplacian matrix @xmath2 of order @xmath1 . in this work ,",
    "all the graphs are assumed as undirected with bidirectional inter - agent communication links .",
    "the laplacian matrix is the difference between the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees and the adjacency matrix of inter - agent connections , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "laplacian is a symmetric positive semi - definite matrix and its smallest eigenvalue is zero .",
    "let , the eigenvalues of @xmath2 in ascending order are @xmath4 and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of a graph @xmath6 is defined by the set of all laplacian eigenvalues , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "the elements of a laplacian matrix depend on the relative distances between the corresponding pair of nodes . a state dependent laplacian matrix can be given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the vector containing agents states , @xmath10 is the degree matrix , and @xmath11 is the adjacency matrix .",
    "an weighted state dependent adjacency matrix @xcite elements are given as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the relative distance vector between @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a decreasing function with relative distance magnitude . in accordance with an exponential communication model @xcite , the function @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a large positive constant representing the rate of decay of communication quality over distance .",
    "an inter - agent connection strength decays exponentially within the communication range @xmath19 , and the connection is lost beyond this range .",
    "note that every agent in the network has equal communication range .",
    "the degree matrix @xmath20 is diagonal with elements given as @xmath21    using equation ( [ eqn : dminusa ] ) , the elements of laplacian @xmath22 are expressed as @xmath23 the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath24 of a laplacian @xmath25 is known as the _ _ algebraic connectivity _ _ of the related graph of @xmath1 agents , and the corresponding vector is known as _ the fiedler vector _ @xcite .",
    "this eigenvalue provides a quantitative measure of the global communication strength of a multi - agent system . a multi - agent graph with positive @xmath24 has at least one spanning tree ensuring an information flow path among agents , whereas with null @xmath24 there exists no spanning tree and so the information exchange gets interrupted .",
    "a higher value of @xmath24 indicates more connections among agents , which is useful in cooperative missions like multi - agent tracking @xcite and formation control @xcite for maintaining , improving or controlling time - varying connectivity during the dynamics .",
    "+      the goal of the present work is to explore different multi - agent topologies that have the same connectivity measure as that of a given one . in mathematical words ,",
    "given a multi - agent graph @xmath26 with connectivity measure @xmath27 , we attempt to find out a family of distinct graphs @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , where the index @xmath30 stands for the number of solutions .",
    "+ the following presents various analytical techniques of determining distinct graphs that have the same connectivity .",
    "in this section , we present an elegant way of finding isospectral graphs @xcite which not only have the same algebraic connectivity but also have the entire spectrum same .      distinct graphs with identical spectrum are called isospectral , and so the corresponding laplacian matrices associated with the graphs are isospectral as well . on applying the similarity transformation with appropriate choice of the orthonormal matrix , i.e. @xmath31 where @xmath32 with @xmath33 , generates an isospectral laplacian @xmath34 from a base laplacian @xmath35 .",
    "+    _ proof .",
    "_ it is well known that the similarity transformation @xcite preserves eigenvalues of an original matrix .",
    "obviously , under such transformations applied to a base laplacian matrix @xmath35 , the newly generated matrix @xmath34 possesses the same set of eigenvalues .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is an orthonormal matrix @xcite , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "note that the transformed matrix @xmath34 can be any symmetric positive semi - definite matrix which may not be of laplacian matrix structure . in order to get a distinct laplacian matrix on applying similarity transformation to a base laplacian matrix , we need to search for a special class of orthonormal matrices that not only preserves the eigenvalues of a laplacian matrix but also preserves its properties and structure .    the eigenvector @xmath39 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath40 is along the direction @xmath41 always , due to the fact that every row sum or column sum of a laplacian matrix is zero .",
    "note that the fixed eigenvector @xmath39 always belongs to the null space of the laplacian @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , the transformed laplacian matrix @xmath34 has to meet the following condition .",
    "@xmath43 an obvious solution to equation ( [ eqn : qcond1 ] ) is determined by exploiting the property of a laplacian matrix @xcite , as follows .",
    "@xmath44 the above condition ( [ eqn : qcond2 ] ) leads to the fact that in order to get a distinct laplacian with same eigenvalues from a base laplacian by similarity transform , the class of real orthonormal matrices @xmath45 have to have every row sum or column sum as @xmath46 . @xmath47      an example of such orthogonal matrix @xmath37 is any permutation matrix @xmath48 because it satisfies the condition ( [ eqn : qcond2 ] ) .",
    "the use of permutation matrix @xmath48 @xcite to get a different laplacian from a base laplacian , is described below .",

    "the above example shows that the rearrangement of multiple agents in a group can generate different topologies having the same spectrum .",
    "thus , the reconfiguration of a multi - agent group by permuting agent locations has potential of switching between formations without affecting connectivity , during a cooperative task .",
