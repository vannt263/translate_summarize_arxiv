    "two basic ingredients are necessary : universal and flavor changing nsi . in the original scheme neutrinos were mixed in the leptonic charged current and universality was violated thanks to the effect of mixing with heavy gauge singlet leptons  @xcite .",
    "such resonance would induce strong neutrino flavor conversion both for neutrinos and antineutrinos simultaneously , possibly affecting the neutrino signal of the sn1987a as well as the possibility of having @xmath47process nucleosynthesis .",
    "this was first quantitatively considered within a two - flavor @xmath48 scheme , and bounds on the relevant nsi parameters were obtained using both arguments  @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of the such `` internal '' or `` massless '' resonant conversion mechanism is that it requires the violation of universality , its position being determined only by the matter chemical composition , namely the value of the electron fraction @xmath43 , and not by the density . in view of the experimental upper bounds on the nsi parameters such new resonance can only take place in the inner layers of the supernova , near the neutrinosphere , where @xmath43 takes its minimum values . in this region",

    "different arguments have been used in order to constrain the parameters describing the nsi , namely , the sn1987a signal , the possibility to get successful @xmath47process nucleosynthesis , and the possible enhancement of the energy deposition behind the shock wave to reactivate it .    on the other hand several subsequent articles  @xcite considered the effects of nsi on the neutrino propagation in a three  neutrino mixing scenario for the case @xmath50 , typical for the outer sn envelope . together with the assumption that @xmath51 this prevents the appearance of internal resonances in contrast to previous references .    motivated by supersymmetric theories without r parity , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors considered the effects of small - strength nsi with @xmath49quarks . following the formalism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite they studied the corrections that such nsi would have on the expressions for the survival probabilities in the standard resonances msw - h and msw - l .",
    "a similar analysis was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming z - induced nsi interactions originated by additional heavy neutrinos",
    ". a phenomenological generalization of these results was carried out in ref .",
    "the authors found an analytical compact expression for the survival probabilities in which the main effects of the nsi can be embedded through shifts of the mixing angles @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast to similar expressions found previously these directly apply to all mixing angles , and in the case with earth matter effects .",
    "the main phenomenological consequence was the identification of a degeneracy between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , similar to the analogous `` confusion '' between @xmath53 and the corresponding nsi parameter noted to exist in the context of long - baseline neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "we have now re - considered the general three  neutrino mixing scenario with nsi . in contrast to previous work  @xcite , we have not restricted ourselves to large values of @xmath43 , discussing also small values present in the inner layers . this way our generalized description includes both the possibility of neutrinos having the `` massless '' nsi - induced resonant conversions in the inner layers of the sn envelope  @xcite , as well as the `` outer '' oscillation - induced conversions  @xcite   small enough not to lead to drastic consequences during the core collapse . ] .",
    "in this section we describe the main ingredients of our analysis . our emphasis will be on the use of astrophysically realistic sn matter and @xmath43 profiles , characterizing its density and the matter composition .",
    "their details , in particular their time dependence , are crucial in determining the way the non - standard neutrino interactions affect the propagation of neutrinos in the sn medium .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] in an unpolarized medium the neutrino propagation in matter will be affected by the vector coupling constant of the nsi , @xmath55  . ] . the way the neutral current nsi modifies the neutrino evolution",
    "will be parametrized phenomenologically through the effective low - energy four - fermion operator described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lnsi ] ) .",
    "we also assume @xmath56 , neglecting possible @xmath57 violation in the new interactions .    under these assumptions",
    "the hamiltonian describing the sn neutrino evolution in the presence of nsi can be cast in the following form   @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the kinetic term @xmath60 with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 the three - neutrino lepton mixing matrix  @xcite in the pdg convention  @xcite and with no @xmath57 phases .",
    "the second term of the hamiltonian accounts for the interaction of neutrinos with matter and can be split into two pieces , @xmath63 the first term , @xmath64 describes the standard interaction with matter and can be written as @xmath65 = diag @xmath66 up to one loop corrections due to different masses of the muon and tau leptons  @xcite .",
    "the standard matter potential for neutrinos is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68  ev , the density is given in @xmath69 , and @xmath43 stands for the relative number of electrons with respect to baryons .",
    "for antineutrinos the potential is identical but with the sign changed .",
    "the term in the hamiltonian describing the non - standard neutrino interactions with a fermion @xmath8 can be expressed as , @xmath70 with @xmath71 . for definiteness and motivated by actual models , for example , those with broken r parity supersymmetry we take for @xmath8 the down - type quark .",
    "however , an analogous treatment would apply to the case of nsi on up - type quarks , the existence of nsi with electrons brings no drastic qualitative differences with respect to the pure oscillation case ( see below ) .",
    "therefore the nsi potential can be expressed as follows , @xmath72 from now on we will not explicitely write the superindex @xmath73 . in order to further simplify the problem we will redefine the diagonal nsi parameters so that @xmath74 , as one can easily see that subtracting a matrix proportional to the identity leaves the physics involved in the neutrino oscillation unaffected .",
    "neutrino propagation depends on the supernova matter and chemical profile through the effective potential .",
    "this profile exhibits an important time dependence during the explosion .",
    "[ fig : snprofiles ] shows the density @xmath75 and the electron fraction @xmath76 profiles for the sn progenitor as well as at different times post - bounce .",

    "the electron fraction profile varies depending on the matter composition of the different layers .",
    "for instance , typical values of @xmath43 between 0.42 and 0.45 in the inner regions are found in stellar evolution simulations  @xcite . in the intermediate regions , where the msw @xmath82 and @xmath83-resonances take place @xmath84 .",
    "this value can further increase in the most outer layers of the sn envelope due to the presence of hydrogen .",
    "after the sn core bounce the matter profile is affected in several ways . first note that a front shock wave starts to propagate outwards and",
    "eventually ejects the sn envelope .",
    "the evolution of the shock wave will strongly modify the density profile and therefore the neutrino propagation  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we shall assume that the structure of the shock wave is more complicated and an additional `` reverse wave '' appears due to the collision of the neutrino - driven wind and the slowly moving material behind the forward shock , as seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : snprofiles ]  .    on the other hand , the electron fraction is also affected by the time evolution as the sn explosion proceeds",
    "once the collapse starts the core density grows so that the neutrinos become eventually effectively trapped within the so called `` neutrinosphere '' . at this point",
    "the trapped electron fraction has decreased until values of the order of 0.33  @xcite .",
    "when the inner core reaches the nuclear density it can not contract any further and bounces . as a consequence a shock wave forms in the inner core and starts propagating outwards . when the newly formed supernova shock reaches densities low enough for the initially trapped neutrinos to begin streaming faster than the shock propagates  @xcite , a breakout pulse of @xmath1 is launched . in the shock - heated matter , which is still rich of electrons and",
    "completely disintegrated into free neutrons and protons , a large number of @xmath1 are rapidly produced by electron captures on protons .",
    "they follow the shock on its way out until they are released in a very luminous flash , the breakout burst , at about the moment when the shock penetrates the neutrinosphere and the neutrinos can escape essentially unhindered . as a consequence ,",
    "the lepton number in the layer around the neutrinosphere decreases strongly and the matter neutronizes  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath43 steadily decreases in these layers until values of the order of @xmath85 . outside the neutrinosphere",
    "there is a steep rise until @xmath86 .",
    "this is a robust feature of the neutrino - driven baryonic wind .",
    "neutrino heating drives the wind mass loss and causes @xmath43 to rise within a few @xmath87  km from low to high values , between 0.45 and 0.55  @xcite , see bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : snprofiles ] . inspired in the numerical results of ref .",

    "fig : snprofiles ] one can see how the boundary roughly varies between @xmath99  cm and @xmath100  cm , depending on the time considered .",

    "in contrast to the case of the @xmath82-resonance , where the mixing angle @xmath53 is still unknown , in the case of the @xmath83 transition the angle @xmath52 has been shown by solar and reactor neutrino experiments to be large  @xcite . as a result , for the mass scale @xmath210 this transition will always be adiabatic irrespective of the values of @xmath103 , and will affect only neutrinos .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction one of the major motivations to study nsi using the neutrinos emitted in a sn is the enhancement of the nsi effects on the neutrino propagation through the sn envelope due to the specific extreme matter conditions that characterize it . in this section",
    "we analyze how these effects translate into observable effects in the case of a future galactic sn .",
    "schematically , the neutrino emission by a sn can be divided into four stages : infall phase , neutronization burst , accretion , and kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase . during the infall phase and neutronization",
    "burst only @xmath1 s are emitted , while the bulk of neutrino emission is released in all flavors in the last two phases . whereas the neutrino emission characteristics of the two initial stages are basically independent of the features of the progenitor , such as the core mass or equation of state ( eos ) , the details of the neutrino spectra and luminosity during the accretion and cooling phases may significantly change for different progenitor models . as a result",
    ", a straightforward extraction of oscillation parameters from the bulk of the sn neutrino signal seems hopeless . only features in the detected neutrino spectra which are independent of unknown sn parameters",
    "should be used in such an analysis  @xcite .",
    "the question then arises as to how can one obtain information about the nsi parameters .",
    "taking into account that the main effect of nsi is to generate new internal neutrino flavor transitions , one possibility is to invoke theoretical arguments that involve different aspects of the sn internal dynamics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that such an internal flavor conversion during the first second after the core bounce might play a positive role in the so - called sn shock reheating problem .",
    "it is observed in numerical simulations  @xcite that as the shock wave propagates it loses energy until it gets stalled at a few hundred km .",
    "it is currently believed that after neutrinos escape the sn core they can to some extent deposit energy right behind and help the shock wave continue outwards . on the other hand",
    "it is also believed that due to the composition in matter of the protoneutronstar ( pns ) the mean energies of the different neutrino spectra obey @xmath211 .",
    "this means that a resonant conversion between @xmath212 and @xmath213 between the neutrinosphere and the position of the stalled shock wave would make the @xmath212 spectra harder , and therefore the energy deposition would be larger , giving rise to a shock wave regeneration effect .",
    "another argument used in the literature was the possibility that the @xmath47process nucleosynthesis , responsible for synthesizing about half of the heavy elements with mass number @xmath214 in nature , could occur in the region above the neutrinosphere in sne  @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition is @xmath215 in the nucleosynthesis region .",
    "the value of the electron fraction depends on the neutrino absorption rates , which are determined in turn by the @xmath216 luminosities and energy distribution .",
    "these can be altered by flavor conversion in the inner layers due to the presence of nsi .",
    "therefore by requiring the electron fraction be below 0.5 one can get information about the values of the nsi parameters .    while it is commonly accepted that neutrinos will play a crucial role in both the shock wave re - heating as well as the @xmath47process nucleosynthesis , there are still other astrophysical factors that can affect both . while the issue remains under debate we prefer to stick to arguments directly related to physical observables in a large water cherenkov detector .",
    "there are several possibilities .    * the modulations in the @xmath0 spectra due to the passage of shock waves through the supernova  @xcite * the modulation in the @xmath0 spectra due to the time dependence of the electron fraction , induced by the @xmath93-resonance * the modulations in the @xmath0 spectra due to the earth matter  @xcite * detectability of the neutronization @xmath1 burst  @xcite    three of these observables , 1 , 3 and 4 have already been considered in the literature in the context of neutrino oscillations . here",
    "we discuss the potential of the above promising observables in providing information about the nsi parameters .",
    "it is important to pay attention to the possible ocurrence of the internal @xmath93-resonance and to its effect in the external @xmath82 and @xmath83-resonances .",
    "the first can induce a genuinely new observable effect , item 2 above .    here",
    "we concentrate on neutral current - type non - standard interactions , hence there will be not effect in the main reaction in water cherenkov and scintillator detectors , namely the inverse beta decay , @xmath217   will contribute to the @xmath218 cross section . ] . for definiteness we take nsi with @xmath73 ( down ) quarks , in which case",
    "the nsi effects will be confined to the neutrino evolution inside the sn and the earth , through the vector component of the interaction .    from all possible combinations of nsi parameters we will concentrate on those for which the internal @xmath93 transition does take place , namely @xmath219 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : yei - ei ] . concerning the fc nsi parameters we will consider @xmath220 between @xmath221 and @xmath163 , range in which the @xmath93-resonance is adiabatic , see fig .  [ fig : adiab_i ] .",
    "in the following discussion we will focus on the extreme cases defined in table  [ table : nuschemes ] .",
    "one of the motivations for considering these cases is the fact that the resonances involved become either adiabatic or strongly non adiabatic , and hence the survival probabilities in the absence of earth effects or shock wave passage , become energy independent .",

    "<S> we study the possibility of detecting nsi effects in a megaton water cherenkov detector , either through modulation effects in the @xmath0 spectrum due to ( i ) the passage of shock waves through the sn envelope , ( ii ) the time dependence of the electron fraction and ( iii ) the earth matter effects ; or , finally , through the possible detectability of the neutronization @xmath1 burst . </S>",

    "<S> this occurs for non - universal nsi strengths of a few % , and for very small flavor - changing nsi above a few@xmath2 . </S>"
