    "these are notes for five lectures on moduli and degenerations of algebraic curves via tropical geometry . what do i mean by degenerations of algebraic curves ?",
    "the basic idea is that one can get information about the behavior of a smooth curve by studying one - parameter families of smooth curves , which degenerate in the limit to a singular curve , instead .",
    "the singular curve typically has many irreducible components , giving rise to a rich combinatorial structure .",
    "this technique obviously relies on having a robust notion of family of curves , that is , a moduli space .",
    "thus moduli spaces immediately come to the fore .",
    "tropical geometry is a modern degeneration technique .",
    "you can think of it , to begin with , as a very drastic degeneration in which the limiting object is entirely combinatorial .",
    "we will flesh out this picture over the course of the lectures .",
    "it is also a developing field : exactly _ what _ tropical geometry encompasses is a work in progress , developing rapidly .",
    "the powerful idea of using degenerations to study algebraic curves is at least several decades old and has already been very successful .",
    "but recent developments in tropical geometry make it timely to return to and expand upon these ideas .",
    "the focus of these lectures will be on one beautiful recent meeting point of algebraic and tropical geometry : the _ tropical moduli space of curves _ , its relationship with the deligne - mumford compactification by stable curves , and its implications for the topology of @xmath0 .",
    "i am not assuming any prior background in tropical geometry .",
    "let s start from scratch .",
    "centuries ago , some of the very first objects considered in algebraic geometry were just _ plane curves _ : the zero locus in @xmath1 of a homogeneous equation in three variables .",
    "only later was the perspective of studying curves abstractly , free from a particular embedding in projective space , developed .",
    "we ll do the same , starting with some plane tropical curves , which are a special case of _ embedded tropicalizations .",
    "_      the natural setting for tropical geometry is over _ nonarchimedean fields .",
    "_ let @xmath2 be a field , and write @xmath3 as usual .",
    "a _ nonarchimedean valuation _ on @xmath2 is a map @xmath4 satisfying :    1 .",
    "@xmath5 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath6    for all @xmath7 . by convention",
    "we may extend @xmath8 to @xmath2 by declaring @xmath9 .",
    "the ring @xmath10 of elements with nonnegative valuation is the _ valuation ring _ of @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath10 is a local ring ; write @xmath11 for its residue field .",
    "if you are arithmetically minded , you might immediately think of the @xmath12-adic field @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , the completion of its algebraic closure .",
    "for another example , take your favorite field , perhaps @xmath15 , and equip it with the all - zero valuation , also known as the _",
    "trivial valuation_. this example sounds unimportant , but it is theoretically important , because it permits a unified theory of tropicalization .    another good example to keep in mind is @xmath16 , the field of _ laurent series , _ with valuation @xmath17 . in this example , @xmath2 is discretely valued , in that @xmath18 .",
    "note that the algebraic closure of @xmath19 is the field of _ puiseux series _",
    "@xmath20 , whose elements are power series with bounded - denominator fractional exponents .",
    "this field is a favorite of tropical geometers .",
    "[ ex : mintwice ] let @xmath21 .",

    "suppose @xmath2 is a nonarchimedean field .",
    "if @xmath2 is algebraically closed then its residue field @xmath25 is also algebraically closed .",
    "already , you can get a glimpse of _ why _ tropical geometry is performed over nonarchimedean fields .",
    "for example , a curve @xmath26 over @xmath16 can be regarded as a family of complex curves over an infinitesimal punctured complex disc @xmath27 around @xmath28 .",
    "the eventual _ tropicalization _ of this curve will be a metric graph ( decorated with a little bit of extra stuff ) .",

    "_ along with a fixed identification of the two nodes of @xmath121 with the two edges of @xmath329 _ , we choose ( up to projective equivalence ) four distinct points @xmath344 on a @xmath40 , with the understanding that @xmath345 will be marked 1 , @xmath346 marked 2 , and @xmath347 and @xmath348 will be the two points of attachment of the other rational curve .",
    "of course @xmath349 is an honest variety : for example , fixing @xmath350 and @xmath351 identifies @xmath349 with @xmath352 .",
    "now @xmath322 is then the stack quotient @xmath353 $ ] , where the action is the one that exchanges @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "you can work out that with the identification @xmath354 above , the action sends @xmath355 to @xmath356 .",
    "thus the quotient @xmath322 is a once - punctured plane with a @xmath268-stacky point , corresponding to the fixed point @xmath357 of @xmath349 under @xmath268 .",
    "it is the stacky point that produces monodromy : walking around it interchanges the analytic branches of the boundary divisor that meet along it .",
    "this example is just like example  [ ex : whitney ] , except that the punctured complex plane in that example is now filled in with a @xmath268-stacky point , and there is another ( inconsequential ) puncture elsewhere .",
    "the result is that for a point @xmath12 in @xmath322 , the neighborhood @xmath334 has boundary complex a segment modulo a flip , just as in example  [ ex : whitney ] . and this is indeed a slice of the cell @xmath358 corresponding to @xmath329 in the tropical moduli space @xmath359 .",
    "suppose @xmath231 is a smooth variety over @xmath25 , or even a smooth deligne - mumford stack .",
    "let @xmath360 be a normal crossings compactification of @xmath231 .",
    "it is a fact that the homotopy type of the boundary complex @xmath254 is independent of the choice of compactification @xmath26 ; that is , any other normal crossings compactification produces a homotopy equivalent complex @xcite .",
    "this means that all topological invariants of @xmath254 are actually invariants of @xmath231 itself .",
    "one very interesting such invariant is the _ rational homology _ of @xmath254 .",
    "the reason that it is particularly interesting is as follows .",
    "set @xmath227 .",
    "then there is a _ weight filtration _ , due to deligne , on the cohomology of @xmath231 @xmath361 let s write @xmath362 for the quotient @xmath363 . letting @xmath364 , i ll refer to @xmath365 as the _ top - weight cohomology _ , since cohomology never appears in weights above @xmath366 .",
    "the point is that there is a canonical identification @xmath367 of reduced , rational homology of the boundary complex , up to shifting degrees , with the top - weight rational cohomology of @xmath231 .",
    "these facts all follow from deligne s work on mixed hodge structures @xcite in the case of varieties ; in the case of stacks , they can be proved following deligne s ideas as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) . in short : the top - weight slice of cohomology is combinatorially encoded in the boundary complex of any normal crossings compactification .",
    "the identification  , along with theorem  [ thm : acp ] , allows us to study the rational cohomology of @xmath220 appearing in top weight exactly by studying the reduced rational homology of @xmath209 .",
    "this is a useful shift in perspective , because it allows arguments from tropical geometry and metric graph theory to be employed to study these complexes . along these lines , s.  galatius , s.  payne , and",
    "i have shown some general results on @xmath368 , including a lower bound on the connectivity of those spaces .- connected if the homotopy groups @xmath369 all vanish .",
    "] when @xmath370 , our results allow us to describe the whole situation pretty thoroughly :      1 .",
    "@xmath371 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of @xmath372 top - dimensional spheres , for @xmath373 .",
    "( it is contractible when @xmath374 and @xmath375 . ) therefore : 2 .   for each @xmath376 ,",
    "the top weight cohomology of @xmath377 is @xmath378 moreover , for each @xmath373 , the representation of @xmath379 on @xmath380 induced by permuting marked points can be described explicitly , as in @xcite .",
    "3 .   when @xmath373 , a dual basis for @xmath381 is given by the _ torus classes _ associated to the @xmath372 terminal curves whose dual graph is a loop of @xmath109 once - marked @xmath40s .    i should remark that when @xmath382 , theorem  [ thm : cgp](2 ) also follows in principle from an earlier calculation by e.  getzler @xcite , as we explain in @xcite .",
    "there is also a companion paper for the case @xmath383 @xcite , in which i again use tropical techniques to show vanishing of _ integral _ homology of @xmath384 outside the top two degrees , and compute the top - weight euler characteristic of @xmath385 for every @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , using tropical geometry and _ using a computer _ one can fully compute the top - weight @xmath386-cohomology of @xmath0 in a range of cases , as we discuss in @xcite .",
    "i reproduce the computations for @xmath385 from @xcite for your curiosity : the cohomology is concentrated in degrees @xmath387 and @xmath388 with ranks given in the table below .",
