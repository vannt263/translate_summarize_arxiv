    "this expression diminishes to the massless particles action .",
    "similarly , we can determine the action for the incoming particles either massive or massless .",
    "in this paper , we have used semiclassical wkb approximation to study tunneling continuum of charged fermions from a pair of electrically and magnetically charged accelerating and rotating bhs , together with nut parameter and cosmological constant .",
    "it is found that the tunneling probabilities ( ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 12a ] ) ) of outgoing charged fermions do not depend upon fermion s mass but only its charge .",
    "for the family of bh solutions , the corresponding hawking temperatures ( ( [ new1 ] ) and ( [ newwww ] ) ) depend upon mass , acceleration , rotation parameters and nut parameter as well as electric and magnetic charges of the pair of bhs involving cosmological constant .",
    "equations for the spin - down case are of the identical form as in case of the spin - up particles with the exception of negative sign . for both cases ,",
    "either massive or massless , the hawking temperature indicates that the spin - up and spin - down particles are transmitted at the similar tunneling rate @xcite .",
    "this work is the generalization of our previous work @xcite by adding @xmath1 in the family of bh solutions .",
    "we see from graphs that these solutions lead to expanding bh solutions .",
    "we would like to mention here that the cosmological constant can be positive / negative in general .",
    "however , for the sake of positive temperature , the cosmological constant must be positive for this set of parameters",
    ". we can take negative cosmological constant for some other set of parameters but it is not sure whether it will give temperature positive or negative .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that for the pd family of bh solutions , in the absence of the cosmological constant , all results reduce to the results already given in @xcite .",
    "the graphical representation ( figures * 1 * and * 2 * ) indicates that whether the cosmological constant increases or decreases , it has no effect on the horizon radius @xmath46",
    ". however , the horizon radius always increases ( hence approaches to its maximum value ) whether @xmath11 is decreasing to zero or increasing to zero .",
    "similarly , the horizon radius always decreases ( hence approaches to its minimum value ) whether positive @xmath11 is increasing to @xmath125 or negative @xmath11 is decreasing to @xmath126 . hawking temperature remains positive for this choice of parameters . for @xmath127 ,",
    "the temperature decreases as @xmath11 decreases ( independent of @xmath1 ) . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the temperature increases as @xmath11 decreases . for @xmath129 ,",
    "temperature approaches to its maximum value , while @xmath1 behaves constantly .",
    "we see from figures * 3 * and * 4 * that for increasing @xmath1 , the temperature @xmath103 and radius @xmath47 increase when @xmath127 , while these decrease when @xmath128 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the hawking temperature and horizon radius attain its maximum values with positive increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the graphical behavior of horizons show that @xmath46 is the outer horizon , while @xmath47 is the cosmological horizon . in the tunneling picture",
    ", particles can also tunnel from the cosmological horizon like the event horizon .",
    "the tunneling behavior is different for these two horizons .",
    "the event horizon decreases when + ve - energy particles tunnel across it , while the cosmological horizon expands .",
    "the emitted particles are found to tunnel into the cosmological horizon in the form of radiation @xcite-@xcite .    for de sitter bhs",
    ", particles can be created at event horizon as well as at cosmological horizon . at the event horizon ,",
    "@xmath64ve - energy ( outgoing ) particles tunnel out the bh horizon to form hawking radiation and @xmath66ve - energy ( incoming ) particles can fall into the horizon along classically permitted trajectories . at the cosmological horizon , outgoing particles can fall classically out of the horizon and incoming particles tunnel inside the horizon to form hawking radiation for distant observer .",
    "thus , the tunneling probability of incoming particles through cosmological horizon @xmath47 of pd bhs can be written as @xmath130 } { \\textmd{prob}[\\textmd{out}]}= \\exp[-4\\textmd{im}r_-],\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\exp\\left[\\frac{4\\pi\\left[r_{2+}^2+(a+l)^2\\right]\\left(e-\\omega_hj- \\frac{qer_{2+}}{\\left[r_{2+}^2+(a+l)^2\\right]}\\right)}{\\left(r_{2+}-r_{1+}\\right ) \\left(r_{2+}-r_{1-}\\right)\\left(r_{2+}-r_{2-}\\right)}\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by comparing the above expression with the boltzmann factor , there is only one choice to consider @xmath66ve - energy at cosmological horizon .",
    "thus , in de sitter space massive particles have @xmath66ve - energy which can tunnel inside the cosmological horizon . the hawking temperature at the cosmological horizon of pd bhs by using @xmath66ve - energy particles",
    "can be written as given by eq.([newwww ] ) .",
    "this temperature is same as for the temperature of outgoing particles .",
    "figures * 1 * and * 3 * show that the hawking temperatures at horizon radii @xmath46 and @xmath47 exhibit @xmath64ve behavior .",
    "thus the hawking temperatures ( [ new1 ] ) and ( [ newwww ] ) must be @xmath64ve for outgoing particles through the event horizon and incoming particles through the cosmological horizon .",
    "the graphical behavior of temperature helps to know about the horizon radii of pd bh .",
    "these verifications are consistent with already available in the literature @xcite .    finally , it is pointed out that bhs with nut charge are not consistent with the existence of fermions insofar as such spacetimes do not support spin structures @xcite .",
    "here we have given calculations that surprisingly show good agreement with known results about the hawking temperature in the limits in which they apply .",
    "this agreement is of particular interest even when no spin structure of @xmath58 exists .",
