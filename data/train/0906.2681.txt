    "the investigation of the multiplicity of early - type stars in very young open clusters is a powerful tool to better understand many problems related to massive star research .",
    "first of all , such studies allow us to enlarge the - still rather small - sample of massive stars with well determined fundamental properties such as masses and radii .",
    "moreover , the statistical properties of the binary systems also constrain the formation scenarios of massive stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the region around @xmath1 carinae harbours several very young open clusters and is therefore extremely rich in early - type stars . as a consequence",
    ", this area has been the subject of many investigations over the last thirty years . in this context and in the framework of the so - called _ x - mega _ project @xcite , aiming ( among other things ) at an intensive monitoring of the region around @xmath1 carinae with the _ rosat _ x - ray satellite , a large multi - wavelength observing effort was devoted to the carina nebula and the trumpler 16 cluster in particular .",
    "one of the prime objectives was to obtain accurate ephemerides of colliding - wind early - type binary systems to interpret their x - ray light curves .",
    "the spectroscopic monitoring of these objects started in the late 1990 s and led to a series of papers @xcite reporting the results of dedicated investigations of the properties of a number of o - type binaries in the carina nebula .",
    "this paper is the seventh in this series and is devoted to three objects : the binary systems tr16 - 112 and hd93343 as well as the likely single star hd93250 .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discuss the general properties of o - type binaries in and around trumpler16 as derived in the framework of the present campaign and other related studies .",
    "six medium resolution spectra of tr16 - 112 and of hd93343 in the wavelength range @xmath2  were gathered in 1997 with the eso 1.5 m telescope equipped with a boller & chivens ( b&c ) cassegrain spectrograph ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the instrumentation and the data reduction ) .",
    "several spectra of tr16 - 112 were obtained in 1986 with the cassegrain spectrograph at the ctio 1 m telescope equipped with a two - dimensional , photon - counting detector ( 2d - frutti ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage was from 3800 to 5000  with a 3 pixel resolution of 1.5 .",
    "the s / n ratios were about 50 .",
    "several low - resolution spectra of the same star were obtained in 1993 , 2007 and 2008 at complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) , argentina .",
    "the spectra were taken with the modified reosc sel spectrograph in simple dispersion cassegrain mode attached to the 2.15 m jorge sahade telescope .",
    "the dispersion was 1.64  per pixel .",
    "the data cover the wavelength range from 3800 to 4800  and have a s / n of about 200 .",
    "the spectra were reduced at facultad de ciencias astronmicas y geofsicas ( universidad nacional de la plata ) with the iraf software version 2.10 .",
    "radial velocities of the heii @xmath34542 and @xmath34686 lines were obtained by fitting a gaussian profile to the observed lines .      during several observing campaigns",
    "( may 1999 , may 2000 , may 2001 , march & april 2002 and may 2004 ) , we took a series of echelle spectra of our targets ( 27 for tr16 - 112 , 9 for hd93343 and 6 for hd93250 ) with the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) mounted first on the eso 1.5 m ( until october 2002 ) and later on the eso / mpg 2.2 m telescopes at la silla .",
    "these spectra cover the wavelength domain from about 3750 to 9000  with a resolving power of 48000 .",
    "the detector was an eev ccd with @xmath4 pixels of size @xmath5@xmath6m@xmath7 .",
    "the exposure times were typically 30min and the typical s / n ratios were about 150 .",
    "the data were reduced using the specific context under the midas environment along with an improved reduction pipeline ( see @xcite ) . finally , the feros spectra were normalized to the continuum using polynomials .",
    "high - resolution echelle spectra were also obtained at casleo in 1994 and 2008 with the reosc sel instrument in echelle mode attached to the 2.15 m telescope .",
    "the detector was a tek @xmath8 pixel ccd .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from 3600 to 6000  with a spectral resolving power of 18000 .",
    "typical s / n ratios are about 80 .",
    "the reosc echelle spectra were reduced using iraf routines .",
    "individual echelle orders were normalized using carefully chosen continuum windows .",
    "+      ccd photometry of tr16 - 112 was performed during the nights of february 21 - 27 , 2007 , using the ch-250 camera with a pm512 ccd chip , attached to the 0.6 m helen sawyer hogg telescope ( f/15 cassegrain ) at casleo .",
    "we used a standard johnson - cousins @xmath9 filter set for the observations , although the bulk of the data were taken in the @xmath10 band .",
    "the ccd images were calibrated in the standard way using bias , dark and flat - field frames and finally the photometry was derived using the apphot / iraf package . the typical uncertainty on the differential @xmath10-band photometry of tr16 - 112 is about 0.005mag .",
    "we added up all the feros spectra of our targets in the wavelength domain 3870  3950  to derive high quality spectra of the interstellar hei @xmath33889 and caii k lines .",
    "for all three stars , the profiles of the caii k lines look remarkably similar to the plots given by @xcite .",
    "the high signal to noise ratio of our mean spectra allows us to further detect some weak ( equivalent widths of a few m ) higher velocity components that were not seen in the older data . in the case of tr16 - 112",
    ", we definitely find a component at @xmath11kms@xmath12 and possibly another one at @xmath13kms@xmath12 . in hd93343",
    ", we clearly identify an absorption at @xmath14kms@xmath12 , whilst in hd93250 we detect a component at @xmath15kms@xmath12 .",
    "all three stars display a moderately prominent interstellar hei @xmath33889 absorption line at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath16kms@xmath12 ( for tr16 - 112 and hd93250 ) and @xmath17kms@xmath12 ( hd93343 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of these features are @xmath18 ( hd93343 ) , @xmath19 ( hd93250 ) and @xmath20  ( tr16 - 112 ) .",
    "tr16 - 112 ( @xmath21 cpd@xmath222641 @xmath21 cd@xmath223310 , @xcite ) is a member of the tr16 cluster . based on 10 low - resolution spectra , @xcite classified tr16 - 112 as an sb1 binary system with an orbital period of 4.02days .",
    "their preliminary orbital solution yielded a significant eccentricity of 0.23 .",
    "@xcite subsequently obtained 5 additional rv data points from echelle spectra and re - computed an sb1 orbital solution with a period of 4.080days and @xmath23 .",
    "we have applied a disentangling method based on the principles discussed by @xcite to the normalized feros spectra of tr16 - 112 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have selected two wavelength domains within the spectral range covered by the feros data : our violet and blue domains cover respectively the wavelength intervals [ 4000 , 4250 ] and [ 4410,4790 ] . disentangling the spectra of the components of this star was a challenging task that pushed our code to its limits .",
    "indeed , the secondary star contributes only about 8 percent of the total light of the system making it rather difficult to accurately follow its spectral signature .",
    "the resulting separated spectra are displayed in fig.[disentspec ] .",
    "although the disentangled secondary spectrum is admittedly of poor quality , these spectra reveal some interesting features .",
    "the apparent equivalent widths ( i.e.  with respect to the combined primary + secondary continuum ) of the hei @xmath34471 line as determined from the mean disentangled spectra are @xmath24 and 0.073  for the primary and secondary respectively . for the heii @xmath34542 and @xmath34686 lines ,",
    "the apparent primary s equivalent widths ( ews ) are @xmath25 and 0.426  respectively .",
    "none of the latter lines is seen in the secondary spectrum ( see fig.[disentspec ] ) .",
    "the hei @xmath34471/heii @xmath34542 ew ratio ( @xmath26 , see @xcite and @xcite ) places the primary star at the border between spectral types o5.5 and o6 .",
    "the disentangled primary spectrum reveals a weak , but definite , emission blend of niii @xmath274634 - 41 as well as a comparably strong ciii @xmath274647 - 50 emission and a weak civ @xmath34658 p - cygni profile4654 absorption . ] . the fact that the strength of the ciii @xmath274647 - 50 and niii @xmath274634 - 41 blends are very much comparable would put the primary into the scarce category of of?p stars ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we caution however that the known members of the of?p category exhibit supergiant - like features and often display strong spectroscopic variability ( see @xcite ) . in our data",
    ", we find no evidence for such features in the spectrum of the primary star of tr16 - 112 .",
    "the heii @xmath34686 absorption displays a slightly asymmetric profile with some hints of a weak p - cygni type emission component . some evidence for weak siv @xmath274486",
    ", 4504 emissions is found as well as a very weak siiv @xmath34116 emission , whilst siiv @xmath34089 is clearly seen in absorption .",
    "these features motivate a spectral classification of the primary as o5.5 - 6v((f@xmath0?p ) ) .    using the fourier",
    "transform method ( see @xcite ) , we have determined the projected rotational velocity @xmath28kms@xmath12 from the heii @xmath274200 , 4542 and oiii @xmath35592 lines in the disentangled primary spectrum .",
    "this value is slightly lower than the values previously determined from the composite _ iue _ spectra of the system ( @xmath29 and @xmath30kms@xmath12 , see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "one reason for this difference could be blending effects with the secondary s spectrum in the _ iue _ data , as penny mentioned the possible presence of the secondary signature in the cross - correlation function .",
    "the lack of heii lines in the spectrum of the secondary indicates that this is a b - type star .",
    "the most prominent features in the disentangled secondary spectrum are the hei lines ( @xmath274009 , 4026 , 4121 , 4144 , 4471 , 4713 ) as well as h@xmath31 .",
    "somewhat weaker features are due to the ciii + oii blends at 4070 and 4650 , as well as the siiii @xmath274552 , 4568 , mgii @xmath34481 , nii @xmath34530 and oii @xmath34110 lines .",
    "the presence of a very weak siiv @xmath34089 absorption can not be ruled out .",
    "the relative strength of the lines of the silicon ions and the strength of the mgii line compared to hei @xmath34471 suggest a spectral type b2 ( or slightly earlier ) with an uncertainty of about half a subclass ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the relative strength of the nii @xmath34530 line argues for a v - iii luminosity class ( see the luminosity effects at spectral type b2 in @xcite ) .    to evaluate the brightness ratio between the components of the system , we have compared the equivalent widths of prominent lines as measured in the combined spectrum to the typical ews of presumably single stars of the same spectral type . for the primary",
    ", we used the hei @xmath274026 , 4471 as well as heii @xmath274200 , 4542 lines and we took the typical values of the ews from the paper of @xcite . for the secondary",
    ", our comparison was based on the hei @xmath274026 , 4471 and mgii @xmath34481 lines and the typical values of the ews of b2v stars given by @xcite .",
    "this comparison shows that the secondary contributes about @xmath32 percent of the total light of tr16 - 112 in the blue - violet spectral domain ( i.e.  the brightness ratio secondary / primary amounts to 0.09 ) .",
    "the disentangling code offers the possibility of simultaneously determining the radial velocities ( rvs ) of the binary components . for this purpose",
    ", we used the lines listed in table[mask ] .",
    "c c primary & secondary +   + hei @xmath34026 & hei @xmath34026 + siiv @xmath34089 & + hi @xmath34102 & hi @xmath34102 + heii @xmath34200 & +   + hei @xmath34471 & hei @xmath34471 + mgii @xmath34481 & mgii @xmath34481 + heii @xmath34542 & + & siiii @xmath34553 + & siiii @xmath34568 + & oii @xmath34591 + heii @xmath34686 & + hei @xmath34713 & hei @xmath34713 +      since the spectral signature of the secondary component of tr16 - 112 is rather weak , we started by treating the system as an sb1 binary .",
    "we thus measured the radial velocities ( rvs ) of the primary component by fitting gaussian line profiles to the strongest lines .",
    "it was only on a few feros spectra that we directly noted the presence of the secondary s spectral signature in the hei lines . in the latter cases , we simultaneously fitted two gaussian profiles .",
    "since the secondary is of a significantly later spectral type than the primary , the heii lines were not affected and we thus consider that the radial velocities of the heii lines best reflect the motion of the primary of tr16 - 112 . in this way , we obtained a time series of 48 rv measurements from high - resolution echelle spectra , spanning almost 9 years ( 3259 days ) .",
    "note that the rv dispersion of the diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) at 5780  in the feros spectra of tr16 - 112 , was found to be 2.3kms@xmath12 .",
    "this value can be seen as an estimate of the uncertainty on the rv of a constant spectral line in the spectrum of this star .",
    ".radial velocities of tr16 - 112 as measured on our high - resolution echelle spectra .",
    "the first column yields the date of the observation .",
    "the second column indicates the primary rv as inferred from the direct measurement of the heii lines .",
    "columns 3 and 4 yield the primary and secondary rvs as inferred from the disentangling method .",
    "finally , the last column indicates the instrument that was used for the observation : feros ( f ) or the casleo ( c ) sel echelle spectrograph.[rvs ] [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     using all the available orbital solutions for early - type binary systems in or around trumpler16 , we constructed the period  eccentricity diagram shown in fig.[eporb ] .",
    "this figure confirms our assertion from fig.[hrdtr16 ] that hd93161a must be older and more evolved than the main - sequence stars in the core of tr16 .",
    "in fact , for the latter , significant eccentricities are found for orbital periods as short as @xmath33days , indicating that tidal interactions have not yet had the time to circularize the eccentric orbits .",
    "at least three systems of multiplicity three or higher were found among the early - type binaries in the carina complex . concerning the fraction of systems of higher multiplicity , @xcite found that about 43% of the nearby low - mass ( 0.5 - 1.5m@xmath34 ) spectroscopic binaries with @xmath35days quoted in the eighth catalogue of spectroscopic binaries have indeed a tertiary component .",
    "the third component provides a natural sink for the angular momentum that needs to be removed from a binary system in order to make it a close one .",
    "@xcite quotes an empirical stability limit for a triple system : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond respectively to the orbital period of the close binary , the orbital period of the third star around the centre of mass of the close binary and the eccentricity of the third star s orbit .",
    "both possible orbital solutions for the third component in tr16 - 104 largely satisfy this criterion , whilst the orbital period of the sb1 component in tr16 - 110 assumed to correspond to @xmath38 of a triple system obviously can not meet this condition , thus confirming the idea that there should exist a fourth ( unseen ) component in this system .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the very first sb2 orbital solution of the tr16 - 112 binary system .",
    "we derived a rather large mass ratio and confirmed that this binary has an orbit with a significant eccentricity despite of its short orbital period .",
    "this system displays ellipsoidal variations that can be explained by the primary filling about 73% of its roche lobe at periastron .",
    "furthermore , we have presented the first clear evidence for an sb2 signature in the spectrum of hd93343 .",
    "this system likely harbours one fast and one slow rotator and could currently be a post - roche lobe overflow evolutionary stage , making it a somewhat less extreme version of plaskett s star .",
    "finally , we have shown that the properties of the components of most of the binaries in the carina region ( in or around trumpler16 ) suggest that these are very young objects where tidal interactions have not yet had the time to circularize the orbits .",
    "one point that remains to be studied in the forthcoming years is the lack of a clear binary signature in hd93250 .",
    "this system displays a non - thermal radio emission and such a phenomenon is a priori not expected for a single star .",
    "interferometric observations could help to search for a companion that might be either too faint or too far away from the o3.5 primary to be detected in spectroscopy .",

    "<S> we present the results of a spectroscopic monitoring campaign devoted to three o - type stars in the carina nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the full sb2 orbital solution of the binary system tr16 - 112 , an exceptional dissymmetrical system consisting of an o5.5 - 6v((f@xmath0?p ) ) primary and a b2v - iii secondary . </S>",
    "<S> we also report on low - amplitude brightness variations in tr16 - 112 that are likely due to the ellipsoidal shape of the o5.5 - 6 primary revolving in an eccentric orbit around the system s centre of mass . </S>",
    "<S> we detect for the first time a clear sb2 binary signature in the spectrum of hd93343 ( o8 + o8 ) , although our data are not sufficient to establish an orbital solution . </S>",
    "<S> this system also displays low amplitude photometric modulations . on the other hand , no indication of multiplicity </S>",

    "<S> finally , we discuss the general properties of multiple massive stars in the carina ob1 association .    </S>",
