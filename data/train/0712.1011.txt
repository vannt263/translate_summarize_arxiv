    "<S> we consider a gauge extension of the electroweak sector of the standard model based on the group g@xmath0su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exceptional group g@xmath2 is the smallest rank two group that contains su(3 ) as a subgroup ; the su(3 ) prediction @xmath3 follows approximately in this model if the couplings of the additional su(2 ) and u(1 ) factors are sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> we study the symmetry breaking sector of the model , the bounds from precision electroweak constraints and the mass spectrum of exotic gauge bosons that may be produced at future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss an su(3 ) electroweak model in which a vector - like sector is included explicitly to facilitate the decays of otherwise stable exotic states . </S>",
    "<S> the models considered here represent plausible extensions of the minimal su(3 ) electroweak model with potentially distinctive tev - scale phenomenology . </S>"
