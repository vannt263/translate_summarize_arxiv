    "even when a will exists , disputes arise . designated estate agents are often employed to resolve bequest related problems .",
    "a wall street journal article quotes an expert suggesting the following dispute resolution procedure :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in family disputes , ms .",

    "a key feature of these problems is that transfers can be used ( either as taxes or subsidies ) for resource allocation .",
    "however , transfers across agents have to balance - money raised by auctioning a bequest must be redistributed among the heirs .",
    "we design mechanisms for such problems with the aim of achieving efficiency .",
    "efficiency requires one to allocate the bequest to the highest valued heir or to allocate the world cup venue to the country which benifits the most from hosting the event . in the standard private values model , where each agent has a value for the unit of resource / object and transfers are allowed with quasilinear utility , the vickrey auction satisfies three compelling desiderata of a mechanism : ( a ) dominant strategy incentive compatibility ( dsic ) , ( b ) ( allocative ) efficiency - allocating the object to the highest valuation agent , and ( c ) ex - post individual rationality .",
    "a well - known criticism of the vickrey auction is that it is not budget - balanced - it collects revenue from the agents , which distorts ex - post efficiency .",
    "green79 shows that this criticism applies to every dsic and efficient mechanism : no dsic and efficient mechanism can be budget - balanced .",
    "we look for a second - best solution , where we explore the limits of this impossibility result :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ how close to efficiency can we get using a dsic and budget - balanced mechanism ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we require our solution to satisfy symmetry - agents with identical valuation must get the object with equal probability and pay the same amount . symmetry is a compelling fairness property - for instance , in the bequest allocation problem , an asymmetric mechanism may either be unacceptable to potential heirs or lead to unpleasant lawsuits later on .",
    "we identify a class of dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric mechanisms that we call _ ranking mechanisms_. a ranking mechanism is one that uses a _ ranking _ allocation rule , which is specified ( for @xmath0 agents ) by @xmath0 numbers @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that they add up to not more than @xmath3 and @xmath4 for each @xmath5 . for every @xmath5 , the number @xmath6 is the probability with which an agent with the @xmath5-th highest value is allocated the object at any generic profile of values .",
    "our main result is a description of the _ r - optimal _ mechanism - a dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric ranking mechanism that beats every such mechanism in terms of the allocation probability to the highest valuation agent .    at every profile of values , our r - optimal mechanism allocates the object to the highest valued agent with more than 99% probability , provided",
    "there are at least 14 agents .",
    "it is also ex - post individually rational .",
    "the welfare generated by the r - optimal mechanism converges to efficiency as the number of agents increase .",
    "the nature of convergence is shown in table [ tab : eff ] , where we report on the probability with which the highest valued agent gets the object in our mechanism .",
    ".convergence in our mechanism [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the r - optimal mechanism we identify satisfies ex - post individual rationality .",
    "ex - post individual rationality is a desired property of mechanisms . consider politicians across municipalities or countries , involved in procuring a public facility or negotiating the venue of an international sporting event .",
    "failure to get the facility or the event would result in criticisms . the criticism would be compounded if in addition to a failure , payments also have to be made .",
    "political opponents could well allege corruption .",
    "ranking mechanisms contain two familiar dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric mechanisms : ( i ) the mechanism that allocates the object to each agent with equal probability without using any transfers and ( ii ) the _ residual claimant _ mechanism in @xcite .",
    "the residual claimant mechanism is defined by choosing an agent uniformly at random as a residual claimant and conducting a vickrey auction among the other agents .",
    "the revenue generated from the auction is then given to the residual claimant .",
    "we refer to this mechanism as the green - laffont ( gl ) mechanism , and note that at profiles of distinct values , it allocates the object to the highest valued agent with probability @xmath7 and to the second highest valued agent with probability @xmath8 .",
    "our r - optimal mechanism coincides with the gl mechanism if the number of agents is no more than @xmath9 but differs from it significantly for more than @xmath9 agents .",
    "our analysis is prior - free .",
    "we use dsic as our solution concept . as we discuss later in section [ sec : lit ] , @xcite show that bayesian incentive compatible , efficient , and budget - balanced mechanisms satisfying a form of individual rationality exists in our model . while the mechanism they propose require information about beliefs of agents ( with common prior assumption ) , our result shows the level of efficiency that can be achieved using dsic and budget - balanced mechanisms , thus showing the limits of such a prior - free and robust approach in this problem .",
    "inspired by the seminal work of @xcite , recent literature in mechanism design has been investigating such questions in other models  @xcite .     in view of the green and laffont impossibility result , comparing efficiency levels of two dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric mechanisms is a natural question .",
    "the notion we use here compares ranking mechanisms by the probability with which the highest valued agent gets the object .",
    "formally , we show that this notion coincides with a _ worst - case _ measure of efficiency : the worst - case ratio of welfare generated by a ranking mechanism and efficient level of welfare . in a prior - free environment ,",
    "such worst - case measures give a very robust method of comparing mechanisms .",
    "these measures are widely used to compare algorithms in the computer science literature , and in the algorithmic game theory literature  @xcite .",
    "they are also becoming popular in the mechanism design literature  @xcite .    from a technical point ,",
    "our paper extends the myersonian approach . recall that @xcite provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a mechanism to be dsic .",
    "we extend his characterization to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a mechanism to be dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric .",
    "one of the surprising corollaries of this characterization is that if there is a dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric mechanism using an allocation rule , then it is the only such mechanism using this allocation rule .",
    "a consequence of this result is that the search over the domain of dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric mechanisms can be confined to the domain of allocation rules satisfying our necessary and sufficient conditions - we do not have to worry about payments since they are identified uniquely .",
    "our characterization reveals a rich but complex class of such mechanisms .",
    "the ranking mechanisms that we consider in this paper are much simpler to describe .",
    "the separation of payment and allocation decisions gives us a lot of tractability in the class of ranking allocation rules , where we derive our mechanism and show its constrained optimality .",
    "though we do not know if we can improve upon our r - optimal mechanism , by considering more complex mechanisms , the overwhelming speed of convergence of our mechanism ( as shown in table [ tab : eff ] ) implies that we may not be losing out much by restricting attention to ranking mechanisms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our model in section [ sec : mod ] .",
    "we introduce ranking mechanisms and discuss our main results in section [ sec : rank ] .",
    "we give a technical characterization of dsic , budget - balanced , and symmetric mechanisms in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "we relate our results to the literature in section [ sec : lit ] and conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "all the omitted proofs are relegated to an appendix at the end . to keep the proofs of our results lucid , we present them in a different sequence than the sequence in which corresponding results appear in the main text .",
    "hence , we recommend that the proofs be read after reading the main text .",

    "this is clearly maximized by assigning the object to the highest valued agents .",
    "@xcite show that no dsic and budget - balanced mechanism can be efficient .",
    "hence , a satisfactory mechanism can not be efficient .",
    "the precise question we are interested in is : _ what is the  most \" efficient satisfactory mechanism ? _      in view of the green - laffont result , we adopt one of the well - known notions to measure efficiency of satisfactory mechanisms . fix a satisfactory mechanism @xmath49 .",
    "note that at any valuation profile @xmath26 with @xmath50 , the maximum possible ( efficient ) social welfare is @xmath51 , and the social welfare achieved by @xmath52 is @xmath53 the ratio of these two numbers is a good measure of efficiency at the valuation profile @xmath26 .",

    "we assume @xmath55 .",
    "note that such a measure _ only _ depends on @xmath39 and not on @xmath40 because @xmath31 is a budget - balanced mechanism .",
    "now , the _ worst - case _ of this ratio happens when we minimize this over all @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , for a satisfactory mechanism @xmath49 , the worst - case efficiency is given by    @xmath56.\\ ] ]    a natural objective is to find a satisfactory mechanism that maximizes this worst - case efficiency . as discussed in the introduction , this is a robust method of comparing efficiency of mechanisms .",
    "we apply this notion of comparing efficiency levels of mechanisms in a restricted class of mechanisms that we describe next .",
    "in most of the paper , we focus attention on the following class of simple allocation rules and the corresponding satisfactory mechanisms that can be constructed using such allocation rules .",
    "we call them _ ranking _ allocation rules .",
    "each ranking allocation rule is defined by @xmath0 numbers @xmath57 with each @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 .",
    "informally , at a generic valuation profile @xmath60 , for every @xmath42 , @xmath61 reflects the probability with which agent @xmath42 ( which has rank @xmath42 at this profile ) gets the object .",
    "notice that this probability does not change across valuation profiles as long as the rank of the agent does not change .",
    "this feature makes the ranking allocation rules simple , both from the point of view of practical implementation and analysis . also , we require every ranking allocation rule to be symmetric , and this means that it allocates the object in a particular way when there are ties in valuations .",
    "we clarify this tie - breaking by formally defining the ranking allocation rule first .",

    "consider a ranking allocation rule @xmath67 . according to the definition , agents @xmath3 and @xmath68 will equally share ( due to symmetry ) the allocation probabilities @xmath69 , i.e. , each agent gets the good with probability @xmath70 .",
    "then , agents @xmath71 and @xmath72 will equally share the allocation probabilities @xmath73 .",
    "finally , agents @xmath74 and @xmath75 get allocation probabilities @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .    note that breaking ties in this manner in a ranking allocation rule maintains continuity of total welfare in terms of valuations of agents .",
    "for instance , consider the valuation profile discussed in the above example . consider any arbitrarily close _",
    "( with distinct valuations for agents ) valuation profile to this valuation profile .",
    "the total expected value of agents @xmath3 and @xmath68 in this profile is arbitrarily close to @xmath78 , where the equality follows from the fact that @xmath79 .",
    "hence , we can maintain continuity of total welfare by giving a total of @xmath69 probability to agents @xmath3 and @xmath68 . finally ,",
    "using symmetry , we equally divide this probability among these two agents .",
    "this explains the tie - breaking in the ranking allocation rule .    even though the ranking allocation rule is a simple class of allocation rules ,",
    "there is a rich subclass of ranking allocation rules that are satisfactorily implementable .",
    "our focus on this class is purely driven by their tractability and simplicity .",
    "two well - known ranking allocation rules are satisfactorily implementable .",
    "the equal - sharing allocation rule , where each agent gets the object with probability @xmath80 is satisfactorily implementable - no transfers are required for this .",
    "the other allocation rule comes from a mechanism proposed by green and laffont .",
    "pick an agent @xmath25 uniformly at random .",
    "run a vickrey auction among the remaining @xmath81 agents . give the revenue from the vickrey auction",
    "to agent @xmath25 . since agents are treated symmetrically , the vickrey auction is dsic , and by construction , the mechanism is budget - balanced",
    ".     a closer look at the green - laffont mechanism reveals the following . for valuation profiles with a distinct highest valued agent",
    ", it allocates the object to him with probability @xmath82 and shares the remaining probability @xmath8 among the second highest valued agents . for valuation profiles with more than one highest valued agents , it allocates the entire object equally among the highest valued agents .",
    "therefore , given definition [ def : rank ] , the allocation rule used in the green - laffont mechanism is a ranking allocation rule , where @xmath83 to be precise , this is the allocation rule corresponding to the direct mechanism of the green - laffont mechanism .",
    "we now characterize the ranking allocation rules that can be satisfactorily implemented .",
    "* notation : * for any two non - negative numbers @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 , we denote by @xmath87 the number of ways we can choose @xmath85 agents from a set of @xmath84 agents .    [",
    "prop : rank ] a ranking allocation rule with probabilities @xmath57 is satisfactorily implementable if and only if @xmath88    later , in theorem [ theo : char ] , we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a general allocation rule @xmath39 to be satisfactorily implementable .",
    "those necessary and sufficient conditions are complicated - they involve verifying an infinite system of equations . on the other hand ,",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for satisfactorily implementing a ranking allocation rule is a single equation given by proposition prop : rank .",
    "this hints that it may be tractable to search over the space of ranking allocation rules .",
    "now , we adapt our notion of efficiency measure by restricting the class of mechanisms to ranking mechanisms .",
    "a ranking allocation rule @xmath57 is * r - optimal * if it satisfactorily implementable and for any other satisfactorily implementable ranking allocation rule @xmath89 , we have @xmath90    a ranking mechanism @xmath31 is r - optimal if ( i ) @xmath31 is a satisfactory mechanism and ( ii ) @xmath39 is r - optimal .",

    "later , in theorem [ theo : char ] , we shall establish the fact that if @xmath39 is satisfactorily implementable , then there is a unique @xmath40 such that @xmath31 is a satisfactory mechanism . as a result ,",
    "we shall only talk about the r - optimality of an allocation rule - the corresponding r - optimal mechanisms are uniquely defined .      in this section ,",
    "we provide our main result , which identifies an r - optimal allocation rule .",
    "to do so , we first propose a general class of ranking allocation rules . in this generalization , at a generic valuation profile , the top ranked agent is given the object with some probability @xmath94 and agents ranked @xmath68 to @xmath95 are given the object with equal probability @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",

    "we are now ready to state the main result of the paper .",
    "it shows that there is a two - step ranking allocation rule that is r - optimal , which has excellent convergence to efficiency .",
    "[ theo : nrgl ] there is a two - step ranking allocation rule that is r - optimal .",

    "* remark 2 . *",
    "all our optimality results rely on the fact that the valuation space @xmath109 of each agent is _ rich _ - an interval with zero as the lowest valuation .",
    "we do not know how to extend these results to a setting where @xmath109 is an arbitrary interval .",
    "however , we stress here that the mechanism we derive in theorem [ theo : nrgl ] remains valid for any arbitrary interval @xmath109 . to see this , consider @xmath110 $ ] , where @xmath111 .",
    "note that our results along with the mechanism in theorem [ theo : nrgl ] hold true if valuation space is @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "now , consider the restriction of this mechanism to the valuation space @xmath113 $ ] - such a restriction is well - defined and satisfactory .",
    "thus , our mechanism will have the same efficiency properties when @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "of course , this mechanism need not satisfy the optimality property claimed in theorem [ theo : nrgl ] - though , we have no counter - examples to show this .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that our mechanism will remain optimal even in such type spaces .      besides the optimality of the two - step allocation rule identified in theorem [ theo : nrgl ] , we want to stress the speed with which it converges to efficiency . because of combinatorial terms in the denominator of the expression for @xmath114 , its convergence to @xmath3 is exponential .",
    "we spell out the exact nature of this convergence below .    the exact form of the r - optimal allocation rule will depend on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath95 is determined by minimizing the following expression over all even @xmath115 : @xmath116 routine calculations show that the minimum of this expression occurs when @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "hence , for @xmath118 , the gl allocation rule is the unique r - optimal allocation rule .    if @xmath119 , the minimum of this expression occurs at @xmath117 or @xmath120 .",
