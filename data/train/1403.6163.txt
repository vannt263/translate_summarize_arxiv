    "the moving contact line problem is explained as follows : the theory of traditional macroscopic fluid mechanics imposes the requirement that the velocity of a fluid in contact with a solid substrate must be equal to the velocity of the substrate ( the ` no slip condition ' ) .",
    "however , this condition is obviously violated at a moving contact line , such as what occurs for a spreading droplet . in order to resolve this difficulty ,",
    "the no - slip condition can be changed to an alternative condition that allows for slip .",
    "the challenge in resolving the moving contact line problem is to : ( i ) better understand the current slip models , their advantages and disadvantages ; and ( ii ) propose alternative slip models that better represent the physics . in this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the former problem , and in particular , we discuss the distinguished nature of the zero - slip limit .    here , we shall deal exclusively with the case that the contact line dynamics are modeled using the classic navier slip condition . in two dimensions , where @xmath5 is the velocity parallel to the plane surface , and @xmath6 is measured normally away from it , this condition imposes @xmath7    for a fluid in contact with a solid boundary at rest , and @xmath0 is the slip coefficient , which is a measure of the length over which slip is significant .",
    "there are a multitude of papers in the literature on the asymptotics of the contact line problem as the slip parameter tends to zero ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , and our paper seeks to highlight the idea of the non - uniformity of the perturbation methods as slip tends to zero and for different choices of time scales .",
    "this is most similar to the study of @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we provide a more comprehensive listing of the vast literature on the topic of the moving contact line in  [ literature ] .",
    "more specifically , in this work , we wish to demonstrate that when time is held at @xmath8 , the dynamics of contact line spreading converges to a slipless equation as @xmath3 .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath4 , a re - scaling of time is necessary .",
    "thus , convergence _ can _ be achieved in the zero slip limit by using a slip - free equation , but only at finite time .",
    "our analysis seeks to explore this idea of non - uniformity using a combination of asymptotic techniques , and also accurate numerical results which clearly show the expected limiting behaviours in the singular regime .",
    "we present an asymptotic analysis of the lubrication equations for a droplet spreading under the effect of surface tension .",
    "in particular , there are two regimes :    @xmath9    we find that in regime ( i ) , contact line slippage is ( almost ) a ` regular ' perturbative effect  that is to say , as @xmath3 , the macroscopic motion of the droplet converges to the slip - less equation ( @xmath10 ) , and the apparent contact angle , @xmath11 converges to a value which can be determined solely from solving this particular equation .",
    "the apparent contact angle is not influenced by the microscopic conditions . in this regime",
    ", the contact line displacement tends to zero as slip tends to zero , and any contact line slippage is a higher - order effect within the macroscopic region . note that slippage remains a leading - order contribution within the inner region near the contact line .",
    "however , in the distinguished limit which involves the dual limit @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the solutions in region ( i ) are no longer valid , and the asymptotic approximations in this regime become disordered . a re - scaling of time is necessary ; once time is re - scaled , we recover the equivalent analyses of others [ _ c.f .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ] , and contact line displacement becomes a significant effect .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 is now a function of the unknown contact line location and depends on the microscopic properties of the substrate .",
    "as is well known through these previous works , the contact line speed is logarithmically small in the slip number , and involves the key quantity @xmath12     as a function of time for a spreading droplet released far from its quasi - static state .",
    "( dashed ) the classical quasi - static prediction of contact line speed via and is only valid for large times ( as the slip , @xmath3 ) .",
    "( dashed markers ) for @xmath1 , the slip - free formulation using and provides a better fit .",
    "numerical computations are for the initial profile and @xmath13 .",
    "the details of this image are discussed in  [ hocking ] .",
    "[ bigpic ] ]    the principle result of this paper is shown in figure [ bigpic ] , which plots a re - scaled contact line velocity , @xmath14 , as a function of time for a spreading droplet .",
    "the graph demonstrates that the contact line moves rapidly initially , then slows as time increases .",
    "the two time scales determining the dynamics are clearly visible , and the asymptotic approximations developed in the paper are shown as determining the contact line movement in each respective region .",
    "this notion of multiple scalings of time influencing the resultant contact line asymptotics allows us to better understand the nature of the zero slip limit .",
    "for example , we seek to better understand the early work by @xcite , who studied the quasi - static @xcite of the moving contact line , and sought to understand the relationship between the slip coefficient and the necessary finite difference grid - spacing to achieve convergent results .",
    "they explained that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  converged finite results , if slip is ignored , can never be obtained .",

    "we shall begin in  [ literature ] by briefly reviewing the literature behind theories on the moving contact line , with particular emphasis on the classic macroscopic models , molecular models , and mesoscopic models .",
    "the discussion in this paper will focus on the simplest case of a thin , spreading droplet , and the mathematical formulation is presented in  [ mathform ] .",
    "we analyze the @xmath1 problem in  [ outer ] to [ matching ] , and relate this to the classical analyses of , for example , workers such as @xcite in  [ hocking ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in ",
    "[ discuss ] , focusing on the topic of the role of distinguished limits in more complicated systems involving contact lines .",
    "it would be misleading for us to proceed without fully acknowledging the great body of literature that already exists on the moving contact line problem .",
    "theoretical models of moving contact lines can be roughly divided into three categories : ( i ) molecular kinetic models , ( ii ) molecular dynamic models , and ( iii ) hydrodynamic models .",
    "a sampling of reference works , separated by these three classifications , is given in table [ tab : res ] .",
    "the molecular kinetics model of contact lines was first proposed by @xcite , and later extended by @xcite and @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the dynamics of the contact line is described by an absorption and desorption process of the fluid molecules on the solid surface .",
    "the theory provides a quantitative description for the contact line friction at the microscopic scale , and gives a link between microscopic quantities , such as the frequency and length of molecular displacements , with the macroscopic behaviour of the dynamic contact angle .",
    "the search to better understand microscopic details of contact lines leads naturally to the idea of using molecular dynamics , and studies in this vein include the works by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the approach has been very successful and computations have revealed much in regards to the physical processes near the contact line .",
    "the disadvantage , however , is that such simulations are limited to systems of small scale and within small temporal intervals . as such",
    ", it remains difficult to relate molecular dynamics to the macroscopic scale .",
    "lastly , moving contact lines can be studied using hydrodynamic models , and this includes the classical works of , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and the recent work @xcite .",
    "such models will impose slip through a boundary condition on the macroscopic variables , and thus assumes the specification of an effective condition for the underlying microscopic mechanisms [ _ e.g. _ the navier slip condition of ] .",
    "the primary advantage of such approaches is that the usual governing equations ( _ e.g. _ navier - stokes ) is used with little modification , except for a replacement of the no - slip condition .    as a middle - ground between the molecular and classical macroscopic approaches ,",
    "it is also possible to incorporate intermolecular forces and more detailed physics of the finite - width fluid interface into the hydrodynamics .",
    "such mesoscopic continuum models include the diffuse interface models studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , as well as the work by @xcite and @xcite , where interface creation and destruction processes are modeled .",

    "we shall consider the symmetrical spreading of a thin viscous droplet of height @xmath15 , over a flat surface , where the slip on the surface is governed by the navier slip law .",

    "no microscopic properties are necessary in determining the contact line dynamics at this order .    however , in the limit that @xmath4 , significant contact - line movement occurs , and the asymptotic relations used to derive ( i ) are invalid",
    ". contact line movement can be brought - in by re - scaling time .",
    "thus , in the case of ( ii ) , where time is logarithmically large in the slip number , then the apparent angle is no longer a directly known value .",
    "it can only be computed once the droplet location , @xmath138 , is known , and this value must be found by solving an ordinary differential equation for the position , given by ( [ ode_a ] ) .",
    "although the methodology which we have used to study the @xmath1 problem is very similar to the methodology as used in the classic quasi - static works of , for example , @xcite , the principle motivation of our work is to highlight this idea of the non - uniformity within the time variable .    although the principal setting of our work was for the lubrication equations of thin film flow , the same ideas hold for slow viscous stokes flow .",
    "the difficulty , however , is that even the simplest free - surface problems in stokes flow are too unwieldy to solve , and so classical works on contact line dynamics in slow flow ( _ e.g. _ in @xcite ) have relied upon very general description of how the inner , intermediate , and outer asymptotics are performed . moreover ,",
    "we believe that other contact line models ( _ e.g. _ in table [ tab : res ] ) will exhibit the same subtleties in their asymptotic analysis ; the notion of a distinguished limit in time is a generic aspect that arises due to the separation of macroscopic and microscopic time scales .    in a general problem , there may be multiple choices for the velocity scale and the resultant capillary number .",
    "consider a system that begins at @xmath148 with an imposed ( macroscopic ) velocity scale of @xmath149 ( for example , this may correspond to forced flow through a channel with speed @xmath149 ) . in this case , this initial macroscopic velocity sets the capillary number , @xmath150 the leading - order contact line condition to impose on the outer flow is that the contact line is fixed . to an observer positioned away from the contact line ,",
    "the contact line seems stationary , with surrounding bulk fluid moving at an @xmath8 velocity .",
    "this is emphasized by the analysis of the @xmath1 scaling of  [ outer ] for the case of lubrication theory , and where @xmath149 corresponds to the initial relaxation speed of a droplet deposited far from its quasi - static state .",
    "however , at large times , the bulk fluid slows down from its initial relaxation velocity and is now moving at the same rate as the contact line .",
    "the macroscopic flow is now governed by a smaller capillary number : @xmath151 where @xmath77 is the contact line velocity . relative to this velocity scale , the inner limit of the outer velocity field must now take into account contact line movement .",
    "it can be seen by examining the slow flow equations and free - surface conditions that in the limit @xmath152 , the fluid interface is flat to leading order .",
    "in essence , this justifies the assumptions found in the slow - flow contact line analysis of @xcite where the leading - order outer solution consisted of flow in a fixed wedge for small capillary number flow .",

    ". however , in a localized region near the contact line , the flow is increasingly quasi - static as @xmath4 , and the governing capillary number @xmath163 tends to zero as the slip is taken to zero .",
    "the size of this quasi - static region grows as time increases , and a contact line analysis would require matching the solution near the bath with solution near the contact line , through an intermediate time - dependent region whose length is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "compare and contrast this with the situation of a spreading droplet , where in the limit @xmath4 , the leading order solution is globally solved by the quasi - static solution with constant curvature .",
    "the time - dependent drag - out problem has been studied by , for example , @xcite , and there , it was shown that the analysis is complicated further by the possibility of multiple solutions at large times .",
    "a similar system was studied in the work of @xcite , where they demonstrated that for such problems , there exists an infinite number of zones , logarithmically spaced apart , where the fluid height oscillates between maximums and minimums .",
    "the key aspect of such problems is that , because the solution is only quasi - static near the very tip , an asymptotic analysis of the sort we have done here for @xmath1 , is made difficult due to the required patching of multiple regions changing in time .",
    "indeed , problems such as the case of gravity - driven draining down a vertical wall may not possess a well - defined limit as @xmath3 and @xmath1 , which is evident in the overturning profiles of @xcite .",
    "for such problems , not only is one required to contend with distinguished limits in time , as we have done in this paper , but also distinguished limits between the two ( or more ) capillary numbers . such problems with more complicated global structure is the subject of ongoing investigation .    _",

    "because this involves the numerical solution of ( [ innerperfect ] ) , we have chosen to only present the details for the case of partial wetting ; however , it should be clear that the main point of this paper ( that of understanding the important of time re - scaling ) continues to hold true , even for the case of complete wetting ."
