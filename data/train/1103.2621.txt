    "the aim of the present paper is to implement the method of _ quantum trajectories _ , known as _ de broglie - bohm _ theory @xcite in the phenomenon of the diffraction of charged particles by thin material targets .",
    "in the de broglie - bohm theory we consider trajectories tracing the quantum currents .",
    "a trajectory is determined by the initial particle s position and by the pilot wave equation of motion @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the wavefunction ( ` pilot wave ' ) , @xmath4 is the particle mass and @xmath5 is planck s constant .",
    "this equation implies newton s equation of motion in a potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ` quantum potential ' , an extra term caused by the wavefunction @xmath3 : @xmath8 the probability density of an ensemble of particles guided by the same @xmath3 - field is @xmath9 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ sch2 ] ) imply the continuity equation for @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , in the one - particle case , the bohmian trajectories are equivalent to the stream lines defined by the quantum probability current @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the bohmian method yields practically equivalent results to madelung s quantum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "bohm s trajectories have been proved useful in i ) constructing efficient numerical schemes for the integration of schrdinger s equation via swarms of trajectories ( e.g. @xcite ) , and ii ) visualizing processes for which no other intuitive picture could be obtained .",
    "examples of the latter are the quantum tunneling effect @xcite , the ( particle ) two - slit experiment@xcite , ballistic transport through ` quantum wires ' @xcite , molecular dynamics @xcite , dynamics in nonlinear systems with classical focal points or caustics @xcite and rotational or atom - surface scattering @xcite .",
    "a final application regards the relation of chaotic quantum motions to the dynamical origin of ` quantum relaxation ' @xcite , namely the justification of the approach ( as time increases ) of a quantum system to born s rule @xmath12 , even if the initial conditions were allowed to deviate from this rule ( @xmath13 ) .    in the case of the diffraction of charged particles , we find some new phenomena due to the structure of quantum currents and to their effects on quantum trajectories . in particular , we find that the quantum flow is always characterized by the formation of an array of _ quantum vortices _ delineated along a locus called _ separator _ , i.e. a sharp boundary between the domains of prevalence of the ingoing and outgoing flow .",
    "the local current structure in a vortex forms a pattern called ` nodal point - x - point complex ' .",
    "this has been previously investigated theoretically in @xcite .",
    "here we adapt this analysis in the particular problem of particle diffraction , in order to determine the number and location of all critical points of the quantum flow , as well as to determine the size of the nodal point - x - point complexes .",
    "the main result of this analysis is that the deflection of quantum trajectories is due to their approaches close to x - points .",
    "in fact , the trajectories follow the directions of the asymptotic manifolds of the x - points , and this fact alone suffices to explain the emergence of the whole diffraction pattern .",
    "distance away from the principal beam axis ( z - axis ) .",
    "the thick dashed curves illustrate the separator between ingoing and outgoing ( from the target ) flow .",
    "the concentration of the quantum trajectories to various bragg angles is shown in figure [ orbits ] below .",
    "( b ) same as in ( a ) but in the approximation of classical rutherford scattering for repelling (  ) , or attracting ( @xmath14 ) forces . ]",
    "passing to a global description of the quantum trajectories , we identify a number of important differences between bohmian and classical trajectories , which are summarized with the help of a schematic representation ( figure [ trjsch2 ] ) .",
    "four main differences are : + a ) in the case of quantum trajectories , the scattering angle _ increases _ when the impact parameter _ increases _ ( fig.1a)(this is explained in section 4 ) , while the opposite is true in the classical case .",
    "+ b ) the deflection of bohmian trajectories takes place for initial conditions at an @xmath15 distance from the principal axis of the ingoing beam ( z - axis ) , where @xmath16 is the transverse quantum coherence length .",
    "a typical value for @xmath16 in electron beams is @xmath17 . on the contrary , for classical rutherford scattering the impact parameter @xmath18",
    "is many orders of magnitude smaller @xmath19 ) .",
    "+ c ) bohmian trajectories have the same form in both cases of repelling and attractive forces ( figure [ trjsch2]a ) , a behavior contrasted to the form of trajectories in the approximation of classical rutherford scattering ( fig.[trjsch2]b ) .",
    "+ d ) the most important difference regards the _ times of flight _ of particles to detectors placed at different scattering angles @xmath1 .",
    "the times of flight are shorter for larger impact parameters in the quantum case , independently of the sign of the interacting charges ( while the times of flight depend on this sign in the classical case and they are , in general , much shorter than in the quantum case ) .",
    "this effect suggests an interesting experimental test that will be described in section 5 .",
    "we consider a cylindrical beam of particles of mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath20 incident on a material target centered at the origin of the coordinate system of reference .",
    "cylindrical coordinates are denoted by @xmath21 ( horizontal ) , @xmath22 ( transverse ) and by the azimuth @xmath23 .",
    "use is also made of spherical coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the quantum - mechanical description of the diffraction process has been discussed extensively ( see , for example , @xcite for reviews and further references ) . here , we adopt a simplified model which is sufficient for all practical purposes in the analysis below . for the interaction of the incident charged particles with any individual atom in the target ,",
    "we adopt a screened coulomb potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the nuclear charge , @xmath28 is the position of the @xmath29 atom in the target and @xmath30 is a constant representing the screening range , whose value is taken of the order of the atomic size . the total potential felt by one incident particle",
    "is the sum of the individual potentials : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total number of atoms effectively participating in the process of diffraction .    in order to describe diffraction quantum - mechanically ,",
    "we specify a model for the wavefunction @xmath3 of diffracted particles ( considering only elastic scattering ) . to this end",
    ", we first find the eigenfunctions @xmath33 of the time - independent schrdinger equation : @xmath34 where @xmath33 is an eigenfunction corresponding to the energy value @xmath35 of an incident particle , and @xmath36 in ( [ sch5 ] ) is a time - averaged form of ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "we solve eq.([sch5 ] ) following born s approximation method ( for @xmath37)and expand @xmath33 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 etc .",

    "the corrections due to the @xmath49 and @xmath50 terms will be omitted since they do not affect essentially the analysis .",
    "the time - dependent eigenfunctions are now given by @xmath51 .",
    "the electron wavefunction can be modeled as a superposition of eigenfunctions @xmath52 where @xmath53 are fourier coefficients .",
    "because of the collimation , the ingoing term of the wavefunction at @xmath54 can be modeled as a traveling plane wave along the z - direction times a gaussian in the transverse direction with dispersion @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 where , assuming that the particles are monoenergetic , the constant @xmath57 yields the average momentum @xmath58 , or kinetic energy @xmath59 along the z - direction . the value of the transverse quantum coherence length @xmath16 , which turns to be a crucial parameter in the analysis below , depends on the details of the electron emission and collimation process .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath53 for which @xmath60 has the form ( [ psigauss ] ) are given by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "substituting ( [ psifour ] ) into ( [ psiall ] ) , and using ( [ phiall ] ) , we can evaluate the form of the wavefunction at all times @xmath63 .",
    "after some algebra we find @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 , hereafter called the _ effective fraunhofer function _ , denotes the following sum over all @xmath32 atomic positions @xmath68 in the target : @xmath69~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective fraunhofer function @xmath67 accounts for the usual diffraction effects . in numerical calculations we consider , for simplicity , the case where the target has a polycrystalline structure .",
    "then , the diffraction pattern becomes axisymmetric and the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath23 disappears .",
    "we then derive a fitting model for @xmath70 ( see appendix a ) which substitutes the sum ( [ seff ] ) in all subsequent calculations .",
    "this model reads : @xmath71 } { k_0a\\sin(\\theta_q)(\\theta-\\theta_q)}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( 1-e^{-{1\\over 2}4k_0 ^ 2\\sin^4(\\theta/2)\\sigma_a^2})c_{diffuse}\\sqrt{d / a}\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 are bragg angles defined by @xmath73 in eq.([sbfin ] ) , @xmath74 is the target thickness , @xmath75 is the distance between nearest atoms ( assuming for simplicity a cubic unit cell , see appendix a ) . the first term in the r.h.s . of eq.([sbfin ] ) describes a coherent contribution to the outgoing electron wave exhibiting sharp peaks at all bragg angles @xmath72 .",
    "the second term describes diffuse scattering due e.g. to thermal fluctuations or recoil effects in the target .",
    "these are modeled by the constant @xmath76 ( dimension of length ) which measures the amplitude of random motions of the atoms ( see appendix a ) . accordingly , the exponential factors in eq.([sbfin ] ) are debye - waller factors . finally , the constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 are fitting constants whose values are fixed by a numerical simulation , while @xmath79 is an arbitrary phase ( see appendix a ) .    in all subsequent calculations ,",
    "we use the set of eqs.([psiit],[psiot],[sbfin ] ) which completely specify the wavefunction . in numerical examples",
    "we adopt the following set of parameter values : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82nm@xmath83 ( corresponding to electrons with energy @xmath84kev , or wavelength @xmath85 nm ) , @xmath86 nm ( corresponding to a transverse quantum coherence length 1@xmath87 m ) , @xmath88 ( gold ) , @xmath89 nm , @xmath90 nm , @xmath91 nm , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( found by numerical fitting ) , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "these values are relevant to the case of electron diffraction , while they conform with a number of limitations imposed by our approximations to the wavefunction model .",
    "some main limitations are :    a)the energy @xmath96 ( determined by the particles mass @xmath4 and wavenumber @xmath57 ) must be well above the atomic energy levels in the crystal ( which are of the order of 1kev ) and below the nuclear energies ( which are of the order of 1mev ) . in our case",
    "the energy @xmath97 is within these limits .",
    "thus only the elastic term in the outgoing wavefunction needs to be considered .",
    "\\b ) the use of born s approximation is valid only sufficiently far from all atoms so that @xmath37 . in the case of the potential of eqs.([potatom ] ) and ( [ pot ] ) , this is true at all points @xmath98 of space with distance greater than a few times the size of the atoms in the target .",
    "all calculated bohmian trajectories in the sequel lie in regions exceeding by far such distances .",
    "\\c ) the inequality @xmath99 sets an upper limit in the time during which the ingoing wavefunction remains coherent in the transverse direction . setting @xmath100 as above , we find @xmath101sec , so that the total distance traveled by individual electrons should be less than 1 m , which is a quite long , hence a feasible value .",
    "finally , we note that the representation of the beam as a plane wave in the z - direction can also be improved by introducing a finite ` longitudinal coherence length ' @xmath102 , i.e. a wavepacket approach in the z - direction as well . in this case , the fitting model of appendix a is no longer valid and a separate analysis must be made covering the cases @xmath103 or @xmath104 ( work in progress @xcite ) .",
    "the form of the quantum currents in the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ psiit],[psiot],[sbfin ] ) can be understood qualitatively by the following remarks : +      the ingoing and outgoing waves become equal in size if @xmath105 . since @xmath106 for all times of interest , one has from eqs.([psiit ] ) and ( [ psiot ] ) @xmath107 the roots of eq.([rthnod ] ) yield _ a separator line _ on the meridian plane @xmath108 which acts as a delimiter between the domains of prevalence of the axial ingoing from the radial outgoing flow .",
    "figure [ curgen ] corresponds to a numerical calculation , where the arrows indicate the local direction of the quantum flow at every point of the configuration space .",
    "clearly , the transition from axial ingoing to radial outgoing flow takes place essentially through the separator lines ( bold lines ) .",
    ", [ psiot],[sbfin ] ) and parameters as specified in the text . ]",
    "ray - like structures in the right part of fig.([curgen ] ) correspond to the form taken by the separator locally near every bragg angle .",
    "important details of the separator structure are not discernible at this resolution , appearing only when we zoom very close to one bragg angle . from eq.([rthnod ] ) we can see that roots exist only if @xmath109 satisfies @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the maximum value of @xmath112 , equal to @xmath113 .",
    "then the two roots @xmath114 and @xmath115 define a lower and un upper branch of the separator . only the upper branch @xmath116 is shown in figure [ curgen ] , since for most angles @xmath1 the lower branch corresponds to values of @xmath117 smaller than @xmath116 by many orders of magnitude .     in a small neighborhood of the fourth bragg angle @xmath118rad .",
    "the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the level value @xmath119 nm .",
    "the inner and outer separator curves are joined at the angles @xmath120rad and @xmath121rad , and a channel of radial flow is formed , of width @xmath122rad .",
    "the function @xmath109 becomes zero at the two closest zeros of the effective fraunhofer function near the bragg peak at @xmath123 , namely at the angles @xmath124 and @xmath125 . at these angles",
    "@xmath126 becomes zero while @xmath127 tends to infinity .",
    "( b ) the form of the separator curves @xmath128 in the same range of angles @xmath1 as in ( a ) .",
    "( c , d ) same as in ( a , b ) but for a neighborhood of the bragg angle @xmath129 . ]    the above picture changes very close to one bragg angle @xmath72 , where @xmath117 becomes also important .",
    "this is because the local peaks of @xmath130 imply also local peaks of the function @xmath109 in eq.([rthnod ] ) .",
    "according to the local value of the function @xmath131 we distinguish the following two cases : + _ case i : @xmath132_. in this case there is an interval of values @xmath133 containing the bragg angle @xmath72 such that eq.([rthnod ] ) has no roots within it ( figure [ channel]a ) .",
    "then , the inner separator @xmath117 of fig.[channel]b joins the outer separator @xmath116 at the angles @xmath134 and @xmath135 and takes the form shown in fig.[channel]b ( in coordinates @xmath22 vs. @xmath1 ) .",
    "the gap between the left and right domains of prevalence of the ingoing flow corresponds to a narrow angular strip ( hereafter called a ` channel ' ) along which the flow is radial .",
    "+ _ case ii : @xmath136_. in this case there are roots of both @xmath117 and @xmath116 for all angles @xmath1 surrounding and including @xmath72 ( fig.[channel]c ) .",
    "however , @xmath117 has a local maximum and @xmath116 a local minimum at @xmath72 as well as on all other peaks caused by the side lobes of the fraunhofer function .",
    "the separator then develops oscillations as shown in fig.[channel]d .",
    "furthermore , in this case there may be one or more pairs of angles @xmath137 where the inner , and outer , separator reaches the z - axis , and infinity , respectively .",
    "two such pairs are visible in fig.[channel]d .",
    "along the separator , a large number of quantum vortices are formed .",
    "their location is given by all points where the conditions i ) @xmath138 , and ii)@xmath139 hold .",
    "such points are called _",
    "nodal points_. the condition @xmath138 , or @xmath140 yields , besides eq.([rthnod ] ) , a condition for the equality of phases , which takes the form ( ignoring again @xmath141 terms ) @xmath142 the pair of equations ( [ rthnod],[phaseeq ] ) specifies completely the coordinates of one nodal point(r,@xmath1 ) .",
    "we locate many nodal points numerically by choosing different values of @xmath143 .",
    "it follows from eq.([phaseeq ] ) that the separation between two nearby nodal points , defined by two values @xmath143 and @xmath144 , is of order @xmath145 .",
    "( @xmath146 nm , @xmath147 nm ) .",
    "the flow forms a ` nodal point - x - point ' complex ( nodal point ( n ) , x - point ( x ) ) and follows in general one branch of the stable manifold ( s ) and then one branch of the unstable manifold ( u ) of the x - point .",
    "the other branches ( ss , uu ) are joined to form a loop .",

    "the local form of the quantum flow in a very small neighborhood around one nodal point is very different from the general picture of the flow as given in fig.[curgen ] .",
    "if we ` freeze ' the time @xmath63 , the instantaneous pattern formed by the vector field of quantum probability current @xmath152 corresponds to a characteristic structure called _ nodal point - x - point complex _ @xcite .",
    "that is , close to a nodal point we find a second critical point of the flow , where one has @xmath153 .",
    "this is called an ` x - point ' , since it can be shown that it is always simply unstable , i.e. there are two real eigenvalues of the matrix of the linearized flow around x , which are one positive and one negative .",
    "accordingly , there are two opposite branches of unstable ( u ) and stable ( s ) manifolds emanating from x. on the other hand , the nodal point can be an attractor , center , or repellor .",
    "this determines the local form of the invariant manifolds u and s. it has been established theoretically @xcite that , except for a set of very small measure , most quantum trajectories _",
    "avoid _ the nodal point , being instead scattered along the asymptotic directions of the manifolds of the x - point , leading to large distances from the nodal point - x - point complex .",
    "furthermore , while , in general , the motion of nodal point - x - point complexes introduces chaos ( @xcite ) , in the present problem this effect is negligible because i ) the speed of vortices is extremely small ( of order @xmath154 ) , and ii ) the quantum trajectories exhibit only a finite number of encounters with nodal point - x - point complexes , as will be shown with numerical examples below . in conclusion",
    ", the effect of the nodal point - x - point complexes on the trajectories can be described as a scattering process without recurrences .",
    "figures [ nodal]a , b show two examples of such nodal point - x - point complexes , in which the central nodal points are located on the left side ( fig.[nodal]a ) and right side ( fig.[nodal]b ) respectively of the main channel around the fourth bragg angle shown in fig.[channel]b .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds of the x - points ( found numerically ) are shown like thick curves in the same figures .",
    "in fig.[nodal]a , the left branch of the stable manifold is almost horizontal far from the x - point , while the right branch of the unstable manifold follows a radial direction which coincides with the direction defined by the local value of the scattering angle @xmath1 .",
    "the other two branches form loops around the nodal point .",
    "if the terms @xmath155 in the wavefunction are ignored , the two branches join each other smoothly and the nodal point is a center .",
    "if however , all terms are taken into account , the nodal point is either an attractor or a repellor ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then one of the two branches in - spirals towards the nodal point , while the other deviates outwards after forming a nearly complete loop around the nodal point . in the present case ,",
    "the time dependence of the wavefunction introduces negligible effects and the loops formed around all nodal points can be considered as practically closed .",
    "then , in fig.[nodal]a we see that , due to the form of the stable and unstable manifolds , trajectories approaching the x - point from the left in a nearly horizontal direction are scattered by the x - point .",
    "a scattered trajectory may or may not form a loop around the nodal point . in either case ,",
    "the trajectories eventually recede from the x - point along the unstable manifold , and follow asymptotically a radial direction ( upwards and to the right in fig.[nodal]a ) .",

    "the swapping can be understood with the help of a schematic figure ( fig.[nodal]c ) .",

    "this effect is in contrast to the picture of classical rutherford scattering and it can be regarded as a clear manifestation of the quantum character of diffraction for a large transverse quantum coherence length .",
    "such behavior of the quantum trajectories is readily accounted for by the fact that the average inclination of the separator in the @xmath202 plane is negative .",
    "namely , since all trajectories are horizontal until they encounter the separator , trajectories of larger initial @xmath197 encounter the separator at a larger angle @xmath1 satisfying eq.([rthnod ] ) with @xmath203(fig.1a ) .",

    "the trajectories that started closer to the z - axis follow initially the general flow due to @xmath60 , but they are subject to abrupt deflections at the crossing of any bragg angle .",

    "( c ) same as in ( b ) but for the crossing of the channel of the first bragg angle @xmath214 . in this case",
    "the trajectory never reaches the right border of the channel . ]",
    "since @xmath60 is larger closer to the z - axis , the orbits that started closer to the z - axis have larger probability to cross more channels and end either with horizontal motion , or radial motion along the direction of one of the first bragg angles .",
    "this leads to a complete stratification of the flow as shown in fig.[orbits ] . on the other hand , due to attenuation effects ( section 2 ) the channels practically disappear beyond some bragg angle and the separator takes locally the form of fig.[channel]d , with oscillations of smaller and smaller amplitude .",
    "this causes a gradually smaller concentration of the exiting trajectories around the bragg angles @xmath72 with high @xmath215 , leading eventually to a diffuse form of the radial outward flow at large angles @xmath1 .",
    "an important practical utility of the quantum trajectory approach regards the possibility to unambiguously determine the _ times of flight _ of particles , i.e. the time it takes for a particle to travel between an emitter surface and a detector surface .",
    "this question is of particular interest , because it is related to a well known open problem of quantum theory , namely the so - called ` problem of time ' ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this problem stems from a theorem of pauli @xcite , according to which it is not possible to properly define a self - adjoint time operator consistent with all axioms of quantum mechanics .",
    "this implies that the usual ( copenhagen ) ) formalism based on state vectors or density matrices is not applicable to a quantum - theoretical calculation of probabilities related to time observables ( e.g. the distribution of arrival times to a detector or the times of flight defined as above ) .",
    "in fact , in standard quantum mechanics ( i.e. in both schrdinger s and heisenberg s pictures ) , time is considered only as a parameter of the quantum equations of motion .    among various proposals in the literature aiming to remedy this gap of standard quantum theory ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the bohmian formalism offers a straightforward solution , since the time of flight is well - defined along the bohmian trajectories .",
    "this is in principle subject to experimental testing , and one such test will be proposed below .",
    "we note in passing two other approaches on the same subject , namely the ` history approach ' , based on feynman paths , and the kijowski approach ( @xcite ) , based on so - called  bohm - aharonov ( @xcite ) operators .",
    "however these approaches have not been so far as clearly formulated as the bohmian formulation .     of the arrival times of particles to detectors placed at the angles @xmath1 and @xmath216 respectively and at the same distance from the center , for the quantum trajectories of fig.[orbits]a .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to the analytic estimate of eq.([dtth2 ] ) .",
    "the arrows correspond to the first four bragg angles . ]",
    "a calculation of the times of flight in the case of the trajectories of fig.[orbits ] can be done as follows .",
    "we note first that , as a simple visual inspection of of fig.[orbits ] shows , starting from a fixed horizontal distance from the left ( source ) , the trajectories that are deflected to large angles are shorter in length than the trajectories deflected to small angles , provided that the final detection point is at the same distance @xmath217 from the center .",
    "we can quantify this difference by approximating the form of the trajectories as horizontal up to their deflection at the outer separator and radial afterwards .",
    "the modulus of the velocity remains nearly constant @xmath218 in both the horizontal and radial segments of the trajectory .",
    "taking into account the separator equation ( eq.([rthnod ] ) ) , we estimate the length , and hence the time difference between two trajectories deflected at two arbitrary angles @xmath219 and @xmath220 by a simple geometric analysis .",
    "if the separator is approximated by a straight line between the two angles ( e.g. in the forward and backward directions @xmath221 , @xmath222 ) we find : @xmath223 where the slope @xmath224 is normalized to its value for the pair @xmath225 namely @xmath226 with @xmath227 , @xmath228 calculated by eq.([rthnod ] ) with @xmath1 substituted by @xmath219 and @xmath220 respectively .",
    "eq.([dtth2 ] ) agrees well with a numerical computation of the times of flight for various angles @xmath1 ( see fig.[plttheta ] ) .",
    "the main remark is that , since @xmath229 ( cf .",
    "eq.([rthnod ] ) ) , the time difference @xmath230 for two fixed angles is proportional to the transverse quantum coherence length @xmath16 .",
    "that is , eq.([dtth2 ] ) leads to the estimate @xmath231 .",
    "this is a relation that can be tested experimentally .",
    "in fact , it is very different to what is found in the case of rutherford scattering ( compare figs.[trjsch2]a and [ trjsch2]b ) , where a straightforward analysis yields @xmath232 i.e. the time difference @xmath230 does not depend on the transverse quantum coherence length @xmath16 and it has a different dependence @xmath233 , rather than @xmath234 , on the particles velocities . in the case of electrons ,",
    "the classical time difference is of order @xmath235 , while , assuming @xmath236 the quantum time difference is of order @xmath237 .",
    "we note that the latter time - resolution scale is within present - day experimental possibilities .",
    "however , in order that the experiment becomes feasible , one should be able to combine very accurate time measurements with single - electron detectors ( see @xcite for a review of recent experimental techniques on quantum - mechanical time measurements ) .",
    "furthermore , one should also be able to have a control signal for the _ emission _ times of electrons .",
    "this is a largely unexplored subject ( one possibility is probably offered by the so - called laser induced field emission ; see @xcite ) . at any rate , in view of theoretical results like the above , we think it is safe to anticipate that the advent of experimental _ time measurement _ techniques in systems with a genuinely quantum behavior will open a new window for probing quantum mechanics at a very fundamental level .",
    "we applied the method of the de broglie - bohm quantum trajectories in the problem of charged particle diffraction from thin material targets , focusing on the case of significant transverse quantum coherence of the particle beam , where new genuinely quantum phenomena appear .",
    "in particular : + 1 ) we constructed a model for the wavefunction of diffracted particles which takes into account both processes of coherent ( giving rise to bragg angles ) and diffuse scattering .",
    "\\2 ) we developed a theory for the quantum - current structure near a locus called _ separator _",
    ", i.e. the border between an inner tube of ingoing flow surrounding the beam s axis of symmetry and an outer domain , where the radial outward flow prevails .",
    "analytical expressions are found for the separator .",
    "the separator forms thin channels of radial flow very close to every bragg angle . such channels are responsible for the concentration of quantum trajectories to particular directions of exit from the ingoing flux tube .",
    "\\3 ) the deflection of quantum trajectories is due to their interaction with an array of _ quantum vortices _ formed around a large number of nodal points located on the separator .",
    "the quantum flow near every nodal point takes the form of a ` nodal point - x - point complex ' .",
    "the size of quantum vortices is estimated analytically close to and far from bragg angles , the estimate being in close agreement with numerical results .",
    "\\4 ) the emergence of a diffraction pattern is explained in terms of numerically calculated quantum trajectories . in particular , we demonstrate the sharp deflections of the trajectories as they approach one or more x - points along the latters stable manifolds , and recede from these points along their unstable manifolds .",
    "the radically non - classical character of the quantum trajectories is demonstrated .",
    "we find that trajectories with larger initial distance @xmath197 from the central axis of the ingoing flux tube ( i.e. larger impact parameter ) are deflected to larger angles @xmath1 .",
    "this is contrary to the classical rutherford scattering , where the trajectories with larger impact parameter are deflected to smaller angles @xmath1 .",
    "\\5 ) the times of flight @xmath238 of particles to detectors placed at constant distances and various angles @xmath1 from the target are calculated by an analytical approximation and compared to numerical results .",
    "it is demonstrated that the time difference @xmath230 follows the scaling @xmath231 , where @xmath16 is the transverse quantum coherence length and @xmath239 the average particles velocity .",
    "this scaling is different than in classical rutherford scattering where @xmath240 and it leads to the possibility of an experimental test of the bohmian formalism in a sector of quantum theory where the copenhagen approach offers no standard recipe , i.e. the sector of time observables . c. delis was supported by the state scholarship foundation of greece ( iky ) and by the hellenic center of metals research .",
    "we consider the simplest example of a cubic lattice arrangement of the atoms in the target .",
    "the atomic positions @xmath28 are given by : @xmath241 where @xmath75 is the lattice constant ( equal to the length of one side of the primitive cell ) , @xmath242 is the amplitude of random oscillations ( due to thermal or recoil motions ; @xmath242 is taken equal to a small fraction of @xmath75 ) and @xmath243 are random variables with a uniform distribution in the intervals @xmath244 $ ] .",
