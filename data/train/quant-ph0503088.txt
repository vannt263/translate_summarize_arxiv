    "a principal goal of quantum information theory is to understand the resources necessary and sufficient for intact transmission of quantum states@xcite .",
    "obviously , alice ( the sender ) can either physically send the particle ( which is not interesting ) or send a double infinity of bits of information across a classical channel to bob .",
    "however , quantum teleportation@xcite has provided us an interesting way to transmitting an arbitary quantum state using one maximal - entangled state ( 1 ebit ) and two classical bits information ( 2 cbits ) .",
    "recently , remote state preparation ( rsp)@xcite attracts attention of many scientists .",
    "rsp provides us a simple method to transmit pure quantum states using entanglement and classical communication when the sender knows the transmitted state and the receiver has partial knowledge of it .",
    "rsp protocols more economical than teleportation were found for certain ensembles@xcite .",
    "the resources of 1 ebit and 2 cbits are sufficient and necessary for teleportation , while it can be reduced to 1 ebit and 1 cbit in asymptotics for remote state preparation",
    ". such trade - off has been extent among resources of noiseless classical channels , noiseless quantum channels and maximally - entangled states in the generalized remote state preparation@xcite .",
    "an experiment of rsp has been demonstrated in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) systems@xcite .",
    "recently , the rsp protocol is generalized from pure states to mixed ones .",
    "the essence is to replace von neumann measurement by positive operator - valued measure ( povm)@xcite . here we present a scheme for remote preparation of mixed states ( including pure ones ) and realize it for the polarization states of single photons .",
    "all protocols about rsp above is ( deterministic or probabilistic ) exact , in which state that bob gets is as same as the one alice wants to prepare .",
    "it is based on the maximally - entangled state shared between the two sides . however , entanglement is fragile under the interaction with environment . in this paper ,",
    "two types of decoherence , depolarizing and dephasing , are discussed by using the state fidelity in theory as well as in our experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as following .",
    "a rsp scheme of mixed states is presented in section ii .",
    "the effect of decoherence is discussed with state fidelity in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we carry out an experiment to remotely prepare pure and mixed states with dephaseing noisy entanglement . and",
    "a conclusion will be given in section v.",
    "an arbitrary state of single qubit can be represented as a vector @xmath0 on or inside the bloch sphere ( see fig.1 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the state is a pure one @xmath6 for @xmath7 ( on the sphere ) , or a mixed one for @xmath8 ( inside the sphere ) . specially , it is a maximally - mixed one @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( zero vector ) .    in rsp protocol for pure states ,",
    "a state subset @xmath11 is pre - agreed by alice and bob .",
    "particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , shared by alice and bob , are in maximally entangled state @xmath14 and alice wants to help bob prepare a state @xmath15 in the distance . here",
    "@xmath16 is selected from @xmath17 randomly by alice and is unknown to bob .",
    "for example , @xmath18 can be the equatorial or polar great circle on the bloch sphere and @xmath16  is randomly selected from it .    to complete rsp , we can expand @xmath19 in the basis \\{@xmath20 } , @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "alice would perform a von neumann measurement @xmath23 on her particle @xmath12 and send the result @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) to bob . or she can ( @xmath26 ) perform a unitary rotation @xmath27 on @xmath12 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) carry out a von neumann measurement @xmath31 ; and ( @xmath32 ) send the result @xmath24 ( @xmath33 ) to bob ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "if the result is @xmath34 , bob will find his particle @xmath13 in @xmath16 , which is the state alice wants to prepare .",
    "for the result @xmath35 , @xmath13 will be in @xmath36  and an operation  is need for bob to flip @xmath37  into @xmath16 .",
    "generally , such operation is unavailable because the universal @xmath38 gate is forbidden for bob has no knowledge of the state .",
    "however , it is possible for some special @xmath11 , such as @xmath39 for the polar greatest circle and @xmath40 for the equatorial circle . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we only discuss the situation that alice obtain the result @xmath34 .    in @xcite , berry and sanders",
    "have generalized the protocol to mixed state preparation by using povm instead of von neumann measurement .",
    "the mixed state to be prepared ( see eq.(1 ) ) can be decomposed into @xmath41 to complete rsp of @xmath42 , alice would carry out a two - element povm @xmath43 instead of @xmath31 , @xmath44 if alice gets the result 1 , @xmath13 will be in @xmath45 .",
    "the essence is the realization of povm . here",
    ", the povm can be performed by an auxiliary qubit and @xmath46 operation .",
    "the whole process of rsp can be divided into the following five steps ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "@xmath34 ) a unitary rotation @xmath47 on @xmath12 ; @xmath48 ) a @xmath46 operation @xmath49 where @xmath12 is the controller and the auxiliary qubit @xmath50 in initial state @xmath51 is the target ; @xmath52 ) another unitary rotation @xmath53 on @xmath12 ; @xmath54 ) a von neumann measurement on @xmath12 ; and @xmath55 ) sending the result to bob . and",

    "all the discussions above , both pure and mixed states , are based on the maximally entangled states shared between alice and bob . due to the interaction with the environment ,",
    "the entanglement will be partially destroyed .",
    "such decoherence is possible during the distribution or storage of entanglement , so the final result of rsp will be influenced .",
    "generally , all physical processes , including decoherence evolution , can be represented by a complete positive map .",
    "suppose alice and bob share an entangled state after decoherence , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the operator of decoherence evolution .",
    "the final state that bob obtains after the five steps above ( @xmath61 ) will be @xmath62}{tr_{aba}[\\left| 1\\right\\rangle _ { a\\ a}\\left\\langle 1\\right| \\varrho _ { aba}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath63 the effects of decoherence on rsp can be denoted by the state fidelity between @xmath64 and @xmath42 ( to be prepared ) , @xmath65.\\ ] ] here , two types of decoherence are considered , depolarizing and dephasing .",
    "the entangled state after depolarizing is @xmath66 which can be considered as a mixture of maximal entanglement and maximal mixed state .",
    "the result state that bob gets is @xmath67 and the state fidelity is @xmath68 specially , for maximal entanglement shared @xmath69 , @xmath70 ; for pure states to be prepared @xmath7,@xmath71 ; and for maximally - mixed states @xmath72 , @xmath70 .",
    "we found that the fidelity is independent of @xmath73 and @xmath74 and only related to the quantum channel ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 .    for dephasing decoherence ,",
    "@xmath77 it can be considered as a mixture of maximal entanglement and classical correlation .",
    "the result state and the fidelity of rsp are @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 specially , for maximal entanglement shared @xmath69 , @xmath70 ; for pure states @xmath82 , @xmath83 ; and for @xmath10 , @xmath70 .    here",
    "the fidelity for depolarizing is found to be independent on states to be prepared .",
    "while for dephasing , it depends only on the proportion of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , _",
    "i.e. _ depending on @xmath86 , but not on the relative phase @xmath74 . and ,",
    "obviously , the later is better than former , which means classical correlation can help remote state preparation .",
    "in this section , an experiment of remote state preparation for single photons is carried out by using spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) and linear optical elements . here",
    ", we only discuss the rsp in dephasing noisy channel .",
    "the setup is represented in fig.@xmath52 .",
    "a pulse of ultraviolet ( uv ) light pass through a bbo crystal ( @xmath87 mm , cut for type - ii phase match ) .",
    "the uv pulse is frequency - doubled pulse ( less than @xmath88 fs with @xmath89 mhz repetition and @xmath90 nm center - wavelength ) from a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( tsunami by spectra - physics ) . because of the birefringence of ordinary light ( @xmath91 light ) and extra - ordinary light ( @xmath92 light ) in bbo crystal , the state of the biphoton from spdc process is no longer the maximal entangled one , but is the the state like @xmath93 where @xmath75 can be adjusted by quartz plate with different thickness . in our experiment , we only chose @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath96 , we use the technology of tomography to reconstruct density matrix of the state from spdc process@xcite , @xmath97 the fidelity between @xmath98 and the upper state we get experimently is @xmath99 . and also , we get the state from spdc process when @xmath100 , the fidelity is @xmath101 .",
    "we have possessed the perfect quantum channel ( noisy entanglement ) , and next , we can carry out our schemes of remote state preparation .    in fig.3 , photon a passes through path @xmath48 .",
    "first , it is rotated by qwp1 and hwp1 which realize the unitary operator @xmath102(see eq.(5 ) ) .",
    "second , photon a transmits a @xmath103 mm @xmath104-bbo crystal , whose @xmath91 axis is fixed horizontally and @xmath92 axis is fixed vertically .",
    "here we chose the time degrees of freedom of photon a passing through bbo crystal to be the auxiliary qubit ( @xmath105 for ordinary light and @xmath106 for extra - ordinary light ) .",
    "after @xmath103 mm bbo crystal , the separation of wavepackets between h@xmath107- and v@xmath108-polarized light is about @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "because the coherent length of the wavepacket is about 150 @xmath110 ( 4 nm fwhm interference filter is inserted before each detector ) , there is is no superposed parts between the h@xmath107- and v@xmath108-polarized light .",
    "so a controlled - not operation is accomplished after the photon a passes through the bbo crystal @xmath111 where the polarization , @xmath112(@xmath51)/@xmath113(@xmath114 ) , is the control qubit and the time , @xmath115(@xmath116)/@xmath106(@xmath117 ) , is the target qubit . in our experiment ,",
    "the input target qubit is fixed in @xmath105(@xmath51 ) . following @xmath103 mm bbo , photon",
    "a is operated by hwp2 which realizes the unitary @xmath53(see eq.(9 ) ) .",
    "the time qubit is traced when the photon is detected by a single photon detector .",
    "photon b passes through path 1 .",
    "any single - qubit mixed states alice want to prepare can be remotely prepared in bob s laboratory by adjusting the angles of qwp1 , hwp1 and hwp2@xcite at alice s side , and bob can use technology of quantum state tomography to reconstruct the density matrix of it .    to prepare pure states , we fixed the angle of hwp2 @xmath35 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "qwp1 and hwp1 can help alice remotely prepare any pure states in bob s laboratory .",
    "bob use technology of tomography to reconstruct the state matrix of it again .    in our experiment ,",
    "several pre - agreed state sets are selected ( see in fig.1 ) . for each pre - agreed state set , we finish the process of rsp when @xmath96 and @xmath95 respectively as shown in fig.4 and fig.5 .",

    "fig.5 tell us that the the fidelity of rsp of mixed state is the cosine function of @xmath86 , and the fidelity of the maximally mixed state is always one(fig.5a ) .",
    "the effect of noise to pure states is greater than mixed states ( fig.5b ) . in fig.4 and fig.5",
    ", the solid lines are the theoretical results given by eq.(20 ) .",
    "for example , in fig.4b , the state from the polar great circle on the sphere crossed by x - z plane ( @xmath128 $ ] , @xmath119 ) are remotely prepared and the parameter of channel @xmath100 , so the fidelity curve given by eq.(20 ) is @xmath129 .",
    "it is found that all experiment results ( the square dots ) match the theoretical prediction ( the solid lines ) well .",
    "the imperfection of our experimental results only comes from the fluctuation of the coincidence counts and the limited precision ( @xmath130 ) of waveplates ( hwps and qwps)@xcite .",
