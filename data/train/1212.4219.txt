    "galaxy clusters can be used to constrain cosmological parameters such as @xmath4 or the dark energy equation of state by , for example , measuring their abundances or mass function @xcite . as the largest virialized structures in the universe , clusters trace the large - scale structure in the universe , and their distribution is a test for models of structure formation and evolution . in order to use galaxy clusters as tools , we require reliable estimates of their masses . since mass is not an observable quantity , other measureables must be used as proxies . scaling relations between the fundamental physical property - total mass - and observables , such as",
    "the x - ray luminosity or temperature of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , or the composite parameter @xmath5 , are therefore essential ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assumptions of self - similarity can simplify the use of scaling relations between cluster properties .",
    "however , studies at low redshift find deviations from self - similarity among virialized clusters , suggesting the influence of non - gravitational processes , such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback , on the formation and evolution of clusters @xcite",
    ". we would expect non - gravitational heating to vary with time , which would affect the redshift evolution of the scaling relations .",
    "a number of studies have sought to evaluate this evolution with observations at higher redshifts .",

    "@xcite , using an extensive @xmath6 sample compiled from the literature , find that the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation scales as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , in contrast to the @xmath9  prediction from self - similarity . as with the deviations found in local scaling relations , this result would indicate a significant heating contribution from non - gravitational sources , although different processes may be important at higher redshifts .",
    "scaling relations between cluster properties are often calibrated using local virialized clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite . while the bcg in cl 1604b does not have a large physical or velocity offset , which would have provided further evidence against virialization , cl 1604b and rx j0910 + 5419 have the largest offsets between the red galaxy density peak and x - ray emission centroid of all the clusters in our sample .",
    "this result could imply that these clusters are still in the process of forming .",
    "the d - s tests for these two clusters do not provide good evidence for substructure , and there is no clear evidence that the velocity dispersions for cl 1604b and rx j0910 + 5419 are inflated .",

    "three clusters in our sample ( cl 1324 + 3013 , rx j1757 , and cl 1604a ) are consistent with all scaling relations while rx j0910 + 5422 is only marginally inconsistent with the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation . while relaxed clusters are expected to fall along these relations , it is possible for unrelaxed clusters to do so as well ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as for the other clusters , we can use additional diagnostics to further probe their dynamical states .",
    "unfortunately , of these four clusters , only cl 1604a has enough spectroscopically confirmed members to accurately determine red and blue galaxy velocity dispersions separately .",
    "as expected for a relaxed cluster , we find significantly different velocity dispersions and consistent mean velocities for the red and blue galaxy populations in cl 1604a .",

    ", the highly asymmetric contour could indicate a recent merger or that the cluster is still in the process of forming .",
    "since we were unable to measure a temperature for this cluster , we do not know if it is consistent with two of the three scaling relations studied .",

    "it is likely that rx j1757 , cl 1604a and rx j0910 + 5419 are relaxed clusters .    while our evidence points to two clusters appearing unrelaxed",
    ", it is still possible that the offsets from the virialization relations could be the result of incomplete spectroscopy .",
    "this concern is validated by past observations of cl 1324 + 3011 , where @xcite measured a dispersion of @xmath35 km  s@xmath15  using 47 galaxies within the entire lris field of view , well above the @xmath92-t and @xmath2-@xmath92 relations for virialized clusters . since then",
    ", we have taken spectroscopic data on the cl 1324 supercluster using 10 deimos masks .",
    "our most recent velocity dispersion measurement , shown in table [ specanntab ] , is @xmath129 km  s@xmath15 , using 45 galaxies within 1 @xmath66 mpc of the red galaxy density peak , offset from the @xmath92-t relation by less than @xmath130 .",
    "while we used fewer galaxies than @xcite , we measure the dispersion in a region consistent with the other clusters in our sample , and where the spectroscopic completeness is much improved .",
    "the new , more reliable set of cluster members had a significant effect on the velocity dispersion measurement and the scaling relations .",
    "the clusters with fewer high - quality spectra would be most prone to mismeasurement , such as those in the rx j0910 supercluster and cl 1324 + 3013 .      the orelse survey has a multiwavelength dataset , including an unprecedented amount of spectroscopic data for clusters embedded in large - scale structure at high redshifts .",
    "these data have allowed us to implement a broader variety of diagnostics of the clusters dynamical states than possible for most clusters at comparable redshifts . while many studies involving scaling relations attempt to identify unrelaxed clusters , dynamical states are often determined using only x - ray morphology of clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for our sample ,",
    "we find that x - ray morphology alone is insufficient to identify the unrelaxed clusters . the clusters that we determined to be unrelaxed , cl 1604b and rx j0910 + 5419 , do not have the most asymmetric x - ray contours . while differing measures of asymmetry are used throughout the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "highly exclusive cuts would be necessary to remove all unrelaxed clusters from our sample .    while current morphology cut techniques may be sufficient for some studies , the problem of efficiently determining dynamical states of clusters is important for cosmology .",
    "for example , measurements of @xmath4 using galaxy cluster counts or the cluster mass function are impacted by improper corrections for unrelaxed clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in a recent study",
    ", @xcite determined cluster masses using proxy properties . for unrelaxed clusters ,",
    "the masses estimated using their m-@xmath131 relation were shifted upward by a constant factor relative to relaxed clusters .",
    "this correction is justified because unrelaxed clusters , defined using x - ray morphology , have been found through simulations to have masses 17@xmath1325% higher than those of relaxed clusters for a given @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "other studies have found similar results using different selection methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with better selection of unrelaxed clusters , this correction , and the subsequent measurement of cosmological parameters , could be improved upon .",
    "the problem of unreliable mass measurements for unrelaxed clusters can also be bypassed by using the alternative mass proxy @xmath5 , which is the product of @xmath131 and @xmath133 , the mass of the icm gas , which is designed to be similar to and more easily measured than the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) flux @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the scatter in the @xmath134-@xmath5 relation is approximately 6% , compared to a @xmath135 scatter in the @xmath134-@xmath3 relation , without significant differences in mass measurements for relaxed and unrelaxed clusters .",
    "however , when only @xmath131 , or even more problematic only @xmath2 , is available , a better selection method is necessary to improve mass measurements for clusters .",
    "while the effect on measurements of @xmath4 may not be dramatic , systematics dominate the error budget of measurements from cluster surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the era of precision cosmology",
    ", reducing systematic errors is a worthwhile and important goal .    while our sample has demonstrated the deficiencies of selecting unrelaxed clusters based on x - ray morphology alone , it is too small to determine ways to significantly improve this method or to do more than provide a selection of possible alternatives , such as the offset between the x - ray centroid and the red galaxy density peak that appears to be indicative of an unrelaxed cluster ( see section [ sec : anal ] ) .",
    "however , the full orelse survey could supply the sample necessary to improve the selection of unrelaxed clusters .",
    "the orelse survey has chosen 20 clusters around which to search for large - scale structure .",
    "only six of these have been studied in detail . with detailed studies of the remaining 14 fields , and more data on some of the fields in this paper",
    ", many more clusters will be added to our sample . in addition",
    ", clusters from other sources with high - redshift multiwavelength datasets can be combined , such as from the massive cluster survey @xcite , the red - sequence cluster surveys @xcite , and samples selected with the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". these larger samples will provide even better potential for analysis of techniques of identifying relaxed clusters .",
    "we presented the results of a search for diffuse x - ray emission from clusters and groups in five large - scale structures at high redshifts using deep _",
    "chandra _ imaging .",
    "we detected emission from a total of nine clusters and were able to measure gas temperatures for eight of these . while we detected emission from the two isolated clusters , rx j1757 and rx j1821 , we only detected emission from two clusters in the cl 1604 supercluster and three clusters in the cl 1324 supercluster .",
    "we also detected emission from rx j0910 + 5419 and rx j0910 + 5422 .",
    "while there is evidence from infrared imaging of additional structure in the rx j0910 field @xcite , we do not detect emission from any other groups or clusters .",
    "except for cl 1604b and rx j0910 + 5419 , we found that all clusters with detected diffuse emission were consistent with velocity dispersion , gas temperature , and bolometric x - ray luminosity scaling relations for low-@xmath107 virialized clusters at the @xmath136 level , although two clusters in cl 1324 and rx j1821 may have inflated velocity dispersions , possibly due to filamentary structure or recent mergers .",
    "cl 1604b and rx j0910 + 5419 were offset from the scaling relations , although by modest amounts , which implies that these systems are still in the process of gravitationally heating . for cl 1604b ,",
    "this result is supported by analysis of the velocity dispersions of red and blue populations .",
    "we find minimal differences between the velocity dispersions of red and blue galaxies , less than for any other cluster , suggestive of a younger cluster and potential substructure @xcite .",

    "the bcg in rx j0910 + 5419 has a large peculiar velocity , and both this cluster and cl 1604b have large offsets between their red galaxy density peaks and the x - ray emission , which provides further evidence against virialization .",
    "several studies have found evidence for evolution in the virial relations . @xcite and",

    "<S> we use _ chandra _ observations of nine optically and x - ray selected clusters in five different structures at @xmath0 from the observations of redshift evolution in large - scale environments ( orelse ) survey to study diffuse x - ray emission from galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray gas temperatures and bolometric rest - frame luminosities are measured for each cluster in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we present new redshift measurements , derived from data obtained using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph on the keck 10-m telescope , for two clusters in the rx j0910 supercluster at @xmath1 , from which velocity dispersions are measured . </S>",
    "<S> dispersions for all clusters are combined with x - ray luminosities and gas temperatures to evaluate how the cluster properties compare to low - redshift scaling relations . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the degree of substructure in each cluster by examining the velocity histograms , performing dressler - shectman tests , and computing the offsets between the x - ray emission center and optically - derived centroids . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only two clusters show clear indications of being unrelaxed , based on their scaling relations and other dynamical state diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> using our sample , we evaluate the redshift evolution of the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation and investigate the implications of our results for precision cosmology surveys . </S>"
