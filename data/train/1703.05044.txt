    "let @xmath0 be the mapping class group of a closed surface  @xmath1 ( with genus@xmath2 ) , equipped with any finite generating set  @xmath3 .",
    "it is a widely held belief that `` most '' elements of  @xmath0 are pseudo - anosov . in order to make this statement precise",
    ", we have to specify a way picking a `` random element '' of  @xmath0 .",
    "there are at least two standard methods for doing so , both involving the cayley graph  @xmath4 of  @xmath0 with respect to  @xmath3 .",
    "a first method is to perform a random walk in the cayley graph  @xmath4 of  @xmath0 , starting at the identity - vertex . in this framework ,",
    "the belief is that the probability of obtaining a pseudo - anosov element tends ( exponentially quickly ) to  @xmath5 as the length of the random walk tends to infinity .",
    "this belief has been proven to be correct , and it has been generalised far beyond the realm of mapping class groups , in @xcite .    for the second method , consider the ball @xmath6 in  @xmath4 of radius @xmath7 and centered on the identity vertex @xmath5 .",
    "the belief now is that the proportion of pseudo - anosov elements among the vertices in this ball tends to  @xmath5 as the radius tends to infinity : @xmath8 this statement remains a conjecture despite some progress in  @xcite .",
    "our main result is    [ c : main ] @xmath9    our proof is actually very easy , and it uses only well - known ingredients  notably , a classical theorem of albert fathi  @xcite , and the acylindrical hyperbolicity of the mapping class group action on the curve complex  @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems likely that corollary  [ c : main ] , and our proof , is well - known to some experts .",
    "however , we have not been able to locate it in the literature , and believe it deserves to be written down .",
    "we will deduce corollary  [ c : main ] from the following , which is our main technical result :    [ t : main ] there exists a finite subset  @xmath10 of  @xmath0 such that for any element @xmath11 of  @xmath0 , at least one of the mapping classes in @xmath12 is pseudo - anosov .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ t : main ] *  in what follows , by a _ curve _ we always mean an isotopy class of simple closed curves .",
    "we start by recalling the result from  @xcite  :    [ t : fathi ] if @xmath13 and if @xmath14 is a simple closed curve on  @xmath1 such that the curves @xmath15 together fill  @xmath1 , then @xmath16 is always pseudo - anosov , except for at most seven consecutive values of  @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 denotes the dehn twist along the curve  @xmath14 ) .",
    "in particular , either @xmath11 or @xmath19 ( or both ) are pseudo - anosov .",
    "[ l : ab ] there are two curves @xmath20 in @xmath1 such that for all but finitely many elements @xmath11 of  @xmath0 , either @xmath21 and  @xmath22 together fill  @xmath1 , or @xmath23 and @xmath24 together fill  @xmath1 ( or both ) .",
    "* proof of lemma  [ l : ab ] * recall that two curves together fill @xmath1 if and only if , in the curve complex @xmath25 , they are at distance @xmath26 .",
    "next we recall a fundamental result due to bowditch @xcite : the mapping class group  @xmath0 acts _ acylindrically _ on the curve complex , i.e. , for any @xmath27 , there exist @xmath28 so that for any two vertices @xmath21 , @xmath23 of the curve complex with @xmath29 there are at most @xmath30 distinct elements @xmath11 of @xmath0 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we shall apply this result in the case  @xmath33 .",
    "we simply choose arbitrarily two curves @xmath21 and @xmath23 in  @xmath1 , the only restriction being that @xmath34 .",
    "bowditch s result says that for all but finitely many ( at most  @xmath35 ) elements  @xmath11 of  @xmath0 , the action of  @xmath11 on the curve complex displaces least one of the two vertices , @xmath21 or  @xmath23 , by at least  @xmath36 .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma  [ l : ab ] .",
    "@xmath37    now we define @xmath38 .",
    "fathi s theorem and lemma  [ l : ab ] together imply the following : for every element @xmath11 of  @xmath0 , apart from the finitely many exceptional ones , at least one of the mapping classes in @xmath39 is pseudo - anosov .",
    "now we have to deal with the finitely many exceptional elements of  @xmath0 , say @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . for each @xmath42",
    ", we choose one @xmath43 such that @xmath44 is not an exceptional element .",
    "then for every  @xmath45 , at least one of the mapping classes in @xmath46 is pseudo - anosov .",
    "thus we have completed the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] , with @xmath47    * proof of corollary  [ c : main ] *  let @xmath48 .",
    "theorem  [ t : main ] tells us that the union of all the balls of radius  @xmath49 centered on the pseudo - anosov vertices of  @xmath4 is the whole cayley graph  @xmath4 .",
    "now for @xmath50 , the centers of the balls of radius  @xmath49 covering @xmath51 have to lie in @xmath6 .",
    "thus the union of the balls of radius  @xmath49 around the pseudo - anosov vertices of  @xmath6 contains @xmath51 .",
    "we obtain @xmath52 and hence @xmath53 both factors can be bounded below independently of  @xmath7 . indeed , since all vertices of  @xmath4 are of valence at most  @xmath54 , we have the very rough estimate @xmath55 thus the @xmath56 studied in corollary  [ c : main ] is at least @xmath57 . @xmath37    [ r : altproof ] after a first version of this paper appeared as a preprint , mladen bestvina kindly pointed out to us that there is a completely different proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "this proof has the virtue of also applying to other contexts , notably to proving that fully irreducible elements have positive density in  @xmath58 .",
    "the key is the existence  @xcite of homogeneous quasi - morphisms @xmath59 which are unbounded , but so that @xmath60 is uniformly bounded by some constant  @xmath61 on all reducible and periodic elements .",
    "now simply fix some quasi - morphism  @xmath62 , and some element @xmath63 of  @xmath0 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 denotes the defect of  @xmath62 ) .",
    "then for any @xmath13 , either @xmath67 or @xmath68 is pseudo - anosov . for details in the @xmath58-context",
    "see  @xcite , particularly remark  4.33 .",
    "throughout this section , we take @xmath69 to be a subgroup of @xmath0 , and we take @xmath70 to be the cayley graph of  @xmath69 with respect to any fixed finite generating set",
    ". we shall be interested in the case when @xmath69 satisfies the following condition :            * if @xmath69 is a finite index subgroup of  @xmath0 , or * if @xmath69 is the torelli group  see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "note that the torelli group contains in particular all dehn twists along separating curves of  @xmath1 , or * if @xmath69 is any finite index subgroup of the torelli group .",
    "[ t : mainsubgroups ] suppose @xmath69 is a subgroup of @xmath0 , the mapping class group of  @xmath1 , satisfying condition  @xmath71 above .",
    "then pseudo - anosovs have positive density in  @xmath69 : there exists a finite subset @xmath10 of  @xmath69 such that for any element @xmath11 of  @xmath69 , at least one of the mapping classes in @xmath12 is pseudo - anosov .",
    "moreover , @xmath77    the proof follows very closely the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "this time we choose the vertices @xmath21 and @xmath23 of  @xmath1 , as well as integers @xmath78 and @xmath79 according to condition  @xmath71 .",
    "possibly after replacing @xmath78 and @xmath79 by integer multiples of themselves , we can assume moreover that @xmath80 .",
    "defining @xmath81 , fathi s theorem and lemma  [ l : ab ] now imply : for every element @xmath11 of  @xmath69 , apart from the finitely many exceptional ones , at least one of the mapping classes in @xmath39 is pseudo - anosov .    for each exceptional element @xmath82",
    ", we choose one @xmath83 such that @xmath84 is non - exceptional .",
    "now with the exact same argument as in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] we have : for every @xmath85 , at least one of the mapping classes in @xmath86 is pseudo - anosov , with @xmath87 finally , the deduction that the limit inferior of the proportion of pseudo - anosov elements in large balls in the cayley graph of  @xmath69 is strictly positive works literally as the proof of corollary  [ c : main ] , just replacing @xmath0 by  @xmath69 and @xmath4 by  @xmath88 throughout .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] did not use the full strength of bowditch s theorem  @xcite  knowing that there exists one element of  @xmath0 which acts in a weakly propertly discontinuous ( wpd ) manner on the curve complex @xcite was more than sufficient .",
    "however , for our proof of theorem  [ t : mainsubgroups ] , bowditch s theorem is needed almost in its full strength .",
