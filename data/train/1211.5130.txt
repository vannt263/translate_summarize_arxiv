    "<S> dielectric relaxation has been investigated within the framework of a modified mean field theory , in which the dielectric response of an arbitrary condensed matter system to the applied electric field is assumed to consist of two parts , a collective response and a slowly fluctuating response ; the former corresponds to the cooperative response of the crystalline or noncrystalline structures composed of the atoms or molecules held together by normal chemical bonds and the latter represents the slow response of the strongly correlated high - temperature structure precursors or a partially ordered nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> these two dielectric responses are not independent of each other but rather constitute a dynamic hierarchy , in which the slowly fluctuating response is constrained by the collective response . </S>",
    "<S> it then becomes clear that the dielectric relaxation of the system is actually a specific characteristic relaxation process modulated by the slow relaxation of the nematic phase and its corresponding relaxation relationship should be regarded as the universal dielectric relaxation law . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that seemingly different relaxation relationships , such as the debye relaxation law , the cole - cole equation , the cole - davidson equation , the havriliak - negami relaxation , the kohlrausch - williams - watts function , jonscher s universal dielectric relaxation law , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , are only variants of this universal law under certain circumstances .    in 1913 , debye investigated the anomalous dispersion phenomenon , in which the index of refraction falls with the angular frequency of electromagnetic waves , of a group of dipolar molecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he treated a dipolar molecule of the group as a sphere immersed in a viscous fluid ; under the assumption that the only electric field acting on the molecule is the external field , he used einstein s theory of the brownian motion @xcite to tackle the collisions between the molecule and its neighboring molecules in the liquid and then studied the dielectric dispersion of the group . </S>",
    "<S> eventually he formulated the following equation @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the complex permittivity of the group of dipolar molecules and @xmath2 is the angular frequency of the external electric field ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the permittivity at the high frequency limit and the static permittivity of the group , respectively ; @xmath5 is the characteristic relaxation time of the group . </S>",
    "<S> the above equation is often called the debye relaxation law , which represents the dielectric response of rotational dipolar molecules to an alternating external electric field .    </S>",
    "<S> dielectric relaxation phenomena had been extensively investigated long before the debye relaxation law was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , kohlrausch introduced the stretched exponential function ( it is now also called the kohlrausch function ) to describe the charge relaxation phenomenon in leiden jars in 1854 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the debye relaxation law might be the first relaxation relationship derived based on statistical mechanics ; thus it has been often used as the starting point for investigating relaxation responses of dielectrics . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that the relaxation behavior of a wide range of dielectric materials deviates strongly from the debye relaxation law . over the past 100 years </S>",
    "<S> , many empirical relaxation laws or relationships , which can be regarded as variants of the debye relaxation law , have been developed . among the most important are the cole - cole equation ( 1941 - 1942 ) @xcite , the cole - davidson equation ( 1950 - 1951 ) @xcite , the havriliak - negami equation ( 1966 - 1967 ) @xcite , the kohlrausch - williams - watts function ( the fourier transform of the kohlrausch function ) ( 1970 ) @xcite , etc . in practice , these empirical relationships work well for certain materials under specific conditions , but not for others .    in 1970s , </S>",
    "<S> jonscher and his co - workers analyzed dielectric properties of many insulating and semiconducting materials ; he then suggested that there exists a universal law of dielectric responses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> jonscher s work further stimulated scientific curiosity to explore the physical mechanism underlying the universal relaxation phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> it is now well known that relaxation phenomena characterized by different physical quantities , such as strain , permittivity , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , are very similar in different materials and most relaxation data can be interpreted by two types of experimental fitting functions : the kohlrausch function , which is written below @xcite @xmath6 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{$0<\\beta<1 $ } \\label{stretchedfunction0}\\ ] ] or the jonscher function given below @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents time in seconds ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are assumed to be constant values for a given material .        despite having certain  _ universal _ \" relationships , such as the above - mentioned two fitting functions , to describe similar relaxation phenomena in different condensed matter systems , their origins are not entirely clear yet @xcite . in this letter , we will attempt to explore the physical mechanism underlying dielectric relaxation phenomena and give a unified interpretation of general relaxation phenomena </S>",
    "<S> . we would like to make the conjecture that , if the universal relaxation law does exist , its corresponding mathematical expressions might involve some kinds of  _ order parameters _ \" just like the ones employed in the landau theory of phase transitions . to make our reasoning and derivation , which will be presented in this letter , more easily understood , we would first discuss the landau theory and the landau - khalatnikov equation in the text that follows .    in 1937 , landau proposed the concept of broken symmetry to explain the ferromagnetic phase transition ; he argued that the paramagnetic phase possesses a high degree of symmetry whereas the ferromagnetic phase has a low one ; therefore , the phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism must involve the occurrence of broken symmetry at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> landau introduced the _ order parameter _ , a unique thermodynamic variable , to demonstrate his broken symmetry concept @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the ferromagnetic phase transition , the order parameter is defined as the spontaneous magnetization @xmath12 . according to landau s idea </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath12 has the following values : @xmath13 , which corresponds to the high degree of symmetry , if the considered material is in the paramagnetic state and @xmath14 , which corresponds to the low one , if it is in the ferromagnetic state . in the absence of the external magnetic field and in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the landau free energy @xmath16 per unit volume up to the fourth order of @xmath12 can be written as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the free energy that is independent of @xmath12 ; both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are coefficients .    in 1954 , landau and khalatnikov investigated the relaxation behavior of @xmath12 and formulated the following equation @xcite , which is now often called the landau - khalatnikov equation . @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a kinetic coefficient , which is believed to be independent of temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the landau - khalatnikov equation was originally developed to describe the critical slowing down of fluctuation of the order parameter on approaching the critical point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this equation has a more profound physical significance ; it can be interpreted as the law of conservation of energy in relaxation processes , i.e. , the kinetic energy associated with fluctuation of the order parameter and dissipated during the corresponding relaxation process is equal to the decrease in the landau free energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this equation can be exploited to analyze the relaxation behavior of the order parameter in general cases .     and </S>",
    "<S> above temperature @xmath23 , there is no cooperative movement in htsps ; between @xmath24 and @xmath23 , htsps become strongly correlated and form a nematic phase . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now start to explore whether the universal dielectric relaxation law exists or not . our conjecture can be further restated as finding a set of fundamental equations , if we do have such a universal law , that can be exploited to derive all of the aforementioned relaxation laws and fitting functions . as usual , we start with the debye relaxation law . it is generally believed that neglecting mutual interactions between dipolar molecules and their neighboring molecules is the reason that makes the debye relaxation law deviate from many experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the debye relaxation law , however , is the model based on statistical mechanics , which is closely related to the einstein theory of the brownian motion and the smoluchowski equation @xcite ; like collisions between dipolar molecules and their neighboring molecules , mutual interactions have been implicitly considered in debye s model and the corresponding induced dipole moments have been assumed to be stochastic in the time domain and randomly distributed in the spatial domain so that the net influence of such mutual interactions is zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in our opinion , the common belief regarding the debye relaxation law might not be appropriate in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> it will become clear later that there exists a specific kind of mutual interactions and its net influence is not zero , which renders the debye relaxation law inaccurate ; the induced dipole moments associated with this mutual interaction are neither purely stochastic in the time domain nor randomly distributed in the spatial domain and their cooperative behavior would eventually alter the dielectric relaxation of a condensed matter system under the perturbation of external electric fields . in the following discussion , for simplicity , we will first consider such mutual interaction in paraelectric perovskites and then extend our conclusion to general dielectric materials .    for a crystalline perovskite , it should have a purely ordered state at the temperature very close to absolute zero and a completely disordered state at its melting point ; at temperatures between those two extremes , however , the material must have both ordered and disordered states and the formation of the latter is mainly due to thermal fluctuations ( at temperatures near absolute zero , the formation of the disordered state might be determined by the co - operative jahn - teller effect @xcite ) . let us consider a perovskite lattice diagrammatically shown in figs . [ 1a]-[1c ] . at temperatures far below the melting point </S>",
    "<S> , there always exists the probability that certain atoms in the normal lattice shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 1a ] could gain extra kinetic energy from thermal fluctuations to move quasi - permanently away from their original equilibrium positions and distort the original lattice as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 1b ] and [ 1c ] . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of distortion can introduce the local non - uniform deformation , which breaks the inversion symmetry and induces dipole moments even in paraelectric ( non - polar ) perovskites @xcite . for simplicity , we define the local disordered structures corresponding to such distorted crystal lattice as high - temperature structure precursors ( htsps ) . at new equilibrium positions , </S>",
    "<S> htsps possess the higher potential due to the induced local strain energy ; thus they are often metastable . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 1b ] and [ 1c ] , these htsps have an equal probability of occurring at different locations ( if thermal fluctuations occur randomly ) and can be switched from one to the other in either direction under thermal fluctuations ; they could also disappear or even  </S>",
    "<S> _ hop _ \" to other locations under external perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the net influence of htsps can be neglected if they behave independently since , under this condition , htsps are randomly distributed in the spatial domain and their movements are stochastic in the time domain so that their net effect can be completely averaged out . </S>",
    "<S> however , if htsps behave cooperatively , the situation could be quite different . since the formation of htsps </S>",
    "<S> is closely linked to thermal fluctuations , the quantity of htsps is thus dependent upon temperature ; as temperature rises , the quantity also increases . at a certain temperature @xmath24 , the quantity of htsps has been raised and reached a threshold or the effective distance between individual htsps has been reduced below a critical value so that htsps could start to interact with each other , which can be regarded as their cooperative or self - organization behavior , and then form a unique nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of structural transformation must be regarded as an intrinsic physical phenomenon and the driving force behind it is the competition between energy and entropy . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a crystalline perovskite containing htsps ; its gibbs free energy in the absence of external electric fields can be written as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the internal energy @xmath26 will increase due to the increment of the local strain energy and the electric potential generated by htsps shown in fig . 1 ( b ) or ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> if temperature @xmath27 remains unchanged or changes slowly , the entropy @xmath28 must rise to reduce @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way to increase @xmath28 is that the chemical bonds between the atoms on the distorted lattice sites are partially broken so that the corresponding htsps could gain more freedom to rotate and then are oriented along local preferred directions to form a nematic phase , which leads to a decrease in the orientational entropy but an increase in the positional entropy and , eventually , results in a net increase in the total entropy in the considered material . in addition , since the nematic phase has a cylindrical symmetry @xmath30 ( no polarity ) @xcite , the generated electric energy associated with the distorted lattice shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( b ) or ( c ) will decrease when the phase is formed so that @xmath29 could be further reduced in the considered material . </S>",
    "<S> if using @xmath31 to represent the local preferred direction and approximately treating individual htsps as molecules , we can define the orientational order parameter , @xmath32 , of the nematic phase as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined as the given preferred direction of the disordered structure located at the position @xmath35 and @xmath36 is usually called the director that represents the particular direction of the nematic phase ; @xmath37 represents the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath36 at the position @xmath35 ; @xmath38 is the mathematical symbol for average . </S>",
    "<S> the above - mentioned nematic phase only exists when @xmath39 and , under this condition , all htsps behave like a partially ordered liquid . </S>",
    "<S> there are two special cases associated with this order parameter : ( 1 ) @xmath40 corresponds to an ideal situation , in which all htsps are perfectly aligned along @xmath36 ; ( 2 ) if temperature continues to rise , at a certain point @xmath41 , although the quantity of htsps will continue to increase , any cooperative movement of htsps will be destroyed by high - temperature thermal perturbation , which makes htsps randomly oriented and then renders @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when @xmath43 , all htsps behave like a normal liquid , in which individual htsps are randomly aligned and there is no preferred direction for their orientation . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the cooperative behavior of htsps is shown schematically in fig . [ 2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now summarize what we have done so far : ( 1 ) we first addressed the formation of htsps in crystalline dielectrics , which is mainly caused by thermal fluctuations ; ( 2 ) as temperature rises , the quantity of htsps increases and then the effective distance between individual htsps decreases . at a certain point </S>",
    "<S> , htsps start to become strongly correlated and form a nematic phase to reduce the gibbs free energy of the considered material . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that htsps become strongly correlated at the cost of the chemical bonds between certain atoms of htsps , which are partially broken during the formation of the nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this concept can be easily generalized to polycrystalline and amorphous dielectric materials since the formation of the strongly correlated htsps is not dependent on whether material structures are crystalline or not but greatly determined by whether the corresponding chemical bonds are partially broken or not . if considering an amorphous dielectric material , for instance , we can treat it as an effective crystalline material by assuming that it has a crystalline structure with an infinitely long spatial period ; then the above - mentioned nematic phase can be formed inside this material for the same reason . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the only difference between a purely crystalline dielectric and an amorphous dielectric is that the disordered structures are mainly induced by thermal fluctuations in the former , as shown in fig . 1 ( b ) or ( c ) , but partially linked to thermal fluctuations in the latter since there are often a large number of inherent disordered structures existing in amorphous materials even at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our derivation and conclusion drawn from crystalline dielectrics are equally applicable to polycrystalline and amorphous dielectric materials . here </S>",
    "<S> it might be worth briefly discussing the critical temperature @xmath24 in both crystalline and amorphous dielectrics . from the above discussion </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath24 is determined by the quantity of htsps that rises above a certain level in the considered material . for a crystalline dielectric </S>",
    "<S> , we can find its @xmath24 via , for instance , measuring the abrupt change of its refraction index ; if somehow we could change the crystalline phase of the dielectric to an amorphous one and then measure its @xmath24 , we should be able to observe a reduced value of @xmath24 due to the existence of inherent disordered structures of the amorphous phase . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , compared with crystalline dielectrics , the strongly correlated htsps could emerge in amorphous dielectrics at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion may have a profound significance that could be used to clarify the nature of the so - called kauzmann s paradox @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further discussion on this topic is omitted in this letter and will be given elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> it is also necessary to add some words on the dynamic behavior of the strongly correlated htsps or the nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the symmetry group of the nematic phase is the continuous rotation group , thus it has uncountable continuum of symmetry elements , which means that its relaxation could be extremely slow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it might be interesting to simply compare the dynamic behavior of such a phase with that of glassy materials . </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , the relaxation of glassy materials is also extremely slow ( to be more precise , the relaxation of glassy materials should be slower than that of the nematic phase since there are more disordered structures involved in the former ) and their responses , as ensembles of the movement of atoms , to external perturbations are direct . </S>",
    "<S> however , the situation of the nematic phase is different ; its response to external fields is not directly related to the movement of atoms but largely dependent upon the cooperative movement of htsps . when the considered dielectric material is placed under an external field </S>",
    "<S> , its equilibrium state will shift from the original one to a new one . </S>",
    "<S> at the new equilibrium state , the strongly correlated htsps will cooperatively re - adjust themselves and form a new nematic phase to keep the gibbs free energy to a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dynamics of the nematic phase should be very slow but is different from that of glassy materials .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the dynamic behavior of the nematic phase of the considered dielectric material under electric fields . in this letter , we assume that the considered material is a dielectric with the simple cubic structure or an amorphous dielectric so that its electric polarization @xmath44 and electric displacement @xmath45 can be approximately treated as scalar quantities to simplify our further derivation and discussion . if an ac signal is applied to the considered material , the electric polarization will be induced in its crystalline phases ( for crystalline and polycrystalline materials ) or other microscopic structures ( for amorphous materials ) , in which the corresponding atoms or molecules are held together by normal chemical bonds , and its nematic phase , respectively ; the induced polarization in the former case is denoted by @xmath44 and the one in the latter case by @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the formed polarization consists of two parts : @xmath44 at the normal energy level corresponding to the solid state and @xmath46 at the higher energy level corresponding to the partially ordered liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the effective polarization inside the considered material could be represented by either of the following two combinations : ( a ) @xmath47 or ( b ) @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a dimensionless coefficient .    in the above - mentioned first case , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between @xmath44 and @xmath46 is neglected ; thus , @xmath52 is simply regarded as the superposition of @xmath44 and @xmath46 . in the above - mentioned second case , however , the interaction between @xmath44 and @xmath46 can not be neglected . since </S>",
    "<S> the correlated htsps are usually metastable , they can be easily disturbed by the polarization field associated with @xmath44 . according to le chatelier s principle </S>",
    "<S> , the nematic phase would then undergo a specific structural change to counteract any imposed change by the field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the effective polarization is defined as @xmath53 in this case ; here the negative sign is due to le chatelier s principle . </S>",
    "<S> the gibbs free energy per unit volume of the considered material can then be written as @xmath54 which corresponds to the first case , @xmath55 ; @xmath56 which corresponds to the second case , @xmath53 ; here @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the electric permittivity of free space and the relative permittivity , respectively ; @xmath59 is defined as the electric susceptibility ; @xmath60 is the applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of @xmath49 can be interpreted as follows : it actually represents , in the statistical sense , the fraction of the total potential , which is generated by the cooperative movement of htsps . for continuous phase transitions , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical limit for the value of @xmath49 is @xmath61 near the critical point @xcite ; for dielectric relaxation studies , @xmath49 is determined by the number of perturbations of external electric fields and may vary from 0 to 1 in different materials , which will be explained in detail later in this letter .    , </S>",
    "<S> which is represented by vertical arrows ; here @xmath62 is the period . ]    in the above equations , we have introduced a generalized order parameter , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , to define the framework of a modified mean field theory , in which two distinct polarization quantities , @xmath44 and @xmath46 , are used to represent the effective response of the considered material to the applied electric field . in conventional mean field theories , the response of the considered material to external perturbations ( e.g. , temperature , magnetic field , electric field , etc . ) is assumed to be an average value ; the mutual interactions between individual microscopic particles or structures due to thermal fluctuations in the material are assumed to be randomly distributed in the spatial domain and take place stochastically in the time domain so that the net result of such mutual interactions is zero and can be neglected . in our modified mean field theory , however , such mutual interactions are not treated as random variables but the response of a partially ordered liquid - like phase ( nematic phase ) ; in other words , htsps become strongly correlated due to such mutual interactions . </S>",
    "<S> since the nematic phase possesses a global symmetry , its response to the applied electric field can be integrated into the gibbs free energy given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dielectricgibbs1 ] ) and ( [ dielectricgibbs2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , there is no landau s broken symmetry concept directly involved in this modified mean field theory ; nevertheless , the relaxation of the generalized order parameter can still be investigated via the following equation @xmath65 this equation is the modified landau - khalatnikov equation and can be interpreted as follows : the kinetic energy associated with the dynamics of the generalized order parameter and dissipated during the corresponding relaxation process is equal to the decrease in the gibbs free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between this equation ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ modifiedlk2012a ] ) ) and the landau - khalatnikov equation ( eq . ( [ lk1954 ] ) ) is that there is a negative sign in the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lk1954 ] ) but none in that of eq . </S>",

    "<S> roughly speaking , if the duration , @xmath77 , and the amplitude of the testing signal are fixed , the higher the frequency , the larger the value of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion can be used to explain why the cole - cole equation requires that the frequency of the testing signal should be low . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a dielectric material having a small @xmath49 value in the absence of external electric fields ; after exposed to an applied electric field , if the material still has a small @xmath49 value , then we can safely say that the frequency of the field should be low , which is the case of the cole - cole equation discussed in case i ( b ) .    in the above discussion , we only consider changes of the value of @xmath49 and the volume of the nematic phase when the considered material is exposed to an external field . </S>",
    "<S> such changes are illustrated by fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 5 ] ; before and after exposed to the field , the nematic phase will undergo a structural transformation shown diagrammatically in figs . [ 5a ] and [ 5b ] . when the field is removed , a reverse structural transformation from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 5b ] to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 5a ] in the nematic phase must take place to restore the original equilibrium state , i.e. , both @xmath49 and the nematic phase will relax to their previous value and volume . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have to emphasize that any material relaxation must involve certain fatigue behavior . in our studies , however , the fatigue behavior in dielectric relaxation is neglected ; this is because , in practice , the duration of the testing signal is limited and its amplitude is weak .     before and after the dielectric loss peak : ( a ) @xmath191 before the peak and ( b ) @xmath192 after the peak ; here @xmath81 is the frequency of the applied electric field ; @xmath193 and @xmath194 represent the frequency value and the imaginary susceptibility at the loss peak ; @xmath195 is the value of @xmath49 at the loss peak ; @xmath196 is defined as the theoretical limit of @xmath49 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to point out that the strongly correlated htsps could also significantly alter the second order phase transition behavior @xcite . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath49 has a different physical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a crystalline ferroelectric material ; at its critical point @xmath15 , the old phase collapses but the new phase has not been formed so that the material must be in a completely disordered state . </S>",
    "<S> this means @xmath197 at the critical point since , in practice , @xmath198 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at a certain point near @xmath15 , in the considered material , 50% of its atoms are in the ordered solid state and the other 50% are in the partially ordered liquid state , which corresponds to @xmath199 . in the statistical sense , @xmath199 represents a specific thermodynamic limit ; below this limit ( @xmath200 ) , the material is believed still being a continuum ; above this limit ( @xmath201 ) , the material can not be regarded as a continuum anymore . </S>",
    "<S> so the value of @xmath49 must be less than 0.5 in second order phase transitions @xcite .    in dielectric relaxation studies </S>",
    "<S> , however , there is no dramatic structural change involved . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath49 is by no means linked to the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> to some extent , @xmath49 represents the fraction of the total effective polarization , which is contributed by the nematic phase , negative or positive , of the considered material . from the previous discussion , we know that the atomic structural distortion associated with the polarization process of the normal structures will disturb the nematic phase when the considered material is placed under an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nematic phase , according to le chatelier s principle , must undergo a structural change , in which the correlated htsps will be aggregated and the volume of the nematic phase will increase as shown schematically in fig . [ 5 ] , to counteract this perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the enlarged nematic phase , in turn , will jam the normal structures and try to prevent the further distortion from occurring , or try to hinder the polarization process of the normal structures . in order to complete the polarization process </S>",
    "<S> , the considered material needs more energy to overcome the counteractive response of the nematic phase , which , of course , will introduce extra dielectric relaxation loss . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the generalized order parameter should be @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the polarization process of the normal structures does not always guarantee being able to perturb the nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> if the frequency of the testing signal is high , on the one hand , the polarization , especially the orientational polarization , of the normal structures could be significantly reduced because the collective atomic movement or dipole rotation in the considered material might not be able to fully keep pace with the change of the testing signal ; on the other hand , the volume of the nematic phase will further increase since it is proportional to the cycle number n or the frequency of the testing signal when the corresponding signal duration @xmath77 is fixed . thus , there must exist a critical volume for the nematic phase at a specific frequency , @xmath193 , beyond which the volume of the nematic phase will be too large to be disturbed . therefore , when the frequency of the testing signal is greater than @xmath193 , the nematic phase will not undergo further structural changes to counteract the perturbation exerted by the polarization process of the normal structures but will , independently , respond to the testing signal in the considered material ; therefore , the corresponding order parameter will be @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that , at @xmath193 , the dielectric relaxation loss will reach the maximum in the considered material ; this is partially because , on the high frequency side beyond @xmath193 , there will be no counteractive response from the nematic phase needed to be overcome in the polarization process of the normal structures . </S>",
    "<S> we here denote the value of @xmath49 at @xmath193 as @xmath195 for convenience .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , under the extreme condition where @xmath202 , the polarization of the normal structures will be significantly reduced whereas htsps could still be easily polarized even by high - frequency external fields because of their partially ordered liquid phase . under this situation , </S>",
    "<S> the effective polarization of the considered material might be dominated by the contribution from the nematic phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath49 might approach 1 when @xmath202 . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially the case with polymer materials , in which the orientational polarization dominates . </S>",
    "<S> we here use @xmath203 to represent the value of @xmath49 when @xmath202 and obtain @xmath164 . in the rest of this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will analyze dielectric relaxation phenomena under two situations , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the frequency of the testing signal ranges from the dc region ( @xmath206hz ) to the microwave region ( @xmath207hz ) ; under this experimental condition , we have @xmath208 in most cases ( because the theoretical limit of @xmath158 is @xmath209s ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ jonscherfunction0 ] ) .    in view of what have been derived and discussed above , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that what jonscher s universal dielectric relaxation law describes are just two special cases of the fundamental dielectric relaxation given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c2effectiverelaxationf ] ) , which could be greatly altered by the evolution of the volume of the nematic phase . on the low frequency side ( @xmath216 ) of the loss peak , </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the nematic phase is smaller than the critical volume and , thus , the relaxation follows the kohlrausch - williams - watts relaxation . on the high frequency side ( @xmath217 ) of the loss peak </S>",
    "<S> , however , the volume is larger than the critical volume and , thus , the relaxation follows the cole - davidson equation . </S>",
    "<S> this is why @xmath213 is asymmetric in a log @xmath2 plot for most dielectric materials . </S>",
    "<S> now it is also clear why the relaxation relationships defined by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ effectiverelaxationf ] ) and ( [ effectiverelaxationf1 ] ) , which are seemingly independent of external fields , could eventually evolve into the ones that are obviously field - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the real relaxation of an arbitrary dielectric material is always modulated by the slow relaxation of its nematic phase .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have only considered the relaxation behavior in the situation where temperature remains unchanged and the evolution of the nematic phase and the value of @xmath49 are completely determined by external electric fields . from our previous discussions , we know that , in the absence of external fields , the quantity of htsps and the formation of the nematic phase are directly related to temperature . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the value of @xmath49 is proportional to temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it should be interesting to think about the relaxation behavior in another situation where temperature is continuously changed and the testing signal is a fixed low - frequency perturbation of small amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the change of the nematic phase and @xmath49 in such a relaxation process is totally dependent on temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of temperature - dependent relaxation will be discussed in the text that follows .    </S>",
    "<S> case iv - in this case , the evolution of the nematic phase and the variation of @xmath49 are governed by temperature changes . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , there must exist a critical volume for the nematic phase at a specific temperature , @xmath267 ( @xmath268 ) ; when the testing temperature is above @xmath267 , the volume of the nematic phase will be too large to be disturbed by the polarization process of the normal structures in the considered material under the perturbation of the testing signal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , using the reasoning exploited in case iii , the generalized order parameter here can be defined as either @xmath53 when @xmath269 or @xmath55 when @xmath270 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can simply exploit the previous derivation to obtain the relaxation relationships on both sides of @xmath267 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> case iv ( a ) - the generalized order parameter is @xmath53 and @xmath269 . by taking advantage of the method used to derive eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ caseiiiaf ] ) and ( [ caseiiiat ] ) , we can write the effective relaxation relationships of case iv ( a ) as @xmath271 and @xmath272 \\ \\ \\ ( \\mbox{$t < t_{m}$ } ) , \\label{caseivat}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 varies from 0 to @xmath108 and @xmath160 is defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ks ] ) ; here @xmath273 is just used to denote the exponential function of case iv for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> these two equations indicate that , when @xmath269 , the corresponding dielectric relaxation behavior obeys the kohlrausch function ( the kohlrausch - williams - watts in the frequency domain ) .    </S>",
    "<S> case iv ( b ) - the generalized order parameter is @xmath55 and @xmath270 . similarly , by using the method exploited to derive eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ caseiiibf ] ) and ( [ caseiiibt ] ) , we can write the effective relaxation relationships of case iv ( b ) as @xmath274 and @xmath275 \\ \\ \\ ( \\mbox{$t > t_{m}$ } ) , \\label{caseivbt}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 varies from 0 to @xmath108 and @xmath93 is defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two equations demonstrate that , when @xmath270 , the corresponding dielectric relaxation behavior obeys the cole - davidson equation .    perhaps , the most distinguishing feature of relaxation processes of case iv is that , when @xmath269 , the corresponding relaxation is the stretched exponential function whereas , when @xmath270 , it becomes the compressed one in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> this feature might be extremely useful in phase transition and structural transformation studies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a jonscher s universal relaxation type law can also be derived in this case ; the only difference is that @xmath195 here has nothing to do with the frequency of the testing signal but is mainly governed by temperature and represents the value of @xmath49 at @xmath267 . </S>",
    "<S> however , compared with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ caseivaf]-[caseivbt ] ) , this kind of relaxation law can not provide more useful information about temperature - dependent relaxation phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> thus its derivation is omitted here .    </S>",
    "<S> it might be worth pointing out that , though drawn from dielectric relaxation , the derivation and the conclusions given here should apply equally to other relaxation phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for a solid material undergoing deformation , one can arrive at its structural relaxation formulas having the same mathematical expressions as the ones derived in this letter by assuming that the generalized order parameter is formed by its induced strain quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> concluding remarks - in this letter , we have demonstrated that , over a wide range of temperature , dielectric materials possess two microscopic structures , the normal structures , i.e. , the crystalline or noncrystalline structures composed of the atoms or molecules held together by normal chemical bonds , and the nematic phase ( the partially ordered liquid - like phase ) or the strongly correlated htsps . when a dielectric material is placed under an applied electric field </S>",
    "<S> , its normal structures will give a collective dielectric response at the normal energy level and its nematic phase will present a slowly fluctuating one at the higher energy level . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the normal structures and the nematic phase are not independent of each other . at absolute zero and in the absence of external fields , atomic movement is frozen and the nematic phase does not exist in the considered material . as temperature rises , </S>",
    "<S> the nematic phase starts to emerge due to thermal fluctuations ( or the co - operative jahn - teller effect at temperatures near absolute zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> now if we apply an electric field to the considered material , the volume of its nematic phase will increase , due to the perturbation of the field , at the cost of the volume of its normal structures ; the increase of the former corresponds to the decrease of the latter . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the nematic phase is constrained by the normal structures . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dielectric responses of the normal structures and the nematic phase constitute a dynamic hierarchy , in which the slowly fluctuating response is also constrained by the collective response . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there does exist a universal dielectric relaxation process , which is actually the characteristic relaxation of the normal structures modulated by the slow relaxation of the nematic phase in the considered material ; the corresponding relaxation relationship can then be regarded as the universal dielectric relaxation law and other relaxation relationships are only variants of this universal law under different situations .    * acknowledgment *    the research presented here was sponsored by the state university of new york at buffalo . </S>",
