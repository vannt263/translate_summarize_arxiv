    "the advantage of these relations with respect to ( [ f ] ) is that r - operation in ( [ f ] ) is taken at normalization point , and thus has more simple form .",
    "r - operation in ( [ f ] ) can be expressed in terms of product of @xmath44 operations , which removes all divergences from diagrams @xcite @xmath45 where product is taken over all relevant ( uv - divergent ) subgraphs of a particular diagram , including diagram as whole .",
    "differentiation of diagram lines in ( [ f ] ) with respect to squared mass ( @xmath46 ) is equivalent to insertion of unit vertex into a line ( `` dot insertion '' ) .",

    "it is more convenient to use feynman parameters @xmath79 .",
    "it is well known that it is possible to write integrand in feynman representation directly from diagram ( without necessity of writing momentum representation ) , it turns out that it may be extended to integrands of type ( [ i2a ] ) with streching parameters .",

    "zero at @xmath82 will produce a pole on @xmath4 .",
    "but after differentiation over @xmath73 we got the following expression : @xmath83 one can see that this singularity becomes integrable and it is possible to calculate this integral as taylor series on @xmath4 .",

    "this allows us to calculate anomalous dimensions at 5th order of perturbation theory .",
    "for more precise check of the results obtained in @xcite we performed diagram - by - diagram comparison of our results and results of @xcite . to perform diagram - by - diagram comparison from values calculated in np scheme we need to construct counterterm contributions in ms scheme . because of the fact that in np scheme we calculate only finite parts of diagrams ( [ f ] ) ,",
    "first of all we need to construct counterterms in np scheme , and then recalculate them from np scheme to ms one .",
    "the first problem ( construction of counterterms in np scheme ) can be solved using representation for couterterms obtained in @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85  number of loops , @xmath86 , and the second term is defined by sum of diagrams from lower orders of perturbation theory ( this reflects the fact that all high order poles can be expressed in terms of lower order diagrams ) .",
    "the next step is recalculation of counterterms from np scheme to ms one .",
    "it can be performed using so called @xmath87 operation @xcite .",
    "this operation allows one to recursively recalculate counterterms from one renormalization scheme to another ( without necessity of calculation of diagrams ) .    we ve performed recalculation of our results to ms scheme and found that results are in good agreement with @xcite : all diagrams coincides with at least @xmath88 accuracy",
