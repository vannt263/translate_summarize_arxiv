    "particle distributions in high energy collisions are frequently found to be of negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) form for both total multiplicities and multiplicities in finite pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "one satisfactory explanation of this observation is that particle are produced via cascade process , and such interpretation leads to the development of clan concept of clustering in particle production  @xcite .",
    "let s recall the negative binomial probability density function , f(n)= k+n-1 n(1-p)^n p^k , [ eq : negbinom ] where @xmath0 $ ] , and the real number @xmath1 . its mean and variance are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in order to interpret the wide occurrence of nbd",
    ", a parameterization alternative to the standard nbd parameterization has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "it consists of the average number of groups of particles of common ancestor , also called the average number of clans , |n = k ( 1 + ) , [ eq : meann ] and the average number of particles per clan , |n_c=. with this set of parameterization , particle production can be regarded as an independent production of clans followed by the decay of clans into particles according to a logarithmic multiplicity distribution .",
    "this can be seen by investigating the generating functions of relevant distributions .",
    "the generating function for the logarithmic distribution is , g_(x ) = , where @xmath4 is set to be @xmath5 .",
    "because clans are independently produced , they can be described by poisson distribution , for which the generating function is g_(x ) = e^|n(x-1 ) . the final distribution is a compound distribution of logarithm and poisson , for which the generating function is given by g _ & = & g_(g_(x ) ) + & = & e^|n(g_(x)-1 ) + & = & ( ) ^k , by which we have recovered the generating function of nbd .",
    "note that with the introduction of the clan concept , the nbd , if arranged properly , yields a similarity to the grand - canonical partition function . such analogy led to the development of clan thermodynamics  @xcite . here , adopting the concept of clan does not necessarily imply the endorsement of clan thermodynamics .",
    "the clan parameters have been used to identify abnormalities due to phase transition  @xcite . for a similar purpose ,",
    "this study is to examine the averaged charged multiplicity per clan as a function of collision energy .",
    "the data set consist of minimum bias events of au+au collisions at = 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev , taken by the star experiment .",
    "total events used in this analysis are , from the lowest energy to the highest one , 5 , 7 , 40 , 71 , 56 , 73 , and 25 million , respectively .",
    "events from energies lower than 62.4 gev were taken as part of the beam energy scan program  @xcite at rhic , and events from 62.4 and 200 gev were taken in year 2010 .",
    "all events are required to have at least one time of flight  @xcite hit matching to a track , a vertex within 30 centimeters to the center of star s time projection chamber  @xcite in z direction , and within 2 centimeters to the beam in transverse direction . to avoid complications arising from having more than one collisions in the time window of detector readout , which usually happens when the luminosity is high ,",
    "events from 62.4 gev and 200 gev are selected from those taken with low luminosity beam ( beam beam counter coincidence rate less than 25k ) .",
    "tracks are required to have a minimum of 15 hits , and the ratio of number of hits to number of maximum possible hits to be greater than 0.52 .",
    "the distance of the closest approach ( dca ) of a track to the primary vertex is required to be less than 1 centimeter . to avoid auto correlation ,",
    "particles used in the study of multiplicity distribution and those used in the centrality definition are taken from different pseudorapidity ranges , which is @xmath6 for the former and @xmath7 for the latter . in this paper",
    "the multiplicity in the latter is also called  reference - multiplicity-2 \" to distinguish itself from the usual reference multiplicity defined with particles in @xmath6 . in the picture of particles being produced by clans , one is interested in produced particles only . thus protons are removed in this study , because they are contaminated by transported ones which can introduce trivial energy dependence , in particular at low energies where transported protons become dominant .",
    "the removal of protons is achieved by requiring tracks energy loss per unit length ( @xmath8 ) to be larger than a threshold set to 2 standard deviations below the theoretically expected value for protons at the same rigidity .",
    "for events with a given reference - multiplicity-2 , the corresponding multiplicity distribution in @xmath6 can be well described by nbd .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : nbd_data ] , in which the multiplicity distribution in @xmath6 is plotted for a selected set of reference - multiplicity-2 numbers .",
    "the curves are fits to the nbd and they describe the data very well .    from left to right , the multiplicity distribution in @xmath6 for reference - multiplicity-2 = 11 , 18 , 30 , 48 , 76 , 116 , 169 , 242 and 289 , respectively .",
    "curves are fits to nbd .",
    "all histograms are for au+au collisions at = 27 gev . ]",
    "the fit is applied to multiplicity distributions with the finest bin of reference - multiplicity-2 , and the corresponding @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be obtained . with both @xmath9 and @xmath10 known ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 can be calculated with the transformation mentioned above . in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fitpar_refmult2 ] , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are plotted as a function of reference - multiplicity-2 , and in the bottom panel , the average multiplicity for charged particles per clan ( @xmath12 ) is shown .",
    "note that @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be calculated with either directly calculated @xmath9 and @xmath10 , shown by black symbols , or that from fitting the nbd , shown by non - black symbols .",
    "the two sets of results agree with each other well and in the follow - up analysis only the set based on fitting nbd is used , because fitting is less sensitive to contaminations from rare events with abnormally large or small multiplicity . in general @xmath9",
    "is found to be greater than @xmath10 which is a feature of nbd . with decreasing centrality ( increasing reference - multiplicity-2 ) ,",
    "@xmath11 keep increasing while @xmath12 shows a moderate decrease towards unit , which means that particle production is approaching the limit of independent production ( poisson ) in central collisions .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( top panel ) and @xmath12 ( bottom panel ) as a function of reference - multiplicity-2 for au+au collisions at = 27 gev .",
    "see text for details . ]    the obtained @xmath11 and @xmath12 are then averaged over reference - multiplicity-2 for each centrality bin , of which the boundaries are shown by mesh area in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fitpar_refmult2 ] .",
    "note by performing the analysis with the finest reference - multiplicity-2 bin , one avoids the additional fluctuation from a wide multiplicity bin which can significantly bias the variance .",

    "average charged particles per clan @xmath12 as a function of collision energy , for various centrality classes .",
    "boxes represents systematic error resulted from variations in star s day - to - day operation during data - taking . ]",
    "the same procedure is applied on data from all energies and the final @xmath11 and @xmath12 as a function of collision energy is presented in figure  [ fig : meannclan ] and figure  [ fig : meanclanm ] , respectively . not surprisingly the average total number of clans per event is found to increase either with decreasing centrality , or with increasing energy , indicating that more clans are produced when the system becomes larger and/or when there is more energy available for particle production .",
    "the average charged particles per clan shows little dependence on energy for peripheral collisions , which is expected if peripheral collisions are regarded as simple superpositions of independent binary collisions , thus they should show the same clustering property . from peripheral to central collisions ,",
    "@xmath12 exhibits an energy dependence , with a minimum at 27 gev and an enhancement at 62 gev .",
    "such dependence is seen in non - peripheral collisions and is strongest in most central collisions .",
    "if there is a phase transition , one would expect a disturbance in particle production which reveals itself through the change of clustering characteristics .",
    "the feature observed is a motivation for further studies in this direction .",
    "it is worth to point out that the dependence becomes less significant when the dca cut is released to 2 cm or 3 cm , or when protons , contaminated by transported ones , are included .",
    "both observations ( not shown ) indicate that the feature is prominent in primarily produced particles , for which the clan concept applies .",
    "the apparent enhancement at 62 gev may be affected by worse beam condition at that particular energy and needs a further investigation .    due to the change in operation condition , for example",
    ", temperature and air pressure of tpc , the efficiency is not a constant .",
    "nevertheless , one can correct for efficiency and recover the efficiency - corrected @xmath11 and @xmath12 by applying the following two identities  @xcite : & = & + p & = & , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are measured observables , and @xmath10 and @xmath15 are efficiency - corrected ones . here",
    "@xmath16 is the _ detecting efficiency _ in general meaning , which includes both the finite detector efficiency effect and the finite detector acceptance effect , @xmath16 = efficiency @xmath17 acceptance . with that , the efficiency corrected @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be calculated , |n & = & -k p = -k +    feature , without loosing generality , assuming a 30% efficiency and 5% variation in year - to - year operation , the resulted variation in @xmath12 is too small ( comparable to symbol size in figure  [ fig : meanclanm ] ) to explain the variation seen in data .",
    "in this paper , star s measurement of average total number of clans per event , @xmath11 , and average charged particles per clan , @xmath12 , are studied for auau collisions at = 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev , for a variety of centrality classes .",
    "@xmath11 is found to increase with decreasing centrality and/or increasing energy , and @xmath12 is found to decrease with decreasing centrality . within the same centrality class ,",
    "@xmath12 exhibits a reduction between 19.6 gev and 62 gev , with the minimum around 27 gev .",
    "the structure is not seen in peripheral collisions ( 50%-70% ) but is visible in middle central collisions and , becomes prominent in central collisions ( top 5% ) .",
    "the variation of mean number of particles per clan with energy can not be explained by variation in detecting efficiency .",
    "whether the observed structure is connected to a phase transition needs further investigations .",
