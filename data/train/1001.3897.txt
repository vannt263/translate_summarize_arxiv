    "for over 50 years , measurements of @xmath0 pair production by energetic ions incident on emulsion detectors have yielded events with opening angles at the @xmath4 vertex larger than those expected @xcite for external pair conversion ( epc ) by photons @xcite . on the basis of relatively small data sets ,",
    "el - nadi and badawy @xcite and de boer and van dantzig @xcite proposed in 1988 that such events might represent the decays of neutral bosons with masses considerably larger than generally expected for weinberg - wilczek axions .",
    "since then , additional studies of relativistic heavy - ion interactions with emulsion @xcite have been interpreted in terms of massive neutral boson production .",
    "while such observations have triggered interest @xcite and are mentioned in the review of particle physics section on axion searches @xcite , no comprehensive attempt has been made to assess whether these observations represent new phenomena worthy of further investigation or background effects resulting from well - characterized processes .    in this paper , we revisit results from six accelerator studies using emulsion detectors , all of which report observations of @xmath0 pairs that are interpreted as evidence for the existence of neutral bosons with masses between 1.5 and 30 mev/@xmath1 and lifetimes between @xmath5 and @xmath6 s @xcite .",
    "four of these studies @xcite were published after the 1988 proposal that such events might represent the decays of massive neutral bosons @xcite , and hence can be considered tests of this proposal .",
    "the assumptions made regarding background processes are not , however , consistent across these six studies , and the reported neutral boson masses are not identical ; indeed jain and singh @xcite report a continuous spectrum of novel neutral bosons with masses up to 85 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "we have therefore re - analysed these @xmath0 pair production data using a single set of assumptions regarding background processes that are consistent with the experimental data reported by each of these studies .",
    "we also re - analysed the classic cosmic - ray data of anand @xcite and hintermann @xcite as comparisons .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted data sets , taken together , raise the possibility of a spectrum of neutral bosons with energies between 3 and 20 mev/@xmath1 and lifetimes on the order of femtoseconds .",
    "this mass - lifetime window , and in particular the existence of a 9.8 mev/@xmath1 neutral boson decaying to @xmath0 pairs , is consistent with measurements of anomalous internal pair production ( ipc ) in decays of excited states of light nuclei that suggest the existence of both unnatural parity ( pseudoscalar and axial - vector ) @xcite and natural parity ( scalar and vector ) neutral bosons @xcite .",
    "the existence of neutral particles decaying to @xmath0 pairs in this mass - lifetime window was not investigated in early beam - dump measurements @xcite . due to the long beam dumps",
    ", these experiments using high - energy electron and proton beams from laboratories including slac , orsay and fnal could only rule out lighter , longer - lived axion candidates ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "results from a later experiment by bross et al @xcite , using a short beam dump with sensitivity to short - lived bosons with @xmath8 , partly overlap the present lifetime window but do not exclude it .",
    "if multiple neutral particles with similar rest masses exist , it is possible that their individual effects on the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments would cancel out , potentially explaining the lack of evidence for massive axion - like particles in the available magnetic - moment data .",
    "we conclude that the observations reviewed and re - evaluated here support the existence of fewer massive neutral particles than have been previously claimed @xcite . however , we interpret these data as providing sufficient suggestive evidence for novel massive neutral bosons with femtosecond lifetimes to encourage further experimental investigation .",
    "if confirmed , the existence of such massive neutral bosons would provide _ prima facie _ support for theoretical models that propose axion - like particles with masses in the mev to 10s of mev range @xcite , as are increasingly motivated by cosmological data @xcite .",
    "fig.1 shows a compilation of @xmath0 pair - production events from both cosmic - ray @xcite and accelerator @xcite data sets for which electron energy and opening angle data are available .",
    "the signature of a massive particle @xmath2 decaying to @xmath0 is an opening angle @xmath9 from the pair vertex larger than the borsellino @xcite angle @xmath10 , where @xmath11 = 0.511 mev/@xmath1 and @xmath12 is the total pair energy in mev , expected for epc .",
    "emulsion detectors are ideal for detecting such events , as they allow accurate measurements of both the opening angle and the kinetic energies of the outgoing @xmath0 pair .    as can be seen in fig.1 , a large fraction of the observed events fall below the borsellino line .",
    "all such events are consistent with @xmath0 decay of a massless particle , i.e. with epc by photons . in the highest - energy reaction considered here ,",
    "160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb on emulsion @xcite , 1,158 out of 1,220 recorded @xmath0 events ( 95% ) have opening angles below the borsellino line ( cf .",
    "1f of @xcite ) and hence are _ prima facie _ consistent with epc ; these points are not plotted in fig .",
    "1 as they would obscure the much smaller numbers of low - angle events recorded from lower - energy experiments .",
    "it has been understood since the pioneering observations of hintermann @xcite that the effective - photon approximation reflected by the borsellino line significantly overpredicts the average opening angle and hence transverse momentum of epc - derived @xmath0 pairs at the pair - production threshold .",
    "qed calculations of pair production cross - sections near threshold correctly reproduce both the observed transverse momenta and the near - threshold cross - section , confirming that the effective - photon approximation is accurate for apparent pair masses above the pair - production threshold @xcite .",
    "previous analyses of these data have considered photons from @xmath15 decay to be the primary source of the epc background evident in fig . 1 @xcite ; however , photons have a mean free path in emulsion of roughly 5 cm @xcite , so photons from @xmath16 decay would be expected to efficiently escape the reaction zone . indeed , jain and singh @xcite estimate that only 73 @xmath0 pairs from @xmath15 decay , distributed isotropically , would be observed within the area of emulsion that they analyzed following 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb bombardment , compared to 1,158 pairs with opening angles consistent with epc actually observed within the forward cone only .",
    "a similar discrepancy between expected epc from the @xmath15 channel and observed events below the borsellino line is evident in the analysis of the 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s reaction on emulsion @xcite .",
    "a reconsideration of background processes in these data sets is therefore necessary .",
    "the production of photons as bremsstrahlung radiation following coulomb excitation of beam particles via interactions with target nuclei at large impact parameters has largely been neglected in previous analyses of these data sets , but can be expected to generate significant epc backgrounds in these reactions . the effective energy transfer of such interactions decreases by roughly an order of magnitude for every order of magnitude increase in impact parameter @xcite ; the cross section for projectile excitations in the 100 kev to 10 mev range , below the threshold for projectile breakup",
    ", is therefore expected to be on the order of 10,000 @xmath18 the projectile breakup cross - section .",
    "heavy nuclei coulomb - excited below 10 mev can be expected to de - excite by @xmath19-emission , with average @xmath19 multiplicities on the order of 10 per coulomb excitation event .",
    "photons that are significantly aligned with the projectile momentum ( @xmath20 of the total ) will be lorentz boosted to energies up to the maximum effective photon energy of @xmath21 @xcite . for 200 a@xmath13gev",
    "@xmath17s on emulsion , baroni _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report an average of 2.4 projectile breakup events per meter of penetration ; hence one can expect about @xmath22 @xmath19 s due to bremsstrahlung from coulomb - excited projectiles per meter of target penetration for this reaction , with about @xmath23 @xmath19 s per meter in the forward cone . the nuclear - interaction mean free path for 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s in emulsion is about 100 mm @xcite , so one can expect on the order of 6,000 forward @xmath19 s per observed nuclear interaction .",
    "about half of these @xmath19 s will convert within the first 5 cm from the breakup event ; one would therefore expect about 3 epc events per 50 @xmath24 m downstream of an identified 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s - emulsion interaction . in the case of the 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath25pb data set",
    ", one would expect about 75 epc events per 50 @xmath24 m downstream of an identified interaction .",
    "the experimental signature of such @xmath19-interactions would be a nearly - uniform distribution of @xmath0 events closely collimated to the pre - interaction projectile trajectory , attenuating linearly with distance @xmath26 from the projectile interaction as photons escape the viewing area of the tracking microscope .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of @xmath0 events from 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s bombardment of emulsion as a function of distance @xmath26 from the observed projectile - emulsion reaction @xcite .",
    "figure 2 can be compared with the very similar distribution of events from 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb on emulsion , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) of @xcite . in both of these studies , events",
    "very near the observed reaction were rejected ; @xmath27 m for the 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s data @xcite and @xmath28 m for the 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb data @xcite .",
    "both @xmath26 distributions attenuate by roughly a factor of two per 1,000 @xmath24 m over the entire range scanned , consistent with the 120 @xmath24 m @xcite and 100 @xmath24 m @xcite fields of view of the scanning microscopes used and a lorenz boost of roughly 1,000 @xmath18 for forward - cone bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "these observed distributions support the interpretation of all events at @xmath29 m from the reaction center in both data sets , most of which are below the borsellino line , as due to bremsstrahlung by coulomb - excited projectiles .",
    "photons produced by bremsstrahlung from ag and br nuclei in the emulsion target will not in general be lorenz boosted , and hence will contribute negligibly to the number of epc events observed in the vicinity of the beam track .",
    "reaction products including breakup fragments of the projectile ( mainly @xmath30 particles @xcite ) can be expected to be coulomb - excited as they exit the emulsion ; such fragments will produce bremsstrahlung photons by the mechanism discussed above in proportion to their @xmath31 .",
    "approximately one photon per 2,500 @xmath24 m of beam - fragment track from an identified projectile - target reaction is expected from this secondary mechanism in the case of 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s on emulsion .",
    "however , heavy fragments typically exit the reaction zone at relatively high angles from the beam ( cf . figs 3 - 5 to 3 - 14 of @xcite and fig",
    ". 3 of @xcite ) , so bremsstrahlung photons from beam - fragment excitation are not expected to contribute significantly to epc events observed in the immediate vicinity the primary beam track .",
    "photons from @xmath15 may contribute to epc near the observed reaction center ; however , the number of events observed at small @xmath26 compared to the large-@xmath26 tail in the 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s and 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb reactions does not appear to scale with the 2 @xmath18 greater @xmath16 production expected @xcite in the latter reaction .",
    "hence bremsstrahlung from coulomb - excited projectiles is expected to be the primary generator of epc events in the data sets considered here .",
    "the cross section for epc by photons is strongly peaked at the production threshold value of @xmath32 , and decreases above threshold as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which for @xmath35 can be approximated as @xmath36 @xcite . for the 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s data , @xmath37 gev ( fig.5 of @xcite ) ,",
    "while for the 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb data , @xmath38 gev ( fig.1f of @xcite ) ; hence the above - threshold epc background spectrum for these data sets can be expected to be identical up to normalization .",
    "the 3.5 a@xmath13gev @xmath39he , @xmath40c and @xmath41ne reactions generate photons with @xmath42 mev @xcite ; the @xmath36 approximation is expected to somewhat over - predict the epc background in this case , but is employed for consistency .",

    "@xmath17s data from table 1 of @xcite , for the 160 a@xmath13gev @xmath14pb data from fig.1f of @xcite computed as described @xcite , and for the 3.5 a@xmath13gev @xmath39he , @xmath40c and @xmath41ne data from fig .",
    "3 - 4 and table 3 - 1 of @xcite .",
    "the lower cutoff of @xmath43 mev/@xmath1 is that chosen by el - nadi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to reject threshold @xmath0 production events , and is used to avoid under - prediction of epc by the effective - photon approximation . a bin size of 1 mev/@xmath44 was employed consistently for all data ; this bin size corresponds to the experimental mass resolution for pair masses between 3 and 7 mev/@xmath44 reported by the studies for which tabulated data are available @xcite .",
    "all of the data sets analyzed here represent selections from larger collections of observed by not analyzed events , hence the normalization of the epc predictions , and in particular the ratio of threshold to above - threshold @xmath0 production , can not be calculated reliably from the available data .",
    "normalizations for the epc predictions have therefore been chosen for each reaction to fit the data between 1.3 and 3.3 mev/@xmath1 , i.e. the first two bins of the histograms shown in figs 3 and 4 .",
    "this choice of normalization is consistent with the well - established accuracy of the effective photon approximation above the pair - production threshold .",
    "the alternative of normalizing all data sets at higher mass values would produce order - of - magnitude overpredictions of the low - mass data for which no plausible explanation could be offered .",
    "the normalization of the epc prediction for the 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s data with @xmath45 m shown in fig .",
    "3 is consistent with that used by kamel @xcite in analysing direct pair production ( @xmath46 m ) from 200 a@xmath13gev @xmath17s on emulsion .",
    "the rejection of non - epc events as background using this stringent normalization can not be ruled out , especially for the lower - energy data sets .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , all of the events with invariant mass below 8 mev/@xmath1 reported in @xcite can be interpreted as due to epc by bremsstrahlung photons , as can events below 6 mev/@xmath1 reported by @xcite and events below 4 mev/@xmath1 reported by @xcite . the statistical significance @xmath47 , where @xmath48 represents counts in the `` signal '' and @xmath49 counts in the `` background '' @xcite varies from @xmath50 for the 9.8 mev/@xmath1 event reported in @xcite to @xmath51 for the 8.8 mev/@xmath1 event reported in @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows background due to epc for the cosmic - ray data sets of hintermann @xcite and anand @xcite and the 60 a@xmath13gev @xmath52o data set of badawy @xcite , calculated and normalized using the same procedures as used in fig .",

    "the calculated epc backgrounds shown in figs 3 and 4 , and in fig .",
    "2f of @xcite , are therefore taken to represent the backgrounds due to known pair - production processes in these data sets .",
    "background subtraction was carried out for all spectra with a criterion of @xmath57 ; the results of this subtraction are shown in fig .",
    "5 . these background - subtracted spectra are taken to be free of background events from characterized sources .",
    "the events shown in the background - subtracted spectra of fig . 5 , together with one event at 9.8 mev/@xmath1 well - separated from background from @xcite , events at 5.5 , 7.0 and 16.5 mev/@xmath1 well - separated from background from @xcite , and an event at 9.5 mev/@xmath1 well - separated from background from @xcite were added within 1-mev/@xmath1 bins ; the sum spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "6 . while none of the studies from which these data are taken claimed to employ blind analysis methods @xcite and unknown effects due to measurement conditions or to inconsistent assumptions or analysis methods can not be ruled out , the addition of these data sets to generate a single sum spectrum is justified if the published data are taken at face value .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of this sum spectrum is that it contains mass peaks with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately 2 mev/@xmath1 overlaid on a uniform background of approximately one event per bin .",
    "the source of such a uniform background is unknown ; however , there is no experimental motivation for assuming a nonuniform background , and in particular none for assuming a nonmonotonic background . assuming a fwhm of 2 mev/@xmath1 and imposing a criterion of @xmath57 against a uniform 1-event background , peaks can be identified at 3.8 mev/@xmath1 ( 3@xmath3 ) , 5.8 mev/@xmath1 ( 2.5@xmath3 ) , 7.8 mev/@xmath1 ( 4.2@xmath3 ) , 9.8 mev/@xmath1 ( 8.2@xmath3 ) , 15.8 mev/@xmath1 ( 3@xmath3 ) and 18.8 mev/@xmath1 ( 2@xmath3 ) .",

    "emission of a neutral boson consistent with x(9.8 ) has also been advanced as an explanation of anomalous ipc angular distributions in the decays of excited states of @xmath39he , @xmath73be , and @xmath40c @xcite , and well as the forbidden 10.96 mev @xmath74 _ m0 _ decay in @xmath52o @xcite .",

    "consideration of the predicted effects of such @xmath2-bosons on the anomalous magnetic moments of both the electron and muon rules out the possibility of a single massive @xmath2-boson , but leaves open the possibility that @xmath2-boson excitations include both natural and unnatural parity states for each spin .    we conclude that the experimental observations reviewed here offer evidence for the existence of new neutral bosons with masses between 3 and 20 mev/@xmath1 and femtosecond lifetimes that encourages dedicated further searches for such particles .",
    "the inferred behaviour of the direct production cross - section indicates that such searches are best carried out below or in the vicinity of the pion production threshold .",
