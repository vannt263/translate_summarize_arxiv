    "the term electrowetting on dielectric refers to the local modification of the surface tension between two immiscible fluids via electric actuation .",
    "this allows for change of shape and wetting behavior of a the two - fluid system and , thus , for its manipulation and control .",
    "the existence of such a phenomenon was originally discovered by lippmann @xcite , more than a century ago ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , only recently has electrowetting found a wide spectrum of applications , specially in the realm of micro - fluidics @xcite .",
    "one can mention , for example , reprogrammable lab - on - chip systems @xcite , auto - focus cell phone lenses @xcite , colored oil pixels and video speed smart paper @xcite . in @xcite , the reverse electrowetting process has been proposed as an approach to energy harvesting .    from the examples presented above , it becomes clear that it is very important for applications to have a better understanding of this phenomenon and it is necessary to obtain reliable computational tools for the simulation and control of these effects .",
    "the computational models must be complete enough , so that they can reproduce the most important physical effects , yet sufficiently simple that it is possible to extract from them meaningful information in a reasonable amount of computing time .",
    "several works have been concerned with the modeling of electrowetting .",
    "the approaches include experimental relations and scaling laws @xcite , empirical models @xcite , studies concerning the dependence of the contact angle ( @xcite ) or the shape of the droplet ( @xcite ) on the applied voltage , lattice boltzmann methods @xcite and others .",
    "of relevance to our present discussion are the works @xcite and @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "@xcite are the first papers where the contact line pinning was included in an electrowetting model . on the other hand",
    "the models of @xcite are the only ones that are intrinsically three dimensional and do not assume any special geometric configuration .",
    "they have the limitation , however , that they assume the density of the two fluids to be constant and they apply a no - slip boundary condition to the fluid - solid interface , thus limiting the movement of the droplet .",
    "the purpose of this work is to propose and analyze an electrowetting model that is intrinsically three - dimensional ; it takes into account that all material parameters are different in each one of the fluids ; and it is derived ( as long as this is possible ) from physical principles . to do so",
    ", we extend the diffuse interface model of @xcite .",
    "the main additions are the fact that we allow the fluids to have different densities  thus leading to a variable density cahn hilliard navier stokes system  and that we treat the contact line movement in a thermodynamically consistent way , namely using the so - called generalized navier boundary condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we propose a ( phenomenological ) approach to contact line pinning and study stability and convergence of discretization techniques . in this respect ,",
    "our work also differs from @xcite , since our approach deals with a practical fully discrete scheme , for which we derive a priori estimates and convergence results .    through private communication",
    "we have become aware of the following recent contributions : discretization schemes for the model proposed in @xcite are studied in @xcite ; the models of @xcite have been extended , using the techniques of @xcite , in @xcite where discretization issues are also discussed .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sub : notation ] we introduce the notation and some preliminary assumptions necessary for our discussion . section  [ sec : model ] describes the model that we shall be concerned with and its physical derivation .",
    "a formal energy estimate and a formal weak formulation of our problem is shown in section  [ sec : energy ] .",
    "the energy estimate shown in this section serves as a basis for the precise definition of our notion of solution and the proof of its existence .",
    "the details of this are accounted for in section  [ sec : discrete ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": numexp ] we discuss discretization techniques for our problem and present some numerical experiments aimed at showing the capabilities of our model : droplet splitting and coalescence as well as contact line movement .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : semidiscrete ] , we briefly discuss convergence of the discrete solutions to solutions of a semi - discrete problem .",

    "we use the symbol @xmath3 to denote the domain occupied by the fluid and @xmath1 for the fluid and dielectric plates , thus , @xmath4 . in this manner , we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath1 are convex , bounded connected domains in @xmath5 , for @xmath6 or @xmath7 , with @xmath8 boundaries . the boundary of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 stands for the outer unit normal to @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 $ ] with @xmath12 the time interval of interest . for any vector valued function @xmath13 that is smooth enough",
    "so as to have a trace on @xmath0 , we define the tangential component of @xmath14 as @xmath15 and , for any scalar function @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "we will use standard notation for spaces of lebesgue integrable functions @xmath18 and sobolev spaces @xmath19 , @xcite .",

    "we define the following spaces : @xmath26 normed by @xmath27 and @xmath28 which we endow with the norm @xmath29 clearly , for these norms , they are hilbert spaces .    to take into account the fact that our problem will be time dependent we introduce the following notation .",

    "we define the time - increment operator @xmath44 by @xmath45 and the time average operator @xmath46 by @xmath47 on sequences @xmath48 we define the norms @xmath49 which are , respectively , discrete analogues of the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 norms .",
    "when dealing with energy estimates of time discrete problems , we will make , without explicit mention , repeated use of the following elementary identity @xmath53",
    "in this section we briefly describe the derivation of our model . the procedure used to obtain it is quite similar to the arguments used in @xcite and it fits into the general ideological framework of so - called phase - field models . in phase - field methods ,",
    "sharp interfaces are replaced by thin transitional layers where the interfacial forces are now smoothly distributed and , thus , there is no need to explicitly track interfaces .      to develop a phase - field model , we begin by introducing a so - called phase field variable @xmath54 and an interface thickness @xmath55 .",
    "the phase field variable acts as a marker that will be almost constant ( in our case @xmath56 ) in the bulk regions , and will smoothly transition between these values in an interfacial region of thickness @xmath55 .",
    "having introduced the phase field , all the material properties that depend on the phase are slave variables and defined as @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are the values on each one of the phases .",
    "relation is not the only possible definition of the phase dependent quantities .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposes to use a linear average between the bulk values .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the derivative of a phase - dependent field with respect to the phase ( expressions that contain such quantities appear repeatedly ) is constant , which greatly simplifies the calculations .",
    "however , this definition can not be guaranteed to stay in the physical range of values which might lead to , say , a vanishing density or viscosity . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite proposes to use a harmonic average which guarantees that positive quantities stay bounded away from zero . in this work",
    ", we will assume that , with the exception of the permittivity @xmath59 , is the way the slave variables are defined , which has the advantage that guarantees that the field stays within the physical bounds .",
    "any other definition with this property is equally suitable for our purposes .",
    "we model the droplet and surrounding medium as an incompressible newtonian viscous two - phase fluid , so that its behavior is governed by the variable density incompressible navier stokes equations .",
    "the equation of conservation of momentum can be written in several forms .",
    "we chose the one proposed by guermond and quartapelle ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) because its nonlinear term possesses a skew symmetry property similar to the constant density navier stokes equations ,    [ eq : nse ] @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the density of the fluid and depends on the phase field ; @xmath63 is the velocity of the fluid ; @xmath64 is the pressure ; @xmath65 is the viscosity of the fluid and depends on @xmath54 ; @xmath66 is the symmetric part of the gradient and @xmath67 are the external forces acting on the fluid .",
    "the phase field can be thought of as a scalar that is convected by the flow .",
    "hence its motion is described by @xmath68 for some flux field @xmath69 which will be found later .    to model the interaction between the applied voltage and the fluid",
    "we introduce the charge density @xmath70 .",
    "another possibility , not explored here , is to introduce ion concentrations , thus leading to a nernst planck poisson - like system , see @xcite .",
    "the electric displacement field @xmath71 is defined in @xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of these two quantities is governed by maxwell s equations , @xmath72 for some flux @xmath73 .",
    "notice that we assume that the magnitude of the velocity of the fluid is negligible in comparison with the speed of light , and that the frequency of voltage actuation is sufficiently small , so that magnetic effects can be ignored .",
    "taking the time derivative of the first equation and substituting in the second we obtain @xmath74    to close the system , we must prescribe boundary conditions , determine the force @xmath67 exerted on the fluid , and find constitutive relations for the fluxes @xmath69 and @xmath73 .",
    "we are assuming the solid walls are impermeable , therefore if @xmath10 is the normal to @xmath0 , @xmath75 on @xmath0 and @xmath76 for any flux @xmath77 . to find the rest of the boundary conditions , @xmath67 and relations for the fluxes , we denote the surface tension between the two phases by @xmath78 and define the ginzburg - landau double well potential by @xmath79    the original definition , given by cahn and hilliard , of the potential is logarithmic .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite . this way , the potential becomes infinite if the phase field variable is out of the range @xmath80 $ ] , thus guaranteeing that the phase field variable @xmath54 stays within that range .",
    "this is difficult to treat both in the analysis and numerics and hence practitioners have used the ginzburg - landau potential @xmath81 , for some @xmath82 .",
    "we go one step further and restrict the growth of the potential to quadratic away from the range of interest . with this restriction caffarelli and mller , @xcite , have shown uniform @xmath83-bounds on the solutions of the cahn hilliard equations ( which as we will see below the phase field must satisfy ) .",
    "this has also proved useful in the numerical discretization of the cahn hilliard and cahn hilliard navier stokes equations , see @xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce the interface energy density function , which describes the energy due to the fluid - solid interaction .",
    "let @xmath84 be the contact angle that , at equilibrium , the interface between the two fluids makes with respect to the solid walls ( see @xcite ) and define @xmath85 then , up to a constant , the interfacial energy density equals @xmath86 .",
    "let us write the free energy of the system @xmath87 where @xmath59 is the electric permittivity of the medium and @xmath88 is a regularization parameter .",
    "computing the variation of the energy @xmath89 with respect to @xmath54 , while keeping all the other arguments fixed , we obtain that @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the so - called chemical potential which , in this situation , is given by @xmath92 the quantity @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 and can be regarded as a `` chemical potential '' on the boundary .    from the definition of the chemical potential @xmath91",
    "we see that the product @xmath95 includes the usual terms that define the surface tension , @xmath96 additionally , it has the term @xmath97 which , in some sense , can be thought of as coming from the maxwell stress tensor .    with this notation , let us take the time derivative of the free energy : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the electric field , defined as @xmath100 .",
    "let us rewrite each one of the terms in this expression .",
    "using and the impermeability conditions , @xmath101 using @xmath102 for the boundary term , we introduce the material derivative at the boundary @xmath103 and rewrite @xmath104 notice that @xmath105 , so that using , and integrating by parts , we obtain @xmath106 finally , using and the impermeability condition @xmath107 , @xmath108    with the help of these calculations , we find that the time - derivative of the free energy can be rewritten as @xmath109    from , we can identify the power of the system , the time derivative of the work @xmath110 of internal forces , upon collecting all terms having a scalar product with the velocity @xmath63 , @xmath111 we assume that the system is closed , there are no external forces .",
    "this implies that @xmath112 and we obtain an expression for the forces @xmath67 acting on the fluid , @xmath113    using the first law of thermodynamics @xmath114 where the absolute temperature is denoted by @xmath115 and the entropy by @xmath116 , we can conclude that @xmath117    to find an expression for the fluxes we introduce , in the spirit of onsager @xcite , a dissipation function @xmath118 .",
    "since this must be a positive definite function on the fluxes , the simplest possible expression for a dissipation function is quadratic and diagonal in the fluxes , @xmath119 where all the proportionality constants , in principle , can depend on the phase @xmath54 . here",
    ", @xmath120 is known as the mobility , @xmath121 the conductivity and @xmath122 the slip coefficient . using onsager s relation @xmath123 and , we find that @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "definitions can also be obtained by simply saying that the constitutive relations of the fluxes depend linearly on the gradients , which is implicitly postulated in the form of the dissipation function @xmath118 .    since , in practical settings , there is an externally applied voltage ( which is going to act as the control mechanism ) we introduce a potential @xmath126 and then the electric field is given by @xmath127 with @xmath128 on @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the voltage applied .",
    "to summarize , we obtain the following system of equations for the phase variable @xmath54 and the chemical potential @xmath91 , @xmath131 and the velocity @xmath63 and pressure @xmath64 , @xmath132 where we have set @xmath133 in addition , we have the equation for the electric charges @xmath70 , @xmath134 , & \\text{in } \\omega , \\\\",

    "in , the boundary condition for the tangential velocity is known as the generalized navier boundary condition ( gnbc ) , and it is aimed at resolving the so - called contact line paradox of the movement of a two phase fluid on a solid wall . the reader is referred to , for instance , @xcite for a discussion of its derivation . although there has been a lot of discussion and controversy around the validity of this boundary condition , see for instance @xcite , we shall take the gnbc as a given and will not discuss its applicability and/or consequences here .",

    "a farad ( f ) is @xmath140 .",
    "for drinking water , @xmath121 is @xmath141 to @xmath142 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : physical_parameters ]    here we present appropriate scalings so that we may write equations  in non - dimensional form .",
    "table  [ tbl : physical_parameters ] shows some typical values for the material parameters appearing in the model .",
    "consider the following scalings : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the capillary number , @xmath145 is the reynolds number , @xmath146 is the weber number , @xmath147 is the electro - wetting bond number , @xmath148 is the ratio of fluid forces to electrical forces , @xmath149 is the ratio of surface tension to `` phase field forces , '' @xmath150 is a ( non - dimensional ) mobility coefficient , @xmath151 is a conductivity coefficient , and @xmath152 is an electric charge coefficient .",
    "let us now make the change of variables . to simplify notation",
    ", we drop the tildes , and consider all variables and differential operators as non - dimensional .",
    "the fluid equations read : @xmath153 the phase - field equations change to ( again dropping the tilde ) @xmath154 performing the change of variables on the charge transport equation gives @xmath155",
    "lastly , for the electrostatic equation we obtain @xmath156 where @xmath157 has been normalized by @xmath158 .    to alleviate the notation , for the rest of our discussion we will set all the nondimensional groups ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) to one .",
    "if needed , the dependence of the constants on all these parameters can be traced by following our arguments . moreover",
    ", we must note that if a simplification of this model is desired , then these scalings must serve as a guide to decide which effects are dominant .      as we can see from and",
    ", our model incorporates tangential derivatives of the phase variable @xmath54 at the boundary @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , in the analysis , we are not capable of dealing with these terms . therefore , we propose some simplifications .    the first possible simplification is simply to ignore the terms that contain this tangential derivative ; see @xcite .",
    "however , it is our feeling that the presence of them is important , specially in dealing with the contact angle in the gnbc .    a second possibility would be to add an _ ad hoc _ term of the form @xmath159 on the boundary condition for the phase variable , where by @xmath160 we denote the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath0 . a similar approach has been followed , in a somewhat different context , for instance , by prss @xcite and cherfils @xcite . however , this condition might lead to lack of conservation of @xmath54 , which is an important feature of phase field models based on the cahn hilliard equation .",
    "finally , the approach that we propose is to recall that , in principle , the phase field variable must be constant in the bulk of each one of the phases and so @xmath161 there .",
    "moreover , in the sharp interface limit this tangential derivative must be a dirac measure supported on the interface .",
    "therefore we define a function @xmath162 and replace all the instances of @xmath163 by @xmath164 .",
    "simply put , the contact line pinning ( hysteresis ) is a frictional effect that occurs at the three - phase contact line , and is rather controversial .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an explanation about its origins and possible dependences .",
    "let us here only mention that , macroscopically , the pinning force has a threshold value and , thus , it should depend on the stress at the contact line .",
    "it is important to take into account contact line pinning since , as observed in @xcite , it is crucial for capturing the true time scales of the problem .",
    "we propose a phenomenological approach to deal with this effect . from the gnbc ,",
    "@xmath165 we can see that , to recover no - slip conditions , one must set the slip coefficient @xmath122 sufficiently large . on the contrary , when @xmath122 is small , one obtains an approximation of full slip conditions .",
    "a simple dimensional argument then shows that @xmath166 , where @xmath167 has the dimensions of inverse length .",
    "therefore , we propose the slip coefficient to have the following form @xmath168 where @xmath169 where @xmath55 is the non - dimensional transition length . for the purposes of analysis , we face the same difficulties in this expression as in  [ sub : tangentialderiv ] .",
    "ergo , we will use this to model pinning in the numerical examples , but leave it out of the analysis .",
    "in this section we obtain a weak formulation for problem  and show a formal energy estimate , which serves as an a priori estimate and the basic relation on which our existence theory is based .      to obtain a weak formulation of the problem , we begin by multiplying the first equation of by @xmath170 , the second by @xmath171 and integrating in @xmath3 . after integration by parts , taking into account the boundary conditions , we arrive at    [ eq : phaseweak ] @xmath172 @xmath173    multiply the first equation of by @xmath14 such that @xmath174 , the second by @xmath175 and integrate in @xmath3 .",
