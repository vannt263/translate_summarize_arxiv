    "the problem of the @xmath0 polarization in hadron - hadron reactions at high energies remains still vital even in spite of the thirty years have passed since it was discovered @xcite .",
    "being produced in @xmath2 collisions at 300 gev proton beam energy , the @xmath0 hyperons were found to be highly polarized while neither the beam nor the beryllium target possessed any initial polarization .",
    "its direction was , in accordance with the spatial parity conservation , opposite to the unit vector @xmath3 $ ] , ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the beam and hyperon momenta , respectively ) , which is normal to the production plane or , in other words , transverse to the direction of this particle s motion .",
    "this phenomenon turned out to be quite surprising for the widely spread belief that spin flip processes would not take any significant place at such high energies as the helicity is conserved in the limit of massless quarks .",
    "certainly , it has induced much attention to be focused as well on studies of the polarization experimentally , using a variety of beam hadrons and targets at different kinematic regimes , as on its theoretical explanations .",
    "thus , further experiments on @xmath2 collisions in wide range of the beam energies were carried out @xcite . the same was done for @xmath6 at @xmath7 12 gev - 176 gev @xcite , it was also examined in @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . to obtain more systematic knowledge on this issue , polarizations of other hyperons",
    "were studied as well , e.g. @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite . a different angle of sight , which could assist in the solution of the problem , may be provided by processes , where hyperons themselves acted as projectiles , for example @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite .    among the most remarkable features of the @xmath0 polarization one can highlight the extremely weak dependence on the incident particle energy or , if the process is considered in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame , on the total c.m .",
    "energy @xmath15 .",
    "the polarization grows by magnitude roughly linearly with the transverse momentum of the hyperon @xmath16 .",
    "it also depends , though not so strongly as on @xmath16 , on @xmath17 , where @xmath18 - longitudinal momentum of the outgoing @xmath0 .",
    "another notable property is the sign of the polarization , being negative in @xmath2 collisions for @xmath0 , @xmath19 it appears to be positive for @xmath20 .",
    "the positive sign has been observed in @xmath6 as well .",
    "although there have been the large amount of experimental information , no model is elaborated still to account convincingly for the complete set of the available measurements from a unified point of view .",
    "the existing phenomenological approaches are , in more or less extent , fragmentary in reproducing the data ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "especially useful instrument for spin effect investigations in strong interactions seems to be the @xmath0 due to its wave function structure peculiarities .",
    "the approximation of the su(6 ) symmetry requires the spin - flavor part of the wave function to be combined of the @xmath21 diquark in a singlet spin state and the strange quark of spin 1/2 , or rather formally @xmath22 , where the subscriptions refer to the spin states .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 total spin is entirely determined by its valence @xmath23 quark .",
    "thus , one may attribute the @xmath0 polarization to the strange quark only @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the su(6 ) symmetric picture has been also applied to calculations of the longitudinal @xmath0 polarization in @xmath24 annihilation at the @xmath25 pole @xcite and then justified experimentally @xcite .    in light of the discussion above , to wonder whether the polarization would be manifested in reactions induced by pointlike particles , such as leptons or photons ,",
    "becomes an interesting question .",
    "indeed , experiments on high energy @xmath26 scattering had been performed , for instance , at cern @xcite and slac @xcite ( @xmath27=20 gev - 70 gev ) , however , their statistical accuracy is insufficient for a decisive conclusion on the magnitude or on the sign of the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "rather relevant data for this purpose could be those on the 27.6 gev positron beam scattering from nucleon target recently obtained by hermes .",
    "the collaboration has measured nonzero positive transverse @xmath0 polarization , herewith most of the intermediate photons were very near the mass shell , i.e. @xmath28 gev@xmath29 , where @xmath30-are the 4-momenta of the initial and scattered electrons , respectively ( quasi - real photoproduction ) @xcite .",
    "we tackle here the transverse @xmath0 polarization in inclusive photoproduction at @xmath1 in the framework of the quark recombination model ( qrm ) .",
    "having been firstly proposed to account for meson production probabilities in @xmath31 collisions @xcite , the model was shown to be successful in describing the polarizations of different hyperons in a variety of high energy hadron - hadron reactions as well @xcite .",
    "we discuss the quark recombination mechanism below .",
    "let us , at first , briefly recall the essential ingredients of the qrm concerning the hyperon polarization .",
    "one can find very detailed description of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the sequel",
    "we will also abbreviate the collision @xmath32 ( e.g. @xmath33 ) as @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the quantity proportional to the reaction probability of the transition @xmath34 in the projectile infinite momentum frame ( imf ) is defined as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the spin projections of the hadrons @xmath39 and @xmath40 on the @xmath41 axis , which is defined by the vector [ @xmath42 , here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the momentum vectors of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; the @xmath45 axis is chosen to be parallel to @xmath43 ; @xmath46 are the momentum fractions carried by the partons with respect to the three independent directions @xmath47 ; @xmath48 are the parton distribution functions , the index @xmath49 denotes all the partons ( @xmath49=1,2,3,4 ) ; the summations are performed over the parton spins @xmath50 and their @xmath41 components @xmath51 ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the delta - functions providing energy - momentum conservation ; @xmath54 is the squared amplitude of a parton - parton scattering subprocess ; the sign @xmath55 denotes the convolution in bjorken @xmath56-space ( see eq .",
    "[ aeq : qrm4 ] in the appendix ) .    then , the polarization is standardly given by    @xmath57    how the polarization will behave depends crucially on particular forms of the squared amplitudes @xmath58 , i.e. on the specification of the underlying dynamic .",
    "yamamoto , kubo and toki have calculated them in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming a simple scalar type interaction for the relativistic parton - parton scattering processes and noted that non trivial spin dependent part appeared due to the interference term between the lowest and higher order amplitudes , similarly as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the final hadron of spin 1/2 may be resulted in recombinations of a quark with a suitable diquark of spin 0 or of spin 1 .",
    "typical representatives of such reactions , when considering the @xmath1 region , are the @xmath59 ( @xmath60+@xmath23 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62+@xmath63 ) transitions . accordingly , there are two free parameters in the model , @xmath64 - for scattering between the partons of spin 1/2 and spin 0 , @xmath65 - for scattering between the partons of spin 1/2 and spin 1 . having been fixed to fit the data for the transitions @xmath59 and @xmath61 , the parameters were used to reproduce reasonably the polarizations in other reactions of these kinds as well , e.g. in @xmath35 ( @xmath23+@xmath60 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath67+@xmath63 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath69+@xmath23 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath23+@xmath69 ) .",
    "another thing worthwhile to note is that the qrm automatically contains the rule proposed by degrand and miettinen @xcite , and reproduces not only the magnitudes , but also the signs of the polarizations .",
    "we turn now to the @xmath0 photoproduction at @xmath1 .",
    "the qrm can be straightforwardly extended to this process provided one regards the photon as a hadron in the sense of its well known quark degrees of freedom @xcite .",

    "unlike a hadron - hadron reaction ( say @xmath59 ) , which is contributed , as a rule , by a single dominant subprocess ( @xmath60+@xmath23 ) , the situation for the @xmath78 transition can be fairly expected to be rather rich .",

    "the data are collected not as the traditional @xmath121 dependence but as the dependence on @xmath129 , additionally integrated over @xmath16 ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the energy and longitudinal momentum of the beam particle ) . unlike @xmath121 ,",
    "the variable @xmath123 is , thus , just an approximate measure of whether the hyperons were produced in the current or target fragmentation regions .",
    "hence there is some ambiguity in the correlation between @xmath121 and @xmath123 , which causes an arbitrariness in the comparison of the hermes data with results expressed in terms of @xmath121 .",
    "the experimental @xmath16 dependence is also collected integrally over @xmath123 for two regions , @xmath132 and @xmath122 .",
    "additionally , the intermediate quasi - real photons of hermes were not , certainly , monoenergetic , though this problem could be omitted by exploiting the fact that the polarization is incident particle energy independent .    to make the comparison with the experiment more correct , we have averaged the calculated @xmath121 dependence of the polarization over the @xmath16 distribution of @xmath0 hyperons produced at hermes @xcite .",

    "following the recipes given in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the transverse @xmath0 polarization in inclusive photoproduction at @xmath1 can be fairly accommodated by the quark recombination model , which comes , thus , outside of the reactions induced by hadrons .",
    "all the free parameters we used in the calculations have been already fixed to reproduce the polarization in other hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "we have calculated as well the @xmath16 dependence of the polarization at @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the range 0.1 gev @xmath116 1.0 gev as the dependence on @xmath121 at three fixed values of @xmath16 , @xmath125 gev , @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 gev in the range 0.1 @xmath133 0.5 .",
    "we have compared the results with the hermes data and discussed in what extent it could be suitable for this purpose .",

    "additionally , we used only the events of @xmath122 to be , more or less , ensured that we dealt with the region of @xmath1 .",
    "so , we have found a sufficient agreement with the data both in magnitude and in the sign of the polarization .",
    "however , this consistency can be regarded only as qualitative because of , at least , a few reasons .",

    "the intermediate photons emitted by the hermes positron beam were not , indeed , monoenergetic .",
    "no information on the momentum transfer squared was derivable at the experiment while the structure functions used here are @xmath134 dependent .",
    "there are also another problems .",
    "since the spin dependent distributions of the partons were not available , we have naively assumed the structure functions to have the same form as well for the scalar as for vector diquarks .",
    "we have also supposed that the subprocesses @xmath23+@xmath60 , @xmath62+@xmath83 and @xmath67+@xmath82 contributed in the polarization with the same , positive , sign .",
    "these cases are structurally similar to the @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 transitions , respectively .",
    "certainly , the positive sign has been very reliably determined for @xmath135 , while , in fact , for the rest two cases the related situation is controversial due to the error bars of the data are still large ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this light",
    ", it would be interesting to compare our results with those from ref .",
    "@xcite , where similar calculations have been carried out .",
    "we did not take here contributions from the heavier resonances into account , which are presumably significant for the @xmath0 polarization @xcite .",
    "it can be done as a further improvement of the calculations , but , for this purpose , one needs to know , at least , the evolution of the variables @xmath121 and @xmath16 in the transition processes from the resonances to the final @xmath0 .",
    "it seems to be attractive to find the explicit expressions of the qrm amplitudes specifying the potential by the color field @xcite , which might lead , in some sense , to a unification of the present approach with other quark scattering models @xcite .",
    "we realized the condition when all the hyperons would be produced in the @xmath1 region by formal introducing the step function @xmath145 , which simply means that each quark coming from the photon will be faster than the corresponding picked up diquark .            to concentrate the attention on the integration over the momentum fractions @xmath148",
    ", we introduced the denotation ( [ denot ] ) .",
    "for the same reason , the dependences on the rest parameters and indices are omitted .",
    "the integration limit @xmath160 arose due to the step - function in eq .",
    "( [ denot ] ) , @xmath161 is introduced because of the difficulties associated with the irregular behavior of the integrand at the borders of the integration regions over @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in the actual computations ,",
