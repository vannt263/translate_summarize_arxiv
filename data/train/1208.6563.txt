    "in the semi - classical approach of gravity , we quantize fields in a classical metric background . although the semi - classical approach can not be the fundamental theory , it could give a useful guideline on how to approach to the problems of quantum gravity .",
    "one of the examples is hawking radiation in black hole physics @xcite . to study the nature of hawking radiation ,",
    "there are two useful approaches .",
    "one way is to treat quantum fluctuations of a field on the classical curved background @xcite .",
    "the other way is to use the euclidean path integral and obtain some thermodynamic quantities by the wick rotation @xcite .    in the same spirit",
    ", we can tackle cosmological problems with two different approaches .",
    "as an application of the former ( quantum field theory in a curved background ) , we can illustrate _",
    "stochastic inflation _",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite . here",
    ", we can divide the fourier modes into those shorter than the hubble radius and longer than the hubble radius .",
    "as long as the potential is broad and the field value is small , we can approximate that the longer wavelengths behave like a locally homogeneous and classical field while the shorter wavelengths act as a gaussian random noise to the longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the locally homogeneous scalar field will behave like a brownian particle .",
    "this randomly walking field can be described by the _ langevin equation_. in the entire ( inhomogeneous ) universe , there are many hubble patches that behave like this , and one may define the probability distribution of the fields for each of the hubble patches .",
    "the master equation of this probability distribution is the _ fokker - planck equation_.    as an application of the latter ( euclidean quantum gravity ) , it is useful to study the path integral .",
    "the ground state solution of the schrodinger equation with gravity , so - called the _ wheeler - dewitt equation _",
    ", is described by the euclidean path integral @xcite . it is not easy to calculate the whole path integral ; however , if we only restrict to the on - shell solutions ( instantons ) , then we can approximately obtain the wave function . in many contexts ,",
    "instantons are useful to study non - perturbative phenomena of the universe .",
    "for example , the coleman - deluccia instanton @xcite is useful to describe the inhomogeneous vacuum decaying process , while the hawking - moss instanton @xcite is used to describe the homogeneous tunneling process .",
    "one interesting observation is that the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation corresponds to the hawking - moss instanton @xcite .",
    "the question is that _ is this correspondence an accident or not ? _",
    "if there is no gravity , we can find many examples that a solution of the fokker - planck equation is indeed a solution of the schrodinger equation @xcite .",
    "however , it is not trivial if we include gravitation .",
    "can we still extend this relation in the presence of gravity ?    in this paper , keeping in mind this problem , we suggest three questions :    * if the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation and the ground state of the superposition of the instantons are ( approximately ) the same , what is the euclidean instanton that corresponds to a certain state for the stationary solution ? * we already know that if the field is almost static , two approaches give the same results .",
    "then , what will happen if the field begins to move ? even for this limit , are these two approaches the same ? * if we increase the curvature of the potential ( increase the mass around the local minimum ) , the stochastic description will breakdown .",
    "what is the corresponding phenomena in the euclidean side ?    to investigate these issues , in section  [ sec : sto ] and section  [ sec : euc ] , we discuss the basics of the stochastic approach and the euclidean approach . in section",
    "[ sec : the ] , we compare two approaches and discuss the first observations of both approaches . in section  [ sec : com ] , we compare the details of two approaches , and we will answer the previous questions .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : con ] , we summarize our discussions .",
    "let us assume the einstein gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field : @xmath0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider a quadratic potential , @xmath1 and we only consider the small field limit : @xmath2",
    ". then one can approximate that the hubble parameter @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "the basic motivation of the stochastic approach comes from this observation : one can define a minimal length @xmath4 or a maximal momentum @xmath5 , and if the potential is broad and the field value is sufficiently small , then we can treat the wavelengths longer than @xmath6 as a classical and locally homogeneous field , while we can treat wavelengths shorter than @xmath6 as a gaussian random noise to the longer wavelengths .",
    "in other words , our universe is homogeneous up to the length scale @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in this approximation , we can use the homogeneous metric ansatz : @xmath7 to describe shorter region than @xmath6 .",
    "now , the homogeneous universe ( up to the length @xmath6 ) will behave by a homogeneous quantum fluctuation of the scalar field ; the field now only depends on time and looks like a random walking , or looks like a stochastic process .    in the following subsections",
    ", we will sketch the systematics of the stochastic approach .      by introducing the conformal time @xmath8 and defining a scalar field as @xmath9",
    ", one has the equation of motion for @xmath10 as @xmath11 where a prime is the derivative with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "this has the general solution @xmath13 e^{i \\textbf{k } \\cdot \\textbf{x}}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 satisfies @xmath15 and is normalized such that @xmath16 the quantization condition is reduced to @xmath17 = \\delta^3(\\textbf{k } - \\textbf{l}).\\ ] ] note that the @xmath18 is a comoving momentum ; the physical momentum can be represented by @xmath19 .    in de sitter space , @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "hence , @xmath21 and @xmath22 then equation  ( [ eq : varphi_t ] ) becomes @xmath23 on the scales well inside the horizon , @xmath24 , this equation reduces to @xmath25 which has the normalized solution @xmath26 if the inflationary expansion has been going on for a sufficiently long time , the scalar field should be in the usual flat space vacuum state on scales well inside the horizon .",
    "therefore , we should take @xmath27 so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the usual flat space annihilation and creation operators , and the state should be @xmath30 where @xmath31",
    ". we are free to take @xmath32 to get @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "since the solution of equation  ( [ eq : varphi_eta ] ) should be reduced into the above in the sub - horizon limit , the solution is expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 hence , on the scales well outside the horizon , @xmath37 the asymptotic form of the solution is given as @xmath38 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k } } ( -k \\eta)^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\nu}.\\ ] ]    this allows us to rewrite the super - horizon fourier modes , i.e. , those with @xmath39 , as @xmath40 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k } } ( -k \\eta)^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 therefore , we can observe @xmath42 = 0,\\ ] ] and so the super - horizon fourier modes are classical gaussian random variables with @xmath43    to summarize , if we consider only the super - horizon fourier modes ( @xmath44 , or @xmath45 ; equivalently , @xmath46 ) , we can describe the universe as a _ locally _ homogeneous universe and the scalar field stochastically behaves as the classical gaussian random walking .",
    "this is the reason why we call this method the stochastic approach .",
    "now we calculate the dispersion of @xmath47 : @xmath48 this integral in itself has a divergence as @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we need to introduce some sort of ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath50 . this is consistent with our stochastic approach ; we consider only the super - horizon fourier modes so that @xmath51",
    ". then , the momentum cutoff @xmath52 or physical momentum cutoff @xmath53 corresponds to the smoothing length scale ( the minimal length of the relevant wave ) @xmath54 that determines how to coarse - grain the momentum space .",
    "hence , the integration can be expanded as follows : @xmath55 then , by assuming @xmath56 , this is expanded as @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and hence @xmath59",
    ". this can be absorbed by a new momentum scale @xmath60 . for future convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath61 and rewrite it as follows : @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although the dispersion @xmath63 is a specific quantity , this is indeed a representative value of the stochastic approach , since the probability distribution of the statistical ensemble can be approximated , in general , @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the field value of the purely classical trajectory , if @xmath66 . therefore , in the stationary state",
    ", the dispersion @xmath67 ( around the local minimum @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) will be a time - independent value , and , for a small field value @xmath47 , the dispersion will determine the approximate distribution of the fields .",

    "this satisfies the regular initial conditions : @xmath82 we want to analytically continue to the lorentzian manifold using @xmath83 .",
    "then at the turning point @xmath84 , we have to impose @xmath85 from the analyticity of complex functions . unless @xmath86",
    ", we should have complex valued functions for @xmath47 and @xmath87 for the lorentzian time @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we can analytically continue at @xmath89 ; then we can maintain real valued functions for all @xmath90 and @xmath88 .    in this case , the on - shell action becomes @xmath91 if this instanton mediates a tunneling from a local minimum @xmath92 to a local maximum @xmath93 of a potential , then we can define the tunneling probability : @xmath94 this is known as the hawking - moss instanton @xcite .",
    "we can generalize these real - valued instantons to complex valued functions .",
    "of course , for a long lorentzian time , we expect that all functions should become real .",
    "this condition is called the _ classicality condition _ @xcite . because of the analytic continuation to complex functions , the action is , in general , complex , so that @xmath95 = a[a,\\chi ] e^{i s[a,\\chi ] } \\label{eq : class}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 real .",
    "if the rate of change of @xmath97 is much greater than that of @xmath98 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the canonical variables , then the wave function describes almost classical behavior .",
    "we require initial conditions ( equation  [ eq : initial ] ) for regularity and , at the junction time @xmath84 , we paste @xmath101 and @xmath102 to @xmath103 and @xmath104 as in equations  ( [ eq : paste ] ) and ( [ eq : paste2 ] ) .",
    "the remaining initial conditions are the initial field value @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a positive value and @xmath107 is a phase angle . after fixing @xmath106 , by tuning the two parameters @xmath107 and the turning point @xmath108",
    ", we will try to satisfy the classicality condition @xcite@xcite .",
    "if there exists a classical history , then we can calculate a meaningful probability for a classical universe .",
    "one can study the probability via fuzzy instantons by an approximate way @xcite : around the local minimum of the potential @xmath109 the starting point is the following approximate solutions of the equations of motion : @xmath110 in which the scalar field @xmath47 slowly rolls . if the scalar field rolls more slowly , then we can further approximate @xmath111    we choose the integration contour in two steps . @xmath112",
    "we integrate in the euclidean time direction from @xmath113 to @xmath114 so that the imaginary part of @xmath47 vanishes .",
    "@xmath115 at the turning point @xmath84 , we turn to the lorentzian time direction .    using this contour of integration",
    ", the euclidean action can be calculated .",
    "note that , if the classicality condition is valid , the real part of the action @xmath116 picks up the biggest contribution during the euclidean time integration . using equation  ( [ approx2 ] ) , we can calculate the euclidean action and the result is @xmath117 therefore , as the vacuum energy becomes smaller and smaller , the probability gets larger and larger .",

    "this shows that after the turning point , the imaginary part of the euclidean action quickly varies , while the real part of the euclidean action that contributes to the probability extremely slowly varies ; this is a clear signature of the classicality .",
    "after we find classicalized histories for various @xmath106 , we can see the probability distribution as a function of @xmath120 ( right of figure  [ fig : action ] ) .",
    "this fits well with the analytic calculations .",
    "in previous sections , we discussed two independent approaches : the stochastic approach and the euclidean approach . in both cases",
    ", we assumed einstein gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field and a quadratic potential .",
    "what we compare in detail is the dispersion of the field @xmath121 in both of the approaches .",
    "however , now the crucial question is this : _ why do we have to compare two results , while two approaches seem to describe different physical situations by different methods ?",
    "_ does the comparison make sense ?",
    "there is no trivial way to justify this , because we do not know the totality of the stochastic universe ( multiverse ) and also we do not know the full quantum gravity ( even for the euclidean version ) .",
    "however , it is not unreasonable to believe ( or , assume as a working hypotheses ) that the euclidean path integral describes a ground state wave function of the universe , while the stochastic approach describes the probability distribution of the scalar field due to the stochastic random walking , or the statistical distribution of various ensembles that is generated by stochastic inflation . as in simple examples of brownian motion , the stationary state of the probability distribution due to the stochastic random walking can correspond to the ground state of the schrodinger equation @xcite .",
    "this is the basic motivation of the comparison .",
    "let us discuss it in further detail .",
    "we state again on our general intuitions between two approaches :    1 .   the _ stochastic approach _ describes the probability distribution of quantum states , or statistical distribution of many ensembles . after a sufficiently long time",
    ", the distribution will approach the _",
    "equilibrium_/__stationary state _",
    "_ limit , although there can be some time - independent state that is not the @xmath122 limit . ] . in this limit",
    ", we think that the system approaches the _ ground state_. 2 .",
    "the _ euclidean path integral _ describes the _ ground state wave function_. the ground state wave function is a superposition of many _",
    "each history is approximated by _",
    "instantons_.    if we know the sound quantum descriptions , then we _ hypothesize _ the two expectations :    expectation 1 : : :    if there is a state for certain physical properties in the stationary    state , then _ there is an instanton _ for the physical properties that    has the same probability .",
    "expectation 2 : : :    the modulus square of the ground state wave function corresponds to    the probability distribution of the stationary state .      for a realistic comparison , we need to clarify more details on each side .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath121 is much clearer in the stochastic side ; it is a statistical distribution of the scalar field around the local minimum .",
    "however , what about the euclidean side",
    "?    a schematic diagram of @xmath123 $ ] . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : scheme ] represents the schematic diagram that happens in the wave function .",
    "the wave function is approximated by superposition of classical histories ( instantons ) : thick black arrows @xmath124 , @xmath125 , ... , etc .",
    "each instanton begins from no - boundary @xmath126 ( black dashed line ) , turns to the lorentzian time @xmath127 ( red dashed line ) , and is eventually classicalized ( around the blue dashed line ) . vertical and horizontal lines conceptually represent the field space ( minisuperspace ) . for de sitter - like spaces , we can approximate the minisuperspace as vertically increasing as the scale factor or @xmath128 increases while horizontally increasing as @xmath47 varies .",
    "the probability is determined for each history .",
    "we can write the probability as a function of @xmath129 $ ] at a certain slice @xmath130 or @xmath131 , i.e. , @xmath132_{t_{o}}$ ] .",
    "although the probability is fixed for each history , the functional dependence between @xmath132_{t_{o}=a}$ ] and @xmath132_{t_{o}=b}$ ] can be different .",
    "this is easy to see , if the field slowly rolls ; there is a one - to - one correspondence between the time and the scalar field or the scale factor , and it can be simplified as follows : @xmath133=\\psi[\\phi[\\rho]]=\\psi[\\phi]_{t_{o}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , what we will see for a given quadratic potential is the following . in the stochastic approach , there are many ensembles",
    ". each observer will experience brownian random walking ; however , in the thermal equilibrium , the number of events for a certain field value @xmath47 can be maintained at an almost constant value . in this case , @xmath63 is the dispersion of the statistical distribution . on the other hand , in the euclidean approach , there are many histories",
    ". each history corresponds a creation of a universe that has a certain field value @xmath104 from nothing . for all histories",
    ", we can cut a certain slice .",
    "the slice should be labeled by a canonical variable , e.g. , @xmath134 ; we call @xmath135 the observing time .",
    "then , we can write the wave function as a function of canonical variables . in this case",
    ", @xmath63 is the dispersion of the modulus square of the wave function .    here",
    ", one interesting observation is that in both of approaches , there is ambiguity for @xmath63 .",
    "in the stochastic approach , there is the smoothing scale @xmath52 dependence . on the other hand , in the euclidean approach",
    ", there is the observing time @xmath135 dependence .    in the present paper , we will compare the dispersion @xmath63 in both approaches , stochastic and euclidean approaches , not only to the leading order , but also the second order and more .    1 .",
    "from expectation 1 , we can find the nature of the corresponding instanton in the euclidean side , if two approaches give the same results .",
    "2 .   from expectation 2 , in addition ,",
    "if the results of both approaches are the same , then this will be reduced to the comparison between the ambiguities of @xmath52 and @xmath135 .",
    "we can see whether it physically makes sense or not ; if it physically makes sense , then we can be sure that we are going in the right direction .",
    "note that one can rewrite the probability as the gaussian form ( this is valid for a small field region ) : @xmath136 we can compare with the euclidean action ( equation  ( [ eq : fuzzyaction ] ) ) : @xmath137 note that the constant term is the normalization constant in the exponential .",
    "therefore , we can identify that @xmath138 thus , this corresponds to the leading term of the result of the stochastic approach ( equation  ( [ eq : stocha ] ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to focus on the extreme case @xmath139 .",
    "then , the dispersion diverges , and the probability distribution as a solution of the fokker - planck equation spreads over the field space .",
    "this is intuitively true , since there should be no special position . on the euclidean side , if @xmath139 , then the probability for any field value is the same with @xmath140 .",
    "hence , if we consider the normalization , again , the probability distribution spreads over the field space .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that two approaches are consistent even for the trivial case @xmath139 .",
    "note that the result in equation  ( [ eq : fuzzyaction ] ) is similar to the probability for the hawking - moss instantons .",
    "in addition , people already know that the probability of the hawking - moss instanton is indeed a stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation that comes from the stochastic langevin equations .",
    "therefore , the leading term correspondence is not a new observation .",
    "however , up to now , people did not worry about this aspect of the correspondence between two pictures ( the stochastic approach and the euclidean approach ) .",
    "if the ground state wave function corresponds to the probability distribution of stochastic inflation ( the solution of the fokker - planck equation ) , then for a given state of the solution of the fokker - planck equation , there should be a corresponding _ instanton _ in the euclidean side , since the euclidean wave function is approximated by the superposition of instantons .",
    "now , our question is this : _ what is the corresponding instanton for a quadratic potential ? _",
    "one candidate is the real valued instantons ( hawking - moss instantons ) .",
    "however , the real valued instanton is impossible unless there is a point @xmath141 such that @xmath142 .",
    "it is possible only at a local minimum .",
    "therefore , the real valued instantons are not suitable .",
    "the answer is that _ it should be a complexified instanton _ ( or so - called fuzzy instanton ) .",
    "if the stochastic approach is more physical than the euclidean approach ( the euclidean approach is a rather mathematical one ) , this shows that _ there is a corresponding reality for a fuzzy instanton_. up to now , it was unclear whether the fuzzy instanton has the physical meaning or it is just a mathematical illusion .",
    "now , the leading term correspondence shows that the fuzzy instanton is not an illusion but a physical reality .",
    "we can extend our assertions , not only to the leading term ( that is already known ) , but also to the next term ( that is not yet investigated ) to search a non - trivial correspondence .      for a given quadratic potential ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 )",
    ", one can define a rescaling : @xmath145 then we can obtain the action rescaling @xmath146 and the rescaled potential @xmath147 therefore , without loss of generality , we can choose @xmath148 , and finally one can restore the results . in this subsection , we will choose @xmath149 .      to obtain the second - order contribution",
    ", we suggest that the action looks like @xmath150 from the numerical observations , we can show that @xmath151 only depends on @xmath135 and does not depend on @xmath152 or @xmath106 ( figures  [ fig : xdependence ] and [ fig : mudependence ] ) , at least , for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "in addition , numerical observations show that @xmath155 almost _ linearly _ depends on the observing time @xmath135 , where @xmath135 is the _ observation time after the turning point_. the intercept of this linear approximation is nearly zero .",

    "what is the meaning of the finite size of the universe @xmath87 ?",
    "what is the outside of @xmath87 ?",
    "after the comparison to the stochastic approach , we can say clearer statement : @xmath87 corresponds our _ coarse - graining lattice _ when we approximate that the entire universe is locally ( not globally ) homogeneous .",
    "finally , we consider the situation @xmath194 .",
    "then , @xmath195 ( equation  [ eq : nu ] ) becomes imaginary . in the stochastic side ,",
    "if @xmath195 is imaginary , it can be interpreted that longer wavelength modes begin to oscillate and the long wavelength modes no longer dominate , so results depend strongly on any smoothing scale .",
    "therefore , once @xmath195 turns imaginary , the long wavelength modes can no longer be considered approximately classical .    on the other hand , according to hartle , hawking , and hertog @xcite , one may find an interesting correspondence in the euclidean side .",
    "let us first observe the perturbative discussion in @xcite .",
    "to study the first perturbative level , we fix the background metric as follows : @xmath196 then , the equation for the scalar field becomes @xmath197 in general , the solution @xmath198 with the property @xmath199 and @xmath200 becomes @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the hypergeometric function and @xmath203 then , using the function @xmath198 , one can construct the function @xmath47 with a certain final field value @xmath204 or @xmath205 by @xmath206 therefore , whenever we impose @xmath72 as a real valued function , the initial phase angle @xmath207 is determined .",
    "in other words , if the condition @xmath208 is satisfied for a sufficiently large @xmath88 , then we can redefine the phase angle @xmath107 so that we can construct a realized field solution . however ,",
    "if it does not converge to a constant , then there is no hope to tune @xmath107 to construct a realized field solution .",
    "note that the equations for the real part @xmath209 and the imaginary part @xmath210 along the large lorentzian time effectively become @xmath211 to satisfy the reality condition , equation  ( [ eq : condition ] ) , we require that equations  ( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) should not be oscillatory ; while if these are oscillatory , equation  ( [ eq : condition ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "note that equations  ( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) are just simple damped harmonic oscillators , and these are overdamped if @xmath212 , underdamped if @xmath194 , and critically damped if @xmath213 . the underdamped condition corresponds to the case when the real and imaginary parts are both oscillatory and difficult to classicalize .",
    "therefore , if @xmath194 , then there is a cutoff @xmath214 such that the _ classicality condition _ is unstable around the local minimum .",
    "now , we summarize the logical flow :    1 .   for the underdamped region @xmath215 , the real part and the imaginary part of the field oscillate around the local minimum .",
    "therefore , there is no classical history , or the classicality is inevitably related to the oscillation of the fields .",
    "2 .   for the same region @xmath215 , longer wavelength modes can not be regarded classical and the local ( hubble scale ) _ homogeneity _ is violated .",
    "therefore , for highly curved potentials @xmath215 , the classicalization is related to the oscillation of the fields .",
    "the oscillation of fields will be related to _",
    "inhomogeneity _ and _ instability of classicality_. we leave further details for future work .",
    "in this paper , we compare the two approaches .",
    "one is the quantum field theory in a de sitter background ; the so - called stochastic inflation .",
    "the other is the euclidean quantum gravity using fuzzy instantons .",
    "the former describes a probability distribution of a random walking field and a solution of the fokker - planck equation , while the latter is the wave function of the ground state of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "we expect that the stationary state of the probability distribution should correspond to the modulus square of the ground state wave function .    for practical comparison , we compared the dispersion of the field , where this is indeed representative in both approaches .",
    "we integrate three important conclusions :    leading order : : :    they match well ( section  [ sec:1st ] ) .",
    "this implies that the fuzzy    ( complex - valued ) instanton is indeed the corresponding instanton on    the euclidean side , while there is no real - valued instanton .",
    "second order : : :    still two approaches are the same ( section  [ sec:2nd ] ) .",
    "this implies    that the size of the universe on the euclidean approach corresponds to    the smoothing scale size of the stochastic approach . in the stochastic    approach ,",
    "the universe is homogeneous up to the length scale    @xmath216 , and this is the size of the scale    factor of the euclidean approach @xmath87 .",
    "large @xmath179 limit : : :    if the curvature of the potential around the local minimum is    sufficiently large , then the potential should satisfy the underdamped    condition .",
    "then , the classicality in the euclidean approach is related    to the oscillation of the field , and this is related to inhomogeneity    in the stochastic approach ( section  [ sec:3rd ] ) .",
    "one interesting comparison is that the stochastic inflation can realize all the possible quantum states during inflation .",
    "therefore , this can realize statistical ensembles .",
    "the euclidean side introduces a wave function , while the stochastic side can correspond to a statistical system . if our knowledge about quantum mechanics , the so - called _ _ born rule _",
    "_ , is sound , then the present work corresponds to born s rule of the _ quantum gravitational version_.    our comparison shows that there are non - trivial correspondences between the euclidean approach and the stochastic approach . in this paper , we go over the previous discussions in the two points .",
    "first , fuzzy instantons are not only mathematical , but also corresponds to something in nature . in other words , fuzzy instantons are realized by stochastic inflation .",
    "second , the finite size of the universe of the instantons in the no - boundary measure indeed has physical meaning from the stochastic inflation .",
    "this is the boundary of the homogeneous approximation , a grid size of the stochastic approach",
    ". these can be good indirect evidences that the euclidean quantum gravity and quantum cosmology go in the right direction .",
    "in addition , we expect that there should be more relations even beyond the slow - roll limits .",
    "we leave the detailed analysis for future work .",
    "the authors would like to thank hanno sahlmann , robert brandenberger , erick weinberg , soo a kim , and wonwoo lee for helpful discussions .",
    "dy , bhl , and dh were supported by the national research foundation grant ( 2005 - 0049409 ) funded by the korean government through the center for quantum spacetime(cquest ) of sogang university .",
    "eds and hz were supported by the national research foundation grant ( 2009 - 0077503 ) funded by the korean government .",
    "there is no real - valued instanton except the local minimum of the quadratic potential .",
    "however , we can find a complex - valued instanton for general field values .",
    "once we generalize to complex - valued functions , then we have eight initial conditions : the real part and imaginary part of @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 . among these conditions ,",
    "we already fix six of them , since we require the regularity of @xmath126 : @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 .",
    "then , there remain two initial conditions : @xmath224 , where @xmath106 is the modulus of the initial field position and @xmath107 is the phase angle .",
    "in addition , we have to choose a turning point @xmath108 from the euclidean time @xmath90 to the lorentzian time @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , for a complex - valued instanton with a given @xmath106 , we still have undefined two - dimensional degrees of freedom : @xmath225 .",
    "we have to impose the classicality for a given complex - valued instanton , since it should return to a classical universe for a sufficiently large @xmath88 .",
    "this is implemented by tuning @xmath107 and @xmath108 . to find a classical fuzzy instanton , therefore ,",
    "we need parameter tuning for @xmath107 and @xmath108 ; the purpose of the tuning is to minimize @xmath226 for this purpose , we first try to find candidates of @xmath107 and @xmath108 that minimize an objective function ( this can be chosen freely for our technical conveniences ) . for example",
    ", we minimize the objective function , @xmath227 \\equiv \\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2 } } \\left| \\frac{\\mathcal{l}^{\\mathfrak{re}}_{\\phi_{0}}[\\theta , x](t ) } { \\mathcal{l}_{\\phi_{0}}[\\theta , x](t)}\\right| dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath228(t)$ ] is the lagrangian with a given initial field modulus @xmath106 . @xmath229 and @xmath230 are sufficiently large time values when we measure the lagrangian and are introduced for technical conveniences . of course , in general , the candidates @xmath107 and @xmath108 do not imply the classicality .",
    "hence , we have to check again whether @xmath231 and @xmath232 for a sufficiently large @xmath88 .",
    "to summarize , the searching algorithm finds the best candidate of the fuzzy instanton .",
    "we should check whether this candidate is indeed a classicalized fuzzy instanton or not .",
    "if it is so , then we can say that there is a fuzzy instanton , it has a certain action , etc .",
    "if one of the conditions @xmath231 or @xmath232 does not hold , then we should conclude that there is no fuzzy instanton for a given initial condition @xmath106 .    to optimize the objective function @xmath233",
    ", we used the well - known genetic algorithm .",
    "the technical details are discussed in @xcite .",
    "after we find all the fuzzy instantons , we can discuss the action @xmath116 as a function of @xmath106 .",
    "after we fix a fitting form such as equation  ( [ eq : actionform ] ) , we can discuss further details on the dispersion .",
