    "on heating glassy silica it crystallises into a crystalline form called cristoballite , but the equilibrium crystalline form is tridymite @xcite .",
    "the silica has two crystalline forms and it transforms into the metastable form , not the equilibrium form .",
    "phase transformations into metastable phases are quite common , and systems that do this are sometimes said to obey the ostwald or ostwald step rule @xcite .",
    "typically the appearance of the less stable phase is ascribed to it being in some way more similar to the original phase it nucleated in than is the equilibrium phase and so having a lower interfacial tension with the original phase . within classical nucleation theory",
    "the nucleation rate is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the interfacial tension between the nucleating phase and the phase it is nucleating in and @xmath2 is proportional to the difference in chemical potential between the nucleating phase and the phase it is nucleating in @xcite .",
    "thus , although @xmath2 will be larger for the nucleation of the equilibrium phase , if the interfacial tension @xmath1 for this phase is also larger its rate of nucleation may be slower than that of a metastable phase .",
    "this argument is based on the nucleation of the new phases being homogeneous , i.e. , occurring in the bulk",
    ". however , the nucleation of most new phases is not homogeneous but heterogeneous , it takes place in contact with impurities , or with the surface of the container @xcite .",
    "this implies that which phase nucleates first may be influenced by differences in the interactions of the nuclei of the different phases with the impurities present . here",
    ", we use computer simulation and theory to demonstrate that indeed impurities can determine which phase appears .",
    "we find that if we start with a system in which the equilibrium phase nucleates , we can change only the nature of the impurity and obtain a system in which the metastable phase nucleates .",
    "we study nucleation in the potts lattice model @xcite , via monte carlo computer simulation .",
    "this model is one of the simplest models that has the three phases we require .",
    "thus we will try to obtain an understanding of the generic features of nucleation under conditions when there is more than one phase that is more stable than the existing phase and when there are impurities present .",
    "we hope our conclusions will apply widely to systems where there are competing phases that the system can transform into .",
    "the nucleus of a new phase is typically only a few molecules ( in the case of the potts model : spins ) across and so even impurities only a few molecules or spins across are large enough to greatly reduce the free - energy barrier to nucleation ; see for example @xcite . here",
    "we will study impurities only a few spins across , although we could have studied much larger impurities .",
    "we defer a systematic study of the effect of varying the impurity size to later work .",
    "see e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein for recent simulation work on heterogeneous nucleation .    in the next section",
    "we define a simple model that has the required three phases .",
    "the third section contains the results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "these simulations are exact and demonstrate that the nature of the impurity can indeed determine which phase nucleates . having established this , we do not go on and systematically vary parameters such as the size , shape etc .  of the nucleus . instead ,",
    "in the fourth section we write down a simple phenomenological theory for the competitive nucleation of two phases , one of which is assisted by an impurity , i.e. , the nucleation is heterogeneous , and the other of which is not and so nucleates via homogeneous nucleation .",
    "this allows us to calculate how much an impurity needs to reduce the barrier to nucleation in order to determine which phase nucleates , as a function of the density of impurities , the interfacial tensions between the phases etc .",
    "the final section is a conclusion , where we discuss the relevance to experiment .",
    "consider the three - state potts model @xcite on a simple cubic lattice in three dimensions . on each lattice site",
    "@xmath3 there is a spin @xmath4 that can take one of three values : 1 , 2 or 3 , and that interacts with its six nearest neighbours .",
    "the interaction energy of a pair of neighbouring spins @xmath3 and @xmath5 is @xmath6 , i.e. , the only interaction is between spins that have the same spin value .",
    "@xmath7 is positive , so on cooling the model undergoes a symmetry - breaking transition from a state in which a third of the spins have each spin value to one of three ordered phases , in each of which one of the spin values predominates @xcite .",
    "these are the spin - one , spin - two and spin - three phases . in the absence of any external fields",
    "all three phases have the same free energy .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath8 @xcite . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are boltzmann s constant and the temperature , respectively .",
    "here we work solely at the low temperature @xmath11 .",
    "we will consider not the disorder - order transition but transitions between the three ordered phases .",
    "to do so we need to consider external fields that break the symmetry between these phases .",
    "the three external fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 , couple to the spins via terms @xmath14 , i.e. , a positive @xmath12 favours the phase with spins predominantly taking the value @xmath9 . if , for example , the @xmath12 have values @xmath15 , then the spin - three phase is the equilibrium phase and the spin - two phase is more stable than the spin - one phase",
    ". we will always start in the spin - one phase and always set @xmath16 .",
    "then by increasing @xmath17 and @xmath18 from zero we will make both the spin - two and spin - three phases more stable than the spin - one phase .",
    "we also require an impurity that favours either the spin - two or the spin - three phase .",
    "we use an impurity that is a square monolayer of @xmath19 by @xmath19 spins that are fixed and that interact with adjacent spins with an energy @xmath20 , where when @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) we have an impurity with a strong affinity for the spin - two ( spin - three ) phase . see figure",
    "[ snap ] for a snapshot showing the impurity .",
    "we refer to the spins that can flip between the three values as free spins to distinguish them from the fixed spins that form the impurity . at the temperature we work at the interaction between the fixed spins of the impurity and the free spins",
    "is strong enough that if the impurity is expanded into an infinite plane wetting occurs .",
    "see for example @xcite for an introduction to wetting .",
    "for example , if @xmath21 , at equilibrium at coexistence , @xmath23 , impurities in either spin - one or spin - three phases are wet by the spin - two phase . in between the ,",
    "infinite , impurity and the bulk phase there will be a macroscopic layer of the spin - two phase and then an interface between the spin - two phase and either the spin - one or spin - three phase .",
    "we verified this via computer simulation .",
    "putting all the interactions together the energy of a configuration of the spins is @xmath24 the first , dashed , sum is over all nearest - neighbour pairs of free spins .",
    "the two sums in the middle terms are over the three applied fields and over all spins .",
    "the double - dashed sum in the last term is over all free spins adjacent to the impurity .",
    "we simulate using the standard metropolis monte carlo method for spins .",
    "each move starts by selecting one of the free spins at random .",
    "this spin is then flipped to either of the two other spin states with equal probability . if this flip lowers the energy it is always accepted , if it increases the energy it is accepted with a probability that is the exponential of minus negative of the energy change over @xmath25 .",
    "see @xcite for an introduction to the monte carlo method .",
    "our simulations were done on a lattice of 30 by 30 by 30 spins with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is a somewhat larger lattice than shown in the snapshot of figure [ snap ] .",
    "the appearance of a new phase was determined by monitoring the fraction of spin - twos and spin - threes .",
    "once the fraction of spin - twos exceeded 45% the simulation was stopped and the spin - two phase was taken to have nucleated .",
    "similarly , if the fraction of spin - threes exceeded 45% the spin - three phase was taken to have nucleated .",
    "see figure [ s23 ] for a plot of the fractions of spins that were spin - twos and spin - threes as a function of simulation time , for one simulation run .",
    "the fraction 45% is arbitrary , varying it even by large amounts does not change the result in almost all cases . note that then there are over ten thousand spins in the new phase so the nucleus is clearly post - critical , it is extremely unlikely that its growth will stop . in most cases we repeated the simulation five times with the same values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but near the borderlines between different nucleation behaviours we performed ten simulation runs . if neither the spin - two nor the spin - three phase nucleated within 100,000 cycles , the simulation was abandoned .",
    "there the nucleation rate is too low to be measured via direct simulation .",
    "we start all our simulations by setting @xmath23 and then equilibrating the system in the spin - one phase . for our first simulations",
    "we then instantaneously increased both @xmath17 and @xmath18 to @xmath26 .",
    "the spin - two and spin - three phases are then equally stable , and more stable than the spin - one phase .",
    "we found that if the simulation box contains a @xmath21 impurity , which has an affinity for the spin - two phase , then the spin - two phase nucleates , whereas if the box contains a @xmath22 impurity , then the spin - three phase appears @xcite .",
    "if @xmath18 is increased to @xmath27 , keeping @xmath28 , then with a @xmath21 impurity the spin - two phase still appears not the spin - three phase , even though the spin - three phase is now more stable . as we expect if at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the @xmath21 impurity is replaced by a @xmath22 impurity it is the spin - three phase that appears .",
    "so , it is the impurity that is controlling which phase appears .",
    "this is the key result of this work . in table",
    "[ table1 ] along the diagonal , i.e. , @xmath30 , and also even for @xmath31 , it is always the spin - two phase that appears .",
    "however , returning to a system with a @xmath21 impurity , if while @xmath17 is kept at @xmath26 , @xmath18 is further increased to @xmath32 , it is the spin - three phase that nucleates .",
    "as the stability of the equilibrium phase with respect to that of the metastable phase is increased , by increasing @xmath33 , beyond a certain limit our impurity no longer controls the phase that forms . for @xmath28 and @xmath34 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 impurities both",
    "result in the spin - three phase forming .",
    "results for a number of different values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "these results are for a @xmath21 impurity .",
    "of course , due to the symmetry of the model , results for a @xmath22 impurity can be obtained by simply swapping the labels 2 and 3 in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".results of computer simulations of a system of @xmath35 potts spins at @xmath11 with a @xmath21 square impurity @xmath19 spins along each side . starting with a system equilibrated in the spin - one phase at @xmath23 the system has @xmath17 and @xmath18 instantaneously increased to the values shown .",
    "formation of the spin - two phase is indicated by a ` 2 ' and formation of the spin - three phase by a ` 3 ' .",
    "a ` 0 ' indicates that neither phase nucleated within 100,000 cycles .",
    "the ` 2/3 ' indicates that of 10 simulation runs 3 resulted in the spin - two phase and 7 in the spin - three phase . here the barriers to formation of these two phases are comparable . finally , @xmath36 indicates that both the spin - three and the spin - two phase nucleated but that it was the fraction of spin - threes that grew to exceed 45% . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    stranski and totomanow @xcite argued that when a system is in a phase which has a higher free energy than more than one other phase the phase that nucleates is the one with the lowest nucleation barrier .",
    "we agree , but as nucleation is typically heterogeneous , which phase has the lowest barrier will depend on what impurities are present , as well as on properties of the phase itself . as an example , consider increasing the size of the impurity .",
    "if the impurity is expanded into an infinite plane , then it will be wet by the spin - two phase .",
    "thus , if the impurity is large enough then the spin - two phase will nucleate effectively at @xmath37 as already at this value of @xmath17 a macroscopic wetting layer of the spin - two phase will be present on the surface of a macroscopic impurity .",
    "thus , if such a large impurity is present the spin - three phase will only get a chance to nucleate in the spin - one phase if the spin - two phase is actually higher in free energy than the spin - one phase , @xmath38 .",
    "note that if @xmath18 is sufficiently large the spin - three phase may of course nucleate from the spin - two phase .",
    "a sufficiently large impurity with a surface wet by a new phase can reduce the nucleation barrier to zero , even at coexistence , where the barrier to homogeneous nucleation is divergent @xcite . alternatively , if a dilute impurity does not prefer the nucleating phase it will not participate in nucleation . denoting the barriers to homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ,",
    "the magnitude of the difference @xmath41 is then defined by @xmath42 ; it is the free energy difference between the critical nuclei . for a sufficiently large impurity with a surface that is wet when the surface is infinite , @xmath41 can be made arbitrarily large .",
    "it can also be effectively zero .",
    "note that @xmath41 will in general be a complex function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 because impurities will change the shape and size of the critical nucleus .",
    "we would like to explore the nucleation behaviour for the parameter space composed of the driving forces for nucleation of the spin - two and spin - three phases , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the effect of the impurity , @xmath41 . for simplicity",
    ", we will only consider @xmath21 impurities that favour the spin - two phase , and we will neglect homogeneous nucleation of the spin - two phase . thus we will consider only the competition between homogeneous nucleation of the spin - three phase and heterogeneous nucleation of the spin - two phase .",
    "it is easy to relax this constraint but it introduces additional variables without changing the qualitative nature of the behaviour . exploring the parameter space via computer simulation would be very laborious but fortunately classical nucleation theory @xcite should be accurate enough for this purpose .",
    "classical nucleation theory has been shown to be very reasonable for homogeneous nucleation in the ising model well below this model s critical temperature , where the transition is strongly first - order as it is here , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will start with the classical nucleation theory @xcite for homogeneous nucleation of the spin - three phase in the spin - one phase .",
    "although this is a little inaccurate we consider nuclei to be always perfectly cubic , i.e. , to consist of @xmath43 by @xmath43 by @xmath43 spins .",
    "the free energy change on forming a nucleus is just the sum of a bulk term from creating a volume @xmath44 of the spin - three phase and a surface term from creating @xmath45 of spin - three  spin - one interface .",
    "then the free energy of a nucleus of the spin - three phase is @xcite @xmath46 where we used the low - temperature approximation for the interfacial tension between the spin - one and spin - three phases @xmath47 .",
    "the rate is determined by the free energy of the nucleus , equation ( [ homo ] ) , at the top of the barrier , which is @xmath48 .",
    "the rate of homogeneous nucleation of the spin - three phase , per lattice site , @xmath49 , is then @xcite @xmath50,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{r3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is an attempt frequency ; it is of the same order as the frequency of spin flips at a site .",
    "the rate of homogeneous nucleation of the spin - two phase is just that given by equation ( [ r3 ] ) with the field @xmath17 replacing @xmath18 .",
    "the interfacial tension between the spin - one and spin - two phase will be very similar to that between the spin - one and the spin - three phases at these low temperatures .",
    "then , according to the definition of @xmath41 the barrier to heterogeneous nucleation of the spin - two phase is @xmath52 .",
    "the rate of heterogeneous nucleation of the spin - two phase , per lattice site , @xmath53 , is therefore @xmath54 , \\label{r2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the number of impurities divided by the number of sites .",
    "we expect the density of impurities to be very low so we fix @xmath56 .",
    "also , for an impurity of specific material , size etc . , then @xmath41 will be a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we ignore this dependence here and treat @xmath41 as simply a shift in the nucleation barrier . having determined how large a shift is needed we can then work back to estimate the properties the impurity must have in order to generate it .",
    "let us consider systems where the difference @xmath33 is fixed , so the spin - three phase is a fixed amount more stable .",
    "then @xmath33 is one parameter , @xmath41 is the other .",
    "having fixed both these parameters we can start with @xmath57 and then increase @xmath17 and @xmath18 in parallel until the nucleation rate of either the spin - two , equation ( [ r2 ] ) , or the spin - three , equation ( [ r3 ] ) , phase becomes appreciable .",
    "the phase whose nucleation rate is the first to become appreciable will then be the one that appears .",
    "it is a little arbitrary what nucleation rate we consider to be appreciable , we select values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 per site as trial values .",
    "we can then divide the parameter space of systems in the @xmath60@xmath41 plane into a region where on increasing @xmath18 and @xmath17 at fixed @xmath33 the rate of nucleation of the spin - two phase equals @xmath58 or @xmath59 first or a region where that of the spin - three phase is the first to hit one of these values .",
    "we have done so and plotted the results in figure [ step ] ; the solid and dashed curves separate the two regions for the different nucleation rates .",
    "we see that as @xmath41 increases the spin - two phase appears first even for larger and larger values of @xmath33 , i.e. , even when the spin - three phase is more and more stable relative to the spin - two phase .",
    "impurities that strongly favour the metastable spin - two phase , i.e. , ones with large values of @xmath41 , result in the spin - two phase preempting the spin - three phase even when the spin - three phase is significantly more stable .",
    "this is true even for very low impurity densities @xmath61 .",
    "they cause this less stable phase to appear .",
    "note that in figure [ step ] , @xmath62 so our neglect of homogeneous nucleation is always reasonable as the rate of homogeneous nucleation as at least a factor @xmath63 smaller than the rate of heterogeneous nucleation . also , the trend seen in figure [ step ] from nucleation of the spin - two phase to nucleation of the spin - three phase as @xmath33 is increased is just the same as that in the results of table [ table1 ] .",
    "a given impurity only controls nucleation , in the sense of causing the metastable phase to appear , if the difference in stability between the metastable phase and the equilibrium phase is not too great .",
    "note that for the potts model , formation of the spin - two phase slows down formation of the spin - three phase .",
    "this is because the interfacial tension between the spin - two and the spin - three phase will be very similar to that between the spin - two and spin - three phases , both will be @xmath64 at low temperatures we are working at , but the driving force for nucleation from the spin - two phase is only @xmath33 not @xmath18 .",
    "in other systems , for example alkanes",
    "@xcite , formation of a metastable phase may accelerate the formation of the equilibrium phase .",
    "see @xcite for a theoretical description of that effect .",
    "it has been known since ostwald s time in the nineteenth century that when a phase has a higher free energy than two or more other phases it is often not the equilibrium one of these other phases that appears but a metastable one @xcite .",
    "this was based on experimental observations .",
    "here we have used computer simulation and a simple theory , and seen that which phase appears can be controlled by the impurities that are present .",
    "it may be that a system contains impurities that strongly favour a metastable phase .",
    "if so , then the metastable phase may nucleate on these impurities under conditions where the equilibrium phase does not nucleate , because the barrier to nucleation of the equilibrium phase is too high .",
    "thus , if we are to understand why a system obeys ostwald s rule , we may need to consider the effect of the impurities present .",
    "it should be noted that the usual explanation for ostwald s rule , that the interfacial tension for the metastable phase is lower than for the equilibrium phase , is not applicable here : these two interfacial tensions will be very similar for the low - temperature potts model .    here , we used monte carlo simulation to study heterogeneous nucleation . currently , experimental data is interpreted using the classical nucleation theory of heterogeneous nucleation @xcite , but this is often unsatisfactory , see for example @xcite .",
    "some of the assumptions that underlie the classical nucleation theory of heterogeneous nucleation are known to be poor , particularly when the impurity strongly attracts the new phase @xcite .",
    "thus computer simulation , which does not make these assumptions , is useful .",
    "experimental systems can be mapped onto the current simple model or generalisations of it if the supersaturations and interfacial tensions are known .",
    "even if the impurities in the experimental system are uncharacterised , then simulations can be performed with a range of impurities in order to make plausible estimates of how strongly the impurities in the experimental system are interacting with the nuclei .",
