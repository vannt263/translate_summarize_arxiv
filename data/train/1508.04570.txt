    "it is envisaged that spm will be created as an open - source software virtual machine , derived from the existing _ sp computer model _ ( sp71 ) , and hosted on an existing high - performance computer .",
    "spf is intended to be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the sp system and to create new versions of it .",

    "many potential benefits and applications flow from this simplification and integration , as detailed in section [ motivations_section ] and appendix [ potential_benefits_applications_appendix ] .",
    "several of those benefits and applications may be realised on relatively short timescales , as indicated in the introduction to appendix [ potential_benefits_applications_appendix ] .",
    "the sp theory was not dreamed up overnight .",
    "it is the product of about 20 years of development and testing .",
    "a central idea in the sp theory is the powerful concept of _ multiple alignment _ , borrowed and adapted from that concept in bioinformatics , and outlined in appendix [ ma_appendix ] .",
    "it appears that multiple alignment provides a key to versatility and adaptability in intelligent systems .",
    "expressing the theory in a computer model has helped to reduce vagueness in the theory , it has provided a means of testing candidate ideas ",
    "many of which have been rejected as a result of this testing  and it is a means of demonstrating what can be done with the system .",

    "these motivations are described in subsections below .",
    "probably the most distinctive feature of the sp system is the powerful concept of multiple alignment , as it has been adapted from bioinformatics ( appendix [ distinctive_features_and_advantages_appendix ] ) . in broad terms",
    ", this concept provides a key to :    * _ simplification of concepts and systems_. diverse concepts in computing and cognition may be assimilated to the relatively simple concept of multiple alignment ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section2 and 4 ) ) , and that concept can mean substantial simplifications of computing systems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.4.2 ) , ( * ? ? ? * section 5 ) ) . * _ versatility in intelligence_. the sp system has strengths in unsupervised learning , natural language processing , pattern recognition , information retrieval , several kinds of reasoning , planning , problem solving , information compression , and more @xcite . * _ adaptability in intelligence_. the sp system s strengths in unsupervised learning ( * ? ? ? * chapter 9 ) may provide a foundation for other kinds of learning ( * ? ? ? * section v ) . via unsupervised learning , and perhaps via other kinds of learning ,",
    "the system has potential to promote human - like adaptability in intelligence . *",
    "_ seamless integration of structures and functions_. the sp system , with multiple alignment centre stage , has potential to promote seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) , an integration that appears to be essential for effective reasoning and problem solving in intelligent systems .",
    "more specifically , there are many potential benefits and applications that flow from the multiple alignment concept , described in outline in appendix [ potential_benefits_applications_appendix ] and in more detail in @xcite .",
    "as noted in section [ benefits_applications_section ] , the potential value , worldwide , of those benefits and application , has been estimated to be at least $ 190 billion , _ every year_.    the estimated cost of setting up spf is @xmath0 and recurrent costs are estimated to be @xmath1 pa ( section [ costs_section ] ) .",
    "taking account of these estimated costs , and the potential benefits and applications , it appears that the proposed facility would be a good investment .",

    "the sp system has considerable potential to contribute to development of two of those `` great technologies''_big data _ ( discussed in the next subsection ) and _ robotics and autonomous systems _",
    "( discussed in section [ robotics_autonomous_section ] ) .",
    "the sp system is also relevant to development in a third area_energy_discussed briefly in section [ energy_section ] ) .    in addition , the very broad scope of the sp system ( section [ broad_scope_section ] ) , and the provision of a facility for researchers anywhere in the world ( section [ open_to_researchers_everywhere_section ] ) , is likely , via synergies of various kinds , encourage `` better science '' , `` new kinds of science '' , and `` interdisciplinary projects '' , in keeping with the government s _ a strategic vision for uk e - infrastructure_. , p.  21 . ]      outlined here are some significant challenges associated with big data and how the sp system may help to overcome them .",
    "there is a tendency amongst some people to write or speak as if big data was an unalloyed blessing and that all the necessary technologies are available to exploit it .",
    "but it is clear from the book _ smart machines _ by john",
    "kelly and steve hamm ( both of ibm ) @xcite , and also from _ frontiers in massive data analysis _ from the us national research council @xcite , that much of the potential value of big data can not be realised currently because of significant unsolved problems in that area .",
    "it is also clear from _ smart machines _ that significant problems associated with big data can not be solved by tinkering with existing designs for computers .",
    "radical rethinking of the architecture of computers will be needed , probably drawing on what we can learn about the workings of the human brain .    and",
    "achieving this transition to `` cognitive computing '' will require large - scale collaboration , as indicated in section [ theory_and_machine_section ] .",
    "spm and spf are relevant to the issues just described because : the sp system has been developed in the spirit of cognitive computing , drawing heavily on research on human perception and cognition , and neuroscience ; it offers radical solutions to problems posed by big data ; and the existence of spf would encourage and facilitate large - scale collaboration amongst researchers all around the world .    the paper _ big data and the sp theory of intelligence _",
    "@xcite describes how the sp system may help to solve nine of the problems associated with big data , as outlined in appendix [ big_data_appendix ] .",
    "three of those problems , and their potential solutions , are highlighted here :    * _ the problem of variety in big data_. there is a pressing need in computing to tame the great variety of formalisms and formats for the representation of knowledge , each with their own mode of processing .",
    "the multiple alignment framework in the sp system has clear potential as a _ universal framework for the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge _ ( ufk ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii ) . *",
    "energy consumption_. the sp system , in conjunction with the concept of `` data - centric computing '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) , has potential to `` make computers many orders of magnitude more energy efficient '' @xcite via two key principles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ix ) : 1 ) taking advantage of statistical information that the system gathers as a by - product of how it works ; 2 ) cutting out much searching by making direct connections between `` neural symbols '' in `` sp - neural '' ( appendix [ sp - neural_appendix ] ) . * _ transmission of information_. the sp system has potential to yield dramatic economies in the transmission of information , partly by making big data smaller ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section vii ) , but perhaps more importantly via analysis / synthesis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 18 ) , based on the judicious separation of _ encoding _ and _ grammar _",
    "* section viii ) .    as noted in appendix [ big_data_appendix ] , it appears that , considering the nine proposed solutions collectively , and in several cases individually , there are no alternatives that can rival the potential of what is described in @xcite .    with regard to the government s information economy strategy , .",
    "] `` the uk now has the opportunity to take a lead in the global efforts to deal with the volume , velocity and variety of data created each day .",
    "this will require continued infrastructure investment ... '' ( p.  7 ) .",
    "spf has potential to be a major plank in that infrastructure , and at modest cost ( section [ costs_section ] ) .      as mentioned above , _ robotics and autonomous systems _ is another of the government s `` eight great technologies '' where the sp system may make a contribution  perhaps via the uk robotics and autonomous systems network ( uk - ras network ) . ] or otherwise  and the potential is considerable .    in the paper _ autonomous robots and the sp theory of intelligence _",
    "@xcite , robots are `` autonomous '' if they do not depend on external intelligence or power supplies , and are mobile .",
    "it is also assumed that they are designed to exhibit as much human - like intelligence as possible .",
    "the paper describes how the sp system may contribute in three main areas :    * _ computational efficiency , the use of energy , and the size and weight of computers_. `` to field a conventional computer with [ human - like ] cognitive capacity would require gigawatts of electricity and a machine the size of a football field . ''",
    "if a robot is to be autonomous as described above , it needs a ` brain ' that is efficient enough to do all the necessary processing without external assistance , does not require an industrial - scale power station to meet its energy demands , and is small enough and light enough to be carried around  things that are difficult or impossible to achieve with current technologies .",
    "+ section iii of @xcite describes how these things may be achieved in a revised and updated version of arguments in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ix ) .",
    "the sp system may help : by reducing the size of data to be processed ; by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works ; and via a revised version of donald hebb s @xcite concept of a `` cell assembly '' . * _ towards human - like versatility in intelligence_. if a robot is to operate successfully in an environment where people can not help , or where such opportunities are limited , it needs as much as possible of the versatility in intelligence that people may otherwise provide .",
    "+ the sp system demonstrates versatility via its strengths in areas such as unsupervised learning , natural language processing , fuzzy pattern recognition and recognition at multiple levels of abstraction , best - match and semantic forms of information retrieval , several kinds of reasoning , planning , problem solving , information compression , and more ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iv ) . + but the sp system is not simply a kludge of different ai functions . owing to its focus on simplification and integration of concepts in computing and cognition ( appendix [ outline_of_sp_theory_and_model_appendix ] )",
    ", it promises to reduce or eliminate unnecessary complexity and to avoid awkward incompatibilities between poorly - integrated subsystems , as indicated in appendix [ simplification_integration_concepts_appendix ] . * . the sp system s strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help to achieve human - like adaptability in intelligence via : one - trial learning ;",
    "the learning of natural language ; learning to see ; building 3d models of objects and of a robot s surroundings ; learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot s environment ; exploration and play ; learning major skills ; and learning via demonstration ( * ? ? ? * section v ) .",
    "this new approach to the development of autonomous robots has several distinctive features ( appendix [ distinctive_features_and_advantages_appendix ] ) , especially the concept of multiple alignment .",
    "it appears that this approach has considerable potential to promote computational and energy efficiency in a robot s brain , and to achieve human - like versatility and adaptability in intelligence .",
    "the sp system may also contribute indirectly to another of the areas identified as one of the `` eight great technologies''_energy_via increases in efficiency in the workings of computers and in the transmission of data , as outlined in sections [ big_data_section ] and [ robotics_autonomous_section ] , and described more fully in ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to big data ( section [ big_data_section ] ) , robotics and autonomous systems ( section [ robotics_autonomous_section ] ) , and energy ( section [ energy_section ] ) , there are several other potential benefits and applications of the sp system , outlined in appendix [ potential_benefits_applications_appendix ] .",
    "as noted there , several of these potential benefits and applications may be realised on relatively short timescales with existing high - performance computers or even ordinary computers .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is intended that spf will facilitate the development of a high - parallel version of the sp machine , realised as an open - source software virtual machine , and hosted on an existing high - performance computer .",
    "how things may develop is shown schematically in figure [ sp_machine_figure ] .",
    "aspects of the proposal are described in the following subsections .",
    "some aspects of spf may seem unfamiliar and may , superficially , appear to conflict with funding policies .",
    "these remarks apply , in particular , to the proposal that spf should be permanent ( section [ spf_permanent_section ] ) , that it should be available to researchers anywhere in the world ( section [ open_to_researchers_everywhere_section ] ) , and that , with few if any exceptions , there should be no charges for using the facility ( section [ easy_to_access_and_to_use_section ] ) .",
    "but it appears that , at high levels , it is recognised that funding for e - infrastructure should be responsive and flexible , that it should recognise the diverse needs of the research community , and that there is a need for long - term perspectives . in support of such policies :    * `` in the roadmap , epsrc aims to ...  understand the requirements of the eps [ engineering and physical sciences ] research community that make use of e - infrastructure , ensuring there are no gaps or duplication .

    "it is envisaged that the main features of spf will be these :    * _ the sp machine , version 1_. spf will contain the first high - parallel version of the sp machine , which may be referred to as the `` sp machine , version 1 '' or `` spm1 . '' ) , we think it is probably best if the first spf version is called `` spm1 '' . ]",
    "the name `` spm '' would normally mean spm1 but , depending on the context , it may be used to refer to any other version of the sp machine or to all versions , collectively . * _ founded on the sp71 computer model_. the sp71 computer model ( appendix [ computer_model_and_sp_machine_appendix ] ) , the basis for spm , will be ported on to the host machine .",
    "this should be relatively straightforward to do since the model is written in c++ , with good comments , and since a slightly earlier version , sp70 , is described quite fully , with pseudocode , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 3.9 , 3.10 , and 9.2 ) . *",
    "_ high levels of parallel processing_. as far as possible , processes in the sp71 code will be modified to take advantage of parallel processing .",
    "this may be done in three main parts of the system , in procedures for : the matching and unification of patterns ( as outlined in appendix [ mup_appendix ] ) ; the building of multiple alignments ( appendix [ ma_appendix ] ) ; and the unsupervised learning of grammars ( appendix [ usl_grammars_appendix ] ) . *",
    "_ good user interface_. spf will be accessed via a well - designed website , with user - friendly interfaces for each part of the system , using multimedia where appropriate",
    ". it would be best if users did not have to download and install any software .",
    "any such downloading of software can probably be avoided by developing the user interface using the facilities of html5 . in accordance with google",
    "s new search policies , announced in april 2015 , . ]",
    "the website should be `` mobile friendly '' , meaning that it should be easy to use and legible on mobile phones . *",
    "_ setting up accounts_. there will be procedures for the registration of each user , assigning a unique identifier and setting up facilities for each account .",
    ", each user would be asked to ensure that , in all academic publications arising from research with spf , there would be an acknowledgement of the facility and of the body or bodies that have provided the necessary funds .",
    "] here , a `` user '' will be a research group or an individual researcher . to avoid undue complications , at least initially",
    ", each research group will be treated as if it was an individual researcher , with no attempt to differentiate individual researchers within each group , or their work .",
    "each research group would need to make its own arrangements for the division of labour within the group .",
    "+ it is likely that most of the necessary mechanisms are already established for registering users of the host machine . * _ creating new versions of the sp machine_. any user may create one or more new versions of spm : * * each such version will have its own storage space with documentation , source files , executable files , data files , and so on . *",
    "* there will an hierarchical scheme of the usual kind for the identifiers of different versions , with identifier(s ) for the creator(s ) of each version . *",
    "* the documentation should make clear the origins of each version in one or more previous versions , which may include spm1 or other versions by the same user or other users . *",
    "* any version of spm will be in one of two states : `` under development '' or `` completed '' .",
    "once a version has been `` completed '' , further modifications will not be allowed .",
    "the executable code of any completed version may be run by any other user ( next ) . * _ running the sp machine_. any version of spm that is under development may be run by the user that is developing it .",
    "any completed version of spm may be run by any user , which would of course include the user that created it . for any user to run any given version of spm",
    ", facilities will be needed for : * * assigning an area of storage to hold data and results . * * setting parameters for the given version of spm . * * creating and editing sp patterns . * * uploading sp patterns that have been created elsewhere . * * online debugging of software ( for spm versions that are under development ) .",
    "it is likely that a suitable debugger is already established on the host machine . * * viewing results , including multiple alignments and grammars created by the program . since some results  multiple alignments in particular  may be larger than can be seen comfortably on a typical computer screen , there should be facilities for zooming and scrolling . *",
    "* downloading sp patterns , included those newly - created by the given version of spm . *",
    "_ sp - neural , version 1_. alongside spm1 will be a first , tentative , version of the sp - neural machine , which may be referred to as `` spnrl1 '' .",
    "the main elements of the sp - neural facility will be : * * as with spm , each user may create one or more versions of spnrl . *",
    "* spnrl1 will have a means of translating a set of sp patterns ( or one or more multiple alignments ) into an inter - connected set of pattern assemblies . with the object - oriented facilities of c++",
    ", there will be a class for neurons and a class for pattern assemblies . * * in this preliminary model , each sp symbol will be represented by a single neuron although it is likely that in living brains , neural `` symbols '' are realised with clusters of inter - connected neurons . * * connections between neurons will be represented with c++ pointers .",
    "as spnrl is developed , it is likely that there will be excitatory connections and also inhibitory connections , in accordance with what is known about neural tissue .",
    "it is also likely that there will be lateral connections between neighbouring neurons within each pattern assembly .",
    "* * there will be a means of displaying , in graphical form , a set of inter - connected neurons and pattern assemblies , much as in figure [ connections_figure ] . * * for any given set of inter - connected neurons and pattern assemblies , there will be a means of downloading it as a set of sp patterns . * * as spnrl is developed : * * * there will be a means of sending excitatory and inhibitory signals through inter - connected pattern assemblies and displaying the results in terms of the excitatory levels of individual neurons .",
    "* * * there will a means of creating new pattern assemblies and learning neural ` grammars ' , in accordance with learning processes in any given version of spm . * * * parallel processing will be applied to mimic the high levels of parallelism that exist in the workings of real neural tissue .      for reasons that follow",
    ", spf should be permanent in the sense that it should be available for the foreseeable future :    * _ bridging the ` valley of death'_. in accordance with `` it is our historic failure to back [ r&d , technology and engineering ] which lies behind the familiar problems of the so - called ` valley of death ' between scientific discoveries and commercial applications , '' . ]",
    "the facility should support and encourage research that has sufficient breadth and depth to bridge that ` valley of death ' .",
    "short - termism is just as damaging for research as it is for business . *",
    "_ long - term research programmes _ : * * _ researchers need confidence that spf will not be withdrawn_. we envisage the proposed facility providing the basis for research that is likely to include long - term research programmes .",
    "any research group that wishes to embark on that kind of research programme needs to have confidence that the research facility will not be withdrawn . _ without assurance for researchers that the facility is permanent , it is likely that the entire project will fail_. * * _ bis : software as a sustained infrastructure in the long term_. `` current investments in software development should be reviewed with a view to developing models of support for software as a sustained infrastructure in the long term , as opposed to being supported by significant one off investments . '' . ] * * _ e - science institute : the need for long - term funding for ambitious software development projects_. `` there needs to be long - term funding for ambitious software development projects .... the current approach is hardware centric and short - term ... , but does not recognise the critical and long - term role that software and people play in the [ research computing ] enterprise . '' .",
    "] * _ time to develop research programmes_. it is likely to take time for a research group to learn about the sp system , to decide to mount a research project , to prepare a research proposal , for the proposal to be assessed , to provide pcs and other facilities , and to recruit staff .",
    "if the proposed research facility is only available for a few years ( bearing in mind the time needed to create the facility ) , much of that time may be taken up with the processes described .",
    "then it is likely that there would be little or no time left to do the actual research . * _ consistency across facilities_. in the same way that large and expensive facilities ",
    "large telescopes , atom smashers , supercomputers , and the like  are maintained for many years , and replaced as necessary , the same should apply to less expensive or smaller - scale facilities . in both cases , research benefits from the long - term perspective that stability makes possible . * _ archival status_. as outlined in section [ elements_of_spf_section ] , the facility will be designed so that research groups and individual researchers may create their own versions of the sp machine .",
    "each such version needs to have archival status : * * _ the need for long - term access to and execution of software_. other researchers , now and in the future , need to be able to access the source code and documentation for any version of the sp machine and to run the executable code . naturally , the host machine for spf may need to be replaced from time to time .",
    "in any such case , spf , including all associated projects and data , may be ported on to the replacement machine , in accordance with standard practice in industry and commerce . * * .",
    "the need for long - term preservation of software and associated computing systems is implied by:``software developed for experimental facilities and instrumentation , modelling and simulation and data - analysis is a critical and valuable resource .",
    "software and algorithm development represents major investments by skilled researchers , and the large suite of codes and algorithms used in research should be regarded as a vital research infrastructure , requiring support and maintenance along the innovation chain , and throughout its life cycle .",
    "the reproducibility of research is at the very heart of the scientific method . '' . ] .",
    "* * _ long - term preservation of software_. this requirement accords with the trend for academic journals to allow the author or authors of any published paper to provide supplementary material , which may include data , software , and things that may be regarded as forms of software , such as mp4 files . ) ; and _ ieee access",
    "_ allows authors to include `` data collections and multimedia materials '' ( `` ieee access ",
    "information for authors '' , pdf , http://bit.ly/1wd5h8x[bit.ly/1wd5h8x ] ) . ]",
    "it is increasingly recognised that many bodies of software should have the same archival status as peer - reviewed papers in academic journals or conference proceedings , and bodies of data on which those papers are based . * * _ preserving the execution environment_. since software will often not run , or will not run correctly , unless it is running on the type of computer ( with its operating system and related software ) for which it was written , there is also a need for long - term preservation of each type of computer .",
    "there is more detail here : * * * _ vint cerf : digital `` dark age '' and `` digital vellum''_. the case has been argued by internet pioneer vint cerf , as reported in , for example : `` google s vint cerf warns of ` digital dark age ' '' ] .",
    "vint cert also makes the case in a lecture that he gave on 2015 - 02 - 11 , `` digital vellum and the expansion of the internet into the solar system '' ( see http://bit.ly/1aqdekw[bit.ly/1aqdekw ] ) ; * * * .",
    "how software and associated computing systems may be preserved is demonstrated in the `` olive executable archive '' , https://olivearchive.org/[www.olivearchive.org ] .",
    "this project has been highlighted by vint cerf in his articles and lectures .",
    "* * * _ new gold standard established for open and reproducible research_. the case has also been argued by computer scientists at cambridge university who `` have set a new gold standard for openness and reproducibility in research by sharing the more than 200 gb of data and 20,000 lines of code behind their latest results  an unprecedented degree of openness in a peer - reviewed publication . '' . ] * * * _ maintaining access to digitised information_. the need to maintain access to digitised information in the face of changes in the hardware or software environment that it needs is discussed in `` preserving the digital record of computing history . ''",
    "+ as noted above , replacement of spf s host machine should not be a problem .",
    "the system may be ported onto any new machine , as or when that becomes necessary . * _ avoiding waste and gaining full value from spf_. given that the bulk of the cost of spf is in its initial development and setting up , there is little scope for saving money by terminating the facility within a few years .",
    "indeed , any such move is likely to mean a waste of resources and a failure to gain full value from the facility : * * _ the damaging effect of short - termism_. as noted above , it is likely that the entire project will fail unless researchers have confidence that the facility is permanent . * * _ loss of valuable research_. premature termination of spf would mean losses of valuable research that may otherwise accrue , much of it provided at no cost to the uk by researchers elsewhere ( sections [ impact_section ] and [ easy_to_access_and_to_use_section ] ) . * * _ spf will not wear out and its value will increase_. unlike ordinary research facilities such as space telescopes or atom smashers , spf will not wear out . and its value for researchers will increase progressively as new versions of spm are created and made available for the whole research community , including all new insights and improvements .",
    "as previously noted , the wide scope of the sp system means that there are far more avenues to be explored than any one research group could tackle on its own .",
    "accordingly , we are are aiming to create a facility for research groups and individual researchers anywhere in the world .",
    "it should not be restricted to uk scientists :    * this accords with what john kelly and steve hamm say about the need for large - scale collaboration ( quoted in section [ theory_and_machine_section ] ) and also with the need for integration of e - infrastructures `` internationally , across other national e - infrastructures , to deliver end - to - end services in the global environment of collaborative research '' . ] and the need to facilitate `` ... research collaboration between industry and academia . ''",
    "* it also accords with the principles that : * * the epsrc aims to `` understand the whole uk e - infrastructure landscape , view it holistically and _ consider it within an international context _ ( emphasis added ) . '' . ] * * `` the uk s research and innovation e - infrastructure needs to be led and driven to deliver a uk wide vision for research e - infrastructure , _ embedded in the international context essential to today s research challenges_. '' ( emphasis added ) .. ] * opening up the research in this way is likely to yield synergies that might not arise if there were more restrictions ( section [ uk_industrial_strategy_section])with corresponding benefits for uk researchers . *",
    "the international perspective will help to achieve full value from the facility ( section [ broad_scope_section ] ) . * and it will help to increase the impact of the facility ( section [ impact_section ] ) and its international influence ( section [ international_influence_section ] ) .      in keeping with the main points in the preceding subsection ,",
    "it is important to minimise obstacles to the use of the system for preliminary investigations , for teaching students , for individual research projects , and for long - term research programmes .",
    "an additional reason is that , for any research group or individual researcher that is not already familiar with the sp concepts , a significant amount of time and effort is likely to be required to get up to speed , so it is important to minimise other obstacles to progress .    for these reasons",
    ":    * _ ease of access_. the process of registering with the system and gaining access to it should be as simple and straightforward as possible . * _ user friendly_. for all aspects and parts of the system , there should be a user - friendly interface . * _ free at the point of use_. with few if any exceptions , the system should be free for users .",
    "in addition to minimising obstacles for researchers , reasons include : * * _ research dividends_. in keeping with remarks about research ` dividend ' in section [ impact_section ] , the overall value of research done with spf is likely to outweigh the cost of providing and maintaining the facility , and by a considerable margin .",
    "* * _ research bonuses_. as noted in section [ impact_section ] , research that is done by research groups and individual researchers outside the uk may be seen as a bonus , additional to what would be achieved if the facility were restricted to uk researchers . *",
    "* _ research synergies_. also , as noted in section [ uk_industrial_strategy_section ] , there are likely to be benefits from synergies and large - scale collaboration . * * the ` valley of death ' . in accordance with remarks in section [ spf_permanent_section ] about the ` valley of death ' , it is important to avoid any premature requirement that the research should , commercially , `` stand on its own two feet '' or `` become self - sustaining '' , in much the same way that we do not expect young children to go out and earn a living .    with regard to costs ,",
    "these may be met as follows :    * _ development and maintenance costs_. these costs may be met from a variety of sources , perhaps including funds for the support of researchers based in the uk . * _ running costs_. although it is likely that mature versions of spm will be used for computationally - demanding tasks , we believe that much research with spf can be done with small examples that make small computational demands on the host computer , and that the associated costs would be relatively small .",
    "it seems likely that the cost of administering a system of charges for running costs would outweigh the actual costs . in that case",
    ", it would be best , probably , not to attempt to make any charges for the use of the system .",
    "a possible exception is where a user wishes to run the system with computational tasks that are likely to consume large computational resources .",
    "as already mentioned , spm should be open source .",
    "more specifically , it should be possible for anyone  including people who are not registered users of spf  to view the source code and documentation of any completed version of spm , and for any registered user to run any completed version .    in keeping with these points , all versions of spm",
    "should be `` free software '' conforming to the gnu general public license , described on http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html ] . in brief",
    ", this means that every user should have :    * the freedom to use the software for any purpose ; * the freedom to change the software to suit his or her needs ; * the freedom to share the software with friends and neighbours ; and * the freedom to share the changes that any user makes .",
    "this policy conforms to and supports the long - established principle that science works best when ideas , observations and experimental results are freely available to everyone , without restrictions .",
    "this kind of openness and transparency is essential if we are to make the difficult transition to cognitive computing ( section [ challenges_section ] ) .",
    "costs associated with spf are estimated in the following subsections . a spreadsheet that summarises all the estimated costs , with totals ,",
    "is shown in section [ summary_of_costs_section ] .",
    "we estimate that three members of staff with the right skills who are already familiar with the host machine would be able to develop spf within 2 years .",
    "we suggest that it would be appropriate to employ one relatively senior person , perhaps at a salary of about @xmath3 , one more junior person , perhaps at a salary of about @xmath4 , and a third person , possibly a student , at a salary of about @xmath5 .",
    "we have assumed that the cost of employing someone is twice the cost of his or her salary , and of course salaries would be paid for two years .",
    "we have allowed @xmath6 for pcs , printers , software , and related facilities for the three staff .    in view of the importance of the website for spf and the specialised skills required for good website design  including the skills needed to ensure that the website is `` mobile friendly''we believe it would be prudent to employ a web design company to establish the framework for the website and advise on how it should be developed .",
    "we estimate that @xmath7 should be allowed for this work .",
    "we have allowed 10% for contingencies .",
    "the annual cost of running spf are estimated in the following subsections and summarised in section [ summary_of_costs_section ] .",
    "we believe that when spf is up and running , it will need support : to make sure that it runs smoothly and to deal with any snags that arise ; to answer queries by users ; to fix bugs in the system ; and to refine the system in the light of feedback from users .",
    "we believe that these things can be done by one person with a salary of about @xmath4 pa , with an assistant at about @xmath5 pa .",
    "as mentioned in section [ easy_to_access_and_to_use_section ] , we believe that much of the research with spf would make small demands on the host computer and , probably , that the associated costs would be smaller than the cost of administering a system of charges . nevertheless , such costs do need to be covered .",
    "we estimate that they would be @xmath8 pa .      in accordance with `` impact '' policies of the uk government and uk research councils ( section [ impact_section ] ) ,",
    "it is important that spf and what it can do should be well known around the world , amongst academic and industrial researchers , amongst research administrators and policy - makers , and amongst members of the general public .",
    "this may be achieved via the following main routes , each one with associated costs :    * via papers in academic journals and conference proceedings .",
    "most of these would be prepared by research groups and individual researchers that are using spf , and they would pay the associated costs .",
    "but , in addition , there would be academic papers about spf and spm , prepared by the two authors of this proposal and staff recruited to develop spf",
    ". the main costs here would be the costs of attending conferences and charges for open - access publication .",
    "* the proposers , and perhaps development staff as well , may travel to give talks about spf and the sp concepts . * perhaps via conferences ( online or traditional ) dedicated to research using spf .",
    "the organisation may be undertaken by a specialist conference organiser , and there would be associated costs .",
    "* via articles in popular - science magazines , both those for the general reader and those with a more technical or specialist orientation . here , it would be useful if articles could be prepared by writers with relevant skills ( who would need to be paid ) , although technical input would be provided by the authors of this proposal and research / development staff .",
    "articles may be translated from english into other languages .",
    "* via the mainstream media ( newspapers , radio and tv ) , internet blogs , and online videos .",
    "again , it would be useful if articles , videos and the like could be prepared by people with relevant skills , with guidance from people with relevant technical knowledge .",
    "we estimate that a budget of @xmath9 pa would be needed to cover these costs during the two - year development phase , reducing to @xmath10 pa for a further three years .",
    "although we believe it is important that spf should be a permanent facility , as described in section [ spf_permanent_section ] , we shall assume for present purposes that awareness - raising costs will be spread over a period of 20 years .",
    "in that case , the annual cost will be @xmath11 .",
    "as with the non - recurrent development costs , we have allowed 10% for contingencies .      in this section ,",
    "table [ spreadsheet_table ] summarises our estimates of non - recurrent costs for spf ( @xmath12 in total ) and recurrent costs ( @xmath13 pa in total ) .",
