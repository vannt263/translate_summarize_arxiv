    "it should be emphasized that it is crucial to assume that the sctf indeed reproduces discrete energy levels ( ` convergence ' in the sense of distributions ) , else the argument for the existence of ` classical correlations ' loses its validity .",
    "thus , there is an inherent connection between the quest for classical correlations , and the wonder concerning to the mathematical soundness ( ` convergence ' ) of the sctf .",

    "at a later stage we shall discuss the modifications that are required in the application to complex ( e.g. diffusive ) systems .",
    "the formulation of quantal - classical duality and the associated heuristic understanding of classical correlations thus paves the way towards a global semiclassical theory of spectral statistics that goes beyond the diagonal approximation .",
    "we use from now on the term ` classical correlations ' or ` classical po - correlations ' rather than the term ` action correlations ' .",
    "sometimes , the latter term is misleading .",
    "some of the results were already reported by d. cohen @xcite .",
    "they are discussed and further developed in the present paper .",
    "some remarks on the method of presentation are in order .",
    "most of the discussion will be carried out for billiard systems .",
    "billiards are particularly convenient since they are scaling systems . because of this property",
    ", the sctf can be simplified by considering the quantum wavenumbers instead of the energies , and in the classical description the length of the po replaces the action and the time , ( since one can always choose @xmath45 ) .",

    "the role of non - universal features is discussed as well .    in * section iii",
    "* we give an interpretation of the classical correlation scale , and introduce a statistical model for rigidity in terms of ` families ' .",
    "then we use various arguments and the notions of ` classification ' and ` similarity ' in order to reveal the actual structure of the classical spectrum .",
    "finally we make some observations concerning the origin of classical correlations .",
    "some of our observations concerning classical correlations are further supported by the numerical study of * section vi*. there we have carried out a detailed analysis of the quantum and classical spectra of the sinai billiard in 3d , for which we possess substantial and immaculate data bases @xcite .",
    "this analysis provides for the first time a clue to the basic problem  the derivation of the classical po - correlations based on a purely classical argument rather than on the semiclassical duality .",
    "* section iv * extends the formulation of section ii to the general case of either chaotic or integrable hamiltonian systems . for generic integrable system",
    "we discuss the dual poissonian nature of both the quantal and the classical spectra .",
    "( see also @xcite ) . the general strategy is further illustrated by referring to specific examples , namely , the riemann zeros and the 3d torus .",
    "3d torus is particularly interesting due to its non - genericity and is analyzed in detailed .    besides the mathematically oriented questions that concern the _ existence _ of classical correlations",
    ", there is also the practical hope to extend the semiclassical theory beyond the diagonal approximation .",
    "classical po - correlations become most significant in the analysis of _ complex systems _ since they lead to relatively short breaktime scales that are not related to the universal heisenberg time . in * section v * we make use of the physical insight gained in the discussion of classical po - correlations in order to formulate the modifications that are required in order to go beyond the diagonal approximation . a specific example is the quasi-1d classically - diffusive chain .",
    "the quantal form factor should correspond either to anderson - localized eigenstates or to band structure , depending on whether the chain is disordered or periodic .",
    "these genuine quantal effects are due to interference , hence the non - diagonal terms play a crucial role .",
    "one may question the feasibility of having po - theory for the spectral properties in such circumstances .",
    "thus , our interest in complex systems is twofold . on the one hand",
    "we develop a semiclassical theory which is not limited by the diagonal approximation . on the other hand we test the limits of the semiclassical approach .",
    "we use our present level of understanding of the sctf and of classical po - correlations in order to demonstrate that the sctf should be effective also in the study of complex systems .",
    "the emergence of a non - universal volume - independent breaktime in case of a disordered systems is an obvious consequence of the formulation .",
    "the semiclassical trace formula ( sctf ) relates the quantal spectrum of energy levels to the classical spectrum of periodic orbits ( pos ) . as explained in the introduction",
    "the sctf can be utilized in order to derive a semiclassical expression for the quantal form factor .",
    "the purpose of this section , following @xcite , is to introduce an explicit formulation of the _ quantal - classical duality _ concept .",

    "actually , we believe that a more complicated picture of _ hierarchical structure _ is appropriate ( subsection e ) . the last subsection clarifies the rle of resurgence in the theory of classical correlations .",
    "when considering pos of length @xmath256 , one may _ define _ the _ geometrical scale _",
    "@xmath168 as the average distance between points where a typical po of length @xmath67 intersects a given surface of section .",

    "thus we obtain some heuristic understanding for the origin of classical correlations .",
    "we also try to speculate a formal approach for a future derivation of classical correlations .",
    "we suggest that an appropriate coarse - graining procedure may be used in order to approximate any generic billiard by a `` graph '' .",
    "this way metric correlations are transformed into a comparatively simple degeneracy structure .      in order to gain some insight into the classical correlations ,",
    "let us ignore the fluctuations of the instability amplitudes , and let us further assume that correlations between pos that correspond to different maslov index are not important .",
    "these assumptions reflect our belief that the statistical correlations of the _ weighted _ classical spectrum are actually present also in the _ bare _ spectrum of lengths .",
    "to support this point of view one should notice that our result ( [ e_lambda ] ) for the classical correlation length @xmath168 possess a very simple geometric interpretation : it is the average distance between neighboring points where a po of length @xmath67 bounced from the @xmath257 dimensional billiard surface .    using loose notations , the two point statistics of the classical _ bare _ spectrum is @xmath258 where the angle brackets denote averaging over reference pos whose length is @xmath259 , and @xmath260 refers to the smoothed density .",

    "if each family is characterized by the same two - point correlation function @xmath101 , then also their union will have the same @xmath101 .",
    "the latter interpretation makes it clear that the spectrum will look like poisson on scales which are smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to notice that the total density of pos grows exponentially with @xmath67 due to their proliferation .",
    "still , the average density of those pos that actually contribute to @xmath101 is @xmath265 .",
    "it implies that the overwhelming majority of periodic orbits @xmath266 is uncorrelated with the reference po .",
    "the rigidity of the spectrum manifests itself only on scales which are larger than @xmath46 .",
    "this interpretation of classical correlations settles the apparent contradiction between the observation of poisson statistics on small scales @xcite and the existence of non - trivial two - point statistics on the other hand . at this stage",
    "it is useful to draw an _ analogy _ with the statistical properties of a quantal spectrum that corresponds to a system with localization .",
    "the spectrum looks like poisson on small energy scales , since neighboring levels correspond to well separated eigenstates .",
    "however , on large energy scales the rigidity of the spectrum is manifest .",
    "this rigidity reflects the fact that the spectrum constitutes a union of many local sub - spectra .",
    "eigenstates that dwell in the same localization - volume constitute a family .      in an attempt to understand the dynamical origins of the po - correlations , it is useful to classify the pos according to some dynamical criteria , and to study the statistical properties of pos which share some common feature .",
    "one can consider for example a class of pos having the same number of bounces on the boundaries .",
    "a more refined classification can be obtained when symbolic codes are available . in this case",
    "one can classify the pos according to certain requirements on the codes .",
    "the most simple classification is obtained by gathering all the pos which are conjugate to each other by a symmetry operation such as time reversal or reflection .",
    "such classifications may reflect certain statistical features of the classical spectrum .",
    "the classical spectrum is rigid since @xmath101 has a finite range @xmath46 , and it satisfies the normalization @xmath267 .",
    "if the classification is arbitrary , then one will find that pos of a given class constitute a non - rigid spectrum . from now on we",
    "shall use the notion of ` class ' and ` classification ' in a more restricted fashion .",
    "_ by definition , pos of a class should constitute a rigid spectrum by themselves_. a classification of pos into ( mutually - exclusive ) classes is an important tool for revealing the statistical properties of the classical spectrum .",
    "a classification is particularly useful if there are no cross correlations between different class - spectra . in some cases",
    "we can argue an a - priori existence of a classification scheme . at some other cases , as in section [ sec : numerics ] ,",

    "the most obvious example for useful classification of pos occurs while analyzing a disordered chain of cells .",
    "such a complex billiard constitutes a quasi one dimensional diffusive system .",
    "pos whose period @xmath25 is less than the ergodic time may be classified by the volume which they explore .",
    "pos that belong to different volumes can not be correlated , since if the shape of one of the cells is modified , it will affect only those pos that explore it .",
    "if the statistical model of subsection a were realized in actual dynamical systems , then the finest classification of pos would be into families .",
    "further classification would not be possible .",
    "a direct understanding of classical correlations implies in some cases that a classification of pos into families has been indeed identified .",
    "an analytical theory requires further derivation of the two points statistics that characterizes these families , including the study of cross - correlations between families .",
    "it should be emphasized that different classifications may be found appropriate while analyzing non - universal rather than universal correlations .    assuming that cross - correlations between classes are negligible",
    ", it follows that the form factor can be decomposed in the following way @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the diagonal sum that corresponds to pos of the @xmath270-class , while @xmath271 are the corresponding correlation factors .",

    "if a the statistical model of subsection a were indeed realized in actual dynamical systems , then we would expect that pos of the same family would be geometrically related in some intimate way . in the present section",
    "we wish to use a variant of the quantal - duality argument in order to develop a notion of similarity .",
    "we do it by extending an idea due to fishman and keating @xcite .",
    "consider a simple ballistic planar billiard . a magnetic flux line @xmath272 penetrates the plane at a point @xmath273 which is located inside the billiard .",
    "the form factor @xmath107 with @xmath274 will correspond to gue statistics .",
    "now , assume that additional flux lines @xmath275 penetrate the plane at the points @xmath276 .",
    "the form factor @xmath277 still corresponds to gue statistics , as well as its average @xmath278 , where the average is over @xmath275 .",
    "however , it is a straightforward exercise to prove that the semiclassical expression for the averaged form factor is given by ( [ e_kalpha ] ) , where @xmath270 denotes a class of pos that share the _ same _ set of winding numbers @xmath279 with respect to the flux lines .",
    "assuming that all the classes are characterized by the same statistics , it follows that all the @xmath271 are identical with the gue correlation factor ( [ e2_27 ] ) .",
    "thus , each of the classes constitute a rigid spectrum by itself .",
    "one may add more and more flux lines , thus achieving finer and finer classification of pos .",
    "let us denote the typical distance between flux lines by @xmath280 .",
    "semiclassical considerations are valid as long as @xmath281 , where @xmath135 is the de - broglie wavelength .",
    "manifestation of rigidity is expected only in the quantal ( q ) regime where @xmath282 .",
    "it follows that the semiclassical argumentation for rigidity of the @xmath270 classes is restricted by the @xmath87-independent condition @xmath283 .",
    "thus we deduce that @xmath284 , ( which is essentially the mean distance between chords of a typical po whose length is l ) , actually determines the similarity - resolution .",
    "it is plausible that in some sense , by using @xmath280 of order @xmath168 , one will obtain the desired classification of pos into families .",
    "literally , one may object this point of view using the argument that the locations @xmath285 are arbitrary , therefore the classification into families is ill - defined .",
    "this objection can be dismissed by noting the analogy with localization theory ( see end of subsection a ) .",
    "there , eigenstates may be classified by partitioning the physical space into ` blocks ' .",
    "the partitioning into blocks is arbitrary .",
    "the limit of fine partitioning into small blocks , whose linear dimension is of the order of localization length , is problematic .",

    "the difference @xmath290 is of the order @xmath200 , and one expects to have gone via an avoided crossing .",
    "thus we deduce that the _ correlation scale _",
    "@xmath200 can be identified with the _ variation scale _ @xmath52 .",
    "the latter can be computed by extrapolating the leading order perturbative calculation up to the point where we expect that it will loose its validity .",
    "now we wish to speculate an analogous property for the classical spectrum .",

    "the conjecture is that the _ correlation scale _",
    "@xmath168 should be identified with the _ variation scale _ @xmath64 . by definition , in order to determine the variation scale @xmath64 we should consider some parametric deformation of the billiard . rather than having ` avoided crossings ' we shall have ` avoided bifurcations ' .",
    "the variation scale is calculated by applying linear analysis up to point where it is expected to loose its validity . rather than considering a general deformation",
    "it is most convenient to analyze a specific deformation that takes us right to the bifurcation .",
    "note the analogy between ` bifurcations ' and ` crossings ' .",
    "we consider a local deformation of the boundary .",
    "the normal distance of this deformation is @xmath286 , and it involves a small surface area .",
    "we further assume that the linear dimension of the deformed surface is of the order @xmath284 . at this stage @xmath284",
    "is _ defined _ as the average distance between points where a typical po of length @xmath67 hits the surface .",
    "it follows that each po of length @xmath67 hits the deformed surface only once ( on the average ) .",
    "if the deformation is small , meaning no bifurcation , then a po keeps its identity , but its length is changed by @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the incidence angle ( see appendix a for proof ) .",
    "the po will disappear if @xmath286 becomes of the order @xmath284 .",
    "the deformed surface hits then one of the segments of the po .",
    "thus we conclude that the _ variation scale _ is @xmath284 .",
    "it follows from our conjecture that this variation scale will show up in the two point statistics .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the significance of bifurcations from the quantal - classical duality point of view . here",
    "we present a consistency argument that further substantiate the identification of the classical correlation scale @xmath46 with the geometrical scale @xmath168 .",
    "considering the specific deformation of the previous paragraph , it is expected that the @xmath293 are uncorrelated .",
    "the distribution of @xmath294 will be denoted by @xmath295 .",
    "the average @xmath296 is zero , and the standard - deviation is of order @xmath286 . in appendix",
    "a we prove that if a classical spectrum is modified as in the present case , namely @xmath297 , then the new correlation factor is @xmath298 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath299 is the fourier transform of @xmath295 .",
    "however , assuming that no symmetry breaking is involved , the new correlation factor should correspond to the same universal statistics as the old one .",
    "this will be true if either @xmath300 and/or @xmath301 .",
    "the function @xmath302 has a crossover at @xmath303 , while the function @xmath304 has a crossover at @xmath305 , where @xmath46 is the classical correlation scale ( yet to be determined ) .",
    "hence we obtain the @xmath87-independent condition @xmath306 .",
    "if the latter condition is not satisfied then our considerations will lead to inconsistency . on the other hand",
    "the only essential assumption for our considerations to hold is having no bifurcations .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that the condition @xmath306 actually coincides with the condition @xmath307 leading to the identification of the universal correlation scale @xmath46 with the geometrical scale @xmath168 .",
    "quantized graphs ( networks ) @xcite display spectral statistics which are reproduced to a high level of accuracy by the predictions of rmt @xcite . at the same time , the spectral density can be expressed in terms of an exact trace formula which involves summation over pos ( loops ) . with an appropriate definition for the instability amplitudes ,",
    "this trace formula looks formally the same as the sctf of section ii .",
    "still , the graphs are sufficiently simple to enable a clear understanding of the origins of po - correlations as well as their implications on the quantal spectrum @xcite .",
    "a graph is a strictly one dimensional system .",
    "it is composed of a finite number of bonds ( wires ) which are connected at junctions ( vertices ) .",
    "classical dynamics is mixing because at each junction a particle takes a markovian choice of the next bond on which it moves .",
    "the multiple connectivity of the graph induces the mixing nature of the system .",
    "the graph dynamics is bernoulli , and as such it is characterized by an exponential proliferation of pos , to which positive lyapunov coefficients can be assigned according to the probability to remain on the graph .",
    "the smooth part of the quantal spectral density is given by weyl s law for a @xmath308 system .",
    "thus the heisenberg time is @xmath309 , where @xmath310 are the lengths of the bonds ( assumed to be non - commensurate to avoid non generic degeneracies ) .",
    "the oscillatory part of the spectral density is a sum of contributions from pos .",
    "each contribution is a complex number whose amplitude is the square root of the classical probability to remain on the graph , and its phase is the action @xmath311 where @xmath60 is the orbit length .",
    "a topological phase factor @xmath312 plays a similar role to the maslov index .",
    "@xmath313 counts the number of time the orbit back - scatters from a vertex .",
    "( that is , the number of sequences of the type `` @xmath314 '' which appear in the code of the po ) .",
    "the classical length spectrum for the graph has a simple structure - it is obtained by taking the linear combinations @xmath315 , which are consistent with the connectivity of the graph , and @xmath316 are natural numbers .",
    "this structure of the length spectrum is revealed only if @xmath317 because for such lengths the orbit must be reducible to combinations of lengths of shorter orbits .",
    "we see again that the heisenberg length @xmath318 plays a natural role in the discussion of the morphology of the po - spectrum .",
    "this is in complete accordance with the previous discussion of the duality concept .",
    "the fact that the heisenberg length is constant ( @xmath87-independent ) implies that one can generate the spectral two point function using an arbitrarily large spectral interval ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this way , one can reach the domain where the function @xmath131 is composed of arbitrarily sharp spikes which resolve completely the length spectrum for lengths which are both smaller and larger than @xmath318 .",
    "the smoothed @xmath131 was compared with the predictions of rmt and was found to be in excellent agreement @xcite .",
    "the only correlations of pos which survive this treatments are correlations between orbits which have the _ same lengths_. one may consider this to be a complicated ( generalized ) case of degeneracy .",
    "note that the instability amplitudes that correspond to degenerated pos should not have the same phase . for @xmath319",
    "there are hardly any length degeneracies , and therefore @xmath320 for @xmath321 . for @xmath322",
    "the degeneracies of lengths increase rapidly with @xmath67 , and the correlations between the pos which bring about the correct @xmath67 dependence of the form factor are the correlations between the back - scatter indices @xmath313 .",
    "this result demonstrates one important features of the pos correlations , namely , that pos carry both _",
    "metric _ information ( action integrals or just lengths ) and _ topological _ information ( maslov indices and degeneracies ) .",
    "the correlations which are responsible to the quantum - classical duality sometimes reside in the metric information exclusively ( sinai billiards ) and sometimes in the topological information as was discussed above for quantum graphs .",
    "one of the most important recent developments in our understanding of the connection between classical chaos and quantum statistics was recently put forward by bogomolny and keating ( bk ) @xcite .",
    "they showed how to derive the non diagonal part of the quantal form factor by using information about short pos with @xmath323 exclusively , and moreover , they assumed that these short orbits are statistically independent .",
    "we would like to discuss now the bk construction and show how it is related to the correlations which are discussed here .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath324 provides a reasonable first approximation to the counting function , and it is improved by identifying the points @xmath327 where @xmath324 assumes the values @xmath328 for all integers @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting spectral density is @xmath329 the main purpose of this construction is to ensure the @xmath42 function structure of the spectral density .",
    "this is done , however , at the cost of producing a spectral density which might differ from the real one in detail .",

    "even the topological entropy of the synthetic pos is not that of the original system .",
    "bk used their procedure to obtain averaged spectral correlations which might be less sensitive to the problems inherent to the method .    using the intuition we derive from the work on quantized graphs",

    "it is plausible that this coarse graining scale is appropriate in order to obtain a faithful approximation for the classical sum .",
    "however , we do not have a purely classical argumentation for this speculation .",
    "if this speculation is true , then we may approximate the length of long pos by a sum of the form @xmath335 , where @xmath336 is a set of comparatively _ short pos that form a skeleton structure_. the idea that long pos are supported by short pos is called ` shadowing ' @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the sum @xmath337 for the skeleton which is required for a _ faithful _ representation of _ all _ the long pos of the coarse - grained phase space .",

    "the billiard is now approximated by a `` graph '' .",
    "the heisenberg time for this graph is @xmath340 , which is the generic quantal result .    using the shadowing concept",
    "we can therefore obtain a heuristic understanding for the origin of classical correlations . by improving gradually the coarse - graining resolution of phase space",
    ", the hierarchical structure of the classical spectrum is revealed .",
    "pos that are identical in length on a given resolution scale , will become a rigid family if the classical spectrum is probed with better resolution .",
    "it turns out that the statistics of composite periodic orbits ( cpos ) is simpler that the statistics of primitive periodic orbits ( ppo ) @xcite . the cpo - spectrum @xmath341 is obtained from the ppo spectrum , where the @xmath342 are integer repetitions .",
    "there is a strong analogy ppo @xmath343 primes , and cpo @xmath343 natural - numbers ( see section iv - f ) .",
    "actually , it turns out that the two point statistical correlations of cpos is essentially the same as that of the natural numbers , meaning that the scaling function is universal and @xmath44-independent .",

    "the latter auto - correlation function is essentially _ real _ and therefore the corresponding form factor @xmath349 is symmetric , namely satisfies the functional relation @xmath350 the quantal form factor @xmath349 is related to the two points statistics @xmath351 of the cpo spectrum . therefore ( [ e_funcrel ] ) can be re - interpreted as a _ classical _ relation between the statistics of long pos and the statistics of short pos .",
    "the existence of such relation is hardly surprising , it should follow from the observation that long pos are supported by shorts ones . a classical derivation of ( [ e_funcrel ] ) would be a major step in the understanding of classical correlations . in @xcite",
    "the functional relation has been re - expressed in terms of ppo - statistics , leading to the well known relation @xcite between the diagonal behavior of @xmath30 for short times , and its ` off - diagonal ' behavior in the vicinity of heisenberg time .",

    "the dependence of the actions @xmath361 on the energy @xmath1 is not emphasized in the above formula since the value of @xmath1 is fixed to some constant value . with this notations",
    "the formulation of the relation between the quantal @xmath270-spectrum and the classical @xmath235-spectrum is exactly as for billiards , the only difference being that now also the quantal spectrum is weighted .",
    "if one insist to fix @xmath270 and to consider the statistical properties of the @xmath1-spectrum , then a different strategy is required .",
    "picking an energy @xmath362 , one should assume that it belongs to an energy interval @xmath363 $ ] where the pos are structurally stable ( see remark @xcite ) , meaning that there are no bifurcations of pos while @xmath1 is varied .",
    "thus @xmath364 is a well defined function in this range .",
    "the time periods are @xmath365 .",
    "the general statistical theory of section ii applies with small modifications .",
    "it is also essential to make the approximation @xmath366 , and to define a scaled energy variable @xmath367 .",
    "note that @xmath368 is classically a very small energy interval , while @xmath369 is semiclassically very large .",

    "this two point correlation function does not correspond to any one - point density unless there is a scaling relation such that @xmath376 .",
    "actually it is sufficient to assume a strong statistical correlation within families , rather than an exact global scaling relation .",
    "there is a better formulation of the general quantal - classical duality , which enables to treat _ on equal footing _ both the classical and the quantal spectra , as in the special case of billiard systems .",

    "tori that correspond to the same frequency ratio @xmath420 are located along a ray .",
    "the intersection of the ray with the energy surface determines the period @xmath25 , and the corresponding torus is such that @xmath416 .",

    "therefore the same considerations that lead to the deduction of poisson statistics apply also in this case .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the 3-dimensional torus billiard .",
    "it will serve as an interesting illustration of the duality relations presented in the previous subsection .",
    "we discuss first the general 3d torus with unequal edges @xmath422 .",
    "the quantal spectral density is given explicitly as : @xmath423 the classical density is : @xmath424 the berry - tabor semiclassical trace formula for the quantal density of states is obtained by performing poisson summation of @xmath425 which can be carried out exactly : @xmath426 in order to cast ( [ e_brtb ] ) into the explicitly dual form @xmath427 one should define @xmath428_{osc } \\ ; ,   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\rho_{cl}(l ) \\equiv \\frac{i v}{2 \\pi",

    "the argument at the end of the last subsection further suggests that this statistics is poissonian .",
    "moreover , both the classical and the quantal asymptotes ( diagonal approximations ) of the form factor have the same value : @xmath429 which is indeed independent of both @xmath87 and @xmath67 , confirming ( [ eq : kqint ] , [ eq : kdint ] ) .",
    "all these arguments strongly suggest that the form factor is a constant for all @xmath430 : @xmath431 we note that the conventional form factor which is calculated from @xmath425 rather than from @xmath432 is @xmath433 and is not purely classical for small @xmath67 values ( classical diagonal regime ) .",
    "we now turn to the special and interesting case of the cubic 3-torus : @xmath434 . in this case , both the quantum and the classical spectra are directly proportional to the vectors of the cubic lattice @xmath435 . the vectors @xmath436 exhibit a geometrical degeneracy of their lengths @xmath437 due to permutations of the indices and/or sign changes .",
    "much more interesting is the number - theoretical degeneracy of @xmath438 , for example @xmath439 . denoting by @xmath440 the overall degeneracy of @xmath238 : @xmath441 applying this result to the classical and quantal diagonal approximations give : @xmath442 these asymptotes are in sharp contrast with the poisson ( generic integrable ) case and are actually reminiscent of rmt predictions ( generic chaotic ) in 2 dimensions !",
    "this unexpected behavior of `` chaotic '' form factor for an integrable system is due to the number - theoretical peculiarities of the cubic 3-torus .",
    "this is an interesting example , when the classical - quantal duality is explicit , and yet a statistics which is more interesting then poisson is obtained .",

    "the pos may be classified by the volume which is explored .",
    "we denote by @xmath597 the partial diagonal sum that corresponds to pos that explore @xmath20 specified cells . looking on pos of length @xmath25 , the probability for finding a po that explores @xmath20 cells should be proportional to @xmath597 .",

    "the generalization of these ideas to localization in higher dimensions is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the blc conjecture is sufficient in order to determine the non - universal breaktime @xmath161 and the corresponding localization length .",
    "qualitative agreement with scaling theory of localization in one to three dimensions can be demonstrated . in particular , the present theory is capable of giving a qualitative semiclassical understanding for the existence of a critical regime in three dimensional systems . on the other hand",
    ", the quantitative analysis is unsatisfactory .",
    "the blc working hypothesis overestimates the effect of ( negative ) correlations .",
    "we believe that the statistics is modified due to leaking of pos , thus leaving holes in the classical spectrum . as a result",
    "there is some effective clustering that affects the functional form of the correlations .",

    "it is interesting to discuss the implications of translational invariance . rather than having spectral statistics that correspond to localization",

    "the relevant classification of pos is still by the explored volume .",
    "pos that explore the whole volume ( @xmath614 ) constitute a negligible minority since we assume an effectively infinite chain for which @xmath595 .",
    "still , in the case of a periodic chain one may further classify the pos in the class @xmath614 by their self - symmetry .",
    "specifically , there are pos that are invariant to translations of @xmath615 cells",
    ". it should be emphasize that as far as the _ unfolded chain _ is concerned these self - symmetric pos constitute a minority within a minority . on the other hand ,",
    "once the classical spectrum of the _ folded chain _ is considered , the primitive versions of these self - symmetric pos become dominant in the classical spectrum . the class index @xmath395 in the latter case should be interpreted as the winding number . the distribution of the folded pos with respect to @xmath395 is a gaussian @xcite . let us denote by @xmath616 the diagonal sum that corresponds to the class of pos whose winding number is @xmath395 . summing over @xmath395",

    "the distribution is peaked at @xmath620 , still the @xmath620 pos become a minority with respect to @xmath621 if @xmath622 .    from the above discussion",
    "it should be clear that the relevant classification of pos is totally different for the folded chain when compared to the unfolded chain .",
    "if one wishes to study the statistical properties of the band spectrum , one should consider an unfolded chain , and the corresponding classification is the same as for the disordered chain . _",
    "the pos that determine the statistical properties of the spectrum for a given quasi - momentum , will not be involved in the semiclassical analysis of the band spectrum ! _",
    "thus , the only difference between disordered and periodic chain is associated with the two - point statistics of the classical spectrum . for a disordered chain",
    "the correlation scale is class - dependent , namely @xmath623 , while for a periodic chain @xmath624 for all the classes .",
    "using the blc approximation scheme , taking into account symmetry , one obtains the result @xmath625 the above analysis essentially coincides with that of @xcite for @xmath626 , where @xmath610 is the one - cell heisenberg time .",

    "for @xmath629 we have obtained @xmath630 , which does not agree with the correct @xmath631 behavior .",
    "thus , in order to have a proper semiclassical theory for band spectrum we should know the way in which the scaling function is modified .",
    "again , we conclude that the blc conjecture is effective in the determination of the various time scales involved , whereas the blc working hypothesis is unsatisfactory .",
    "in this section we use our numerical database to study _ classical correlations _ in three different billiards : the 2d hyperbola billiard , the 2d sinai billiard and the 3d sinai billiard .",
    "one possible approach is to compute @xmath101 directly for various @xmath67-windows .",
    "a smoothing procedure is then essential in order to get rid of fluctuations .",
    "our numerical strategy is different .",
    "we prefer to fix the @xmath67-window and to vary @xmath87 .",
    "our object of study is the correlation factor @xmath632 . in order to avoid numerical artifacts",
    "we have not applied a smoothing procedure .",
    "rather , the cumulative quantity is considered , namely @xmath633 here @xmath634 is over all the distinct _ lengths _ within a given @xmath67-window , and @xmath635 is over all the pos that correspond to a given length @xmath60 .",
    "we have divided @xmath174 by @xmath636 which is the effective degeneracy within the specified window .",
    "this has been done in order to get rid of the trivial correlation factor which appears due to symmetries . this way the integrand always approaches @xmath11 for @xmath637 . fixing the @xmath67-window and probing the spectrum within the specified window with larger and larger @xmath87 is both mathematically appealing and numerically convenient .",
    "( it is less convenient to fix @xmath87 and to vary @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is because our classical databases is limited to a narrow span of @xmath67 values , while @xmath87 is a free parameter that can be set to any value .",
    "if the form factor complies with rmt predictions , then we expect ( see subsection  [ subsec : ckl ] ) : @xmath638 and consequently @xmath639 the above strictly holds for gue , and holds approximately for goe .",
    "the desymmetrized hyperbola billiard is a planar billiard that is defined by the curves @xmath640 .",
    "the billiard was throughly studied by sieber @xcite .",
    "the compliance of @xmath641 with goe for the desymmetrized hyperbola billiard was already demonstrated numerically in @xcite .",
    "there a database of about 100000 pos with length @xmath642 ( not including time reversal ) has been used . here",
    "we wish merely to demonstrate our numerical procedure using the same database @xcite and to illustrate the utility of @xmath643 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ickl - hyperbola ] , where we choose a few @xmath67 intervals with @xmath644 .",
    "the overall @xmath87-dependence of the numerical data agrees quite well with the theoretical curves of goe and is markedly different from the poissonian ( no correlations ) case .",
    "this is a clear indication of the existence of classical po - correlations that indeed conspire to give the correct goe form factor .",
    "the agreement of numerical and theoretical data is also an indication to the correct @xmath67 dependence , at least on average .",
    "the changes in @xmath67 of the theoretical curves ( goe ) between the lower and upper values of the @xmath67 s considered are minute in comparison to the numerical dispersion , and therefore it is impossible to reach any definite conclusion concerning the detailed @xmath67 dependence .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the above investigation of po - correlations was purely classical .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to enquire whether the quantal levels `` feel '' the observed classical po - correlations . to do this , we compared @xmath645 ( based on the left hand side of ( [ eq : mbcft ] ) ) to @xmath646 ( based on the right hand side of the same equation ) .",
    "the quantal from factor @xmath647 was computed from the exact quantal levels and velocities , and @xmath646 was computed from the classical po data ( we did not assume any sum rule ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : miktqm ] .",
    "note , that we integrated the resulting form factors in @xmath67 to diminish fluctuations , and started the integration at @xmath648 where the density of pos is already very high . evidently , the classical diagonal approximation @xmath649 is consistently and significantly larger than @xmath647 in the @xmath444 regime that we checked .",
    "strong classical non - trivial correlations are therefore needed in order to `` bend '' @xmath650 down to the correct @xmath647 .",
    "indeed , in the relevant @xmath444 domain , the classical correlation factor @xmath651 for the dominant @xmath652 contribution is @xmath653 ( see figure [ fig : ickl - sb3d - n123 ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , if we multiply @xmath650 by the numerical factor @xmath654 , then we get on the average compliance with the quantum results , as seen in figure  [ fig : miktqm ] .",
