    "in such systems two - dimensionality allows very precise control of the carrier density by a gate which enables tuning of the electron - phonon interaction.@xcite electron - phonon interaction in graphene has been studied previously@xcite , but with the recent advances in fabrication of devices based on other 2d materials , like the first demonstration of a silicene transistor@xcite , further studies of interaction phenomena in 2d materials are necessary .",
    "when comparing the electrical performance of devices one often considers the carrier mobility of the materials .",

    "parameter - free methods can be used to address how close experiments are to ideal conductivities and if further optimization of fabrication techniques and device designs for novel 2d materials could improve device performance .",

    "in addition , we perform calculations of the low - field mobility and its dependence on carrier density and temperature to obtain a better understanding of transport in graphene , silicene and mos@xmath0 . despite the fact that several papers have presented schemes for obtaining electron - phonon coupling and mobilities from first - principles calculations , only few applications exist and the methods are by no means standard .",

    "the obtained mobilities should be taken as upper limits and if the za scattering is included as is it would reduce the mobility by two orders of magnitude .",
    "for both silicene and mos@xmath0 , we find that the rates only changes slightly if the fermi - level is reduced further .",
    "for mos@xmath0 the scattering rate is almost independent of @xmath153 for @xmath154 ; only the scattering rates for the lo@xmath0 and la modes reduces slightly at high energy . unlike the scattering related to microscopic changes in potential ( deformation potential or nonpolar optical scattering ) , the scattering related to the macroscopic electric - field ( piezoelectric or frhlich interaction ) will be partially screened by a dielectric environment .",
    "one approach to handle this difference in screening is to partition electron - phonon interaction in real - space into the short - ranged deformation potential contributions and long - ranged piezoelectric and frhlich interactions and apply the screening individually@xcite .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratesiliceneandmos2]b the frhlich interaction ( lo@xmath0 mode ) is not dominating the transport and the piezoelectric coupling is most important at low temperatures@xcite .      in fig .",

    "experiments have so far achieved room temperature values decreasing from roughly @xmath164 to @xmath165 at the same carrier densities.@xcite the same experiment also obtain mobilities up to @xmath156 at lower temperatures .",
    "in addition , we find the mobility of silicene to be more than an order of magnitude lower than graphene but still very high .",
    "we obtain a mobility of roughly @xmath166 at @xmath159 and a carrier density of @xmath163 .",
    "previous calculations have only considered ungated silicene and obtained values in the range of @xmath167 at @xmath159.@xcite the only experiment on silicene presently published achieve a mobility of roughly @xmath168 at @xmath159.@xcite for mos@xmath0 our calculated mobility decreases from a value of @xmath169 at @xmath157 to approximately @xmath170 at @xmath159 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with published first - principles simulations and experimental values.@xcite in comparison , experiments have achieved up to @xmath171 at @xmath159.@xcite    we note that the electron - phonon coupling as a function of @xmath13 , as was shown for all materials for a single @xmath37-point , was evaluated at all @xmath37-points in the mobility calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] .",
    "another approach that is often applied is to evaluate the scattering rate along a single @xmath37-line obtained from a @xmath172 at a fixed @xmath37-point .",
    "this can be transformed to a generic energy - dependence which is used to evaluate the mobility .",
    "this approach however , neglects part of the anisotropy in the bulk electron - phonon coupling , which was included in the present results .",
    "we only included intravalley scattering in the previous figures .",
    "however , it is straightforward to evaluate the intervalley scattering rate separately by doing a calculation with the same @xmath37-mesh and shifting the @xmath13-mesh to @xmath173 .",
    "we have done so for all three materials along a single @xmath37-line to evaluate at what temperatures and carrier densities the intervalley scattering might start contributing .    in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : mobility]a .",
    "the reason is that intervalley scattering requires a phonon momentum connecting the two valleys @xmath177 where the lowest energy phonon modes ( za and zo around @xmath178 ) only exist above @xmath179mev in the case of graphene , cf . fig .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath183 so that intervalley scattering does not contribute significantly , whereas for silicene intervalley scattering seems to make a significant contribution above @xmath184 .",
    "our definition of the onset for intervalley contribution is that we obtain an intervalley scattering rate of the same order of magnitude as for the intravalley scattering . using matthiessen s rule",
    "@xmath185 we can estimate that the total mobility will decrease by approximately a factor of two at carrier densities above @xmath176 if intervalley scattering was included for graphene .",
    "for mos@xmath0 the contribution will be much smaller at assessable carrier densities , whereas silicene can have as much as an order of magnitude lower mobility due to intervalley scattering for carrier densities above @xmath184 .",

    "our results compares well to published theoretical results and experiments for mos@xmath0 and graphene and extends previous theoretical calculations for silicene .",
    "the bulk electron - phonon coupling is highly anisotropic due to scattering suppression in different @xmath134-directions , as well as a nontrivial @xmath134-dependence , related to the combined symmetry of the electron and phonon states .",
    "the simulations provide an upper bound for the electron mobilities of the selected 2d materials .",
    "the _ ab initio _ approach demonstrated in this paper can be directly applied to other materials in both 1d , 2d and 3d , larger nanostructures and may be straightforwardly extended to study cases with electron - impurity scattering .",
    "in addition , we have illustrated how the reduction of the lattice symmetry , when going from graphene to silicene with no planar symmetry and further on to mos@xmath0 with no inversion symmetry , leads to additional scattering mechanisms and modes interacting with the charge carriers .",
    "this makes a strong case for the need of a fully numerical solution of the bte together with a first - principles method to evaluate the bulk electron - phonon interaction - especially , when going to systems with many modes , such as systems with low lattice symmetry , slab structures and nanostructured materials .",
