    "after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec)@xcite , it becomes an interesting topic in science@xcite .",
    "this physical system has close relation with other important physical problems in condense matter , e.g. bloch oscillations@xcite , wannier - stark ladders@xcite , josephson junction arrays@xcite and superfluid to the mott - insulator transition@xcite .",
    "behavior of a rotating bec in an optical lattice is similar to that of a superconductor in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "when there is just trap potential without the lattice structure , the abrikasov vortex lattice can be observed just like type ii superconductors@xcite . when the lattice structure is added to system , the question of the vortex lattice in ground state becomes more complicated@xcite .",
    "there are many experimental studies on this system with optical lattices of different symmetries , specially with square lattice@xcite . with some criteria",
    "this problem can be mapped to problem josephson junction arrays ( jjas ) and numerical experiments show that vortex lattice is same for both the systems@xcite .",
    "we focus on study of problem in this regime and extend our previous results@xcite for an optical lattice with square symmetry .",
    "we calculate vortex configuration for few rational rotation numbers and show that there is good agreement with experimental results on rotating bec and reported result for josephson junctions lattices@xcite .",
    "structure of paper is as follows : in section ii we formulate problem in jja regime . in section iii",
    "we focus on vortex lattice with rational rotation numbers and compare our result with previous experimental and numerical results . in the last section main results are highlighted and suggestions for future works have been given .",
    "hamiltonian for a bec in an optical lattice with a rotation frequency @xmath0 is , @xmath1\\hat{\\psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the atomic mass and @xmath3 the coupling constant with the @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath5 .",
    "conservation of the total number of particles is ensured by chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "the external potential @xmath7 consists of two parts : modified harmonic potential @xmath8 and the potential of the optical lattice @xmath9 , which may be chosen as periodic@xcite , quasiperiodic@xcite , or random@xcite . for example , the potential with square symmetry can be written as @xmath10 $ ] , with the periodicity @xmath11 .    for a large @xmath12",
    ", we can suppose that the system is frozen in the axial direction .",
    "if the energy due to the interaction and the rotation is small compared to the energy separation between the lowest and the first excited band , the particles are confined to the lowest wannier orbitals@xcite .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath13 in the wannier basis as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the analog of the magnetic vector potential , @xmath16 the normalized wannier wave - function localized in the @xmath17-th well and @xmath18 the number operator . substituting [ wannier ] in the hamiltonian [ bechami ]",
    "leads to the bose - hubbard model in the rotating frame :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 means @xmath17 and @xmath21 are nearest neighbors , @xmath22 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath23 an energy offset of each lattice site and @xmath24 the on - site energy .",
    "the rotation effect is described by @xmath25 proportional to the line integral of @xmath26 between the @xmath17-th and @xmath21-th sites : @xmath27 .",
    "if the number of atoms per site is large ( @xmath28 ) , the operator can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and phase , and the amplitude by the @xmath29-number as @xmath30 . using @xmath31 and @xmath32 , eq .",
    "[ bosehubbard ] reduces to the quantum phase model : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "also , the atoms are assumed to be distributed such as they satisfy the condition @xmath35 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath36 decreases from the central sites outward since @xmath37 has the profile of an inverted parabola as we can see from solution of 1d case in fig .",
    "[ oned ] .",
    "is enveloped by an inverted parabola shape.,width=566 ]    [ oned ]    eq .",
    "2.4 is just the hamiltonian of a lattice of small josephson junctions with inhomogeneous coupling constants @xmath36 . with @xmath38",
    ", we can neglect the kinetic energy term ; moreover , we suppose that coupling constants are equal @xmath39 .",
    "we also check the robustness of the results for non - uniform coupling .",
    "this regime can be achieved when the depth of the optical lattice @xmath40 is between 18 and 25@xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the recoil energy ) and the average particle number is @xmath43@xcite .",
    "then we have : @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "our purpose is to find the minimum of this hamiltonian as a function of the condensate phases @xmath46 with two constrains as follows .",
    "first constraint originates in the single valuedness of the wave function which leads to the quantization of vorticity : @xmath47 where sum is over @xmath48th plaquette , @xmath49 is the area of @xmath48th plaquette , and @xmath50 is integer . in the case of a condensate with the rigid - body rotation , _ the frustration parameter _",
    "is defined as @xmath51 with the quantum circulation @xmath52 . in two dimensional arrays , frustration represents density of vortices per the number of the plaquettes @xcite .",
    "the second constraint comes from conservation of the particles numbers .",
    "the particle current from the nodes can be assumed as the derivation of the energy function with respect to the corresponding phase@xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 where sum is over all @xmath21 which is connected to @xmath17th node .",
    "since hamiltonian is periodic , @xmath50 can be @xmath54 or @xmath55 , and we can replace them by @xmath50 which is zero or one , and replace @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "these two set of equations can completely determine all @xmath58 for a given set of @xmath50 .",
    "also , for a lattice , number of plaquettes plus number of nodes is equal to number of connections minus one ; therefore one of the equations ( e.g. one of particle conservation equations ) can be neglected . assuming the particle flow from the nodes are small , we can linearize the eq.[ccons ] i.e. @xmath59 . now",
    ", we have a linear set of equations which must be solved for a given set of integers @xmath50 , i.e. for a vortex configuration .",
    "energy of this vortex configuration is denoted by @xmath60 . then instead of original minimization scheme",
    ", we can use the set of these energies for minimization of hamiltonian .",
    "it means that minimum of hamiltonian correspond to a vortex configuration which minimizes these set of energies , with number of vortex configuration equal to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is number of plaquettes in the lattice .",
    "we consider the square lattice and present the result of above formulation for some rational values of @xmath63 .",
    "when the number of the plaquettes becomes large , the checkerboard vortex structure of ground state can be observed@xcite .",
    "the same pattern can be observed in the trapped bec@xcite .",
    "we show that our formulation has the same result .",
    "set of the equations [ fq ] and the linearized version of [ ccons ] for the square lattice can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a the vector representation of the gauge invariant phase differences and @xmath66 is the matrix of coefficients : , @xmath67 for @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is number of rows and @xmath71 is number of columns ; and for @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is zero for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "these equations can solved for any given @xmath79 and set of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the result for the minimum vortex configuration for an square lattice with @xmath82 , @xmath83 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sq2d44 ] for @xmath84 . in this case for @xmath85 , @xmath80 could be zero or one .",

    "the minimum vortex configuration shows the checkerboard pattern which is known for frustrated @xmath87 model@xcite .",

    "the checkerboard pattern is seen for the vortex configuration in the ground state . in both cases",
    ", we can see that there is an extra vortex in the boundary of the lattice .",
    "this is a boundary effect and can be ignored in large lattice limit .",
    "these results are in agreement with experimental results on rotating bec@xcite .",
    "square lattice for @xmath88,width=377 ]    [ sq2d442 ]    when number of plaquettes increases , number of possible vortex configurations , increases and we can use a combination of this method with monte - carlo method@xcite .",
    "we see that in our approximation , the coupling of jja changes as the inverted parabola . here , we discuss the effect of changing the coupling constants on the minimum vortex configuration .",
    "we consider an inverted parabola @xmath37 , @xmath89\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath90th site of square lattice , where @xmath91 is the number of columns and @xmath92 is the number of rows .",
    "the coupling between two nearest neighbor sites on the lattice can be found from @xmath93 which gives a better approximation comparing to the uniform couplings .",
    "result for the same situation as fig .",
    "[ sq2d44 ] , is shown in fig .",
    "[ robust1 ] .",
    "it is seen that the minimum vortex configuration is not affected by the change of the coupling configuration .",
