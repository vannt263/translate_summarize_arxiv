    "the physical processes that start the explosion of massive stars are still not well understood , although this is of crucial importance for predicting supernova and remnant properties , nucleosynthesis conditions and yields , and the observable signals from supernovae like neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "neutrinos are thought to be the main agent of energy transport and energy loss from collapsing stars , an expectation that was spectacularly verified by the detection of two dozen neutrinos in connection with supernova  1987a .",
    "colgate & white ( 1966 ) suggested already 40 years ago that the intense flux of neutrinos radiated from the nascent neutron star might deposit the energy needed to reverse the stellar collapse .",
    "the detailed physics of this neutrino - driven mechanism , however , was worked out only later , based on numerical results of wilson ( 1985 ) .",
    "bethe & wilson ( 1985 ) showed that neutrinos deposit their energy behind the stalled supernova shock front mainly by the absorption of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on free neutrons and protons , respectively , which are the most abundant nuclear species in the postshock layer . provided the neutrino luminosities are sufficiently large , this energy input was found to be so strong that the stagnating shock can be `` revived '' and thus accelerates outward to propagate through the overlying , still collapsing layers of the star .",
    "the viability of this neutrino - heating mechanism has recently been demonstrated for stars near the lower mass end of supernova progenitors for stiff as well as soft nuclear equations of state ( kitaura , janka , & hillebrandt  2006 ; janka , marek , & kitaura 2007 ; janka et al .",
    "the investigated progenitor with a main - sequence mass of 8.8@xmath0 ( nomoto 1984 , 1987 ) can be considered as representative of the @xmath4810@xmath0 range .",
    "the cores of such stars consist of oxygen , neon , and magnesium instead of iron and possess an extremely steep density gradient at their surface .",
    "the latter fact leads to a very rapid decrease of the mass accretion rate onto the forming neutron star , enabling the stalled shock to continue its expansion .",
    "this creates favorable conditions for neutrino energy deposition , thus allowing a neutrino - driven baryonic wind to be launched , which is sufficiently powerful to eject the gravitationally loosely bound outer layers of the star .",
    "the new results confirm qualitatively previous simulations by mayle & wilson ( 1988 ) , although the more sophisticated treatment of the neutrino transport in the new models , which were computed with the prometheus - vertex code , leads to the predictions of a lower explosion energy and a lower neutron excess in the ejecta .    in case of more massive progenitors ,",
    "wilson & mayle ( 1988 , 1993 ) could obtain explosions only by assuming that the neutrino luminosities and thus the neutrino energy deposition behind the stalled shock were boosted by enhanced neutrino transport in the neutron star . according to wilson & mayle",
    "this could happen , e.g. , because of the presence of neutron - finger instabilities below the neutrinosphere .",
    "the existence of neutron - finger unstable conditions , however , was repudiated on grounds of a detailed analysis of the neutrino transport conditions in supernova cores ( bruenn & dineva 1996 ) . nevertheless , numerical simulations ( buras et al .  2006b ; see also dessart et al .",
    "2006 ) showed that ledoux convection occurs inside the proto - neutron star and later than about 200@xmath1ms after bounce leads to accelerated lepton number and energy losses because of significantly increased muon and tau neutrino luminosities .",
    "the fluxes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are mostly responsible for the shock heating , however , hardly change on a post - bounce timescale of some hundred milliseconds , and the mean energies of the radiated neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors even decrease compared to models that ignore convection .",
    "a potentially stronger multi - dimensional effect that is clearly supportive for delayed shock revival , was discovered to be convective overturn in the layer behind the stagnant shock . in this region neutrino heating",
    "tends to create a negative entropy gradient , because the energy deposition is maximal just outside of the gain radius ( herant et al .",
    "1994 ; burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 , janka & mller 1996 ) .",
    "cooler matter that is accreted by the shock is carried in narrow downdrafts closer to the gain radius , where it readily absorbs energy from the neutrinos . at the same time , heated matter with its higher entropy becomes buoyant and starts rising and expanding , thus reducing energy loss by the reemission of neutrinos and pushing the shock farther out .",
    "convective overturn therefore improves the efficiency of the neutrino energy transfer because it allows more matter to be exposed to strong heating near the gain radius .",
    "effectively this means that the mass in the gain layer grows and that gas stays there for a longer time .",
    "this is reflected by an increase of the mean timescale @xmath5 needed by accreted matter to move inward from the shock to the gain radius",
    ". a larger value of @xmath5 implies that the ratio of the advection timescale to the neutrino - heating timescale , @xmath6 , gets closer to unity , which is a necessary condition for a model to approach an explosion ( see the analysis in buras et al .",
    "2006b ; thompson , quataert , & burrows 2005 ; murphy & burrows 2008 ) .",
    "convection in the flow between shock and gain layer , however , is subject to strong damping because the gas is falling rapidly and the time for seed perturbations to grow is therefore short until the gas crosses the gain radius and reaches the ledoux - stable cooling region ( foglizzo , scheck , & janka 2006 ) .",
    "convective activity is therefore _ not _ able to develop in the gain layer despite the negative entropy gradient there , unless the initial density perturbations are sufficiently large or the ratio of advection timescale to convective growth timescale , @xmath7 , exceeds a critical value ( for more details , see scheck et al .",
    "2008 ) . two - dimensional ( 2d ) supernova simulations ( buras et al .  2006a , b ) with the prometheus - vertex code , employing a sophisticated energy - dependent description of the neutrino transport ,",
    "indeed show that convective overturn in the hot - bubble region becomes much less vigorous than in previous multi - dimensional models with a grey neutrino diffusion scheme ( e.g. , herant et al .",
    "1994 ; burrows et al .  1995 ; fryer 1999 ; fryer & warren 2002 , 2004 ) , mainly because the accretion shock in the new models lingers at rather small radii and the correspondingly high infall velocities in the postshock region are unfavorable for the growth of convection .",
    "scheck et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , performing parametric hydrodynamic studies of the post - bounce accretion phase in collapsing stellar cores , found that convection is suppressed when ( i ) the neutrino heating is too weak to produce a steep entropy gradient behind the shock , or ( ii ) the rapid contraction of the nascent neutron star leads to shock retraction and thus causes very short infall timescales of the gas between shock and gain radius .    in such a situation ,",
    "however , the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ; blondin , mezzcappa , & demarino 2003 ) , which is a generic hydrodynamic instability of the shocked accretion flow to non - radial deformation modes , can exhibit particularly large growth rates ( cf .",
    "scheck et al .  2008 ) and becomes the dominant multi - dimensional phenomenon to initiate shock expansion .",
    "this was seen in the studies by scheck et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and is confirmed by the linear stability analysis of yamasaki & yamada ( 2007 ) .",
    "the sasi stimulates large - amplitude bipolar shock oscillations , which create strong entropy variations in the postshock flow and thus trigger violent secondary convection .",
    "this helps pushing the stalled shock to larger radii and therefore stretches the time accreted matter is exposed to neutrino heating in the gain layer , establishing healthy conditions for the success of the neutrino - driven mechanism .",
    "such a decisive role of the sasi was indeed observed in case of an 11.2@xmath0 progenitor , whose collapse and explosion were simulated with the prometheus - vertex code ( buras et al .",
    "only when the setup of the numerical grid did not prohibit the growth of the lowest ( dipolar and quadrupolar ) sasi modes ) around the equatorial plane , using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this setup prevented the occurrence of the dipole and quadrupole sasi modes .",
    "] , which have the largest growth rates , could an explosion be obtained .",
    "convection alone was too weak to yield sufficient support for the neutrino - heating mechanism .",
    "instead it was the sasi in the first place which pushed the shock farther out and helped to bring the ratio of advection timescale to neutrino - heating timescale closer to the critical value of unity , which is necessary for reversing accretion to explosion .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism that is responsible for the sasi phenomenon is still controversial and currently a matter of vivid debate .",
    "foglizzo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) explain the sasi by an advective - acoustic cycle ( see also foglizzo 2001 , 2002 , 2008 ) .",
    "this interpretation is in agreement with many properties of the instability observed in the hydrodynamic simulations of scheck et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and of ohnishi , kotake , & yamada ( 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , blondin & mezzacappa ( 2006 ) and blondin & shaw ( 2007 ) advocate a purely acoustic cycle as the cause of the low - mode sasi and see this hypothesis supported by their numerical studies .    in this paper",
    "we will present evidence that the sasi - aided neutrino - heating mechanism may initiate an explosion not only in the case of an 11.2@xmath0 progenitor as recently seen by buras et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but in a wider mass range of progenitor stars .",
    "we study here a 15@xmath0 model ( s15s7b2 from woosley & weaver 1995 ) which is frequently used in previous and present core - collapse studies because it can be considered as representative of stars in a larger mass interval .",
    "stellar evolution calculations by woosley , heger , & weaver ( 2002 ) , for example , produced a very similar core structure also for other supernova progenitors up to about 20@xmath0 ( see model s20.0 in figs .",
    "a.2 and a.3 of buras et al .",
    "we discuss results of a 2d simulation in which a modest amount of rotation was assumed and which develops an explosion at 600@xmath1ms after core bounce , and compare it with non - exploding spherically symmetric ( 1d ) simulations on the one hand , and 2d models without rotation on the other , in which two different equations of state ( eoss ) for supernova matter are used , namely the lattimer & swesty ( 1991 ) eos with a soft nuclear phase and the hillebrandt , wolff , & nomoto ( 1984 ; see also hillebrandt & wolff 1985 ) eos with a significantly stiffer nuclear phase ( hillebrandt 1994 ) .",
    "both are consistent with current neutron star mass determinations but the former leads to significantly more compact proto - neutron stars than the latter .",
    "the rotating pre - collapse iron core has a spin period of about 12 seconds .",
    "this is roughly a factor of ten more rapid than predicted by recent stellar evolution models including magnetic fields ( heger , woosley , & spruit 2005 ) , but considerably slower than necessary for magnetohydrodynamics to be important in triggering the explosion , which requires pre - collapse spin periods of 23 seconds ( burrows et al .",
    "2007a , thompson et al .  2005 ) .",
    "we have also evaluated our simulations for the presence of gravity waves in the nascent neutron star .",
    "burrows et al.(2006 , 2007b ) found in their 2d supernova models that the anisotropic accretion flow ( as a consequence of the sasi ) excited the neutron star to vigorous g - mode oscillations , in particular also the dipole ( @xmath8 ) mode .",
    "later than about one second after bounce , the amplitude of these oscillations became very large ( about 3@xmath1 km ) at the neutron star surface and the neutron star as a whole showed a large - amplitude periodic displacement along the @xmath9-axis of the numerical grid ( burrows et al .",
    "2007c ) . as a consequence",
    ", a sizable acoustic energy flux was driven into the surrounding gas and was transporting a significant amount of acoustic energy to the stalled supernova shock .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "did not find any neutrino - driven explosions in their models .",
    "however , at late times ( typically at @xmath10s after bounce ) , and therefore much later than the shock is revived by the neutrino - heating mechanism in the 11.2@xmath0 simulation of buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) and in the 15@xmath0 model discussed here , the acoustic energy flux caused by the core g - mode oscillations became dominant compared to neutrino heating and was able to cause an explosion . in our simulations",
    "the g - mode oscillations of the newly formed neutron star have always such small amplitudes that the acoustic energy input to the developing blast is negligible compared to neutrino energy deposition .",
    "in order to figure out whether our neutrino - hydrodynamics code is able to deal with this potentially important physical effect , we have also performed numerical tests .",
    "these demonstrate that our code is well able to track large - amplitude g - modes , also of dipole character , if such modes are excited in the neutron star core .",
    "we do not find any reason why our third - order hydrodynamics scheme with the chosen numerical resolution should not be able to follow the long - term excitation of neutron star oscillations by anisotropic accretion and turbulence in the sasi region between neutron star and shock front .",
    "whether the excitation could be more efficient at times later than currently followed in our simulations ( at most about 630@xmath1ms after bounce ) remains unanswered and must be left for future exploration .",
    "the reason why burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007b ) did not see any neutrino - driven explosions , which is in contrast to our findings , is not clear . however , the numerical approaches of both groups and the included physics are different in many aspects , and therefore it is not astonishing that for example the rate of neutrino energy deposition behind the supernova shock differs significantly between the calculations . while our `` ray - by - ray plus '' treatment of neutrino transport is highly sophisticated in dealing with the energy dependence of the problem but describes its dependence on the polar angle only approximately , burrows et al.applied a 2d neutrino diffusion scheme , in which the energy dependence was only incompletely taken into account , because energy - bin coupling was ignored and doppler effects due to the motion of the stellar fluid were neglected . in addition , the tucson collaboration made use of a different numerical method to solve the hydrodynamics equations , e.g.  the gravitational force was implemented in the momentum equation in an uncommon , momentum - conserving way . in their vulcan code",
    "they employed a polar grid only in the outer regions of the computational volume but cartesian coordinates in the central part .",
    "they performed their simulations with the nuclear eos of shen et al .",

    "moreover , their models were computed with purely newtonian gravity , whereas a significantly stronger relativistic gravitational potential according to marek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is applied in our models .",
    "in fact , newtonian 2d simulations in which the confluence of neutrino heating , the sasi , and nuclear burning produced explosions of 11 and 15@xmath0 progenitors , have recently been reported by bruenn et al .",

    "their transport scheme , however , was based on a flux - limited diffusion description , in which the energy - dependence of the transport was treated in full detail .",

    "the core - collapse and post - bounce calculations presented in this work are performed with the prometheus - vertex neutrino - hydrodynamics code , details of which were published by rampp & janka ( 2002 ) and buras et al ( 2006a ) .",
    "the code module that integrates the nonrelativistic hydrodynamics equations is a conservative and explicit eulerian implementation of a godunov - type scheme with higher - order spatial and temporal accuracy .",
    "the self - gravity of the stellar gas is treated in an approximation to general relativity , in which the monopole term of the newtonian potential is replaced by an effective relativistic scalar potential that was constructed from close comparison of the newtonian and relativistic equations of motion ( for details , see marek et al .",
    "2006 ) . for this effective relativistic monopole potential",
    "we consider the cases  a and r of the marek et al .",
    "the higher - order terms of the gravitational potential are taken as solutions of the poisson equation for the two - dimensional gas distribution ( see mller & steinmetz 1995 ) .",
    "the time - implicit transport routine solves the moment equations of neutrino number , energy , and momentum in spherical symmetry , employing a variable eddington factor for closing the set of equations ( rampp & janka 2002 )",
    ". the closure factor is obtained from a simplified boltzmann equation , whose integro - differential character is tackled by iterating the coupled system of boltzmann and moment equations until convergence is achieved .",
    "our treatment of the neutrino transport and of neutrino - matter interactions is energy dependent and includes the full redistribution of neutrinos in energy and momentum space by scattering reactions with electrons , positrons , and nucleons .",
    "effects caused by the motion of the stellar fluid are taken into account as well as general relativistic redshifting and time dilation .",
    "in two spatial dimensions the transport is based on the `` ray - by - ray plus '' approximation , in which spherically symmetric transport problems are solved for the conditions present in the radial `` rays '' corresponding to the different lateral bins of the polar grid .",
    "this means that we assume the local neutrino phase - space distribution to be axially symmetric around the radial direction and thus to depend only on one instead of two angles , as a consequence of which the neutrino pressure tensor remains diagonal and the lateral component of the neutrino flux vanishes .",
    "this simplifies the transport from a five dimensional , time - dependent problem ( with variables being the radius , energy , polar angle , and two angles that characterize the neutrino momentum direction ) to only four dimensions and reduces the complexity of the moment equations significantly ( see appendix  b in buras et al .",
    "2006a ) at the expense of neutrino shear and non - radial flux of the neutrinos , which are disregarded in such an approach .",
    "however , the moment equations still contain the terms that account for the advection of trapped neutrinos with the stellar fluid motion in the lateral direction .",
    "moreover , the lateral component of the neutrino pressure gradient is included in the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "comparison of our approximative treatment of general relativity with fully relativistic simulations revealed excellent agreement in spherical symmetry and still good agreement in two dimensions when the rotation did not become too extreme ( see marek et al .",

    "the effects of nucleon recoil and thermal motions as well as nucleon correlations in the dense medium are taken into account ( see buras et al .  2006a , and references therein ) .",
    "neutrino - nucleon scattering just like neutrino - electron scattering is therefore a channel for energy exchange between neutrinos and the stellar medium and fosters neutrino thermalization , thus leading to a noticeable reduction of the mean energy and a spectral pinching of radiated neutrinos , in particular of muon and tau flavor ( keil , raffelt , & janka 2003 ) .",

    "we employ two different nuclear equations of state ( eoss ) in our simulations . on the one hand",
    ", we use a soft version of the compressible liquid drop eos of lattimer & swesty ( 1991 ; see also lattimer et al .",

    "on the other hand we perform simulations with the considerably stiffer eos of hillebrandt & wolff ( 1985 , see also hillebrandt et al .  1984 ; `` hw - eos '' ) , which is based on a hartree - fock calculation , assuming a skyrme force for the nucleon - nucleon interaction with parameters given by khler ( 1975 ) .",
    "its incompressibility has a value of 263@xmath1mev and the symmetry energy was chosen to be 32.9@xmath1mev .",

    "both eoss also lead to a significantly different evolution of the radius of the nascent neutron star as a function time ( see fig .  7 in janka",
    "et al .  2007 ) .",
    "while the ls - eos produces rather compact neutron stars with a radius of @xmath14 km for a cold star with 1.4@xmath0 and @xmath15 km for a cold star near the maximum mass , the corresponding radii are 13.94@xmath1 km and 13.5@xmath1 km , respectively , for the hw - eos ( cf .",

    "for models with core rotation , however , the best choice of the effective gravitational potential is less obvious .",

    "our models are computed with 4001000 non - equidistant radial zones , which are chosen such that the resolution @xmath26 is typically better than three percent in the interior of the neutron star and between less than one percent and 1.5 percent around the neutrinospheres and outside of the neutron star . during the simulations",
    "the number of radial grid zones @xmath27 is increased ( table  [ tab : models ] gives @xmath27 at the beginning and at the end of the different runs ) and the region of higher resolution is moved to smaller radii in order to follow the contraction of the neutron star and to ensure good resolution at the neutron star surface where the density gradient steepens with time .",
    "we make sure that at least 20 radial zones are used per density decade , corresponding to at most 12% density variation between neighboring zones .",
    "the representation of hydrostatic equilibrium as well as the accurate computation of the neutrino transport in the decoupling layer require at least this numerical resolution ; in case of the transport the luminosity variation from zone to zone is a limiting factor .",
    "convergence tests for our code showed that insufficient radial resolution in particular in this region may not only lead to bloated surface layers of the neutron star and to an overestimation of the neutrino luminosities , but as a consequence also to artificial explosions even of spherically symmetric models . in order to make sure that our exploding 2d simulation , model  m15ls - rot , is well resolved",

    "running 2d models with a sophisticated energy - dependent treatment of the neutrino transport for many hundred milliseconds after bounce poses a considerable numerical challenge , because the rapid variations of the accretion flow in the presence of violent hydrodynamic instabilities in the postshock region do not allow the ( implicit ) neutrino transport timestep to become larger than about @xmath28s and therefore about 500.000 timesteps and @xmath29 floating point operations were needed for our most advanced 2d model ms15ls - rot , which was evolved to more than 600@xmath1ms after bounce .",

    "these effects help to keep accreted matter in the gain layer for a longer period of time ( a consequence of which is the increasing mass in this layer ) .",
    "this supports the energy deposition by neutrinos and thus facilitates the explosion .",
    "so , although the kinetic energy associated with the sasi remains negligible for the explosion energetics , once the sasi and convection have pushed the shock sufficiently far out , prolonged neutrino heating and ultimately also the additional energy release by nucleon recombination ( or , similarly , energy savings by only partial dissociation of nuclei in the shock - accreted gas ) set up the conditions for runaway .    the contributing effects in the postshock accretion flow , the sasi , convection , and neutrino heating , however , are strongly linked and interdependent in a complex way . in such a highly nonlinear situation",
    "it is therefore extremely difficult to exactly determine the influence of each aspect individually .",

    "different from our successful 15@xmath0 run , the neutrino - powered explosion was found to set in much earlier , namely already at about 200@xmath1ms after bounce .",
    "the importance of the presence of low - mode sasi oscillations for the development of the blast in this case was concluded from the comparison with a simulation that was computed with the same input physics but with the lateral grid constrained to a 90-degree wedge around the equatorial plane of the polar coordinate system and periodic boundary conditions .",

    "interestingly , marek ( 2007 ) obtained an explosion for the 11.2@xmath0 progenitor when he reran the model with a 90-degree grid extending from the pole to the equator with reflecting boundaries , thus assuming equatorial symmetry and excluding the @xmath52 mode but giving room for the mirror symmetric @xmath53 mode .",
    "this result was recently confirmed by murphy & burrows ( 2008 ) and shows that obviously the support of strong quadrupolar sasi motions makes already a significant difference compared to a case where both lowest - order spherical harmonics are suppressed .",
    "here we present some results for a continuation of the 11.2@xmath0 explosion simulation of buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "due to the larger timesteps that were possible in this case , we could evolve the model further into the explosion .",
    "the results are therefore of interest in the present context because they provide insight into the way the explosion strengthens at evolution stages that we were unable to reach in the 15@xmath0 run .",
    "figure  [ fig : massshells11 ] displays the mass - shell evolution as deduced from the ( mass - weighted ) angle - averaged 2d data of the simulation .",
    "grey or yellow shading of different regions gives rough information about the nuclear composition in the corresponding layers .",

    ", the larger abundance of @xmath18-particles reduces the consumption of thermal energy for breaking up strongly bound nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig : massshells11 ] also shows that the shock reaches the infall layers containing a mass fraction of more than 10% oxygen at @xmath92ms after bounce only after it has already propagated to more than 700@xmath1 km .    at that time the shock is already half way through the supersonically collapsing inner shells of the progenitor star and on average rushes outward with a radial velocity of 10,000@xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath24 ( fig .",

    "the shock surface has a highly deformed prolate shape with an @xmath93-axis ratio of more than 2:1 ( figs .",

    "large lobes filled with neutrino - heated , high - entropy gas expand into the northern and southern hemispheres and are continuously fed with fresh material that is channelled in a long - lived , very stable equatorial accretion funnel from behind the shock to the close vicinity of the gain radius to absorb energy there from neutrinos .",
    "the situation is very similar to what we observed in the case of our 15@xmath0 explosion model ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : postbounce ] ) . until the end of the simulated evolution , the outward moving , hot gas in the two big lobes ( the northern one being slightly larger ) has accumulated a positive total ( internal plus kinetic plus gravitational ) energy of nearly @xmath88erg with a tendency of steep rise ( fig .  [",
    "fig : expener11 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the pronounced asphericity has the consequence that the shock reaches the silicon - oxygen interface near the equatorial plane later than in the polar directions ( see the panels for @xmath94ms and 275@xmath1ms after bounce in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots11 ] ) .",
    "therefore a wedge - like region around the equator remains for some time , where silicon and sulfur are still present with higher abundances between the shock and the oxygen layer , while the matter swept up by the shock consists mostly of iron - group nuclei and @xmath18-particles .",
    "the mass - shell plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : massshells11 ] , which is constructed from the laterally averaged 2d data at each radius , is misleading by the fact that this preshock material appears to be located behind the angle - averaged shock radius ( at post - bounce times @xmath95ms ) .",

    "again , as in the 15@xmath0 explosion model , this suggests the presence of ongoing accretion of gas through the gain layer to the neutron star ( which can also be concluded from the continued contraction of mass shells in this region in fig .",

    "neutrino - heating rate has reached a pronounced peak of about @xmath97erg@xmath1s@xmath24 at @xmath98ms , it makes a rapid drop to around @xmath99erg@xmath1s@xmath24 .",
    "this decline is a consequence of the decay of the neutrino luminosities at the time when the mass infall rate onto the shock and the neutron star decreases .",
    "the decrease occurs when the steep negative density gradient ( and positive entropy step ) near the composition interface between the silicon layer and the oxygen - enriched si - layer of the progenitor star ( near 1.3@xmath0 ) arrives at the shock ( at @xmath100ms after bounce ) . nevertheless , the heating timescale shrinks essentially monotonically , which points to an evolution of the matter in the gain layer towards an unbound state , i.e. , the absolute value of the total gas energy in the numerator of eq .",

    "( 2 ) also then the energy of the explosion grows only gradually and initially roughly linearly with a rate of some 10@xmath103erg per 100@xmath1ms .",
    "during this phase ongoing accretion transports fresh gas towards the gain radius , where a part of the gas absorbs energy from neutrinos and begins to rise again , while the rest of the accreted gas is advected into the cooling layer below the gain radius and is added into the forming neutron star .",
    "( 3 ) after some time the downdrafts of accreted matter may be quenched and the inflow of gas towards regions near the gain radius may stop .",
    "nevertheless , more neutrino - heated gas is ejected in the neutrino - driven wind that sheds off matter from the surface layer of the nascent neutron star . during this phase the increase of the explosion energy levels off , but still a significant fraction of the final energy",
    "may be added ( though with a much lower rate ) over timescales of several more seconds .",
    "the corresponding wind power is a very sensitive function of the neutrino emission properties ( i.e. , of the time - dependent luminosities and mean energies of the radiated neutrinos ) and of the neutron star mass and radius .",
    "some @xmath104erg , in optimistic estimates even more than @xmath105erg , of energy might be pumped into the supernova this way after the onset of the blast ( see burrows & goshy 1993 ; qian & woosley 1996 ; thompson , burrows , & meyer 2001 ) .",
    "( 4 ) the total energy injected at the explosion center has to be corrected for the negative total energy of the gravitationally bound outer stellar shells , which are going to be swept out in the blast instead of falling back to the neutron star .",

    "gets heated by neutrinos ( an effect that is accounted for in the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expenergy ] ) ) , however , such nucleon recombination does _ not _ necessarily mean a gain in the energy budget .",
    "the gas swept up by the shock and falling inward to the neutron star in downflows is initially composed of nuclei ( iron , silicon , or oxygen , depending on the location of the shock , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rotmod1 ] ) .",
    "compressional heating within the shock and in the downflows ( or ultimately energy deposition by neutrinos ) produces such high temperatures that the nuclei get disintegrated , which consumes a fair amount of dissociation energy .",
    "this energy can subsequently be recovered in the fraction of the matter that reexpands and gets blown out again .",
    "different from the energy input by neutrinos , the recombination of nucleons , however , yields a net energy gain only when the nucleon recombination leads to a state with higher nuclear binding energy per baryon .",
    "this means that the net gain of energy by nuclear processes in the accreted material can at most be equal to the difference in the binding energy of oxygen or silicon ( initially present in the accretion flow ) compared to iron - group elements ( the most strongly bound nuclei ) , which is much smaller than the complete recombination energy of free nucleons to nuclei .",
    "for both components of the ejecta , however , for the neutrino - driven wind material as well as accreted and reexpanding matter , nuclear processes are unlikely to be the main source of the energy excess ( and thus of the explosion energy ) that the matter carries outward in the supernova blast .",
    "on the one hand , gas residing in the gain layer before the explosion sets in as well as matter ablated from the neutron star surface in the later neutrino - wind phase is initially at rest in the strong gravitational field very close to the neutron star and has a largely negative total energy ( @xmath124(@xmath125mev / nucleon ) or more ) .",
    "the energy liberated by the recombination of free nucleons to nuclei in this matter , though large ( @xmath5178.8@xmath1mev per nuclen ) , can typically only assist the revival of the stalled shock but can not account for all the energy needed to make this matter gravitationally unbound .",
    "neutrino energy deposition is also needed to overcome the gravitational binding and to produce the positive energy of the ejecta at infinity . on the other hand , gas that is accreted from large distances , channelled through the neutrino - heating region , and",
    "then reexpanding outward right away is initially gravitationally only weakly bound ( its total specific energy is typically only of the order of @xmath126mev per nucleon ) .",
    "a change of the nuclear composition in this matter by assembling heavier nuclei from lighter ones can release only a relatively small amount of energy ( also of the order of 12@xmath1mev per nucleon ) and can bring the gas at most to a gravitationally marginally unbound energy level .",
    "so again the ultimate energy excess that drives the supernova explosion has to come from another source .",
    "neutrino energy deposition plays this dominant role in our simulations .    in this context",
    "it is crucial to answer the question how long accretion can continue and how long efficient energy input by neutrinos according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : exprate ] ) can therefore apply .",
    "the time when accretion ends can be deduced in a crude way from the requirement that at this moment the outgoing shock ( with velocity @xmath127 and postshock velocity @xmath128 in the observer frame ) must accelerate the postshock matter to escape velocity .",
    "the corresponding radius is therefore determined by @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the enclosed mass normalized to 1.5@xmath0 , @xmath131 the shock velocity in @xmath132cm@xmath1s@xmath24 , and the postshock velocity @xmath128 was determined from the preshock velocity @xmath134 and the shock velocity @xmath127 by the first shock - jump condition as @xmath135 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 . for the duration of the accretion phase after the onset of outward shock expansion we therefore get : @xmath138 this means that accretion can easily continue for half a second or even longer , if the shock expands slowly in the beginning .",
    "this is confirmed by the supernova simulations of scheck et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in some of which accretion was observed to still go on significantly longer than one second after the explosion had started .",
    "the explosion energy is therefore not determined by the conditions just at the moment when the outward shock acceleration begins or when the shock is in its early stage of expansion .",
    "for this reason it is impossible to conclude from our simulations that the 11.2@xmath0 and 15@xmath0 explosions will finally be weak or strong . in the multi - dimensional environment of the supernova core with accretion and shock expansion being simultaneously present",

    "an inspection of the different energies that characterize the energetic conditions in the gain layer reveals that the kinetic energy , in particular the part that is associated with the radial velocity component , begins to deviate between the two models around the time when their evolution starts to diverge ( upper left panel of fig .",

    "other energies as well as the neutrino - heating rate do not show any peculiar differences .",
    "while the divergence of the internal energies is likely to be a consequence of the stronger shock expansion in model  m15ls - rot , which leads to growth of the mass in the gain layer , the difference of the radial kinetic energy could be causal for the discrepant later evolution of both simulations .",
    "unfortunately , because of the complex interdependence of different effects ( hydrodynamics , gravity , neutrino physics ) we are not able to unambiguously track down the origin of this energy difference and to clarify whether it is really the reason or also just the result of the evolution that separates at about 570@xmath1ms .    in any case , however , it shows that in the given situation the later development of models  m15ls - rot and m15ls - rot - hr seems to be extremely sensitive to relatively small effects .",

    "we repeat and stress here , however , that a variety of diagnostic parameters like the growing shock radius and sasi activity as well as the large value of the ratio of advection to heating timescale , exhibit an overall trend that appears very favorable for an upcoming explosion also in the case of model  m15ls - rot - hr . unfortunately , without being able to run this model ( and any of the other 15@xmath0 simulations , in particular with high resolution ) for a sufficiently long post - bounce time  which is presently prevented by the limited computer resources available to us  we have no convincing support for this reasoning .",
    "model  m15ls - rot9 was computed with a somewhat weaker effective relativistic gravitational potential than our standard model  m15ls - rot ( case  a of marek et al .",

    "this suggests that rotation does not play an essential role for the evolution of model  m15ls - rot towards runaway .",
    "in fact , with respect to the overall long - time behavior , rotation seems to just compensate much of the influence of the stronger gravitational potential used in model  m15ls - rot .    the weaker gravity in model  m15ls - rot9 relative to model  m15ls - rot allows the shock to move farther out by @xmath5120@xmath1 km on average during the first 300@xmath1ms after bounce ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shockpositions ] ) . since also",
    "the infall velocity in the preshock region is lower due to the reduced gravitational acceleration , the advection timescale is significantly longer in model  m15ls - rot9 . at the same time , the accretion luminosities of neutrinos in model  m15ls - rot9 , in which the neutron star is less compact and less hot , are significantly smaller ( fig .",

    "one might therefore conclude that rotation as considered in our models  m15ls - rot and m15ls - rot9 does not improve the conditions for an explosive runaway compared to nonrotating models in which low sasi modes are able to develop ( this comparison turns out to be reversed , if such modes are suppressed in the nonrotating case by a constraining choice of the grid setup ; see fig .  15 in buras et al .",

    "the effect grows strongly with higher angular momentum of the accreted matter . in combination with the fact that rotationally deformed neutron stars produce enhanced luminosities and/or higher mean energies for neutrinos radiated in the polar direction ( janka & mnchmeyer 1989a , b ; kotake et al .",
    "2003 ) , this might imply more optimistic conditions at very late postbounce times when material with higher angular momentum from larger initial radii arrives at the accretion shock .      the comparison of models  m15ls-2d and m15hw-2d yields information about the influence of the neutron star eos , which determines many aspects of the post - bounce evolution , most importantly the compactness of the nascent neutron star and the properties of the radiated neutrinos .",
    "the hw - eos used in model  m15hw-2d is clearly stiffer and the neutron star consequently less compact ( see figs .  [ fig:1dresults ] and [ fig : shockpositions ] ) .",

    "[ fig : timescales ] ) .",
    "while in the 1d simulation with the hw - eos the shock position follows the behavior of the neutron star radius and expands to a larger distance from the center than in the 1d model with the ls - eos ( see fig .",

    "the sloshing of the shock in model  m15hw-2d reaches a clearly smaller amplitude than in model  m15ls-2d during most phases of the computed @xmath51400@xmath1ms of post - bounce evolution .",
    "this is particularly obvious between 200 and 300@xmath1ms after bounce and points to a significantly lower strength of the sasi activity ( for more details , see marek , janka , & mller 2008 ) .",
    "an inspection of the kinetic energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] ( upper left panel ) supports this conjecture , and a quantitative evaluation reveals that the @xmath52 and @xmath53 sasi modes reach only 2030% of the power they have in model  m15ls-2d .",
    "in fact , the sasi activity in model  m15hw-2d grows considerably more slowly and the low - mode power is orders of magnitude smaller than in model  m15ls-2d until nearly 200@xmath1ms after bounce ( see also marek et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "this suggests that the compactness of the forming neutron star has a very strong influence on the growth and strength of the sasi and of convective activity in the gain layer , either directly by the conversion of gravitational binding energy to kinetic and internal energy in the accretion flow , or indirectly via the effects of larger luminosities and mean energies of the neutrinos radiated during the period of mass accretion and thus stronger neutrino heating . a more rapidly contracting and more compact neutron star is obviously more favorable in this context .",
    "such a behavior could have different reasons , for example a softening of the eos in the interior of the nascent neutron star as a consequence of a microphysical phase transition that is triggered by evolutionary changes ( gravitational settling , neutronization , heating due to compression and conversion of electron degeneracy energy to thermal energy ) in the star .",
    "we therefore emphasize that more favorable conditions for an explosion during the post - bounce accretion phase of the forming neutron star neither require a lower value of the incompressibility modulus of the eos for nearly symmetric matter at saturation density , nor are they directly linked to the eos properties around bounce , which affect the shock formation and prompt shock propagation but not necessarily the long - time evolution of the accretion shock .",
    "the gradual growth of relevant parameters ( heating rate , timescale ratio , kinetic energy in the gain layer , etc . ) towards the end of the computed evolution appears promising for the possibility of an explosion in model  m15ls-2d at later times : many properties , of this model near the termination of the run , for example the neutrino luminosities and neutrino - heating quantities , are very similar to those of our explosion model m15ls - rot at the same time .",
    "initially model  m15hw-2d looks less optimistic than model  m15ls-2d , but there are indications that some quantities in model  m15hw-2d might reverse their trends in the long run .",
    "for example the shock radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shockpositions ] ) , the kinetic energy in the gain layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] ) , the sasi power , and the low - mode shock deformation ( fig .  [ fig : modes ] ) exhibit a strong rise after @xmath51300@xmath1ms , which leads to an increase of the advection timescale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timescales ] ) and also of the heating in the gain layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : heating ] ) .",
    "this improvement could be a consequence of the growing compactness of the nascent neutron star .",
    "both simulations , model  m15hw-2d and model  m15ls-2d , however , could not yet be carried on for sufficiently long evolution periods after bounce to see which differences the two employed nuclear eoss might ultimately could make for an explosion at even later times .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : rotneutrinos1 ] and [ fig : rotneutrinos2 ] we present some results on the neutrino emission of our exploding model  m15ls - rot . in spite of the deeper effective gravitational potential used in this simulation ( case  r of marek et al .",
    "2006 ) , the luminosities and mean energies of the radiated neutrinos at late times after bounce ( @xmath68ms ) are slightly lower than those in model  m15ls-1d .",
    "this is again the influence of rotation , which compensates some of the consequences of the stronger gravity in model  m15ls - rot , an effect that we have already discussed in the context of comparing models  m15ls - rot and m15ls-2d , whose neutrino luminosities become very similar after 200@xmath1ms of post - bounce evolution ( see lower panel in fig .

    "the mean energies of the neutrinos radiated from model  m15ls - rot ( averaged over all observer directions relative to the rotation axis ) , however , do not exhibit the crossing of @xmath143 and @xmath144 seen in the 1d calculations , although both mean energies get very close ( compare the middle panel of fig .",

    "this , as well as the trough - like shape of the curves ( which is also present in the muon and tau neutrino flux densities , see upper left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : rotneutrinos2 ] ) , is a consequence of the rotational deformation of the neutrinospheric region as visible in the lower two plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : rotneutrinos2 ] .",
    "the superimposed short - wavelength variations of the average radiated energies and of the neutrino fluxes are caused by local downdrafts of accreted matter near the poles and close to the equatorial plane .",

    "[ fig : rotneutrinos2 ] . near the poles , where the downdrafts penetrate deep inward and become very hot ,",
    "neutrinos of all flavors are produced in the tips of these flow structures , whereas the lower points of equatorial downflows emit only @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( this explains the absence of a local maximum of the muon and tau neutrino flux density around the equator ) .    because of rotation , the density and temperature gradients at the poles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rotneutrinos2 ] , bottom right ) are much steeper and the radial positions of all neutrinospheres there are extremely close together .",
    "most importantly , the region where the dominant part of the flux is generated before the flux density gets diluted due to scattering losses and the growing distance from the source , is significantly below the energy - averaged neutrinosphere for muon and tau neutrinos ( see the yellow areas in the right half of the lower left plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : rotneutrinos2 ] ) .",
    "this means that before the @xmath147 and @xmath148 reach their neutrinosphere , they have to diffuse through an extended scattering atmosphere that acts like a high - energy filter , i.e. , that is inefficient in producing more of these neutrinos , but in which energy transfers in neutrino - nucleon and neutrino - electron scatterings down - grade high - energy neutrinos in energy space and reduce the energy flux of heavy - lepton neutrinos ( raffelt 2001 ; keil et al .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in contrast to heavy - lepton neutrinos are abundantly absorbed and emitted by charged - current @xmath13-processes and thus are more strongly created in an extended but cooler and less dense accretion layer ( visible , for example , also by a significantly more extended neutrinospheres at low latitudes ) .",
    "both effects in combination are responsible for the convergence or even inversion of the mean energies of the radiated @xmath3 and @xmath48 in equator - near regions ( for a discussion of this phenomenon in the context of the nonrotating 2d models , see marek et al .",
    "close to the poles the extreme steepness of the density gradient and the additional enhancement of the neutrinospheric fluxes of muon and tau neutrinos and antineutrinos by convection below the neutrinospheres ( see next paragraph ) counteract such a strong filter effect of a scattering atmosphere .",
    "the 1d models ( cf .  sect .",
    "[ sec:1dmodels ] ) define a case that is more similar to the equatorial regions of the rotating model : although the mass infall rate to the nascent neutron star drops strongly after the first @xmath51200@xmath1ms of massive post - bounce accretion , the energysphere of muon and tau neutrinos is considerably below the neutrinosphere and the density decline below the accretion atmosphere is sufficiently gradual to establish a thick layer of frequent neutrino scatterings between the energysphere and the neutrinosphere of heavy - lepton neutrinos .    finally , we point out that the region of convective activity inside the nascent neutron star can be discerned in the lower left plot of fig .  [",

    "a pattern of green and red stripes indicates elongated convective cells that are oriented parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "this is typical of a situation in which convection is constrained by the presence of angular momentum gradients ( see the discussion in buras et al .",
    "the cell structure becomes visible in this image , because ledoux convection in the newly formed neutron star is driven by negative lepton number gradients and is therefore associated with variations of the neutron - to - proton ratio .",
    "due to the short @xmath13-equilibration timescale in the optically thick regime , such variations are tightly linked to differences in the electron neutrino density as well as flux density . in the right half of the lower left image of fig .",

    "the very late explosions in the runs of burrows et al .  were powered by the acoustic flux that was sent by large - amplitude vibrations of the neutron star into the medium surrounding the compact remnant . on travelling outward , the pressure waves steepened into shocks and dissipated their energy in the medium behind the supernova shock , thus creating the thermal energy that provided the pressure for the shock acceleration .",

    "slightly larger , but still very small is the displacement caused by the low - frequency variations : the center of mass of the whole gas wobbles around the grid center with an amplitude of usually less than 50 meters , which is much smaller than the radius of our innermost grid cell ( 300 meters ) .",
    "the separation of the center of mass from the grid center grows larger only when the outward shock expansion becomes very strong and the postshock layer gets inflated with a pronounced global deformation at @xmath67ms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] ) . a clear trend in one direction seems to be established towards the end of the computational run ( with a final displacement , however , that is still only insignificantly bigger than the first radial grid zone ) as a consequence of the clear dipolar asymmetry of the accelerating postshock gas , which attains more momentum in the southern hemisphere ( bottom right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] ) .",
    "we observe a very similar behavior in the case of our 11.2@xmath0 explosion model , where the @xmath9-momentum in the northern hemisphere dominates when the simulation is terminated .",
    "the momentum asymmetry of the supernova gas could ultimately imply a sizable recoil of the neutron star in the opposite direction , which should drive the neutron star away from the coordinate center ( possibly leading to numerical problems ) , but our simulations are not carried on long enough to be conclusive . in model",

    "a significant drift of the neutron star away from the origin of the grid is likely to lead to numerical problems , because the gravity solver as well as the treatment of the neutrino transport are written for a centrally condensed mass in a polar coordinate grid .",
    "until the end of our simulations , however , neither this problem nor violation of momentum conservation are a serious concern .    another conceivable restriction of our simulations might be connected to our use of a relativistic monopole potential , whose dominant contribution to the gravitational potential of the neutron star prohibits an accurate response of the gravitational field to the nonradial asymmetry of the mass distribution caused by the sasi oscillations , convective mass motions , and gravity waves .",
    "one should note here , however , that we still have included the higher multipoles of the gravitational potential in their newtonian form , and thus our treatment of the gravitational effects is certainly much less constraining and much less approximative than the so - called cowling approximation .",

    "if they were excited ( e.g.  hydrodynamically by pressure variations around the neutron star surface due to anisotropic accretion flows ) , we artificially instigated a large dipole g - mode by imposing an @xmath203 perturbation ( i.e. , we assumed one radial node ) of the @xmath9-component of the velocity field at a time late after bounce ( alternatively , we also tested an @xmath204 mode with two radial nodes , obtaining similar results ) .",
    "the velocity field was imposed with a constant absolute value on the matter within a radius of 50@xmath1 km .",

    "the central 1d region , though small , might brake the motion because there might be friction and dissipative losses caused in the 2d flow around the central 1d core .",
    "this possibility , however , seems to be ruled out for the core sizes chosen and the numerical resolution employed , because test runs with a core radius of 0.8@xmath1 km instead of 1.7@xmath1 km and with a full 2d treatment ( i.e. , no 1d core and thus painfully tiny computational timesteps ) show the same frequency , amplitude , and damping behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gmodetests ] , left lower panel ) .",
    "only when the radius of the central 1d core is increased to @xmath513@xmath1 km we can observe a slightly faster damping and a gradually decreasing oscillation frequency .",
    "another possible reason for the initial damping is the reconfiguration of the mode pattern due to the fact that the imposed perturbation does not correspond to an eigenfunction .",
    "this means that oscillation energy will be redistributed within several pulsation periods and therefore amplitude damping is observed in some regions while the amplitudes in other regions increase .",
    "we find damping in the whole volume of the neutron star up to a radius of @xmath5130@xmath1 km , so that the motion outside should be amplified .",

    "fig : gmodetests ] , left panel ) .",
    "yet another reason for the observed damping , probably enhanced by the just mentioned growth of the g - mode amplitude near the neutron star surface , is the acoustic energy flux that is sent by the moving neutron star into its surrounding medium . assuming that this ultimately is the most efficient channel for energy loss of the ringing neutron star",
    ", we can obtain an upper limit for the corresponding rate of energy outflow . since roughly 75% of the initial mode energy",

    "similar to the explosion obtained for the 11.2@xmath0 star , the delayed shock revival by neutrino heating in the 15@xmath0 model was fostered and enabled by the presence of a strong , low - mode sasi oscillations of the postshock layer star was obtained in a simulation in which we had imposed angular momentum on the progenitor model , our comparion with the other simulations for this progenitor suggests that the presence of rotation was not essential for the development of the explosion ( see sects .",

    "2008 ) .",
    "the sasi has two crucial consequences , which are favorable for the possibility of neutrino - driven explosions . on the one hand , the violent sloshing motions of the postshock layer with fast expansion and contraction phases of the shock",
    "create steep entropy gradients in the postshock flow , which lead to powerful secondary convection and thus efficient overturn of the gas in the gain region ( for a detailed discussion , see scheck et al .",
    "2008 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the sasi also pushes the shock to a larger average radius .",
    "this reduces the mean accretion velocity in the gain layer ( because the velocity in the infall region ahead of the shock drops inversely with the square root of the shock radius ) and thus increases the advection timescale of gas from the shock to the gain radius .",
    "the accreted matter is therefore exposed to neutrino heating for a longer time , a fact that is reflected by a significant increase of the critical ratio of the advection timescale to the neutrino - heating timescale .",
    "a strong sasi activity has the consequence that this timescale ratio comes much closer to the value of unity , signaling favorable conditions for a neutrino - driven explosion .",
    "the combination of these effects indeed turned out to drive the 15@xmath0 model ( specifically our model m15ls - rot ) towards a runaway instability at about 600@xmath1ms after core bounce , while for the 11.2@xmath0 star this happened roughly 200@xmath1ms after bounce .    unfortunately , due to the considerable demand of computer time with the high numerical resolution needed for converged results , we were so far not able to continue our simulations to the phase where the blast is fully developed and the explosion energy can be determined from our computations",
    "however , several factors are indicators that the 15@xmath0 model m15ls - rot considered here just like the investigated 11.2@xmath0 model is in the process of undergoing the transition from collapse to successful outburst .",
    "this is suggested not only by the rapidly accelerating expansion of the shock radius near the end of the simulations and by the fact that the critical timescale ratio exceeds unity permanently with rapidly growing value .",
    "it is also suggested by a continuous trend of increasing energy in the gain layer . before model m15ls - rot",
    "was stopped , a significant and growing gas mass in the gain layer had obtained a positive specific energy and was thus ready to become gravitationally unbound and to promote further outward propagation of the shock against the gravitational pull of the neutron star .",
    "the mean shock radius has already reached about 600@xmath1 km .",
    "this is sufficiently large for the temperature in the postshock ejecta to be so low that considerable nucleon recombination to @xmath18-particles has set in and for the gas swept up by the shock to be so cool that heavy nuclei do not experience complete dissociation any longer .",
    "the release of nuclear binding energy and the reduction of dissociation energy allow for a higher pressure behind the shock and support the shock expansion .",
    "last but not least , the shock has entered the progenitor layer ( at about 500@xmath1 km ) where silicon is not yet burned to iron , and its most extended parts reach the shell where oxygen is still unburned ( at @xmath51700@xmath1 km ) . according to bruenn",
    "et al .  ( 2006 ) and mezzacappa et al .  (",

    "the neutron star can proceed at the same time as shock acceleration sets in due to the expansion of rising , neutrino - heated , buoyant gas .",

    "the ongoing accretion continuously channels fresh material , which is swept up by the shock , to the region near the gain radius , where neutrino heating is strongest .",
    "roughly half of the gas penetrates to the cooling layer below the gain radius and ultimately settles onto the neutron star , the other half absorbs with high efficiency energy from the neutrinos radiated by the neutron star .",
    "this gas turns around and rises again , driven by buoyancy forces , and contributes to the energy of the explosion .",
    "our estimates show ( and hydrodynamic simulations by scheck et al .",
    "2006 have demonstated ) that simultaneous accretion and shock acceleration can go on for many hundred milliseconds and therefore the final explosion energy can only be determined by computations that cover a much longer time evolution than we were able to follow in our current simulations .",
    "our analytic considerations , based on the situation at the beginning of the explosion , reveal that the 11.2@xmath0 model can be expected to develop an explosion energy of several @xmath104erg , while due to the higher mass accretion rate the canonical value of @xmath105erg is well in reach of the considered 15@xmath0 star .",
    "the final explosion energy should increase sensitively when the initial expansion of the shock is relatively slow and when the progenitor maintains an appreciable mass accretion rate for a longer time .    because the onset of the discussed sasi - supported neutrino - driven explosions for 11.2 and 15@xmath0 stars is considerably delayed , the neutrino - heated gas mass in the gain layer at the time when the blast takes off is fairly low and therefore a powerful gas ejection has to rely on a longer lasting phase of simultaneous accretion and outflow .",
    "the possibility of such stable accretion with downflows from one ( or more ) direction(s ) and gas outflow in the other direction(s ) was indeed seen in the simulations of scheck et al .",
    "the significance of this generically multi - dimensional phenomenon in powering the explosion to completion and in achieving the necessary energies contradicts the concept of supernovae being energized by a spherically symmetric neutrino - driven wind as suggested by burrows & goshy ( 1993 ) .",
    "this has been realized recently also by burrows et al .  and was advocated by them in the context of the acoustic explosion mechanism ( burrows et al .",

    "the strong shock acceleration , which we found to begin about 200@xmath1ms after bounce in the 11.2@xmath0 progenitor and at 600@xmath1ms after bounce in the investigated 15@xmath0 model , is associated with a large dipolar deformation of the shock .",
    "this is a clear indication for the dominance of the lowest nonradial sasi mode at the onset of the runaway .",

    "this is a consequence on the one hand of a more rapid growth of low sasi modes , amplified by the release of gravitational binding energy , and on the other hand of higher luminosities and mean energies of the emitted neutrinos during the accretion phase and correspondingly stronger neutrino heating in the gain layer .",
    "the latter also supports the development of violent sasi and convective activity in the postshock region .",
    "we stress that the eos properties that lead to a faster compactification of the nascent neutron star during its post - bounce accretion do not need to be linked to the eos characteristics at core bounce or to the value of the incompressibility modulus of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density .",
    "the evolutionary changes in the interior of the remnant could also trigger a softening of the eos by a reduction of the adiabatic index , e.g. , as a result of a phase transition .",
    "rotation , in contrast , can be diagnosed to have the opposite effect .",
    "although centrifugal support leads to a larger average shock radius , a longer advection timescale of the matter falling through the gain layer , and a reduced binding energy of accreted matter , these helpful effects are more than compensated by lower luminosities and mean energies of the neutrinos radiated by the significantly more extended and cooler rotating proto - neutron star .",
    "the overall neutrino heating and heating efficiency found in rotating models is considerably lower and the neutrino heating timescale in the gain layer correspondingly longer .",
    "the critical ratio of advection timescale to heating timescale therefore signals less favorable conditions for an explosion in comparison to a nonrotating model with otherwise the same physics . this pessimistic judgement of the role of rotation is opposed by the assessment of yamasaki & yamada ( 2005 ) , who found by linear analysis that sufficiently rapid rotation leads to a reduced critical neutrino luminosity for shock revival in the polar direction .",
    "simulations for longer postbounce times are needed to obtain conclusive information about this possibility .",

    "they diagnosed that effective energy release by oxygen burning in the immediate vicinity of the shock , which in their case happens only with the alpha network , assists the explosion , in particular in case of a weak shock .",
    "their papers do not provide the information that would allow us to conduct a detailed comparison of the composition evolution in their simulations and in ours .",
    "however , we emphasise that although we do not use a nuclear reaction network , we still follow composition changes in the non - nse regime by converting oxygen to silicon and silicon to iron when the corresponding burning temperatures are reached due to compressional ( or shock ) heating in the infalling stellar layers . in our calculations for the 11.2@xmath0 and 15@xmath0 progenitors",
    "a variety of important indicators signal the onset of the blast and strong outward shock acceleration already long before the accretion shock has reached the inner boundary of the oxygen - rich layer .",
    "this , of course , does not mean that oxygen burning in the collapsing layers has no bearing on the possibility of an explosion , but it means that the inauguration of the blast is not correlated with oxygen combustion happening at the shock .",
    "independent of whether a more accurate network treatment of nuclear reactions and of the transition to nse instead of our simplified description can make a difference for the shock propagation or not , the simulations by bruenn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mezzacappa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that any such improvement is likely not to disfavor explosions of the investigated stars . in this sense",
    "the fundamental agreement of the outcome of these different simulations , in spite of various differences in numerical aspects and input physics , may be considered as very encouraging .",
    "certainly , our current simulations can only be suggestive for how neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities in collapsing stellar cores can collaborate to initiate the supernova explosion .",
    "the simulations must be continued to later times for determining the explosion properties , and definitely more calculations are needed to obtain a clear understanding how the shock revival depends on the core structure of the progenitor stars and on the physics that plays a role in the supernova core , e.g. , the neutrino opacities , equation of state , rotation , the depth of the gravitational potential , and also stochastic elements like chaotic fluctuations of the sasi strength in the nonlinear regime .",
    "also the influence of the numerical resolution has to be more closely studied .",
    "our simulations can not assess all the interesting questions involved .",
    "the results as presented here should only be seen as an indication that the neutrino - driven mechanism is a viable possibility for driving supernova explosions of progenitor stars significantly more massive than 10@xmath0 .",
    "the positive trend towards a sasi - supported , neutrino - driven runaway late after bounce might be linked to a ( relatively ) soft equation of state for neutron star matter , like the eos of lattimer & swesty ( 1991 ) used by us .",
    "our set of calculations for the considered 15@xmath0 star , although including also a model with a significantly stiffer nuclear eos , does not provide an answer to the question how robust the success of the sasi - supported neutrino - heating mechanism is to variations of such an important physics ingredient .",
    "systematic long - time simulations for different nuclear equations of state are needed to explore the differences at times later than covered by our present calculations .",
    "also the exact moment when the explosion sets in can well be sensitive to various uncertain aspects like the amount of rotation in the stellar core , the possible influence of amplifying magnetic fields , unsettled details of the subnuclear equation of state and of neutrino - matter interactions , neutrino oscillations , the missing treatment of lateral neutrino fluxes in our simulations , and the approximative description of the effects of relativistic gravity .",
    "even stochastical variations at some fairly low energy level ( @xmath211erg in the gain layer ) seem to be sufficient to foster an explosion at an earlier time .",
    "simulations in full relativity are certainly desirable , in particular for stellar core collapse with rotation , because in this case the optimal choice of the effective gravitational potential is not obvious ( see marek et al .",
    "moreover , supernova modeling in three spatial dimensions must be the ultimate goal , because the growth rate and properties of the hydrodynamic instabilities in 3d must be expected to differ from the axially symmetric 2d case , and new degrees of freedom may play a non - negligible and potentially helpful role , for example spiral waves ( @xmath212 modes ) and triaxial instabilities ( see , e.g. , blondin & mezzacappa 2007 , ott et al .",
    "2007 , yamasaki & foglizzo 2007 , iwakami et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in the light of our present results ,",
    "supernova explosions appear to be an _ accretion instability _ rather than an aspherical wind as described by burrows et al .",
    "( 2007c ) .",
    "the sasi and convective instabilities , and in particular the simultaneous presence of accretion and outflow of neutrino - heated gas , which drives the shock expansion , are crucial ingredients of the explosions described in this paper and constitute the explosions as a generically multi - dimensional phenomenon .",
    "the gas outflow during the main phase of shock revival and the build - up of the explosion energy are fed by neutrino - heated , accreted gas .",
    "only much later , after the accretion has ceased , does the gain radius retreat to the neutron star surface and the cooling layer between neutrinosphere and gain radius shrinks to a very narrow region or disappears completely .",
    "this marks the onset of the neutrino - driven baryonic wind phase , in which the dilute gas outflow from the nascent neutron star is determined solely by the conditions at the surface of the hot , compact remnant and not by the ( accretion ) properties of the dying star .",

    "<S> we present two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core collapse and develop the framework for a detailed analysis of the energetic aspects of neutrino - powered supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm that the neutrino - heating mechanism remains a viable explanation of the explosion of a wider mass range of supernova progenitors with iron cores , but the explosion sets in later and develops differently than thought so far . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were performed with an energy - dependent treatment of the neutrino transport based on the `` ray - by - ray plus '' approximation , in which the neutrino number , energy , and momentum equations are closed with a variable eddington factor obtained by iteratively solving a model boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the evolution of a 15@xmath0 progenitor and provide evidence that shock revival and an explosion are initiated at about 600@xmath1ms after core bounce , powered by neutrino energy deposition . </S>",
    "<S> this is significantly later than previously found for an 11.2@xmath0 star , for which we also present a continuation of the explosion model published by buras et al . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the blast is fostered in both cases by the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) . </S>",
    "<S> this instability exhibits highest growth rates for the dipole and quadrupole modes , which lead to large - amplitude bipolar shock oscillations and push the shock to larger radii , thus increasing the time accreted matter is exposed to neutrino heating in the gain layer . as a consequence , also convective overturn behind the shock is strengthened , which otherwise is suppressed or damped because of the small shock stagnation radius . </S>",
    "<S> when the explosion sets in , the shock reveals a pronounced global deformation with a dominant dipolar component . in both the 11.2@xmath0 and 15@xmath0 explosions long - lasting equatorial downflows supply the gain layer with fresh gas , </S>",
    "<S> of which a sizable fraction is heated by neutrinos and leads to the build - up of the explosion energy of the ejecta over possibly hundreds of milliseconds . a `` soft '' nuclear equation of state that causes a rapid contraction and a smaller radius of the forming neutron star and thus a fast release of gravitational binding energy , seems to be more favorable for the development of an explosion . </S>",
    "<S> rotation has the opposite effect because in the long run it leads to a more extended and cooler neutron star and thus lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies and overall less neutrino heating . </S>",
    "<S> neutron star g - mode oscillations , although we see their presence , and the acoustic mechanism play no important role in our simulations . </S>",
    "<S> while numerical tests show that our code is well able to follow also large - amplitude core g - modes if they are instigated , the amplitude of such oscillations remains small in our supernova runs and the acoustic energy flux injected by the ringing neutron star is minuscule compared to the neutrino energy deposition . </S>"
