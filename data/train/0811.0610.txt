    "two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms may be viewed as the mother of all other forms of carbon .",
    "its crucial electronic property , which arises as a consequence of the absence of the inversion symmetry around the lattice site , is that the usual fermi surface is reduced to just two points .",
    "the electronic dispersion may be linearized around these two points , after which it becomes isotropic and dependent on the single dimensionful parameter , fermi velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the pseudo - relativistic nature of the electronic motion in graphene has since its synthesis placed this material at the center stage of condensed matter physics .",
    "many qualitatively novel phenomena that take , or may take place in such a system of `` dirac '' electrons are actively discussed in the rapidly growing literature on the subject .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we discuss the low - energy theory and the metal - insulator quantum phase transitions of the _ interacting _ dirac electrons on the honeycomb lattice , building upon and expanding significantly the earlier work by one of us .",
    "@xcite in the first approximation , _ all _ weak interactions of dirac electrons in graphene may be neglected at half filling , when the fermi surface consists of the dirac points .",
    "this is because short - range interactions are represented by local terms which are quartic in the electron fields , which makes them irrelevant near the non - interacting fixed point by power counting .",
    "the same conclusion turns out to apply to the long - range tail of the coulomb interaction , which remains unscreened in graphene , although only marginally so .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , if strong enough , the same interactions would turn graphene into a gapped mott insulator . as an example , at a strong on - site repulsion the system is likely to be the usual nel antiferromagnet .",
    "@xcite it is not _ a priori _ clear on which side of this metal - insulator transition graphene should be . with the standard estimate for the nearest - neighbor hopping in graphene of @xmath5 and the hubbard interaction of @xmath6 , it seems that the system is below yet not too far from the critical point estimated to be at @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite if sufficiently weak , the electron - electron interactions only provide corrections to scaling of various quantities , which ultimately vanish at low temperatures or frequencies . at , what is probably a more realistic , an intermediate strength , the flow of interactions and the concomitant low - energy behavior may be influenced by the existence of metal - insulator critical points .",
    "it is possible that some of the consequences of such interaction - dominated physics have already been observed in the quantization of the hall conductance at filling factors zero and one .",
    "@xcite as we argued elsewhere , the anomalously large value of the minimal conductivity in graphene @xcite may be yet another consequence of the coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "@xcite    the above discussion raises some basic questions .",
    "what is the minimal description of interacting electrons in graphene at `` low '' energies ?",
    "what is the symmetry of the continuum interacting theory , and how does it constrain the number of coupling constants ?",
    "what kinds of order may be expected at strong coupling , and what is the nature of the metal - insulator quantum phase transition ? in this paper we address these and related issues . in the rest of the introduction",
    "we give a preview of our main results .    the simplest prototypical system that exhibits",
    "the physics of interacting dirac fermions which we seek to understand is the collection of spinless electrons interacting via short - range interactions , at half - filling . for present purposes an interaction",
    "may be considered as `` short - ranged '' if its fourier transform at the vanishing wavevector is finite .",
    "@xcite the least irrelevant quartic terms one can add to the non - interacting dirac lagrangian will then be local in space - time , and of course quartic in terms of the four - component dirac fields that describe the electronic modes near the two inequivalent dirac points at wavevectors @xmath8 at the edges of the brillouin zone .",
    "the most general local quartic term in the lagrangian would be of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are four - dimensional hermitian matrices .",
    "the symmetry alone , however , immediately drastically reduces the number of independent couplings from the apparent @xmath12 to just fifteen .",
    "although the point group of the honeycomb lattice is @xmath13 , the exact spatial discrete symmetry of the lagrangian is only the _ dihedral group _",
    "@xmath1 , or the _ vierergruppe _ , which consists of the reflections through the two coordinate axis shown in fig . 1 , and the inversion through the origin .",
    "such a small symmetry results from the very choice of two inequivalent dirac points out of six corners of the brillouin zone , which reduces the symmetry to the simple exchange of the two sublattices ( reflection around a axis ) , the exchange of dirac points ( reflection around b axis ) , and their product ( the inversion through the origin ) .",
    "@xmath1 , the time - reversal , and the translational invariance are shown to leave fifteen possible different local quartic terms in the lagrangian .    fortunately , not all of these still numerous quartic terms are independent , and there are linear constraints between them implied by the algebraic fierz identities .",
    "@xcite the fierz transformations are rewritings of a given quartic term in terms of others , and we provide the general formalism for determining the number and the type of independent quartic couplings of a given symmetry . for the case at hand we find that spinless electrons interacting with short - range interactions on honeycomb lattice are in fact described by only _",
    "six _ independent local quartic terms .",
    "the inclusion of electron spin would double this number to twelve .",
    "the linearized noninteracting lagrangian for dirac electrons , @xmath14 as well - known , exhibits the lorentz and the global @xmath3 ( `` chiral '' ) symmetry .",
    "the latter , generated by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , is nothing but the `` rotation '' of the `` pseudospin '' , or `` valley '' , corresponding to two inequivalent dirac points .",
    "@xcite a general quartic term allowed by the lattice symmetry , on the other hand , has a much smaller symmetry , as already mentioned .",
    "nevertheless , we will argue that near the metal - insulator quantum critical points , all , or nearly all of the larger symmetry possessed by the non - interacting part of the lagrangian gets restored .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the , admittedly uncontrolled , but nevertheless quite informative one - loop calculation .",
    "first , we find three distinct critical points in the theory , all of which have not only the rotational , but the full lorentz - symmetric form .",
    "this immediately implies that the dynamical critical exponent is always @xmath17 .",
    "this is quite remarkable in light of the fact that the microscopic theory is not even rotationally invariant , and that the critical points in question are purely short - ranged .",
    "@xcite the fact that @xmath17 has important implications for several key physical observables near the critical point , as we discuss shortly .",
    "furthermore , we find that two out of three critical points in the theory exhibit a full chiral symmetry as well .",

    "\\3 ) @xmath21 , which preserves the time - reversal , but breaks translational invariance ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this order parameter can be understood as the specific `` kekule '' modulation of the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals .",
    "@xcite    in one - loop calculation all three critical points have the same correlation length exponent @xmath22 , which we believe is an artifact of the quadratic approximation .",
    "the result that the dynamical critical exponent @xmath17 is , on the other hand , possibly exact .",
    "if we denote the relevant interaction parameter with @xmath23 , the fermi velocity near the transition scales as @xmath24 so the above value of @xmath25 would simply imply that it stays regular at the transition .",
    "this appears to be in agreement with the picture of the transition as the opening of the relativistic `` mass '' in the spectrum .",
    "the mass - gap in the insulating phase scales as usual @xcite as @xmath26 the transition on the metallic side is manifested as vanishing of the residue of the quasiparticle pole @xcite @xmath27 where we assumed @xmath17 .",
    "( a more general power - law is discussed in the text . ) at one - loop the fermion anomalous dimension @xmath28 vanishes , but in general it is a positive , small , and critical - point - dependent number . the overall picture of the metal - insulator transition that emerges is presented in fig .",

    "s @xmath29-orbitals well localized on carbon sites , a further significant simplification takes place .",
    "all the terms without the equal number of creation and annihilation operators for each of the two sublattices must vanish .",
    "assuming again the emergent lorentz symmetry at low energies this allows one to finally write the simplest internally consistent interacting theory as @xmath30 this lagrangian provides the minimal low - energy description of interacting spinless electrons on honeycomb lattice .",

    "we discuss the internal consistency and the sufficiency of this lagrangian and some of the peculiarities of the ensuing phase diagram .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the point symmetry , translational symmetry , and the time - reversal symmetry of the interacting lagrangian as dictated by the microscopic hamiltonian for the system in the next section . in section iii",
    "it is shown how further enlargements of the symmetry would reduce the number of coupling constants .",
    "we introduce the notion of `` maximally symmetric '' theory , which shares the full lorentz and chiral symmetry with the quadratic term in the lagrangian . the general formalism of fierz transformations is developed and applied to the cases of interest in section iv .",
    "the change of the coupling constants with the ultraviolet cutoff in the theory is studied in section v. the atomic limit of the general interacting theory is described in section vi , and the critical exponents are discussed in section vii . in section viii",
    "we discuss the scaling of the electron propagator and the power - laws for various quantities of interest .",
    "the discussion of the long - range coulomb interaction and the critical behavior of the specific heat and the optical conductivity are given in section ix , and the summary in section x. finally , in appendixes we present some of the requisite technical details : the fierz transformation , the spectral form of the asymmetric matrix needed in section iv , and an alternative implementation of the renormalization group in presence of linear constraints .",
    "as the simplest microscopic model that contains the relevant physics we may consider the tight - binding hamiltonian on the graphene s honeycomb lattice , defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electron annihilation operators at two triangular sublattices of the honeycomb lattice . here , @xmath34 denotes sites of the sublattice generated by linear combinations of basis vectors @xmath35 , @xmath36 , whereas @xmath37 are the sites on the second sublattice , with @xmath38 being @xmath39 , or @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the lattice spacing .    within the framework of the tight - binding model the energy spectrum",

    "both the lorentz and the chiral symmetry of the free lagrangian are emerging only at low energies , however , and the term quadratic in derivatives in @xmath47 , for example , would spoil it .",

    "1 . let us consider the former symmetry first .",

    "the unitary part of the time - reversal operator thus simply exchanges the components of the dirac spinor @xmath54 with different valley indices , as expected .",
    "it also happens to be the same as one of the two matrices representing the reflection operators from @xmath1 .",
    "another way of arriving at the same form for the time - reversal operator is to postulate that an arbitrary chiral transformation of the dirac hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 29 ) yields a time - reversal invariant hamiltonian .",
    "alternatively , our derivation may be understood as a demonstration of commutativity of the chiral and time - reversal transformations .    since we have already used the invariance under @xmath49 to restrict the interacting lagrangian ,",
    "time - reversal invariance will be observed if the remaining terms are even under complex conjugation .",
    "all the terms @xmath143 and @xmath144 are thus automatically invariant under time - reversal , but among the remaining six mixed terms , the terms @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 are odd .",
    "time - reversal invariance implies therefore that @xmath148 which leaves then at most fifteen independent couplings .",
    "we found that the exact symmetries of the microscopic hamiltonian , @xmath1 , translational , and the time - reversal , leave at most fifteen independent short - range couplings . anticipating some of the results ,",
    "it is interesting to deduce the further reductions of the number of couplings if one by hand imposes larger symmetries onto the interaction lagrangian @xmath79 .      since the rotation by @xmath95 is not a member of the @xmath1 , the matrices @xmath149 and @xmath150 appear asymmetrically in @xmath79 .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      finally , the maximally invariant interacting lagrangian would be with the full , i. e. both the lorentz and the chiral , symmetry of the non - interacting part .",
    "this is achieved by setting in the last equation @xmath155 the interacting lagrangian can in this case be written as @xmath156 where the participating bilinears in dirac fields , @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160 are the scalar ( vector ) , scalar ( scalar ) , vector ( scalar ) , and vector ( vector ) under the chiral ( lorentz ) transformation .",
    "the last form makes the lorentz and the chiral symmetry of the lagrangian @xmath161 manifest .",
    "such a _ maximally symmetric _",
    "lagrangian contains therefore at most only four coupling constants .",
    "the number of independent couplings is further reduced by the existence of algebraic identities between seemingly different quartic terms .",
    "the derivation of the so - called fierz transformation , which allows one to write a given local quartic term in terms of other quartic terms is provided in appendix a. a systematic application of this transformation allows one to reduce the number of independent couplings for a given symmetry of the interacting lagrangian .",
    "the application of fierz identity to the set of quartic terms allowed by the assumed symmetry in principle leads to the set of linear constraints of the form @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a real typically asymmetric matrix , and @xmath164 is a column ; the elements of which are the quartic terms allowed by the symmetry .",
    "of course , only the quartic terms which share the same symmetry may be related by fierz transformations .",
    "for example , in the maximally symmetric case @xmath165 .",
    "when the number of couplings is small it is easy to discern the linearly independent combinations of the original terms , but when it is not , as the case is for @xmath166 microscopic symmetry of @xmath79 , one needs a more general method of doing so .    in appendix",
    "b we show that an asymmetric matrix such as the fierz matrix @xmath163 can be written in the diadic form @xcite as @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the real spectrum of the related symmetric matrix @xmath169 . in the eigenbasis of",

    "the first set provides us then with the linearly independent constraints , and the second with the set of remaining linearly independent quartic terms . since the matrices @xmath163 and @xmath170 obviously have the same kernels , the number of independent coupling constants allowed by the symmetry is simply the dimension of the kernel of the appropriate fierz matrix",
    "let us consider the simplest example of the quartic term with the full lorentz and chiral symmetry , @xmath178 first .",
    "defining the vector @xmath164 as in the above leads to the fierz matrix @xmath179 with the two - dimensional kernel with the zero - eigenstates @xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",

    "so the maximally symmetric interacting theory is specified by only two quartic coupling constants , which may be chosen to be any linearly independent combinations of the above @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "we may then proceed to find the independent couplings for the next case in order in complexity , @xmath190 , with the chiral symmetry broken down to @xmath110 .",

    "the symmetry ladder may now be climbed back to the @xmath166 minimally symmetric lagrangian .",
    "first , reducing lorentz to rotational symmetry increases the number of independent couplings to four . removing the rotational symmetry finally increases the number of couplings to six . we may note in passing that there are two independent fierz identities between the mixed terms that obey the time - reversal symmetry in eq .",

    "there are only two coupling constants to consider in this case , and we choose them to be @xmath201 and @xmath202 , which correspond to @xmath203 and @xmath204 quartic terms , respectively . if any of the other two terms would become generated by the renormalization transformation we would use the fierz identity to rewrite it in terms of @xmath203 and @xmath204 . alternatively , one may wish to renormalize the theory as written in terms of physical couplings in eq .",
    "this procedure , completely equivalent to what is pursued here , is described in appendix c. as we integrate the fermionic modes lying in the 2 + 1 dimensional momentum shell @xcite from @xmath205 to @xmath199 , with @xmath206 , to quadratic order in coupling constants we find @xmath207 @xmath208 we rescaled the couplings here as @xmath209 . to this order",

    "there is also a bicritical fixed point ( b ) that separates the domains of attraction of the two critical points , at @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the critical point a is obvious .",
    "since we can tune through it by keeping @xmath211 and increasing @xmath201 over a certain negative value , it should describe the transition into the insulator with the gap that breaks the time - reversal symmetry , described by @xmath216 this state is obviously favored at a large and negative @xmath201 .",
    "note that since @xmath20 commutes with @xmath50 , the line @xmath211 is invariant under rg .",
    "in fact , the perturbative @xmath217-function along this line has to be identical as the one in the gross - neveu model .",
    "we can therefore simply use the already existing higher - order estimates @xcite and the numerical results @xcite to find the critical exponents describing this particular metal - insulator transition .",
    "we return to this fixed point shortly .",
    "the physical interpretation of the critical point c is less obvious , but we can think of it as follows .",
    "first , note that the line @xmath218 , @xmath219 , which describes the thirring model , @xcite belongs to the domain of attraction of c. also , the fierz transformations in eq .",
    "( 50 ) imply @xmath220 the line @xmath221 for @xmath219 , which we name the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) line , @xcite also falls into the domain of attraction of the critical point c. along this line , however , there should be a transition into an insulating state with @xmath222 where @xmath223 is a unit vector .",
    "such a state is clearly favored at a large and positive @xmath202 along the njl line , and breaks the chiral @xmath3 symmetry down to @xmath224 .",
    "we therefore identify c as the metal - insulator critical point governing the chiral - symmetry breaking transition in _ both _ thirring and njl models with a single dirac field .",
    "the picture suggested by the above one - loop calculation in the maximally symmetric theory appears quite natural .",
    "there are two possible insulating phases , each breaking either chiral or time - reversal symmetry , which correspond to possible `` masses '' for the dirac fermions .",
    "both metal - insulator transitions are continuous , and are described by different critical points .    of course , the true low - energy theory on the honeycomb lattice is much less symmetric than the one studied in this section .",
    "nevertheless , we will argue that the two identified critical points may in fact be stable at least with respect to weak manifest breaking of the lorentz and chiral symmetries .",
    "the explicit breaking of lorentz symmetry down to the rotational symmetry can be easily implemented by adding to @xmath225 a small symmetry breaking term @xmath226 which by virtue of being only rotational symmetric is guaranteed to be linearly independent of @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "a weak perturbation @xmath227 to the lowest order in couplings @xmath201 and @xmath202 then flows according to @xmath228 we thus find the critical point c to be stable with respect to weak lorentz symmetry breaking to one loop , the bicritical point b to be unstable , and a marginal .",
    "we suspect that this result , although clearly an outcome here of an uncontrolled approximation , may be indicative of the true state of affairs .",
    "hereafter we will assume that the critical points a and c are stable with respect to weak breaking of the lorentz symmetry in the lagrangian .",
    "it may also be worth mentioning that the complete one - loop @xmath217-functions for @xmath227 , @xmath202 and @xmath201 , which we have computed but have not shown , do not lead to any new critical points at @xmath229 .",
    "the simplest quartic term with the full lorentz symmetry , and only @xmath110 subgroup of the full chiral symmetry may be written as @xmath230 the fierz transformation matrix given above implies that these three quartic terms are indeed linearly independent .",
    "when @xmath231 , the lagrangian @xmath196 acquires the full chiral @xmath232 symmetry , and may be rewritten as @xmath178 .    using the fierz transformation , and after a convenient rescaling of the couplings as @xmath233 , to the quadratic order one finds @xmath234 @xmath235 @xmath236    the two chirally symmetric critical points from the previous section now appear at @xmath237 , @xmath238 ( a ) , and @xmath239 , @xmath240 ( c ) , and both remain critical , even in absence of chiral symmetry in the lagrangian . there is , however , an additional critical point ( e ) at @xmath241 , @xmath242 .",
    "note also that the plane @xmath243 is invariant under the renormalization group , but whereas the fixed point a in that plane is critical , the fixed point ( d ) at @xmath218 , @xmath244 is bicritical .",
    "one also finds that the line @xmath218 , @xmath245 , @xmath246-infinitesimal and positive intersects the critical surface which contains the point e , whereas for @xmath246-infinitesimal and negative the critical behavior is governed by c. for weak @xmath246 therefore there is a crossover from the fixed point at d toward either c or e , depending on the sign .",
    "interestingly , for negative @xmath246 chiral symmetry becomes fully restored at the transition , at least within our one - loop calculation .",
    "motivated by the one - loop results , we will assume hereafter that the lorentz symmetry becomes restored at long distances in the domain of interest , and that we need only consider @xmath190 with the three couplings from the last section .",
    "the situation however , can then be simplified even further , as we discuss in this section .",
    "consider the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "if the @xmath29-orbitals are well localized on their corresponding lattice sites , we may neglect the matrix elements with @xmath247 or @xmath248 . keeping only the remaining , dominant matrix elements",
    "then one obtains the `` atomic limit '' of the general interaction hamiltonian @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the electron number operator at site @xmath72 .",
    "the class of hamiltonians @xmath251 is evidently still rather broad , and would for example include all lattice interacting hamiltonians .",
    "writing the lattice hamiltonian @xmath251 in terms of the dirac fields , however , imposes yet another restriction on the coupling constants . since",
    "@xmath251 is written in terms of lattice - site particle number operators , any dirac quartic term evidently must contain an equal number of @xmath252 ( @xmath253 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath254-term from above in momentum space can be written schematically as @xmath255 and thus contains the terms forbidden in the atomic limit,@xcite such as @xmath256 .",
    "the index 1 and 2 refers here to the two dirac points .",
    "this implies that for any lattice hamiltonian @xmath251 we must have @xmath257 note that the plane @xmath258 is invariant under the change of cutoff in the above one - loop calculation .",
    "it is easy to see that this feature of the @xmath217-functions for @xmath201 , @xmath259 and @xmath246 is in fact true to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the matrices @xmath20 and @xmath260 in the remaining two terms in @xmath196 commute with the dirac propagator , and therefore an arbitrary diagram containing @xmath201 and @xmath259 terms can contribute only to the renormalized @xmath201 and @xmath259 couplings .",
    "so imposing @xmath258 at an arbitrary cutoff guarantees its vanishing at all others .",
    "it is therefore not only physically justified but also internally consistent to consider only the two couplings @xmath201 and @xmath259 in the lorentz symmetric , but chirally asymmetric low - energy theory .",
    "the one - loop result in this plane is depicted in fig .",
    "the transition is either into the time - reversal - symmetry - broken , or into chiral - symmetry - broken insulator .",
    "several features of this flow diagram that should be generally valid are worth mentioning .",
    "\\1 ) there should be two critical points , both unstable in a single direction .",
    "bicriticality of a , for example , would imply that the transition for negative @xmath201 at a weak positive @xmath259 is first order .",
    "this , however , seems unlikely on physical grounds , and , also , it is not found in the explicit large - n generalization of the theory , when the two @xmath217-functions are known to decouple .",
    "\\2 ) the two critical points have identical critical behavior .",
    "this is because the term @xmath261 , in graphene representation , under the transformation @xmath262   \\psi,\\ ] ] @xmath263,\\ ] ] goes into @xmath264 , and vice versa , while @xmath47 remains invariant .",
    "this also means that the two @xmath217-functions are symmetric under the exchange @xmath265 .",
    "both critical points are thus in the universality class of the gross - neveu model .",
    "\\3 ) at the line @xmath266 the single @xmath217-function becomes @xmath267 i. e. @xmath201 flows according solely to its canonical dimension .",
    "this is because @xmath268 where @xmath269 . since all @xmath50 are block - diagonal , @xmath270 and @xmath271 components at this line decouple .",
    "the partition function factorizes into a product of two gross - neveu partition functions , each containing a single _ two - component _ dirac fermion . along this line",
    "the system is believed to have the metal - insulator transition , possibly continuous , @xcite but the @xmath217-function vanishes at least to the order @xmath272 .",
    "each identified metal - insulator transition is characterized by a set of critical exponents .",
    "we will here focus on the three already mentioned in the introduction : the correlation length exponent @xmath273 , the dynamical exponent @xmath25 , and the dirac fermion anomalous dimension @xmath28 .",
    "the other exponents can then be obtained from the usual scaling relations .",
    "@xcite    first , since all the identified critical points exhibit lorentz symmetry , @xmath274 we also find that the exponent @xmath273 is unity at all critical points as well , but this is clearly an artifact of the one - loop calculation . in general",
    ", @xmath273 is expected to be different at different critical points .",
    "the same goes for @xmath28 , which vanishes in one - loop calculation , but will be finite in general .    in the atomic limit , when under the assumed lorentz invariance we need only two coupling constants , the values of the critical exponents are better known .",
    "first , in a perturbative calculation in powers of coupling constants , the exponents at critical points @xmath275 and @xmath276 will be identical .",
    "we may thus expect that in a lattice theory with short - range repulsion the transition is either into the time - reversal symmetry or chiral symmetry broken insulator , in either case with @xcite @xmath277 @xmath278 note that since there is only a single dirac field involved the numerical values of the exponents @xmath273 and @xmath28 differ significantly from the large - n values of unity and zero , respectively .",
    "this raises hope that this non - trivial critical behavior may be observable in numerical simulations of lattice models .    although not of immediate relevance to graphene",
    ", it would still be of interest to determine the critical exponents at the chirally symmetric critical point c , which we proposed to control the critical behavior of the thirring and the njl model . we , however , are not aware of any analytical nor numerical study of the njl model that goes beyond the leading order in large - n calculation .",
    "the critical exponents , as usual , govern for example the critical behavior of the gap on the insulating side of the transition , as mentioned in the introduction . in the present case , however , there are massless fermionic excitations on the metallic side , and one may wonder if and how the approach to the critical point is reflected onto these .",
    "let us therefore generalize slightly and provide the support for the results already announced in the introduction .",
    "first , the usual scaling @xcite implies that at the cutoff @xmath279 electron s two - point correlation function near the critical point and at zero temperature satisfies @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the matsubara frequency and @xmath282 is the transition s tuning parameter . setting @xmath283 we thus find the usual scaling law @xmath284 where @xmath285 is a universal scaling function . from here",
    "we can extract the scaling of the fermi velocity and quasiparticle residue as follows .",
    "first , if upon the analytical continuation to real frequencies @xmath286 has a pole at @xmath287 the scaling relation immediately dictates that @xmath288    let us next set @xmath289 , take @xmath290 , and let @xmath291 . in this limit @xmath292 and therefore @xmath293 . in order to cancel the @xmath294-dependence of the prefactor in eq .",
    "( 85 ) in this limit it must be that @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the ( momentum ) anomalous dimension .",
    "analogously , assuming that for @xmath297 , @xmath298 , one finds that also @xmath299    on the other hand , in the opposite limit @xmath300 and @xmath301 , in the metallic phase at low energies we have fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "this implies that , for example , @xmath302 , i. e. @xmath303 with @xmath304 . combining with the previous relation",
    ", the quasiparticle pole s residue behaves as @xmath305 for @xmath17 , the two anomalous dimensions are the same , @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the dirac fermion s anomalous dimension , and the scaling announced in the introduction follows .",
    "the special form of this relation for large number of dirac components when besides @xmath17 , it is also @xmath22 , was previously proposed .",
    "@xcite the quasiparticle residue vanishes upon the approach to the metal - insulator transition , as proposed long - ago by brinkman and rice , but here in a decidedly non - mean - field fashion .",
    "there are at least two obvious generalizations important for real graphene : the addition of spin , and the inclusion of the long - range tail of coulomb repulsion . adding spin",
    "would simply double the number of couplings for each symmetry , since each independent quartic term would then require a separate coupling in the singlet and in the triplet channels .",
    "the minimal internally consistent low - energy theory would then be the generalization of the lorentz invariant lagrangian in eq .",
    "( 70 ) , with @xmath258 : @xmath308 where the sum goes over @xmath309 , and @xmath310 , with @xmath311 , and @xmath312 .",
    "the lagrangian with @xmath313 would represent the extended hubbard model with on - site and nearest neighbor repulsion , considered before in the limit of large number of dirac fermions in ref .",
    "the interplay between the various instabilities in the theory equivalent to the above lagrangian was recently studied in @xcite , where it was pointed out that the second - nearest - neighbor repulsion implies a negative coupling @xmath314 for example .",
    "the form of the above minimal spinful lagrangian facilitates a systematic study of the metal - insulator transition in the hubbard model , which will be a subject of a separate publication .",
    "few comments on the importance of long - range tail of coulomb interaction are also in order",
    ". weak coulomb ( @xmath315 ) interaction is an ( marginally ) irrelevant perturbation at the gaussian fixed point , and this remains true at the metal - insulator critical point at large - n as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the entire @xmath217-function for the charge coupling @xmath316 can be computed at large - n , and it does not exhibit any non - trivial zeroes .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , several calculations show that by increasing the coupling @xmath316 beyond certain point and for small enough @xmath317 the system can be tuned through a metal - insulator transition at which the chiral symmetry becomes spontaneously broken.@xcite the nature of such a putative metal - insulator transition is in our mind an open question at the moment .",
    "whereas it is possible that it is described by new `` charged '' critical point @xcite corresponding to the non - trivial zero of the @xmath318 , it also seems conceivable that the charge is always irrelevant and that the transition is still in the universality class of the critical point c , in our nomenclature .",
    "yet another possibility is a discontinuous transition .",
    "more work is obviously needed in order to be able to address this issue more conclusively .",
    "it may also be interesting to note that in the related bosonic problem , when a systematic expansion near four dimension is readily available , there are no charged critical points in the theory to the leading order .",
    "@xcite this may also be contrasted with the well - known example of ( albeit lorentz invariant ) scalar higgs electrodynamics , for which the critical points , when they exist , are always charged .",
    "@xcite    probably the central message of this work is that provided lorentz invariance becomes emergent near criticality , for the @xmath29-orbitals well localized on carbon atoms the lagrangian may be taken to contain only two ( or with the physical spin , four ) coupling constants .",
    "if there are no intervening first - order transitions , one can infer then that there are two possible continuous metal - insulator transitions , both governed by the same gross - neveu model in 2 + 1 dimensions , into the states that break either time - reversal or chiral symmetry .",
    "the residue of the quasiparticle pole on the metallic side plays the role of the metal s order parameter , and it vanishes continuously with a small critical exponent proportional to the fermion s anomalous dimension .",
    "in contrast , the specific heat coefficient @xmath319 being dependent on the fermi velocity only , at the transition vanishes discontinuously from a finite value on the metallic side .",
    "near the critical point and for the temperatures much below the bandwidth we may assume that the specific heat obeys the scaling relation @xmath320 for small arguments the universal scaling function @xmath321 behaves as @xmath322 , so that in the metallic phase one finds the usual quadratic temperature dependence @xmath323 recognizing the proportionality of the specific heat coefficient as @xmath324 gives us yet another way to deduce eq .",
    "( 87 ) . at the criticality , on the other hand , @xmath325 with @xmath326 expected to be finite .",
    "when @xmath17 , the specific heat coefficient near criticality jumps therefore from @xmath327 in the metallic phase to @xmath326 at the critical point , and finally to zero in the insulating phase.@xcite    similarly , the optical conductivity near the metal - insulator transition will obey the scaling relation for @xmath300 @xmath328 with @xmath329 as a universal function , and with @xmath330 as the familiar universal dc conductivity per dirac field in the metallic phase .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the specific heat , there is no ( non - universal ) dimensionful quantity such as @xmath331 in the scaling expression for conductivity , and consequently @xmath332 is constant and universal in the entire metallic phase .",
    "right at the transition then @xmath333",
    "so the dc conductivity , while still universal , at the criticality should be different than in the metallic phase .",
    "finally , in the insulator the dc conductivity vanishes , so that the dc conductivity , similar to the specific heat coefficient , in principle should show two universal discontinuities at the metal - insulator transition .",
    "one obstacle to experimental observation of these predictions is that it has not been possible yet to tune the parameter @xmath334(interaction / bandwidth ) in graphene , and sample different phases of the system .",
    "the application of the magnetic field , however , changes this , since the kinetic energy becomes completely quenched , and infinitesimal interaction immediately induces a finite gap . if the parameters of the system place it not too far from the metal - insulator transition , the gap @xmath335 would obey @xcite @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the magnetic length , @xmath338 is the lattice constant , and @xmath294 is the tuning parameter .",
    "@xmath339 is a ( universal ) scaling function .",
    "the computation of the scaling function in the large - n limit , and the consequences of this scaling relation for experiment were discussed at length before .",
    "@xcite here we only wish to underline that the emergent lorentz invariance of the metal - insulator critical point , via its consequence that @xmath17 , implies precise proportionality between the interaction gap and the landau level separation at the criticality , @xmath340 where @xmath341 is a universal number .",
    "such a square - root magnetic field dependence of the gap is well known to arise from the long - range tail of the coulomb interactions , but the above derivation serves to show that its origin may in principle lie in purely short - range interactions as well .",
    "we have presented the theory of electrons interacting via short - range interactions on honeycomb lattice , and in particular , determined the number and types of independent quartic terms in the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "metal - insulator quantum critical points and the concomitant quantum critical behavior were discussed , with the particular attention paid to the consequences of the emergent lorentz invariance .",
    "the minimal internally consistent local lagrangian for spinless fermions is shown to contain only two gross - neveu - like quartic terms .",
    "generalizations that would include long - range coulomb interaction or spin of electrons were briefly considered .",
    "we also discussed the critical behavior of several key physical quantities on the metallic side of the transition , such as the fermi velocity , the residue of the quasiparticle pole , specific heat , and the frequency dependent conductivity .",
    "this work was supported by the nserc of canada .",
    "for completeness , we provide the derivation of the fierz identity . assume a basis @xmath342 in the space of four - dimensional matrices , and choose @xmath343 .",
    "then any hermitean matrix @xmath344 can be written as @xmath345 with the summation over repeated indices assumed .",

    "the minus sign in the last line derives from the grassmann nature of the fermionic fields .",
    "any real @xmath317-dimensional matrix @xmath344 can obviously be written as @xmath351 where @xmath352 , and @xmath353 . in dirac notation , @xmath354 and @xmath355 is the transposed matrix",
    ". there exists such a representation of the matrix @xmath344 in any basis of vectors @xmath356 , as can be seen by multiplying @xmath344 from the right with @xmath357 .",

    "being symmetric , it can be written in the usual spectral form @xmath359 where @xmath360 .",
    "we can now write , however , the matrix @xmath344 in the particular eigenbasis of the associated symmetric matrix @xcite @xmath361 @xmath362 from the definition of @xmath84 and its spectral form we see that @xmath363 , and therefore @xmath364 where @xmath365 , and @xmath366 . for a general asymmetric matrix , the basis @xmath367 and @xmath273 are different , and the last equation generalizes the more familiar form for a symmetric matrix , where they are the same .",
    "here we provide an alternative formulation of the renormalization group transformation in presence of constraints imposed by the fierz identity .",
    "let us demonstrate this method on the simplest example of the maximally symmetric theory . instead of choosing two independent couplings and using fierz transformation at intermediate stages of the calculation to transform any other generated quartic terms back into the chosen ones , one may use the kernel of the fierz matrix to write the lagrangian in terms only of the physical couplings from the outset , as in eq .",
    "the advantage of doing this is that no other quartic term besides the ones corresponding to the physical couplings can ever get generated then by the renormalization transformation .",

    "<S> the general low - energy theory of electrons interacting via repulsive short - range interactions on graphene s honeycomb lattice at half filling is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the exact symmetry of the lagrangian with local quartic terms for the dirac four - component field dictated by the lattice is identified as @xmath0time reversal , where @xmath1 is the dihedral group , and @xmath2 is a subgroup of the @xmath3 `` chiral '' group of the non - interacting lagrangian , that represents translations in dirac language . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian describing spinless particles respecting this symmetry is parameterized by six independent coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> we show how first imposing the rotational , then lorentz , and finally chiral symmetry to the quartic terms - in conjunction with the fierz transformations - eventually reduces the set of couplings to just two , in the `` maximally symmetric '' local interacting theory . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the two critical points in such a lorentz and chirally symmetric theory as describing metal - insulator transitions into the states with either time - reversal or chiral symmetry being broken . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is proposed to govern the continuous transition in both the thirring and nambu - jona - lasinio models in 2 + 1 dimensions and with a single dirac field . in the site - localized , `` atomic '' , limit of the interacting hamiltonian , under the assumption of emergent lorentz invariance </S>",
    "<S> , the low - energy theory describes the continuous transitions into the insulator with either a finite haldane s ( circulating currents ) or semenoff s ( staggered density ) masses , both in the universality class of the gross - neveu model . </S>",
    "<S> the simple picture of the metal - insulator transition on a honeycomb lattice emerges at which the residue of the quasiparticle pole at the metallic , and the mass - gap in the insulating phase both vanish continuously as the critical point is approached . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to these two critical quantities , we argue that the fermi velocity is non - critical as a consequence of the dynamical exponent being fixed to unity by the emergent lorentz invariance near criticality . </S>",
    "<S> possible effects of the long - range coulomb interaction , and the critical behavior of the specific heat and conductivity are discussed . </S>"
