    "in the core collapsing supernovae ( sne ) , medium and heavy elements are believed to be produced by the rapid and slow successive neutron capture reaction , dubbed as r - process and s - process , respectively . in these processes ,",

    "one interesting process related to the deformed nuclei may be the rapid proton process ( p - process ) , which is thought to be occurred on the binary star system composed of a neutron star and a companion star . because of the strong gravitation on the neutron star surface , one expects hydrogen rich mass flow from the companion star .",
    "since the high density and low temperature on the neutron star crust makes electrons degenerated , beta decays are usually pauli blocked by the degeneration , which gives rise to the pycno - reactions @xcite .",

    "<S> we developed the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation ( dqrpa ) to describe various properties of deformed nuclei and applied to the evaluation of the gamow - teller ( gt ) transition strength distributions whose experimental data can be extracted from the charge exchange reactions ( cexr ) . our calculations started with the single - particle states calculated by the deformed axially symmetric woods - saxon potential . </S>",
    "<S> pairing correlations of nucleons , neutron - neutron and proton - proton as well as neutron - proton pairing correlations , are explicitly taken into account at the deformed bardeen cooper schriffer ( bcs ) theory leading to the quasi - particle concept . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state correlations and the two - particle and two - hole mixing states are included in the deformed qrpa . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we use a realistic two - body interaction given by the brueckner g - matrix based on the bonn potential to reduce the ambiguity on the nucleon - nucleon interactions inside nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we applied our formalism to the gt transition strengths for @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and compared to available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> our results are tested to the ikeda sum rule , which is usually thought to be satisfied more or less even under the one - body current approximation without introducing the quenching factor , if high - lying excited states are properly taken into account as done in the present approach . </S>",
    "<S> the gt strength distributions turn out to be sensitive on the deformation parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest most probable deformation parameters for the nuclei by adjusting gt strength distributions to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , many high - lying gt excited states beyond one nucleon threshold are confirmed in most of the gt strength of the nuclei considered in this work . </S>"
