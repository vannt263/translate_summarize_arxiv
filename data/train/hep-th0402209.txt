    "<S> non summable borel , the problem of obtaining these contributions has been largely studied in the literature.@xmath1 among the different methods proposed to tackle this problem , the conventional borel transform ( cbt ) of the weak coupling expansion@xmath2 and its modified version ( mbt)@xmath3 have become popular tools for the reconstruction of the physical quantities predicted by these theories . </S>",
    "<S> basically , these techniques require the exact knowledge of the large order behavior of the perturbative series in the coupling parameter . in spite of </S>",
    "<S> the lack of these series , which are divergent,@xmath4 one can make use of their coefficients to define other expansion in powers of a new variable named borel and in such a way that it is convergent . </S>",
    "<S> then , the resummation of the initial asymptotic series is formally recovered by integrating the convergent series on the borel variable . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> the non perturbative contributions are estimated from the ambiguity appearing in the integration , where singularities ( poles and/or branches ) called ir renormalons@xmath5 localized on the positive real semiaxis of the borel complex plane invalidate these proposals . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , an alternative development , called the generalized borel transform ( gbt),@xmath6 was recently presented which has proved to be potentially useful in overcoming those difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> it avoids the use of series by introducing auxiliary parameters having no physical meaning which are introduced for the sole purpose of making the calculation analytically tractable . these parameters together with the analytic properties of the gbt are the fundamental tools needed to obtain analytical solutions of parametric integrals like laplace - fourier - mellin transforms ( lfmt ) for all the range of its parameter . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is extremely useful to study non - perturbative regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it involves simple mathematics which requires basic calculus such as the evaluation of derivative , indefinite integrals and limits . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this technique has already been successfully applied to different areas of physics such as quantum field theory,@xmath7 polymer physics@xmath8 and quantum mechanics.@xmath9    in connection with the techniques previously mentioned , it is certainly instructive to study exactly solvable models so that the efficiency and precision of the different proposals can be quantitatively checked . this analysis may help in defining criteria for selecting the appropriate approach to be used in more realistic models . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , it is largely accepted that the analysis of zero - dimensional models can provide some insight on the behavior of green s functions in field theories and statistical systems.@xmath10 in particular , the understanding of some aspects of zero - dimensional field theories could leave trails about the non perturbative behavior of these theories in higher dimensions . for instance , classical actions with degenerate isolated minima play a fundamental role in studying processes governing the decay of metastable atomic and nuclear states as well as the transition of overheated or undercooled thermodynamic phases to a stable equilibrium phase .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most popular model of this kind is the well - known zero - dimensional @xmath11 theory with a degenerate minima@xmath1 due to its purely non perturbative feature . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this model is often based on the study of its generating function , starting point for computing moments and green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at present the exact solution is known from the numerical computation of its integral representation    @xmath12,\\qquad g\\geq0 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{fungen}\\ ] ]    therefore , the main purpose of this paper consists in discussing the use and to remark the advantages of the different approximate computing tools aforementioned to obtain an analytical approximate solution of the generating function ( [ fungen ] ) in the non perturbative regime .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the analysis of this model is initially done on the context of perturbative field theory in which non perturbative contributions are estimated from the solution of the generating functional ( [ fungen ] ) in powers of @xmath13 it is easily obtained by rewriting the integrand in eq.([fungen ] ) as a product of two exponential functions as follows    @xmath14\\exp% \\left[gx^{3}-g^{2}x^{4}/2\\right].\\ ] ]    then , the expansion of the second exponential in powers of its argument leads to the following formal solution of this model    @xmath15    even though this solution is exact , it is plagued of difficulties and consequently it does not represent a suitable analytical solution . indeed , the series ( [ exactseries ] ) is asymptotic and factorial divergent . </S>",
    "<S> basically , it means that the contributions of the terms of the series decrease with increasing @xmath16 for @xmath17 and increase for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath19 corresponds to the term with the minimal contribution to the series . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the best approximation provided by expression ( [ exactseries ] ) is obtained by truncating the series at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> given that it depends on the value of the parameter @xmath21 , then the accuracy of the result will also depend on it . </S>",
    "<S> for example , small values of @xmath22 provide a large @xmath23 and consequently there are sufficient amounts of terms contained in this series so that a good approximation of the exact solution is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this , values of the parameter @xmath21 going away from the perturbative regime reduce the value of @xmath23 and the series involves just a few terms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is significantly off from the exact one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this trouble , their coefficients do not alternate in sign avoiding the cancelation of the consecutive terms in the series , which makes it worse the divergent behavior .    in some cases </S>",
    "<S> , the aforementioned difficulties can be minimized , or hopefully eliminated , by applying standard approaches specifically designed to deal with this class of series . in this model , it is clear that the use of the exact expression of their coefficients would simply recover the starting expression for the generating function given by the integral representation ( [ fungen ] ) whose analytical solution is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> however , an approximate analytical solution for this function can be obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactseries ] ) by using the following asymptotic behavior for their coefficients    @xmath24    in which case the resulting approximate generating function becomes a factorial divergent series    @xmath25    which can be resumed by applying the conventional borel transform as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the borel sum of the generating function is obtained from expression ( [ firstasymp ] ) by using the integral representation of the gamma function.@xmath26 afterwards , the sum and the integral operations presented there are formally interchanged to get    @xmath27b% \\left(t\\right ) ,   \\label{borelsum}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the borel transform defined by    @xmath29    since the last expression is valid only for @xmath30 , the integral in eq.([borelsum ] ) can be computed whenever an analytical continuation of its integrand to the borel complex plane is available . in doing so , it appears a singularity at @xmath31 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the resummation becomes invalid ( non summable borel ) . </S>",
    "<S> anyway , a meaning to the ill - defined integral ( [ borelsum ] ) is often given by adopting a regularization prescription . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this generates an ambiguity in its evaluation since the result will depend on the particular prescription taken . </S>",
    "<S> if the cauchy principal value is used , the pole is avoided by deforming the contour of integration along two semicircles centered at the pole above and below the real axis respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence,@xmath32    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33}{1 - 32tg^{2}}}\\pm i\\sqrt{\\pi}% \\exp\\left[-1/32g^{2}\\right ]   \\label{firstregborel}\\ ] ]    where the last term comes from the residue evaluated at the pole .    from this definition , </S>",
    "<S> the estimation of the non perturbative contributions is immediate . </S>",
    "<S> the generating function defined initially by equation ( [ fungen ] ) is analytic in the whole complex plane of the coupling parameter @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the non perturbative contributions which had been excluded in the computation , must cancel those non analytical contributions present in the expression ( [ firstregborel ] ) in order to preserve this property . in this sense , the non analytical structure of the borel transform is assumed to contain information about the origin of the main non perturbative contributions of the model , leaving aside the ones unrelated to renormalons .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , within this technique one ends with an approximate solution for the generating function in the form@xmath35    @xmath36 ei\\left ( \\frac 1{32g^2}\\right ) + c\\exp \\left [ -1/32g^2\\right ]    \\label{regborel22}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the exponential integral function@xmath26 and @xmath38 is a constant to be adjusted from `` experiment '' . in this model </S>",
    "<S> it means from the numerical exact solution ( [ fungen ] ) .    the numerical evaluation of this result is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this plot clearly shows that the prediction coming from the large order perturbative theory is not good for the non perturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the non analyticity of the borel sum ( ir renormalons ) is not the true source of the main non perturbative contributions of this model .    in more realistic theories </S>",
    "<S> the exact expression of the coefficients of the series is otherwise rarely known.@xmath1 however , one can analyze other asymptotic expansion of the coefficients in this model which converge more rapidly to the exact one . </S>",
    "<S> concretely , one of them reads    @xmath39    by applying the previously explained borel approach to this series , the borel transform adopts the form    @xmath40    this series converges to the polylog function@xmath26 @xmath41 in the interval @xmath42 .$ ] explicitly , the expression ( [ borelsum ] ) becomes    @xmath43 t^{-1/2}l_{1/2}\\left ( 32tg^2\\right )   \\label{borelsum2}\\ ] ]    where right now the integrand in eq.([borelsum2 ] ) must be analytically continuated to @xmath44 . as a consequence , it acquires a cut on the positive real semiaxis in the interval @xmath45 $ ] due to the well - known polylog function analytical properties.@xmath46 as expected , the resummation becomes invalid again . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the non analyticity is avoided by deforming the contour of integration along two parallel lines slightly above and below the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it reads@xmath47    @xmath48t^{-1/2}re\\left\\ { l_{1/2}\\left(32tg^{2}\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{regborel}\\ ] ]    @xmath49t^{-1/2}im\\left\\ { l_{1/2}\\left(32tg^{2}\\right)\\right\\}\\ ] ] with    @xmath50 being the non analytical part giving an estimation of the non perturbative contributions </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the suitable approximate solution for the generating function has the form@xmath35    @xmath51t^{-1/2}re\\left\\ { l_{1/2}\\left(32tg^{2}\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{regborel1}\\ ] ]    @xmath52t^{-1/2}}{\\sqrt{% \\ln\\left(32tg^{2}\\right)}},\\ ] ]    unfortunately , the analytical solution of these integrals is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical evaluation of this result ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) shows that the approximation ( [ regborel1 ] ) improves the prediction of non perturbative contributions when it is compared with the first approach ( [ regborel22 ] ) . in spite of this improvement , </S>",
    "<S> the expression ( [ regborel1 ] ) still does not provide a good estimation of the generating function ( [ fungen ] ) in the non perturbative regime .    </S>",
    "<S> setting aside the difficulties present in the borel resummation technique , the computation of the generating function by using the gbt is now presented . in doing so , it is necessary to rewrite the expression ( [ fungen ] ) in terms of a laplace transform . </S>",
    "<S> it is achieved as follows . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the variable of integration @xmath53 is replaced by @xmath54 and a new coupling parameter @xmath55 $ ] is defined . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the integration on the whole real axis is performed on each semiaxis , positive and negative , separately . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the last integral is rewritten on the positive semiaxis by changing variables @xmath56 . as a consequence , the expression ( [ fungen ] ) </S>",
    "<S> becomes    @xmath57+\\int_{0}^{+% \\infty}dv\\exp\\left[-av^{2}\\left(1-v\\right)^{2}\\right]\\right\\ } . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{interexp}\\ ] ]    then , the second integral in eq.([interexp ] ) is divided into @xmath58 plus @xmath59 so that the change of variables @xmath60 transforms @xmath59 into the first integral in eq.([interexp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , this is written as a laplace transform by changing variables @xmath61 to get    @xmath62\\right\\ } .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{newexpgenfun}\\ ] ]    observe that this new expression for the generating function presents important advantages . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analysis of the behavior of both integrals in eq.([newexpgenfun ] ) allows one to identify what is the source of the non perturbative contributions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , they show that , in the limit @xmath63 @xmath64 the main non perturbative contribution comes from the laplace transform . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it can be analytically computed by applying the gbt technique which is described below .    </S>",
    "<S> basically this method consists of introducing two auxiliary functions , @xmath65 and @xmath66(the generalized borel transform ) which depend on auxiliary parameters called @xmath16 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters have no physical meaning and are introduced for the sole purpose of helping in the computation of an explicit mathematical expression for the following laplace transform    @xmath68    in doing so , @xmath69 is defined in terms of @xmath70 by the formula    @xmath71    which can be inverted to get    @xmath72    note that the finite sum comes from the indefinite integrations and it can be omitted whenever the laplace transform ( [ laplace ] ) fulfills the following asymptotic condition    @xmath73    in addition , the approximate computation of @xmath69 , and subsequently of @xmath70 from eq.([fiapro ] ) , is doable from the following definition of the generalized borel transform of @xmath74    @xmath75\\left[\\frac{1}{\\lambda\\eta\\left(a\\right)}+1\\right]^{-\\lambda s}% \\frac{s\\left(a , n\\right)}{\\left[\\eta\\left(a\\right)\\right]^{2}}\\frac{% \\partial\\eta\\left(a\\right)}{\\partial a}da,\\quad re\\left(s\\right)<0 \\label{borel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is any real and positive number , whereas @xmath76 is defined so that @xmath77 . then , the analytical properties of @xmath66 allow one to invert unambiguously eq.([borel ] ) to get    @xmath78dwdt .   </S>",

    "<S> given that the aforementioned expressions ( [ int]-[doble ] ) are valid for any number of @xmath81 , the dominant contribution to the double integral is computed for @xmath82 by using the steepest descent method@xmath83 in the variables @xmath84 and @xmath85 . on the other hand , observe that each value of the parameter @xmath86 in eq.([borel ] ) defines a particular borel transform . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting expression for @xmath87 given by eq.([doble ] ) does not depend on @xmath86 explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , one can choose the value of this parameter in such a way that it allows one to solve eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ doble ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the approximate expression of @xmath88 obtained from the saddle point is computed in the limit @xmath89 to finally obtain    @xmath90^{n+1}h\\left(u_{o}% \\right)\\exp\\left[-f\\left(u_{o}\\right)\\right ] ,   \\label{recupapprox}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath91% } { du_{o } } ,   \\label{fx}\\ ] ]    @xmath92+f\\left(u_{o}\\right)\\left[1+f\\left(u_{o}% \\right)\\right ] ,   \\label{dx}\\ ] ]    and @xmath93 is the solution of the following implicit equation    @xmath94 . \\label{gx}\\ ] ]    in summary , the application of this technique consists simply in solving the implicit equation ( [ gx ] ) for @xmath95 to obtain the expression of @xmath93 and replace it in eq.([recupapprox ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the @xmath96indefinite integrals appearing into eq.([fiapro ] ) can be solved to get an approximate solution of @xmath70 in the limit @xmath97 observe that the expressions ( [ fiapro]-[gx ] ) appearing in this approach avoid perturbative expansions and all of them are unambiguously defined . </S>",
