    "quasi - one - dimensional(1d ) atomic gases across scattering resonances can be realized in laboratories by utilizing the confinement - induced - resonance(cir)@xcite . by initially preparing the system at high or low magnetic field and sweeping the field properly",
    ", the quasi-1d system can evolve on the attractive branch with molecules@xcite or on the repulsive scattering branch that is free of molecules@xcite .",
    "quasi-1d atomic gases have many fascinating properties that are very different from those of 3d gases .",
    "for instance , in quasi-1d a two - body bound state exists for an arbitrary s - wave scattering length @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the three - body recombination rate of 1d bosons is efficiently suppressed in the tonks - girardeau(tg ) regime with strong repulsion@xcite .",
    "a long - lived metastable quantum phase in the super - tg regime@xcite has been realized in the scattering branch of a 1d bosonic system with strong attraction@xcite .",
    "apart from dimensionality , the resonance width is another important ingredient affecting many - body properties .",
    "take ( 3d ) feshbach resonance(fr ) for example . in wide fr , where the width is much larger than the typical energy scale @xmath1@xcite , the system exhibits universal thermodynamics(ut ) right at resonance where @xmath0 diverges@xcite .",
    "ut means that the thermodynamic potential is a universal function of the temperature and density , regardless of any detail of inter - particle interactions .",
    "however , in narrow fr , where the width is much smaller than @xmath1 , the universality is not evident due to considerable effective - range effect@xcite .",
    "another interesting property in narrow fr is that the interaction energy shows strong asymmetry when approaching resonance from different sides@xcite , as recently been observed in @xmath2li fermi gas@xcite .",
    "considering the facts that the quasi-1d geometry is reduced from 3d by confinement and the 1d resonance originates from the 3d s - wave interaction , it is natural to expect the effective - range effect in 3d will also influence the interaction properties of quasi-1d system .    in this work , from the analysis of two - body solutions and high - temperature virial expansions , we study the scattering property and thermodynamics of quasi-1d atomic gases across cir .",
    "we shall show that the quasi-1d geometry greatly modifies the stability of repulsive scattering branch compared to 3d case .",
    "similar to fr , cir can also be classified as wide or narrow according to the resonance width .",
    "we find drastically different thermodynamic properties between wide and narrow cir due to the energy dependence of coupling strength .",
    "the stability of repulsive branch in other trapped geometries , such as isotropic 3d trap or anisotropic quasi - low - dimensional trapped system , is also discussed in combination with recent developments on cold fermi gases in the laboratories .",
    "we use @xmath3 throughout the paper .",

    "compared with wide cir case , the scattering branch in narrow cir shows many distinct properties .",
    "first , @xmath21 is no longer universal at cir ; instead , it sensitively depends on @xmath94 and is quite small at finite-@xmath94 ( see `` b '' and `` c '' in fig.1(b2 ) ) .",
    "this can be attributed to the strong e - dependence in eq.[g_e ] that @xmath95 is far off resonance at finite @xmath143 even its zero - energy value @xmath144 . accordingly , as plotted in fig.3(b ) the two - body levels at finite energies are just shifted by a small amount although the lowest level is shifted half - way . as a result , there is no ut at narrow cir , and the scattering branch is generally with very weak repulsion even close to cir ( see also fig.4 ) .",
    "second , shortly beyond cir , the scattering branch goes through a decay at @xmath145 as manifested by discontinuous @xmath146 and @xmath99 there(see fig.4 ) .",

    "1(b2 ) that @xmath21 will complete a continuous change from @xmath96 to nearly @xmath89 within an energy window @xmath151 . due to the large @xmath89 shift for all energies larger than @xmath152 , we see an large and negative @xmath99 in fig .",
    "4(b ) despite of positive @xmath33 . similarly to narrow fr in 3d@xcite",
    ", we expect the negative @xmath99 in extremely narrow cir will extend to much larger b - field , until @xmath153 approaches the typical energy scale of the system@xcite .    on the whole ,",
    "the scattering branch in narrow cir has weak repulsion(@xmath154 ) or strong attraction(@xmath155 ) when b approaches the decay position ( @xmath145 ) from the small or large field side .",
    "the asymmetry here differs from that in wide cir , where @xmath99 approaches @xmath156 or @xmath148 respectively .",
    "it is also helpful to compare these features in quasi-1d with those in 3d system@xcite . for wide fr in 3d ,",
    "the amplitudes of interaction energies are symmetric for the system evolving in different branches and approaching fr from different sides@xcite , which is in contrast with what we find in quasi-1d system across wide cir . for narrow fr ,",
    "the interaction effect are greatly suppressed for repulsive branch but greatly enhanced for attractive branch@xcite , the same features as revealed above in quasi-1d system across a narrow cir . in cold atoms experiments , all these features in quasi-1d system can be detected using the technique of rf spectroscopy , as has been successfully applied to a quasi-2d fermi gas@xcite and a 3d fermi gas across narrow fr@xcite .",

    "decreasing @xmath11 across @xmath164 , the scattering branch(solid lines ) continuously evolves to attractive branch(dashed lines ) with a bound state emerging at threshold.,width=340,height=207 ]",
    "recently , the metastable repulsive branch of atomic gases has attracted lots of research interests , in the context of the experiment by mit group on itinerant ferromagnetism for a repulsively interacting fermi gas@xcite .",
    "the same group later claimed the absence of itinerant ferromagnetism from the measurement of spin susceptibility , and attributed this to the instability of repulsive branch against the molecule formation for a 3d fermi gas near feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "similarly , the instability of a repulsive fermi gas has also been observed in the quasi-2d fermi gas@xcite , but at negative @xmath0 side .",
    "there have also been quite a few theoretical studies as to why the repulsive fermi gas in a 3d homogenous system is unstable close to feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "for instance , the instability has been attributed to the shifted resonance in the background of a fermi sea@xcite , the pairing instability dominating over ferromagnetism instability@xcite , or the vanishing zero - momentum molecule due to pauli - blocking effect of fermi - sea atoms@xcite .",
    "all these studies can lead to the same conclusion at low temperatures , i.e. , the 3d fermi gas becomes unstable at the place where @xmath0 is comparable to the inter - particle distance @xmath165 , or equivalently , the two - body binding energy @xmath166 is comparable to the fermi energy @xmath167 .",
    "the scattering branch can only be stable when @xmath168 , where the deep molecule can not be absorbed by the fermi sea atoms@xcite .",
    "in other words , in this parameter regime the existence of a deep two - body bound state effectively stabilizes a many - body system at the metastable repulsive branch .",
    "since the physics behind this criterion does not depend on any detail of the dimension or trapped geometry , it should be equally applicable to other cases besides the homogeneous 3d system . in the following",
    ", we will use this criterion to study the stability of repulsive fermi gas in various trapped geometries at low temperatures .",
    "typically we consider three different types of trapping potentials , namely , the isotropic or nearly isotropic 3d trap ( @xmath169 ) , the extremely anisotropic quasi-2d ( @xmath170 ) and quasi-1d trap ( @xmath171 ) . to facilitate the discussion",
    ", we consider the system across wide resonance ( with single interaction parameter ) , while the extension to narrow resonance should be straightforward .    in a trapped system",
    ", a two - body bound state is always supported no matter how weak the attractive interaction is@xcite . for a 3d isotropic trap ( @xmath172 ) , however , it should be noted that the two - body binding energy @xmath173 at @xmath174 side is less than the order of @xmath175 , i.e. , the level spacing of all scattering states@xcite . as a result , in the thermodynamic limit with atom number @xmath176 ,",
    "@xmath177 at @xmath174 side is negligible compared with the fermi energy @xmath178 . the system is then expected to behave similarly to the homogeneous case , in a sense that the repulsive branch is stable only with positive @xmath0 where the bound state is visibly deep ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "this is consistent with what have been observed in mit experiments@xcite . on the contrary , for anisotropic quasi-2d or quasi-1d trap ,",
    "the energy spacing of scattering state is generally of the order of trapping frequency of the shallow confinement , while the binding energy can be of order of trapping frequency of the tight confinement even at @xmath174 side@xcite .",
    "for example , for a quasi-2d trapped system at @xmath129 , @xmath180 , and the existence of deep molecule would be possible to stabilize the repulsive branch at @xmath129 as long as @xmath181 . in this case",
    ", the stable scattering branch can even extend to negative @xmath0 side , as shown in the experiment with a quasi-2d fermi gas@xcite .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn in the quasi-1d trapped case ( @xmath182 ) , which is also consistent with the high - temperature result presented in the last section .    in short summary of this section , at low temperatures ,",
    "the stability of repulsive fermi gas in a trapped geometry relies not only on the existence of two - body bound state , but more importantly , on the value of its binding energy compared with the typical energy scale of a many - body system . in other word , here",
    "the two - body physics should be evaluated in a many - body background .",
    "generally , the repulsive branch in quasi - low - dimensional systems is expected to be more stable than that in an isotropic 3d system .",
    "therefore the low - dimensional system provides us a more favorable platform to realize possible itinerant ferromagnetism in repulsively interacting fermi gases .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the quasi-1d atomic gases across wide and narrow cir .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(3 ) the decay of quasi-1d repulsive branch occurs when @xmath184 .",
    "the interaction energy shows different types of strong asymmetry between wide and narrow cir , when approaching the decay position from opposite sides of magnetic field .",
    "second , we have discussed the stability of repulsive branch for a repulsively interacting fermi gas at low temperatures in different trapped geometries . by evaluating the two - body bound state in the presence of a fermi sea ,",
    "we conclude that the system can generally be more stable in the quasi - low - dimensional trapped system than in a 3d isotropic trap .",
