    "this demonstrates that the relative change of the velocity vectors and consequently the lensing effects are directly controlled by the number and the orientation of the cosmic strings which intersect the surface s. in the spirit , the method is analogous to the residue theorem for the integration of an analytical function in the complex plane .    without loss of generality",

    "[ ynjunction ] * . starting with the object located at point @xmath56 and moving in counterclockwise direction , we enclose the string with tension @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , there is an image at point @xmath59 separated from @xmath56 by the deficit angle @xmath60 .",
    "continuing further counterclockwise , we enclose a second string ( with tension @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 . because of the force balance condition this is the same as @xmath63 .",
    "so the second image is at the point @xmath64 which is separated from the object @xmath56 by a deficit angle @xmath65 .",
    "finally , continuing further to enclose the third string , the effective tension vanishes due to force balance condition @xmath66 and there is no other image .",
    "this means that the points @xmath67 and @xmath64 form a triangle .",
    "this has an interesting geometrical interpretation : each image acts as a source for the other two images .",
    "the object @xmath56 is the source for @xmath68 through the string @xmath69 , the image @xmath68 acts as source for @xmath70 via the string @xmath71 and the image @xmath70 is the source for @xmath56 via the string @xmath72 .",
    "this is in exact agreement with the prescription provided for a * y*-shaped junction in @xcite .    in this example",
    "the strings are between the observer and the object and the plane of the strings is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "whether or not the observer actually sees an image depends on the angular distances between each string and the object . if a distance is larger than the deficit angle , then the corresponding image is not observable .",
    "one can generalize the example of the * y*-shaped junction to the case of @xmath2 co - planar cosmic strings at junction .",
    "as before , the plane of the strings is between the object and the observer and is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "following the same steps as above , we obtain @xmath73 images plus the object itself .",
    "this set of @xmath2 points forms a closed loop due to the force balance condition . for each image ,",
    "the effective tension is the magnitude of the vector sum of all strings enclosed between the object and the corresponding image .",
    "geometrically , as before , this means that each image is the source for the nearby images via the enclosed string . starting with the object @xmath56 , the chain of object @xmath74 image",

    "now the strings are located in the y - z plane and two light rays are emitted along the z - direction .",
    "if the light rays are on the same side of the plane , then no string is enclosed by them and the light rays will stay parallel .",
    "now suppose the light rays are emitted from opposite sides of the plane . to simplify the analysis suppose the light rays are in the x - z plane so they are emitted at @xmath77 and @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "we already know that @xmath80 , i.e. there is no change of velocity in the direction parallel to the light rays . also , from eq .",
    "( [ vy ] ) one obtains @xmath81 because the strings have no @xmath82 components . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ vx ] ) one obtains [ parallel ] |v_x| = 8 g | _ i _ i n_i y | , where the sum is over the strings in the upper part of the y - z plane . from the force balance condition",
    ", this is also equivalent to the sum over the strings in the lower part of the y - z plane .",
    "interestingly enough , we see that the light rays which start out parallel to the plane of strings are now deflected towards the plane .",
    "the effects of moving string on cmb anisotropy were studied by kaiser and stebbins @xcite . these authors showed that as a consequences of the conical structure of space perpendicular to the string , a moving string will produce a line discontinuity in temperature anisotropy maps , with the amplitude of the discontinuity given by = g ( v ) v , where @xmath83 is he string velocity perpendicular to our line of sight towards the string , and @xmath84 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the effect is due to the relative doppler shift in the photons passing on the two sides of the string .",
    "the kaiser - stebbins effect is a key distinctive observational signature for strings .",
    "methods to search for this signature have recently been discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for older work ) .",
    "one may naturally ask how this can be generalized to the case of strings at a junction when the junction is moving with a constant velocity @xmath83 .",
    "it is understood that the junction and the strings attached to it move as a solid object and the no force condition ( [ station ] ) still holds .",
    "we are interested in change in the observed frequency between two parallel light rays ( with the same initial frequency ) in the presence of the moving junction .",
    "as before , we take the light rays to be moving in the y - z plane , and initially along the z - direction . in terms of eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) instead of @xmath85 we use the momentum four - vector @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "this yields [ v0 ] = r_0zzy dy dz . unlike in the case of a static junction , the riemann tensor has non - zero components like @xmath88 and @xmath89 due to the string motion . in 4-d space - time",
    "the riemann tensor has more components than the ricci tensor does .",
    "however , we can go to the junction s rest frame where the space - time is static and our results from the previous section can be used readily .",
    "denote the coordinate system where the junction is static by @xmath90 while the coordinate system used by the observer and the light sources is represented by @xmath91 .",
    "we have r_0 zzy = r_   , where now @xmath92 has no time - like indices .    in general the junction velocity vector @xmath93 can have components in x , y and z - directions .",
    "suppose the junction is moving along the x - direction .",
    "then one obtains & = & | d y d z r_xzzy | + & = & 8 g v | _ i _ i n_i y | . to obtain the final line , the same procedure as in eq .",
    "( [ vx ] ) has been used .",
    "as before , in the above the sum is over the strings which are enclosed by the light rays .    similarly , in the case when the junction is moving along the y - direction one obtains & = & | d y",
    "d z r_yzzy | + & = & 8 g v | _ i _ i n_i x | , where to obtain the final result eq .",
    "( [ vy ] ) was used .",

    "interestingly enough , this formula has the same functional form as that of the a single string @xcite .    the implications of eq .",
    "( [ cmb ] ) for the cmb anisotropies are parallel to those of eq .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) for lensing .",
    "each string at the junction produces its own cmb anisotropies . the change in the cmb temperature across the i - th string",
    "is given by = 8 g | v .",
    "( _ i k ) | .",
    "interestingly enough , the temperature anisotropy is different for different legs of the strings at the junction , depending on the tensions and orientations of the strings .",
    "we conclude that the distinctive signature of strings with junctions for cmb anisotropies is the possibility of line discontinuities joined at a point for an observer looking at the surface of last scattering .",
    "the details of this picture depends on the orientations of the strings and the direction of its motion of the junction with respect to the line of sight . in recent work @xcite , the canny algorithm @xcite , an edge detection algorithm ,",
    "was shown to yield a sensitive statistic with which cmb line discontinuities can be identified in the sky . since",
    "string junctions are a prediction of cosmic superstrings ( simple gauge theory strings do not admit junctions ) , it would be interesting to develop modified edge detection algorithms which can differentiate between strings with and without junctions in cmb anisotropy maps .",
    "work on this issue is in progress .",
    "the lensing produced by the cosmic string deficit angle also produces distinctive signatures for structure formation , namely  wakes \" @xcite . for the rest of this section",
    ", we will briefly discuss the implications of string junctions for cosmic string wakes .",
    "thus , we consider the accretion of matter by a moving junction .",
    "consider two massive non - relativistic objects at rest in the frame of the cosmic microwave background in the presence of a moving junction .",
    "as in the previous section , it is convenient to go to the rest frame of the junction . in this frame , the two massive objects are moving towards the junction .",
    "when the line connecting the objects passes any string , the objects are attracted towards each other behind the cosmic string .",
    "this can provide a mechanism for structure formation by string wakes @xcite .    in the case of a single infinite string",
    ", the lensing of matter behind a moving string leads to a region of twice the background density in the wake of the moving string .",
    "the opening angle of the wake is given by the deficit angle .",
    "the question we wish to address in this section is how the wake structure generalizes to strings with junctions .",
    "the results obtained in section ( * iv * ) for the bending of two light rays can be used for massive objects too .",
    "the only change is the addition of @xmath95 factor due to the change of frame .",
    "the relative velocity between the massive objects at the intersection is [ wake1 ] v & = & -8 g v k _",
    "i . on the other hand ,",
    "the angle between the particles trajectories is @xmath96 , and one obtains @xmath97 . in each of these regions ,",
    "the matter density is doubled , i.e. @xmath98 .    since the cosmic strings can not be the dominant source of structure formation , and since string wakes undergo non - trivial non - linear evolution , it will presumably be more difficult to find distinctive signatures for string junctions in large - scale structure surveys than in cmb anisotropy maps . in principle , topological statistics such as minkowski functionals @xcite have the power to find such signatures @xcite .",
    "working at the level of linearized gravity , we have derived the metric of a static string junction , with an arbitrary number of strings joining .",
    "we have shown that away from the world sheet of the strings , the metric is flat .",
    "thus , the geometry generalizes that for a single straight infinitely long string .",
    "each string segment produces a deficit angle , and thus deflects both light and matter .",
    "we have derived the lensing of light by a string junction , discussed the cmb anisotropies produced by a string junction which is in uniform motion relative to the frame of the microwave background , and commented on the formation of string wakes .",
    "we have identified a junction of line discontinuities in cmb anisotropy maps as a distinctive signature of strings with junctions , and proposed that one could look for these signatures by a generalized edge detection algorithm .",
    "finding positive evidence for such string segments would provide a boost for superstring theory , since it is in the context of superstring theory that the existence of strings with junctions first came to prominence .",
