    "if so , how to reconstruct a ( nice ) projective scheme from its intersection pattern ?    _ ( quantitative problem ) _ under extra algebraic parameters , can we strengthen the combinatorial conclusion quantitatively ?",
    "( e.g.  can we bound the graph diameter , connectivity , or expansion ? )    it is not difficult to show that any connected graph is indeed dual to some algebraic curve , as elegantly explained in kollr @xcite . here",
    "we prove the following :    * theorem * ( theorem [ thm : cmfromgraph ] ) any connected graph @xmath6 is dual to an arithmetically cohen  macaulay reduced curve @xmath7 , of regularity @xmath5 , with the additional property that all irreducible components of @xmath8 are rational normal curves ( in their span ) .",

    "some progress was obtained in 2014 by the first and third author , who proved that if @xmath0 is an arithmetically gorenstein ( reduced ) subspace arrangement of regularity @xmath1 , then the dual graph of @xmath2 is @xmath15-connected ( * ? ? ?",
