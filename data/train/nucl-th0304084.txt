    "two particle  two hole states in nuclei can be excited through the action of two - body electromagnetic ( em ) currents that enter via noether s theorem and the requirement of minimal coupling once an effective lagrangian ( embodying baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom ) is invoked .",
    "the currents reflect the dual role played by mesons in nuclear structure studies : mesons carry both the force which accounts for the binding of nuclei and the currents ( in particular the em current ) which respond to external fields impinging on the nucleus .",
    "accordingly , the natural classification into mec and correlation currents follows .",
    "in particular , both substantially contribute to the inclusive , inelastic scattering of electrons from nuclei in the excitation energy domain extending through the quasielastic peak ( qep ) to high inelasticity , the region we shall explore in the present paper .    a long - standing issue of hadronic modeling is the difficulty of treating currents and interactions consistently , that is , of respecting gauge invariance by fulfilling the continuity equation .",
    "the model employed in the present study , the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model , has special advantages over most others : gauge invariance can be respected and fully relativistic modeling , while not easy , can be undertaken .",
    "given the focus of modern electron scattering experiments on kinematics where the energies and momenta transferred to the nucleus are large , and thus where relativity is expected to be important , one has strong motivation to explore such models in which fundamental symmetries can be maintained , even at the expense of accepting their obvious dynamical limitations . given the necessity to break the problem down into tractable pieces , in the present work we forgo the issue of gauge invariance and focus on a fully relativistic description of the mec contribution to the em excitation of the 2p-2h states of the rfg .",
    "this is already a non - trivial computational problem and thus the issue of how gauge invariance can be maintained ( which is presently also being explored in other work ) is left for future presentation .",
    "furthermore , we shall limit our attention in this work to the roles played by the pion and @xmath1 in obtaining the mec contributions specifically to the transverse response @xmath0 .",
    "the relevance of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 in @xmath0 for the physics of the quasielastic regime is well - established and , moreover , we wish to compare our results with the only existing fully relativistic computation of the 2p-2h mec contribution to @xmath0 , namely that of @xcite ( quoted as dbt in the following ) . that this is to our knowledge the only previous study of this type is not surprising .",
    "indeed , to carry out our project it has been necessary to compute a very large number of terms .",
    "specifically , to get the direct contribution ( see below ) we have had to compute about 3000 terms , whereas to get the exchange contribution ( which , as we shall see , comes into play only via the @xmath1-isobar ) it has been necessary to compute more than 100,000 terms .",
    "the analytic manipulation of the traces of the relativistic currents has been done using the algebraic computer program form @xcite , and the numerical computation of the individual relativistic contributions requires up to seven - dimensional monte carlo integrations .    to make direct comparison between our results and those of dbt we have used exactly the same form factors and @xmath1-width of the latter ,",
    "although more modern versions of these quantities can straightforwardly be incorporated  in future work we will update our predictions by doing so . in order to appreciate the importance of lorentz covariance ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath0 for the rfg not only fully relativistically , but also in the non - relativistic limit . for the latter",
    "a few calculations are available , specifically those carried out in @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , in the current work some important differences between the dbt results and our results in the high energy domain are found , notably in the non - relativistic approximations obtained in the two studies .",

    "we have checked this by setting all of the current matrix elements entering in eq .",

    "[ fig : rtrsep ] ( for the relativistic one ) . in both instances",
    "the contribution of the @xmath1 to @xmath0 is seen to be overwhelming ( although this @xmath1-dominance is mildly reduced by relativity ) , the more so at the larger momentum transfer .",
    "this feature strongly suggests the need for an appropriate treatment of the @xmath1 degrees of freedom in obtaining em responses over the whole kinematical regime under study .",
    "in particular the dynamical propagation of the latter appears to be essential , as discussed below .",

    "we have adopted the same expression as in dbt .    to assess the crucial role played in @xmath0 by the @xmath1 propagator more fully , in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrprop ] we display the relativistic transverse response ( hence computed with the dynamical @xmath1 propagator ) together with those obtained by neglecting the frequency dependence of @xmath105 ( the width of the @xmath1 being neglected as well ) in the two possible choices of a static ( @xmath106 ) and of a constant @xmath1 propagator .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of @xmath0 to @xmath105 is clearly shown by the results in the figure .    one can understand even better the importance of treating correctly the @xmath1 propagation by comparing the full relativistic results with a calculation employing the non - relativistic @xmath107 and @xmath108 vertices , but retaining the relativistic , dynamical energy dependence in the denominator of the @xmath1 propagator , @xmath109 . in other words , one can invoke a hybrid model in which everything is kept non - relativistic , but where the dynamic dependence in the @xmath1 propagator is retained .",
    "the results are mixed .",
    "if one wishes to study only the region extending through the peak seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrprop ] out to the light - cone _ and _ wishes only to work at relatively small momentum transfers such as those in the figure , then this hybrid approach is reasonably good , incurring errors typically of @xmath110 .    however , this is not a general statement .",
    "first , if one addresses higher @xmath111-values , much larger relativistic effects are apparent and the hybrid approach is not very successful . for instance , at @xmath112(@xmath113 )  gev / c the typical error made at the peak is @xmath114 . secondly , if one focuses on the scaling region  as we shall in the follow - up study that is presently in progress  then even at relatively low values of @xmath111 the effects of relativity ( i.  e. , effects other than the nature of the @xmath1 propagator ) are large .",
    "for instance , even at @xmath91  mev / c one finds effects exceeding 100% in the scaling region .",
    "this is not apparent in the figures presented here , since the cross sections are so small in that region .",
    "however , this does not mean that the scaling region is irrelevant  quite the opposite , the total cross section is also very small ( but measurable ) and the 2p-2h mec effects are far from negligible .",

    "the relativistic transverse response function @xmath94 at @xmath90  mev / c and @xmath91  mev / c computed with various versions of the @xmath1 propagator to illustrate the sensitivity to the latter : exact propagator ( solid ) , static propagator ( dashed ) and constant propagator ( dotted ) ( see text for the related definitions ) . in all instances @xmath95  mev and @xmath92  @xmath93.,height=188 ]    next let us comment on several general features that characterize the response in the 2p-2h sector in contradistinction with the 1p-1h case . in particular , the clean theoretical separation between the 1p-1h and the 2p-2h contributions holds only in the pure rfg framework . here ,",
    "moreover , the 1p-1h response is strictly confined to the well - known kinematical domain . in finite nuclei , or even in a correlated infinite fermi system , neither of the above statements is valid any longer .",
    "we stick however to the pure rfg because this is the only model that allows us to maintain the fundamental principles of lorentz covariance , gauge invariance and translational invariance .",
    "the 2p-2h response function resides on the entire spacelike domain of the @xmath115-plane , in contrast to the 1p-1h case , which , as mentioned above , is constrained to a limited region  for recent fully relativistic studies of the 1p-1h response see @xcite . since momentum conservation involves only the total momentum",
    "there is no limitation on the momentum of a particle taking part in the 2p-2h excitations and hence the energy of the latter will vary over a broad range extending from @xmath116 to the light - cone .    in summary , naively the 2p-2h response function @xmath117",
    "might not be expected to display any particular structure , but rather to appear as a broad background . as a matter of fact , as we have seen , @xmath117 indeed displays structure , but related not to the nuclear spectrum involved but to the role played by the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "furthermore , we have found that it grows with @xmath96 , reflecting the associated growth of the phase space .",
    "indeed the density per unit energy of the 2p-2h excitations goes as @xmath118 .      considering the purely pionic mec currents , it is well known  @xcite that the 1p-1h excited states of the rfg are reached only through the _ exchange _ term of the related mec diagrams . in contrast the 2p-2h states are reached only through the _ direct _ term .",
    "the origin of these kinds of `` selection rules '' stems , in the first case , from the spin - isospin saturation of the rfg , in the second from the impossibility of fulfilling charge conservation in the exchange contribution for the diagrams displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mecpion ] .",
    "the @xmath1-current , however , eludes the above constraints .",
    "it provides a direct contribution in the 1p-1h sector of the rfg spectrum , as well as an exchange contribution in the 2p-2h sector , both alone and through the interference with the pionic currents .     the transverse response function @xmath94 at @xmath90  mev / c and @xmath91",
    "mev / c including the exchange contributions : non - relativistic direct ( positive dotted ) , non - relativistic exchange ( negative dotted ) , non - relativistic total ( light solid ) , relativistic direct ( positive dashed ) , relativistic exchange ( negative dashed ) and relativistic total ( heavy solid ) . in all instances",
    "@xmath95  mev and @xmath92  @xmath93.,height=188 ]    the exchange contributions are included together with the ( larger ) direct ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtex ] .",
    "two features are immediately apparent from the figure .",
    "first , the impact of relativity on the exchange terms is as substantial as it is for the direct ones .",
    "moreover , as for the direct case , the exchange response is first enhanced in the region of the @xmath1 and then dampened by the relativistic effects as one approaches the light cone .",
    "second , the relative magnitude of the exchange terms is seen to increase both with the energy transfer and with the momentum transfer .",
    "the fraction of the total relativistic response due to exchange goes from roughly 4% at low @xmath96 to 29% at the light cone for @xmath90  mev / c and from 7% to 39% for @xmath91  mev / c .",
    "thus , the exchange contribution , while not the dominant one in the kinematical situations we have explored , appears to us not only far from negligible , but also potentially interesting in connection with scaling ( see below ) .    finally ,",
    "as for the direct case , note that the present calculation of the non - relativistic exchange contribution agrees with the calculation at lower momenta reported in  @xcite , whereas does not agree with that of dbt .",
    "the relativistic response , on the other hand , roughly agrees with dbt .",
    "in this paper we have carried out a fully relativistic calculation of the mec contribution of 2p-2h excitations to the transverse inclusive response within the context of the rfg .",
    "these excitations are reached through the action of the mec including the part associated with the @xmath1 degrees of freedom .",
    "we have compared our results with those of dbt , the only existing relativistic study before the present one and we have pointed out similarities and differences between the two studies . to gauge the difficulty of this project it might help to stress again , as anticipated in the introduction , that the number of terms we have computed to get @xmath0 amounts to over @xmath119 .",
    "several new aspects contained in the present study bear highlighting . in particular , while the fully relativistic results obtained here roughly agree with those reported by dbt , some substantial differences occur , especially as the lightcone is approached . furthermore , our non - relativistic results are completely in accord with our own previous work ; however , they are not in agreement with dbt in many circumstances",
    ". indeed , the strongest disagreements occur at high inelasticity and suggest to us that one should exercise extreme caution when invoking traditional non - relativistic approximations in such a regime .",
    "going beyond the extreme non - relativistic approximation @xcite , one can invoke various classes of hybrid modeling where some , but not all , of the features of the fully relativistic model are retained @xcite .",
    "we have pursued such an approach in which the dynamic @xmath1 propagator is kept , but otherwise everything is taken to be non - relativistic .",
    "the results are interesting : at modest @xmath111 ( say 1  gev / c or less ) and at high @xmath96 the hybrid approach is quite good , incurring only @xmath110 error .",
    "however , at higher @xmath111-values , even in the high @xmath96 region , and at low @xmath96 , even for modest @xmath111 , the hybrid approach is not very successful and relativistic effects are important .",
    "the high @xmath96 region , including the peak produced by the dynamic @xmath1 propagator and the rise seen as the light - cone is approached when @xmath111 is large , might pose some problems for high - energy photoreactions .",
    "the latter are related in the familiar way ( see , for example , @xcite ) to the inclusive electron scattering transverse response by @xmath120 @xmath121 being the fine - structure constant .    in context",
    ", it is important to note that , while one can not go from these results directly to studies of ( e , enn ) or ( @xmath122,nn ) reactions ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , since the rfg is not well - suited to modeling such semi - inclusive processes , the understanding gained in the present work concerning relativistic effects , @xmath1 propagator effects , etc .",
    ", likely can have an impact , for instance via improved descriptions of current operators for use in other approaches .",
    "the @xmath1 propagator provides just one example : it produces a prominent peak in the 2p-2h transverse response and apparently is an important contribution in the total cross section .",
    "it is also very dependent on the specifics assumed , such as what model is taken for the propagator , how medium effects are or are not incorporated , how off - shellness is handled , etc .",
    "in particular , in view of continuing discussions about the off - shell behavior of the @xmath1 inside the nuclear medium @xcite and of our findings in this work , the 2p-2h transverse response may provide an ideal place in which to explore such issues .",
    "clearly , this is not the intent of the present work . here",
    "we wish only to make contact with the work of dbt , using exactly their ingredients and only in future work will we return to address some of these interesting issues .    in particular , in the near future",
    "our intent is to address the difficult issue of the gauge invariance as was explored in the 1p-1h sector in  @xcite .",
    "this requires the introduction of 2p-2h correlation currents in addition to the mec .",
    "only when this task is accomplished will a consistent ( namely , gauge invariant ) , lorentz covariant and translational invariant description of the inclusive responses ( both longitudinal and transverse ) within the rfg framework be achieved .    furthermore , we are now in a position to study the degree to which these responses fulfill or violate @xmath123-scaling of first type ( namely in the momentum transfer @xmath111 ) and of second type ( namely in @xmath48 )  see @xcite .",
    "an exploration of these issues is currently being undertaken for the 2p-2h mec and will be presented in a forthcoming paper , which will also focus on the important theme of the interplay between the scaling violations arising from the mec action in both 1p-1h and 2p-2h sectors .",
