    "super_-diffusive with respect to the euclidean metric ( @xmath80 ) for small values of @xmath69 , ( at least ) when started from the highest points of the free field .",
    "given the authors current knowledge , we can not adequately explain this superdiffusive phenomenon , but we would like to offer some thoughts for inquiry .",
    "first of all , whether the superdiffusivity with respect to the euclidean metric is _ generic _ for every ( or just @xmath22-a.e . ) starting point remains to be investigated .",
    "recall that on a two - dimensional domain , the liouville measure @xmath88 has full support on the set of @xmath4-thick points ( see @xcite for definition ) of the free field .",
    "the discrete analog of this notion is the @xmath122-high point of the discrete free field described in @xcite .",
    "based on this connection , it may be worth investigating on the lattice whether superdiffusivity persists when the starting point is chosen from other high points of the discrete free field .",
    "we do not rule out the possibility that such phenomenon may be non - generic , due to the dependence between the starting point of diffusion and the realization of the free field .",
    "( for example , the kpz relation mentioned in  1 holds for a generic set in lqg provided that the set is chosen independently of the free field .",
    "the kpz relation may break down if the set chosen depends on the free field ; see @xcite for the case where the sets are the level lines of the free field . )    on a more fundamental level , we suspect that this superdiffusive behavior is connected to the idea , long recognized by experts working in quantum gravity , that the euclidean metric is _ not _ the right metric to describe the geometry of lqg .",
    "it seems possible that by choosing a different metric @xmath123 which is equivalent to some power of the euclidean metric , say , @xmath124 , then diffusion becomes gaussian with respect to this new metric .",
    "that being said , we do not claim that the @xmath125 metric has such a simple scaling relation with respect to the euclidean metric .",
    "it is possible that due to the multifractal structure of the liouville measure , there is a more complicated scaling relation between the putative geodesic metric and the euclidean metric .",
    "this brings us to the big open problem in this field , which is to identify the `` right '' random geodesic for lqg .",
    "one approach to finding the geodesic metric on a measure space is to use the intrinsic metric induced from the dirichlet form for diffusion @xcite . but as pointed out in @xcite*4 , the intrinsic metric induced by the dirichlet form for liouville brownian motion is trivial , and this has to do with the fact that the liouville measure @xmath88 is singular with respect to the lebesgue measure ( the `` energy measure '' of the dirichlet form @xcite ) . in order to identify a nontrivial intrinsic metric",
    ", one would have to make a change of measure ( equivalently , make a time change of the liouville brownian motion ) so that the new measure is ( minimally ) energy dominant with respect to the lebesgue measure @xcite .",
    "( for those coming from the analysis on fractals community , this problem is reminiscent of brownian motion on the sierpinski gasket , whose invariant measure is the self - similar measure @xmath126 , which is singular with respect to the energy measure . in order to equip the gasket with a `` measurable riemannian structure , '' one needs to change the measure to the so - called kusuoka measure , which is minimally energy dominant in the sense of @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for details . )",
    "however , it is not clear to the authors what a `` canonical '' choice of the energy dominant measure should be on lqg .    at the time of this writing",
    ", there has been encouraging progress towards identifying the geodesic metric on lqg surface with @xmath127 , see the program of duplantier , miller , and sheffield as outlined in @xcite .",
