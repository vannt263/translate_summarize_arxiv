    "<S> we investigate the interplay between topological effects and mott physics in two dimensions on a graphene - like lattice , via a tight - binding model containing an anisotropic spin - orbit coupling on the next - nearest - neighbour links and the hubbard interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we thoroughly analyze the resulting phases , namely a topological band insulator phase or anisotropic quantum spin hall phase until moderate interactions , a nel and spiral phase at large interactions in the mott regime , as well as the formation of a spin - orbital texture in the bulk at the mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent magnetic orders at large interactions are analyzed through a spin wave analysis and mathematical arguments . at weak interactions , by analogy with the kane - mele model </S>",
    "<S> , the system is described through a @xmath0 topological invariant . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we describe how the anisotropic spin - orbit coupling already produces an exotic spin texture at the edges . </S>",
    "<S> the physics at the mott transition is described in terms of a @xmath1 slave rotor theory . taking into account gauge fluctuations around the mean - field saddle point solution </S>",
    "<S> , we show how the spin texture now proliferates into the bulk above the mott critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the latter emerges from the response of the spinons under the insertion of monopoles and this becomes more pronounced as the spin - orbit coupling becomes prevalent . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications of our predictions for thin films of the iridate compound na@xmath2iro@xmath3 and also graphene - like systems . </S>"
