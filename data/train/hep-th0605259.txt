    "one of the most interesting aspects concerning the studies of multi - field models at finite temperature is the possibility of emergence of a much richer phase diagram than one would usually find in one field type of models .",
    "the possibility that unusual symmetry patterns could emerge in those models , for some specific region of parameters , has attracted considerable attention in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein and @xcite for a short review ) .    for most of the standard physical systems we know in nature , we have a good sense of how symmetries seem to change as the temperature is changed . typically , the larger is the temperature the larger is the symmetry exhibited by the system and vice - versa .",
    "examples of this behaviour are expected to happen in the particle physics models , like in the electroweak phase transition and possibly also in grand - unified models .",
    "the same is expected in the much lower energy systems , like those of condensed matter . for example , the phase transition in ferromagnets , superconductors , bose - einstein condensation of atomic gases , etc , just to name a few systems .",
    "in all these examples we always go from an ordered ( less symmetric ) phase below some critical temperature of phase transition to a disordered ( more symmetrical ) phase above the critical temperature , or the opposite , if the temperature is decreased from a high temperature ( or symmetry restored ) state @xcite .    however , the above symmetry aspects seem not to be the rule .",
    "in fact we are also becoming increasingly aware that entropic effects in multi - field models may show other patterns of symmetry breaking and restoration that are less usual .",
    "for example , many condensed matter systems , like spin glasses , compounds known as the manganites , liquid crystals and many others , commonly show phenomena like reentrant phases of lower symmetries at higher temperatures and , therefore , they can exhibit unusual phase diagrams that we would otherwise not expect .",
    "many of these systems have recently been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "as concerned to quantum field theory models , the possibility of other phase transition patterns was also shown to be possible in the context of multi - scalar field theories at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "these models show the possibility of a symmetry that is not broken at low temperatures , getting broken at high temperatures ( what is called an inverse symmetry breaking ) .",
    "other case that seems possible is a symmetry that is broken at lower temperatures , not getting restored at all as we go to higher temperatures ( what is called a symmetry non - restoration ) .",
    "the problem of how a symmetry broken or restored phase may emerge as a reentrant phase in the system , like it is seen in many low energy condensed matter systems , was recently analyzed in @xcite in the context of a coupled nonrelativistic model of two scalar fields .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the results obtained in @xcite for the case of a nonrelativistic model of two scalar fields with overall symmetry @xmath0 and show that it admits reentrant phases for some region of parameters .",
    "one possible physical realization of this kind of model is for example in the description of a coupled two species dilute atomic gas system .",
    "this is a kind of system in atomic physics that has been of great interest recently concerning studies ( both theoretical and experimental ) of bose - einstein condensation . in sec .",
    "3 we offer a quantum field theory description for this problem .",
    "we then analyze the possibility of emergence of reentrant phases in the quantum field formulation for these systems .",
    "this would be a novel symmetry behaviour that could be of great interest , given its possible implementation in the laboratory .",
    "our results allow us to conclude , at the level of our approximations , on the non appearance of such reentrant phases in these kind of coupled dilute atomic gases systems .",
    "we start our discussion by considering the following nonrelativistic lagrangian density model , of two ( complex ) scalar fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with global symmetry @xmath3 ,    @xmath4    the model ( [ nrl ] ) can be thought as coming from the nonrelativistic limit of a corresponding relativistic counterpart , as shown explicitly in @xcite . in ( [ nrl ] ) the interaction parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 describe two - body self - interaction terms , as commonly considered for dilute and cold ( low energy ) systems of particles @xcite , in which case only binary type interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ , hard core type of interactions of the form shown in ( [ nrl ] ) , are relevant .",
    "@xmath7 is the cross - coupling between the two fields , which we consider here as a quadratic type of interaction .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the masses for the fields ( or particles ) .",
    "the one - body type of interactions , of magnitude @xmath10 and @xmath11 , can either represent the effect of external potentials ( for example a magnetic field ) on the system , internal energy terms ( like the internal molecular energy relative to free atoms in which case the fields in the lagrangian would be related to molecular dimers ) , an explicit gap of energy in the system ( like in superconductors ) , or just chemical potentials added to the action in the grand - canonical formulation to enforce finite density ( or fixed number of particles ) for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the latter will be the case for our application of ( [ nrl ] ) to the coupled atomic gas problem in sec .",
    "we will just consider the @xmath12 parameters as constant one - body parameters added to our model such that the possible symmetry breaking patterns , depending on the sign of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , can easily be determined from the potential term in ( [ nrl ] ) .",
    "this is just what is done in spontaneous symmetry breaking studies performed on the relativistic analogous models .",
    "therefore , for @xmath14 , we have an initially symmetry restored phase in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions , while @xmath15 corresponds ( at zero temperature ) to symmetry broken phases for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we require the model ( [ nrl ] ) to be overall bounded from below , which then gives the constraint condition on the two - body interaction terms , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is the same condition imposed on the analogous relativistic problem @xcite",
    ". this boundness constraint will be observed in all our results below .",
    "non - trivial phase transitions can emerge for negative values of the cross - coupling @xmath7 , which is allowed by the above boundness constraint .",
    "this was shown in diverse instances to be the case in the relativistic analogous models @xcite .    in the analysis",
    "below , we will also restrict , for simplicity , to an initial symmetry restored phase ( at zero temperature ) for both fields , @xmath19 and leave the symmetry broken case for the bose - einstein condensation problem studied in sec .",
    "the phase structure of the model is then determined by the sign of the temperature dependent one - body terms , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the field temperature dependent self - energy .",
    "we look for an intermediate ( reentrant ) phase at some interval of temperature and parameters in which the symmetry in one of the field directions is broken .",
    "this analysis can in principle be carried out within perturbation theory , as described in a companion paper @xcite , which indeed shows the possibility of appearance of reentrant phases for a system of hard - core particles described by ( [ nrl ] ) .",
    "however , the results in @xcite also shows that as the ( perturbative ) temperature corrections are considered for the two - body terms , @xmath22 , these effective couplings run to negative values above some temperature @xmath23 . this then violates the initial condition of boundness for the potential when considering the model in equilibrium in a thermal bath with temperature @xmath24 . at the leading order perturbative calculation and assuming @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the breakdown of perturbation theory in quantum field theory at finite temperature , which is well known in relativistic models ( see e.g. @xcite and references in there ) .",
    "nonperturbative methods are then called for a proper interpretation of the results and to confirm that the appearance of reentrant phases in our model is not just an artifact of perturbation theory .",
    "the problem of the self - couplings running to negative values at high temperatures can be solved , e.g. , by resumming all leading order bubble corrections to the couplings .",
    "this is naturally done in the context of the renormalization group , by solving the flow equations for all couplings and parameters of the model .",
    "a simpler and equivalent approach was also shown in @xcite , where this resummation is also accomplished by solving a set of self - consistent homogeneous linear equations for all effective couplings , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the result of these equations feeded back in the equations for the effective one - body terms , @xmath30 .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for the details and we give here only the main results of this approach .",
    "we consider , for illustrative purposes , the parameters ( at @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these values of couplings and masses could for instance be representative of some dilute bose gas atom or molecule ( see next section ) .",
    "the temperature and the tree - level value of @xmath6 are then changed and we look for regions of symmetry broken phase in the @xmath2 field direction ( for the values of parameters considered , it easy to show that the symmetry remains always restored in the @xmath1 direction @xcite ) . for all values of parameters and temperature",
    "considered we check the boundness condition extended for the effective couplings ( temperature dependent ) , as obtained by the flow equations described previously .",
    "that is , @xmath35 , or that the ratio @xmath36 > 1 $ ] . the resulting phase diagram , as a function of @xmath6 at @xmath31 and the ( log of the ) temperature , is shown in fig .",
    "1 .    fig .",
    "1 shows clearly the possibility of reentrant phases in the system , through an inverse symmetry breaking , in @xmath2 direction .",
    "for instance , for @xmath37 , we find a reentrant symmetry broken phase starting at the temperature @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 k ) and ending at @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 k ) , through symmetry restoration . in this region of temperature and parameters , @xmath42 and the ( effective )",
    "potential is still bounded from below . in the @xmath1 direction",
    "there is no symmetry breaking or reentrant phases at any temperature for the parameters considered .",
    "let us now consider the case of model ( [ nrl ] ) as describing two coupled bose gases of fixed densities @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the model could then be describing a system composed by a mixture of coupled atomic gases , like the ones recently produced @xcite , with same chemical element in two different hyperfine states , or even two different mono - atomic bose gases in the homogeneous case @xcite . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are then explicitly chemical potentials added in the grand - canonical formalism to ensure the fixed densities for each bose atom gas . here",
    "we start describing the system in the broken phase in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions . therefore , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in ( [ nrl ] ) and these chemical potentials are taken as positive quantities and with their values determined by the usual thermodynamic relation , in terms of the pressure @xmath47 ,    @xmath48    where the pressure is defined as the negative of the effective potential computed at its minima ( which is the thermodynamic free energy of the system ) ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that extremizes ( corresponding to a minimum of ) the effective potential ,    @xmath54    the effective potential follows from ( [ nrl ] ) by expanding the fields around the vacuum expectation values , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and it is evaluated in the one - loop approximation in a standard computation of quantum field theory at finite temperature ( for the one - field case , see for instance @xcite ) . at the tree - level ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are given in terms of the minima of the potential in ( [ nrl ] ) ,    @xmath57    at finite temperature , the equations for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by analogous expressions to ( [ phimpsim ] ) , but in terms of the effective chemical potentials instead , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , that are defined by the solution of the self - consistent equations , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , given in terms of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 field self - energies @xmath62 .",
