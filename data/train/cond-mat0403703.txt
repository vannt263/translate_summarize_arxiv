    "conduction of samples where metallic granules are surrounded by some kind of insulator ( granular metals ) have been studied intensively for decades  @xcite .",

    "it is generally observed  @xcite that at the insulator side of transition the temperature dependence of conductivity obeys @xmath2.\\ ] ] recently , similar temperature dependence was observed in doped systems of self - assembled germanium quantum dots on the silicon surface  @xcite and cdse nanocrystal thin films  @xcite .",
    "below we talk about both granular metal and semiconductor dot structures universally using the word dot for brevity .        in doped semiconductors the temperature dependence of eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) is also widely observed at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is interpreted as the variable range hopping conductivity between impurities in the presence of the coulomb gap  @xcite of the density of states ( dos ) and is called the efros - shklovskii ( es ) law . in a @xmath3-type",
    "lightly doped compensated semiconductor all acceptors are negatively charged and randomly situated , an equal number of donors are charged positively .",
    "together all random charges create a random potential shifting donor levels up and down .",
    "this results in finite bare dos @xmath4 at the fermi level @xmath5",
    ". long range coulomb interaction of localized electrons then produces the parabolic coulomb gap in dos @xmath6 at the fermi level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ) leading to es law with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a constant factor , @xmath9 is dielectric constant and @xmath10 is the localization length .        in contrary to a doped semiconductor , in an array of neutral dots the bare dos at the fermi level @xmath11 and there is no justification for es law , which requires a non - zero @xmath4 to begin with . let us consider a sparse array of dots with the same radius @xmath12 shown on fig .  [ fig : x ] .",
    "charging energy levels of such array are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] . here",
    "we assume that dots are large enough , so that spacing between charging levels @xmath13 is much greater than spacing between quantum levels of the dot with a given charge .",
    "empty peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] correspond to energies necessary to charge a neutral dot by the first , second and so on electrons transferring them from the macroscopic piece of the same metal .",
    "shaded ( filled ) peaks correspond to , taken with the sign minus , energies necessary to extract first , second and so on electrons from the dot , or in other words , this is density of states of holes . the fermi level of the array is at zero between two peaks and coincides with the fermi level of macroscopic piece of the same metal .",
    "we want to emphasize that in each dot we are dealing with the ground state at a given number of electrons and exclude excited states ( higher quantum levels ) because the ground states of dots determine the low temperature hopping transport .",
    "indeed , in the miller - abrahams network  @xcite of resistances connecting all dots , the exponentially large activation factor of each resistance depends on probabilities of occupation of a dot by a given number of electrons .",
    "exponential temperature dependencies of these probabilities , as well as the partition functions of dots are determined by ground state energies  @xcite .",
    "thus , the density of states of the array we need can be called bare density of ground states ( bdogs ) .",
    "note that in a lightly doped semiconductor with several equivalent conduction band minima each donor has excited states close to the ground state , i. e. situation is similar to large dots .",
    "still exponential temperature dependence of hopping conductivity depends only on bdogs  @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate the role of bdogs in a clean sparse array ( fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] ) . in this case",
    ", conductivity requires activation of electron - hole pairs or in other words , transfer of an electron between two originally neutral dots .",

    "where @xmath15 is the charging energy .",
    "how then can we explain observation of es law ? apparently bdogs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] should be smeared in the vicinity of the fermi level due to some kind of disorder .",
    "a simplest source of disorder is distribution of sizes or capacitances of dots . indeed , charging energies of larger dots are smaller and this can result in the low energy tail of the first empty peak of bdogs and symmetric high energy tail of the first occupied peak .",
    "still in a neutral system these tails do not overlap and @xmath16 is zero , so that this kind of disorder does not lead to es law .",
    "sheng et al .",
    "@xcite assumed that in a reasonably dense system of neutral granules there is a special distribution of distances between granules or their mutual capacitances , which can lead to es law .",
    "this assumption was found incompatible with other experiments  @xcite .",
    "but more importantly it was noticed  @xcite that in a system of large granules made of the same metal all granules remain neutral in ground state at any distribution of mutual and individual capacitances .",
    "therefore , inter - granular excitation of electron - hole pairs has a gap .",
    "this leads to an important conclusion that granular metal may have finite bdogs @xmath16 and show es conductivity only if in the ground state of the system granules are charged  @xcite .",
    "formally one can imagine that this happens if granules have different work functions  @xcite .",
    "several possible mechanisms of such fluctuations were discussed in literature .",
    "chui  @xcite suggested that very small dots can charge big dots in the case when the former are so small that their quantum level spacing exceeds the charging energy .",
    "we concentrate on the system of large enough dots and , therefore , ignore this possibility .",
    "cuevas et al .",
    "@xcite claimed that even in large dots there are large fluctuations of the fermi level @xmath17 due to random positions of neutral impurities in different dots . to our mind , this possibility can be rejected using for @xmath17 a simple estimate of typical fluctuation of the average potential in the metallic dot due to fluctuation of number of impurities there .",
    "for three dimensional case one easily gets @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is relative concentration of impurities in the dot , @xmath20 is fermi wave - vector , and we assume that size of an impurity is of the order of @xmath21 and its potential @xmath22 . at large @xmath12",
    "this energy is apparently smaller than charging energy @xmath13 even at @xmath23 , so that dots remain neutral .",
    "baskin and entin  @xcite considered fluctuations of surface part of the dot energy as a reason of ionization of dots . again",
    "if we assume that these fluctuations are result of random distribution of point - like impurities located on the dot surface we come to conclusion that corresponding fluctuation of energy decreases like @xmath24 and can not compete with the charging energy .",
    "thus , simplest internal mechanisms of fluctuations of the work function mentioned above are too weak to charge array of three - dimensional dots .    in this paper",
    "we study models of arrays of dots affected by external disorder , where the origin of charging and bdogs @xmath25 is transparent and in some cases controllable .",
    "we assume that the insulator between clean dots has a concentration of donors @xmath26 with electron energy @xmath27 higher than fermi energy @xmath5 in dots , so that at low temperatures all donor donate an electron to dots and charge them . for a given concentration of dots @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] ) we can introduce the average number of extra electrons per dot @xmath29 , which by analogy with quantum hall effect can be called the filling factor .",
    "maximum number of electrons which can be added to a dot is @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 so that all donors lose their electrons . in the semiconductor language we are dealing with compensated @xmath32-type semiconductor where dots play the role of multi - charged acceptors .    in sec .",
    "ii we summarize our main results for bdogs at the fermi level @xmath16 as function of the filling factor @xmath33 . in sec .",
    "iii the sparse 3d array of dots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] ) is discussed . in sec .",
    "iv we extend this discussion to 2d array . in sec .",
    "v we study in detail the super - dense 3d array shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dense ] , which is the other extreme , and then comment on the realistic moderately dense array ( fig .",
    "[ fig : almost ] ) .",
    "we also see how the properties of sparse 3d arrays cross over to dense arrays . after studying different arrays one can see that external doping brings about non - zero @xmath16 and leads to es law .",
    "we start from sparse three dimensional arrays of dots of the same radius @xmath12 , which are randomly situated in space with concentration @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the dots are big enough so that coulomb effect over - weights quantum level spacing .",
    "for sparse arrays of dots , doping introduces two types of charges : positive , empty donors and negatively charged dots . both are randomly situated and create random potentials growing with @xmath33 .",
    "these charges result in two effects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : low ] ) .",
    "firstly , the @xmath35-shaped peaks in bdogs @xmath36 become somewhat smeared , since the energy it takes to bring an electron to a dot is affected by the random potential ( the effect is similar to that of gedanken random gate potential ) . as a result , each peak gets tails .",
    "secondly , electrons coming from donors fill some dot states and hence move the position of the fermi level up .     at a certain filling factor .",
    "occupied states are shaded . ]    as a result @xmath16 may oscillate with @xmath33 .",
    "for example , at @xmath37 the fermi level @xmath5 is in the middle of the bdogs peak and for that reason @xmath16 can be rather large . on the other hand , at @xmath38",
    "the fermi level @xmath5 is in a tail between two bdogs peaks , and @xmath16 tends to be much lower .",
    "actually the total dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath33 is somewhat more complicated and consists of three parts , the growing part , the oscillating part and the saturation part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curve ] ) .",
    "the first ( growing ) part takes place at small @xmath33 , where the situation is similar to @xmath32-type semiconductors at low degree of compensation  @xcite .",
    "we get bdogs growing linearly with @xmath33 @xmath39 in the second ( oscillating ) part , @xmath5 typically dwells in bdogs peaks , @xmath40 when @xmath33 is very close to integers , the fermi level drop into minima of @xmath36 where @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the filling factor at which oscillations become relatively small and the third ( saturation ) part starts over .",
    "this happens because fluctuations of the coulomb potential are so big that bdogs is almost uniform everywhere @xmath43 the number of large oscillations @xmath44 is big only when dots are far from each other . here and below we often omit numerical coefficients .     of a sparse 3d array as a function of filling factor ( solid line ) .",
    "the reference to the equation appropriate for a part of the curve is shown next to it .",
    "dashed lines describe locations of minima and maxima of the oscillating part . ]    for less ideal arrays where the dots have slightly different sizes , the distribution of sizes can wash away the oscillations to a certain extent , making the line of maxima lower and the line of minima higher . as a result",
    "the two lines approach each other faster ( @xmath44 is smaller ) than the situation of identical sizes .",
    "oscillations of @xmath16 lead to periodic transitions between the es law and the mott s law at a given low temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : laws ] .",
    "this happens because in the very vicinity of @xmath5 the long range coulomb interaction creates the parabolic coulomb gap ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : low ] ) .",
    "the width of coulomb gap as follows from eq .",
    "( [ parabola ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] depends on @xmath25 @xmath45 at large @xmath25 the coulomb gap is wide ( @xmath46 ) and the conductivity obeys the es law ( eq .  ( [ a1 ] ) ) , which does not depend on @xmath25 . at a very small @xmath25 the width of the coulomb gap is smaller than @xmath47 and becomes irrelevant for conductivity . in this case",
    "we arrive at the mott s law region @xmath48,\\ ] ] with strong dependence on @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 is a numerical coefficient  @xcite .",
    "oscillations of bdogs @xmath49 with @xmath33 lead to oscillations of other measurable quantities .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that in systems with the coulomb gap bdogs @xmath49 plays the role of the thermodynamic density of states @xmath51 , where @xmath3 is concentration of electrons , so that it determines screening radius of the system @xmath52 used below for self - consistent calculations of bdogs .",
    "one can also measure bdogs at the fermi level with help of extremely low temperature ( lower than typical quantum level spacing ) specific heat and microwave absorption  @xcite     at a given low temperature.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    until now we talked about 3d arrays of dots . in sec .",
    "iv we consider arrays of dots located in a 2d plane . in a 2d array dots",
    "can be charged by donors located in parallel to the plane ( @xmath35-layer )  @xcite . in 2d case , however , there is a more practical way to charge dots using a metallic gate parallel to the plane of dots . at @xmath53 results for @xmath16",
    "are almost independent on the way of charging , because most of the random potential is created by dot charges .",
    "dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath33 in 2d qualitatively looks similar to the 3d case discussed above , but quantitatively it is somewhat different ( see sec .",
    "iv ) .    dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath33 in 2d should leads to oscillations of conductivity .",
    "some oscillation were observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "but there are additional ways to measure this dependence in a gated in 2d structure .",
    "first  @xcite , one can study change of conductivity where the gate voltage charges dots .",
    "second  @xcite , one can study inverse small signal ac capacitance of unit area @xmath54 , which is related to the two - dimensional screening radius of the dot system @xmath55 by equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is distance from gate to the plane of dots .",
    "this method is similar to magneto - capacitance measurements in quantum hall effect  @xcite .    until now we talked about sparse arrays of dots .",
    "for a sparse array of dots the variable range hopping conductivity is measurable only when the tunneling length in insulator is large enough .",
    "this probably can be achieved in some cases in narrow gap semiconductors .",
    "otherwise conductivity is so small that it can not be measured . in this case",
    ", thermodynamic measurements of oscillating quantities may be more convenient .",
    "it is much easier to measure conductivity in a dense array of dots .",
    "actually most of cited experiments are done at @xmath58 . in sec .",
    "v we study clean metallic cubes separated by thin layers of an insulator doped by donors in the  super - dense \" limit @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dense ] ) .",

    "with enough impurities the bdogs is strongly smeared and it approaches an averaged value given by eq .",
    "( [ bb4 ] ) .",
    "this happens when the fluctuation of potential @xmath65 is large enough , namely @xmath66    in order to find the critical @xmath44 of the saturation bdogs , let us study the fluctuation of electric potential . for a given quantum dot ,",
    "all the charges within a distance of the screening radius @xmath67 contribute into a collective coulomb potential .",
    "there are two kinds of charges , positive donors and negative dots .",

    "we will discuss the wells and electrons , although our discussion is equally applicable to humps and holes . inside a well of size @xmath67",

    "electrons inside wells find themselves in wells of smaller scale and so on until they reach the shortest scale @xmath97 .",
