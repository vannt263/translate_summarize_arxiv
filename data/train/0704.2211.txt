    "titanium dioxide tio@xmath3 is a well known wide band gap oxide semiconductor belonging to the group iv - vi semiconductors .",
    "it is described in terms of a model structure of ti@xmath4 and o@xmath5 ions .",
    "it has large dielectric constant and dielectric anisotropy with various crystal structures .",
    "tio@xmath6 is known to be an n - type semiconductor with a large energy gap in the range @xmath7 depending on sample preparation@xcite .",
    "previously@xcite , thin tio@xmath0 films of thickness in the range @xmath8 were deposited on substrates of ( 100 ) of lanthanum aluminate laalo@xmath1 .",
    "bulk tio@xmath6 does not order magnetically at room temperature . however , spontaneous magnetization in tio@xmath0 films@xcite occurred in the temperature range @xmath9 .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization was attributed to the oxygen deficiency induced during the growth of the films .",
    "it was argued that oxygen deficiency caused an imbalance in the ionic charge neutrality of the film thereby creating electron donor impurity ions of ti@xmath10 and ti@xmath11 in addition to the usual ti@xmath4 ions .",
    "ferromagnetism , i.e. net magnetic moments in the ti@xmath10 and ti@xmath11 ions , was a result of superexchange interactions between these ions via the oxygen ions .",
    "calculations indicate that of all possible superexchange permutations , double exchange may be the most predominant interaction in view of the filled electron bands of the oxygen ions@xcite .",
    "it is well known@xcite that such double exchange favors ferromagnetism .",
    "our purpose is to argue that the _ same _ magnetic ions and oxygen deficiency that gave rise to magnetism in tio@xmath0 films also play a vital role in the electronic _ transport properties_. specifically , the existence of donor ti@xmath10 and ti@xmath11 donor ions in our films allow for electronic excitations into conduction bands .",
    "the number of carriers in the conduction band varies only mildly with magnetic field and more strongly with temperature .",
    "indeed , the measurements reported here of the hall resistivity is approximately linear in the magnetic field and the the magneto - resistivity is only very mildly field dependent .",
    "the magneto- and hall- resistivity have very similar temperature dependence reflecting the variation of the number of mobile electron transport carriers with temperature .",
    "measurements of transport properties of tio@xmath6 films as well as the theoretical analysis are discussed in the next section .",
    "the films were deposited employing a pulsed laser ablation deposition ( pld ) technique at an oxygen pressure @xmath2 mtorr .",
    "final arguments are presented in the concluding section .",
    "pulsed laser ablation deposition ( pld ) techniques were employed with a weakly paramagnetic magnetic tio@xmath6 target .",
    "thin films of oxygen deficient tio@xmath0 were produced on ( 100 ) lanthanum aluminate laalo@xmath12 substrates . during the pld process",
    ", the substrate temperature was fixed at @xmath13 while varying the oxygen pressure in the range @xmath14 .",
    "films deposited at @xmath15 exhibited spontaneous magnetization and were therefore selected for measurements of magneto - transport film properties . the thickness of the films were in the range @xmath8 .",
    "the details of the magnetic and crystallographic characterization as well as other impurities and contaminants in the films were previously reported@xcite .    for steady currents and with the magnetic intensity @xmath16 directed normal to the film , the resistance matrix @xmath17 in the plane of the film",
    "may be written as@xcite @xmath18 wherein @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent , respectively , the magneto - resistivity and the hall resistivity .",
    "the resistance matrix @xmath17 of the tio@xmath0 films was measured by a conventional four - terminal technique using a gold - plated resistance sample puck from the quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "in that the ferromagnetic moment per unit volume is small on the scale of applied magnetic intensities , @xmath21 , the magnetic field intensity may be identified with the magnetic induction @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 . as a consequence of such a weak magnetization @xmath24 , the anomalous hall resistivity is negligible .",
    "the original hall expression for @xmath20 is sufficiently accurate .",
    "the magneto - resistivity is here described by the drude model .",
    "altogether , we may analyze the data in terms of the simple conventional expressions @xmath25 wherein @xmath26 is the density per unit volume of carriers in the conduction band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is shown measurements of @xmath19 at zero magnetic intensity and @xmath20 at @xmath27 tesla is plotted as a function temperature @xmath28 .",
    "at zero magnetic field intensity and the hall resistivity @xmath20 at @xmath29 tesla versus inverse temperature .",
    "the temperature variations are quite similar , i.e. the hall angle @xmath30 is fairly uniform in temperature.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "one notes that the temperature variations of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are quite similar as they are in other semiconductors@xcite the hall angle @xmath31 , as defined by @xmath32 is experimentally fairly uniform in temperature .     for two temperatures , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the high temperature regime ,",
    "the linear behavior in magnetic field @xmath35 is accurately obeyed . in the low temperature regime",
    "there are experimental deviations from linear behavior.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the hall resistivity @xmath20 as a function of magnetic field were measured at fixed temperature with applied field sweeps in the range @xmath36 .",
    "the data for a high and low temperature are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for high temperatures ,",
    "the experimental data is in excellent agreement with the linear magnetic field behavior for @xmath20 in eq.([transport2 ] ) . for low temperatures ,",
    "the agreement with the linear behavior in magnetic field is only fair .",
    "nevertheless , it is experimentally clear that the carriers are n - type and the carrier densities may be determined by @xmath37 quite accurately for high temperatures and somewhat less accurately for low temperatures .",
    "the resulting variation of the density of carriers @xmath26 with temperature @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .     as a function of temperature taken from hall resistivity data in a fixed magnetic field of @xmath29 tesla . also shown ( solid curve ) is the fit to eqs.([transport5 ] ) and ( [ transport6 ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the two striking features of the resulting inferred density of carriers are as follows : ( i ) the density of carriers does not appear to vanish in the low temperature limit @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , there appears to be a low density of carriers in the ground state tio@xmath41 system of approximately @xmath42 at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "this suggests that the electron chemical potential is placed very slightly into the conduction band by the ti@xmath10 donors .",
    "the double exchange mechanism lowers that part of the conduction band containing electrons with spins parallel to those localized spins producing the magnetization@xcite .",
    "these effects allow for the low density of ground state carriers .",
    "( ii ) the density of carriers as a function of temperature exhibits a clear maximum .",
    "we attribute this maximum in the number of carriers to the decrease of the magnetization @xmath43 to values below the saturation value @xmath44 as the temperature is raised .",
    "theoretically , one finds from spin wave theory that @xmath45/t^{3/2}=a_0 $ ] .",
    "for the temperature range here of experimental interest , we find that @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "if the rise in the carrier band lowest energy state is proportional to the the deviation of the magnetization from saturation@xcite , i.e. if @xmath47 , then a reasonable phenomenological expression for the density of carriers , both in the ground state and in the thermally excited states , is @xmath48\\ , \\label{transport6}\\ ] ] wherein the electron thermal wavelebgth @xmath49 @xmath50 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath51 is derived from the boltzman factor @xmath52 on the right hand side of eq.([transport6 ] ) .",
    "that the density of carriers is the sum of ground state and thermally activated terms is at the heart of our phenomenology . as can be seen from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the model gives rise to a good fit to the experimental data .     of the magneto - resistance in eq.([transport7 ] ) is plotted as the function of magnetic field .",
    "the blue squares and red circles represent , respectively , the measurements taken at temperatures @xmath53 and @xmath54.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally in fig . [ fig4 ] , the magneto - resistivity is plotted as a function of magnetic field in both the high and low temperature regimes .",
    "one may view the fractional change in magneto - resistivity , @xmath55 as a measure of how strongly the carrier density @xmath26 and the carrier lifetime @xmath56 vary with magnetic field . in the high temperature regime ,",
    "the fractional change in the magneto - resistivity is quite small @xmath57 . in the low temperature regime",
    "the fractional change in magneto - resistivity is again fairly small @xmath58 .",
    "altogether , the magnetic field variations of the magneto - resistivity obeys @xmath59 in all regimes .",
    "that the deviations are small provides experimental support for the hall - drude model of electronic transport in eq.([transport2 ] ) for the oxygen deficient tio@xmath41 ferromagnetic semiconductor .",
    "measurements of the magneto- and hall- resistivity have been measured in oxygen deficient tio@xmath0 magnetic semiconductor films .",
    "the data can be understood on the basis of the hall - drude model of resistivity from mobile carriers .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment contribution to the hall resistivity is small in most regimes since the ferromagnetic moment @xmath60 resides mainly on the dilutely distributed ions ti@xmath10 and ti@xmath11 and the magnitude is small @xmath21 .",
    "the drude relation time @xmath56 is only weakly dependent upon the magnetic field @xmath61 and the temperature @xmath28 so that both the hall resistivity @xmath20 and the normal resistivity @xmath19 vary similarly with temperature .",
    "the experimental data can thereby be described in terms of a temperature dependent mobile carrier density @xmath62 .",
    "apart from an expected zeeman internal magnetic field splitting of the conduction band wherein the carrier spins align themselves parallel to the spins of the local ionic ferromagnetic moments , there also appears to be a small but finite mobile carrier density that persists even in the @xmath40 limit .",
    "the theory of such quantum ground state carriers in double ferromagnetic exchange semiconductors is worthy of further investigation ."
