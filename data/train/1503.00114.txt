    "since the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , the search for new physics ( np ) degrees of freedom beyond standard model ( sm ) becomes one of the most important tasks of high energy particle physics .",
    "in many np models , an extra @xmath5 gauge symmetry is often introduced based on various motivations in new physics beyond sm , resulting in an additional massive neutral gauge boson usually called the @xmath2 boson .",
    "quite a few models are of this type , such as grand unified theories based on the gauge groups so(10 ) @xcite , @xmath6 model @xcite , supersymmetric models @xcite , and string inspired models @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "although the @xmath5 charges are usually family - universal , it is not mandatory to be so , and the family non - universal @xmath2 has been introduced in some models , such as in aforementioned @xmath6 model @xcite .    on the experiment side , many efforts have been expended to search for the @xmath2 directly at the lep , tevatron , and lhc . with the assumption that the @xmath2 couplings to the sm fermions are similar to those of the sm @xmath7 boson , the direct searches for the @xmath2 can be performed in the dilepton events . at this stage ,",
    "the lower mass limit has been set as @xmath8 at the @xmath9 confidence level ( cl ) from collisions at 8 tev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath10 by using @xmath4 and @xmath11 @xcite events , and this value becomes @xmath12 using the @xmath13 events  @xcite .",
    "however , if the @xmath2 boson does not couple to leptons , the above constraint from the lhc is no longer valid . theoretically , such leptophobic @xmath2 boson can be realized in @xmath6 model @xcite , the phenomenological studies at the lhc has been recently explored in ref .  @xcite . in complementary to the direct search , some characters of the leptophobic @xmath2 boson can also be constrained indirectly from the  low \" energy flavor physics .",
    "the family non - universal @xmath2 boson may induce tree - level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and thus they are severely bounded by experiment , most notably meson mixing @xcite . other effects of the fcnc in flavor physics have also been studied in past decades @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above arguments , we aim to in this work perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of a family non - universal @xmath2 boson on the pure annihilation decays @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "since these modes are power suppressed in the heavy quark limit , their branching ratios are expected to be very small , and the sensitivity to np can be then enhanced .    experimentally ,",
    "the decay mode @xmath0 was firstly reported by the cdf collaboration @xmath15 and it was soon confirmed by the lhcb collaboration with @xmath16 data as @xmath17 so , the averaged result is given as   @xcite : @xmath18 the branching fraction of another pure annihilation decay mode @xmath1 has been also measured as  @xcite : @xmath19    theoretically , within qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach @xcite , only an order of magnitude estimate can be given for these two decays through introducing new phenomenological parameters ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) or an effective gluon propagator @xcite due to the existence of the endpoint singularity .",
    "the predicted branching fractions are at the order of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effects of su(3 ) asymmetry breaking have also been discussed in @xcite . on the contradiction ,",
    "the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite retains the transverse momenta of all inner quarks , and thus the endpoint singularity disappear .",
    "this makes the perturbative calculations of pure annihilation decay modes reliable .",
    "on the basis of pqcd , the decays @xmath23 and @xmath1 have been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have revisited these two decays with new parameters ( especially for the distribution amplitudes of light mesons ) , and the obtained results are in agreement with the experimental data well . despite the agreement , by comparing the predictions of @xcite with the experimental result",
    ", one can find that the lhcb measurement has a central value larger than the theoretical result , which may indicate some room left for survival of a light @xmath2 boson . in the following",
    "we will use the pqcd approach and investigate the impact of the family non - universal leptophobic @xmath2 model on the @xmath3 asymmetries of these two decays .",
    "our results can be stringently tested at the lhcb experiment , belle - ii , and future high energy @xmath4 collider .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec:2 ] , after a brief introduction to the pqcd approach , we will present the numerical results of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in sm . in sec.[sec:3 ] , we will discuss the effects of the @xmath2 on the branching fractions and @xmath3 asymmetries of these two decay modes .",
    "at last , the conclusion will be drawn in the sec.[sec:4 ] .",
    "in this section , we will start with the effective weak hamiltonian for the @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) transitions , which are given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "the explicit expressions of the local four - quark operators @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath30 at different scales have been given in ref .",
    "note that @xmath31 are tree operators and others @xmath32 are penguin ones .",
    "the pqcd approach is based on the @xmath33 factorization , and has been applied to calculate the non - leptonic @xmath34 meson decays for many years @xcite . in this approach , the decay amplitude is conceptually written as@xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the momentum fractions taken by light quarks in each mesons , and @xmath37 are the conjugate variables of the transverse momenta of light quarks . ",
    "tr \" means the trace over both dirac and color indices . in light of the factorization hypothesis , the wilson coefficient @xmath38 encapsulates the dynamics from @xmath39 down to the scale @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the typical scale of the concerned annihilation type decays .",
    "the hard part @xmath42 , involving the four - quark operators and the hard gluon , describes the hard dynamics characterized by the scale @xmath40 , and it can be calculated perturbatively . the wave function @xmath43 , standing for hadronization of the quark and anti - quark into the meson @xmath44 , is independent of the specific processes and thus universal .",
    "the factor @xmath45 arises from the resummation of the large double logarithms ( @xmath46 ) on the longitudinal direction , while the sudakov form factor @xmath47 is from the resummation of the double logarithm @xmath48 .",
    "fortunately , the endpoint could be smeared effectively with the help of these two functions , which makes our calculation reliable .    in particular , the wave functions @xmath49",
    "( @xmath50 being dirac indices ) are decomposed in terms of the spin structure , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for the heavy pseudo - scalar meson @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )",
    "meson , the wave function @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the color degree of freedom , and @xmath61 is the momentum of @xmath34 meson .",
    "the scalar distribution amplitude @xmath62 is normalized by its own decay constant @xmath63 @xmath64 in this work , we employ the function @xmath65\\label{bw } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the shape parameter @xmath66 gev ( @xmath67 gev ) has been adopted in all previous analysis of exclusive @xmath68 meson decays @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the heavy meson , the wave functions of light meson @xmath69 are much complicated due to the non - negligible chiral mass .",
    "taking the @xmath70 meson as an example for illustration , we define its wave function as @xmath71_{\\alpha\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is its momentum , and @xmath73 is the aforementioned chiral mass .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are unit vectors , and @xmath76 ( @xmath75 ) is ( anti-)parallel to @xmath77 . as nonperturbative parameters , the light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) @xmath78 , should be fixed by experimental data in principle .",
    "though there is no direct experimental measurement for the moments yet up to now , the non - leptonic charmless @xmath56 decays already give much hints on them @xcite .",
    "since the pqcd approach had already given very good results for these decays , especially for the direct @xmath3 asymmetries in @xmath79 and @xmath80 decays , we shall adopt the well constrained lcdas of the mesons in these papers  @xcite ( see @xcite for a summary and update of the lcdas ) : @xmath81 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it should be stressed that we have dropped the terms proportional to @xmath84 , and only kept the first two terms , following the arguments of @xcite .",
    "now we turn to calculate the hard part @xmath42 . according to the effective hamiltonian , eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we can draw four kinds of feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath1 and @xmath0 decays at the leading order , as is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the four diagrams are classed into two types : ( @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath86 ) are factorizable diagrams , and ( @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ) are non - factorizable ones . due to the current conservation ,",
    "the contributions from the factorizable diagrams @xmath89 and @xmath90 will be canceled exactly by each other , so that contributions from diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) are null . as concerned as diagrams ( @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ) , by inserting the possible operators , we can obtain the amplitudes for the non - factorizable annihilation diagram @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 stands for the contribution from @xmath94 operators , and @xmath95 for the contribution from @xmath96 operators which result from the fierz transformation of the @xmath97 operators . the expressions of @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the inner functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtain total decay amplitudes for concerned decays as @xmath98- v_{tb}v_{ts}^{*}\\big(m_{ann}^{ll}\\left [ c_{4}+c_{10}\\right]+m_{ann}^{sp}\\left[c_6+c_{8}\\right ]   \\nonumber \\label{bspipi}\\\\ & & + m_{ann}^{ll}[c_{4}-\\frac{1}{2}c_{10}]_{\\pi^-\\leftrightarrow \\pi^+}+ m_{ann}^{sp } [ c_6-\\frac{1}{2}c_6]_{\\pi^-\\leftrightarrow \\pi^+}\\big)\\big\\};\\\\ { \\cal a}(\\overline b_{d}\\to k^{+}k^{- } ) & = & \\frac{g_f}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\big\\{v_{ub}v_{ud}^ { * } m_{ann}^{ll}\\left[c_2\\right ] -v_{tb}v_{td}^{*}\\big(m_{ann}^{ll}\\left [ c_{4}+c_{10}\\right]+m_{ann}^{sp}\\left[c_6+c_{8}\\right ]    \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + m_{ann}^{ll}[c_{4}-\\frac{1}{2}c_{10}]_{k^-\\leftrightarrow k^+}+m_{ann}^{sp}[c_6-\\frac{1}{2}c_8]_{k^-\\leftrightarrow k^+}\\big ) \\big\\}.\\label{bdkk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([bspipi ] ) , when @xmath99 and @xmath100 exchanging , @xmath91 obtain the results because of su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "furthermore , if we ignore the small @xmath101 ( the momentum fraction of @xmath102 quark in the @xmath103 meson ) in the denominators , @xmath91 is same as @xmath92,too .",
    "however , for @xmath104 , @xmath105 do not share same formulaes with @xmath106 due to the difference between the mass of up ( down ) quark and that of the strange quark , and such difference might affect the direct @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "in fact , in our calculations there are many uncertainties , the most important one of which is from the distribution amplitude of initial heavy meson , because it can not calculated directly from qcd till now yet . in the following work , we shall vary the shape parameter @xmath107 and @xmath108 . furthermore , the contributions from next leading order ( nlo ) have not been done . in the current work , to estimate the uncertainties of nlo , we simply vary @xmath40 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , where @xmath40 is the largest scale in each diagram and the expressions of them have been given in @xcite . combining all above uncertainties",
    ", we obtain the @xmath3-averaged branching fractions of two decay modes @xmath111 since the uncertainties from the @xmath112 meson distribution amplitudes are very small , we will not discuss them here .      for @xmath132",
    ", both branching fraction and @xmath3 asymmetry parameters agree with previous studies @xcite , and small differences are from the uncertainties of the ckm matrix elements . for @xmath133 ,",
    "our branching fraction consist with prediction of @xcite , but the direct @xmath3 asymmetry is much smaller than theirs because they may omitted the effect of the su(3 ) asymmetry in the lcdas of @xmath134 meson . compared with the experimental data , although our branching fractions are consistent with data after considering the uncertainties of both theoretical and experimental sides , the center value of @xmath14 ( @xmath135 ) is a bit larger ( smaller ) than the data , which means there is a little room for us to search for possible effect of np .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath3 asymmetries of these two decays have not been measured in the current experiments .",
    "now we shall study the possible contributions of the extra gauge boson @xmath2 in these two decay modes . ignoring the interference between @xmath7 and @xmath2 bosons , we write the lagrangian with @xmath2 on the gauge interaction basis as @xmath136 \\psi^i_j ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field @xmath137 stands for the @xmath138th family fermion , @xmath139 for the coupling constant , @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) for the left - handed ( right - handed ) chiral coupling , and @xmath142 .",
    "when rotating to the physical basis , the mass eigenstates will be obtained by @xmath143 , and the usual ckm matrix is given by @xmath144 .",
    "similarly , we can get the coupling matrices in the physical basis of up ( down)-type quarks , @xmath145 it is apparent that if @xmath146 are not proportional to the identity matrix , the nonzero off - diagonal elements in the @xmath147 will appear , which induce the fcnc interactions at the tree level . in the current work , we assume that the up - type coupling matrix @xmath148 are proportional to the unit matrix , and the right - handed couplings of are flavor - diagonal for simplicity . thereby , the effective hamiltonian mediated by the @xmath2 , for example @xmath149 transition , is given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 is the mass of @xmath2 boson .",
    "the diagonal elements of the effective coupling matrices @xmath153 are required to be real because of the hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , for the off - diagonal one of @xmath154 , it might be a complex number and a new weak phase @xmath155 is introduced , which might play important roles in explaining the large @xmath3 asymmetries in @xmath156 @xcite . since the above operators of the forms @xmath157 already exist in sm , we can represent the @xmath2 effect by modifying the wilson coefficients of the corresponding operators . as a result",
    ", we reorganize the eq.([eqn : heff1 ] ) as @xmath158 correspondingly , the contributions of the extra @xmath2 boson to the sm wilson coefficients at the @xmath39 scale is given @xmath159 one can see that the @xmath2 contributes to the electro - weak penguins @xmath160 as well as the qcd penguins @xmath161 . in order to show that the new physics is primarily manifest in the electro - weak penguins , we simply assume @xmath162 , and this relation has been used widely @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath163 contributions to the wilson coefficients are @xmath164 where @xmath165 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the other sm wilson coefficients at scale lower than @xmath166 will also receive contributions from the @xmath167 boson through renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "since in this model there is no new particle below @xmath39 , the rg evolution of the modified wilson coefficients is exactly same as the one in sm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we also obtain the hamiltonian @xmath168 , and the corresponding wilson coefficients and inner functions are given as @xmath169 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , we are in a position to discuss the possible parameter spaces of @xmath170 and @xmath171 . in particular , we assume @xmath172 because we expect that both the hypercharge @xmath173 gauge group and the extra @xmath5 have the same origin from some grand unified models .",
    "furthermore , we also hope @xmath174 is at the order of @xmath175 , so that the neutral @xmath2 boson could be detected at lhc experiment directly .",
    "note that the mass of a leptophobic @xmath176 boson has not been constrained till now , as aforementioned in sec.[sec:1 ] .",
    "in addition , we need to determine the other parameters @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and new weak phases @xmath180 with the accurate data from @xmath34 factories and lhcb experiment . for example , @xmath181 and @xmath171 could be extracted from @xmath119-@xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) mixing . in order to explain the mass differences between @xmath184 and @xmath185 with new @xmath2 boson , @xmath186 is required .",
    "then , with experimental data of @xmath187 nonleptonic charmless decays , @xmath188 could be extracted . for the new introduced phases @xmath155 and @xmath189 , they have not been constrained totally , although many efforts have been done @xcite , we therefore set them as free parameters .",
    "how to constraint of these parameters globally is beyond the scope of current work and can be found in many references @xcite . so as to probe the new physics effect for maximum range , we assume @xmath190 $ ] , ie , the range of @xmath176 is about @xmath191~\\mathrm{gev}$ ] , and @xmath192 $ ] .    in fig.[fig :",
    "bspipi ] , we explore the possible effects of @xmath2 boson on the decay mode @xmath135 . in the left panel ,",
    "we present the variation of the cp - averaged branching fraction as a function of the new weak phase @xmath155 with different @xmath193 .",
    "the experimental region ( filled by horizontal lines ) and the sm predictions ( filled by vertical lines ) are also shown for the comparison . from this figure",
    ", one can see that the sm is consistent with the data within @xmath194 . including the @xmath2 contribution",
    ", it is apparent that the parameter space @xmath195 will be excluded . for @xmath196 , if @xmath197 , the contribution of @xmath2 boson will be buried by the uncertainties of sm .",
    "one also sees that when @xmath198 the branching ratio will be enhanced to @xmath199 , which is larger than the sm prediction .",
    "note that the averaged experimental have large errors , and the small band will help us to determine the magnitude of @xmath200 .",
    "it is emphasized that the lhcb had obtained a bit larger result , which indicates the existence of a light @xmath2 . in the right panel",
    ", we plot the relation between the branching ratio and the direct @xmath3 asymmetry @xmath201 with an extra @xmath2 boson .",
    "the region edged by blue curve is the possible region with parameter @xmath202 and @xmath203 $ ] . with the experimental data",
    ", the lower half of the region can be excluded . in the permitted region ,",
    "the range of direct @xmath3 asymmetry is @xmath204 $ ] , which is much larger than the estimation of sm ( the grey region ) .",
    "the future measurement of these values in lhcb ( lhc - ii ) experiment and the high energy @xmath4 collider will help us to probe the effects of @xmath2 .",
    "note that when discussing the effects of @xmath2 boson , we will not include the uncertainties induced by wave functions and scale @xmath40 , because the major objective of this work is searching for the possibility of new physics signal , rather than producing acute numerical results .",
    "similarly , the effects of the extra @xmath2 boson in @xmath14 are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdkk ] . in the left panel , it is clear that the position of sm prediction is on the top of the experimental data , although some parts of them overlap with each other .",
    "furthermore , the heavy @xmath2 contributions ( @xmath205 ) are not apparent due to the uncertainties of sm .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath189 , the ranges @xmath206 $ ] and @xmath207 $ ] will be excluded .",
    "we also plot the region ( edged by curve ) related to the direct @xmath3 asymmetry and the branching fraction , as shown in the right panel .",
    "note that the sm prediction is @xmath208 , but with a light @xmath2 the estimated range is to be @xmath209 after considering the constraint from the experimental data .",
    "it is concluded that for @xmath14 the future measurement of direct @xmath3 asymmetry will help us to search for the possible effect of a light @xmath2 , though its contribution to the branching fraction is polluted by the sm uncertainties .    at last , we shall discuss the @xmath2 effect on the @xmath3 symmetry parameters @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "for @xmath135 , as the weak phase of @xmath212 is very small , both @xmath210 and @xmath211 are not sensitive to the np . on the contrary , for @xmath14 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are sensitive to the extra leptophobic @xmath2 boson . in fig.[fig : bdkk2 ] , we plot the relations of @xmath210 ( right panel ) and @xmath211 ( left panel ) with varying @xmath189 from @xmath213 to @xmath214 , when @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",

    "in this work , we have studied the pure annihilation decays @xmath14 and @xmath135 in the sm and the family non - universal leptophobic @xmath2 model .",
    "although the sm predictions in the pqcd approach are in agreement with experimental data , the branching fraction of @xmath135 ( @xmath14 ) is a little bigger ( smaller ) than the lhcb result , which may indicate the survival space for a light @xmath2 boson .",

    "<S> taking into account the @xmath2 contribution , we find theoretical results for branching fractions can better accommodate the data . with the relevant data , we also derive a constraint on the parameter space for the @xmath2 . moreover , for the @xmath1 , both the direct and the mixing - induced @xmath3 asymmetry are sensitive to the couplings between @xmath2 and fermions in the parameter spaces constrained by data </S>",
    "<S> . the measurements at future experimental facilities , including the lhc - b , belle - ii and the proposed high energy @xmath4 collider , will provide us useful hints for direct searching for the light @xmath2 boson . </S>"
