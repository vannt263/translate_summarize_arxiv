    "the search for high - redshift supernovae has been extensively conducted mainly to determine cosmological parameters by the supernova cosmology project ( @xcite ) and the high - z supernova search team ( @xcite ) .",
    "high - redshift supernovae can also provide useful information on the star formation history in the universe .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been discovered up to @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , and the sn ia rate has been estimated up to @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the next generation space telescope , both sne ia and type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) will be observed through @xmath7 .",
    "the sn ii rate is directly connected with the star formation rate ( sfr ) , and the sn ia rate can also trace the sfr combined with a sn ia progenitor model . in a theoretical approach , the cosmic sn ia rate as a function of redshift has been constructed using the observed cosmic sfr ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter k98 ) .",
    "the cosmic sfr has been estimated observationally up to @xmath8 from uv and h@xmath9 luminosity densities with the help of spectral population synthesis models ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed cosmic sfr by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) shows a peak at @xmath1 and a sharp decrease to the present .",
    "however , uv luminosities which are converted to the sfrs may be affected by the dust extinction ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent updates of the cosmic sfr show some different features ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , one of which suggests that a peak lies around @xmath3 .    among the several attempts to calculate the cosmic sn ia rate using the observed cosmic sfr",
    ", k98 predicts that the cosmic sn ia rate drops at @xmath10 , because the sn ia occurrence depends on the metallicity . in their sn ia progenitor model , the accreting white dwarf ( wd ) blows strong winds to reach the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass limit ( @xcite , 1999b ) .",
    "if the iron abundance of the progenitors is as low as [ fe / h]@xmath11 , then the wind is too weak for sne ia to occur .",
    "this model successfully reproduces the observed chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood such as the evolution of the oxygen to iron ratio and the abundance distribution function of disk stars ( k98 ) .",
    "their finding that the occurrence of sne ia depends on the metallicity of the progenitor systems implies that the sn ia rate strongly depends on the history of the star formation and metal - enrichment .",
    "the universe is composed of different morphological types of galaxies and therefore the cosmic sfr is a sum of the sfrs for different types of galaxies . as each morphological type has a unique star formation history , we should decompose the cosmic sfr into the sfr belonging to each type of galaxy and calculate the sn ia rate for each type of galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we first construct the detailed evolution models for different types of galaxies which are compatible with the stringent observational constraints , and apply them to reproduce the cosmic sfr for two different environments , i.e. , clusters and field .",
    "secondly we confirm that the metallicity - dependent sn ia progenitor model , which has been already tested for the solar neighborhood , can explain the present supernova rates for all types of galaxies . finally combining the above sn ia model with the self - consistent galaxy models ,",
    "we calculate the sn ia rate history for each type of galaxy and predict the cosmic sn ia rate as a function of redshift .    in the next section",
    ", we describe our computational method of the galaxy evolution with our sn ia progenitor model . in section 3",
    ", we construct the star formation histories of spirals and ellipticals , and predict their supernova rate histories in section 4 . in section 5 , we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rates as a composite of different types of galaxies in clusters and field .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sections 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the progenitors of the majority of sne ia are most likely the ch mass wds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite for recent reviews ) , although the sub - ch mass models might correspond to some peculiar subluminous sne ia .",
    "the early time spectra of the majority of sne ia are in excellent agreement with the synthetic spectra of the ch mass models , while the spectra of the sub - ch mass models are too blue to be compatible with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the evolution of accreting wds toward the ch mass ,",
    "two scenarios have been proposed : one is a double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario , i.e. , merging of double c+o wds with a combined mass surpassing the ch mass limit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the other is a single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario , i.e. , accretion of hydrogen - rich matter via mass transfer from a binary companion ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the issue of dd versus sd is still debated ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , but theoretical modeling has indicated that the merging of wds does not make typical sne ia ( @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ) , and the lifetime of sne ia progenitors predicted by the dd scenario is too short to be compatible with the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood ( k98 ) .",
    "our sd scenario has two progenitor systems : one is a red - giant ( rg ) companion with the initial mass of @xmath12 and an orbital period of tens to hundreds days ( hachisu et al .",
    "1996 , 1999ab ) .",
    "the other is a near main - sequence ( ms ) companion with an initial mass of @xmath13 and a period of several tenths of a day to several days ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these progenitor systems ,",
    "the c+o wd accretes h - rich matter from the companion star at a sufficiently high rate ( @xmath14 yr@xmath15 ) to increase its mass to the ch mass through steady hydrogen burning .",
    "with such a rapid accretion , the wd blows optically thick strong winds that play a key role in stabilizing the mass transfer and avoiding a common envelope formation .",
    "the optically thick winds are driven by a strong peak of opal opacity at @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the opacity peak is due to iron lines , the wind velocity @xmath17 depends on the iron abundance [ fe / h ] ( k98 ; @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath17 is higher for larger [ fe / h ] .",
    "the metallicity effect on sne ia is clearly demonstrated by the size of the regions to produce sne ia in the diagram of the initial orbital period versus initial mass of the companion star ( see fig.2 of k98 ) .",
    "the sn ia regions are much smaller for lower metallicity because the wind becomes weaker .",
    "the wind velocity depends also on the luminosity @xmath18 of the wd .",
    "the more massive wd has a higher @xmath18 , thus blowing higher velocity winds ( hachisu et al .",
    "in order for the wind velocity to exceed the escape velocity of the wd near the photosphere , the wd mass should be larger than a certain critical mass for a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "this implies that the initial mass of the wd @xmath19 should already exceed that critical mass in order for the wd mass to grow to the ch mass .",
    "this critical mass is larger for smaller [ fe / h ] , reaching @xmath20 for [ fe / h ] @xmath21 ( fig.1 of k98 ) .",
    "here we should note that the relative number of wds with @xmath22 is quite small in close binary systems ( @xcite ) . and for @xmath23 , the accretion leads to collapse rather than sne ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that no sn ia occur at [ fe / h ] @xmath24 in our chemical evolution model .",
    "the lifetimes of sne ia ( i.e. , the lifetimes of the binary systems from the formation through the explosion ) are determined from the main - sequence lifetimes of the companion stars with the initial masses in the range @xmath25 . in our chemical evolution model ,",
    "we adopt @xmath26 and @xmath27 as a representative case .",
    "then @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the rg+wd system and @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the ms+wd system , as seen in figure 1 of k98 .",
    "the distribution function of the companion stars ( mass donors ) is assumed to be @xmath32 with the slope of @xmath33 , and normalized to unity at @xmath25 .",
    "this slope is determined from the distribution function of the initial mass of the companions which is taken from the observed mass ratio distribution in binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "the progenitors of sne ia are assumed to have main sequence masses in the range of @xmath34 and @xmath35 and form c+o wds .",
    "the total fraction of primary stars which eventually produce sne ia is denoted by @xmath36 ( see eq.[[eq : snia ] ] in section 2.2 for the exact definition of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 may depend on the binary fractions .",
    "if the binary fraction depends on the gas density in the star forming region , there should be a difference in @xmath36 between spirals and ellipticals ( we can expect the higher fraction for ellipticals )",
    ". however the number of low - mass x - ray binaries per unit blue luminosity appears to be almost the same between spirals and ellipticals ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which means that the binary fraction does not depend on the gas density in the star - forming region .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 may also depend on the metallicity .",
    "we have not included the metallicity dependence of the size of the sn ia region . according to the simulations of hachisu & kato ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the area in the orbital period - companion mass plane does not increase with the metallicity for the ms+wd systems , but does increase for the rg+wd systems .",
    "thus , only @xmath36 for the rg+wd systems @xmath37 may be larger for higher metallicity .",
    "however there is no significant difference between the mean iron abundances of progenitors for the rg+wd systems in ellipticals and spirals .",
    "thus , we determine the values of @xmath36 to reproduce the chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood , and adopt the best - fit values for all types of galaxies .",
    "( we also show the results for other @xmath36 parameters in appendix . )",
    "we search the parameter @xmath36 with the @xmath38 test for the [ o / fe]-[fe / h ] relation and the abundance distribution in the solar neighborhood , and get the allowed values of @xmath39 for the ms+wd systems and @xmath40 for the rg+wd systems under @xmath41 .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath42 and @xmath43 with the probability of more than @xmath44 ; the probability is as low as @xmath45 for @xmath46 which is determined from the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . ]",
    "( see appendix ) .",
    "the fraction of primary stars which eventually produce sne ia is given as functions of the companion s mass @xmath47 and the companion s lifetime ( i.e. , lifetime of sne ia progenitor @xmath48 ) as @xmath49 @xmath50 figure [ fig : rate ] shows @xmath51 ( upper panel ) and @xmath52 ( lower panel ) for the rg+wd and the ms+wd systems .",
    "in the lower panel , the solid and the dashed lines show the cases for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( solar ) , respectively .",
    "in the one - zone uniform model for the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood , the heavy elements in the metal - poor stars originate from the mixture of the sn ii ejecta of various progenitor masses .",
    "the abundances averaged over the progenitor masses of sne ii predicts [ o / fe ] @xmath55 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "later sne ia start ejecting mostly fe , so that [ o / fe ] decreases to @xmath56 around [ fe / h ] @xmath56 .",
    "the low - metallicity inhibition of sne ia predicts that the decrease in [ o / fe ] starts at [ fe / h ] @xmath57",
    ". such an evolution of [ o / fe ] well explains the observations ( k98 ) .",
    "we should note that some anomalous stars have [ o / fe ] @xmath58 0 at [ fe / h ] @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of such stars , however , is not in conflict with our sne ia models , but can be understood as follows : the formation of such anomalous stars ( and the diversity of [ o / fe ] in general ) indicates that the interstellar materials were not uniformly mixed but contaminated by only a few sne ii ( or even single sn ii ) ejecta .",
    "this is because the timescale of mixing was longer than the time difference between the supernova event and the next generation star formation .",
    "the iron and oxygen abundances produced by a single sn ii vary depending on the mass , energy , mass cut , and metallicity of the progenitor .",
    "relatively smaller mass sne ii ( @xmath59 ) and higher explosion energies tend to produce [ o / fe ] @xmath56 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those metal poor stars with [ o / fe ] @xmath56 may be born from the interstellar medium polluted by such sne ii .    the metallicity effect on sne",
    "ia can also be checked with the metallicity of the host galaxies of nearby sne ia .",
    "there has been no evidence that sne ia have occurred in galaxies with a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath11 , although host galaxies are detected only for one third of sne ia and the estimated metallicities of host galaxies are uncertain .",
    "three sne ia are observed in low - metallicity dwarf galaxies ; sn1895b and sn1972e in ngc 5253 , and sn1937c in ic 4182 .",
    "metallicities of these galaxies are estimated to be [ o / h ] @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "if [ o / fe ] @xmath56 as in the magellanic clouds , [ fe / h]@xmath62 and @xmath61 which are not so small . even if these galaxies have extremely sn ii like abundance as [ o / fe ] @xmath55 , [ fe / h ] @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( being higher than @xmath65 ) , respectively . since these host galaxies are blue ( @xmath66 for ngc 5253 and @xmath67 for ic 4182 according to rc3 catalog ) , the ms+wd systems are dominant progenitors for the present sne ia .",
    "the rate of sne ia originated from the ms+wd systems is not so sensitive to the metallicity as far as [ fe / h ] @xmath68 ( @xcite ) . even if [ fe / h ] @xmath63 in such blue galaxies , therefore , the sn ia rate is predicted to be similar to those in more metal - rich galaxies .",
    "futhermore , our sn ia model can well explain the diversity of sn ia luminosity , by assuming that the more luminous sne ia are produced from smaller @xmath19 because of the larger c / o ratio .",
    "observationally , the most luminous sne ia occur only in spirals , while both spirals and ellipticals are hosts for dimmer sne ia ( @xcite ) . in our progenitor model",
    ", the wd with small @xmath19 ( @xmath69 ) can reach the ch mass only when the companion stars is massive enough ( i.e. , @xmath48 is short enough ) to supply the necessary amount of mass ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus the brightest sne ia can occur only near the star forming region .",
    "the variation of the peak brightness of sne ia has been found to depend also on the location in the galaxy , i.e. , the diversity decreases toward the outer regions of the galaxy ( @xcite ) . in our model , this trend is due to the metallicity gradient of the galaxy . in the outer region ,",
    "the metallicity is so small that @xmath19 should be large enough to blow strong winds ; thus only dim sne ia appear .      a simplified model of the galactic chemical evolution is constructed with analytical equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion of primordial gas from a reservoir in a halo is assumed to form a galaxy . by assuming that the accretion per time @xmath70 ( the infall rate @xmath71 ) is proportional to the mass of the reservoir , we get the exponential form of the infall rate with a infall timescale @xmath72 as @xmath73 here we define the total baryon mass of the galaxy as the mass of the reservoir .",

    "<S> we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a composite of the supernova rates in spiral and elliptical galaxies . we include the metallicity effect on the evolution of type ia supernova ( sn ia ) progenitors , and construct detailed models for the evolutions of spiral and elliptical galaxies in clusters and field to meet the latest observational constraints . in the cluster environment </S>",
    "<S> , the synthesized cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) has an excess at @xmath0 corresponding to the early star burst in ellipticals and a shallower slope from the present to the peak at the redshift of @xmath1 compared with madau s plot . in the field environment </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that ellipticals form over a wide range of redshifts as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the synthesized cosmic sfr has a broad peak around @xmath3 , which is in good agreement with the observed one . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant cosmic sfrs lead to the following predictions for the cosmic sn ia rate : 1 ) the sn ia rate in spirals has a break at @xmath4 due to the low - metallicity inhibition of sne ia , regardless of clusters or field . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) at high redshifts , the sn ia rate has a strong peak around @xmath3 in clusters , whereas in field much lower rate is expected , reflecting the difference in the formation epochs of ellipticals . </S>"
