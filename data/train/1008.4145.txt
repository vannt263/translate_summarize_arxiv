    "recent progress in the study of qcd - like gauge theories has revealed that a confined phase can exist under certain conditions when one or more spatial directions are compactified and small @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , because a small compact direction in euclidean time gives rise to a deconfined phase for @xmath5 gauge theories at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is also intriguing , because one or more small compact directions give rise to a small effective coupling constant if the theory is asymptotically free .",
    "thus we now have four - dimensional field theories in which confinement holds , and holds under circumstances where semiclassical methods may be reliably applied . at present , there are two methods known for achieving this .",
    "the first method directly modifies the gauge action with terms nonlocal in the compact direction(s ) @xcite , while the second adds adjoint fermions with periodic boundary conditions in the compact direction(s ) @xcite , which is our subject here .",
    "confinement in @xmath5 gauge theories is associated with an unbroken global center symmetry , which is @xmath6 for @xmath5 .",
    "the order parameter for @xmath6 breaking in the compact direction is the polyakov loop , @xmath7 $ ] , which is the path - ordered exponential of the gauge field in the compact direction .",
    "the trace of @xmath3 in a representation @xmath8 represents the insertion of a heavy fermion in that representation into the system .",
    "unbroken @xmath6 symmetry implies @xmath9 in the confined phase , and correspondingly @xmath10 holds in the deconfined phase where @xmath6 symmetry is broken .",
    "in the case of adjoint fermions with periodic boundary conditions on @xmath0 , @xmath6 symmetry is restored if the circumference @xmath1 of @xmath2 is sufficiently small and the mass @xmath11 of the adjoint fermions is sufficiently light @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 is sufficiently small , the effective potential has a global minimum when the polyakov loop eigenvalues are uniformly spaced around the unit circle .",
    "this is the unique @xmath6-symmetric solution for @xmath3 .",
    "experience with phenomenological models @xcite suggests that in fact it is the constituent mass which is relevant in determining the size of the fermionic contribution to the effective potential for @xmath3 .    in order to explore the interrelationship of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", we use a generalization of nambu - jona lasinio models known as polyakov - nambu - jona lasinio ( pnjl ) models @xcite . in njl models ,",
    "a four - fermion interaction induces chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "there has been a great deal of work on njl models , both as phenomenological models for hadrons and as effective theories of qcd @xcite .",
    "njl models have been used to study hadronic physics at finite temperature , but they include only chiral symmetry restoration , and do not model deconfinement .",
    "this omission is rectified by the pnjl models , which include both chiral restoration and deconfinement .",
    "the earliest model of this type was derived from strong - coupling lattice gauge theory @xcite , but later work on continuum models have proven to be extremely powerful in describing the finite - temperature qcd phase transition @xcite . in pnjl models , fermions with njl couplings",
    "move in a nontrivial polyakov loop background , and the effects of gluons at finite temperature is modeled in a semiphenomenological way .",
    "we will develop a model of this type for both fundamental and adjoint fermions below .",
    "recent lattice simulations by cossu and delia @xcite have confirmed the existence of the small-@xmath1 confined region in @xmath13 lattice gauge theory with two flavors of adjoint fermions , and we will focus on this case in our analysis .",
    "even if the small-@xmath1 confined region exists and is accessible in lattice simulations , it is not necessarily the same phase as found for large @xmath1 .",
    "put slightly differently , we would like to know if the small-@xmath1 and large-@xmath1 confined regions are smoothly connected , and thus represent the same phase .",
    "our main result will be a phase diagram for adjoint periodic qcd for all values of @xmath1 , obtained using a pnjl model . on the way to this goal , we will use as tests of our model both standard qcd with fundamental fermions and adjoint qcd with the usual antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "our principal tool will be the effective potential for the chiral symmetry order parameter @xmath4 and the deconfinement order parameter @xmath3 . for a more detailed discussion , see reference @xcite .",
    "we take the fermionic part of the lagrangian of our pnjl model to be @xcite @xmath14+g_{d}\\left[\\det\\bar{\\psi}\\left(1-\\gamma_{5}\\right)\\psi+h.c.\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is associated with @xmath16 flavors of dirac fermions in the fundamental or adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath5 .",

    "the covariant derivative @xmath24 couples the fermions to a background polyakov loop via the component of the gauge field in the compact direction .",
    "it is generally convenient to use the language of finite temperature to describe both the case of finite temperature , @xmath25 , with antiperiodic boundary conditions , and the case of a periodic spatial direction , @xmath26 .",
    "the zero - temperature contribution to the fermionic effective potential is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a constituent mass , and the constant @xmath31 is the dimensionality of the color representation , @xmath32 for the fundamental and @xmath33 for the adjoint . the last term , representing a sum of one - loop diagrams , is regularized by three - dimensional momentum space cutoff , @xmath34 @xcite .    in pnjl models ,",
    "the finite - temperature contribution from the fermion determinant depends on the background polyakov loop .",
    "it is convenient to work in a gauge where the temporal component of the background gauge field , @xmath35 , is constant and diagonal .",
    "the covariant derivative then becomes @xmath36 .",
    "the one - loop free energy of fermions in a representation @xmath8 of @xmath5 gauge theory with zero chemical potential can be expanded in terms of modified bessel functions @xmath37 which is rapidly convergent for all values of the mass @xcite .",
    "the plus sign is used for periodic boundary conditions and minus for antiperiodic . in",

    "the ability to freely vary @xmath42 allows a clear connection between the large-@xmath1 and small-@xmath1 confining regions of the phase diagram .",

    "the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation of @xmath13 can be diagonalized by a gauge transformation and written as @xmath46 with two independent angles . with the use of @xmath47 symmetry , it is sufficient to consider the case where @xmath48 is real .",
    "thus we consider only diagonal , special - unitary matrices with real trace , which may be parametrized by taking @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , or @xmath52 $ ] with @xmath53 .",
    "the unique set of @xmath47-invariant eigenvalues are obtained for @xmath54 . for @xmath13 , we can write the gluonic effective potential in a high temperature expansion in terms of @xmath55 @xcite @xmath56 we will set the mass scale @xmath57 by requiring that @xmath58 yields the correct deconfinement temperature for the pure gauge theory , with a value of @xmath59 . this gives @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we stress that the mass parameter @xmath57 should not be interpreted as a gauge boson mass , nor do we limit ourselves to @xmath61 .",
    "the crucial feature of this potential is that for sufficiently large values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath62 , the potential leads to a @xmath6-symmetric , confining minimum for @xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand , for small values of @xmath62",
    ", the pure gauge theory will be in the deconfined phase .",
    "it will be important later that @xmath63 is a good representation of the gauge boson contribution for high temperatures ; in other pnjl models , the gauge boson contribution has sometimes been chosen so as to be valid over a more narrow range of temperatures .",
    "as a test of all the components of the effective potential we have assembled , we consider the case of two flavors of fundamental fermions at finite temperature . a very common choice of zero - temperature parameters for two degenerate light flavors is @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
