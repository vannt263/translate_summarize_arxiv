    "the pivotal role played by what is now called the abelian u(1 ) higgs model in the progress and the stimulus for new ideas in many areas of physics over the second half of the twentieth century need not be emphasized@xcite .",
    "ranging from phase transitions in condensed matter systems displaying quantum coherence phenomena such as superconductivity and superfluidity , through elementary particle physics with its issues of spontaneous and dynamical symmetry breaking , the origin of mass , colour confinement and the dual meissner effect , to cosmology and the evolution of the universe with the formation of textures of different dimensionalities all possibly within some inflationary scenario , and finally even m - theory to the extent that magnetic vortex solutions provided the first example of so - called bps states which are so crucial to the duality web of superstring theories , the abelian higgs model has proved to be sort of a precious treasure chest for tools in our quest of the secrets of the entire physical universe , cast away that we are on our little  speckle of dust \" .",
    "with dirac s monopole , magnetic vortices were also the first known states bearing witness to the wide - ranging role played by the topology of field configurations in classical and quantum field theories alike , thereby opening up yet another whole beautiful toolbox of mathematical physics .    in this latter respect , it seems to be _ de facto _ a well accepted working assumption  albeit not established in any strict mathematical sense  that all topologically non trivial solutions to the landau - ginzburg - higgs ( lgh ) equations are magnetic vortices of integer winding number in the order parameter represented by a spacetime dependent complex scalar field , @xmath0 indeed , in a space of infinite extent , finite energy configurations must necessarily be such that @xmath1 approaches its non vanishing constant vacuum expectation value at infinity , while single - valuedness of @xmath2 itself then allows only for a phase dependency of integer winding number @xmath3 at infinity , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the angular direction in a plane locally transverse to the vortex ) .",
    "continuity of @xmath2 throughout space then implies ( when @xmath6 ) that @xmath2 itself must vanish along at least one curve of dimension one at a finite distance which determines the location in three dimensional space of at least one vortex .",
    "since such configurations carry a non vanishing magnetic flux measured at infinity which is directly proportional to the winding number @xmath3 , they indeed correspond to magnetic vortices .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7 solution is the celebrated abrikosov ( anti)vortex of superconductors described by the landau - ginzburg equations@xcite , or equivalently the nielsen - olesen vortex of the abelian u(1 ) higgs model whose low energy effective relativistic dynamics is that of the bosonic string@xcite .",
    "higher winding number solutions with a single vortex are known as giant vortex states in superconductivity , and play an important role in the magnetization properties of mesoscopic superconductors@xcite .",
    "the above topological argument thus provides the classifying scheme for all possible vortex solutions ( of finite energy ) to the lgh equations in two ( infinite flat ) dimensions , in terms of the then necessarily integer winding number of the map from the circle at planar infinity onto the u(1 ) gauge group of phase transformations of the scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , under both the assumptions of finite energy and of an arbitrary collection of discrete zeroes of arbitrary positive integer degree in the order parameter @xmath2 , it has been shown@xcite that for a specific critical value of the scalar field self - coupling @xmath8 , a critical value which for definiteness we shall refer to as @xmath9 ( the second notation being motivated by the relation to vortices of integer winding number ) , all solutions to these equations are given in terms of a collection of such magnetic vortices each of whose positive or negative integer winding number equals , in absolute value , the degree of the zero in @xmath2 associated to that vortex .",
    "furthermore , still precisely for that critical value @xmath10 of the scalar self - coupling , the value for the energy of each of these solutions saturates the bomogolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld ( bps ) lower bound@xcite proportional to its total integer winding number , showing that they in fact satisfy first - order differential equations from which their second - order equations of motion follow , a tell - tale sign for some underlying supersymmetry .",
    "the stability of these magnetic vortices with respect to fluctuations within the same topological classes of configurations has also been studied for arbitrary values of the scalar self - coupling@xcite . for a coupling less than the critical one , @xmath11 , and a specified integer winding number @xmath3 ,",
    "all such giant vortex states have been shown to be stable , thus suggesting that an arbitrary collection of vortices of total winding number @xmath3 would then collapse into a single giant vortex with that winding number @xmath3 . in contradistinction , for a coupling larger than the critical one , @xmath12 ,",
    "only the @xmath7 fundamental vortices are stable , while giant vortices with @xmath13 fall apart into a collection of @xmath14 individual fundamental vortices each of winding number @xmath15 . finally specifically at the critical coupling , @xmath16 , all configurations corresponding to all possible same sign integer partitions of the total winding number @xmath3 are of equal energy , since they all saturate the same bps lower bound irrespective of the vortices relative positions@xcite .",
    "the physical understanding of these properties stems from a subtle interplay between , on the one hand , the repulsive ( resp .",
    "attractive ) magnetic force acting between vortices whose winding numbers are of the same ( resp .",
    "opposite ) sign  much like the force between parallel or antiparallel magnetic dipoles  and , on the other hand , the attractive scalar force related to the tendency of the system to relax to configurations whose condensate value @xmath1 is as close as possible to the constant non vanishing expectation value which minimizes the scalar field potential energy ( the ratio of the latter form of energy density to the former magnetic energy density is precisely given by the scalar self - coupling ) .",
    "in particular exactly at the critical coupling , @xmath16 , the two types of forces balance each other , and vortices do not interact with one another whatever their relative positions@xcite . clearly , these very properties also explain why for type ii superconductors , whose self - coupling is by definition larger than the critical value , @xmath12 , vortices tend to organize themselves into a triangular lattice of abrikosov vortices , whose lattice constant is a function of the scalar self - coupling , as is beautifully confirmed experimentally@xcite .    in spite of the elegant physical insight offered by these results ,",
    "the implicit assumptions on which they rely may not be satisfied by all solutions to the lgh equations , including those of finite energy .",
    "indeed , it is only in the case of the infinite plane that the restriction to configurations of finite energy implies that @xmath1 must reach its vacuum expectation value at infinity in a continuous manner in all angular directions , and it is this latter fact together with single - valuedness of @xmath2 which then requires the winding number to be integer .",
    "however , as soon as planar domains of finite spatial extent are considered , a situation which is of interest not only to actual superconductors but clearly also to other systems with phase transitions or topological states confined to finite spatial volumes , the value of @xmath1 on the boundary need no longer be the vacuum expectation value , thereby allowing _ a priori _ even vanishing values , and thus also possibly circumventing the apparent restriction to integer winding numbers only .",
    "what then becomes of the topological classification above ?",
    "moreover , another assumption always implicit in the results recalled above@xcite is that the order parameter @xmath2 is such that both the corresponding function @xmath17 as defined in ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is positive everywhere , and that if it does vanish , it does so only at discrete points in the plane at which the phase value @xmath18 is then not defined .",
    "however , even though any complex number may always be parametrized as in ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) in terms of its positive amplitude and its phase defined only modulo @xmath19 , when it comes to a single - valued continuous complex _ function _ defined on the plane ( or any riemann surface ) and parametrized as in ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) , there appears a non trivial correlation between the sign of the real function @xmath17which may possibly change  and the lack of single - valuedness inherent to the phase parametrization in terms of @xmath18 , this correlation being best highlighted by considering the transport of the single - valued order parameter @xmath2 along any closed _",
    "finite _ contour .",
    "clearly , this last remark is topological by nature , and thus provides the means to address the question raised above with regards to a topological classification of solutions in finite planar domains .",
    "note also that this approach takes the contour of the circle at planar infinity used in the usual argument , to bring it back at any point in the plane at a finite distance , thereby providing a finer - grained tool to assess the topological properties of solutions to the lgh equations .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it was recently pointed out@xcite that in finite planar domains , beyond the usual vortex configurations , the lgh equations also possess annular vortex solutions of finite energy and integer winding number , whose order parameter @xmath2 vanishes not only at a given point , but also on a series of concentric closed curves surrounding that point as well as one another in an almost regular radial pattern and at which the function @xmath17 does indeed alternate in sign .",
    "each such successive annulus is related to a non vanishing closed current flow always running in the same direction , responsible for part of the total magnetic flux and whose kinetic energy contributes to the total energy of the configuration an almost identical amount , thereby leading to an infinite value in the case of an annular vortex in the infinite plane .",
    "hence , these specific properties of such annular vortices explain why they could not be uncovered through the general theorems@xcite restricted to only finite energy solutions in the infinite plane and such that the function @xmath17 always remains positive and vanishes only at discrete points with some integer degree .",
    "finally , and this very point lies at the hear of the whole matter , the above topological argument does not take into account the built - in u(1 ) local gauge invariance of the lgh equations which compounds even further the issue of the lack of single - valuedness of the function @xmath18 for non zero winding number in correlation with the sign of the function @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , in the same way that for @xmath6 @xmath18 defines a multicovering of the plane as indicated for instance by its asymptotic value @xmath20 , it will turn out that @xmath17 must be considered to define a double sheeted covering of the plane , while nonetheless the order parameter @xmath21 remains continuous , regular and single - valued throughout spacetime .",
    "thus for example , a single giant vortex with @xmath6 is associated to a degenerate double covering of the plane in which the two sheets meet at a single point ",
    "namely , the position of the vortex , at which @xmath22 varies as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 measuring the distance to the vortex axis , while the double sheeted covering remains nevertheless regular , continuous and differentiable everywhere , with the function @xmath22 having opposite signs on each sheet .",
    "this paper provides a topological classification of solutions to the lgh equations , which we believe should also prove to be complete since it is based on the fine - grained topological consideration mentioned above .",
    "clearly , when accounting for the possibility that the real function @xmath17 may _ a priori _ take negative as well as positive values in a continuous fashion , beyond the ordinary and annular vortex configurations of integer winding number @xmath3 there also exist vortices of half - integer winding number @xmath3 such that the order parameter function @xmath17 changes sign an odd number of times when transported around some given closed contours surrouding such vortices .",
    "more specifically , it will be shown that vortices of half - integer winding number , which shall be referred to as half - integer vortices for short , have the particularity of always being bound onto the edges of an odd number of two dimensional domain walls ( when viewed in three dimensions ) which end on such vortices , and inside of which the order parameter @xmath2 also vanishes on a two dimensional surface .",
    "the same type of configuration may in fact also occur for integer vortices ( _ i.e. _ whose winding number is integer ) , in which case the number of such domain walls must be even .",
    "usual isolated integer vortex configurations are thus a particular case of the latter type , with a vanishing number of domains walls ending on each of the vortices . hence ,",
    "when viewed in a plane locally transverse to any such solution , integer and half - integer vortices are characterized by having the order parameter vanish not only at the position of the vortex , but also along an even or odd number of continuous lines emanating from the vortex itself , in clear contrast again with the assumptions of the usual general theorems .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a finite planar domain , such vortices bound onto the edges of domain walls may also be surrounded by an annular pattern of successive closed current flows extending up to the boundary , in exactly the same manner as already described in the case of isolated integer vortices . clearly , when present , such domain walls are associated to the branch cuts of the double sheeted covering of the plane which is defined by the function @xmath17 .",
    "being bound onto the edges of domain walls , such vortex configurations also display yet another remarkable property .",
    "even though the order parameter @xmath2 vanishes inside the domain wall , close to the edge onto which the vortex is bound a non vanishing closed current flow must quantum tunnel through the domain wall , in order to entirely surround the location of the vortex and contribute the required amount of magnetic flux . in the context of superconductors ,",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of the josephson effect for s - i - s junctions@xcite .",
    "what is a distinctive feature of the integer and half - integer vortices bound onto the edges of domain walls however , is that such a quantum tunnel current appears within a same single superconductor simply across a surface of vanishing order parameter whose location within the material could be anywhere and may also vary in time .    since domain walls are regions of space in which the order parameter @xmath1 takes values which differ from its vacuum expectation value , they necessarily contribute condensation energy to the system . in first approximation and for sufficiently extended domain walls ,",
    "this contribution is expected to be proportional to their length .",
    "indeed , their thickness is essentially constant since it is governed by a specific parameter of the lgh equations , namely the superconducting coherence length @xmath25 , or the inverse of the higgs boson mass @xmath26 in a particle physics parlance ( see section [ sect2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , in the case of spatially bounded domains , such domain walls may extend all the way to the boundary of the domain , and lead to finite energy configurations nonetheless .",
    "on the other hand in the case of an infinite spatial extension of the system , these domain walls must necessarily be of finite extent in order to lead to solutions of finite energy .",
    "in other words , in such a case , these domain walls must themselves end on some integer or half - integer vortex within the infinite volume of the sample .",
    "such considerations thus lead to the following general picture for all the configurations which solve the lgh equations .",
    "the basic entities in terms of which these solutions may be built up are , on the one hand , @xmath27-domain walls , and on the other hand , annular current flows . by a @xmath27-domain wall ,",
    "we mean a domain wall which ends on a half - integer vortex of winding number @xmath28 or @xmath29 , namely a @xmath27-vortex , but whose other edge may or may not be bound to another @xmath27-vortex , as the case may be . by an annular current flow ,",
    "we mean a closed current flow carrying no winding number , which may be placed around a given vortex but then in combination with other such annular flows in the radially outward concentric pattern described previously , and which then extends all the way to the boundary of the spatial domain ( such configurations are thus excluded in the case of an unbounded domain , since their energy would be infinite ) .",
    "indeed , any possible vortex configuration of the types described above may be viewed as being constructed from these basic building blocks , in exactly the same way that until now isolated giant vortices with @xmath13 were used to be viewed as a collection of @xmath14 individual abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortices stacked on top of one another . of course",
    ", this is also consistent with the point of view of the double sheeted covering of the plane advocated in this paper .",
    "such a collection of isolated giant vortices with @xmath13 defines a double covering in which subsets of the points at which the two sheets meet have coalesced into single points . in the same spirit , the general solutions including half - integer vortices and domain walls may thus be viewed as configurations in which some of these points and coalesced subsets of points have been split into branch cuts in the double covering of the plane , leading _ in fine _ to the basic entities considered above .    thus for example , a @xmath30 vortex may be obtained from three @xmath27-domain walls with @xmath28 which share a common edge , while the @xmath27-domain walls themselves could or could not be stacked on top of one another .",
    "furthermore , each of these @xmath27-domain walls could or could not end on another @xmath27-vortex with either @xmath28 or @xmath29 , but they must do so in the case of a spatial domain of infinite extent in order to obtain configurations of finite energy . indeed , this is the only constraint which must be imposed on the construction , which implies that @xmath27-domain walls can never extend up to infinity for unbounded spatial domains , while they may extend up to the boundary of finite ones .",
    "since the total winding numbers of such bound @xmath27-domain walls only take the values @xmath31 , the fact that only such basic entities are allowed in the case of unbounded spatial domains is in full agreement with the restriction to only integer total winding numbers at spatial infinity as implied by the usual topological argument recalled earlier .",
    "nevertheless , the assumptions of the usual theorems@xcite are evaded since the order parameter then vanishes not only at discrete points in the plane but also along segments of finite length , thereby allowing for the existence of these new types of configurations built up from bound @xmath27-domain walls ( annular current flows are excluded for unbounded domains ) . in contradistinction in the case of a planar domain of finite extent ,",
    "the total winding number need not be integer , but could also take half - integer values , since a @xmath27-domain wall may extend all the way to the boundary of the planar domain without being bound to another @xmath27-vortex , leading to a finite energy configuration nonetheless .",
    "furthermore in this case , such configurations may also be combined with annular current flows surrouding vortices and extending up to the boundary of the finite domain .",
    "the characterization described above of all solutions to the lgh equations , which is a direct consequence of the finer - grained topological analysis based on any coutour at a finite distance in contrast with the usual argument , also raises the issue of the stability and lowest energy configuration of bound @xmath27-domain walls .",
    "given the fact , recalled previously , that magnetic vortices whose winding numbers are of the same ( resp .",
    "opposite ) sign repel ( resp .",
    "attract ) each other , while any deviation from its vacuum expectation value in the order parameter @xmath2 induces an attractive scalar force , one should expect that the bound @xmath27-domain wall binding two @xmath27-vortices of opposite winding numbers @xmath28 and @xmath29 would collapse , in its lowest energy state , to a @xmath32 configuration without any zero in the order parameter . on the other hand , the same issue in the case of bound @xmath27-domain walls binding two @xmath27-vortices with the same winding number",
    "@xmath33 is far less obvious example briefly described previously and assuming that these bound @xmath27-domain walls do not collapse into abrikosov vortices , one should expect for this reason that in the infinite domain case the lowest energy configuration for the @xmath30 vortex is obtained when the three @xmath27-domain walls are not stacked on top of one another , but rather are spread out into a maximally symmetric star - like pattern with an angular opening of 120@xmath34 between each , the complete state then having a total winding number @xmath35 ( see however section [ subsect3.1 ] ) . ] .",
    "given the natural tension built into such vortex and domain wall states , their energy must increase with their curvature or bending , so that the lowest energy configurations are expected to be straight vortices and domain walls .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out above , for sufficiently large separation the energy of such states must also grow essentially linearly with the distance between the two @xmath27-vortices , @xmath27-domains behaving very much like rubber bands in such a regime because of the condensation energy stored in the domain wall .",
    "hence , it is only when the two @xmath27-vortices have a non vanishing overlap that the competition between the repulsive and attractive forces acting on them could be such that the equilibrium lowest energy configuration would be reached for some specific non vanishing separation rather than a fully collapsed state .",
    "the possible overlap between vortices depends on their size , which is governed by yet another parameter of the lgh equations , namely the meissner penetration length @xmath36 , or the inverse of the gauge boson mass @xmath37 in a particle physics parlance ( see section [ sect2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the ratio of this latter length scale to that which determines the width of domain walls is directly related to the value of the scalar self - coupling .",
    "consequently , one would expect that there might exist some critical value @xmath38 of the scalar self - coupling marking the boundary between , on the one hand , unstable bound @xmath27-domain walls which would always collapse to @xmath7 ano vortices whatever the separation between the bound @xmath27-vortices , and , on the other hand , stable bound @xmath27-domain walls which would stabilize into configurations such that the domain wall is streched to some finite length .",
    "in fact , given the situation which applies to the stability of integer vortices against fluctuations which are also of integer winding number@xcite , one would expect that it is for values of the scalar self - coupling @xmath39 larger than this critical value @xmath38 that the latter occurrence would be realized .",
    "furthermore for the same reason , it may even be possible that the two critical values @xmath40 and @xmath38 , thus characterizing the stability properties of isolated integer vortices and of half - integer vortices bound by domain walls , should be equal to one another , and thus be equal to the value @xmath10 for which the usual isolated integer vortices also saturate the bps bounds .",
    "such considerations thus also raise the possibility that the @xmath7 ano vortex could be unstable against splitting into two @xmath33 vortices bound onto the edges of a bound @xmath27-domain wall with @xmath7 , and which would stabilize from one another at some specific non vanishing distance whose value would depend on that of the scalar self - coupling .",
    "even though some arguments and indicative results will be presented concerning this issue , no conclusion can be drawn at this stage unfortunately , since it requires a full - fledged dedicated numerical analysis which still needs to be completed .",
    "obviously , this specific point , and in particular the value for the possible equilibrium distance as a function of the scalar self - coupling , is of great interest , for instance , to the physical properties of magnetic vortices in superconductors .",
    "for example , given a value for that coupling such that the ano vortex would be split , the abrikosov lattice acquires a fine - grained structure in which the centers of all bound @xmath27-domain walls still define the usual triangular lattice , but with all individual bound @xmath27-domain walls then all parallel to one another and aligned with one of the three symmetry axes of the fundamental triangular lattice cell , as suggested by symmetry and minimal energy considerations .",
    "the above analysis , based on the fine - grained topological argument involving closed contours at any finite distance , has thus unravelled quite an unexpectedly rich classification of vortex , domain wall and annular current flow configurations ( the latter only in bounded spatial domains ) of integer and half - integer winding numbers , solving the lgh equations and extending the well established isolated vortex solutions .",
    "such states can all be built out of some basic entities bound and stacked together , namely the @xmath27-domain wall and the annular current flow in the case of bounded spatial domains , and the bound @xmath27-domain walls in unbounded spatial domains .",
    "even though the bound @xmath27-domain walls of winding numbers @xmath7 may not be stable against collapse into the @xmath7 ano vortices for some regimes of scalar self - coupling , nevertheless the mere existence of these fluctuation modes of bound @xmath27-domain walls with winding numbers @xmath31 solving the lgh equations , must have important consequences with regards to the dynamical properties of systems described by the lgh equations when coupled to external sources of electromagnetic disturbances , the first example in point being again obviously superconductors .",
    "the integer and half - integer winding number configurations bound by domain walls considered in this paper are also characterized by specific cut structures in the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and a double sheeted covering of the plane or a finite domain of it ( see section [ subsect2.4 ] ) .",
    "such cuts however , have no bearing whatsoever on the physical consistency of these configurations , since not only does the order parameter @xmath2 remain single - valued , regular and continuous throughout spacetime , but also it is only @xmath41 which is a gauge invariant physical observable , measuring in the context of superconductivity for example , the local ( relative ) density of cooper pairs , and in the particle physics context , the local condensation of the scalar field . as will become clearer",
    "in the course of the analysis , it is the u(1 ) gauge invariance properties of the system which provide the essential guarantee for the physical consistency and existence of half - integer winding number and domain wall solutions to the lgh equations .    in recent years , similar half - integer and fractional winding number topological configurations",
    "have in fact also been discussed within the framework of models other than the abelian u(1 ) higgs model , which could possibly have applications in high temperature superconductors and superfluids@xcite , in the qcd confinement problem@xcite , and for so - called alice strings@xcite in models beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "what distinguishes all these other instances of fractional winding number from the half - integer vortices discussed in this paper , is that these other models possess some spontaneously broken _ non abelian _ internal symmetry , whether global or locally gauged , such that when taken around a closed contour the matter fields of these systems end up pointing in a different direction in the representation space of their internal symmetry .",
    "what is remarkable with the present half - integer vortices is that a similar mechanism is at work in spite of having only an abelian u(1 ) gauged symmetry , by carefully keeping track , when taken around closed contours , of the possible change of sign in @xmath17 as well as its lack of single - valuedness in correlation with that of the phase parameter @xmath18 , while the order parameter @xmath2 itself remains nonetheless single - valued throughout space .",
    "as will become clear hereafter , this particular feature is achieved through the u(1 ) gauge invariance properties of the considered system and the correlation which exists between its gauge dependent variables .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the general equations of the abelian u(1 ) higgs model will be considered , to lead to the topological classification of integer and half - integer vortices .",
    "section [ sect3 ] then particularizes to the two dimensional case , namely the plane transverse to such solutions , to discuss specific limits and properties related to the possible bps bounds these solutions could saturate .",
    "single half - vortex solutions in finite disks and annuli are then considered in section [ sect4 ] , including the results of some preliminary numerical simulations .",
    "similar issues are then addressed in section [ sect5 ] in the case of the bound @xmath27-domain wall , including some preliminary indicative numerical results as to the possible instability of the @xmath42 vortex .",
    "finally , open issues and further outlook onto possible consequences and applications of these topological configurations of half - integer winding number of the abelian u(1 ) higgs model are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "in particle physics units , such that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46@xmath47 and @xmath48 being the vacuum electric and magnetic permitivities , respectively  the abelian u(1 ) higgs model is defined by the following action ) , thus raising many further issues of interest which are beyond the scope of this work . in particular , in the same way that the low energy effective dynamics of the ano vortex is described by the nambu - goto action@xcite , the same dynamics for such domain walls and those considered in this paper is necessarily also provided by the nambu - goto action extended to world - volumes of the appropriate dimension . in the same vein , one could also consider possible generalizations to some complex @xmath49-form coupled to a real @xmath50-form with a spontaneously broken local symmetry .",

    "nevertheless , a translation from one choice of units to the other is straightforward enough , for which the rules are given hereafter .",
    "normalizing the scalar field @xmath63representing the cooper pair wave function  to its vacuum expectation value  namely the square - root of the bcs condensate in the bulk in the absence of any magnetic field , the corresponding action is given by@xcite @xmath64\\right\\},\\ ] ] where now all quantities are expressed in s.i .",

    "note how these two length scales indeed measure the relative contributions to the effective action above , and thus also to the associated energy , of the magnetic and condensate energy densities .",

    "however , also for reasons advocated in ref.@xcite , when considering time dependent configurations or situations involving electric fields as well , the usual equations can no longer be applicable , since in particular the usual first london equation , @xmath152 ( rather than the covariant one above , @xmath153 ) , implies that superconductors can not sustain electric fields in static configurations , in clear contradiction with lorentz covariance . another way to realize that the usual lg equations can not be lorentz covariant is to consider the non relativistic limit in which the parameter @xmath154 is taken to infinity . since in s.i .",
    "units electric fields are measured in units of @xmath155 relative to magnetic fields @xmath74 , in that limit both any time as well as any electric field dependencies decouple from the above equations , which then also reduce again to the usual time independent non covariant lg equations .",

    "note however that the solutions which are described in this paper are static ones , in the absence of any electric field , and thus solve in fact also the usual non covariant lg equations coupled to maxwell s equations for magnetic fields , even though these states in fact define lorentz covariant configurations solving the lgh equations when subjected to arbitrary lorentz boosts acting from their rest frame .",
    "the advantage of having separated the system of coupled equations through the organization just described is not only that first one needs to solve only for the quantities @xmath22 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and only then for the phase variable @xmath133 through the knowledge of the electric and magnetic fields and their associated gauge potentials .",
    "more importantly perhaps , for obvious physics reasons the quantities @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 are in fact gauge invariant variables , directly amenable to physical observation , at least in principle , which is a property also shared by the electric and magnetic fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 only .",
    "indeed , u(1 ) gauge transformations of the field variables are given by , @xmath159 so that @xmath160 where @xmath161 is thus an arbitrary local function which is regular throughout spacetime . as was discussed above , the real function @xmath22 is defined only up to an overall sign whose choice , however , leaves all the above equations invariant as it should , and which indeed does not lead to any physical consequence .",
    "nevertheless , this choice of overall sign in @xmath22 is also correlated to a constant shift by @xmath162 in @xmath133 , again without consequences for physical observables .",
    "this correlated arbitrariness in both @xmath22 and @xmath133 is then compounded further in the case of @xmath133 because of the u(1 ) gauge symmetries of the system , which induce arbitrary spacetime dependent shifts in that variable in correlation with specific transformations in the gauge potential @xmath145 . in particular , note that the equations ( [ eq : theta1 ] ) or ( [ eq : theta2 ] ) and ( [ eq : theta3 ] ) display this correlation explicitly through their manifest gauge invariance .",
    "consequently , except for the choice of overall sign in the function @xmath22 , which is without physical significance , all the gauge dependency of the system resides in the variables @xmath133 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 . the remaining variables , namely @xmath22except for its overall sign , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath95 and @xmath94 are all gauge invariant quantities , whose determination through the above equations is thus decoupled from that of the gauge dependent variables .",
    "hence the advantage in using the procedure outlined above for the resolution of the coupled system of equations .",
    "in fact , as will be discussed in the next section , the u(1 ) local gauge freedom is such that there always exists a choice of gauge for which the function @xmath133 is then uniquely determined in terms of a specific non regular function @xmath165 which completely encodes the entire topological vortex structure of a given configuration , and in terms of which the gauge potential @xmath145 is then uniquely constructed from ( [ eq : theta3 ] ) as @xmath166 . hence indeed , through an appropriate choice of gauge associated to a specific vortex configuration in spacetime , only the lgh and inhomogeneous maxwell equations ( [ eq : lg ] ) and ( [ eq : j ] ) remain to be solved for the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath110 subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions .    to conclude ,",
    "let us also make the important following point . even though the currents @xmath143 and @xmath144 are gauge invariant , they are not directly amenable to physical observation , since they are so only through the electromagnetic current density @xmath167 .",
    "hence , it is only at those points in spacetime where @xmath22 does not vanish that the current @xmath168 is well - defined , while at those locations where @xmath22 does vanish , it may well be that this current possesses singularities just mild enough to be screened by the vanishing order parameter @xmath63 .",
    "as we shall see , this is precisely what happens not only at the location of vortices , but also on the domain walls ending on them .",
    "in fact , the expressions in ( [ eq : littlej1 ] ) and ( [ eq : littlej2 ] ) are already indicative of the logarithmic cut structures that may appear in @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath22 and @xmath133 at the zeroes of the order parameter @xmath63 in a way which depends on its winding number at these points .",

    "let us now apply the fine - grained topological analysis described in the introduction to the general framework which has been set - up so far .",

    "let us first restrict to time independent configurations in the planar case .",
    "in other words , we assume that the system has been dimensionally reduced to two flat space dimensions , with the time independent fields dependent only on the two coordinates of that plane , the magnetic field @xmath95 purely transverse to that plane and the electric field @xmath94 and charge distribution @xmath143 vanishing . choosing coordinates on the plane ",
    "normalized to the length scale @xmath36which are either cartesian , with @xmath194 , @xmath195 , or polar , with @xmath196 , @xmath197 and the specific evaluation @xmath198 , it is useful to introduce the complex combinations @xmath199    let us now consider a specific collection of @xmath200 vortices described as follows .",
    "each of these vortices , labelled by @xmath201 , has integer or half - integer winding number @xmath202 , @xmath203 being thus an even or odd integer , respectively .",
    "the total winding number of the configuration is thus @xmath204 with @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "in addition , each of these vortices has a position in the plane corresponding to the complex parameter @xmath207 . in order to construct the function @xmath165 associated to this vortex configuration ,",
    "let us also introduce for each value of @xmath201 a collection of @xmath203 complex functions @xmath208 labelled by @xmath209 and dependent only on the complex variable @xmath210 .",
    "then , a choice of function @xmath211 which reproduces all the contour integrals associated to this vortex configuration is given by the following expression , @xmath212,\\ ] ] where a specific evaluation of the complex logarithmic function is to be chosen ( for example with its branch cut along the real negative axis in the plane , namely at @xmath213 for @xmath214 ) .",
    "the meaning of this construction is as follows .",
    "the introduction of the index @xmath215 taking a total of @xmath216 values is in fact related to the interpretation discussed in the introduction which views all possible configurations as built up from @xmath27-vortices and @xmath27-domain walls which are combined and stacked on top of one another .",
    "each value for the index @xmath215 thus refers to each such @xmath27-vortex as a basic building block , with in particular the corresponding function @xmath208 specifying the position in the plane @xmath217 of the logarithmic branch cut in the quantum phase @xmath218 which is associated to that particular @xmath27-vortex and whose branch point is at the position of that vortex .",
    "however , note that one may also write , up to some specific integer multiple of @xmath129 to be added on the r.h.s . ,",
    "@xmath219\\ + \\ \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k=1}^k\\sum_{n_k=1}^{n_k } \\left[\\theta_{k , n_k}(z)+\\theta^*_{k , n_k}(z^*)\\right].\\ ] ] obviously , since the double sum on @xmath220 and @xmath215 in the r.h.s . of this expression defines a real function @xmath221 which trivially satisfies the equation @xmath189 , this term may be gauged away altogether , leaving over only the first simple sum over @xmath220 . in other words ,",
    "the positions of the different logarithmic branch cuts in the function @xmath218 may be moved around in the plane @xmath217 through arbitrary gauge transformations ; only their branch points are fixed at the @xmath27-vortices locations . in particular , these branch cuts may be chosen to lie exactly along the lines of vanishing order parameter within the domain walls that may exist .",
    "hence , when taking that degree of freedom into account which allows to gauge away all functions @xmath208 , there is no loss of generality in the following specific choice , for instance , for the function @xmath165 associated to such an arbitrary vortex configuration , @xmath222\\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "e^{i\\theta_0}=\\prod_{k=1}^k\\left [ \\frac{z - z_k}{z^*-z^*_k}\\right]^{-l_k/2}. \\label{eq : theta0}\\ ] ]    as a particular example , consider a single vortex of winding number @xmath3 at the center of the plane .",
    "one then has @xmath223 so that the order parameter takes the general form @xmath224 having chosen to work with the angular range @xmath198 , clearly the phase factor @xmath225 of this configuration has a branch cut at @xmath213 starting at the origin , while @xmath226 must then change sign on that branch cut for a half - integer winding number @xmath3 .",
    "a similar discussion applies in general , by considering the neighbourhood of any vortex in the plane .",
    "hence , whenever half - integer vortices are present  which , as discussed in the introduction , should indeed be the generic situation , these branch cut properties show that the function @xmath22 is in fact defined over a double covering of the plane , or a finite domain of it in the case of a bounded superconductor , with branch points at the positions of these vortices and branch cuts on those lines on which the order parameter vanishes within the domain walls which are bound to these vortices .",
    "the function @xmath226 then changes sign on these branch cuts , in such a way that it be continuous on the specific double sheeted covering of the plane which is associated to the considered configuration of bound vortices and domain walls .",
    "clearly , the same general picture also applies to integer vortices bound onto domain walls .",
    "it is only in the case of isolated integer vortices , thus not bound onto the edges of any domain walls  namely , the only situation thought to be possible until now , that the function @xmath226 is in fact continuously single - valued on the plane @xmath217 itself , rather than on some double covering of it , in which case it is indeed justified to assume that it be always positive ( or negative ) everywhere , with the exception of isolated points where it vanishes .",
    "nonetheless , given the arbitrary overall sign for the function @xmath226 , it remains more appropriate , even in such a case , to still view that function as being defined on a double sheeted covering of the @xmath217 plane in which the branch cuts between the two sheets have degenerated in a continuous fashion into single points which then correspond to the positions of the isolated integer vortices .",
    "hence by allowing all the degrees of freedom hidden in the polar parametrization of the order parameter , @xmath227 , to manifest themselves in a way made consistent by the u(1 ) gauge invariance of the system , we see that the general solution to the lgh equations is associated to a specific double covering of the plane or a finite domain of it , in the manner just described . in particular ,",
    "the unspecified overall sign of the function @xmath22 is then also seen to correspond to a choice of sheet in this double sheeted covering of the plane . when only isolated integer vortices are involved , these two sheets become almost disconnected by touching only at isolated points , thereby allowing the sign of @xmath22 to be fixed to remain either positive ( or negative ) as has always been assumed implicitly until now .",
    "but when domain walls are involved as well , then necessarily the two sheets become intertwined in a topologically non trivial manner precisely along these domain walls .",
    "finally , in the case of a planar domain of finite extent , some of the branch cuts in @xmath22 may extend all the way up to the boundary of the domain , and this general picture is compounded even further by the possibility of annular current flows surrouding the vortices , and thus adding further concentric closed branch cut structures in an almost periodic fashion to the double covering of the planar domain , with the function @xmath22 changing sign at the boundaries of successive annular flows .    as a last remark concerning the function @xmath165 as constructed above for time independent planar configurations , note that it satisfies the equation @xmath228 .",
    "hence in such a situation the vortex gauge fixing condition ( [ eq : gaugefixing ] ) reduces to the condition that @xmath229 , namely @xmath230 . for an axially symmetric time independent configuration , we then have the coulomb - london gauge fixing condition @xmath231 .",
    "let us now return to the general situation of a collection of integer and half - integer vortices bound onto the edges of a collection of domain walls , all in a time dependent fashion and moving in a three dimensional space .",
    "in such a case , it is possible to define a curvilinear system of coordinates associated to a specific foliation of spacetime , such that two of the coordinates define spacelike surfaces which are locally transverse to each of the vortices throughout space , with the third spacelike coordinate locally transverse to these surfaces , and finally the fourth timelike coordinate transerve  in terms of the minkowski metric  to all three spacelike coordinates . in other words , at each instant in time it is possible to view the vortex system as being obtained from the previous planar description , by appropriately bending these planes , and by stacking them on top of one another in a transverse direction in such a manner that all vortices and domain walls remain continuous throughout space .",
    "the coordinates in the planes locally transverse to all vortices then play the same role as the cartesian or polar coordinates considered in the planar case above .",
    "hence , it is possible to construct again the function @xmath165 in this general case using exactly the same functional expression as above , but this time in terms of the curvilinear coordinates associated to these transverse planes .",
    "the only difference is then that the complex coordinates @xmath232 and functions @xmath233 specifying the positions of the vortices and of the logarithmic branch cuts of @xmath218 , become functions of time as well ( with the functions @xmath233 amenable to being gauged away as before ) .",
    "this is thus how the topological structure and time dependency of a given vortex and domain wall configuration may be encoded into the function @xmath165 , from which the solutions for @xmath218 and @xmath166 may be obtained in the vortex gauge @xmath234 in the manner described previously .",
    "note that in this general case , the function @xmath165 no longer obeys the equation @xmath228 .",
    "this concludes the general discussion of the topological classification of all solutions to the coupled maxwell and lgh equations .",
    "the sector of gauge dependent variables , namely @xmath133 and @xmath145 , is determined in terms of a function @xmath165 , possibly defined up to some gauge transformation , which encodes the gauge invariant topological structure characterized through all the winding numbers which are associated to a given configuration of vortices and domain walls .",
    "the sector of gauge invariant variables , namely @xmath22up to an overall sign , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , is determined by solving the coupled lgh and maxwell equations ( [ eq : lg ] ) and ( [ eq : j ] ) , subjected to specific boundary conditions which include the  global boundary conditions \" obtained from the electromagnetic flux values @xmath172$]for all possible closed contours @xmath169 in spacetime , which in fact provide the global integrated london equations and depend on the vortex configuration through its winding numbers .",
    "this last set of equations and boundary conditions is totally gauge invariant , which is an advantage when solving this system .",
    "furthermore , one should keep in mind that the function @xmath22 is in fact defined on a double sheeted covering of the plane , with branch points at vortices and branch cuts along the surfaces of vanishing order parameter lying within the domain walls .",
    "finally , the ( free ) energy of such configurations may be obtained from the general expression ( [ eq : freeen ] ) .    in this latter respect , it is interesting to consider a few sample situations corresponding to a single straight vortex of winding number @xmath3 placed at the center of the infinite plane , for which we have seen that the winding phase factor is given by @xmath4 . in the case of an isolated integer vortex ,",
    "the physical configuration is in fact invariant under rotations around the vortex , since indeed only the order parameter @xmath235 is not cylindrically symmetric because of its winding phase factor , while no domain wall is attached to the vortex which would otherwise break this rotational invariance .",
    "consequently , at a fixed distance @xmath24 from the vortex , the order parameter retains a fixed vacuum expectation value @xmath236 , so that when taking the order parameter around the contour of radius @xmath24 from @xmath237 to @xmath238 , the values reached by @xmath63 in the complex plane all lie on the circle of radius @xmath236 which is then wound @xmath3 times starting from @xmath239 and ending back at the same point on that circle .",
    "this circle also lies somewhere in between the absolute minimum @xmath240 and the local maximum @xmath121 of the surface in the shape of the bottom of a wine bottle which is defined by the higgs potential @xmath241 .",
    "consider now again an integer vortex , say with @xmath42 , but this time bound to an even number of domain walls .",
    "rotational invariance being then broken , when going around the contour of radius @xmath24 the order parameter @xmath242 no longer retains a constant norm .",
    "rather , starting from one of the domains walls where @xmath121 , @xmath243 , the order parameter moves in a continuous fashion from the top of the higgs potential down to some maximal value for the norm @xmath244 and back to the local maximum at @xmath121 by following a closed path which passes through the latter point as often as there are domain walls bound to the vortex . more specifically ,",
    "when there are two domain walls , a single such loop is followed from top to bottom and back twice in the same direction .",
    "but when there are four domain walls for instance , then the entire closed circuit lying on the surface of the higgs potential has the shape of a four - leaved clover whose center is at the top of the higgs potential , and so on for still larger even numbers of domain walls .    similarly in the case of @xmath28 and a single domain wall ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath242 follows only once a closed loop running from the top to some lowest point on the higgs potential surface and back .",
    "when there are three domain walls bound to the @xmath28 vortex , a three - leaved clover shape is obtained , and so on . taking a @xmath30 vortex to which three domain walls are bound ,",
    "again a single loop running from top to bottom and back is followed three times , while when only one domain wall is bound to the @xmath30 vortex the closed circuit is followed only once and reaches the top of the higgs potential only once , but it then also explores surroundings lying on opposite sides of the top of the higgs potential by following a spiraling path which leaves and returns at the top in a direction perpendicular to that of its lowest point .",
    "in fact , for symmetry and energy reasons , one would expect that for half - integer vortices of winding number @xmath204 the configuration of lowest energy would either be that with all @xmath245 bound domain walls stacked on top of one another , or else spread out in a maximally symmetric star - like shape with an angular opening of @xmath246 between each . for a given vortex of integer winding number @xmath204",
    ", there also exists the third possibility that no domain wall whatsoever is bound to the vortex .",
    "presumably , which of these different possibilities is actually realized in each of these cases would also depend on the value of the scalar self - coupling @xmath247 or @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , it is for either one of these numbers of domain walls that the order parameter , when taken around a closed contour surrounding the vortex , would explore the more regions closer to the bottom of the higgs potential , thus leading to a smaller condensation energy contribution .",
    "only a detailed numerical analysis however , would resolve this issue .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we shall restrict the discussion to time independent configurations in the plane , in the manner already described previously . furthermore , since when considering bounded domains in the plane these will have the topology of either a disk or an annulus , the appropriate choice of coordinates is the polar one with the @xmath24 and @xmath198 variables also introduced previously .",
    "in particular , a disk topology will have a radius @xmath248 , namely @xmath249 given our choice of normalized units , while an annular topology will have inner and outer ( normalized ) radii @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively .",
    "an arbitrary time independent configuration in the plane is represented in terms of the following set of quantities .",
    "the electric field @xmath94 , scalar gauge potential @xmath163 and charge distribution @xmath143 all vanish .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath95 is perpendicular to the plane with a single component @xmath252 , such that @xmath253 . finally , the vectors @xmath254 and @xmath255 only have radial and azimuthal components , namely @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "all these non vanishing quantities are functions of @xmath24 and @xmath5 only , but neither of the coordinate transverse to the plane nor of time , as are then also the order parameter @xmath258 and its polar decomposition variables @xmath226 and @xmath259 . in particular , note that this restriction on the decomposition of the vector potential @xmath164 is consistent with the vortex gauge fixing condition ( [ eq : gaugefixing ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", it also proves useful to introduce the following notation , @xmath260 since these quantities appear naturally in all expressions .",
    "given such specific symmetry restrictions  namely translation invariance in time and in the direction transverse to the plane , or in other words parallel to the straight vortices and domain walls , it is immediate to determine the form of the ensuing system of equations . for the lgh equation ( [ eq : lg ] ) , one finds @xmath261f= \\left[\\left(uj\\right)^2+g^2\\right]f- \\kappa^2u^2\\left(1-f^2\\right)f , \\label{eq : lg1}\\ ] ] while the inhomogeneous maxwell equations ( [ eq : j ] ) reduce to ( in first - order form ) @xmath262 where the magnetic field ( transverse component ) is given by the local london equation @xmath263 the current conservation equation , which follows from ( [ eq : max2 ] ) of course , reads , @xmath264    the set of coupled differential equations ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) is subjected to a series of boundary conditions .",

    "the local boundary conditions at infinity which complete those in ( [ eq : bcglobal ] ) and which are required for finite energy configurations are such that @xmath226 approaches either one of the two values @xmath271 , while the quantities @xmath272 and @xmath273 must both vanish , since they directly define the components of the electromagnetic current density @xmath147 in the plane .    in the case of a bounded domain in the plane",
    ", there may exist an applied external magnetic field @xmath118 solely transverse to the plane with a component @xmath274 .",
    "based on maxwell s equations in vacuum outside the bounded domain , in the specific instance of such a geometry for @xmath275 it then follows that the magnetic field @xmath275 must indeed retain a constant homogeneous value throughout space in that region .",
    "consequently , given the remaining boundary conditions relevant to @xmath158 and @xmath148 discussed previously , it then follows that in the case of the disk topology the required local boundary conditions which complete those in ( [ eq : bcglobal ] ) are @xmath276    in the case of the annular topology , the same boundary conditions apply of course at the outer boundary at @xmath277 . similarly at the inner boundary @xmath278",
    ", one must have @xmath279 where @xmath280 represents the value of the constant magnetic field ( transverse component ) within the hole of the annulus .",

    "finally let us consider the expression for the free energy of the system .",
    "due to the invariance of the considered configurations under translations transverse to the plane , the three dimensional integral in ( [ eq : freeen ] ) is in fact infinite .",
    "we should thus rather consider the expression for the free energy per unit of length in the transverse direction , while we may also absorb the overall normalization factor in ( [ eq : freeen ] ) in that choice , thus leading in those units to the expression @xmath287 ^ 2 + \\left(\\partial_uf\\right)^2+\\frac{1}{u^2}\\left(\\partial_\\phi f\\right)^2 + f^2\\left(j^2+\\frac{1}{u^2}g^2\\right)+ \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa^2\\left(1-f^2\\right)^2\\right\\}. \\label{eq : free2}\\ ] ] note that the constant term @xmath288 has not been added to the integrand of this expression , keeping in mind the possible infinite planar topology in some applications ( for the finite disk and annular topologies , this term will be included later on ) .",

    "when evaluated for a specific solution to the differential equations ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) , the expression for the free energy as given in ( [ eq : free2 ] ) also reduces to @xmath295 ^ 2-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa^2f^4+\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa^2 \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    the above set of equations and boundary conditions thus defines the problem to be solved .",
    "the only information missing is that which provides the topological structure of the vortex and domain wall configuration which is being considered .",
    "this structure is characterized by the set of winding numbers @xmath175 $ ] which appear in the global boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcglobal ] ) .",
    "the gauge dependent details of that topological structure are specified through the choice of function @xmath296 , which in the vortex gauge ( [ eq : gaugefixing ] ) may be expressed as in ( [ eq : theta0 ] ) as explained previously , and in terms of which the quantities @xmath265 and @xmath297 are then obtained .",

    "consider the case of the infinite plane or the disk with a vortex of winding number @xmath298 placed exactly at its center @xmath266 , and a circular contour of radius @xmath267 surrouding that vortex . in the limit that the contour shrinks to the origin , since the magnetic flux @xmath299 $ ] must vanish",
    " the magnetic field being finite at @xmath266 , the azimuthal component of the current density @xmath147 at that point must be such that @xmath300 which necessarily requires @xmath301 on the one hand , since @xmath302 , this result shows that the current @xmath144 is necessarily ill - defined at the location of vortices .",
    "but on the other hand , since the order parameter @xmath63 and the function @xmath22 vanish at the location of the vortex , while the azimuthal component of the electromagnetic current @xmath303 must vanish at the same point ( this is a consequence of the polar coordinate parametrization which is being used ) , this result also shows that the singularity in @xmath304 is just mild enough to be screened by the zero in @xmath63 in such a way that the physical current @xmath303 remains well - defined and finite throughout space as it should , even at the location of vortices .",
    "the resolution of the lgh equations , even in the plane , requires a numerical analysis , since no analytic solutions are known . nevertheless , it is possible to establish some general properties for the possible solutions in some particular situations .",

    "let us consider the free energy expressed in ( [ eq : free2 ] ) in the case that no external magnetic field is applied , @xmath305 , and for the disk and infinite planar topologies . through integration by parts and the identification of the geometric meaning of the induced surface terms ,",

    "furthermore , when attempting to minimize the value of the energy by setting to zero the positive integrated quantities , thus leading to the following first - order differential equations , @xmath310 it is immediate to verify that these equations then also imply the second - order equations in ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) , but only if the coupling takes the specific value @xmath311 with @xmath81 . in other words , when the scalar self - coupling takes the critical value @xmath311 , the system of first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) integrates the second - order lgh equations of motion ( the issue of boundary conditions will be addressed shortly ) .",
    "note also that it is for the same critical coupling @xmath312 that the very last term in ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) does not contribute to the energy of such configurations .    in order to fix the choice of sign for @xmath307 ,",
    "let us note that the lowest possible value taken by @xmath313 as defined in ( [ eq : free2 ] ) is zero , corresponding to the trivial solution @xmath314 ( here @xmath305 ) , @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 in the absence of any vortex in the plane .",
    "consequenly , all other solutions must necessarily possess a strictly positive energy value , which dictates the following choice of sign @xmath318 hence , given this choice for @xmath319 and the specific value @xmath311 , the energy of any solution to the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder])which then also obey the second - order ones  is given by @xmath320 however , it is only in the case of the infinite plane that the surface term on the boundary @xmath309 does not contribute , since the boundary conditions are then such that both @xmath321 and @xmath144 vanish at infinity . furthermore , it is clear that these boundary conditions are also consistent with the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) .",
    "hence finally , one concludes that all solutions to the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) , which also obey the second - order lgh equations and the appropriate boundary conditions in the infinite plane when @xmath311 , saturate the bps value which determines their energy or mass in terms of a topological invariant , namely the total winding number of that configuration , @xmath322 conversely , it has been shown@xcite that under both the assumptions of an everywhere positive function @xmath22 and possessing only a discrete set of zeroes of integer positive degree , all the solutions to the second - order lgh equations and boundary conditions in the infinite plane with @xmath311 also solve the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) with @xmath323 . in other words , for the critical scalar self - coupling @xmath311 , any solution to the lgh equations in the infinite plane with isolated integer vortices only and of fixed total winding number @xmath3 saturates the bps value above , thus also showing@xcite that such vortices do not possess an interaction energy which would depend on their relative positions .    however , when relaxing these restrictions on the function @xmath22 , and thereby accounting for the possibility of half - integer vortices and bound domain walls in the infinite plane , one must conclude that such configurations can not solve the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) and thus can not saturate the bps value ( [ eq : bps ] ) .",
    "indeed , the first of these first - order equations would imply that on the surface of vanishing order parameter , @xmath243 , within any domain wall , the magnetic field @xmath248 would retain a constant value of @xmath324 irrespective of the distance between the vortices which are bound onto the edges of that domain wall and irrespective of the winding numbers of these vortices .",
    "such a property seems very unlickely , not only because of this lack of dependency of the magnetic field on the separation between the vortices at the edges of domain walls and on their winding numbers , but also because the magnetic energy density contribution to @xmath313 would then grow linearly with that distance , a fact which would clearly be inconsistent with the saturation of the bps value . on the other hand , we also know that the further a domain wall is streched ( provided the vortices bound onto its two edges no longer overlap ) , the more the condensation energy stored into the domain wall contributes to @xmath313 in an almost linear fashion as well , again a property which would be incompatible with the saturation of the bps value ( [ eq : bps ] ) .",
    "hence , based on such physics arguments , it must be concluded that even for the critical value @xmath311 , only isolated integer vortex solutions to the lgh equations in the infinite plane both solve the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) and saturate the bps value , while any other vortex configuration including thus domain walls can not share these properties .",
    "nonetheless , such configurations with domain walls bound to vortices in the infinite plane do obey the following bps strict lower bound @xmath325 indeed considering again ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) , the surface term at infinity vanishes in the infinite plane while the first two - dimensional volume integral is strictly positive since such configurations can not obey the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) ( the last term vanishes for @xmath311 ) .    let us now turn to the disk of finite radius @xmath291 . in this case , one is led to the conclusion that the bps lower bound @xmath326 does not apply for solutions to the second - order lgh equations with @xmath311 , even for isolated integer vortices . the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) are in fact incompatible with the required boundary conditions ( [ eq : bclocal])@xcite . indeed , even when @xmath305 , these equations and boundary conditions together imply that @xmath327 clearly if @xmath328 , such conditions can be met only if the boundary of the disk is at infinity , @xmath329 , thereby recovering the previous discussion in the infinite plane .",
    "this conclusion on its own however , would still not exclude the relevance of the bps lower bound to solutions in the disk .",
    "in fact , even had the first - order equations been consistent with the boundary conditions , there can not exist a bps lower bound on the energy of any solution in a finite disk , including the case of isolated integer vortices .",
    "indeed , the surface contribution @xmath330 does not vanish in such a situation , and could _ a priori _ carry whatever sign depending on the details of the distribution of vortices within the disk .",
    "the situation with respect to possible bps lower bounds having been understood in the case of the critical coupling @xmath311 , let us now consider again the general expression ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) relevant whatever the value for @xmath247 .",
    "clearly , for couplings larger than the critical one , @xmath331 , and configurations in the infinite plane thus leading to a vanishing surface term at infinity , the energy always obeys the bps strict lower bound in ( [ eq : bpsstrict ] ) whatever the solution to the lgh equations . indeed , on the one hand",
    ", the very last contribution in ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) proportional to @xmath332 is then always strictly positive while , on the other hand , the remaining integrated positive terms can not vanish either since otherwise this would require the first - order equations ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) ( with @xmath323 ) to be obeyed by solutions to the lgh equations , which is excluded when @xmath333 . in the case of the finite disk with @xmath331 , again no bps lower bound may be given because of the non vanishing contribution of either sign from the surface term on the disk boundary .",
    "values for the energy @xmath313 for configurations in the disk with @xmath331 could _ a priori _ be smaller as well as larger than the bps value @xmath334 depending on the distribution of vortices .",
    "finally , when @xmath335 , the same conclusion as to the absence of a bps bound must be drawn , whether for vortex configurations in the infinite plane or the disk , since in that case , the contribution of the very last term in ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) is always strictly negative .",
    "there exists however , a specific situation , albeit a singular one , for which all solutions to the lgh equations , including domains walls , do in fact saturate the bps lower bound ( [ eq : bps ] ) .",
    "as the above discussion has shown , one crucial property for saturating the bps bound is that the last integral in ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) vanishes identically@xcite .",
    "this may happen in either one of two ways , namely if @xmath311 as already discussed , or else if @xmath336 throughout the plane except possibly on a subset of zero measure .",
    "furthermore , if the latter situation is realized , then the energy becomes independent of @xmath247 , including even an infinite value for that coupling .    in the context of superconductivity , having chosen to normalize distance measurements to the penetration length @xmath36 , the limit @xmath337 corresponds to a situation such that , compared to @xmath36 , the coherence length @xmath25 becomes infinitely small .",
    "likewise , had we chosen to normalize length scales to @xmath25 , the same limit would correspond to a situation such that , compared to @xmath25 , the magnetic field penetration length becomes infinite .",
    "hence , given that the external field @xmath274 is assumed to vanish in our present considerations , one should expect that in the limit @xmath337 the magnetic field @xmath252 must vanish within the superconductor except possibly at a few discrete points .",
    "as we shall see , this is indeed what happens .    in a particle physics context however , an infinite value for @xmath247 would likewise imply either a vanishing gauge boson mass @xmath37 or else an infinite higgs mass @xmath26 . in the first instance",
    ", the vacuum expectation value @xmath338 would have to vanish while sending @xmath39 to infinity in order to keep @xmath26 non vanishing and finite , while in the second instance the parameter @xmath338 is kept non vanishing and finite while @xmath39 is also sent to infinity .",
    "thus in either case , this limit corresponds to an infinitely strongly interacting higgs sector , a regime which is incompatible with perturbative unitarity in the quantized field theory . nevertheless , in the exploration of classical solutions to the equations of motion of the abelian u(1 )",
    "higgs model , the limit @xmath337 may still provide some useful insight .    with this motivation in mind ,",
    "let us consider then the second - order lgh equations in ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) subjected to the relevant local and global boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , since only the lgh equation ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) involves the parameter @xmath247 , the limit @xmath337 may be taken in a consistent manner by first dividing that equation by @xmath339 .",
    "consequently , the only allowed solutions must be such that either @xmath243 or @xmath271 at every point of the plane , precisely allowing for all types of vortex and domain wall configurations defined over a double covering of the plane or a finite domain of it .",
    "considering then the remaining equations for @xmath252 as well as the global boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcglobal ] ) , it then follows that given a vortex distribution of winding numbers @xmath340 and positions @xmath341 ( @xmath342 ) in the plane or a finite domain of it , the solution to the lgh equations in the limit @xmath337 is given by @xmath343 where the function @xmath344 thus takes the value @xmath243 at the position of vortices and domain walls , and otherwise either one of the values @xmath271 according to the double sheeted covering of the plane which is associated to that bound vortex and domain wall configuration .",
    "obviously , such solutions are singular precisely at the positions of vortices and domain walls , with the magnetic field vanishing everywhere except at the vortices where it diverges , and the function @xmath22 constant everywhere  on the double sheeted covering of the plane  except at its branch points and on its branch cuts where it vanishes discontinuously  thus displaying the singularities of the double sheeted covering of the plane .",
    "furthermore , the current @xmath144 and thus also the electromagnetic current @xmath147 , vanishes everywhere , except again at the vortices where it is singular .",
    "the physical picture however , is clear . in the limit @xmath337 , the coherence length @xmath25 being zero or the penetration length @xmath36 being infinite ,",
    "the thickness of domain walls has shrunck to nothing while likewise vortices have been squeezed into single curves without any transverse extension but nevertheless each carrying the required finite value of magnetic flux , by having  sucked in \" all the currents responsible for that magnetic flux . in other words , in the limit @xmath337 , the system of vortices and bound domain walls has reduced to a collection , on the one hand , of membranes of zero thickness which carry no magnetic flux , are bound at their edges to aharonov - bohm flux lines of integer or half - integer flux or extend to the boundary in the case of a finite domain in the plane , and which , on the other hand , may possibly also appear in combination with some isolated aharonov - bohm flux lines of integer flux .",
    "hence once again , such configurations are very much reminiscent of d - branes@xcite and strings in m - theory , which are precisely such objects without any transverse extension .",
    "let us now consider the expression ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) for the energy of these configurations .",
    "since the magnetic field @xmath248 , the current @xmath144 and the higgs potential @xmath345 all vanish identically except on a subset of the plane of zero measure , all such configurations of aharonov - bohm flux lines and membranes of fixed total winding number @xmath205 indeed saturate the bps lower bound , @xmath346 , thus showing that all such solutions are indeed bps states , albeit singular ones . in particular , this result also implies that such aharonov - bohm flux lines and membranes have no interactions with one another , whatever their relative positions . from the physics point of view again , this fact is rather obvious .",
    "the order parameter @xmath63 reaches its constant vacuum expectation value @xmath240 and the magnetic field vanishes everywhere in space except at the positions of flux lines and membranes ( the latter applies to @xmath113 only ) , so that indeed both the magnetic and condensation energy densities vanish identically irrespective of the distribution of flux lines and membranes in space .",
    "note that these conclusions as to the bps character of the solutions to the lgh equations in the limit @xmath337 remain valid whether in the infinite plane or a disk of finite radius @xmath291 .",
    "the only restriction in the case of the infinite plane is that the total winding number @xmath205 must then be an integer , without any membrane extending up to infinity .",
    "having argued that the basic entities from which to build general solutions to the lgh equations are @xmath27-vortices , @xmath27-domain walls and annular current flows , in this section we consider the situation of a single vortex at the center of either a disk or an annulus of finite radius . even though no exact analytical solutions exist , we shall try nevertheless to gain some insight into the nature of such solutions by using some approximations , and then turn to the results of a modest first attempt at a numerical analysis of half - integer vortices .",
    "when solutions with half - integer winding number are being considered , note that we shall only consider here the case of a single domain wall bound on such a vortex , and further assume that this domain wall lies along one of the radii of the disk or annulus . indeed , even though such configurations necessarily break the axial symmetry of the disk or annulus , this breaking is kept to a minimum under such a restriction , which then remains covariant under rotations around the center of the disk or annulus which map such solutions into one another without changing their energy .",
    "this restriction is also in keeping with the fact that the natural tension which domain walls possess is such that in their lowest energy configuration domain walls must be straight not only in the direction transverse to the plane , but also within that plane .      in order to argue for the possibility of annular vortices of integer as well as half - integer winding number",
    ", we shall use the same approach as that of ref.@xcite which uncovered the existence of such configurations in the isolated integer case by considering the emergence of these solutions from the trivial solution at the normal - superconducting phase transition .",
    "namely , we shall restrict to the disk topology with a single vortex of winding number @xmath3 at its center , in the absence of any external magnetic field .",
    "clearly , the solution to the lgh equations which describes the system at the phase transition is then given by @xmath347 so that the order parameter vanishes identically , @xmath348 , with a vanishing energy for the state , @xmath349 ( for the remainder of the paper , the subtraction constant @xmath288 is being included in the definition of the free energy ( [ eq : free2 ] ) ) , and a non vanishing winding number nonetheless .",
    "this solution may also be obtained by considering a rescaling by a real parameter @xmath350 of the order parameter , such that @xmath351 and then taking the limit @xmath352 in the lgh equations and relevant boundary conditions .",
    "doing so , one finds that the function @xmath353 satisfies the linearized lgh equation , @xmath354\\tilde{f}= \\left[(uj)^2+g^2\\right]\\tilde{f}-\\kappa^2u^2\\tilde{f}.\\ ] ] given the solution in ( [ eq : normal ] ) , as well as the requirement that @xmath353 should vanish at the origin when @xmath6 since this is the position of the vortex where @xmath226 must vanish , the linearized lgh equation possesses a single solution .",
    "the case of an isolated vortex of integer winding number has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us restrict here to that of a half - integer value for the winding number @xmath3 of a single vortex which is bound onto a single domain wall lying along a radius of the disk ( the generalization to more domain walls and integer winding numbers is immediate , as the reader will realize ) .    under these specific assumptions , and the fact that the equation for @xmath353 in the limit @xmath352 is linear , it is natural to consider the following separation of variables , @xmath355 which clearly displays",
    "a cut at @xmath213 , having assumed the domain wall to be at @xmath356 where the branch cut for @xmath353 in the double covering of the disk thus lies .",
    "the solution for @xmath357 is then simply a bessel function of the first kind with index @xmath358 , @xmath359 where the normalization is chosen such that the lowest order term in a series expansion in @xmath24 is @xmath360 .",
    "as is well known , such a bessel function has an almost periodic oscillatory behaviour with an amplitude which asymptotically decreases as @xmath361 at large radii .",
    "consequently , as soon as the parameter @xmath350 is turned on slightly away from zero , this oscillatory pattern hidden in the solution @xmath362 will emerge from the vanishing condensate , and lead to a pattern of concentric annular current flows of approximately constant width @xmath363 ( in units of @xmath36 ) surrounding the half - integer vortex of winding number @xmath3 which is bound onto the edge of a single domain wall ( only the index @xmath364 of the bessel function as well as the periodicity of the trigonometric function in @xmath5 change when more domain walls are involved ) .",
    "of course , the boundary conditions at @xmath277 are then no longer satisfied , so that both the parameter @xmath350 as well as the remaining functions @xmath289 and @xmath290 must then be adjusted in order to obtain a solution of negative energy to the lgh equations , thereby also pushing outwards the pattern of concentric annular current flows without essentially changing their width@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of the bessel function solution to the linearized lgh equation at the phase transition provides a very strong argument for the existence in finite domains of annular vortex solutions of arbitrary half - integer winding number bound onto the edges of an arbitrary number of domain walls .",
    "the existence of such solutions without domain walls has indeed been established along such lines for integer vortices in ref.@xcite .",
    "there is no reason to doubt that the same conclusion should not also hold for integer and half - integer vortices bound onto domain walls .    even though it is impossible to obtain an exact solution to the equations when turning on the parameter @xmath350 , even in the form of a power series expansion , it is interesting to consider the first - order corrections that this implies for the quantities @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath248 , without including the corrections implied for @xmath226 itself .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath24 , and still assuming only a single domain wall , one finds , when also imposing the current conservation equation , @xmath365 where @xmath366 stands for the value of the magnetic field at the vortex @xmath266 and @xmath267 for an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "these expressions are at least indicative of the singularities in @xmath272 and @xmath273 not only at the position of the vortex  a fact which was already demonstrated previously  but also on the surface of vanishing order parameter at @xmath356 , namely on the branch cut in the function @xmath226 , but in such a way that the physical electromagnetic current @xmath147 remains well defined and regular on this branch cut nonetheless , including the quantum tunnel effect through the domain wall in the proximity of the vortex as was described in the introduction .",
    "these properties , announced previously , are thus made explicit in this approximate representation of a single vortex in the disk bound onto a single domain wall .",
    "another instance for which it is possible to gain insight into the nature of half - integer vortex solutions in a particular limit , is that when the width of the annular topology vanishes , the outer radius being kept fixed , namely the limit @xmath367 .",
    "let us assume that a single winding number @xmath3 is trapped in the center of the annulus of width @xmath368 and outer radius @xmath291 .",
    "consequently , the value @xmath280 of the magnetic field inside the hole must be such that @xmath369    in the limit that the annulus becomes infinitely thin , @xmath367 , the magnetic field both within the superconductor as well as inside the hole takes the value @xmath274 of the applied field .",
    "moreover in that limit we shall also take the approximation that @xmath316 , the annulus having no radial extent anymore , even though such a restriction may prove to be inconsistent with the current conservation condition . in this limit ,",
    "not only does the above global boundary condition imply a specific restriction on the function @xmath370 in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath274 , but also the free energy ( [ eq : free2 ] ) then reduces to the expression , @xmath371    in order to address the problem of minimizing the free energy and thus solve the lgh equations in the thin annulus limit , let first consider the case of an integer winding number @xmath3 without any domain wall lying along some radius within the annulus . because of the axial symmetry of such a configuration , no @xmath5-dependency arises for the functions @xmath248 , @xmath290 and @xmath22 , and one is left only with the following relations ( with all these quantities evaluated at @xmath277 , of course ) @xmath372.\\ ] ] it is immediate to show that the free energy is minimized for the following values @xmath373 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in turns out that this quartic dependency of @xmath313 on the applied field @xmath274 provides a rather good approximation to exact numerical solutions for annuli of finite width @xmath374 small compared to @xmath291 , since it presents a turn over point precisely at the values of @xmath274 where this expression vanishes .",
    "this property is very close to the behaviour of the exact solutions , while it is not reproduced by the quadratic dependency which is usually discussed in textbooks@xcite .",
    "whatever the relevance of this latter remark , the important point is that when considered for all possible integer values @xmath3 , the graphs for the free energy @xmath313 as a function of @xmath274 all cross one another in succession before their turn over points at @xmath349 provided that @xmath375 and for values such that @xmath376,\\ ] ] @xmath220 being an arbitrary positive , negative or zero integer .",
    "this , of course , is the experimentally observed behaviour as well , namely the little - parks effect@xcite , the crossing points occurring for a magnetic flux through the annulus equal to a half - integer multiple of the quantum of flux @xmath69 ( note also the lower bound on the annulus radius , @xmath377 ) .",
    "furthermore , the absolute minimimum of the free energy is reached for @xmath378 while the absolute maxima are reached for @xmath379    let us now consider a similar analysis in the case of a half - integer winding number @xmath3 , which should thus also include some domain wall structure inside the thin annulus . the axial symmetry of the equations then being broken , all quantities @xmath380 , @xmath381 and @xmath382 become @xmath5-dependent .",
    "hence , the minimization of the free energy leads in this case to the differential equation , @xmath383 while the function @xmath381 is constrained by the condition @xmath384 finally , let us also include the current conservation equation , which in the present limit reduces to @xmath385 hence , we must have @xmath386 with @xmath169 some integration constant .    first in the case that this constant vanishes , @xmath387 , we necessarily have @xmath388 , which thus implies that such a situation is obtained only for values of the applied field such that @xmath389 @xmath220 being an arbitrary integer .",
    "these are precisely the values for which the energy of the thin annulus is degenerate for two consecutive integer winding numbers ( provided @xmath375 ) . furthermore , the solution for the order parameter is then @xmath390 leading to a value for the free energy of this configuration given by @xmath391\\right\\}.\\ ] ] this value always lies above that @xmath392 for the integer winding number case at the same magnetic field values , whatever the value for @xmath375 .",
    "the solution found for @xmath382 does indeed display a cut at @xmath213 , in accordance with the half - integer winding number , and vanishes at @xmath356 , indicating the presence of a single domain wall in the thin annulus .",
    "however , the condensate @xmath393 presents a discontinuity in its angular derivative at the cut at @xmath213 , since we have @xmath394.\\ ] ] such a discontinuity is not physically acceptable , and is a consequence of the thin annulus limit which we have taken .",
    "nevertheless , this approximate solution to the full lgh equations provides some interesting insight into the properties of half - integer vortex solutions .",
    "let us now turn to the situation when the integration constant @xmath169 does not vanish .",
    "in fact , the differential equation to be solved , ( [ eq : thinannulus ] ) , is also that of a non relativistic particle of unit mass moving on the real line @xmath395 and subjected to the potential @xmath396 whose conserved energy @xmath397 is thus @xmath398 hence , there can not exist a solution for @xmath382 passing through the value @xmath243 for any finite value of the integration constant @xmath397 , since the potential @xmath399 diverges at that point .",
    "an infinite value for @xmath397 would rather be required , but this in turn is physically unacceptable since in such a case the angular variation @xmath400 of the order parameter would be infinite at all points except possibly at those where @xmath243 , thus also leading to an infinite energy .",
    "hence we must conclude that no solution to the above equations may be found when @xmath401 .",
    "the physical interpretation of these results is as follows .",
    "having taken the thin annulus limit @xmath367 with the restriction that @xmath402 , this is consistent with the current conservation equation only for integer winding numbers without domain walls , since the axial symmetry of such solutions even for an annulus of finite width is such that @xmath316 in any case . for half - integer winding numbers or integer vortices bound to domain walls however , this limit is such that all states are squeezed out from the annulus , by acquiring an infinite energy .",
    "it is only when the applied field @xmath274 takes the distinguished values at which two consecutive integer winding states without domain walls become degenerate ( which requires @xmath375 ) , that the states of half - integer winding number and with a single domain wall across the annulus retain a finite energy , but yet develop a discontinuity in the angular variation of the order parameter .",
    "let us now finally turn to some exact solutions to the lgh equations ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) in the disk , albeit numerical ones . the numerical resolution of these differential equations presents some genuine challenges . even in the case of axially symmetric configurations , namely a single isolated giant vortex of integer winding number at the center of the disk , and thus in the absence of any domain wall ,",
    "the direct numerical integration of the then ordinary differential equations for @xmath403 , @xmath404 and @xmath405@xmath406 in that case  are quite delicate .",
    "these equations then read @xmath407f(u)=g^2(u)f(u)-\\kappa^2u^2 \\left(1-f^2(u)\\right)f(u),\\ ] ] with of course @xmath408 and the boundary conditions @xmath409 @xmath3 being the integer winding number .",
    "the main reason for difficulties in this case is , on the one hand , that the equations are non linear  the cubic term in @xmath410 in the lgh equation makes the stability of any numerical integration problematic , and on the other hand , that the above local boundary conditions are in fact delocalized at the two boundaries of the disk , namely at @xmath266 and at @xmath277 .",
    "hence , whether integrating inwards or outwards , half of the initial values must be adjusted in order to satisfy the required boundary conditions at the other boundary . nevertheless , it is still possible to manage such difficulties , and even obtain the annular vortex solutions although the precision requirements on the initial values then become critical@xcite .    in the case of configurations which are no longer axially symmetric , namely those involving either isolated integer vortices which are",
    "no longer at the center of the disk , or domain walls , or both , these difficulties are much greater , since the non linear equations are then partial differential ones in two variables for a larger number of quantities to be integrated , and with not only delocalized local boundary conditions but also the global boundary conditions corresponding to the integrated london equations for all contours in the plane . furthermore , as we have seen , the current @xmath254 is then also singular at the positions of vortices and inside the domain walls .",
    "these singularities at the location of a vortex which is at the center of the disk can be handled as above in the axially symmetric case , since we then have @xmath411 and @xmath412 .",
    "unfortunately , such a simplification does not apply to vortices away from the origin @xmath266 nor to domain walls .",
    "the alternative to integrating numerically the partial differential equations ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) subjected to the local and global boundary conditions , is to consider rather the numerical minimization of the free energy ( [ eq : free2 ] ) of the system using a steepest descent method of one type or another .",
    "indeed , since the free energy coincides , up to a sign , with the action in the case of time independent configurations , the minimization of the energy is equivalent to solving the equations of motion .",
    "most of the difficulties mentioned above may then be circumvented , by an appropriate choice of lattice discretization and of the positioning of the vortices and domain walls off the lattice sites .",
    "such a procedure however , requires a lot of computational power , since all variables to be determined  in the present case the quantities @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath22are to be varied at each lattice site in order to follow the path of steepest descent in the free energy .",
    "this is , in a few words , the general method which has been applied in order to obtain the results to be presented here and in section [ subsect5.2 ] .",
    "further details will be provided elsewhere .    at this stage ,",
    "simulations of only modest computer time have been run , leading to results which lack great precision .",
    "the only results to be described in this section apply for the following choice of parameters @xmath413 the lattice discretization uses the polar coordinate parametrization with 10 intervals in the radial variable @xmath414 and 10 intervals in the angular range @xmath415 .",
    "indeed , the only configurations considered involve either a single integer vortex with @xmath416 without a domain wall at the center of the disk , or else a single half - integer vortex with @xmath417 also at the center of the disk and then bound onto only one domain wall . furthermore , for reasons already given previously , we assume this domain wall to be straight and to extent all the way to the boundary of the disk by lying along one of its radii , which we take to be the one at @xmath356 . consequently , all these configurations possess specific symmetry properties under @xmath418 , which may be taken advantage of to reduce by half the calculation labor .",
    "the rather coarse grained discretization used may imply a rather poor precision .",
    "since the same procedure is applied to all configurations , one may reasonably hope that whatever the numerical uncertainties , they would all contribute in the same direction so that at least the general properties , if not the precise numerical values , are to be trusted .",
    "indeed , at least in the case of the configurations with integer winding number which are axially symmetric , the angular integration becomes trivial and a far more precise resolution , either by minimizing the free energy or by integrating the ordinary differential equations of motion using a 4th order runge - kutta method , becomes possible .",
    "the comparison between the different approaches then shows that the steepest descent method used in the half - disk leads to values for the free energy which are precise to 1% to 2% but which all deviate from their actual values in the same direction as expected .",
    "hence , the same quality should apply to the results for the configurations with @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "fig.1 presents the results for the free energy of the disk in these different vortex and domain wall configurations as a function of the applied external magnetic field @xmath274 .",
    "of course , the well known behaviour of the energy for the @xmath416 configurations is reproduced .",
    "however , the curves for the solutions of winding numbers @xmath28 and @xmath30 are totally new , and are quite noteworthy .",
    "first , one may notice that at the values of @xmath274 where the curves of integer @xmath3 cross each other , the energy values for the half - integer winding numbers always lie above those for the integer winding numbers , in agreement with the result of the analysis in the thin annulus limit .",
    "second , the magnetic field dependency of the energy for half - integer winding numbers seems to be less pronounced than for the integer ones , and thus extends to larger values of @xmath274 before hitting the phase transition line at @xmath349 .",
    "nevertheless , these curves always lie above those of integer winding numbers ( including @xmath419 not represented ) , so that the lowest energy states , at least for the geometry considered , always correspond to some giant vortex state without a domain wall .",
    "third , the @xmath28 and @xmath30 curves lie much closer to one another than do the integer winding number ones . in particular",
    ", it is quite remarkable that at @xmath305 , both half - integer winding number curves lie below all the giant vortex ones without domain wall for @xmath6 with three domain walls would lie . ] .",
    "clearly , this is only one single example of such results in a very specific case , and it would be extremely interesting to see how these different features would change when varying the geometry of the disk and the value for @xmath247 , when moving the vortices around within the disk , when allowing the domain walls to end on some other vortex inside the disk , when including more domain walls , and so on . obviously , all these issues are of direct relevance to the detailed understanding of the magnetization properties and dynamics of mesoscopic superconducting disks and loops in varying electromagnetic fields .    even though not displayed , the numerical solutions for the configurations considered above also confirm the fact that there is indeed an electromagnetic current flow which quantum tunnels through the domain wall close to the vortex position for the @xmath417 winding number cases . furthermore ,",
    "within the core of these vortices , the magnetic field is of course not axially symmetric , but in fact it even presents a shape such that its values first increase when moving out from the center of the vortex before decreasing towards the disk boundary .",
    "this volcano - like shaped surface also possesses a valley - like small depression in the direction of the domain wall , along which the order parameter @xmath420 takes of course smaller values and thus lets the magnetic field penetrate further in and decrease less rapidly as well ( see ( [ eq : max2 ] ) ) .    in spite of the modesty of these first numerical results , they do establish the existence of half - integer winding number solutions to the lgh equations , bound to domain walls , and demonstrate the potential these new configurations have to contribute in crucial ways to the static and dynamic properties of any physical system which is described , even if only in an effective way , by the abelian u(1 ) higgs model , and such instances of course are not confined to superconductors only .",
    "bound @xmath27-domain walls were argued to provide the basic entities in terms of which any solution to the lgh equations in the infinite plane could be viewed as a particular combination of such states being stacked together . before considering in the next section the results of a modest attempt at a numerical resolution , here we shall present a specific bound @xmath27-domain wall solution to the lgh equations ( [ eq : lg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) in the infinite plane .    even though this solution possesses an infinite energy , it may in fact",
    "be viewed to correspond to a bound @xmath27-domain wall which is infinitely streched in a specific direction so that the two @xmath27-vortices bound onto its edges are at infinity .",
    "it is this infinite length of the domain wall which explains its infinite energy of course . in spite of this fact however , the solution is interesting in that it illustrates some of the properties of bound @xmath27-domain walls in a particularly simple limit , while also demonstrating that indeed the energy of domain walls is linear in their length when the vortices at their edges no longer overlap .    to describe this specific solution ,",
    "it is best to consider a system of cartesian coordinates @xmath421 and @xmath422 in the infinite plane ( normalized to @xmath36 ) , and to assume that the domain wall is aligned , say , with the @xmath421 axis , so that the configuration is also invariant under translations parallel to that axis .",
    "hence , all variables must be independent of @xmath421 .",
    "furthermore , given the physical interpretation , in which the @xmath27-vortices are at infinity , one should expect that both the magnetic field @xmath423 as well as the current @xmath424 , and thus also the electromagnetic current density @xmath425 , vanish everywhere in the plane , @xmath426 these restrictions are clearly consistent with the current conservation equation , while the lgh equation for the order parameter then reduces to @xmath427 this latter equation is of course well known , and possesses solitonic solutions running from one vacuum @xmath428 of the higgs potential to the other @xmath429 . in the present case , the solution we are interested in is that corresponding to a single domain wall which separates two regions of the plane in which each of these two expectations values are reached at infinity .",
    "hence , the infinitely streched bound @xmath27-domain wall is described by the one soliton or antisoliton configuration @xmath430 note how this solution takes values of opposite signs on both sides of the @xmath421 axis , the choice of @xmath431 sign in this expression corresponding to a choice of sheet in the double sheeted covering of the plane which is defined by these one soliton and antisoliton configurations .",
    "similarly , a @xmath432 soliton ( or antisoliton ) solution would correspond to @xmath216 such infinitely streched bound @xmath27-domain walls all lying parallel to one another in the infinite plane .",
    "depending on the odd or even character of @xmath216 , such states are not topologically stable and would decay either to a single bound @xmath27-domain wall if @xmath216 is odd , or else to the vacuum configuration @xmath433 if @xmath216 is even .",
    "clearly , these configurations being translationally invariant along a specific direction in the plane , possess an energy ( [ eq : free2 ] ) which is infinite .",
    "nevertheless , let us consider their energy per unit of length @xmath434 along their symmetry axis , chosen here to be the @xmath421 axis .",
    "one then finds for the one soliton configuration direction , @xmath435 , but the boundary conditions @xmath436 are then not satisfied .",
    "] @xmath437 hence in this limit of an infinite separation of the two edges of the bound @xmath27-domain wall , the energy does grow linearly with that distance .",
    "the amount of condensation energy  no magnetic energy density is present in the configuration  stored in the domain wall which is of constant thickness is proportional to its length .",
    "these are indeed the expected properties of streched bound @xmath27-domain walls , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "let us now consider the numerical resolution of the lgh equations for a bound @xmath27-domain wall in the disk topology , using the minimization of the free energy through steepest descent .",
    "only the specific instance of a vanishing external magnetic field will be considered , @xmath305 .",
    "clearly , such an analysis touches directly onto the issue of the stability of the ano vortex of winding number @xmath7 , so that we shall in fact consider for different values of @xmath247 the dependency of the energy ( [ eq : free2 ] ) of such states as a function of the separation between the two @xmath33 vortices bound onto the edges of such a domain wall .    in the introduction",
    ", it was argued that there might exist a critical value @xmath438 marking the boundary between the situation where , on the one hand , the bound @xmath27-domain wall would be stable for a specific streched length ( function of @xmath247 ) , and on the other hand , where it would always collapse into the @xmath7 ano vortex .",
    "furthermore , it was also suggested , based on the interplay between repulsive and attractive magnetic and scalar forces and the situation in this respect for isolated giant vortices , that this critical value @xmath438 could even coincide with the critical value @xmath439 which governs a similar behaviour for integer vortices without domain walls , and which also coincides with the critical value @xmath312 for which the latter states saturate the bps bound .",
    "based on such considerations , one would thus expect that the numerical resolution should possess some distinguishing feature when @xmath440 .",
    "in particular , it could then be the case that , for @xmath335 the energy of the bound @xmath27-domain wall would display a strictly positive monotonous increase as a function of its extension starting already from zero separation , while for @xmath311 this same derivative would vanish , and finally for @xmath331 , a small dip in the energy would be observed close to the origin corresponding to a split abrikosov vortex at equilibrium , before turning over into the linear increase which is to be expected in any case for a sufficiently large separation .    on the other hand , the existence of bps lower bounds in the case of an infinite plane may also be brought to bear on this issue , in fact then leading to the opposite expectations ! indeed , even when @xmath311 , we have seen that the only states which saturate the bps bound are the isolated integer giant vortex ones , whereas any of the other vortices which involve at least one domain wall have an energy which is necessarily always strictly larger .",
    "hence , in the infinite plane , the @xmath7 ano vortex must be stable when @xmath311 . for @xmath331 however , since the bps lower bound can never be saturated for whatever solution , the possibility that the energy could present a minimal value at non zero separation , before turning over into the linear increase , remains an open possibility .",
    "the same remark also applies when @xmath335 , the more so since no bps lower bound applies in this case , the term proportional to @xmath332 in ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) being then always strictly negative . in fact , from this point of view , this is the situation which would seem to offer the best case for an unstable ano vortex since this term is the more negative the more the domain wall is streched ( of course , the strictly positive two - dimensional volume integral in ( [ eq : bpsenergy ] ) always ends up winning over for sufficient separation ) .",
    "these types of arguments would thus indicate that the value @xmath311 could indeed play a distinguished role , but rather in exactly the opposite way to that which was argued for previously .    to make things even more delicate ,",
    "let us also note that for the more realistic case of a finite planar domain , such as a disk or an annulus , the bps lower bounds no longer apply because of the contribution to the energy of the surface term at the boundary , so that even for the value @xmath311 the issue becomes uncertain .",
    "furthermore , for finite domains , when the domain wall is sufficiently streched so that at least one of its edges comes close to the boundary , the bean - livingston barrier@xcite would also become involved in the energy balance of the system , leading to further structure in the dependency of the energy on the vortex separation .",
    "finally , let us also recall that in the singular limit @xmath337 , all the solutions to the lgh equations become degenerate in energy and saturate the bps bound . since there are no interactions acting between the then membranes and aharonov - bohm flux lines , the bound @xmath27-domain wall is stable for whatever separation of its two edges .",
    "this remark indicates that at least in this extreme regime , the ano vortex may indeed split into such a state .",
    "hence , one must conclude that given this lack of guidance for an educated guess , only a detailed numerical analysis of the problem can answer this all important issue of the stability of the ano vortex as a function of the coupling @xmath247 .",
    "this section presents the results of a first attempt towards a resolution , which , unfortunately , proves to be still too modest to enable any definite conclusion .",
    "in fact , a full - fledged dedicated computationally intensive numerical analysis is required to resolve this important question , which we hope to be able to address elsewhere .",
    "the specific configuration which has been analyzed is as follows .",
    "each of the @xmath28 vortices is placed at an equal distance @xmath441 ( in units of @xmath36 ) and on opposite sides from the center of the disk , while the straight domain wall joining them is aligned with the corresponding diameter , for the reasons given previously . because of the four - fold symmetry of the configuration , it suffices to solve the problem in only one quadrant of the disk , say for @xmath442 .",
    "the lattice discretization used 20 intervals in the radial direction @xmath414 and 16 intervals in the angular range @xmath442 .",
    "finally , to avoid as much as possible effects due to the finite boundary  such as the bean - livingston barrier  while still having a sufficiently fine - grained lattice discretization , the disk radius was set to @xmath443    the values for the coupling @xmath247 which were considered are @xmath444 for each of these values , the steepest descent minimization of the energy of the system was solved numerically , starting with @xmath445 , as a function of a regularly spaced series of values for the distance @xmath441 , which measures the position from the center of the disk of each of the two @xmath27-vortices bound onto the edges of the bound @xmath27-domain wall thus streched to the length @xmath446 .",
    "fig.2 presents the results of these computations for the value @xmath440 .",
    "the results for the other values of @xmath247 show exactly the same behaviour  the only difference being in the vertical scale for energy values , with in particular always a small dip in the energy at the first non zero step in the values for @xmath441 whatever the value for @xmath247 . clearly",
    ", the appearance of such a dip for all the considered values of @xmath247 does not agree with any of the expectations discussed above .",
    "it is not totally excluded that this may be due to subtle finite size effects because of the boundary at @xmath277 , since @xmath447 is yet not that small .",
    "indeed , the total magnetic flux @xmath448 $ ] was also monitored during the simulation and does also display a curious behaviour .",
    "when @xmath445 , one has a single @xmath42 ano vortex at the center of the disk , and @xmath448 $ ] then takes a value very close to unity as it should , namely @xmath448=0.989 $ ] .",
    "however , when @xmath441 then increases , the values for @xmath448 $ ] first increase getting even closer to the value of unity , before finally decreasing as they should when the two @xmath27-vortices move closer to the disk boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear whether these two results for @xmath313 and @xmath448 $ ] could not also be a numerical artifact for small values of @xmath441 , even though exactly the same computer code was applied to the situations with @xmath445 and @xmath449 .",
    "unfortunately at this stage , it is not possible to resolve that specific issue , which may only be addressed through a full - fledged analysis including a much finer - grained discretization which is necessarily very much more computationally intensive .",
    "nevertheless , note that the numerical solution does display the expected linear increase in energy with separation , as soon as the bound @xmath27-domain wall is sufficiently streched , namely when the two @xmath27-vortices no longer overlap .",
    "indeed , the linear behaviour sets in around @xmath450 for all considered values of @xmath247 ( recall that @xmath441 is measured in units of @xmath36 ) . but here again , a much finer - grained analysis as a function of the separation is required .",
    "hence , it seems fair at this stage to say that the fascinating and important issue of the possible instability of the ano vortex as a function of @xmath247 , which would then decay into a bound @xmath27-domain wall streched to some length which should also depend on the value for @xmath247 , is still completely open . even though the quality of this first numerical analysis is too poor to reach a definite conclusion as well as a detailed understanding",
    ", the evidence which is available does not exclude the possibility , quite to the contrary .",
    "the fine - grained topological analysis which considers the transport of the complex scalar field around all possible finite contours in spacetime , has thus uncovered a fascinatingly rich zoology of topological solutions to the landau - ginzburg - higgs equations of the abelian u(1 ) higgs model . beyond the well known vortex states of integer winding number",
    ", the new configurations also include vortices of integer as well as half - integer winding number bound onto the edges of domain walls , all such vortex configurations possibly also being surrounded by annular current flows in the case of bounded spatial domains .",
    "the existence and physical consistency of these new states is related in a fundamental way to the u(1 ) local gauge invariance of the model , leading specifically to the all important fact that any of these states is to be characterized in terms of some double sheeted covering of the plane .",
    "the specific details of the physical properties of these solutions , and of their mathematical construction , have been described in the introduction and established in the body of the paper .    even though the numerical analysis has not yet been able to answer some important issues , such as for instance the identification of the lowest energy configurations for specific combinations of such states , perhaps the most important of these cases being the possible instability of the usual abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortex to split into a domain wall with two vortices of winding number @xmath28 bound onto its edges , the mere existence of such solutions raises a host of fascinating potential dynamical properties .",
    "indeed , it now becomes possible to imagine that under specific electromagnetic disturbances , the magnetic vortices of systems described by these equations would not only move around in space , but could then also be deformed elastically into domain walls with vortices bound onto their edges , very much like rubber bands which would be pulled in different directions .",
    "such properties should have important consequences , for instance , with regards to the transport of electromagnetic energy in the vacuum of systems obeying these equations , even if only in an effective way .",
    "quite obviously , many issues of potential great direct physical interest , both in the static as well as in the dynamical regime , are raised by the existence of these new topological states in the abelian u(1 ) higgs model .    beyond their physical interest ,",
    "these solutions raise other questions as well . from the mathematical physics point of view",
    ", it would presumably be very satisfying if the existence of such topological configurations , as well as of their stability , could be put on a firm mathematical ground , as has been done for the usual vortex solutions@xcite .",
    "one may also consider applying ( an adapted form of ) the fine - grained topological analysis to other field theories known to possess topological states , and possibly uncover further structure in these states as has been done here , for example by lifting specific symmetry properties such as rotational invariance ( indeed , among the states described in this paper , only the usual vortices possess that symmetry ) .",
    "extensions to higher spacetime dimensions or differential forms of higher degree could also be envisaged , having in mind the close analogy with d - branes and strings in m - theory , and the bps bounds which are saturated for infinitely thin domain walls and vortices , corresponding then to sets of bound membranes and aharonov - bohm flux lines .",
    "closer to particle physics considerations , these new solutions may also play an interesting role in the landau - ginzburg model of dual colour superconductivity as an effective description for the dual meissner effect and confinement in qcd .",
    "finally , since vortices and domain walls are quite generic in grand unified theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking , the possibility that the states described here , or their cousins , could become involved in some interesting ways in texture formations@xcite in the universe should not be excluded either .",
    "nonetheless , the field for which the results of this paper offer perhaps the most immediate interest is that of superconductivity .",
    "the issue of the possible instability of the abrikosov vortex is especially intriguing .",
    "had we already been able to identify the equilibrium configuration of the streched bound @xmath27-domain wall as a function of the landau - ginzburg parameter @xmath247 , this could have been confronted to actual data , say in an abrikosov lattice or in a nanoscopic superconducting disk - domain wall would also have to be known , in order to assess the required sensitivity in field values of the magnetic imaging technique to be used .",
    "spatial resolution however , is no longer an issue@xcite ] .",
    "it may even be that the streching of the domain wall could be amplified to some degree by applying some external magnetic field .",
    "such questions are certainly fascinating and deserve detailed study .",
    "note that the recent results of ref.@xcite may be related to these issues . as remarked above , the existence of split vortices and domain walls ,",
    "even if not as stable states , should also imply specific dynamical properties of superconductors submitted to electromagnetic disturbances , especially in regimes of frequencies whose wave lengths become comparable to the penetration and coherence lengths , and to the actual size of vortices and the thickness of domain walls on which electromagnetic waves would then pull almost as if rubber bands .",
    "in fact , we were led into the analysis of the issues of this paper because of our few years old project to develop a quantum detector for polarized particles based on superconducting loops@xcite .",
    "indeed , when such a loop is polarized in an external magnetic field close enough to the switching between two successive winding number states so that some local disturbance in the magnetic field would cause the loop to switch from one state to the other and back , this non linear response of the loop by a significant fraction of a full quantum of flux may be picked up by an inductive circuit coupled to a squid .",
    "the same principle is at work in other devices using superconducting loops , albeit of larger dimensions , aimed towards the development of superconducting@xcite ( or ) quantum@xcite computers .",
    "however , in order to optimize the geometry of the loop with the particle detector application in mind , it becomes necessary to have a detailed understanding of the dynamics in a relativistic regime of the switching mechanism , which seems not be known .",
    "only energy based considerations in the static regime are available for superconducting mesoscopic disks and annuli , mostly motivated by the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the only exception may be the analysis of ref.@xcite which provides a detailed picture for how an integer vortex may move in and out a superconducting disk or loop as a function of the applied field .",
    "now that @xmath27-vortices bound onto the edge of a @xmath27-domain wall have been uncovered from the same landau - ginzburg equations , the whole issue has to reconsidered again , to see whether there are specific loop geometries for which the sensitivity of the dynamical response to disturbances could be optimized , for example by having the @xmath28 state have a lower energy than the @xmath42 one when being degenerate with the @xmath32 state , so that magnetic flux would move in and out of such devices through a string of smaller bits than when only integer vortices are involved .",
    "yet once again , the abelian u(1 ) higgs model has proved to have still unknown precious tools hidden at the bottom of its treasure chest , to provide us , as if the robinson crusoes of the universe stranded on our little  speckle of dust \" , with the means to explore ever further the physical world at so many different scales .",
