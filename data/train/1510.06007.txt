    "in the last years there has been substantial progress in increasing the photoconversion efficiency of the so - called hit ( heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer ) solar cells .",
    "for instance , the work @xcite reports the efficiency of 25.6% for am1.5 spectrum .",
    "however , according to the estimates performed in several works , such as @xcite , the highest theoretical efficiency of silicon - based photoconverters under unfocused solar radiation is about 30% . in order to approach the limit efficiency ,",
    "it is necessary to intensify the research aiming at optimizing the parameters of these structures .",
    "this requires deeper understanding of the peculiarities of the processes that take place in hit elements as compared to the standard solar cells .",
    "the principal difference between the hit elements and the p - n junction - based solar cells is that , in order to contribute to the photoinduced current , the photogenerated electrons and holes need to travel through the wide - bandgap layers of @xmath0-si : h or @xmath0-sic : h @xcite .",
    "the band diagram of a heterojunction depends both on the bandgaps of the semiconductors in contact and on the respective electron affinities .",
    "the absence of a barrier on the heterojunction boundary for at least one band is not a rule , but an exception . in the case",
    "considered , the very thin layers of wide - bandgap semiconductors behave as dielectrics . the current transport through such layers proceeds via either direct or multistep trap - assisted tunneling @xcite . as estimates show",
    ", the former mechanism can not produce the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes for dielectric thicknesses of the order of 10 nm , the typical thickness of the @xmath0-si : h or @xmath0-sic : h layers in hit elements .",
    "therefore , the photocurrent is most likely due to the trap - assisted tunneling .    in this work ,",
    "we have manufactured hit elements with the efficiency close to 20% and measured their main characteristics , such as the short - circuit current , @xmath3 , the open - circuit voltage , @xmath4 , the fill factor , @xmath5 , and the photogenerated power , @xmath6 , in a broad temperature range from 80 to 420k .    in order to explain theoretically the results obtained , we derive the conditions , under which the determination of the photoconversion efficiency @xmath7 in the hit elements can be performed using the same procedure as in the usual p - n junction - based solar cells .",
    "the model presented here takes into account the distinct features of the hit solar cells as compared to the conventional solar cells . in the first place",
    ", these features are related to the high bulk shokley - hall - reed lifetime @xmath8 ( @xmath9ms ) . due to this , the inequalities @xmath10 and @xmath11 hold in a broad temperature range , where @xmath12 is the excess electron - hole density in the base region ( si single crystal ) , @xmath13 the doping level , @xmath14 the diffusion length of the minority carriers in the base , and @xmath15 the base thickness .",
    "we show that for @xmath10 , the open - circuit voltage @xmath4 is higher than in the standard case @xmath16 not only because of the higher @xmath12-value , but also because of the additional contribution due to the back surface of the solar cell .",
    "we take into account several recombination mechanisms .",
    "we establish that in hit solar cells at @xmath17k , shockley - hall - reed and surface recombination dominate at relatively low base doping level , and interband auger recombination at high base doping level .",
    "we explain the notable insensitivity of the hit elements photoconversion efficiency to temperature as compared to the commercial solar cells @xcite , first and foremost , by the essential reduction of the total bulk and surface recombination rates in the hit elements .    in order to explain the experimental temperature dependence of the fill factor and photoconversion power , we take into account the increase of the series resistance in the low - temperature range , which is due to the increase of the contact resistance .    finally , by means of solving the equations for photogenerated current and voltage coupled to the temperature balance equation",
    ", we find the temperature of hit element under working conditions .",
    "we show that an element operating under the am0 radiation conditions in the environment with the temperature of about 173k ( -100@xmath18c ) has the temperature exceeding 300k .",
    "the reason is insufficient radiative cooling , which , in turn , is related to the fact that about 80% of the solar energy incident on the hit elements is converted into heat . under the am1.5 conditions , cooling down of the solar cells",
    "is due to radiation and convection , as a result of which the temperature of the solar cell notably decreases .",
    "however , apart from the cases of high wind velocity , the temperature of the solar cells under natural conditions exceeds the environment temperature by about 10@xmath18c .",

    "estimates obtained for the typical parameter values of the hit elements indicate that ( [ 2 ] ) is fulfilled for @xmath45 , which is the case in our hit elements .",

    "the relations hold : @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the equilibrium electron and hole densities , and @xmath12 is the excess electron - hole pair density in the si neutral region .    here and",
    "in the following we assume that the electron - hole pair diffusion length in hit elements , @xmath179 ( @xmath180 is hole diffusion coefficient , @xmath144 the lifetime ) , is much greater than the thickness of si wafer , i.e. @xmath11 . because of this , @xmath12 is the same at all @xmath181 .    in the short - circuit regime @xmath182 where @xmath24 is the short - circuit current density .",
    "substitution of the expressions ( [ 1 ] ) into this identity shows that the reduction of the coefficients @xmath183 and @xmath184 leads to the increase of the difference between the electron and hole densities on the contacts , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , inversely proportionally to to @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "the estimates for @xmath187ma/@xmath23 indicate that for @xmath188 , these differences are about @xmath189@xmath20 .",
    "although this is a rather high value , it is substantially smaller than the equilibrium densities @xmath178 and @xmath177 .",
    "this is called the accumulation effect , first pointed out at in @xcite . due to the accumulation effect , upon turning the illumination on , the short - circuit current saturates over the time scale necessary for the build - up of the difference @xmath190 , at which the tunneling current becomes equal to the generation current .",
    "we note that the relation ( [ 3a ] ) and the expression @xmath191 which is valid under the criterion ( [ 2 ] ) in the short - circuit regime allow one to find the dimensionless bend bending in the @xmath42 plane , @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath65 , we have @xmath192    fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows @xmath61 as a function of @xmath32 ad different values of @xmath175 . as seen in this figure , for @xmath193 , the inequality @xmath65 for all curves .",
    "that is , the criterion ( [ 2 ] ) , which ensures complete passage of the generation current through the wide - bandgap layer of @xmath0-si : h , also implies the smallness of @xmath194 in the short - circuit regime .",
    "we also note that if the coefficient @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the densities @xmath195 and @xmath175 are comparable , then , as calculations show , the criterion @xmath65 also implies that @xmath66 .    in the open - circuit regime , the relations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1a ] ) allow to find the respective dimensionless potentials at @xmath42 and @xmath64 as @xmath196 where @xmath70 is the excess electron - hole pair density in the open - circuit regime , with @xmath197 .",
