    "much can be learned about the behavior and evolution of an astronomical source through analysis of properly calibrated spectra .",
    "interpretation can lead to estimates of density and temperature conditions , the chemical composition , the dynamics , and the sources of energy that power the emitting object .",
    "such an interpretation requires modeling , with sufficiently high accuracy , the excitation and ionization balance of plasmas out of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "but ultimately , the accuracy of the models depends on the quality of the atomic / molecular data employed .    at present",
    ", atomic data exists for most spectral lines observed from the infrared to the x - rays .",
    "these data account for most processes leading to tens of thousands of transitions from all ionic stages of nearly all elements of the first five rows of the periodic table .",
    "however , this huge amount of data has been obtained primarily through theoretical calculations with only sparse checks against experimental measurements .    despite many advances in spectral modeling , mostly in terms of increased completeness and improved quality of atomic / molecular parameters ,",
    "a generalized quantitative estimate of uncertainties of the resultant models has not been provided . in recent years , a few authors have presented methods based on the monte carlo numerical technique for propagating uncertainties through spectral models , e.g. @xcite .",
    "as these techniques are very inefficient , their general applicability to complex spectral modeling is very limited . finding a general and efficient method for estimating uncertainties in spectral models is important for two reasons .",
    "first , the accuracy of atomic / molecular data must be known before reliable conclusions can be provided on physically realistic comparisons between theoretical and observed spectra . at present researchers can only provide best fits to observed spectra without much understanding of the uncertainties impacting the results .",
    "second , homogeneously accurate atomic data for all transitions of a complex and/or very large atomic system , like for example systems with multiple metastable levels ( e.g. fe ii ) or models with hundreds of energy levels as those needed in uv and x - ray spectroscopy , can not be obtained . in such models ,",
    "error propagation analysis of the spectrum could discriminate between a few critically important atomic transitions and the very large numbers of less consequential transitions .",
    "conversely , detailed error analysis could direct further theoretical and/or experimental efforts to selectivelly obtain specific atomic measures that would significantly improve spectral models , rather than trying to determine all possible rates at once .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the analytical solution to the uncertainties in level populations of a non - lte spectral model for assumed uncertainties in atomic parameters . in section 3",
    "we propose a mechanism to estimate the uncertainties in atomic / molecular data and we test this by the case of fe ii through extensive comparisons with observed spectra . in section 4",
    "we discuss the uncertainties in line emissivities and emission line ratio diagnostics .",
    "section 5 presents our conclusions .",
    "for the sake of clarity , the rest of the paper deals explicitly with the case of population balance by electron impact excitation followed by spontaneous radiative decay .",
    "it is also assumed that the plasma is optically thin .",
    "however , we note that our method can easily be extended to ionization balance computations , to additional excitation mechanisms such as continuum and bowen fluorescence , and to optically thick transitions .",
    "under steady - state balance the population , @xmath0 , of a level @xmath1 is given by @xmath2[popeq ] where @xmath3 is the electron density , @xmath4 is the einstein spontaneous radiative rate from level @xmath5 to level @xmath1 and @xmath6 is the electron impact transition rate coefficient for transitions from level @xmath5 to level @xmath1 . here",
    ", we assume that the electron velocity distribution follows the maxwell - boltzmann function , thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both proportional to a symmetrical effective collision strength , @xmath8 , which is the source of uncertainty in the collisional transition rates . assuming that the spectral model is arranged in increasing level energy order @xmath9 whenever @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the second term in the denominator of the above equation is the inverse of the lifetime of level @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "this is important because lifetimes are generally dominated by a few strong transitions , which are much more accurately determined than the weak transitions .",
    "thus , @xmath12 carries smaller uncertainties than individual a - values .",
    "then , equation ( 1 ) can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the so - called critical density of level @xmath1 and is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "the uncertainty in the population of level @xmath1 , @xmath16 , can be computed as @xmath17 \\\\      + \\sum_{j\\ne i }   \\left({\\partial n_i\\over \\partial a_{i , j}}\\right)^2 ( \\delta a_{i , j})^2 + \\sum_{k\\ne i } \\left({\\partial n_i\\over \\partial n_k}\\right)^2(\\delta n_k)^2 .",
    "\\end{split}\\]][leverr ] the first three terms on the right hand side of this equation represent direct propagation of uncertainties from atomic rates to or from level @xmath1 . the last term in the equation",
    "correlates the uncertainty in level @xmath1 with the uncertainties in the level populations of all other levels that contribute to it .",
    "then , @xmath18 \\end{split}\\]][leverr2 ] where @xmath19    this linear set of equations yields the uncertainties in the populations of all levels . before proceeding to solve these equations",
    "it is worth pointing out some important properties : ( 1 ) uncertainties are obtained relative to the computed level populations regardless of the normalization adopted for these .",
    "this is important because while some spectral models compute population relative to the ground level other models solve for normalized populations such that @xmath20 is either 1 or the total ionic abundance .",
    "though , the equation above is generally applicable regardless of the normalization adopted .",
    "( 2 ) in the high density limit , @xmath21 , the right hand side of the equation goes to zero , thus the population uncertainties naturally go to zero as the populations approach the maxwell - boltzmann values ( lte conditions ) .",
    "( 3 ) by having an analytical expression for the propagation of uncertainties one can do a detailed analysis of the spectral model to identify the key pieces of atomic data that determine the quality of the model for any plasma conditions . ( 4 ) the set of linear equations for the uncertainties needs to be solved only once for any set of conditions and the system is of the same size as that for the level populations .",
    "this is unlike monte carlo approaches that require solving population balance equations hundreds of times , which makes real - time computation of uncertanties impractical .",
    "the set of equations above can be readily solved by writing them as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and the matrix and vector elements of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by the equation [ leverr2 ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the populations and population uncertainties for the first four excited levels of o iii as a function of the electron density at a temperature of @xmath26 k. for this computation we have assumed 5% uncertainties in the lifetimes , 10% uncertainties in individual a - values , and 20% uncertainties in the effective collision strengths .",
    "the levels considered here are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "it is seen that levels 2 through 5 have maximum uncertainties , @xmath3020% , in the low density limit where the populations are determined by collisional excitations from the ground level . as the electron density increases thermalization of levels with similar energies and radiative cascades start becoming more important , which diminishes the contribution of uncertainties in collision strengths and enhances the importance of uncertainties in a - values . for high densities",
    "all population uncertainties naturally go to zero as the populations approach the boltzmann limit .",
    "another thing to notice is that , the population uncertainties exhibit multiple contributions and peaks as the metastable levels @xmath31 and @xmath32 become populated and the uncertainties in these propagate through higher levels .",
    "figure 2 shows the populations , relative to the ground level , and population uncertainties for the first eight excited levels of fe ii as a function of the electron density at a temperature of @xmath26 k. for these calculations we use atomic data as in @xcite and assume uncertainties of 5% in the lifetimes , 10% in individual a - values , and 20% in the effective collision strengths .",
    "the levels considered here are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "an interesting characteristic of the fe ii system is that the @xmath35 excited level is more populated , at least according to the atomic data adopted here , than the ground level at densities around @xmath26 @xmath36 , typical of h ii regions . moreover , under these conditions only @xmath3020% of the total fe ii abundance is in the ground level .",
    "this means that unlike lighter species , where excitation is dominated by the ground level or the ground multiplet , in fe ii all metastable levels are strongly coupled and uncertainties in atomic data are expected to propagate in a highly non - linear fashion .    in figure 3",
    "we present the population errors for the lowest 52 levels of fe ii at @xmath37 k and @xmath38 @xmath36 .",
    "these are all even parity metastable levels , except for the ground level .",
    "the figure shows the total estimated uncertainties together with the direct contributions from uncertainties in the collision strengths and a - values ( first and second terms on the right hand side of equation [ leverr ] ) and the contribution from level uncertainty coupling .",
    "it is observed that the collision strengths are the dominant source of uncertainty for all levels except level 6 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "for this level the uncertainty is dominated by the a - values and uncertainty couplings with levels of its own multiplet and levels of the ground multiplet .",
    "this is important because we find that the @xmath39 level makes the largest contribution to the uncertainties in 36 of the lowest 52 levels of fe ii .",
    "unfortunately , the atomic data for the @xmath40 level are among the most uncertain parameters of the whole fe ii system , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "in the previous section we adopted general uncertainties for lifetimes , a - values for forbidden transitions , and effective collision strengths of 5% , 10% , and 20% , respectively . in absence of",
    "generally accepted procedures to estimate uncertainties in theoretical atomic data , these kind of numbers are often cited in the literature as general guidelines ; however , uncertainty estimates on specific rates are rarely provided .",
    "in @xcite we proposed that uncertainties in gf - values could be estimated from the statistical dispersion among the results of multiple calculations with different methods and by different authors .",
    "the uncertainties can be refined by comparing with experimental or spectroscopic data whenever available , although these also have significant associated uncertainties .",
    "this approach is similar to what has been done for many years by the atomic spectroscopy data center at the nation institute of standards and technology ( nist ; http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm ) in providing a critical compilation of atomic data .    in estimating uncertainties from the dispersion of multiple results one must keep in mind some caveats : ( a ) small scatter among rates",
    "is obtained when the computations converge to a certain value , yet such a convergence is dependant on the maximum size of the quantum mechanical representation treatable at the time of the computation .",
    "thus , there is no guarantee that every seemingly converged result is indeed correct , as some values may result from local minima in the parameter space .",
    "( b ) large scatter among different calculations is expected in atomic rates where configuration interaction and level mixing lead to cancellation effects .",
    "the magnitude of these effects depends on the wave - function representation adopted .",
    "thus , some computations maybe a lot more accurate than others for certain transitions and if we knew which computation is the most accurate , then the scatter among all different computations may overestimate the true uncertainty .",
    "however , detailed information about configuration and level mixing for every transition is rarely available in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , in absense of complete information about every transition rate from every calculation , a critical comparison between the results of different calculations and other sources of data , if available , provides a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty in atomic / molecular rates .",
    "are the statistical dispersion values realistic uncertainty estimates ? to answer this question we look at the intensity ratios between emission lines from the same upper level as obtained from observed astronomical spectra and theoretical predictions .",
    "the advantage of looking at these ratios is that they depend only on the a - values , regardless of the physical conditions of the plasma .",
    "thus , the ratios ought to be the same in any spectra of any source , provided that the spectra have been corrected for extinction .",
    "fe ii yields the richest spectrum of all astronomically abundant chemical species .",
    "thus , high resolution optical and near - ir [ fe ii ] lines are the best suited for the present experiment .",
    "one hundred thirty seven [ fe ii ] lines are found in the hst / stis archived spectra of the weigelt blobs of @xmath41 carinae .",
    "six medium dispersion spectra ( @xmath42=6000 to 10,000 ) of the blobs were recorded between 1998 and 2004 at various orbital phases of the star s 5.5-year cycle .",
    "seventy eight [ fe ii ] lines are also present in the deep echelle spectrum ( @xmath42=30  000 ) of the herbig - haro object ( hh  202 ) in the orion nebula from @xcite .",
    "the importance of having multiple spectra from different sources and different instruments must not be overlooked .",
    "multiple measurements of the same line ratio minimize the likelihood of systematic errors due to unidentified blends , contamination from stellar emission , and instrumental effects .",
    "from the observations , there are 107 line ratios reasonably well measured from the spectra .",
    "the ratios are defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the measured fluxes of two lines from the same upper level . here , it is important that the minimum of the two fluxes is put in the denominator for the ratio .",
    "thus , the line ratios are unconstrained and they are all equally weighted when comparing with theoretical expectations .",
    "figure [ measure ] illustrates a few line ratio determinations from several measurements from spectra of @xmath41 carinae and hh  202 , as well as from various theoretical determinations . in practice , we perform up to four measurements of every observation for different spectral extractions along the ccd and different assumptions about the continuum and the noise levels . thus , we see that the scatter between multiple measurements of a given ratio greatly exceed the statistical uncertainties in the line flux integrations .",
    "moreover , the scatter between measured line ratios often exceeds the scatter between theoretical predictions .",
    "full details about the fe  ii spectra and measurement procedures will be presented in a forthcoming paper , where we will also present our recommended atomic data for fe  ii .    for the present work we consider seven different computations of a - values for fe ii .",
    "these are the superstructure and relativistic hartree - fock ( hfr ) calculations by @xcite , the recent civ3 calculation of @xcite , and various new hfr and autostructure calculations that extend over previous works .",
    "figure [ uncerfig ] presents a sample of theoretically calculated lifetimes and transition yields in fe ii .",
    "the yields are defined as @xmath46 . from the dispersion among various results ,",
    "the average uncertainty in lifetimes for all levels of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 configuration is 13% .",
    "more importantly , it is found that the uncertainty in the critically important @xmath39 level is @xmath49 , due to cancelation effects in the configuration interaction representation of the @xmath50 transition .",
    "we compared the observed line ratios described above with the predictions from different sets of theoretical a - values . without uncertainty",
    "estimates for the theoretical values , the reduced-@xmath51 values from these comparison range from 2.2 to 3100 for the different sets of a - values . on other hand , if one adopts average a - values from all calculations and uncertainties from the resultant standard deviations the reduced-@xmath51 is 1.03 .",
    "this is indicative of well estimated uncertainties , neither underestimated nor overestimated , and within these uncertainties there is good agreement between theoretical and experimental line ratios .",
    "the comparison between observed and theoretical line ratios , including uncertainties , is presented in figure [ aratios ] .",
    "figure [ errordist2 ] shows the estimated lifetime uncertainties for the lowest 52 levels of fe ii .",
    "the figure also presents the level population uncertainties that results from the present uncertainties in lifetimes and transition yields for a plasma with @xmath37 k and @xmath38 @xmath36 . here ,",
    "the adopted uncertainties in the collision strengths are kept at 20% for all transitions . by far",
    ", the most uncertain lifetime is that of the important @xmath39 level ( @xmath52 ) , yet the way that this uncertainty propagates through level populations depends on the density of the plasma . for electron densities",
    "much lower than the critical density for the level the uncertainty in the lifetime reflects directly on the level population for that level .",
    "this is seen at @xmath38 @xmath36 for levels @xmath3018 and higher . however , as the density increases the uncertainties in the level populations become incresingly dominated by the collision strengths .",
    "this effect is clearly illustrated in figure [ errorfe2b ] .",
    "the line emissivity , in units of photons per second , of a transition @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , is @xmath55[emisseq ] in computing the uncertainty in @xmath56 one must to account for the fact that @xmath0 and @xmath57 are correlated , because the latter appears in the denominator term of equation ( 1 ) that determines @xmath0 .",
    "this is important because the most frequently observed lines from any upper level are usually those that dominate the total decay rate for the level , i.e. , the inverse of the level s lifetime .",
    "it is convenient to re - write the above equation as @xmath58 combining this equation with equation [ leverr ] one finds @xmath59[emisser ] this equation can be readily evaluated from the level populations and uncertainties already known .",
    "the equation has various interesting properties : ( 1 ) the equation is independent of the physical units used for the emissivities ; ( 2 ) in the high density limit , as the uncertainty in the level population goes to zero , the uncertainty in the emissivity is the same as in the a - value .",
    "figure [ lineerror ] depicts uncertainties in emissivity for a sample of strong ir , near - ir , and optical [ fe ii ] lines .",
    "these are computed at @xmath26 k. the uncertainties in the collision strengths are 20% and the uncertainties in the lifetimes and a - values are those estimated in the previous section .",
    "the behavior of these uncertainties for different physical conditions is complex .",
    "let us look , for instance , at the uncertainty of emissivity of the 5.3@xmath60 m line ( @xmath50 ; @xmath61 ) whose behavior is contrary to the uncertainty in the population of the @xmath62 level ( see figure [ errorfe2b ] ) . according to equations [ popeq ] and [ emisseq ] , in the low density limit @xmath63 in the case of the @xmath39 level the 5.3@xmath60 m transition dominates the total decay rate of level and the ratio @xmath64 is essentially 1 .",
    "thus , the uncertainty in the @xmath65 rate cancels out at low electron densities and the uncertainty in the emissivity is small despite a large uncertainty in the level population .",
    "by contrast , at high densities the population of the level approaches the boltzmann limit and the uncertainty in the emissivity is solely given by that in @xmath65 , which is @xmath49 .",
    "a line emissivity ratio between two lines is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy difference between levels @xmath1 and @xmath68 and we have used emissivties in units of energy per second . in computing the uncertainty in this line ratio one must account for the fact that the emissivities are correlated . moreover , a general expression for the uncertainty must account for cases where @xmath69 , in which case the uncertainty in the ratio would depend only on the a - values .",
    "the uncertainty is the ratio is given by @xmath70 ^ 2 \\left({\\delta j_{i , f}\\over j_{i , f}}\\right)^2 + \\left[1-r\\left({\\partial j_{i , f}\\over \\partial j_{g , h}}\\right)\\right]^2 \\left({\\delta j_{g , h}\\over j_{g , h}}\\right)^2 ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 thus , @xmath72 ^ 2\\left ( { \\delta j_{i , f}\\over j_{i , f}}\\right)^2 + \\\\       \\left[1-r\\left({a_{i , f}\\delta e_{i , f}\\over a_{g , h}\\delta e_{g , h}}{\\partial n_i\\over \\partial n_g } +   { a_{i , f}\\delta_{i , f}\\over \\delta e_{g , h } n_g } { \\partial n_i\\over \\partial a_{g , h}}\\right)\\right]^2\\left ( { \\delta j_{g , h}\\over j_{g , h}}\\right)^2 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] from equation [ popeq ] we find @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and @xmath77 otherwise .    in the general case of a ratio involving several lines in the numerator and/or denominator , i.e. , @xmath78 the uncertainty is @xmath79    figure [ raterr ] shows a sample of line ratios between ir and optical lines and their uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties exhibit complex behaviour with changes in density and temperatures .",
    "in general , line ratios are only useful as diagnostics when the observed ratio lies around middle range of the theoretical ratio .",
    "moreover , it is very important to know the uncertainties in the ratios when selecting appropriate diagnostics from a given spectrum .",
    "we presented a method to compute uncertainties in spectral models from uncertainties in atomic / molecular data .",
    "our method is very efficient and allows us to compute uncertainties in all level populations by solving a single algebraic equation .",
    "specifically , we treat the case of non - lte models where electron impact excitation is balanced by spontaneous radiative decay .",
    "however , the method can be extended to ionization balance and additional excitation mechanisms .",
    "our method is tested in o iii and fe ii models , first by assuming commonly assumed uncertainties and then by adopting uncertainties in lifetimes and a - values given by the dispersion between the results of multiple independent computations .",
    "moreover , we show that uncertainties taken this way are in practice very good estimates",
    ".    then we derive analytic expresions for the uncertainties in line emissivities and line ratios .",
    "these equations take into account the correlations between level populations and line emissivities .",
    "interestingly , the behaviour of uncertainties in level populations and uncertainties in emissivities for transitions from the same upper levels are often different and even opposite .",
    "this is the case , in particular , for lines that result from transitions that dominate the total dacay rate of the upper level .",
    "then , the uncertainties in a - values for the transitions that yield the lines cancel out with the uncertainties in the lifetimes of the levels . in terms of emission line ratios",
    ", it is also found that knowledge of the uncertainties in the ratios is essential selecting appropriate ratios for density and temperature diagnostics .    at present",
    ", we are in the process of estimating uncertainties in atomic data for species of astronomical interest .",
    "our uncertainty estimates and analysis of the uncertainties in various spectral models , ionic abundance determinations , and dianostic line ratios will be presented in future publicaitons ."
