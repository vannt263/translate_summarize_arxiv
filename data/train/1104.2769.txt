    "the local density approximation ( lda ) ( ref .  ) in density functional theory ( dft ) ( ref .  ) has shown fantastic performance in understanding and even predicting material properties@xcite in spite of its relatively simple treatment of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath2 $ ] as a functional of the electron density @xmath3 ; e.g. , for many materials , lattice and elastic constants are generally reproduced .",
    "the deviations from experimental values are within less than 1 - 2 % and several percent , respectively , in lda .",
    "yet lda fails to describe some of properties including ground - state magnetic orderings even for bulk iron@xcite and for some transition - metal oxides.@xcite it also tends to overestimate the bonding strength , leading to an absolute error of molecular atomization energies.@xcite    some of limitations of lda are remedied by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in which the exchange - correlation energy is expressed in terms of not only the electron density but also its gradient .",
    "the molecular atomization energies are calculated with the error of several tenths of ev,@xcite and the ground state of the bulk iron is correctly predicted to be a ferromagnetic body - center phase.@xcite the prevailed functional form of gga ( pbe ) ( ref .  ) generally provides better accuracy for structural properties of variety of solids and activation energies in chemical reactions than lda does .    the local ( lda ) and semilocal ( gga ) approximations are still insufficient to describe some of important properties , however .",
    "the ground states of strongly correlated materials are incorrectly predicted and the energy band gaps of most semiconductors and insulators are substantially underestimated .",
    "the meta - gga scheme@xcite extending the exchange - correlation functionals with including the kinetic energy density further improves the lda and gga results for molecular systems@xcite but not succeed to remedy above failures in condensed matters .    the failure of lda and gga is occasionally discussed in terms of the self - interaction error ( sie).@xcite an electron is under the electrostatic potential due to other electrons . yet the expression of the electrostatic potential in the ( semi)local approximations includes the spurious interaction with the electron itself .",
    "when we consider the hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange potential with kohn - sham orbitals , this spurious self - interaction is cancelled by a term in the exchange potential . in the ( semi)local expression of the exchange potential , however , this cancellation is incomplete so that each electron is affected by the self - interaction .",
    "this sie causes delocalization of the electron , predicting the incorrect fractional - charged ground state of , e.g. , h@xmath4 with large nucleus separation.@xcite    the sie affects the band gaps substantially .",
    "the band gap @xmath5 is formally defined as the ionization energy subtracted by the electron affinity so that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total energy of the @xmath8-electron system . in dft with the exact exchange - correlation energy , the band gap is expressed as the difference between the highest occupied kohn - sham level @xmath9 of the @xmath10-electron system and its counterpart of the @xmath8-electron system @xmath11 : i.e. , @xmath12.@xcite when we introduce a fractional electron system with @xmath13 electrons as a mixed state of real integer - electron systems , then the total energy @xmath14 becomes linear for @xmath15 and shows discontinuity at the integer value @xmath8 for finite - gap systems .",
    "using janak theorem@xcite which relates the kohn - sham level to the derivative of the total energy as @xmath16 , the linearity of @xmath17 leads to the constant @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 . in the ( semi)local approximations , however , the kohn - sham level @xmath20 [ @xmath21 increases ( decreases ) with increasing @xmath19 due to the self - interaction , leading to the concave shape of @xmath14",
    "this may cause an underestimate of the energy gap.@xcite    the hf approximation ( hfa ) is free from the self - interaction . yet",
    "the calculated band gaps in hfa are substantially overestimated due to the lack of the correlation energy .",
    "an approach called the optimized effective potential@xcite which is incorporated in dft ( refs .  ) intending to remedy the issue is still in an immature stage in a view of applications to polyatomic systems .",
    "hence the hybrid functionals combining lda or gga with hfa may be effective to break the limitation of the semilocal approximations .",
    "the hybrid approach has begun in empirical ways : the hf - exchange energy was mixed with the lda exchange - correlation energy in the half and half way@xcite and then three mixing parameters were introduced@xcite to mix the lda , gga , and hfa energies ; the latter scheme is called b3lyp and has widely been used to clarify thermochemical properties of molecules.@xcite a rationale for the hybrid functional is provided@xcite in the light of the adiabatic - connection theorem,@xcite @xmath22 = \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\lambda \\ e_{\\rm xc,\\lambda } \\ , \\label{adconn}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the energy of the exchange and correlation in a system , where the electron - electron interaction @xmath24 is reduced by the factor @xmath25 but the external potential @xmath26 is added to reproduce the electron density @xmath27 of the real system ( @xmath28 ) . here @xmath29 is the ground - state many - body wave function . by assuming that @xmath30 is the 4th polynomial of @xmath25 with particular asymptotic forms for @xmath31 and @xmath28 , perdew , ernzerhof , and becke have proposed a parameter - free hybrid functional called pbe0@xcite in which the hf and pbe exchange energies are mixed with the ratio of 1:3 .",
    "its applicability has been examined for molecular systems.@xcite    screening of the coulomb potential is effective in polyatomic systems .",
    "hence it may be effective to apply the non - local hf - exchange operator only to the short - range part of the coulomb potential.@xcite this is conveniently done by introducing the error function splitting the coulomb potential into short - range and long - range components .",
    "the hybrid functional which is constructed in this way from the pbe0 functional is proposed by heyd , sucseria , and ernzerhof ( hse).@xcite this treatment reduces computational cost substantially and opens a possibility to apply the hybrid functionals to condensed matters .",
    "the structural properties as well as the band gaps of several solids have been calculated and significant improvements on semi - local functionals are achieved.@xcite    on the other hand , effects of the exchange interaction for the long - range component of the coulomb potential are certainly important@xcite in a view of reducing sie .",
    "hirao and his collaborators have proposed a long - range corrected ( lc ) functional in which the long - range component is treated by the hf exchange energy and the short - range component is by the lda exchange.@xcite they have applied to various molecular systems and obtained relatively successful results.@xcite further application of the lc functional to molecular systems and its comparison with other functionals have been done and the applicability of the lc functional have been recognized.@xcite the lc functional has also been applied to structural properties and band gaps of several condensed matters and the results are compared with those obtained from other functionals.@xcite    at the present stage , several hybrid functionals have been implemented in different packages and the assessment of the validity of each functional has been done mainly to molecular systems .",
    "applicability of the pbe0 and hse functionals to condensed matters have been examined.@xcite the structural and electronic properties such as lattice constants , bulk moduli , and also the band gaps of condensed matters are obtained only after careful examinations of various calculation parameters .",
    "obviously , numerical precision should not be neglected .",
    "in order to assess the validity of each hybrid functional , it is thus imperative to perform the computation in a single reliable calculation scheme . furthermore , the split of the coulomb potential into the short - range and long - range parts requires another parameter @xmath32 being the exponent of the error function .",
    "the @xmath32 dependence of the results should certainly be examined for better understanding and further improvements on the hybrid functionals .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to implement several important hybrid functionals in the well - established plane - wave - basis total - energy band - structure calculation code and examine validity and limitation of each functional .",

    "( [ pbe0_formula ] ) , the pbe0 hybrid functional is given by @xmath45 leading to the mixing of 25 % hf exchange and 75 % pbe exchange .",
    "heyd , sucseria , and ernzerhof have proposed@xcite a different hybrid functional in which the long - range part of the hf - exchange energy is treated by the semilocal approximation in dft and the short - range part is calculated exactly .",
    "the actual procedure is conveniently done by splitting the coulomb potential as @xmath46 and applying the first term only , i.e. , the screened coulomb potential , to the hf - exchange energy . the second term to the exchange energy is calculated with gga .",
    "adopting the mixing ratio in pbe0 , then the hse hybrid functional becomes @xmath47 @xmath48 is the fock - type double integral with the screened coulomb potential .",
    "there is some complexity to divide the pbe exchange energy @xmath49 into the short - range part @xmath50 and the long - range part @xmath51 .",
    "the dividing procedure will be shown in subsection [ srlr ] .",

    "the hse functional partly removes sie by incorporating the hf - exchange energy in the pbe functional .",
    "yet the cancellation of the hartree potential and the exchange potential is absent in the long - range part .",
    "this may cause erroneous description of , e.g. , the rydberg states in isolated polyatomic systems or properties of charge - transfer systems . to remedy this point , application of the long - range part of the coulomb potential to the hf - exchange energy is necessary .",

    "non - locality of the hf - exchange potential generally increases computational cost tremendously in the application to condensed matters .",
    "we have circumvented this problem using the fast - fourier transform ( fft ) , as explained below .",
    "the long - range nature of the coulomb potential leads to singularity of its fourier transform at the origin .",

    "we here adopt a simple truncation scheme to overcome the problem .",

    "we also show the calculated energy bands of the dielectric compound batio@xmath135 and the ionic insulator nacl in figs .",
    "[ batio3_band ] and [ nacl_band ] , respectively .",
    "we find the general tendency similar to that in si : i.e. , the overall features of the energy bands are insensitive to the difference in the functionals ; the lc functional provides larger energy gaps compared with the hse functional .",
    "table  [ bandgap ] and [ bandwidth ] summarize the calculated bandwidths and band gaps for the ten materials .",
    "for assessment of validity of each functional , it is convenient to introduce two quantities , the mean relative error ( mre ) which is the mean of the calculated value minus the experimental value over the ten materials , and the mean absolute relative error ( mare ) which is the mean of the absolute value of the difference between the calculated and the experimental values over the ten materials .",
    "the mre is a measure of under- or over - estimates of the experimental values since each functional predicts either smaller or larger values than the experimental values for most of the ten materials . on the other hand , mare is a measure of closeness between the calculated and experimental values . in the discussion below , we categorize the ten materials into group i and group ii : group i , i.e. , diamond , gan , batio@xmath0 , si and ge has covalent characters in which the band gaps are less than 7 ev ; group ii , i.e. , lif , kr , nacl , licl and mgo , consists of ionic solids and a rare - gas solid in which the experimental band gaps are larger than 7 ev .",
    "the calculated band gap by the pbe functional for each material is substantially smaller than the corresponding experimental value , as is reported in literature .",
    "the calculated mre for the ten materials is @xmath13342.5 % . on the other hand ,",
    "hfa largely overestimates the band gaps for all the ten materials : mre is 179.7 % .",

    "the calculated mre by the pbe0 for the materials in group i is 25.4 % , whereas it gives @xmath13314.0 % for the materials in group ii .",
    "the hse and lc functional also provide better agreement of the band gap with the experiments than the pbe does .",
    "further when we choose optimum values of @xmath32 , the hse and lc results show nice agreement with the experimental values . in the hse functional ,",
    "a general trend is the decrease in the band gap with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "we have found that the value @xmath32 = 0.1 @xmath52 produces the band gaps close to the experimental values within mre = 0.9 % for the materials in group i. it produces worse values for the materials in group ii .",
    "the calculated mre is @xmath13319.0 % for the materials in group ii , but still hse being the better approximation than pbe .",
    "the lc functional provides good agreement with the experimental values for the materials in group ii : when we choose the optimum value of @xmath136 , the calculated mre is nicely small , 4.4 % for the materials in group ii .",
    "yet the lc provides worse values for the materials in group i , showing its limitation as an universally valid approximation .",
    "figure  [ theory_vs_expt ] is a summary of our calculated band gaps by the pbe , hse and lc functionals .",
    "for hse and lc , we show the calculated results with the optimum @xmath32 values : @xmath32 = 0.1 @xmath52 for hse and @xmath32 = 0.2 @xmath52 for lc .",
    "it is clearly shown that the calculated band gaps by hybrid functionals , hse and lc , are in better agreement with the experimental values than the pbe ( gga ) approximation , indicating the promising possibility of the hybrid functionals .",
    "the degree of the agreement is close to the greens - function - based gw approximation in which there are several ambiguities in theoretical treatments.@xcite however , this figure also shows the limitation ; hse is reasonably good for only the group i materials , whereas lc is good for only the group ii materials .",
    "our finding here is that hse is a good approximation for relatively small - gap materials and that lc is a good approximation for the relatively large - gap materials .",
    "screening of the coulomb interaction depends on the materials .",
    "hence the best treatment of the short - range and long - range parts of the coulomb interactions should change material by material .",
    "what we have found here is natural in the sense .",
    "however , another point we have shown here is that the appropriate choice of @xmath32 with each exchange - correlation functional provides reasonable agreement with the calculated band gaps for rather wide range of materials ; hse with @xmath32 @xmath137 0.1 @xmath52 for the materials with their band gaps smaller than 7 ev and lc with @xmath32 @xmath137 0.2 @xmath52 for the materials with their band gaps",

    "this information certainly provides a practical recipe to obtain reliable band gaps for various materials .        the calculated bandwidths by the pbe functional are in good agreements with the experimental values available ( table  [ bandwidth ] ) .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study that clarifies validity and limitation of current hybrid functionals in density functional theory for structural and electronic properties of various semiconductors and insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the three hybrid functionals , pbe0 by perdew , ernzerhof , and becke , hse by heyd , sucseria , and ernzerhof , and a long - range corrected ( lc ) functional , are implemented in a well - established plane - wave - basis - set scheme combined with norm - conserving pseudopotentials , thus enabling us to assess applicability of each functional on equal footing to the properties of the materials . </S>",
    "<S> the materials we have examined in this paper range from covalent to ionic materials as well as a rare - gas solid whose energy gaps determined by experiments are in the range of 0.6 ev - 14.2 ev : i.e. , ge , si , batio@xmath0 , @xmath1-gan , diamond , mgo , nacl , licl , kr , and lif . we find that the calculated bulk moduli by the hybrid functionals show better agreement with the experiments than the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) provides , whereas the calculated lattice constants by the hybrid functionals and gga show comparable accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated energy band gaps and the valence - band widths for the ten prototype materials show substantial improvement using the hybrid functional compared with gga . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is found that the band gaps of the ionic materials as well as the rare - gas solid are well reproduced by the lc - hybrid functional , whereas those of covalent materials are well described by the hse functional . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine exchange effects due to short - range and long - range components of the coulomb interaction and propose an optimum recipe to the short - range and long - range separation in treating the exchange energy .    </S>",
