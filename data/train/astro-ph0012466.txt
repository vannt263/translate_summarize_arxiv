    "scenarios incorporating the orbital migration of giant planets have been proposed to explain the orbit of pluto and the eccentricity distribution of kuiper belt objects ( @xcite ) , as well as the small orbital semi - major axes of many of the newly discovered extra - solar planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "a theory of resonant capture exists for well defined adiabatically varying non - chaotic integrable resonant systems ( similar to pendulums , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it now known that due to multiple resonance overlaps some of the mean - motion resonances in the solar system are in fact chaotic ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . from their numerical integration",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that the chaotic nature of the resonances did influence the capture probabilities of resonances driving the evolution of the uranian satellites .",
    "@xcite showed that the uranian satellites were temporarily captured into the chaotic zone associated with the separatrix of a resonance . because chaotic resonances will always temporarily capture particles into their chaotic zones , the dynamics is fundamentally different than that of integrable resonances where no capture takes place unless the phase space volume of the resonance grows .",
    "previous theoretical work on the capture process during orbital migration has been restricted to integrable models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , by numerically investigating toy hamiltonian models , we explore the general problem of capture by chaotic resonances .    in our previous work we investigated numerically the affect of an orbiting giant planet on planetesimals interior to the planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "we showed that the strong mean - motion resonances captured particles and caused catastrophic events such as ejection by the planet or an impact with the central star .",
    "we proposed that because impacts can enrich the metallicity of a star at a time when the star is no longer fully convective , the migration process offers an explanation for the high metallicities of stars with planets discovered via radial velocity searches .",
    "the theory of adiabatically varying integrable systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) predicts permanent capture probabilities for integrable mean - motion resonances .",
    "however from our simulation we found that particles were often captured only for short periods of time .",
    "this was particularly evident in the simulations with slow migration rates .",
    "we can try to understand the problem with the understanding that the strong drifting resonances in the problem contain large chaotic zones . as we show below",
    ", when there is a chaotic zone , the probability of temporary capture into the resonance is 100% . because a chaotic zone is incapable of permanently capturing particles in a drifting resonance",
    ", we expect that the probability of permanent capture drops as the width of the chaotic zone increases .",
    "we expect that the distribution of temporarily capture times and the probability of permanent capture depends on the width and variation of the chaotic zone , the drift rate of the planet , and the distribution of diffusion timescales in the zone .",
    "these phenomena can be illustrated simply with a mathematical model for the forced pendulum .",
    "this is a simple two dimensional hamiltonian system which exhibits the chaos caused by resonant overlap ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath0\\cos(\\psi ) \\\\       & = & { 1 \\over 2 } p^2 + k\\cos(\\psi ) + { ka \\over 2 } \\left [   \\cos(\\psi+\\nu t)+ \\cos(\\psi-\\nu t )    \\right ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and has resonances at @xmath1 with @xmath2 . to drift the resonance we modify the hamiltonian @xmath3\\cos(\\psi )   + b p. \\label{ham_2d}\\ ] ] for the resonance to migrate or drift , @xmath4 must be a function of t. we can allow the resonance to grow without changing its shape if we set @xmath5 and @xmath6 ..    in figure 1",
    "we show the result of drifting two different systems , one with a large chaotic zone and the other without .",
    "we numerically integrated the above hamiltonian using a conventional burlisch - stoer numerical scheme .",
    "both numerical integrations pertain to systems with constant resonant widths and shapes ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "since the size and shape of the resonance does not change with time , the capture probability predicted for a non - chaotic resonance is zero ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however when the chaotic zone is large , particles can spend a significant amount of time in the chaotic zone associated with the separatrix before passing to the other side of the resonance .",
    "we can define an effective width for the chaotic zone as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the volume in phase space of the chaotic zone connected to the separatrix .",
    "particles spend different time periods temporarily captured in the chaotic zone .",
    "the distribution of temporary capture times has a lower edge at nearly zero time in the resonance .",
    "the mean length of time captured into the resonance is @xmath10 when the shape of the resonance is held fixed .",
    "because the chaotic zone may contain regions with different diffusion timescales , we expect that the final particle distribution will have a dependence on drift rate . to explore this we performed integrations for 3 different drift rates for the system shown on the right hand side of figure 1 .",
    "the final particle probability distributions are shown in figure 2 .",
    "for the faster drift rates , the final particle distribution is nearly flat , however for the slower drift rates , the distribution is more triangular and has a longer tail . in the longer integrations we expect that particles can be trapped in regions with longer diffusion timescales .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , we can estimate the capture probability for an adiabatically drifting resonance by considering the volume of phase space per unit time which is passed by the separatrices of the resonance .",
    "we are referring to a system with 2 separatrices ( the non - chaotic example shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "for @xmath11 and @xmath12 the momenta of the upper and lower separatrices as a function of angle and time , the rate of volume swept by the upper separatrix is @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the growth rate of phase space volume in the resonance is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the corresponding expression for the lower separatrix .",
    "particles swept up by the resonance must either be captured or ejected .",
    "the capture rate depends on the ratio of volume increase in the resonance to that swept up by the resonance and so is given by @xmath17    this is shown with more rigor by @xcite for the drifting pendulum ( hamiltonian in equation ( [ ham_2d ] ) restricted to @xmath18 ) .",
    "the probability of capture @xmath19 where @xmath20 we have assumed that particles start at large @xmath21 and the growing resonance ( @xmath22 ) drifts upwards ( @xmath23 ) . if the resonance shrinks , @xmath24 , then the permanent capture probability is zero .",
    "we have computed permanent capture probabilities for a series of systems with different sized chaotic zones by choosing different values for @xmath25 in each system .",
    "since we do not allow @xmath25 to vary in each individual simulation , the shape ( not size ) of the resonance remains the same while the resonance drifts .",
    "for these simulations we set @xmath26 such that when @xmath18 the probability of capture is @xmath27 .",
    "we see in figure 3 that the permanent capture probability of the resonance drops when it has an decreasing volume fraction covered by integrable motion or stable islands .",
    "the fraction of the resonance covered by islands drops exponentially as @xmath28 so the capture probability exponentially approaches 1 for small @xmath25 .",
    "when the resonance contains a chaotic separatrix , we expect its permanent capture probability to differ from that of a resonance of similar shape lacking a chaotic separatrix . in the limit of an entirely chaotic resonance ,",
    "the resonance can not permanently capture particles unless the resonance width grows faster than the drift rate and the resonance is effectively stationary .",
    "a drifting resonance requires a stable , integrable , non - chaotic , growing island to capture particles .",
    "we expect the capture probability to be given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the growth rate of the island or islands of non - chaotic phase space volume , and @xmath13 is the rate that particles are swept into the chaotic zone of the resonance .",
    "when the volume of the chaotic zone shrinks to zero we recover the formalism of the integrable model .",
    "@xcite proposed that neptune s outwards migration was responsible for the capture of pluto and other kuiper belt objects into the 3:2 and 2:1 mean - motion resonances with neptune . because the capture probability predicted with the integrable formalism",
    "is 1 for low eccentricity objects , particles are not expected to escape the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the existence of low eccentricity objects between 45 - 47 au , just within the 2:1 resonance , has posed a challenge to explain .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical simulations of the migrating major planets by @xcite and @xcite showed that particles with initially low eccentricity could pass through this resonance .",
    "@xcite suggested that the stochastic migration rate of neptune seen in their simulations might result in particles leaving the 2:1 resonance , however the simulation with a smooth migration by @xcite still showed that low eccentricity particles could avoid capture .",
    "numerical integrations have shown that on long timescales ( 4 gyrs ) the 2:1 is possibly entirely chaotic ( @xcite ) . based on our understanding of our toy problems",
    "we may be able to offer an alternative explanation for passage of particles through the 2:1 resonance even when neptune s migration is smooth .",
    "the numerical simulations of the 2 dimensional toy model we discussed above were in the regime @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( see equation ( [ ham_2d ] ) ) .",
    "this regime is appropriate for the asteroid belt ( @xcite ) and for the simulation of inwards orbital migration of a jovian sized giant planet ( as by @xcite ) .",
    "however in the kuiper belt secular oscillation frequencies are slow compared to the mean - motion resonance oscillation frequencies .",
    "if the simple model described by equation([ham_2d ] ) were appropriate we would expect @xmath33 and that the resonances are highly overlapped . in this regime on long timescales",
    "the resonance is entirely chaotic .",
    "however , on short timescales we can consider the resonance to be a slowly varying integrable system . in this case",
    "we could use the formalism for calculating capture for slowly varying separatrices ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even though the secular oscillations frequencies are slow in the kuiper belt , the edges of the resonances are still found numerically to exhibit chaotic motion even on the short timescales of millions of years ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so the theory of capture in the regime of slowly varying separatrices , is still not applicable to the theory of capture by kuiper belt resonances .",
    "the numerical integrations ( e.g. @xcite on the 3:2 and @xcite on the 2:1 resonances ) show that the problem is not as simple as a simple model of multiple resonances restricted to a few terms and that even on short timescales , the resonances contain fairly wide chaotic zones .",
    "when a resonance contains regions with widely different diffusion timescales , the problem is more complicated than illustrated with our simple 2d model explored above . however if the migration rate is fast compared to the diffusion timescale in a particular region of phase space , we can consider that region to be integrable .",
    "this is equivalent to modeling the resonance as a series of overlapped resonances with different frequencies , and ignoring the terms with the slowest frequencies .",
    "if a particle can remain in a region of libration for @xmath34 years then for orbital migration rates such that the resonance is passed on this timescale ( @xmath35 years , for @xmath36 the width of the resonance and @xmath37 the resonance migration rate ) we can consider that region to be integrable , and so capable of capturing particles . for low initial particle eccentricities , @xmath38 , @xcite found that about a fifth of phase space was likely to be chaotic in the 2:1 resonance on fairly short timescales .",
    "in other words , @xcite found no regions of stable libration for about 1/5 of possible values for the resonant angle . even though the integrable model predicts a 100% capture probability for @xmath39 ,",
    "if 1/5 of the resonance is chaotic , then the capture probability is likely to be only @xmath40 for migration rates @xmath41 years .",
    "this is one way that low eccentricity objects could pass through the 2:1 resonance , and a possible explanation for low eccentricity kuiper belt objects between 45 - 47 au which should have been previously captured in the 2:1 resonance by neptune s migration .    following a period of fairly swift migration , it is likely that neptune underwent migration at a slower rate .",
    "for slower migration rates we can consider a larger fraction of the 2:1 resonance to be chaotic and the capture probability will be even smaller .",
    "particles pumped to high eccentricity while caught in the resonance , can subsequently escape .",
    "in our previous simulations ( @xcite ) we saw that particles could be temporarily captured , have their eccentricities increase while in the resonance and then could escape with eccentricities that were not neccessarily well above their initial value .",
    "any objects released at high eccentricity from the 2:1 resonance in the kuiper belt would not be observed today . because of their high eccentricities , following escape from the resonance they would be likely to suffer encounters with neptune .",
    "low eccentricity particles which escaped the 2:1 resonance are likely to remain in stable orbits for the age of the solar system .",
    "the remaining objects we expect to find today should either reside in stable high eccentricity regions of the 2:1 resonance or at low eccentricity inside the semi - major axis of this resonance .",
    "as the observational constraints on the orbital elements of kuiper belt objects improve , we expect it will be possible to numerically explore the validity of this kind of scenario . because of the different different diffusion timescales in the resonance , such a study may provide constraints on neptune s migration rate as a function of time .",
    "the celestial dynamics problem restricted to the plane containing the planet and sun is a 4 not 2 dimensional problem .",
    "oscillations in semi - major axis are coupled to those in eccentricity .",
    "while a particle is temporarily captured into a resonance , large excursions in eccentricity can also take place ( as discussed by @xcite and @xcite ) .    to illustrate what happens in the 4 dimensional system we explore a toy model with hamiltonian similar to that given in equation ( 27 ) of @xcite @xmath42\\cos(\\psi )",

    "@xmath46 corresponds to the precession frequency and is given by secular theory , and @xmath47 depends on the order of the resonance . in the celestial dynamics problem , @xmath48 and @xmath25 instead of being constants would be functions of the semi - major axis or @xmath21 . if we do a cannonical transformation to variables @xmath49 ; @xmath50 for @xmath51 then we recover a hamiltonian in the form @xmath52 .",
    "this hamitonian is the integral model often used to estimate capture probabilities into kth order mean - motion resonances ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an integration of the 4 dimensional hamiltonian given above with initial conditions @xmath53 so that it is close analogy with the two dimensional analog discussed above , yields phenomenology ( see figure 4 ) remarkably similar to that we observed in our orbital migration numerical integrations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we see in figure 4 that when temporary capture takes places there tends to be an increase in the mean value of @xmath43 .",
    "after capture @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the value of the hamiltonian and @xmath56 is the centre of the resonance when capture takes place . since excursions in @xmath43 can take place , resulting in a wider resonance , particles can remain in the resonance for longer times than possible in the two dimensional analog .",
    "the resulting momentum probability distributions are broader ( shown in figure 5 ) , particularly when the migration rates are slow .",
    "because @xmath43 is related to the particle eccentricity , excursions in @xmath43 represent excursions in eccentricity which could result in catastrophic events such as encounters with a planet or star . if the eccentricity undergoes a random walk once a particle is captured into the resonance ( as discussed in the diffusion model by @xcite ) , then when the capture time is long compared to the diffusion timescale , catastrophic events would be more likely to occur . in this situation",
    "the dynamics would be strongly dependent upon the planet s orbital migration rate .",
    "@xcite discusses the diffusion timescale in terms of the lyapunov time which for the simulations shown in figures 4 and 5 is @xmath57 .",
    "the slower drift rate integrations shown in figure 5 represent cases where particles are trapped for many lyapunov times .",
    "this may explain why their final momentum probability distributions exhibit larger tails .",
    "we now discuss the phenomenology seen in our previous numerical simulations ( @xcite ) . though initial particle eccentricities were fairly low , @xmath58 , because we chose planet eccentricities of @xmath59 for many of the simulations , the forced eccentricities were high and the mean initial eccentricities tended to be @xmath60 . the integrable model ( @xcite )",
    "predicts a 100% capture probability for a jupiter mass planet into the 3:1 resonance for eccentricities less than @xmath61 .",
    "therefore we expect fairly low permanent capture probabilities of @xmath62 into this resonance ( @xcite ) . for the 3:1 mean - motion resonance with a jovian sized planet ,",
    "the lyapunov timescale ( which is related to the secular oscillation frequency , @xcite ) is about @xmath63 times the planet period . for a resonance width that is about 0.02",
    "the radius of the planet , we expect temporary capture to last a time of @xmath64 planet periods which is only 20 lyapunov times for a migration rates @xmath65 given in units of the initial planet orbital period .",
    "for most of the simulations , temporary capture times were fairly short and deviations in eccentricity caused by temporary capture into the chaotic zone were limited .",
    "we also did 2 simulations with slower migration rates of @xmath66 . in these simulations particles",
    "are expected to remain in the chaotic zone for longer , @xmath67 lyapunov times . in the slower migration simulations we saw more examples of resonances temporarily capturing particles .",
    "the probability of capture into the 3:1 ( including temporary captures ) was larger than that predicted from the integrable theory ( using rough numbers from table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations showed that some of the temporary captures resulted in catastrophic events such as encounters with the planet or star . as expected from the final momentum distributions shown in figure 5 , in the slower simulations , the passage of the resonances heated the eccentricities and semi - major axis distribution to a larger extent than in the faster migration rate simulations .",
    "we conclude that the chaotic zone in is likely to have the strongest affect for slow migration rates .",
    "we expect large deviations from the predictions of integrable capture theories when the chaotic zone is large and the migration rates is sufficiently long that many lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily captured in the resonance .    in the simulations shown in figures 4 and 5 , because @xmath48 and @xmath25 are constants , the size of the resonance does not change as @xmath21 varies . if we allowed @xmath48 and @xmath25 to be functions of @xmath21 we could allow the size of the resonant islands to grow as the resonance drifts .",
    "this would then would allow the integrable islands in the resonance to capture particles for longer periods of time .",
    "the separation between overlapping resonances ( here described by @xmath46 ) is given by secular theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) and so will not vary quickly once a particle is trapped in one of the integrable islands .",
    "however , as the eccentricity grows , the widths of the individual sub - resonances will also grow and the resonances will overlap to a larger degree .",
    "we therefore expect the size of the chaotic region to grow after a particle is trapped in the resonance .",
    "because the volume in the integrable islands will at some time shrink instead of growing , particles will eventually escape the resonance .",
    "this provides a complete analogy for the process of resonant capture and escape that we saw in our previous simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "by exploring toy hamiltonian systems we have shown how the capture process is fundamentally different for drifting chaotic resonances than for drifting integrable systems .",
    "previous theoretical work on resonant capture has been limited to integrable models . in this paper , we have illustrated how an understanding of the structure in phase space of a resonance can be used to generalize this integrable theory to include the richer phenomenology of a chaotic resonance .",
    "\\1 ) we have shown that particles are temporarily captured into the chaotic zone of a drifting resonance . for a resonance of fixed shape ,",
    "the capture time depends on the effective width of the zone and the drift rate .",
    "in fact , temporary capture will take place even when the resonant width is shrinking .",
    "this is not true in the case of an integrable resonance .",
    "\\2 ) the permanent capture probability of a resonance depends on the ratio of phase space volume growth rate in its integrable islands compared to that swept up by the resonance .",
    "this implies that permanent capture probabilities are lower for resonances containing larger chaotic zones than those estimated from drifting integrable models .",
    "this offers a possible explanation for the passage of particles through the 2:1 resonance in the kuiper belt following migration by neptune , and for the temporary captures seen in our previous simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the continued migration of a planet via ejection of planetesimals depends on the fraction of particles remaining after a strong resonance has swept through the disk . since catastrophic events such as close encounters with a planet or star",
    "can take place during temporary resonant capture , and because particles are more likely to escape drifting chaotic resonances , the dynamics of migrating systems may be strongly influenced by this process .",
    "we expect the largest deviations from the predictions of integrable capture theories when the chaotic zones are large and migration rates are sufficiently long that many lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily captured in the resonance .",
    "\\3 ) the passage of chaotic resonances results in a heating of the particle momentum distribution .",
    "the momentum distribution width is increased by the effective momentum width of the chaotic zone .",
    "the final momentum distribution shape is dependent on the drift rate .    in this work",
    "we have numerically explored some simple drifting hamiltonian systems .",
    "we suspect that the final momentum distributions of a drifting chaotic resonance is sensitive to the the distribution of diffusion times in the resonance",
    ". one way to explore this possibility would be to numerically investigate toy models with different structure in their chaotic zones .    in future , by exploring in detail the timescales and structure of solar systems resonances , and comparing the results of numerical simulations with the observed distribution of objects , we suspect that the form of orbital migration of the planets may be constrained .",
