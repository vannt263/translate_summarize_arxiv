    "we start with a regular lattice ; on each site @xmath4 lives a random energy @xmath5 , drawn independently from site to site from a common distribution @xmath6 .",
    "we assume @xmath6 is continuous and normalized to unity , i.e. @xmath7 . for any choice of the set of @xmath5 s we obtain an energy landscape , i.e. , a topological space ( defined through nearest neighbors on the lattice ) with an energy for each element . for a given realization of the landscape ,",
    "a site @xmath4 is a local minimum if @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes any nearest neighbour sites of @xmath4 .",
    "hereafter we shall denote by @xmath2 the number of local minima on this landscape .",
    "for any given realization of the landscape , one can formally express @xmath2 as @xmath10 where the product runs over all nearest neighbours @xmath9 of site @xmath4 and @xmath11 is the heaviside theta function .",
    "we are interested in computing the probability distribution @xmath12 of the total number of local minima ( or equivalently that of the maxima ) .",
    "the first important observation is that the distribution @xmath12 is completely independent of the energy distribution @xmath6 . to see this",
    ", we formally express the distribution as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dirac delta function .",
    "next we make a change of variable for each @xmath15 @xmath16 clearly @xmath17 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 . moreover , since @xmath6 is normalized to unity , the variable @xmath20 varies from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and so eq .  ( [ m2 ] ) simply becomes @xmath23 we see that the energy distribution @xmath6 simply drops out and @xmath12 , for arbitrary @xmath6 , is universal and is the same as when the ` new ' energy variable @xmath24 is drawn independently from a uniform distribution over @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "thus , the model is simplified : at each lattice site lives a random number @xmath26 $ ] drawn independently from a uniform distribution",
    ". we will refer to this model as the random minima model , for which we want to compute the distribution @xmath12 of the total number of local minima .",
    "following the mapping to the uniform distribution , it follows that the random minima model is just the continuous version of the permutation generated landscape recently studied by hivert et .",
    "they considered a set of integers @xmath27 .",
    "each of the @xmath28 permutations of this set defines a random energy landscape and they occur with equal probability . thus the energy at a site is now a discrete integer drawn uniformly from the set @xmath29 $ ] with equal probability @xmath30 .",
    "thus the statistics of the minima in the permutation generated landscape will be identical to that of the random minima model .",
    "the mean and the variance of @xmath2 are relatively straightforward to compute on an arbitrary lattice since they depend only on the local properties of the landscape . to see this ,",
    "let us define the variable @xmath31 where @xmath9 runs over the nearest neighbours of @xmath4 and the @xmath24 s are independent random numbers in @xmath32 $ ] drawn from the uniform distribution .",
    "this @xmath33 is an indicator function which is 1 if site @xmath4 is a local minimum and 0 otherwise .",
    "then it follows that @xmath34 taking the average in eq .",
    "( [ mean1 ] ) and using the translational invariance of the lattice , it follows that @xmath35^n = \\frac{1}{n+1 } \\label{mean2}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the number of nearest neighbours of any site , i.e. , the co - ordination number of the lattice .",
    "this result also follows trivially from a combinatorial argument on the permutation landscape : consider the site @xmath4 with its @xmath36 neighbours .",
    "the number of ways one can arrange the integers on these @xmath37 sites with the restriction that @xmath4 is a local minimum is @xmath38 clearly . on the other hand , the total number of unrestricted configurations is @xmath39 so the probability that the site @xmath4 is a minimum is simply @xmath40 .",
    "the calculation of the variance takes a few more steps . squaring eq .",
    "( [ mean1 ] ) and taking the average gives @xmath41 note that the @xmath33 s are correlated random variables but only over a short range .",
    "the calculation of the correlation function @xmath42 can therefore be performed by hand ( it only involves the calculation of simple integrals involving a maximum of @xmath43 sites ) .",
    "for example , in @xmath22-d , one gets @xmath44 this result has been obtained in various contexts before , such as in the calculation of the number of metastable states in @xmath22-d ising spin glass  @xcite and also in the context of the occupation time of a non - markovian sequence in @xmath22-d  @xcite .",

    ", one expects that @xmath12 has the form @xmath56 \\label{ld1}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a large deviation function .",
    "now , on a given lattice , @xmath2 can take values from @xmath21 to a maximal number @xmath58 .",
    "the upper limit follows from the fact that once a site is a local minimum , none of its nearest neighbours can be a local minimum .",
    "thus there is a nearest neighbour exclusion principle for the minima .",
    "this constraint indicates that one can not pack arbitrarily large number of minima on the lattice and there is an upper bound on the number of minima .",
    "for example , on a bipartite lattice , one can pack at most @xmath59 local minima , one at every alternate site .",
    "in particular , on a square lattice the minima will be placed on a checkerboard pattern .",
    "thus , in this case , the large deviation function @xmath57 is defined for @xmath60 . on the other hand , on a cayley tree with @xmath61 number of branches and @xmath3 sites",
    ", we will see later that @xmath62 , thus @xmath63 .",

    "however , far from the mean , @xmath12 will have non - gaussian tails , indicating a departure of @xmath57 from the simple quadratic form .",
    "a knowledge of the function @xmath57 would then allow one to compute the probabilities of occurrences of atypical configurations , such as the probability of a configuration with the lowest number of minima ( e.g. @xmath68 ) or the ones with the maximal number of minima ( @xmath69 .",
    "a particular focus of this paper will be to compute the probability of a maximally packed configuration , i.e. , when @xmath70 .",

    "of course , this expression also gives the scaling of the fraction of permutations which have @xmath73 local minima in the permutation landscape .",
    "it is then natural to interpret @xmath74 as the entropy cost per site to achieve maximally packed minima .",

    "a cayley tree with an infinite number of branches corresponds to a hypercubic lattice in @xmath0-dimensions in the @xmath84 limit .",
    "thus , based on these two limiting results , one expects the constant @xmath75 on any @xmath0-dimensional lattice to satisfy the bounds @xmath85 our numerical simulations for @xmath86 are consistent with these bounds .",

    "<S> then we derive the closed form expression for the large deviation function in the case of the one dimensional lattice in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : onedimension ] . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of the rest of the paper is the maximum packing problem . in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : maxpack ] we determine the probability of maximum packings for several solvable cases , namely cayley trees and a two - leg ladder . </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattices is then treated by numerical computation in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : numerics ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , these different results are discussed in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : conclusions ] and some closing remarks are given . </S>"
