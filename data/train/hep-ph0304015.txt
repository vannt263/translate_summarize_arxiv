    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is widely regarded as capable of directly observing the agent responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation .",
    "this is generally believed to be a light higgs boson with mass @xmath8  gev  @xcite .",
    "the lhc will easily find a light standard model ( sm ) higgs boson with very moderate luminosity  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lhc will have significant capability to determine many of its properties  @xcite , such as its decay modes and couplings  @xcite , including invisible decays@xcite and possibly even rare decays to light fermions  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath6 linear collider with a center of mass energy of 350  gev or more can significantly improve these preliminary measurements , in some cases by an order of magnitude in precision , if an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath9 can be achieved  @xcite .    starting from the requirement that the higgs boson has to restore unitarity of weak boson scattering at high energies in the sm  @xcite , perhaps the most important measurement after the higgs boson discovery is of the higgs potential itself , which requires measurement of the trilinear and quartic higgs boson self - couplings , @xmath2 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these can be probed directly only by multiple higgs boson production ( at any future collider ) .",
    "while @xmath2 can be measured in higgs boson pair production , triple higgs boson production is needed to probe @xmath10 . since the cross sections for three higgs boson production processes are more than a factor @xmath11 smaller than those for higgs pair production at linear colliders  @xcite , and about an order of magnitude smaller at hadron colliders  @xcite , the quartic higgs boson coupling will likely remain elusive even at the highest collider energies and luminosities considered so far .    several studies of higgs boson pair production in @xmath6 collisions have been conducted over the past few years  @xcite , deriving quantitative sensitivity limits for the trilinear higgs self - coupling @xmath2 for several proposed linear colliders with center of mass energies spanning the range from 500  gev to 3  tev . for example , a study employing neural net techniques found that @xmath2 could be measured for @xmath12  gev with a precision of about @xmath13 at a 500  gev linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath9  @xcite . in contrast , the potential of the lhc , a luminosity - upgraded lhc ( slhc ) which would gather 10  times the amount of data expected in the first run , and a very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) , has been examined only recently  @xcite .",
    "these studies investigated higgs pair production via gluon fusion and subsequent decay to same - sign dileptons and three leptons via @xmath14 bosons .",
    "they established that future hadron machines can probe the higgs potential for @xmath15  gev . at the lhc , with an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath9 , a vanishing of @xmath2 can be excluded at the @xmath16 confidence level or better over the entire range @xmath17  gev . at a vlhc , the higgs boson self - coupling can be determined with a precision of a few percent with the same integrated luminosity for @xmath18  gev , which is similar or better than the limits achievable at a 3  tev @xmath6 collider with 5  ab@xmath9  @xcite .",

    "larger deviations are possible in scenarios beyond the sm . for example , in two higgs doublet models where the lightest higgs boson is forced to have sm like couplings to vector bosons , quantum corrections may increase the trilinear higgs boson coupling by up to @xmath37  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "loop corrections modify the self - coupling of the lightest higgs boson , which has sm - like couplings , by up to @xmath38 for light stop squarks  @xcite .",

    "the anomalous higgs boson self - couplings can be parameterized in terms of higher dimensional operators which are induced by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "a systematic analysis of higgs boson self - couplings in a higher dimensional operator approach can be found in ref .",
    "at lhc energies , inclusive higgs boson pair production is dominated by gluon fusion .",
    "other processes , such as weak boson fusion , @xmath39  @xcite , associated production with heavy gauge bosons , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 )  @xcite , or associated production with top quark pairs , @xmath42  @xcite , yield cross sections which are factors of 10   30 smaller than that for @xmath43  @xcite .",

    "we examine the largest overall branching ratio production , which yields four @xmath22-quark final states , and decays where one higgs boson decays into @xmath46 and the other into a @xmath47 pair , @xmath48 .    for all our calculations we assume an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath9 for lhc and vlhc  @xcite , and 3000  fb@xmath9@xcite for the slhc .",
    "we choose @xmath49  @xcite , and assume a @xmath22-tagging efficiency of @xmath50 for all hadron colliders .",
    "signal and background cross sections are consistently calculated using cteq4l  @xcite parton distribution functions .",
    "we include minimal detector effects by gaussian smearing of the parton momenta according to atlas expectations  @xcite , and take into account energy loss in the @xmath22-jets via a parameterized function .",
    "in addition , we include an efficiency of @xmath51 for capturing each @xmath45 or @xmath52 decay in the signal in its relevant mass bin .",
    "all tree level processes are calculated using madgraph  @xcite and retain a finite @xmath22-quark mass of 4.6  gev .",
    "we perform the calculation of the signal , @xmath54 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the effects of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections via a multiplicative factor @xmath55 at lhc and @xmath56 at vlhc energies  @xcite . the largest background to consider is qcd continuum four @xmath22-quark production .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scale choices are taken to be @xmath57 .",
    "there is large uncertainty due to scale variation in the qcd backgrounds , but this is irrelevant given our findings which follow . the choice of scales for the signal rate can have a large impact as well , for example varying the scale between the higgs boson mass and the invariant mass of the final state higgs boson pair , as chosen as a default in the public version of the nlo matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "however , after including the approximate nlo corrections as a @xmath58-factor we find that the scale dependence of the cross section as a measure of the theoretical uncertainty is strongly reduced , which is the main reason to compute and include these higher order corrections .",
    "we require that all four @xmath22-quarks in the event are tagged .",
    "the kinematic acceptance cuts for events at the lhc are : @xmath59 which are motivated first by requirements that these all - hadronic events can pass the atlas and cms triggers with reasonable efficiency  @xcite , and that two @xmath22-quark pairs each reconstruct to a window around the known higgs boson mass , asymmetric due to energy loss in the @xmath22-jets .",
    "this invariant mass constraint on the six possible bottom pairs defines the candidates to reconstruct the higgs bosons .",
    "we also use the cuts of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cuts1 ] ) for the slhc and vlhc .",
    "preliminary studies concluded  @xcite that cuts similar to those listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cuts1 ] ) should be sufficient , although increased background from event pile - up is expected to degrade detector performance at the slhc .",
    "comparing the signal and the backgrounds , there is first of all an important difference between the @xmath60 final state and the @xmath61 final state investigated previously  @xcite : the background of the bottom final state does not involve any massive particles , like top quarks or @xmath14 bosons .",
    "all four bottom jets in the qcd background process are either produced without a strong azimuthal correlation between each other or come from ( mostly collinear ) gluon splitting .",
    "the latter will to a large degree be removed by the @xmath62 cut together with the @xmath63 cut .",
    "this on the one hand requires a hard central gluon to split into two bottom quarks , which on the other hand can not be boosted together . even though the higgs bosons are produced close to rest , they are still very massive states with a non - negligible transverse momentum , which decay to effectively massless bottom quarks .",
    "translated into the geometry of the four bottom jets , this means that we can require a sizable transverse momentum of the bottom pairs which should reconstruct the higgs bosons , and also require that these bottom jets lie close to each other in the azimuthal plane : @xmath64 as in the @xmath61 signal case  @xcite , we will later try to determine the higgs boson self - coupling from the shape of the invariant mass of the final state .",
    "for that reason we do not apply any cuts which make use of the fact that the signal involves two heavy massive particles produced in a fairly narrow range of the @xmath60 invariant mass .",
    "however , for a fixed invariant mass of the @xmath60 final state we expect more forward jets for the qcd background which in turn do not need to have as large a transverse momentum .",
    "we therefore require the scalar sum of the transverse momentum to obey : @xmath65 extracting the higgs boson self - coupling follows the same path as for the @xmath61 final state  @xcite . to discriminate signal and background",
    ", we can use the visible invariant mass , @xmath66 , which for the @xmath60 final state is the invariant mass of the higgs boson pair , corrected for energy loss of the @xmath22 jets .",
    "the @xmath66 distributions of the signal for @xmath12  gev and the qcd background at the lhc are shown in fig .",

    "the dotted and dot - dashed lines show the signal cross section for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively.,width=502 ]    even after all cuts , the qcd background is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the signal . for an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath9 , about 55  signal events are expected in the sm .",
    "the absence of a higgs boson self - coupling ( @xmath68 ) results in a higgs boson pair production cross section about a factor  1.6 larger than the sm result , whereas increasing @xmath2 to twice the sm value decreases the rate by a factor  1.7 . at vlhc energies ,",
    "the cross sections of the signal and background are a factor 100 and 60 larger than those at the lhc , giving negligible improvement in the signal to background ratio , @xmath70 .",
    "the small signal cross section combined with the huge qcd @xmath60 background make it essentially impossible to determine the higgs boson self - coupling in @xmath71 .",
    "we quantify this statement by performing a @xmath72 test on the @xmath66 distribution , similar to that described in ref .",
    "except for the higgs boson self - coupling , we assume the sm to be valid . to approximately take into account the unknown nlo qcd corrections to @xmath71",
    ", we multiply the qcd @xmath60 differential cross section by a uniform @xmath58-factor of @xmath73 and allow for a normalization uncertainty of @xmath74 for the sm cross section . for @xmath12",
    "gev we then obtain @xmath75 bounds of @xmath76 where @xmath77    for comparison , a 500  gev linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath9 could determine @xmath2 with a precision of about @xmath13 for @xmath12  gev  @xcite . for @xmath21  gev , the @xmath45 branching ratio drops quickly .",
    "since the background cross section decreases only slightly , @xmath70 , and thus the bounds on the @xmath2 , worsen with increasing values of @xmath57 .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath60 production to the higgs boson self - coupling is largely due to the overwhelming qcd background .",
    "a more advantageous @xmath70 is conceivable if one of the higgs bosons in @xmath43 decays into a @xmath47 pair . in this case , the main contributions to the background arise from continuum @xmath79 and @xmath80 production .",
    "we calculate both processes using tree level matrix elements which include all decay correlations .",
    "top quarks are generated on - shell .",
    "the calculation of the signal proceeds as for the @xmath60 final state .",

    "@xcite .",
    "if both @xmath47 leptons decay leptonically , @xmath60 production where two @xmath22-quarks decay leptonically represents an additional potentially large background , even if one requires that both leptons are isolated .",
    "in addition , the signal cross section is suppressed by the small branching ratio of about @xmath81 if both @xmath47 leptons decay leptonically . in the following we therefore only consider decays where at least one @xmath47 lepton decays hadronically .    to identify @xmath23 events in a hadron collider environment",

    "if both @xmath47 leptons decay hadronically , even more severe @xmath89 cuts are required  @xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the @xmath47 decay jets .    for the signal ,",
    "the @xmath47-pair invariant mass can be reconstructed from the observable @xmath47 decay products and the missing transverse momentum vector of the event  @xcite . to reduce the background ,",

    "@xmath93 ranges from about 7.5  gev for @xmath12  gev to 15  gev for @xmath95  gev .",
    "finally , we impose the following cuts on the @xmath22-jets : @xmath96 unlike for the @xmath60 final state , we have chosen a symmetric window around @xmath57 for the @xmath46 invariant mass .",
    "we found that although the energy loss in the @xmath22-quarks creates a non - gaussian tail for @xmath97 , it makes little difference whether a symmetric or asymmetric @xmath62 cut is imposed for @xmath23 production .",
    "since there are more @xmath46 combinations possible , the difference between a symmetric and asymmetric window for @xmath62 is more pronounced for @xmath60 production .",
    "we also use the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cuts10 ] ) and ( [ eq : cuts11 ] ) for the slhc and vlhc .",
    "we note that since the @xmath89 distributions of the @xmath47 decay products fall steeply with increasing transverse momenta , the @xmath98 cross section depends sensitively on the cuts in eqs .",

    "the effects of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections are included in our calculation via multiplicative factors which are summarized in table  [ tab : one ] .",
    "note that this is one of the rare instances where the nlo corrections are known for the signal and all major backgrounds .",
