    "wmap _ provides an integral constraint on reionization , indicating that reionization began before @xmath5 @xcite . at face value",
    ", the evidence suggests that reionization was a long and complicated process ; it is a topic of intense current research .",
    "since neutral hydrogen radiates in the rest frame at a wavelength of 21 cm due to the `` spin - flip '' hyperfine transition , 21 cm tomography has been suggested as a very promising probe of the history of reionization .",
    "this radiation should be observable at earth at low radio frequencies after being cosmologically redshifted .",
    "this 21 cm radiation from the reionization epoch should carry immensely rich information about the reionization process and the formation of structure .",
    "furthermore , since by scanning through frequency one effectively is scanning through different redshifts of 21 cm emission , one has the remarkable ability to probe the evolution of the neutral hydrogen density with time .",
    "early work studying the potential of 21 cm observations to probe the high - redshift universe was done by , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent research has focused on the expected statistical signal of the 21 cm intensity from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) @xcite .",
    "it was proposed by @xcite that one may study the angular power spectra of brightness temperature fluctuations at different frequencies ( and cosmic epochs ) in order to probe the details of the reionization history .",
    "an alternative approach emphasizes the full three - dimensional nature of the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "angular observations of the 21 cm sky stepped through different frequencies can be combined to form an image cube by mapping frequency to line - of - sight distance , and such three - dimensional image cubes can be used to probe the statistical properties of the full three - dimensional distribution of hi fluctuations at a particular epoch during reionization .",
    "the simple three - dimensional structure of the intrinsic fluctuations can be harnessed to remove foregrounds with distinct symmetry properties .",

    "the expected statistical signal detected by future 21 cm observations will be of a complicated nature , resulting from a combination of cosmological sources and astrophysical processes .",
    "the intrinsic 21 cm signal is determined by fluctuations in density , neutral fraction , and the spin temperature describing the relative populations of hi spin states , which is affected by the background radiation field . @xcite and @xcite have shown how inhomogenous reionization will imprint a shoulder feature on the power spectra ; hence the power spectra can be an effective discriminant between possible reionization scenarios .",
    "@xcite have pointed out the importance of the effect of peculiar velocities , which introduce redshift space distortions and are caused by the infall towards ( or outflow from ) density perturbations . @xcite",

    "these anisotropies may be exploited to separate out the effects of the density fluctuations and astrophysical processes .",
    "the effects of radiative processes through the spin temperature have recently been considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these sources of fluctuations together determine the intrinsic power spectrum , and hence the autocorrelation function , at any given epoch ( or redshift ) . as the 21 cm photons emitted by hi stream through the universe , their paths are perturbed stochastically by density inhomogeneities , and their observed directions in the sky are altered .",
    "hence , gravitational lensing by large scale structure presents another source of fluctuations and modifies the intrinsic power spectra and correlation functions .",
    "these weak lensing modifications are best thought of as secondary fluctuations ; they are determined by density fluctuations along the photon path between emission and observation . furthermore , they act upon existing fluctuations : without intrinsic brightness fluctuations characterized by the physics of the eor , lensing would have no effect .    the effect of weak gravitational lensing on diffuse backgrounds has been studied extensively in the context of the cmb .",
    "the effects on the temperature and polarization power spectra have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "future observations of 21 cm backgrounds will present a new source of diffuse emission that will be subject to weak lensing by large scale structure .",
    "in contrast to the cmb , which presents a single , narrow surface at one redshift , the 21 cm emission from different redshifts provides multiple source planes that may be observed in order to study lensing effects . indeed , the three - dimensional nature of 21 cm tomography provides a new and interesting context for lensing sudies .",

    "the 21 centimeter background from the eor presents a distinct case in which to study the weak lensing effect .",
    "the two cases differ significantly in the distribution of fluctuation power on small scales versus large scales . in the case of the cmb",
    ", the intrinsic power is dominated by the acoustic peaks on scales of order @xmath8 , while small scale power @xmath9 is suppressed due to silk damping .",
    "the contributions to the temperatures fluctuations are confined to angular scales larger than arcseconds . in the case of the 21 cm background fluctuations from eor ,",
    "the power spectrum is dominated by small scale power on scales @xmath9 . in order to fully understand the effects of weak lensing by large scale structure , one must consider many more decades of scale , and much smaller scales , than in the case of the cmb .",
    "this simple observation has implications for how one calculates lensing effects on the 21 cm background .",
    "existing methods for calculating the lens effects on power spectra of diffuse backgrounds are similar in that they are perturbative in the deflection angle field , which maps the source plane into the observed image plane . for example , in the method of hu ( 2000 ) , and as extended to higher order in cooray ( 2004 ) , the lensed temperature field is expanded in the deflection angle as a taylor series . @xmath10 the deflection angles are coupled to higher and higher derivatives of the temperature field . in cases where there is dominant small scale power , and thus significant fluctuations with wavelengths smaller than the typical deflection angle on arcminute scales , one expects that expansions of the temperature field in which only a few terms are retained are insufficient to describe the lensing effect . a low - order perturbative expansion of the unlensed temperature in the deflection angle is an inaccurate approximation of the lensed temperature field if the temperature is not sufficiently smooth on scales smaller than and of order the typical deflection angle . in order to characterize the lensing effect ,",
    "it is apparent that one must carefully take into account higher order terms in these methods .",
    "there is a caveat in this reasoning . since ultimately we wish to understand the lensing effect on the power spectrum , the lensing effect comes through only the two - point function of the product of the temperature at one observed point and another point",
    "one can show that the calculation depends only on the difference between the deflection angles at the two points , rather than the individual magnitudes of each deflection angle .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that an overall , coherent deflection of the temperature pattern on the sky will not change the pattern .",
    "hence the relevant physical quantity is the variation of the deflection field over the scale of temperature fluctuations .",
    "a series solution for the lensed power spectrum is obtained by forming the lensing correlation function @xmath11 , and performing the transform analytically .",
    "the result is @xmath12 ^ 2 \\dotsm   \\left [ \\bm{k_n } \\cdot ( \\bm{l } - \\bm{k_1 } - \\ldots - \\bm{k_n } ) \\right]^2 \\\\   & \\times c^{\\phi}_{k_1 } \\ldots c^{\\phi}_{k_n } c^t _ { | \\bm{l } - \\bm{k_1 } - \\ldots - \\bm{k_n } | } e^ { -| \\bm{l } - \\bm{k_1 } - \\ldots - \\bm{k_n } |^2 r } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 @xcite . in order to compute the result to the @xmath14th order in @xmath15 , one must expand the exponentials and retain all integrals with up to @xmath14 factors of the lensing potential power spectrum , @xmath16 .    in the harmonic space expansions of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", this dependence on only the relative deflection angle manifests itself in cancellations between positive and negative integrals at a given order in the lensing potential power spectrum .",
    "when there is significant small scale power , the individual terms at a given order can become very large , but the total contribution of these terms may be very small due to these cancellations between positive and negative terms . a correct computation of higher order contributions to the lensed power spectrum must carefully account for delicate cancellations between such terms .",
    "hence , the presence of significant small - scale power alone does not guarantee that appropriately summed higher - order corrections will be important .",
    "the degree to which such cancellations occur generally depends on the shape of the intrinsic power spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , one must check these high order contributions in order to determine whether or not the lensing calculation has converged properly on small angular scales .    in the harmonic space expansion",
    ", however , the calculation of higher order terms becomes numerically difficult .",
    "whereas the leading order lensing contribution ( at order @xmath17 ) is a simple integral over the two - dimensional space of the lensing potential wavevector , the second order correction requires the evaluation of a four - dimensional integral . in general",
    ", the computation of the @xmath18 corrections requires the evaluation of a @xmath19-dimensional numerical integral over the unlensed temperature spectrum and @xmath14 lensing potential power spectra . in order to compute the lensing effects on the 21 cm spectrum ,",
    "in which there is significant small scale power in several decades , these integrations must be done over many decades of scale . at each order",
    ", one must correctly handle the delicate cancellations between these multi - dimensional integrals over decades in scale .",
    "this procedure for accounting for higher - order effects becomes numerically exhaustive and slow , and may lead to inaccurate estimates .",
    "the other approach used in calculating the lensed cmb power spectrum is described in @xcite and @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the two - point autocorrelation function of the lensed temperature field is computed numerically , and the transform of this result is computed to calculate the power spectrum .",
    "this is also essentially an expansion in the full deflection angle coupled to derivatives of the temperature field .",
    "indeed , one can show that these two approaches are equivalent when one does not terminate either series or expands each to the same order in the deflection dispersion . a downside to this method is the need to transform back and forth between position and fourier space .",
    "this involves numerical integrations with bessel functions which become highly oscillatory at small scales .",
    "furthermore , the transforms obscure the effects of the lensing power spectrum on modifying the temperature power spectrum . a purely harmonic calculation has the appeal of transparency , as all relevant quantities interact in the fourier domain .",
    "the difficulties apparent in these existing methods motivate us to develop a new method to handle the lensing calculation in the case of the 21 cm background . in this section",
    "we present a new method using a differential equation approach .",
    "this method avoids the pitfalls of the above methods .",
    "first , the differential approach allows a straightforward computation of higher order corrections without requiring evaluation of irreducible high - dimensional integrals .",
    "the differential approach allows us at once to sum up many terms from all orders in the series .",
    "cancellations between terms , corresponding to differences in deflections , are carefully done shell by shell in fourier space as a function of a single wavenumber cutoff @xmath20 .",
    "extensions of the calculation to include finer approximations are straightforward to derive .",
    "the systems of differential equations are solved entirely in harmonic space , avoiding highly oscillatory bessel transforms back and forth between position and harmonic spaces .",
    "furthermore , the harmonic space solution allows for illuminating analytic simplifications in certain limits .",
    "our new approach is easy to implement , requiring only one - dimensional integration and a differential equation solver .",
    "our analysis will be carried out in the formalism of the flat - sky approximation , which is sufficient on small angular scales and small sections of the sky .",
    "since we will apply this method to the 21 cm emission , where most of the power is at small scales , this approximation should be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we expect that corrections due to the curvature of the sky will be small in the regime studied in this work . in general , for high - precision and low multipoles",
    ", one should take into account curvature effects ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in the flat sky limit , an observeable @xmath21 on the sky can be expanded in fourier modes rather than spherical harmonics , e.g. @xmath22 with power spectra @xmath23    the lensing modes are usually approximated as gaussian random variables .",
    "the fluctuations of lens quantities , e.g. the projected potential , deflection angle and effective convergence , are described by the power spectra , which are integrals over the matter fluctuations along the line of sight .",

    "our strategy differs fundamentally from previous approaches . instead of finding a solution perturbative in the full deflection angle , we expand in a differential shell of modes of the deflection field .",
    "this leads us to a differential equation solution for the lensing effect in fourier space .",
    "we show how this strategy leads to a hierarchy of systems of differential equations .",

    "we have simply introduced this cutoff explicitly , and use it as a tool to regulate the calculation of the lensed quantities .",
    "we will show how the lensing problem reduces to a system of differential equations in the cutoff , and this system will be evolved to a high enough @xmath20 so that the calculation in the regime of interest has converged and thus is independent of higher frequency spatial modes of the lens .    the lensed temperature correlation function , lensed by deflection modes @xmath54 is formed as : @xmath55 \\rangle \\\\ & = \\langle \\tilde{t}_\\lambda \\tilde{t}_\\lambda ' \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial { \\beta_\\lambda^i } } t(\\bm{\\beta}_\\lambda )   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial { \\beta_\\lambda^a } ' } t(\\bm{\\beta}_{\\lambda } ' ) \\rangle \\langle \\delta d^a \\delta d^i   \\rangle \\end{split}\\ ] ] where primed and unprimed quantities correspond to the coordinates @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , and @xmath58 is the displacement vector .",
    "gradients of the temperature field with respect to the source position @xmath59 are denoted by subscripts , e.g. @xmath60 .",
    "we have expanded to second - order in the relative differential deflection angle @xmath61 and used the translational invariance property of the average .",
    "the einstein summation convention for repeated indices is implied in each term , and @xmath62 .",
    "here we have expressed the temperature lensed by lensing modes @xmath63 in relation to the lensed temperature just including lensing modes @xmath47 , both at the observed position , @xmath56 . in the last two terms , the first ensemble averages are over the temperature and lensing modes up to @xmath47 , and the second averages are over the lensing modes in the fourier shell @xmath64 , and we have assumed the lensing mode amplitudes are distributed as gaussian random variables .",
    "this arrangement of terms emphasizes that the lensing effect depends only on differences between deflection angles at different points , not on their absolute values .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that the correlation functions only depend upon differences in position .",
    "since we will divide through by @xmath65 and take its limit to zero , the neglected terms in the taylor expansion involving higher order products of the relative deflection will vanish ; hence , this expansion becomes exact .    in order to evaluate the derivatives on the source plane with respect",

    "physically , this corresponds to a picture in which the deflection field is coherent over the scale of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "temperature fluctuations on small scales are gravitationally deflected together , resulting in an overall shift that does not change the fluctuation power on those scales . in this limiting case",
    ", the vanishing of the leading term is independent of the power in the lensing mode .",
    "thus , even though the rms amplitude of the incremental deflection angle may be large compared to the fluctuation with wavenumber @xmath112 , in this particular limit the leading lensing effect vanishes . the remaining fractional lensing effect is proportional to @xmath113 , which is the power per logarithmic interval in the convergence .",

    "this intuition demonstrates that low @xmath20 lensing modes are relatively unimportant , unless @xmath115 .",
    "the lensing behavior then will generally depend on the power of lensing fluctuations at that scale and the shape of the temperature spectrum .",

    "we see that , whereas the convergence power is increasing on large scales @xmath126 , it is fairly flat or decreasing on small scales @xmath127 .",

    "it is useful to discuss how this new formulation of the weak lensing calculation differs from previous approaches .",
    "the standard approaches ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) estimate the lensed temperature at a given observed point by expanding the unlensed temperature in a taylor polynomial in the deflection angle ( e.g. eq .",
    "1 ) , keeping only a few terms .",
    "the accuracy of this expansion will depend on the smoothness of the underlying source temperature field , which depends upon how the fluctuation power is distributed over scales in the intrinsic temperature power spectrum .",
    "the key point is that the unlensed intensity is determined from the lensed image position in a one - step extrapolation depending upon the temperature derivatives evaluated at a single point , i.e. @xmath250 .",
    "the main difference in this new method is that the source position is determined in multiple steps , as a function of the cutoff @xmath20 .",
    "when one integrates over a new shell of the lensing modes with wavenumbers between @xmath20 and @xmath77 , the source position @xmath175 changes incrementally through the lens equation .",
    "the first position - space equation for the temperature correlation function tells us to evaluate the source temperature derivatives at the new source position @xmath59 in order to determine the incremental modifications to the lensed correlation function .",
    "hence , by integrating over the lensing spectrum mode by mode , one is continuously updating the current source positions and the current local source gradients , which determine the lensing modifications .",
    "this is analogous to numerical methods for extrapolating a function @xmath251 to get to @xmath252 from @xmath253 .",
    "the simplest thing to do is evaluate the derivatives at the initial point @xmath254 and extrapolate to get @xmath252 with a taylor polynomial in one - step .",
    "the accuracy will depend on the order of the polynomial one uses and how far away @xmath254 is from @xmath255 relative to the scale over which @xmath251 is varying .",
    "more sophisticated methods would use multiple smaller steps in which the derivatives of @xmath251 are evaluated along the trajectory between the points @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "previous methods are analogous to the one - step taylor expansion calculation .",
    "our new differential approach is analogous to the latter , adaptive approach , in that the lensing modifications are calculated along the trajectory on the source plane between the observed position @xmath256 and the final source temperature position @xmath257 .    the first equation , eq . , which determines the lensed temperature correlation function as a function of the cutoff , is exact in the limit of the flat - sky and in the limit that we take the lensing shell increment @xmath78",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that we did not expand in the full deflection angle , but only in the differential increment of the deflection field containing the new modes .",
    "however , in order to evaluate the right hand side of the differential equation , one must evaluate the first derivative correlator at the new source positions .",
    "the implication is that we have to evaluate the second derivatives at the changing source position @xmath258 .",
    "then to update the changing second derivative correlator we have to calculate third derivative correlators , and so on . this leads to the hierarchy of equations for the temperature correlator and temperature derivative correlators .",
    "we can terminate and close the hierarchy at any level by approximating a derivative on the source plane with a derivative on the observed image plane , at the cost of neglecting terms representing the relative distortion of these derivatives through the dimensionless convergence and shear , which are presumed to be small @xmath259 in the limit of weak lensing .",
    "this brings us to a second major distinction of this method .",
    "whereas the previous methods are essentially perturbative in the full deflection angle , so that the truncation errors are simply those attributed to high - order terms in the deflection angle , in this new formulation the approximation is based upon the smallness of elements of the distortion tensor , which are derivatives of the deflection angle , in weak lensing . intuitively , the key point we emphasize here is that the rms magnitude of the deflection at a single point is not the physically relevant quantity in determining the lensing modification to the two - point function or the power spectrum .",
    "what is physically important is the difference between the deflection angles at two points , which is determined by the dimensionless second derivatives of the projected potential through the convergence and shear .",
    "hence , in the context of the weak lensing calculation , it is more appropriate to approximate about the dimensionless elements of the distortion tensor rather than the deflection angle .",
    "furthermore , this approximation depends primarily on the weakness of the distortion tensor elements rather than the properties of the temperature fluctuations being lensed .",
    "the numerical implementation of these systems of equations is simple . in order to implement the second order approximation , for example , to compute the lensing effect on a power spectrum sampled at @xmath14 points ,",
    "one simply creates a vector of @xmath260 elements .",
    "this is initialized to the values of the unlensed temperature spectrum , @xmath41 for the first @xmath14 values , the initial values of @xmath218 ( which are @xmath41 ) for the next @xmath14 , and then the initial values of @xmath219 , which are zero for the final @xmath14 slots .",
    "this vector is then fed into an adaptive runge - kutta 4th and 5th order algorithm , and an adaptive gauss - kronrod scheme is used to evaluate the one - dimensional integrals on the right hand sides of the equations with the help of smooth interpolations between the sample points .",
    "since the intrinsic power spectra are very smooth , these integrations are simple .",
    "we apply our first and second order sets of lensing differential equations to the case of 21 cm fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations in the 21 cm emission at redshift @xmath261 as seen against the cmb are described by : @xmath262^{1/2 } \\\\ & \\times \\left(\\frac{t_s - t_{cmb}}{t_s}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\omega_b h^2}{0.02}\\right ) x_h ( 1 + \\delta ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the simplification that the spin temperature @xmath263 is coupled to the kinetic temperature @xmath264 of the gas that is heated far above the cmb temperature , @xmath265 , the fluctuations are independent of the spin temperature .",
    "then the intensity fluctuations are due to the fluctuations in the quantity @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the neutral hydrogen fraction , and @xmath268 the matter density contrast .",
    "we have ignored additional sources of fluctuations , e.g. peculiar velocities , for simplicity .",
    "we have taken semi - analytic models of the expected 21 cm fluctuation power spectra at several redshifts .",
    "these correspond to a sample model of a single reionization history as described in @xcite .",
    "this model is described by an ionization efficiency factor @xmath269 , and we use the resulting temperature power spectra at redshifts of @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath38 , and @xmath272 , corresponding to mean neutral fractions @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and @xmath276 .",

    "<S> we describe the effects of weak gravitational lensing by cosmological large scale structure on the diffuse emission of 21 centimeter radiation from neutral hydrogen at high redshifts during the era of reionization . the ability to observe radial information through the frequency , and thus three - dimensional regions of the background radiation at different redshifts , suggests that 21 cm studies may provide a useful context for studying weak lensing effects . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the gravitational lensing effects on both the angular power spectra and the intrinsic , three - dimensional power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new approach for calculating the weak lensing signature based on integrating differential fourier - space shells of the deflection field and approximating the magnification matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the problem of calculating the effect and higher order corrections to solving coupled systems of differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> this method is applied to reionization models of the 21 cm background spectra up to small angular scales over a range in redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the effect on the angular power spectrum is typically less than one percent on small angular scales , and very small on scales corresponding to the feature imprinted by reionization bubbles , due to the near - scale invariance of the angular power spectrum of the 21 cm signal on these scales . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the expected effect of weak lensing on three - dimensional 21 cm power spectra , and show that lensing creates aspherical perturbations to the intrinsic power spectrum which depend on the polar angle of the wavevector . </S>",
    "<S> the effect on the three - dimensional power spectrum is less than a percent on scales @xmath0 , but can be @xmath1 for highly inclined modes for @xmath2 . the angular variation of the lensing effect on these scales is well described by a quartic polynomial in the cosine of the polar angle . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of the gravitational lensing effects on 21 cm power spectra will require very sensitive , high resolution observations by future low - frequency radio arrays . </S>"
