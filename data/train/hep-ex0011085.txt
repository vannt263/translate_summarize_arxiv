    "two photon interactions are characterised by a cross section that is several orders of magnitude larger compared to those typical for boson and fermion production in @xmath2 collisions . at a @xmath2 linear collider",
    ", a high rate of @xmath4 collisions arises from photons radiated in the electro - magnetic interactions of the colliding beams . while interesting for themselves , products of @xmath4 interactions may overlap with those from a @xmath2 interaction creating a source of potential confusion for the event reconstruction .    due to the large luminosity per bunch crossing @xmath6  nb@xmath7  bx@xmath7 achieved at tesla ,",
    "the rate of @xmath8 hadrons overlap to a @xmath9 collision is 0.09 - 0.13 @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of bunches integrated within a read - out cycle of the relevant detector systems .",
    "the considerably high rate of this event overlap has been considered as a possible limiting factor in the precise study of processes whose production cross section is peaked in the forward region and experimental signature includes missing energy  @xcite . in this report , the identification of two photon interactions overlapped to @xmath5 higgs production via t - channel @xmath12 fusion is discussed .",
    "this channel offers a good benchmark process .",
    "an accurate determination of the higgs production cross - section by the @xmath12 fusion process is important for a determination of the higgs total width in conjunction with the @xmath13 decay branching fraction  @xcite .",
    "further , for a large interval of @xmath14 and @xmath3 values this process is the dominant higgs production mechanism in @xmath2 annihilations .",
    "the @xmath4 overlap may distort both the reconstruction efficiency and the jet flavour tagging performance .",
    "therefore it is of great importance to ensure that this @xmath4 background can be effectively rejected in the higgs studies .",
    "two photon events have been generated by the guinea  pig program  @xcite .",
    "beam parameters for 350  gev centre - of - mass were derived from the ones for 500  gev by keeping the beta - functions and emittances constant .",
    "the hadronic background has been modelled following schuler and sjstrand  @xcite using the most conservative proposed parametrisation of the cross section : @xmath15 the energies of two colliding photons have been stored in a file with their relevant probability .",
    "pythia  @xcite has then been used to generate the hadronic events .",
    "these events have been stored in a database from where they could be added to the main event stored in the pythia common block .",
    "the final state hadronic system has been appended to the event record of @xmath5 events generated using the pythia program .",
    "@xmath8  hadrons events are characterised by forward hadronic activity and by a production vertex contained in the colliding bunch envelope but distinct from that of the @xmath2 events . since at tesla",
    "the bunch size is 300  @xmath16 m in length but only few nm in the vertical and horizontal projections , @xmath8 hadrons events are effectively displaced only in the longitudinal direction ( see figure  [ fig : evt ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a @xmath17-tagging algorithm based on the impact parameter of the charged particles in each jets  @xcite has been applied and the pair of @xmath17-tagged jets giving the mass closest to the nominal higgs mass of 120  gev/@xmath18 have been selected .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the reconstructed recoil mass to the two selected jets and their invariant mass .",
    "a significant distortions towards higher mass values of the invariant mass distribution has been observed in presence of @xmath4 background .",
    "however after applying the anti-@xmath4 cut on @xmath19 and rescaling the resulting distribution by the estimated 20% reconstruction efficiency loss , the distributions agree well with those expected for pure @xmath20 decays .",
    "the effect of the overlap of @xmath0 to @xmath1 events has been studied for the case of the tesla @xmath2 linear collider at @xmath3 = 350  gev , assuming vertex tracker sensors able to resolve individual bunch crossing .",
    "the @xmath1 channel , characterised by missing energy and @xmath17-tagged jets is expected to be particularly sensitive to the effects of @xmath4 production .",
    "the @xmath4 background to physics events can be substantially reduced , with moderate loss in reconstruction efficiency , by a combination of kinematical and vertex topology observables .",
    "the remaining background , being confined to very forward hadron production , does not significantly interfere with the mass reconstruction and cross - section measurement for higgs studies in the @xmath12 fusion channel ."
