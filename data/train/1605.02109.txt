    "quantum - state tomography ( qst ) is a standard tool used to characterize , validate , and verify the performance of quantum information processors .",
    "unfortunately , qst is a demanding experimental task , partly because the number of free parameters of an arbitrary quantum state scale quadratically with the dimension of the system . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", one can study qst protocols which include prior information about the system and effectively reduce the number of free parameters in the model . in this work we study",
    "qst under the prior information that the state of the system is close to a pure state , and more generally , that it is close to a bounded - rank state ( a density matrix with rank less than or equal to a given value ) .",
    "indeed , in most quantum information processing applications the goal is not to manipulate arbitrary states , but to create and coherently evolve pure states . when the device is performing well , and there are only small errors , the quantum state produced will be close to a pure state , and the density matrix will have a dominant eigenvalue .",
    "one can use other techniques , e.g. randomized benchmarking  @xcite , to gain confidence that it is operating near this regime .",
    "this important prior information can be applied to significantly reduce the resources required for qst .",
    "we study different aspects of informational completeness that allow for efficient estimation in this scenario , and robust estimation in the face of noise or when the state is full rank , but still close to a bounded - rank state .",
    "bounded - rank qst has been studied by a number of previous workers @xcite , and has been shown to require less resources than general qst .",
    "one approach is based on the compressed sensing methodology  @xcite , where certain sets of randomly chosen measurements guarantee a robust estimation of low - rank states with high probability .",
    "other schemes  @xcite , not related to compressed sensing , construct specific measurements that accomplish bounded - rank qst , and some of these protocols have been implemented experimentally  @xcite . in addition , some general properties of such measurements have been derived  @xcite .    when considering bounded - rank qst a natural notion of informational completeness emerges  @xcite ,",
    "referred to as _",
    "rank-@xmath0 completeness_. a measurement ( a povm ) is rank-@xmath0 complete if the outcome probabilities uniquely distinguish a state with rank @xmath1 from any other state with rank @xmath1 .",
    "a rigorous definition is given below .",
    "the set of quantum states with rank @xmath1 , however , is not convex , and in general we can not construct efficient estimators based on rank-@xmath0 complete measurements that will yield a reliable state reconstruction in the presence of experimental noise .",
    "this poses a concern for the practicality of such measurements for qst .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is two fold : ( i ) we develop the significance of a different notion of informational completeness that we denote as _ rank-@xmath0 strict - completeness_. we prove that strictly - complete measurements allow for robust estimation of bounded - rank states in the realistic case of noise and experimental imperfections by solving essentially any convex program .",
    "because of this , strictly - complete measurements are crucial for the implementation of bounded - rank qst .",
    "( ii ) we study two different types of strictly - complete measurements and show that they require less resources than general qst .",
    "the first is a special type of measurement called `` element - probing '' povm ( ep - povm ) .",
    "for example , the measurements proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite are ep - povms . in this context , the problem of qst translates to the problem of density matrix completion , where the goal is to recover the entire density matrix when only a few of its elements are given .",
    "the formalism we develop here entirely captures the underlying structure of all ep - povms and solves the problem of bounded - rank density matrix completion .",
    "the second type of strictly - complete povm we study is the set of haar - random bases .",
    "based on numerical evidence we argue that measurement outcomes of a few random bases form a strictly - complete povm and that the number of bases required to achieve strict completeness scales weakly with the dimension and rank .    the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : info complete ] we establish the different definitions of informational completeness and in sec .  [ sec : power of strict ] we demonstrate the power of strictly - complete povms for practical tomography .",
    "we show how such povms allow us to employ convex optimization tools in quantum state estimators , and how the result is robust to experimental noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec : constructions ] we establish a complete theory of rank-@xmath0 complete and strictly - complete povms for the case of ep - povms and explore numerically how measurements in random orthogonal bases yield a strictly - complete povm .",

    "we can address this by convex optimization , whereby the estimate is found by minimizing a convex function over a convex set . since rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete povms uniquely identify a rank-@xmath0 quantum state from within the _ convex _ set of psd matrices , the data obtained from measurements defined by these povms fits the convex optimization paradigm . on the other hand ,",

    "in particular , in the context of qst with idealized noiseless data , the constraint @xmath60 would be redundant ; the reconstructed state would necessarily be properly normalized .",

    "this may be advantageous especially when considering estimation of high - dimensional quantum states .",

    "ep - povms are special types of povms where the measurement probabilities determine a subset of the total @xmath10 matrix elements , referred to as the `` measured elements .

    "for example , in the unary system with @xmath195 , using the measurement record from @xmath196 bases we can reconstruct all states with an infidelity below the threshold except for one .",
    "the results indicate that measuring only few random bases , with weak dependence on the dimension , corresponds to a strictly - complete povm for low - rank quantum states . moreover , the difference between , say rank-1 and rank-2 , amounts to measuring only a few more bases .",
    "this is important , as discussed below , in realistic scenarios when the state of the system is known to be close to pure . finally , when considering local measurements on qubits , more bases are required to account for strict - completeness when compared to unary system ; see for example results for @xmath197 .",
    "to demonstrate the robustness of the estimators , we simulate a realistic scenario where the state of the system is full rank but high purity and the experimental data contains statistical noise . from corollary",

    "secondly , we consider a collection of @xmath207 , and 5 qubits . in this case",
    "we simulate measurements both with a series of haar - random bases on each qubit and also with the rank-@xmath0 generalization of the measurement proposed by goyeneche  _ et al . _",

    "we have studied qst under the assumption that the state of the system is known to be close to a pure state , or more generally , to a rank @xmath1 state . since the set of rank @xmath1 states is nonconvex , it is generally difficult to robustly estimate the state of the system by measuring rank-@xmath0 complete povms .",
    "we showed , however , that a robust estimation is guaranteed if the measurements are rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete .",
    "such measurements efficiently identify a low - rank state from within the set of all quantum states .",
    "the essential ingredient of strict - completeness is the positivity constraint associated with physical density matrices .",
    "moreover , the estimation can be done by solving any convex program over the feasible set and the estimate returned is robust to errors .    generally , it is difficult to assess if an arbitrary povm satisfies one of these completeness relations . in this work we studied two different ways of designing strictly - complete measurements .",
    "the first was in the context of ep - povms , which allow for the algebraic reconstruction of a few density matrix elements .",
    "in this situation the problem of qst is reduced to density matrix completion .",
    "we developed tools to determine if a given ep - povm is rank-@xmath0 complete or rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete based on properties of the schur complement and matrix inertia .",
    "these tools provide a unified framework for all ep - povms and we used them to construct two rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete measurements .",
    "we also showed that a few random bases also form a strictly - complete measurement , with the number of bases required scaling weakly with the dimension .",
    "with either of these approaches one can iteratively probe highly - pure quantum states .",
    "a rank-@xmath132 strictly - complete povm could be used to produce an estimate of the dominant eigenvalue , as was shown by goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "one can then use our generalization for rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete povms to produce more accurate estimates , when needed .",
    "for example , a rank-@xmath217 strictly - complete povm , such as the ones introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : constructions ] , would produce an estimate corresponding to the state s two largest eigenvalues .",
    "one could continue to produce more accurate estimates but at some point the eigenvalues will be so small that other sources of noise will dominate . in future work",
    "we plan to explore how one can use such an iterative procedure to certify the number of dominant eigenvalues in the state without performing full quantum tomography .",

    "thus , this is an ep - povm which reconstruct the first @xmath0 rows and first @xmath0 columns of the density matrix .",

    "given that @xmath240 , using the rank additivity property of schur complement and that @xmath241 , we obtain @xmath242 . therefore , we conclude that @xmath169 .",
    "thus we can reconstruct the entire rank-@xmath0 density matrix .    following the arguments for the povm in eq .",
    ", it is straight forward to show that this povm is in fact rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete .",
    "the failure set of this povm corresponds to states for which @xmath104 is singular .",
    "the set is dense on a set of states of measure zero .",
    "the second rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete povm we construct corresponds to a measurement of @xmath248 orthonormal bases , which is a generalization of the four basis in eq .  .",
    "we consider the case that the dimension of the system is a power of two .",
    "since a measurement of @xmath249 mutually unbiased bases is fully informationally complete  @xcite , this construction is relevant as long as @xmath250 .",
    "we first assess the case of @xmath251 , which is the measurement proposed by goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite but without adaptation .",
    "in this case there are five bases , the first is the computational basis , @xmath252 , @xmath253 and the other four are given in eq .  .",

    ", we follow a similar strategy outlined in sec .",
    "[ ssec : ep ] .",
    "first , choose the leading @xmath257 principal submatrix , @xmath258 where , hereafter , the elements in bold font are the unmeasured elements . by applying a unitary transformation , which switches the first two rows and columns , we can move @xmath259 into the canonical form , @xmath260 from eq .",

    "we repeat the entire procedure again choosing a similar set of @xmath273 principal submatrices and reconstruct the 3rd diagonals and so on for the rest of the diagonals until all the unknown elements of the density matrix are reconstructed .",
    "since , we have reconstructed all diagonal elements of the density matrix and used the assumption that @xmath274 these five bases correspond to rank-@xmath132 complete povm . the first basis measures the 0th diagonal",
    "so by proposition  1 the measurement is rank-1 strictly - complete .",
    "the failure set corresponding to @xmath275 is when @xmath276 for @xmath277 .",

    "this set of submatrices results from also measuring the elements @xmath279 and @xmath280 , which were not used in the construction of @xmath275 .",
    "the failure set for @xmath278 is the same as the failure set of @xmath275 but since @xmath281 we gain additional robustness .",
    "when we consider both sets of submatrices the total failure set is @xmath276 and @xmath282 for @xmath277 and @xmath283 .",
    "this is the exact same set found by goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we generalize these ideas to measure a rank-@xmath0 state by designing @xmath284 orthonormal bases that correspond to a rank-@xmath0 strictly - complete povm .",
