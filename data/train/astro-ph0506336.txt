    "* for just a few examples ) .",
    "this analysis relies primarily on the comparison of a hydrogen balmer absorption - line strength to a metal absorption - line strength ( or a combination of metal lines ) to break the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy @xcite , as the balmer lines are ( non - linearly ) sensitive to the temperature of the main - sequence turnoff and the metal lines are sensitive to the temperature of the red giant branch .",
    "one can therefore determine accurate ages for the old stellar populations found in early - type galaxies .",
    "however , other hot star populations such as blue horizontal branch stars or blue straggler stars can significantly increase the observed balmer - line strengths of old stellar populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we explore the effect of a specific kind of hot star population , that is , old , metal - poor populations containing blue horizontal branch stars , on the inferred stellar population ages and compositions of early - type galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "these galaxies appear have significant intermediate - aged populations due to their enhanced balmer lines .",
    "we use blue indexes first described by @xcite to determine the level of contamination of the galaxy spectra by blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",
    "we then subtract model spectra representing populations containing these stars from the observed spectra and determine ages , metallicities , and enhancement ratios from the residual spectra .",
    "finally these stellar population parameters are compared with those determined from the observed spectra to quantify the effect of a contaminating population of old , metal - poor stars on the spectra of early - type galaxies .    throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to populations with metallicities @xmath4}}}\\leq-1.5 $ ] as ` metal - poor ' ( and thus possessing bhb stars ) and populations with ages @xmath5 gyr as ` intermediate aged ' .",
    "the line strengths discussed in this paper are derived from multi - slit spectra of twelve early - type galaxies in the coma cluster , centred on the cd galaxy ngc 4874 , taken with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck ii 10-m telescope .",
    "details relevant to the current study are summarised here ; for a complete description of the acquisition , reduction , and calibration of these spectra and the extraction of lick / ids absorption - line strengths we refer interested readers to trager , faber & dressler ( in preparation ; hereafter tfd05 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained in three consecutive 30-minute exposures on 7 april 1997 ut with the red side of lris , with seeing @xmath6 arcsec , through clouds .",
    "a slit width of 1 arcsec was used in conjunction with the 600 line @xmath7 grating blazed at 5000  , giving a resolution of 4.4   fwhm ( @xmath8  ) and a wavelength coverage of typically 35006000  , depending on slit placement .",
    "spectra of lick / ids standard g and k giant stars and f9g0 dwarfs @xcite were observed on the same and subsequent nights through the lris 1 arcsec long slit using the same grating to be used for calibration to the lick / ids system ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : lick ] below ) .",
    "individual two - dimensional spectra of each galaxy were extracted from the multi - slit images after standard calibrations ( overscan correction , bias removal , dark correction , and flat field correction ) , mapping of the geometric distortions , wavelength calibration , and sky subtraction were performed following the methodology of @xcite .",
    "both individual one - dimensional spectra and variance - weighted , combined spectra were then extracted from the two - dimensional spectra . in order to simulate an equivalent circular aperture to match with other line strength work in the coma cluster ,",
    "the extracted spectra were weighted by distance from the object centre . for the present study",
    "the spectra were extracted with an equivalent circular diameter aperture of 2.7 arcsec , matching the lick / ids galaxy aperture @xcite and the fibre diameter of the large sample of line strengths of coma galaxies of @xcite . finally , the spectra were flux - calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    ".observed line strengths of early - type galaxies in the coma cluster [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     m is the hot - star population given in table  [ tbl : models ] .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mean and rms scatter in fractional change in the age .",
    "after the appropriate fraction of hot - star light has been subtracted from the observed spectrum , lick / ids line strengths are recomputed ( including velocity dispersion , emission , and systemic corrections ) . the results are shown in figure  [ fig : hotstars ] as vectors pointing from the observed line strengths to the corrected line strengths . as is clear from this figure , the change in the line strengths point along vectors of _ nearly constant age _ with an increase in metallicity @xmath4}}}_{\\mathrm{ssp}}$ ] and a slight increase in @xmath11}}}_{\\mathrm{ssp}}$ ] being the major effects .",
    "this is borne out by the inferred stellar population parameters in table  [ tbl : tze ] and the fractional changes in table  [ tbl : changes ] : only ngc 4867 changes its age by more than @xmath12 . however , ngc 4867 is extrapolated far off of the w94 grids after subtraction in all three cases , and so the inferred ages and metallicities are suspect .",
    "we therefore find that _ the presence of even moderate amounts of light from hot stars does not significantly alter the inferred ages of early - type galaxies in the presence of intermediate - aged populations , _ provided that the hot - star light comes from an old , metal - poor population containing blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "we however do not claim that the ages of early - type galaxies are _ unaffected _ by hot stars .",
    "in fact , we reproduce in fig .  [",
    "fig : hotstars ] the result of @xcite that the _ oldest _ stellar populations ( @xmath1 gyr ) look younger by 25 gyr when ancient , metal - poor populations are superimposed on ancient , metal - rich populations .",
    "rather , we suggest that when an intermediate - aged population is present , i.e. , when @xmath13  , the influence of hot stars on the inferred age is nearly negligible ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the difference between the effect of hot - star light on intermediate - aged and old populations is mostly due to the change in slope of the w94 grids at old ages and high metallicities in the @xmath0@xmath14 $ ]  diagram and to the high @xmath0  strengths of the observed galaxies due , presumably , to intermediate - aged stellar populations .    the increased inferred metallicity but nearly constant age in the corrected population",
    "can be understood in the context of the appendix of @xcite , which demonstrated that stellar populations add as vectors in the @xmath0metal - line spaces ( such as @xmath0@xmath14 $ ] ) . in effect , the ` two ' populations in the coma early - type galaxies  the metal - rich , intermediate - aged population with high @xmath0  and high @xmath14 $ ] , and the metal - poor , old population with high @xmath0  ( from the hot blue horizontal branch stars ) and low @xmath14$]add to produce observed populations with high @xmath0  and moderate @xmath14 $ ]  strengths .",
    "the strengthening of the @xmath0  line from the hot stars is compensated by a dilution of the continuum around the metal lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , which weakens their measured equivalent widths .",
    "these weakened metal lines combined with the stronger @xmath0line serve to preserve the inferred age of the galaxy while lowering the observed metallicity .",
    "we have examined the effect of hot ( horizontal branch ) stars on the inferred stellar population parameters of early - type galaxies using observations of twelve @xmath0-strong early - type galaxies in the coma cluster and spectra drawn from stellar population models as well as an observed spectrum of a metal - poor globular cluster with a purely blue horizontal branch .",
    "if the hot - star light comes from ancient , metal - poor populations @xcite typically contributing @xmath15 per cent of the light at 4000   ( as detected in the caii index ) , the ages of these galaxies are not significantly affected by the correction for this hot - star light . for the oldest , most metal - rich galaxies , this correction can be significant , as shown by @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : hotstars ] . but",
    "this correction is insignificant for the intermediate - aged populations found in these early - type coma galaxies , and likely also for the field and group galaxies studied by @xcite , many of which have similarly high @xmath0  line strengths .",
    "we suggest therefore that the claim that old , metal - poor stars can ` explain away ' the strong @xmath0  lines in these early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is overstated .",
    "the presence of blue straggler stars in these galaxies is still a possibility to explain the enhanced balmer - line strengths of early - type galaxies .",
    "however , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , populations of blue straggler stars are subject to the same constraints as other hot - star populations , as blue straggler stars typically have spectral types around mid - a .",
    "this is the same colour as the bhb stars that dominate the balmer - line strengths of the old , metal - poor populations we have considered here . using the same arguments we have already presented , therefore , we suggest that blue straggler stars are unlikely to affect the inferred ages of @xmath0-strong galaxies . we conclude that _ intermediate - aged populations are still required _ to explain the strong @xmath0  lines in early - type galaxies .",
    "the authors wish to recognise and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have had the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
