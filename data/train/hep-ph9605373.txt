    "<S> when a heavy quark and the corresponding antiquark are separated by more than @xmath0 fm , it becomes energetically favorable for a light quark - antiquark pair to be produced , leading to fragmentation into a pair of flavored mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the relation of this critical quark separation to other dimensional constants of the strong interactions ( such as the pion decay constant , the qcd scale , and the light - quark constituent mass ) is discussed .    </S>",

    "<S> +    the dimensional nature of quantum chromodynamics is manifested in a number of different ways , all of which are plausibly equivalent to one another . </S>",
    "<S> for example : ( 1 ) the scale of low - energy pion - pion interactions is set by the ratios @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are pion 4-momenta and @xmath3 mev is the pion decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) a qcd scale @xmath4 mev whose specific value depends on renormalization scheme is necessary in order to define the strong - coupling constant @xmath5 at a suitable momentum scale . ( 3 ) the masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks as manifested in hadrons can be regarded as `` constituent - quark '' values @xmath8 of order 300  400 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the scale of @xmath8 , while not as precisely defined as @xmath9 or @xmath10 , must be related to these two quantities if , as expected , the limit of zero bare mass for @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks makes sense .    in the present note </S>",
    "<S> we add a quantity to this list . </S>",
    "<S> there appears to be a critical separation between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark for which it is energetically favorable to produce a pair of flavored mesons [ as , for example , in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature was noted in early studies of the @xmath12 system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the explicit magnitude of the interquark separation leading to heavy quarkonium dissociation was not presented . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is of order @xmath0 fm . </S>",
    "<S> this number is of current interest for several reasons .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(1 ) lattice gauge theories are approaching a stage where the dimensional quantities just mentioned ( as well as others ) can be related to one another . </S>",
    "<S> the study of light - quark production between color centers represented by a heavy quark and antiquark is becoming feasible @xcite as one learns to cope with the `` unquenched '' version of qcd in which light quark - antiquark pairs are properly treated .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) the quarkonium systems to which the critical dissociation distance applies include @xmath13 and @xmath14 systems , for which there remain prospects for discovering a few more p - wave and d - wave states , and @xmath15 states , for which there are extensive theoretical studies of the spectroscopy @xcite and a hint of the ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the top quark is too heavy to have a quarkonium spectroscopy ( since its decay width will be greater than the expected level spacing ) , but the critical - separation parameter should still apply to @xmath16 pairs or their products @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) one might expect the critical separation of a pair of static color centers for dissociation into a pair of flavored mesons to be a fundamental parameter in theories @xcite linking heavy - quark physics and chiral perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that a flavor - independent potential @xmath20 describes all bound states @xmath21 of a heavy quark @xmath22 and its antiquark as well as flavored mesons @xmath23 and @xmath24 involving the heavy quark @xmath22 and a light quark @xmath25 . in the notation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we define @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity should tend to a finite limit @xmath27 as @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath29 is the same as the parameter @xmath30 of heavy quark effective theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we seek the value of the critical threshold @xmath21 separation @xmath31 for which @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> a trivial modification permits the description of bound states such as @xmath15 involving unlike - mass quarks </S>",
    "<S> .    the value of @xmath33 will be universal to the extent that ( a ) @xmath27 is well - defined ( as expected in heavy quark effective theory ) , and ( b ) a flavor - independent potential @xmath20 actually provides a good description of the @xmath21 interaction near flavor threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath29 and the light - quark constituent mass @xmath8 are closely related ; neither parameter can be chosen arbitrarily in a theory with given @xmath9 or @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of a flavor - independent potential has been reasonably well borne out @xcite by comparison of @xmath13 and @xmath14 systems , and will be tested further in studies of @xmath15 states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the critical separation using a simple phenomenological potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare it with values obtained in a more model - independent manner , and discuss its relation to other dimensional constants in qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> a satisfactory interpolation between charmonium ( @xmath13 ) and upsilon ( @xmath34 ) states is provided by a potential of the form @xmath35 , with @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 depending upon the specific choice of @xmath38 and @xmath39 quark masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation for the reduced radial wave function @xmath40 of s - wave bound states is [ eqn : schr ] - + c ( ) u = e u  , where @xmath41 is the reduced mass : @xmath42 for a @xmath21 bound state , and @xmath43 . in terms of dimensionless variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 , ( [ eqn : schr ] ) becomes - + u = [ + ( r_0 ) ] u  . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest eigenvalue of this equation is @xmath46 , based on a numerical solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , one may eliminate the parameter @xmath37 in favor of the ground state mass , the parameter @xmath47 , and the reduced mass . </S>",
    "<S> recalling the definition of the radius @xmath31 and setting @xmath48 , we finally have /c + 1.0443 = ( )  .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by neglecting spin - dependent effects in both @xmath21 and @xmath49 systems , and reduced - mass effects in the @xmath49 system . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is most reliable for the @xmath12 levels . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , taking @xmath50 gev , @xmath51 = 9.460 $ ] gev , @xmath52 gev , and a range of @xmath53 between 4.5 and 5 gev , we find the values of @xmath31 shown as the dashed line in fig .  1 .    to account for the hyperfine splittings in the @xmath21 and @xmath49 systems and the reduced - mass effect in the @xmath49 system </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the @xmath54 level is 10 mev above the spin - averaged @xmath55 mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we apply the corrections @xcite ( m_q)_hfs = ( m_b^ * - m_b ) = 69  mev ( ) and ( m_q)_red .  </S>",
    "<S> mass = - c c m_q ( - ) to estimate - ( m_b ) 10  mev + 69  mev - 46  mev = 33  mev  , where the first term is our estimate of the @xmath56 hyperfine term , the second is the contribution of the hyperfine term in @xmath57 , and the third is the reduced - mass effect , estimated for the logarithmic potential . </S>",
    "<S> one is thus assuming such a potential to hold not only for @xmath21 but also for @xmath58 states . we have used a light - quark constituent mass @xcite @xmath59 mev . </S>",
    "<S> with the above corrections , we now estimate the range of @xmath31 shown as the solid line in fig .  1 . the corrected values of @xmath31 range between about 7.6 and 7.2 gev@xmath60 ( 1.5  1.42 fm ) for @xmath61 gev .    for comparison , the dot - dashed line in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 depicts the values of @xmath31 obtained from an inverse - scattering construction of the interquark potential @xcite using the @xmath12 levels . </S>",
    "<S> these values have not been corrected for hyperfine or reduced - mass effects , so they should be compared with the uncorrected values obtained above . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law potential @xcite fitting charmonium and @xmath12 spectra with @xmath62 gev gives @xmath63 gev@xmath60 ( uncorrected ) and 7.6 gev@xmath60 ( corrected ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of the various estimates is fairly good , indicating that model - dependent effects are unlikely to affect the estimate significantly . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in inverse - scattering @xcite and explicit potential @xcite calculations , the shape of any smooth potential which reproduces a given set of energy levels is fairly well specified for the range of energies corresponding to the known levels . once a potential </S>",
    "<S> is required to reproduce the @xmath64 levels and their leptonic widths , that potential s shape is specified between roughly 0.1 fm = 0.5 gev@xmath60 and the interquark separation corresponding to @xmath65 - 2 m_b$ ] , which is just above flavor threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice gauge theories are able to estimate the distance at which a string of chromoelectric flux breaks by the deviation from a linear behavior of the field energy as a function of interquark separation . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear that such a distance corresponds to flavor threshold , since discrete @xmath14 resonances ( and indeed , series of light - quark resonances ) persist well above flavor threshold . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , our estimate of @xmath31 is in accord with an upper bound of @xmath66 fm @xcite ( quoted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as 1.7 fm on the basis of a calculation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) for the breaking of a qcd string obtained using a quenched approximation in lattice gauge theory . in a quenched lattice of size ( 1.5 fm)@xmath67 , </S>",
    "<S> no breaking of a qcd string has been observed ; the linear behavior persists out to the maximum accessible interquark separation </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to see whether at slightly larger distances a linear behavior could actually _ coexist _ with production of light quark - antiquark pairs .    how might the critical spacing parameter @xmath31 be related to other dimensionful quantities in qcd ? </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly related to the constituent - quark mass since a certain amount of chromoelectric energy is required to create the @xmath68 pair . in turn , the constituent - quark mass scale is set @xcite by the need to agree with such quantities as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , whose values are related to the qcd scale @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued @xcite ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> , however , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) that the mass scale of resonances like the @xmath71 meson can be regarded as a number of order @xmath72 in a chirally symmetric theory involving massless pions . in any event </S>",
    "<S> a direct relation between @xmath9 and @xmath73 in a theory of massless pions is highly likely .    </S>",
    "<S> further dimensionful quantities in the strong interactions which might bear a relation to those mentioned include the universal string tension describing the long - distance interquark interaction @xmath74 , @xmath75 gev@xmath76 , and the universal slope @xmath77 of regge trajectories for light - quark systems , @xmath78 gev@xmath79 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the production of light quark - antiquark pairs in a linear potential has been considered some time ago @xcite .    to conclude , we have argued that once a heavy color triplet and antitriplet become separated by more than 1.4  1.5 fm , the chromoelectric flux lines joining them contain sufficient energy to produce a light quark - antiquark pair , leading to the decay of the heavy quarkonium system into a pair of flavored mesons . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to see whether current lattice gauge and chiral theories of non - perturbative qcd could relate this quantity to others which set the qcd scale . </S>"
