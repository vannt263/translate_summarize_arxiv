    "this paper deals with the justification of the two - scale asymptotic expansions method applied to a thermo - diffusion problem arising in the context of transport of densities of hot colloids in media made of periodically - distributed microstructures .",
    "following @xcite , we study a system of two coupled semi - linear parabolic equations , where the diffusivity for the concentration @xmath1 is of order @xmath2 and for the temperature @xmath3 it is of order @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes the characteristic length scale of the underlying microstructure .",
    "we rigorously justify the expansions @xmath6 and @xmath7 and prove an estimate of the type @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the macroscopic domain and @xmath10 is the perforated reference cell .",
    "estimate basically gives a quantitative indication of the speed of the ( two - scale ) convergence between the unknowns of our problem and their limits , which is detailed in the forthcoming sections .",
    "this work follows up previous successful attempts of deriving quantitative corrector estimates using periodic unfolding ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the unfolding technique allows for homogenization results under minimal regularity assumptions on the data and on the choice of allowed microstructures .",
    "the novelty we bring in here is the combination of three aspects : ( i ) the asymptotic procedure refers to a suitably perforated domain , ( ii ) presence of a cross coupling in gradient terms , and ( iii ) lack of compactness for @xmath3 .",
    "our working techniques combines @xmath0-independent a priori estimates for the solutions and periodic unfolding - based estimates such as the _ periodicity defect _ in @xcite and the _ folding mismatch _ in @xcite .",
    "estimate improves existing convergence rates for semi - linear parabolic equations with possibly non - linear boundary conditions in @xcite or small diffusivity in @xcite from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "this improvement is obtained by studying all equations in the two - scale space @xmath13 and by suitably rearranging and controlling occurring error terms @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noting that the availability of corrector estimates for the thermo - diffusion system allows in principle the construction of rigorously convergent multiscale numerical methods ( for instance based on msfem like in @xcite ) to capture thermo - diffusion effects in porous media .",
    "interestingly , for the thermo - diffusion system posed in perforated domains such convergent multiscale numerical methods are yet unavailable .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the thermo - diffusion model and prove existence as well as a priori estimates for the solutions of the microscopic problem respective the two - scale limit problem . the periodic unfolding method and auxiliary corrector estimates are presented in section [ subsec : two - scale ] and [ subsec : auxiliary ] , respectively .",
    "finally , the corrector estimates in are proved in section [ subsec : proof ] .",
    "we conclude our paper with a discussion in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we investigate a system of reaction - diffusion equations which includes mollified cross - diffusion terms and different diffusion length scales .",
    "the cross - diffusion terms are motivated by the incorporation of soret and dufour effects as outlined in @xcite . for more information on phenomenological descriptions of thermo - diffusion ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the concentrations of the transported species through the perforated domain @xmath15 are denoted by @xmath1 , while @xmath3 is the temperature . the overall interplay between transport and reaction is modeled here by the following system of partial differential equations : @xmath16 supplemented with the neumann boundary conditions @xmath17 and the initial conditions @xmath18 first of all , it is important to note that the @xmath0-scaling for some of the terms in the system is variable with @xmath19 .",
    "we refer to the suitably scaled heat conduction - diffusion interaction terms @xmath20 and @xmath21 as `` weak thermal couplings '' , while the `` high - contrast '' is thought here particularly in terms of the heat conduction properties of the composite material that can be seen in @xmath22 . in this context , @xmath23 denotes the normal outer unit vector of @xmath15 . the matrix @xmath24 is the diffusivity associated to the concentration of the ( diffusive ) species @xmath1 ,",

    "note that @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are either positive definite matrices , or they are positive real numbers .",
    "furthermore , the reaction term @xmath30 models the smoluchovski interaction production . in the original model from @xcite ,",
    "the function @xmath31 is an additional unknown modeling the mass of deposited species on the pore surface @xmath32 , and it is shown to possess the regularity @xmath33 .",
    "here we assume @xmath31 as given data .",
    "we point out that the linear boundary terms are relevant for the regularity of solutions , but that they are not required to prove the convergence rate of order of @xmath34 in .    to deal with perforated domains we employ the method of periodic unfolding as presented in @xcite .",
