    "the dynamics of spatially extended systems has been a focus of intense research activity in the past two decades . in recent years",
    "it has become evident that modeling large interactive systems by finite dimensional lattices on one hand and fully random networks on the other , is inadequate , as various networks , ranging from collaborations of scientists to metabolic networks , do not fit in either paradigm @xcite .",
    "some alternate scenarios have been suggested , and one of the most popular ones is the small - world network @xcite . here one starts with a structure on a lattice , for instance regular nearest neighbor connections .",
    "then each link from a site to its nearest neighbor is rewired randomly with probability @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ the site is connected to another randomly chosen lattice site .",
    "this model is proposed to mimic real life situations in which non - local connections exist along with predominantly local connections .",
    "there is much evidence that random non - local connections , even in a small fraction , significantly affects geometrical properties , like characteristic path length @xcite .",
    "however its _ implications for dynamical characteristics is still unclear and even conflicting_. while the dynamics of coupled oscillators and coupled maps on regular lattices ( known as ` coupled map lattices ' or cmls ) has been extensively investigated @xcite , there have been far fewer studies on the spatiotemporal dynamics of nonlinear elements on networks of different topologies @xcite .",
    "most studies so far have indicated that the regularity of systems increase monotonically with @xmath0 @xcite .    in this paper we will provide evidence of a system where the dependence of spatiotemporal regularity on the degree of randomness in coupling connections is highly _ non - universal_. we will show how this dependence ranges from _ monotonically increasing _ to _ monotonically decreasing _",
    ", via _ non - monotonic variation _ , as the local dynamics changes .",
    "thus we will demonstrate that the interplay between local dynamics and connectivity acts in non - trivial and non - intuitive ways , and so even the qualitative effect of random links on spatiotemporal regularity can be completely reversed by changing the nodal dynamics .",
    "here we consider nonlinear oscillators coupled to nearest neighbors on a regular ring , with some fraction @xmath0 of the regular links rewired randomly .",
    "the individual sites ( nodes ) are modeled by sine circle maps , which have widespread relevance for oscillatory phenomena @xcite , and are given as : @xmath1 wherein @xmath2 measures the strength of the nonlinear term , and @xmath3 represents the natural frequency of the map in the absence of nonlinearity ( i.e. when @xmath4 ) .",
    "we restrict our studies to the parameter region : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this region ,",
    "the single sine circle map settles down to the spatiotemporal fixed point , @xmath7 .    under diffusive coupling , such a coupled sine - circle map lattice ,",
    "is given as : @xmath8 \\pmod{1 } x_{n+1 } ( i ) = ( 1-\\epsilon ) f(x_n(i ) ) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2 } [ f(x_n(i-1 ) ) + f(x_n(i+1 ) ) ] \\pmod{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the site index , @xmath10 denotes the time index , and @xmath11 represents the coupling strength between the sites ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used , namely one has a ring of oscillators .",
    "earlier studies of this coupled map lattice have been carried out for various types of initial conditions @xcite . in particular",
    ", the evolution of this coupled map lattice with random initial conditions shows interesting spatiotemporal dynamics including spatiotemporal fixed points , spatial and spatiotemporal intermittency , and spatiotemporal chaos @xcite .",
    "now we introduce randomness in this regular lattice by rewiring the nearest neighbor links with a probability @xmath0 to randomly chosen sites on the lattice . here",
    "we consider the behavior of the system under _",
    "static rewiring _ ,",
    "namely , the randomness in spatial coupling is quenched or `` frozen '' in time .",
    "ensembles of such randomly rewired systems are studied .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in the case of @xmath13 , as displayed in figure [ e5ovar](d ) , the basin of attraction _ decreases _ to zero as the rewiring fraction is increased . in this case",
    ", the system settles to the spatiotemporal fixed point @xmath14 for smaller rewiring fractions , but exhibits a complex spatial pattern when the degree of rewiring in the system is increased .",
    "this is further illustrated in the bifurcation diagram of the system shown in figure [ bifur](b ) .",
    "this is exactly the opposite trend to that observed in the case of @xmath15 .",
    "so , as the local frequency of the nonlinear oscillator changes , the effect of random rewiring on spatiotemporal properties is completely reversed .    hence , we see that for the same coupling strength @xmath11 , and for the same set of rewired configurations , the basin of attraction of the spatiotemporal fixed point shows a very strong dependence on the local dynamics , namely on the frequency @xmath3 of the nonlinear oscillators .",
    "so it is evident that the spatiotemporal regularity depends crucially , not just quantitatively , but also qualitatively , on the nodal dynamics .",
    "similarly , when the nodal dynamics is fixed and the coupling strength @xmath11 is varied , we see that the basin of attraction shows a non - monotonic variation with change in rewiring fraction @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ o01evar ] where the basin of attraction has been plotted for @xmath16 and for various representative values of the coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "hence , spatiotemporal regularity of the dynamics on a network depends quite crucially on the interplay between the nodal dynamics and the network topology .",
    "that is , coupling configurations with the same degree of randomness may enhance or inhibit spatiotemporal order depending on the properties of the local oscillators .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of a network of coupled nonlinear oscillators , modeled by sine circle maps , with varying degrees of randomness in coupling connections .",
    "we showed that the variation of the basin of attraction of the spatiotemporal fixed point , with increasing fraction of random links @xmath0 , crucially depends on the nature of the local dynamics .",
    "even the qualitative relationship between spatiotemporal regularity and @xmath0 changes drastically as the angular frequency of the oscillators change , ranging from monotonic increase or decrease , to non - monotonic variation .",
    "thus it is evident that the influence of random coupling connections on spatiotemporal order is highly non - universal here and depends strongly on the angular frequency of the nodal oscillators .",
    "this implies that the delicate interplay between local dynamics and connectivity is crucial in determining the emergence of spatiotemporal order in complex networks of dynamical elements .",

    "note that the average time taken by the system to relax to the spatiotemporal fixed point in the large @xmath0 regime ( @xmath17 ) , grows exponentially with @xmath0 , and the configurations eventually relax to the spatiotemporal fixed point with probability @xmath18 , but only at asymptotically long times .",
