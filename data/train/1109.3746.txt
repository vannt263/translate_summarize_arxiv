    "almost scale - invariant and gaussian primordial cosmological perturbations predicted by inflation are consistent with observational data . while this suggests that inflation did happen in the early universe ,",
    "there still remain many important questions about inflation .",
    "one of the most important problems is to distinguish between various inflationary models as there are still many models that are consistent with observational data at present . for this purpose , it is necessary to have further information about the early universe such as deviations from gaussianity ( non - gaussianity ) of the primordial perturbations and primordial gravitational waves . in this paper , we focus on primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "actually , the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations provide crucial information on the physics of the very early universe @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the simplest single field inflation models where the scalar field has a canonical kinetic term and quantum fluctuations are generated from the standard bunch - davis vacuum , non - gaussianity of the fluctuations is too small to be observed even with future experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , the detection of non - negligible deviations from gaussianity of primordial fluctuations will have a huge impact on the models of the early universe .",
    "so far , most of the studies have focused on the leading order non - gaussianity measured by the three - point function of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , i.e. the bispectrum @xcite . especially , the optimal method of extracting the bispectrum from the cmb data has been sufficiently developed @xcite ( for a more general approach , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the bispectrum includes only a part of information about non - gaussianity and many models can predict similar bispectra .",
    "for example , k - inflation @xcite and dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation @xcite are shown to predict almost equilateral type bispectrum ( see @xcite for reviews ) . however",
    ", future experiments like planck @xcite can also prove the higher order statistics such as the trispectrum @xcite which gives information that can not be obtained from the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianity of the observed cmb anisotropies comes from not only the primordial origin but also the non - linear effects in the cmb at late times such as the coupling between integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect and the weak gravitational lensing  @xcite .",
    "however , these non - linear effects can be negligible compared with the primordial non - gaussainity in the models such as dbi inflation and ghost inflation where large primordial non - gaussianity is predicted and it is the dominant contribution to the observed non - gaussianity . in this paper , we focus on large primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "while the trispectrum has more information , it requires more work to understand how to distinguish between various trispectra predicted in many theoretical models and how to measure the amplitude of the trispectrum because it has more parameters than the bispectrum . to estimate an overlap between the shapes of two different trispectra ,",
    "the shape correlator was introduced by regan et.al @xcite based on the reduced trispectrum .",
    "furthermore , based on this shape correlator , two of us investigated an estimator @xmath0 to measure the amplitude of the trispectrum in some equilateral type non - gaussian models , like k - inflation , single field dbi inflation and multi - field dbi inflation @xcite .",
    "recently , the shape dependence of the trispectra from ghost inflation model  @xcite and lifshitz scalar model have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "these models are known to give equilateral type bispectra . for lifshitz scalar model",
    ", we will see that there is no natural way to decompose the full trispectrum into the reduced trispectra in some cases and the shape correlator based on the reduced trispectrum is not necessarily well - defined .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we consider an implementation of the shape correlator of the primordial trispectrum using the full trispectrum so that we can calculate the shape correlations and investigate estimators in equilateral type non - gaussian models including ghost inflation and lifshitz scalar .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ shapecorrelator ] , we introduce two shape correlators defined in different ways where one is defined based on the reduced trispectrum and the other is based on the full trispectrum . in section  [ shapecorrelations ] , we calculate the shape correlations of the trispectra among various theoretical models ; dbi inflation , ghost inflation and lifshitz scalar . in section",
    "iv , we express the estimators @xmath0 in terms of the model parameters , which is useful to constrain the model parameters from future experiments .",
    "we also give constraints on model parameters using wmap constraints on @xmath1 obtained in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary and discussions of this paper . in appendix sections",
    "[ appdbi ] , [ appg ] and [ apph ] , we review the shape functions of the reduced trispectra in dbi inflation model , ghost inflation model and lifshitz scalar model .",
    "in this section , we introduce two shape correlators .",
    "one is introduced by regan  @xcite and we review this method in section  [ regan ] . in this method , the shape correlators are defined based on the reduced trispectrum .",
    "although the reduced trispectum includes all information of the original trispectrum , there is no unique way to decompose the total trispectrum into the reduced trispectrum .",
    "then there appears an ambiguity in the definition of shape correlator based on the reduced trispectrum ; a different choice of the reduced trispectrum gives a different shape correlator . before discussing the shape correlators , we review the definition of the trispectrum .",
    "the trispectrum @xmath2 of the curvature perturbation @xmath3 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a fourier component with the momentum @xmath6 and the subscript  @xmath7 \" in the left hand side denotes the connected component .",
    "the trispectrum @xmath2 generally depends on four three - momenta , namely twelve parameters .",
    "assuming isotropy and homogeneity of the universe on large scales , the number of parameters reduces to six .      here , we review the shape correlator discussed in @xcite .",
    "first we exploit the symmetry of the trispectrum to define the reduced trispectrum as follows  @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the definition of the trispectrum as @xmath8\\ , .",
    "\\label{defrtri}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the symmetry of the trispectrum , the reduced trispectrum includes all information of the original trispectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , this decomposition of the trispectrum is not unique because there is an ambiguity in choosing * k * in eq .",
    "( [ defrtri ] ) . in some cases , there is a natural choice of the reduced trispectrum .",
    "for example , in the case of trispectrum produced by two three - point vertices , it consists of s- , t- and u - channels",
    ". then we can decompose the trispectrum into three parts accordingly and define the reduced trispectrum in a natural way .",

    "but it is possible to check that the dependence on this factor is not very significant when the shape correlation is sufficiently large , like @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath16 regan et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to define an inner product between two different shape functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an appropriate weight function .",

    "@xmath25 the integration range of the momenta @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 in the integral of eq .",
    "( [ pritrispectrum_correlator_part ] ) is determined by the triangle inequality of the momenta .",
    "namely , the conditions to satisfy @xmath31 are @xmath32 moreover , from the momentum conservation we obtain @xmath33 , and thus the conditions @xmath34 must be also imposed .",
    "the integration range of @xmath35 is fixed by inequality  ( [ const_costheta4 ] ) . due to the symmetry under interchange of @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we can confine the integration range to @xmath36 . with this choice of weight ,",
    "the shape correlator is defined as @xmath37      in this subsection , we implement the shape correlator using the full trispectrum @xmath38 . as we mentioned in the previous subsection , while the reduced trispectrum has all information of the original trispectrum , the decomposition of the full trispectrum into the reduced trispectra is not unique . if all momenta appear symmetrically in the definition of the correlator , the obtained correlation is independent of the choice of the reduced trispectrum . however , the definition given by eq .",
    "( [ pritrispectrum_correlator_part ] ) apparently breaks the symmetry because of the integration variables @xmath30 and @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in order to define the correlator uniquely , we must use the full trispectrum in the definition of the shape correlator .",
    "the shape correlator based on the full trispectrum is defined in a similar way with the one based on the reduced trispectrum .",
    "namely , we begin with defining the shape function as @xmath39 the inner product is defined as @xmath40 where we use the same weight function @xmath20 as that in the case of reduced trispectrum .",
    "the domain of integration in eq .",
    "( [ pritrispectrumt_correlator_part ] ) is basically the same as that for the reduced trispectrum , i.e. inequalities  ( [ const_costheta4 ] ) , ( [ range12 ] ) and ( [ range34 ] ) .",
    "however , since the symmetry under interchange of @xmath26 and @xmath27 still remains , the additional condition @xmath36 does not change the final value of the shape correlator.therefore , we adopt inequalities  ( [ const_costheta4 ] ) , ( [ range12 ] ) , ( [ range34 ] ) and @xmath36 as the domain of integration .",
    "the shape correlator is defined in the same way @xmath41",
    "in this section , we explicitly calculate the shape correlations among trispectra predicted by various theoretical models .",
    "the main purpose of investing the trispectrum is discriminating between models which are hard to be distinguished by the bispectrum .",
    "thus we concentrate on the shape correlations among the models where the bispectrum is dominated by the equilateral type one ; single field and multi - field dbi inflation models , ghost inflation model and lifshitz scalar model .",
    "the explicit forms of the shape functions are calculated in appendixes .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as the shape functions in single field dbi inflation , multi - field dbi inflation and ghost inflation , respectively .",
    "explicit forms of them are written in eqs.([singleshapefunction ] ) , ( [ multishapefunction ] ) and ( [ ghostshapefunction ] ) . in lifshitz",
    "scalar field , there are a few contributions of trispectrum and it depends on the parameters in the theory .",
    "we define @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 as the shape functions of respective contributions .",
    "we show explicit forms of them in eqs.([horavaseshapefunction ] ) and ( [ sci ] ) .    furthermore , the shape given by @xmath51 ( see eq .",
    "( [ shape_c1 ] ) ) can be written in a separable form @xcite and it provides a fast estimator for the equilateral type trispectrum @xcite .",
    "this means that if the shape function for the trispectrum is highly correlated with @xmath51 , we can constrain the model parameters from the amplitude of the trispectrum in a very simple and fast way as we will discuss in sec .",
    "iv . therefore",
    ", we also calculate the shape correlations of the trispectra predicted by theories mentioned above with @xmath51 .",
    "another motivation for calculating the shape correlations is to check the difference between the two shape correlators that we introduced in the previous section .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , the shape correlation based on the reduced trispectrum depends on the way to decompose the full trispectrum into the reduced trispectra .",
    "thus strictly speaking , we should use the full tripsectrum when calculating the shape correlation .",
    "however , the calculation is easier for the shape correlation using the reduced trispectrum .",
    "if the difference is insignificant , we may still use the reduced trispectrum to calculate the shape correlator .",
    "inner propagator , height=75 ]    here , we calculate the shape correlations among the theoretical models based on the reduced trispectrum .",
    "we must specify how we decompose the full trispectrum into reduced trispectra .",
    "one natural way is to decompose it so that one of the reduced trispectrum depends only on five parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . except for the case of the trispectrum obtained by the contact interaction in lifshitz scalar model for @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ sci ] ) , it is possible to find such a decomposition .",
    "in fact , in the case of the scalar exchange trispectrum , this is always the case .",
    "the contribution of the trispectrum from the scalar exchange can be decomposed into s- , t- and u - channels and one of the channel depends only on five parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the diagram of the scalar exchange trispectrum has one inner propagator . in the diagram where the momentum of the inner propagator is @xmath30 , the propagators with momenta @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 meet directly at one vertex . on the other hand , the propagators with momenta @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath29 meet at the other vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : se.eps ] ) .",

    "[ fig : se.eps ] is written in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the inner products @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the trispectrum from fig .",
    "[ fig : se.eps ] depends only on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , in most models even the contact interaction trispectrum can be also decomposed in such a way that the reduced trispectrum only depends on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the contact interaction , there are no inner propagators . thus the dependence on @xmath30 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 stem only from the derivative coupling such as @xmath60 .",
    "only when the product of @xmath30 and @xmath58 appear in a contact interaction trispectrum , the trispectrum can not be decomposed in the way so that reduced trispectrum depends only on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
