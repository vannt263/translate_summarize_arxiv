    "emission and scattering processes thought to be important in many astrophysical x - ray sources are likely to impart specific polarization signatures , but to date there have only been a few positive detections of polarization from cosmic x - ray sources , largely due to sensitivity limitations .",
    "some of the earliest and highest precision measurements were made with the oso-8 bragg reflection polarimeter ( kestenbaum et al .",
    "1976 ; weisskopf et al .",
    "1976 ) , and include high significance measurements of the linear polarization properties of the crab nebula in several energy bands ( weisskopf et al . 1978 ) .",
    "more recently , observations with the _ integral _ spectrometer spi and imager ibis have exploited the polarization dependence of compton scattering to infer the linear polarization properties of the crab at @xmath13-ray energies ( dean et al .",
    "2008 ; forot et al .",
    "these results indicate that the @xmath14 kev flux from the crab nebula is highly polarized ( @xmath15 ) , with a position angle consistent with the pulsar rotation axis .    in the last few years",
    "the development of micropattern gas detectors has enabled the capability to directly image the charge tracks produced by photoelectrons , thus enabling use of photoelectric absorption in a detection gas as a direct probe of x - ray polarization ( costa et al .",
    "2001 ; black et al . 2004 ; 2010 ) .",
    "it is likely that such technology will be employed in the not - too - distant future to sensitively explore the polarization properties of many classes of astrophysical x - ray sources for the first time .    in this paper",
    "we explore the question of how one detects , measures , and characterizes a polarization signal with a photoelectric polarimeter .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows ; in  2 we outline the basic problem of detecting a modulation in a distribution of angles , and we describe the angle distributions used throughout the paper . in ",
    "3 we briefly outline the probability distribution relevant to such polarization measurements . in ",
    "4 we describe our monte carlo simulations and present our results .",
    "we conclude with a short summary in  5 .",
    "the angular distribution of photoelectrons ejected by a linearly polarized beam of photons ( x - rays ) is proportional to @xmath16 ( see , for example , costa et al .",
    "2001 ) , where @xmath17 is the emission angle measured from the direction of the incident photon ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle measured relative to the polarization vector of the incident photon ( see figure 1 for the basic geometry applicable to a photoelectric polarimeter ) . in most practical situations the angle @xmath17 is not inferred directly , but the electron charge track projected into the plane orthogonal to the direction of the photon ( the plane defined by @xmath19 deg ) is imaged and thus @xmath5 can be estimated for each detected photon .",
    "the angle @xmath5 is measured around the line of sight to the target of interest and can be referenced to , for example , local north on the sky . in principle @xmath5 can be measured in the range from @xmath20 ( 0 - 360 degrees ) , however , due to the two - fold symmetry of the @xmath21 dependence of the angular distribution above , it is sufficient to consider distributions over the range of angles from 0 to @xmath22 ( 0 - 180 degrees ) .",
    "the presence of a significant linear polarization component is then evident in the distribution of azimuthal angles .",
    "for example , an unpolarized photon flux will produce a uniform distribution in the angle @xmath5 , whereas a linear polarization component produces a distribution peaked at a particular azimuthal angle , @xmath23 .",
    "we emphasize that such a polarimeter does not require rotation of the detector to achieve its sensitivity .",
    "rather , because a photoelectron is ejected preferentially  though with a quantum mechanical probability distribution  along the polarization vector of the photon ,",
    "measurement of the distribution of the azimuthal angles of photoelectrons provides a _ direct _ probe of the linear polarization properties of the source .    due to the @xmath24 dependence of the angular distribution of photoelectrons , the observed number density of photon events with measured angle between @xmath5 and @xmath25 , which we denote as @xmath26 ,",
    "can be expressed in the form ( see , for example , pacciani et al .",
    "2003 ; costa et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath27    the total intensity of photons is then just the integral , @xmath28 , which in this case can be readily shown to be @xmath29 . from equation 1 the unpolarized ( unmodulated ) component of the intensity",
    "is evidently @xmath30 , and since the total intensity can be expressed as the sum of the polarized and unpolarized intensities , the polarized intensity is then simply @xmath31 .",
    "this angular distribution has an amplitude of modulation defined as , @xmath32 , and a position angle ( the angle at which the distribution has a maximum ) given by @xmath23 , thus , the detection of polarization can be reduced to a statistical detection of a modulation in the distribution of angles , @xmath5 .",
    "such a distribution is often referred to as a modulation curve .",
    "now , the amplitude of modulation @xmath4 is not in general equal to the source polarization amplitude , @xmath33 , because a detector is not a perfect analyzer and will not provide an exact measurement of the true photoelectron angle @xmath5 .",
    "that is , individual angle estimates will have some uncertainty associated with them and these will produce a uniform ( unmodulated ) component to the measured distribution even in the case of a 100% polarized beam .",
    "this `` lossiness '' of the angle estimates is quantified in terms of the so - called detector modulation , @xmath34 , which is the modulation amplitude produced in the detector by a 100% polarized x - ray beam .",
    "in general , @xmath34 can depend on a number of factors , including the energy of the incident photons , and the composition and pressure of the absorbing gas , among others ( see paciani et al .",
    "2003 , bellazini et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the absence of background ,",
    "the amplitude of polarization is just @xmath35 . in general",
    ", @xmath33 is larger than the measured amplitude of modulation , @xmath4 , because as noted above , detectors are not 100% efficient , and some of the intrinsic polarization amplitude is smeared out .",
    "an x - ray source s linear polarization characteristics can thus be described by the modulation amplitude , @xmath4 , and position angle , @xmath5 ( in the range from 0 - @xmath22 ) , that would be produced in a particular detector system . in making an observation a total of @xmath36 photons",
    "are observed for each of which an angle @xmath37 is estimated for the ejected photoelectron in the range from @xmath38 ( 0 - 180 deg ) .",
    "one can then create a histogram , or modulation curve , of the number of events ( photons ) , @xmath39 , in each of @xmath40 position angle bins , where the bin size ( in degrees ) is @xmath41 , and then perform least - squares ( @xmath1 ) fitting to estimate both @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and their @xmath11 uncertainties .",
    "we call this a measurement of polarization . the counts in any position angle bin ,",
    "@xmath39 , are independent , poisson - distributed random variables whose expectation value is determined by @xmath42 .",
    "it is the statistics of such measurements that we explore in the remainder of this paper . in effect",
    ", what is measured is the modulation amplitude , @xmath4 , and it is the knowledge of the detector system , expressed in terms of @xmath34 , that enables this to be converted to a source polarization amplitude via the expression @xmath35 .    with the help of some trigonometric identities equation 1 can be re - written as , @xmath43 \\ ; , \\ ] ] which is equivalent to , @xmath44 if we define @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , this gives the so - called stokes decomposition ( in this case specific to linear polarization ) ,    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the well - known stokes parameters .",
    "the modulation amplitude , @xmath52 , can now be written as @xmath53 , and by dividing @xmath50 by @xmath51 we can express the position angle as @xmath54 .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that in this form the unpolarized intensity is given by @xmath55 , and the polarized intensity @xmath56 .",
    "the sum of these gives the total intensity , @xmath57 .",
    "we note that the form of equation 4 is familiar as a partial fourier series , with the stokes parameters as the fourier coefficients .",
    "we can argue that they are gaussian distributed random variables to good approximation as long as a reasonably large number of position angle bins are used to construct the modulation curves . to see this we sketch an example of how one of the stokes parameters can be expressed as a fourier coefficient .",
    "if we multiply both sides of equation ( 4 ) by @xmath58 and integrate we obtain , @xmath59 because of the angular integrals only the 2nd term on the right - hand side of equation ( 5 ) is non - zero , leading to the following expression for @xmath51 , @xmath60 now , this integral can be approximated as a sum over all bins in the measured ( or simulated ) modulation curve with @xmath61 , the number of photon events in each bin .",
    "since the @xmath39 are random , poisson distributed values their sum will approach a normal distribution as m ( the number of bins in the modulation curve ) becomes large enough via the central limit theorem .",
    "while this ensures that the distributions will tend toward the normal distribution , it does not necessarily enforce statistical independence of the parameters , but this can be tested carefully with monte carlo simulations .",
    "below we show that under such circumstances the stokes parameters are not completely independent , but that in the limit of small amplitudes the approximation of independence is a very good one .",
    "indeed , we show that while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are statistically independent , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are correlated with @xmath49 in an amplitude - dependent manner .",
    "moreover , we show that the distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are characterized by a variance that decreases with increasing amplitude .",
    "assuming the independent and normally distributed properties of the stokes parameters are satisfied , previous studies have shown that the joint probability distribution for a measurement of linear polarization characterized by amplitude , @xmath4 , and position angle , @xmath5 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath4 , @xmath63 , @xmath5 , @xmath23 , and @xmath36 are the measured amplitude , the true amplitude , the measured position angle , the true position angle , and the number of detected photons , respectively ( see , for example , simmons & stewart 1985 ; vaillancourt 2006 ; weisskopf , elsner & odell 2010 ) . in the case of no intrinsic polarization , @xmath64",
    ", the distribution simplifies substantially to @xmath65 and this expression can be readily integrated to find the probability of measuring an amplitude , @xmath4 , if there is no intrinsic polarization .",
    "the amplitude that has a 1% chance of being measured is referred to as the _ minimum detectable amplitude _ ( mda ) , and it is relatively straightforward to show that @xmath66 .",
    "the polarization amplitude that would produce this modulation amplitude in a particular detector system is called the _ minimum detectable polarization _ ( mdp ) , and based on the discussion above is just @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , if we are not concerned with the position angle , @xmath5 , then we can integrate equation ( 3 ) over angles and obtain the distribution , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the modified bessel function of order zero , and @xmath70 .",
    "this distribution is known as the rice distribution ( rice 1945 ) and it reflects the fact that the amplitude is always a positive quantity , and so the distribution must go to zero for @xmath71 .",
    "an important property of this distribution concerns the second moment , which is related to the width , and is given by : @xmath72 which shows that the distribution width increases with @xmath63 .",
    "the rice distribution has relevance to a number of other research fields , including various signal processing applications ( abdi et al .",
    "2001 ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( sijbers et al .",
    "1998 ) and radar signal analysis ( nilsson & glisson 1980 ; marzetta 1995 ) .",
    "it is a common goal in many of these applications to estimate the amplitude parameter , @xmath4 , of the rice distribution from observed data .",
    "we note that the x - ray polarization case discussed here has similarities to these other applications but is more general in the sense that one is often interested in estimating both the amplitude , @xmath4 , as well as the position angle , @xmath5 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore and compare a wide range of different parameter estimation methods , rather , here we focus on the case of least squares fitting using @xmath1 methods .",
    "we emphasize that the probability distribution given in the previous section is only rigorously correct under the assumption that the stokes parameters are normally distributed and independent . here",
    "we begin by exploring the accuracy of that assumption .",
    "the procedure of generating modulation curves based on a particular choice of @xmath42 is quite amenable to simulation with monte carlo techniques , and here we present results of such simulations , both in the case with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and essentially map - out the exact probability density numerically .",
    "for now we ignore background considerations and work only in terms of modulation amplitudes , that is , the following results can be considered applicable to any detector system , regardless of the @xmath34 value that characterizes its polarization sensitivity ( see elsner , odell & weisskopf 2012 for further discussion on the effect of backgrounds ) .",
    "the simulations proceed as follows , for a given set of true parameter values , @xmath63 and @xmath23 , we compute a number , @xmath75 , of simulated data sets .",
    "the total number of events in a particular realization is poisson distributed with a mean of @xmath36 photons . for the case of @xmath64 the distribution of angles , @xmath5 , is uniform , which can be readily simulated with a random number generator that produces uniform deviates . when @xmath74 we sample random angles from the true distributions by the so - called transformation method .",
    "we first compute the cumulative distribution of @xmath76 , then draw uniform deviates , @xmath77 , and find the corresponding value of @xmath78 in the cumulative distribution .",
    "we use the root finder _",
    "zbrent _ implemented in _",
    "idl _ to solve for @xmath5 given @xmath77 .",
    "we can thus draw a specific number of random events , @xmath36 , from any true distribution .    for each simulated data",
    "set we bin the resulting angles to form a modulation curve and for each the stokes form of the distribution ( equation 4 ) is fitted to determine best - fit values for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath49 , and their @xmath11 uncertainties , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "we can then use the fitted stokes parameters to express the results in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath5 using the expressions defined above .",
    "the @xmath11 uncertainties , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , can also be estimated by standard error propagation methods , which yields , @xmath84 and @xmath85 where , @xmath86 , and @xmath81 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the standard @xmath11 uncertainties on the fitted quantities , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the procedure can then be repeated with different values of @xmath36 .",
    "all the monte carlo simulations described here were done using _ idl _ , and uniform deviates were obtained with _",
    "idl s _ random number generator _",
    "randomu_. we use a least - squares fitting routine developed within _",
    "idl _ that is based on minpack-1 ( markwardt 2009 ) . in all of the least squares",
    "fits all parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "the basic procedure is illustrated in figure 2 , which shows a simulated modulation curve ( solid histogram with error bars ) and best fitting model ( smooth black curve ) .",
    "the fitted stokes parameter components are also indicated and labelled .",
    "this example is a single statistical realization of 15,000 events in @xmath87 angle bins from the distribution @xmath88 .",
    "the best - fit values and @xmath11 standard errors from the fit for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , respectively",
    ". the inferred amplitude and position angle are @xmath92 and @xmath93 deg , and are entirely consistent with the true values @xmath94 , and @xmath95 deg .    from the results of many such simulations",
    "one can compute the distributions of the fitted parameters , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in doing this",
    "we confirm that these distributions are gaussian to very good accuracy .",
    "examples are given in figure 3 , which shows the resulting distributions of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( with their means subtracted ) from 10,000 realizations using the same angular distribution as used to produce figure 2 , but with @xmath96 .",
    "since the mean - subtracted distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 were consistent with each other , we fit a gaussian model to the summed distribution .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian models are also plotted in figure 3 .",
    "we next explored simulations using a wide range of intrinsic amplitudes , @xmath63 , and searched for correlations amongst the resulting mean - subtracted distributions . from this analysis",
    "it is evident that the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are statistically independent for any intrinsic amplitude .",
    "that is , a scatter plot of @xmath97 versus @xmath98 is circularly symmetric about the origin .",
    "however , we find that both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not independent of @xmath49 , indeed they are correlated in a manner which is proportional to the intrinsic amplitude .",
    "figure 4 shows a pair of scatter plots computed from a simulation using the angular distribution @xmath99 , which has a large modulation amplitude of @xmath100 .",
    "plotted are the mean - subtracted best - fit values of @xmath49 versus @xmath50 ( black symbols ) , and @xmath50 versus @xmath51 ( red symbols ) for 100,000 realizations .",
    "these simulations were computed with a mean number of counts @xmath101 .",
    "a positive correlation is evident in the @xmath49 versus @xmath50 points ( black symbols ) , but the @xmath50 versus @xmath51 distribution appears circularly symmetric , that is , uncorrelated . to further quantify this",
    "we also computed the linear correlation coefficients as a function of amplitude for a set of simulations .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 where the coefficients for @xmath50 versus @xmath51 , @xmath50 versus @xmath49 , and @xmath51 versus @xmath49 are denoted by the `` error bar , '' `` square , '' and `` @xmath102 '' symbols , respectively .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are uncorrelated , but that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are both correlated with @xmath49 , with the magnitude of the correlation coefficient increasing with amplitude .",
    "in addition , we find that the variance of the distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 depends on the intrinsic amplitude . to quantify this effect we computed the fractional change in the standard deviation , @xmath103 , for each fitted parameter ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) from a large suite of simulations . because the variance of the distributions in @xmath50 and @xmath51 are equal , as a practical matter we compute the average of the two . here , @xmath104 is the standard deviation of each fitted parameter computed from simulations , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the distributions in @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "these are the expected variances in the limit that the intrinsic amplitude is small and equation ( 7 ) is exact .",
    "the results are shown in figure 6 , where the values for @xmath49 and the average of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 distributions are denoted by the `` diamond '' and `` square '' symbols , respectively .",
    "each pair of points here was computed from 400,000 realizations . from figure 6",
    "it is evident that the variance of @xmath49 is independent of the amplitude and is consistent with @xmath105 , but that the variance in both @xmath50 and @xmath51 is systematically smaller than @xmath107 in an amplitude - dependent manner .",
    "the inset panel of figure 6 shows a zoom - in of the low amplitude portion of the plot , and demonstrates that the change is quite small for low amplitudes .",
    "even at an amplitude of @xmath108 the percentage decrease in the standard deviation is only about @xmath109 .",
    "however , above @xmath10 the deviation increases sharply , and approaches @xmath8 as the amplitude reaches unity .",
    "a polynomial in powers of the amplitude ( up to @xmath110 ) provides a good fit to the values for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 distributions from these simulations , and this functional form is the solid curve in figure 6 .",
    "it has the form @xmath111 .",
    "the best fitting coefficients for @xmath112 through @xmath113 are , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the above results demonstrate that for the measurement of modulation curves appropriate to x - ray polarimetric data the stokes parameters are independent , gaussian random variables to good approximation as long as the intrinsic amplitude is not too large .",
    "our results have quantified how accurate the approximation is as a function of the modulation amplitude .",
    "for example , even at an intrinsic amplitude of @xmath108 the distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are only about @xmath109 narrower than the same distributions at zero amplitude .",
    "thus , for many applications use of equation ( 7 ) is warranted , however , for cases where large modulation amplitudes are expected , or very precise results required , then some caution should be exercised in its use .      for the case of",
    "@xmath64 we can compute the distribution of best - fit amplitudes , @xmath4 , for a large number of simulations . from this distribution",
    "we can then estimate the value @xmath119 that has a 1% chance probability of being measured .",
    "this is just the familiar mda described above .",
    "figure 7 shows a comparison of the results from such simulations ( blue square symbols ) versus the analytic expression given above , @xmath120 ( solid line ) .",
    "we computed @xmath121 simulations for these results , and we used @xmath122 position angle bins for the modulation curves .",
    "figure 7 shows that the @xmath64 simulations are in good agreement with the analytic result , as we would expect in this case since as we showed above equation ( 7 ) is exact in the limit as @xmath64 .",
    "this gives us further confidence that our simulation procedures are correct .",
    "we can now explore a number of issues with regard to detection of polarization .",
    "for example , how many counts are needed to measure a modulation amplitude to a particular precision , and for a given precision in the amplitude measurement , how accurately can the position angle be measured ?    to address these questions we perform additional simulations using true distributions with specified amplitudes and position angles . for the illustrative examples below we used two different amplitudes , both with @xmath123 , however",
    ", we have explored many different cases and all the results summarized here are independent of the particular values of @xmath63 or @xmath23 used .",
    "the example distributions described below are ; @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "these examples correspond to intrinsic modulation amplitudes , @xmath63 , of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . for a specific detector",
    "these would correspond to polarization amplitudes , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "we emphasize that for these modest amplitudes use of equation ( 7 ) to describe the probability density should be a very good approximation .    to determine the number of counts , @xmath36 , needed to reach a polarization sensitivity given by the mdp value we require that mdp @xmath130 , and thus @xmath131 .",
    "note that here @xmath34 cancels out , and to achieve mdp values at these amplitudes requires @xmath132 , and @xmath133 counts , respectively .",
    "note that this may seem a trivial point , but it s important to keep the terminology as precise as possible . below we will compare the counts needed to reach a certain mdp , @xmath134 , and the counts needed to measure the same amplitude of polarization to a certain precision , @xmath36 . while @xmath36 and @xmath134 will individually depend on @xmath34 , the ratio , @xmath135 ,",
    "can not depend on @xmath34 , that is , it is independent of the detector system employed .    with @xmath74",
    "we compute for different values of @xmath36 a large number , @xmath75 , of realizations , to each of which is fitted the stokes distribution ( equation 4 ) to determine the best fit values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( and thus @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , and their @xmath11 uncertainties ( as illustrated in figure 2 ) .",
    "we thus simulate the distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for different @xmath36 .      here",
    "we present the results of our simulations in several ways .",
    "first , we used the results from @xmath136 realizations for different values of @xmath36 to find the mean values of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and their 68% confidence ranges .",
    "these are derived for each parameter independently of the other , that is , they are 1-dimensional ( single parameter ) ranges .",
    "for example , if one were interested in asking the question , is a source ( or population of sources ) polarized , without regard to the particular position angle of the electric vector , then the 1-d distribution would be appropriate .",
    "we explore the joint , 2-dimensional distributions below in  4.4 .",
    "figure 8 shows an example simulated distribution of measured amplitudes , @xmath4 , computed with @xmath137 events and @xmath138 ( with @xmath123 ) .",
    "the left panel shows the differential ( binned ) distribution , and the right panel shows the same results expressed as a cumulative distribution .",
    "we also computed similar distributions for the measured position angle , @xmath5 .",
    "procedurally we use the estimated cumulative distributions to identify the mean of each distribution ( ie .",
    ", for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , and the two values @xmath139 and @xmath140 that enclose 68% of the distribution .",
    "this then gives the @xmath11 uncertainty , @xmath141 ( we also compute the corresponding values for the @xmath5 distribution ) .",
    "we can then compute the quantity @xmath142 , which can be thought of as the  number of sigmas \" of the measurement .",
    "we now explore the behavior of several quantities as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "the first is the ratio @xmath135 ( see figure 9 ) , where @xmath36 is simply the number of events ( photons ) simulated ( ie .",
    "the number of observed counts in the modulation curve ) , and @xmath144 is just the number of counts that would be required to reach an mda equal to the true amplitude , @xmath63 .",
    "this ratio can be thought of as the additional observing time required to measure the true amplitude to a given significance compared to the time needed to reach an mda equivalent to the true amplitude .",
    "how might we expect this ratio to depend on @xmath2 ?",
    "from equation ( 10 ) and the fact that @xmath145 it is straightforward to show that @xmath146 ( there is strict equality in the limit of small @xmath4 ) .",
    "we can then substitute @xmath147 , and a little arithmetic then demonstrates that @xmath148 .",
    "the black diamond symbols in figure 9 show the results of simulations using the example distributions described above with @xmath136 for different values of @xmath36 , and that the expected @xmath149 dependence is a good match to the simulations .",
    "one can also present the results in a slightly different but complementary way . in the above simulations we have essentially carried out many simulated observations and computed the distribution of  observed \" values of the amplitude and position angle , but in reality an observer may not have the luxury of making such a large number of independent observations of a particular source .",
    "all any observer can do is to observe some number , @xmath36 , of photons from the source , construct a modulation curve and fit it as we have done in the simulations described above . from this procedure",
    "we obtain four quantities , @xmath4 , @xmath82 , @xmath5 , and @xmath83 .",
    "this constitutes a measurement of the polarization parameters , or more simply , a measurement of polarization . here",
    ", the uncertainties , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , are obtained for a specified confidence level and number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , for the @xmath11 ( 68.3% ) , single parameter confidence ranges we would find the change in each parameter that produces a @xmath150 ( while allowing the other parameter to vary in the fitting procedure ) . for a 2-dimensional , joint confidence region at the same level of confidence ( 68.3% ) we would find the @xmath151 contour in the @xmath4 - @xmath5 plane ( see , for example , lampton et al . 1976 ) .",
    "for the diamond symbols in figure 9 above we used the mean values and @xmath11 uncertainties derived from the distributions computed from many simulated observations to obtain @xmath143 , however , one can also use the  measured \" quantities from each simulated observation to compute @xmath152 .",
    "one can then plot the observed quantities for each simulated observation , where now @xmath153 is computed using the best - fit value for @xmath4 and the formula @xmath154 .",
    "we have done this and show the results in figure 9 with the colored symbols .",
    "that is , the colored points are these  measured \" values from individual simulations .",
    "the red symbols were computed with @xmath155 , @xmath138 , @xmath156 ( deg ) , the blue used @xmath157 , @xmath138 , @xmath156 ( deg ) , and the green with @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 ( deg ) .",
    "we see that the distribution of  measured \" points falls along the same relations as that deduced from the simulated distributions of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , as indeed they should since they are sampling the same distributions .",
    "this way of presenting the results of the simulations makes a more direct connection with actual polarimetric observations , as we only plot quantities that one would obtain directly from a single observation . to the extent that actual observations are dominated only by poisson counting noise and for which the background is small ,",
    "then they must fall along the relations followed by the simulated observations shown in figure 6 .",
    "indeed , the locus of points traced out by the `` measured '' values from individual simulations can be easily approximated by simply plotting curves that intersect the entire swarm of simulated points . doing this we find that @xmath161 ( lower dashed curve in figure 9 ) , which agrees with the result deduced above from equation 10 .",
    "we also explored simulations where the true amplitude @xmath63 was set equal to the mda .",
    "figure 10 shows the cumulative distribution of the  measured \" values of @xmath2 from several such simulations .",
    "one can see from figure 10 that roughly 60% of the time one would ",
    "measure \" the amplitude , @xmath4 , at the 3@xmath104 level , or better .",
    "we emphasize that this relation is based on the 1-d ( single parameter ) confidence range for @xmath4 , and would be appropriate only for the case of addressing the question of the detection of a significant modulation amplitude independent of the position angle .",
    "we now explore the joint , 2-dimensional confidence regions .      for a 2-dimensional confidence region",
    "we need to find the contour in the @xmath4 - @xmath5 plane that encloses a specified fraction of the best - fit pairs . for a @xmath11 region ( 68.3% confidence )",
    "this is the contour that satisfies @xmath162 , where @xmath163 .",
    "we again use the stokes decomposition and compute @xmath164 on grids of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 around the best - fit values , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "we can then convert the grids of stokes parameters into the appropriate values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and find the boundaries of the region that satisfies @xmath168 .",
    "we next find the maximum and minimum value on the boundary for each parameter .",
    "we can then define @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the maximum and minimum values on the contour of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "figure 11 shows a pair of @xmath11 confidence regions computed in this fashion .",
    "results from two simulations are shown , one with a lower amplitude , @xmath173 , and one with a higher amplitude , @xmath174 .",
    "both simulations were performed with @xmath175 deg ( these true parameters are marked by the red diamond symbols ) , and n = 10000 . in each case",
    "a modulation curve was randomly sampled using the true amplitude and position angle , and the simulated data were then fitted to determine the best - fit values of the amplitude and position angle .",
    "these points are shown by the green square symbols .",
    "the shaded areas show the regions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 around each best - fit pair that satisfy @xmath168 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical dotted lines mark the maximum and minimum values on the regions for each parameter .",
    "one can see that the size of the confidence region grows for smaller intrinsic modulation amplitudes ( as one would expect ) , and that the confidence regions are in general not circular .",
    "the fact that the best fit value ( green square symbol ) and @xmath11 contours did not enclose the `` true '' values ( red diamond symbol ) for the higher amplitude example was just the `` luck of the draw '' for this single realization .",
    "the probability distribution expressed earlier (  3 ) in equation ( 7 ) can also be used to derive an analytic expression for the 2-d confidence contour in the @xmath4 - @xmath5 plane for any desired level of confidence , as long as the intrinsic amplitude is not very large ( as is satisfied by the simulations just presented ) .",
    "this approach has been investigated by weisskopf et al .",
    "they derive a pair of parametric relations for the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 on any confidence contour ( see their equation 8) .",
    "these expressions predict the correct range ( extremes ) in the amplitude , @xmath4 , but overpredict the range in @xmath5 by a factor of 2 , apparently because their original derivation neglected a switch from phase angle to position angle ( weisskopf , private communication ) .",
    "thus , if one replaces all occurrences of @xmath5 , @xmath23 and @xmath176 with @xmath177 the respective angle ( eg . , @xmath178 ) beginning at their equation ( 6 ) , one obtains the following expressions ; @xmath179 and @xmath180 where @xmath181 , with @xmath182 and @xmath36 being the desired confidence level and number of detected photons , respectively , and @xmath176 is just a parametric angle that varies around the contour .",
    "the thick blue curves in figure 11 were drawn using these expressions with @xmath183 , @xmath184 ( ie . , @xmath11 ) , and the pair @xmath185 given by the appropriate best fit values ( green square symbols ) .",
    "these contour curves provide an excellent match to the boundaries of the shaded regions , as we would expect at these relatively low amplitudes for which equation ( 7 ) is a good approximation to the exact probability density .",
    "we can now compute the value @xmath186 for each particular simulation .",
    "this again quantifies the `` number of sigmas '' of the measurement , but now reflects the fact that it is a _ joint _ measurement of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 together .",
    "results from a number of such simulations are also shown in figure 9 , where we plot the same figure of merit , @xmath135 , as before , but now using @xmath187 .",
    "this curve is again quadratic in @xmath2 but rises more steeply than the 1d relation , because @xmath188 is larger than @xmath189 . in agreement with weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we find that the 2d relation is very well approximated as @xmath190 , and this is the dashed line running through the square symbols .    to further quantify the behavior as a function of amplitude we explored additional simulations with larger modulation amplitudes .",
    "an example of how the confidence contours defined by equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) ( which were derived from equation ( 7 ) ) over - predict the true size at large amplitudes is shown in figure 12 .",
    "the symbols have the same meanings as in figure 11 .",
    "this simulation had @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and was computed with @xmath193 events .",
    "the shaded region is again the joint @xmath11 confidence region satisfying @xmath168 , and the blue curve , which clearly over - predicts the confidence region , is from equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) . for completeness",
    "we also determined @xmath135 for several larger amplitude values .",
    "we find that for amplitudes @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "we also show in figure 13 the position angle uncertainty , @xmath83 in degrees ( at @xmath11 confidence ) as a function of @xmath187 .",
    "we find that this relation can be very well approximated as @xmath200 .",
    "the @xmath201 dependence can be seen starting with equation 11 . with @xmath202 and a bit of algebra one can show that @xmath203 . substituting for @xmath204 and replacing @xmath205",
    "we find that @xmath206 .",
    "a final substitution of @xmath207 shows that @xmath208 .",
    "since we previously demonstrated that @xmath209 scales like @xmath149 , this shows that @xmath210 .",
    "thus , a joint @xmath6 measurement constrains the position angle to better than 10 degrees .",
    "the mdp is a very commonly employed figure of merit to describe the polarization sensitivity of a detector system . in their recent paper weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have argued that  more counts would be needed \" to _ measure _ the polarization corresponding to the @xmath211 confidence mda rather than to just establish the same level . as we have shown",
    "this is correct in the sense of a `` polarization measurement '' being a joint measurement of both the amplitude @xmath4 and position angle @xmath5 .",
    "this seems sensible , since it adds an additional requirement , that the measured @xmath4 and @xmath5 both fall within a 2d confidence region .",
    "we have also shown that in the limit of small amplitudes the additional number of counts required is given by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "this factor decreases slowly with increasing intrinsic amplitude .",
    "for example , it has a value of @xmath212 when @xmath191 .",
    "however , if one were to ask a different question , and were interested in establishing simply that a source is polarized , with say , a @xmath6 measurement of the amplitude , @xmath4 , without concern for the position angle @xmath5 , then the 1d ( one interesting parameter ) case is appropriate , and no extra counts are needed to measure the mda .",
    "so , in some sense the answer one obtains depends on the question asked .",
    "the mdp value has often been used to estimate observing times required to reach particular sensitivity levels .",
    "the results shown here demonstrate that exposure requests should clearly match the measurement goals of the desired scientific program .",
    "for example , if source modeling requires a joint measurement of both polarization parameters , then the appropriate time to reach a required precision for two interesting parameters should be requested .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jean swank , keith jahoda , kevin black , joe hill , craig markwardt , phil kaaret and charles montgomery for helpful discussions related to x - ray polarization measurements and instrumentation .",
    "we also thank martin weisskopf , ronald elsner and stephen odell for reviewing an earlier version of this manuscript , and much helpful feedback on the question of measuring polarization in the x - ray band .",
    "finally , we thank the anonymous referee for their careful review which helped us improve this paper ."
