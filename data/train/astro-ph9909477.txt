    "an important advantage over gas phase studies is that the column density can be straightforwardly derived from the observed integrated optical depth and the intrinsic band strength determined in the laboratory .",
    "in contrast , for gas phase species excitation , and radiative transfer models are required .",
    "previous ( gas phase c@xmath27o , h@xmath11co ) studies have shown that the @xmath12 ratio increases with galacto - centric radius , with @xmath12=25 in the galactic center , and @xmath28c/@xmath29c = 77 in the local interstellar medium ( see wilson & rood @xcite for an overview ) .",

    "the spectra were reduced with version 6 of the sws pipeline during january ",
    "april 1998 at sron groningen , using the latest calibration files available at that time .",
    "for some low flux spectra we applied a `` pulse shape '' correction on erd level ( de graauw et al .",
    "@xcite ) to linearize the slopes , resulting in @xmath1410% better signal - to - noise .",
    "all detector scans were checked for excessive noise levels , deviating flux levels and continuum slopes , and dark current jumps .",
    "bad scans were taken out off the data , and then the scans were `` flat - fielded '' to the median spectrum using a first order polynomial .",
    "cosmic ray hits were removed by clipping all points deviating more than 3  @xmath37 from the median , and subsequently the scans were averaged and re - binned per scan direction to a resolving power of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 for gl  989 ) . the effective `` signal - to - noise '' values , as determined from the systematic differences between the sws up and down scans , are given in table  [ t_obs ] .",
    "we note that due to the weakness of the interstellar @xmath0 band , @xmath40% of the continuum , our analysis ( column densities , band profiles ) is not significantly affected by detector memory effects , known to exist at this wavelength . also , the detector response function is very smooth over the narrow @xmath0 band , and thus will not induce spurious features due to small wavelength calibration errors or dark current uncertainties .",
    "an accurate wavelength calibration is important for our study .",
    "the standard sws wavelength calibration was applied ( valentijn et al .",
    "the satellite velocity was converted to the heliocentric reference frame , using standard iso  sws pipeline routines .",
    "then we corrected for the source velocity in the heliocentric frame , using published radial velocities for each source ( table  [ t_obs ] ) .",
    "recent millimeter observations of c@xmath41o emission lines show velocity shifts that are in excellent agreement with the values that we use ( van der tak et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . to check the accuracy of the wavelength calibration and velocity corrections , we compared the position of ro - vibrational @xmath42 gas phase lines ( @xmath43 lines are too weak ) , when present in the same spectrum , with peak positions from the hitran database ( rothman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for s  140  :  irs1 , and w  3  :  irs5 the lines are blue - shifted by 10% of a resolution element ( @xmath140.15  @xmath44 ; @xmath1420",
    "@xmath20 ) compared to the hitran wavelengths , for gl  2591 by 20% , and for gl  2136 by 30% .",
    "part of this blue - shift may be real .",
    "mitchell et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find that , whereas the velocity shift of @xmath45 lines is in good agreement with millimeter studies , the @xmath42 absorption lines show significant blue shifted shoulders and sub - peaks , originating from the outflow associated with the protostar . at the much lower resolution of our observations ( @xmath14160  @xmath20 ) , this may result in a blue shift of the @xmath42 absorption line .",
    "however , the main absorption is present at the cloud velocity , and at our resolution the peak would shift by not more than @xmath46  @xmath47 ( gl  2591 ) , @xmath48  @xmath20 ( w  3  :  irs5 ) or much less than that for the other sources .",
    "thus , we attribute the co line shifts in the iso  sws spectra primarily to uncertainties in the wavelength calibration and small pointing errors . in particular , gl  2136 was observed at the end of the iso mission for which no updated wavelength calibration files are available yet .",
    "we applied the small shift derived from the co lines to further improve the wavelength calibration of the @xmath0 band . for one object ,",

    "thermal processing is thus an important process in interstellar space , at least toward luminous protostars .",
    "the differences in the various lines of sight are intriguing , and may indicate an evolutionary sequence with increasing thermal processing . perhaps several distinct layers exist around massive protostars , in a way sketched in ehrenfreund et al .",

    "the temperatures of the least ( w  33a ; @xmath116=115  k ) and most ( s  140 ; @xmath116=118  k ) evolved luminous objects are extremely well constrained in an interval of only 3  k. at the long time scales in interstellar space , this small temperature difference can be translated to a difference in heating time at the amorphous - crystalline phase transformation ( segregation ) temperature .",
    "amorphous ice has a highly disordered structure , characterized by a broad distribution of bond angles between neighboring @xmath1 molecules ( madden et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast ,",
    "crystalline ice has well defined bond angles .",

    "as the temperature increases ( to @xmath118  k ) , the higher barriers can be scaled as well .",
    "hence , this temperature range implies a variation in barrier height by about 3% , with a typical height of @xmath119=4600  k ( calculated from a 5500  k barrier at 140  k for pure ice ; tielens & allamandola @xcite ) . in interstellar space , rather than temperature",

    "h bending mode vibration frequency ( tielens & allamandola @xcite ) .",
    "as the protostar is formed , it heats the surrounding molecular cloud , creating a hot core region around it where the ice evaporates .",
    "immediately surrounding this region is a zone where the ice has been warmed sufficiently to start the amorphous- crystalline phase transformation , corresponding to the @xmath117  k case in the laboratory . as time progresses , this phase transformation progresses as well , and in essence , although the temperature does not change , the interstellar ice corresponds to warmer and warmer ( i.e. 115118  k ) laboratory experiments . at the typical time scale of evolution for hot core regions of @xmath1233  10@xmath124 years ( charnley et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the laboratory temperature range of 115118  k effectively corresponds to a segregation temperature of @xmath1477  k ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "thus , at this temperature , w  33a and ngc  7538  :  irs9 would have the youngest and least evolved hot cores , while s  140 and gl  2591 are @xmath125 years older and have succeeded to heat the surrounding gas and ice significantly . however , the derivation of a heating time scale is complicated by the presence of temperature gradients , and possible intrinsic differences between the sources .",
    "it seems thus likely that both time and temperature effects play a role in the evolution of interstellar @xmath6 ices .",
    "detailed modeling of the temperature and density structure around massive protostars is needed to derive evolutionary time scales ( e.g. van der tak et al .",

    "interstellar @xmath6 may form on grain surfaces , through the reaction of atomic o with co , atomic c , or c@xmath126 , accreted from the gas phase . although co , rather than c or c@xmath126 , is generally assumed to be the origin species , solid and gas phase isotope @xmath12  ratios provide a good test for this ( sect .",

    "the ice composition provides a measure for the gas phase abundances during accretion , convolved with reaction efficiencies .",
    "the ratio of @xmath51/@xmath6 is a measure for hydrogenation over oxidation reactions of co. the @xmath54 profile provides an upper limit @xmath2/@xmath6@xmath821 in the ice , and thus oxidation of co is at least as efficient as hydrogenation , despite the much larger atomic h abundance compared to atomic o. at the same time , the solid @xmath1/@xmath6 ratio measures the gas phase ( o+o@xmath11)/co ratio at accretion , since @xmath1 is formed from o@xmath11 or o@xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath54 profile does not significantly constrain the solid @xmath1/@xmath6 ratio , it could be as high as the ratio of column densities , i.e. @xmath1/@xmath5@xmath825 ( gerakines et al .",

    "@xcite ; boogert @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the prominent red wing in the bending mode is a signature for the presence of @xmath6:@xmath2 clusters in interstellar ices .",
    "an alternative way to form interstellar @xmath6 is through irradiation of co containing ices by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons . even in `` cold '' sight - lines such as elias  16",

    "@xcite ) .      the derived @xmath0 , and published @xmath16 , column densities were used to calculate @xmath12 abundance ratios ( table  [ t_crat ] ) .",

    "previously , gas phase molecules were used for this purpose , using uv , optical , and radio observations ( see wilson & rood @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "c@xmath27o and h@xmath11co observations yield an increasing @xmath12 ratio with galacto - centric radius ( langer & penzias @xcite ) .",
    "this can be understood by the different origin of @xmath58c and @xmath128c atoms .",
    "the @xmath58c is rapidly produced by helium burning in massive stars , and injected into the interstellar medium by supernovae . in later stellar generations , @xmath58c seeds are converted to @xmath128c in the cno cycle of low- and intermediate - mass stars , during their red giant phase .",
    "this is a much slower process .",
    "thus , the @xmath12 ratio is a measure for the enrichment of the interstellar medium by primary to secondary stellar processes .",
    "the observed gradient in the galactic @xmath12 ratio can then be understood by a higher star formation rate in the inner parts of the galaxy ( tosi @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath12 ratio derived from solid @xmath6 indicate the same trend as found in gas phase studies ( table  [ t_crat ] ; fig .  [ plot_c12c13 ] ) .",
    "low values are found near the galactic center ( @xmath8/@xmath34=52@xmath12911 ; gc  3 ) and in the molecular ring , at @xmath144  kpc from the galactic center ( w  33a ; 53@xmath1298 ) .",

    "thus , the evidence for a gradient in the @xmath12 ratio derived from solid @xmath6 is weak . within the ( rather large ) error bars ,",
    "this gradient is comparable to the h@xmath11co ( 6.6@xmath1292.0 ) and co data ( 7.5@xmath1291.2 ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that a limitation of our analysis is the lack of solid @xmath6 observations at low galactic radii ( 36  kpc ) .",
    "we note that also in gas phase studies ( wilson & rood @xcite ) , there is considerable scatter in the @xmath12 ratio , and no clear trend at galactic radii @xmath131  kpc is present either ( fig .  [ plot_c12c13 ] ) .",
    "( 244,205)(0,0 )    although the gradients agree well for @xmath6 , co , and h@xmath11co , we find that @xmath12 ratios derived from co ( abscissa @xmath1327.5 in eq .  2 )",
    "are systematically somewhat smaller .",
    "a comparison of the gas and solid state @xmath12 ratios for individual objects is possible for only 4 sources .",
    "for all of these , our solid @xmath6 observations yield higher @xmath7 ratios compared to gas phase co observations ( table  [ t_crat ] ) . however , for both the overall linear fit ( eq .  2 ) and for these individual sources , the differences are statistically small ( @xmath133 ) . for a proper interpretation of these possible differences",
    "it is important to note that the gas phase observations were done several arcminutes away from our @xmath6 observations ( table  [ t_crat ] ) . in the gas phase ,",
    "considerable variations of the @xmath12 ratio were reported within the same region , such as within the w  33 cloud ( langer & penzias @xcite ) and toward the supernova remnant cas  a ( wilson & rood @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , comparison of our @xmath8/@xmath0 ratio toward the galactic center object gc  3 with the gas phase determination toward the galactic center supernova remnant sgr  b2 is complicated by the quite different stellar evolution history that these regions may have .",
    "finally , we determined that @xmath8/@xmath34=69@xmath12915 ( @xmath134 ) for the local ism , by taking an unweighted mean for the three objects located in the @xmath135  ophiuchi , and corona australis clouds .",
    "we excluded elias  16 from this mean , since it has a much larger error bar than the other sources ( table  [ t_crat ] ) .",

    "the value for the local ism ( @xmath8/@xmath34= 69@xmath12915 ) is in reasonable agreement with gas phase studies .",
    "these results could have important implications for our knowledge of interstellar chemistry .",
    "both gaseous co and h@xmath11co may have been affected by chemical fractionation and isotope selective destruction ( e.g. langer et al .",
    "@xcite ; tielens @xcite ) .",
    "if fractionation is an important mechanism , preferential incorporation of @xmath138 in co , leads to low @xmath139 and high @xmath140 ratios . on the other hand ,",
    "if isotope selective destruction dominates over fractionation , @xmath43 is preferentially destroyed , leading to high @xmath139 and low @xmath141 ratios .",
    "carbonaceous molecules derived from c@xmath30 or c would then have high or low @xmath12 ratios , depending on the dominant process and chemical pathway .",
    "our lines of sight trace dense molecular clouds , and co is the main reservoir of c. then , fractionation or selective destruction will highly influence the @xmath142 ratio , but will hardly affect the @xmath143 ratio .",
    "the generally higher h@xmath144co/ h@xmath145co ratios compared to co thus suggest that h@xmath11co originates from c@xmath30 ( tielens @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , if indeed the @xmath8/@xmath0 ratios are higher compared to co , this would imply that @xmath6 is formed from c@xmath30 rather than c or , as is generally assumed , from co ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "however , we must emphasize that with the present large uncertainties in the @xmath12 ratios we can not make strong statements about the chemical pathway to form interstellar @xmath6 .",
    "we expect that with future improvements of the iso  sws data reduction , the large error bars in the @xmath6 abundances for some sources ( gl  989 , ngc  2024  :  irs2 , and w  3  :  irs5 ) can be reduced . furthermore , it is important to obtain @xmath28co/@xmath29co ratios in the same line of sight as our @xmath5 observations , preferably by absorption line studies along a pencil beam .",
    "observations of the solid @xmath28co/@xmath29co ratio would be particularly useful .",
    "this will also shed light on the origin of the large scatter seen in the @xmath12 ratio as a function of galacto - centric radius for both solid @xmath6 ( i.e. note the particularly high value for gl  2136 in fig .",
    "[ plot_c12c13 ] ) and gas phase species .",
    "it has been suggested that perhaps most of this scatter is real , and can be attributed to local variations in the star formation history ( wilson & rood @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented iso  sws observations of the stretching mode of @xmath0 ice in the spectral range 22552300 @xmath3 ( 4.344.43  @xmath15 ) in 13 galactic lines of sight .",
    "all sight - lines show an absorption feature with a peak position in the range 22762280  @xmath3 , and a gaussian fwhm of typically 6 - 9  @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , the four high - mass protostars gl  2136 , s  140  :  irs1 , gl  2591 , and w  3  :  irs5 , show a narrow ( fwhm@xmath143  @xmath3 ) absorption line at @xmath146  @xmath44 .",
    "this feature is much weaker or absent toward other high - mass objects ( w  33a , ngc  7538  :  irs9 ) , toward low - mass protostars , the galactic center ( gc  3 ) , and quiescent molecular cloud material ( elias  16 ) .",
    "these observational results are compared to laboratory experiments of the stretching mode of @xmath0 ice .",
    "we conclude that this band is a sensitive probe of the heating history and composition of interstellar ice mantles .",
    "the profile of the interstellar band can be fitted in two different ways .",
    "first , the detected broad and narrow components could originate from ices with different heating histories and perhaps composition along the line of sight . in this scenario ,",
    "the detected broad component is ascribed to a non - heated mixture of @xmath5 with polar molecules such as most likely @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the mixing ratio of @xmath2/@xmath6 in the ice can generally be constrained to an upper limit of @xmath51/@xmath6@xmath821 , in agreement with the observed column densities along the lines of sight .",
    "the narrow 2282  @xmath3 absorption feature detected toward several high - mass protostars is ascribed to @xmath0 in a polar @xmath6 ice that has been heated to temperatures of at least 50  k ( in interstellar space ) . in such an ice ,",
    "the bondings of the @xmath6 , and polar molecules are segregated and the @xmath6 band profiles resemble those in a pure @xmath6 ice . to fit the exact peak position of the 2282  @xmath3 feature , the @xmath6 ice must contain at least some @xmath2 ( @xmath2/@xmath6@xmath147 ) .",
    "a second way to fit the @xmath0 band , is with a single ice at a specific temperature .",
    "this would locate the ice in a well confined region around the protostar , rather than in regions of different temperature as for the two component model .",
    "for the luminous protostars showing evidence for this narrow component , the best fitting laboratory ices have temperatures within a very small interval of @xmath69  k ( using @xmath1:@xmath2:@xmath5=1:1:1 ) . at the long time scales in interstellar space",
    ", this laboratory temperature interval corresponds to a heating time difference between the luminous protostars comparable to the lifetime of hot cores ( @xmath143  10@xmath124 years ) at an amorphous - crystalline phase transition temperature of @xmath1477  k. however , the derivation of heating time scales likely is complicated by the presence of temperature gradients , and possible intrinsic differences between the sources , such as different temperature and density structure .    to further test the hypothesis that interstellar @xmath6 ice is affected by heating",
    ", we calculate the ratio , and upper limits , of the narrow to broad @xmath0 component peak depths .",
    "this quantity is compared to known physical parameters of all objects .",
    "we conclude that the strength of the narrow @xmath0 substructure correlates with the dust and co gas temperature along the line of sight , and anti - correlates with the ice abundances .",
    "this is further good evidence that the structure of ices around luminous protostars is affected by thermal processing , as concluded from the laboratory fits .",
    "this effect appears to be not important for low mass protostars and the quiescent medium .",
    "although we have to keep in mind that our selection of low mass objects is small , this might imply that unaltered interstellar ices are included in comets .",
    "finally , we have determined solid @xmath0 column densities .",
    "these were used to derive @xmath12 ratios in all 13 sight - lines .",
    "it is the first time that the galactic @xmath7 ratio is determined from the solid state .",
    "solid state determinations of the @xmath12 ratio are more reliable than gas phase studies , because the column density can be determined without uncertain radiative transfer effects . like in gas phase studies ,",
    "we find low values for the galactic center ( gc  3 ; @xmath52/@xmath0 = 52@xmath12911 ) and the galactic molecular ring ( w  33a ; 53@xmath1298 ) , and higher values at larger galacto - centric radii .",
    "the gradient of the @xmath8/@xmath34 ratio as a function of galacto - centric radius ( 4.5@xmath1292.2  kpc@xmath73 ) agrees with gas phase studies .",
    "the scatter in this relation is however large , and may perhaps indicate local differences in star formation history , since @xmath31 is converted to @xmath32 in low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "comparison of solid and gas phase isotope ratios can be used to trace the chemical history of molecules . in general , the @xmath8/@xmath34 ratio , as for h@xmath11co , tends to be larger compared to co studies ( @xmath148 difference ) . in the dense molecular clouds that we have observed , where co is likely unaffected by fractionation or isotope - selective destruction , this would imply that interstellar @xmath6 is formed from c@xmath30 , rather than co or c. however , to draw definite conclusions on interstellar chemistry and on global and local variations in the galactic star formation history , we emphasize that a systematic determination of the @xmath12 ratio from atomic c@xmath149 , co , and solid @xmath6 in individual lines of sight is needed . at present , there is little overlap between our solid @xmath6 observations and published gas phase observations .",
