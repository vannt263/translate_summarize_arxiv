    "the kondo effect observed in semiconductor quantum dots has attracted a lot of interest.@xcite in a quantum dot , the number of electrons @xmath8 is fixed by the coulomb blockade to integer values and can be tuned by the gate voltage .",
    "usually the discrete spin - degenerate levels in the quantum dot are consecutively occupied , and the total spin is zero or 1/2 for an even and odd number of electrons , respectively .",
    "the kondo effect takes place only in the latter case .",
    "the spin @xmath9 in the dot is coupled to the fermi sea in external leads through tunnel barriers , which results in the formation of the kondo resonant state at the fermi level.@xcite the conductance through the dot is enhanced to a value of the order of @xmath10 at low temperatures of @xmath11 ( kondo temperature).@xcite this is called unitary limit .",
    "when @xmath8 is even , there is no localized spin and thus the kondo effect is not relevant .",
    "recently sasaki _ et al_.  has found a large kondo effect in so - called `` vertical '' quantum dots with an even @xmath8.@xcite the spacing of discrete levels in such dots is comparable with the strength of electron - electron coulomb interaction . hence the electronic states deviate from the simple picture mentioned above.@xcite if two electrons are put into nearly degenerate levels , the exchange interaction favors a spin triplet ( hund s rule).@xcite this state is changed to a spin singlet by applying a magnetic field which increases the level spacing .",
    "hence the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states , @xmath1 , can be controlled experimentally by the magnetic field .",
    "the kondo effect is significantly enhanced around the degeneracy point between the triplet and singlet states , @xmath4 .",
    "tuning of the energy difference between the spin states is hardly possible in traditional kondo systems of dilute magnetic impurities in metal and thus this situation is quite unique to the quantum dot systems .",
    "the kondo effect in multilevel quantum dots has been investigated theoretically by several groups.@xcite they have shown that the contribution from multilevels enhances the kondo effect . in our previous paper,@xcite",
    "we have considered the experimental situation by sasaki _",
    "et al_.  in which the spin - singlet and triplet states are almost degenerate .",
    "we have calculated the kondo temperature @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 , using the poor man s scaling method.@xcite we have shown that @xmath12 is maximal around @xmath4 and decreases with increasing @xmath1 obeying a power law , @xmath13 .",
    "the exponent @xmath14 is not universal but depends on a ratio of the initial coupling constants .",
    "our results indicate that the kondo effect is enhanced by the competition between singlet and triplet states , in agreement with the experimental findings.@xcite    we have disregarded the zeeman splitting of the spin - triplet state , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is @xmath17-component of the total spin @xmath18 ) , since this is a small energy scale in the experimental situation , @xmath3.@xcite pustilnik _ et al_.  and giuliano _",
    "et al_.have studied another situation where the zeeman effect is relevant , @xmath5.@xcite usually the zeeman effect lifts off the degeneracy of the spin states and , as a result , breaks the kondo effect .",
    "they have found that the kondo effect can arise from extra degeneracy between one of the components of the spin - triplet state , @xmath19 , and a singlet state , @xmath20 , if the value of @xmath1 is tuned to fulfill that @xmath21 .",
    "their mechanism might explain some other experimental results of the kondo effect in quantum dots under high magnetic fields.@xcite    the purpose of the present paper is to construct a general theory for the enhancement of the kondo effect in quantum dots with an even number of electrons , for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we adopt the poor man s scaling method along with the mean field theory .",
    "it is well known that the characteristic energy scale of the kondo physics , the kondo temperature @xmath0 , is determined by all the energies from @xmath0 up to the upper cutoff.@xcite by the scaling method , we can evaluate @xmath0 ( its exponential part at least ) by taking all the energies properly.@xcite when @xmath2 is negligible , the energies from @xmath1 to the upper cutoff would feel fourfold degeneracy of the dot states , @xmath22 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath20 , which enhances the kondo temperature . with increasing @xmath1 , @xmath0 decreases by a power law.@xcite we extend our previous calculations to the case of @xmath23 which has been discussed by pustilnik _",
    "et al_.@xcite and giuliano _",
    "et al_.@xcite we take into account the energies not only from @xmath0 to @xmath2 , where only two degenerate states @xmath24 and @xmath20 are relevant , but also from @xmath2 to the upper cutoff , where the dot states seem fourfold degenerate .",
    "the latter energy region has been neglected in refs .   and .",
    "in consequence we find a power law dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2 again .",
    "the mean field theory of the kondo effect was pioneered by yoshimori and sakurai@xcite and is commonly used for the kondo lattice model.@xcite it is useful to capture main qualitative features of the kondo effect ; renormalizability at the scale of @xmath0 , resonances at the fermi level , and resonant transmission . the simplicity and universality of the mean field theory have driven us to apply it to the problem in question .",
    "generally the kondo effect gives rise to a many - body ground state which consists of the dot states @xmath25 and the conduction electrons @xmath26 .",
    "the total spin of this ground state is less than the original spin @xmath27 localized in the dot .",
    "the binding energy is of the order of the kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we take into account the spin couplings between the dot states and conduction electrons , @xmath28 , by the mean field , neglecting their fluctuations.@xcite these spin couplings give rise to resonant states around the fermi level @xmath29 with the width of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "the conduction electrons can be transported through the resonant levels , which yields the unitary limit of the conductance @xmath30 . for our study ,",
    "the mean field calculations have the following advantages .",
    "( i ) the enhancement of @xmath0 by the competition between the singlet and triplet states can be directly understood in terms of the overlap between their kondo resonant states .",
    "( ii ) the power law dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 or @xmath2 is obtained , which is in accordance with the calculated results by the scaling method .",
    "( iii ) the mean field calculations are applicable to the intermediate regions where two of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , are of the same order .",
    "the poor man s scaling method hardly gives any results in these regions .",
    "hence we can examine the whole parameter region of @xmath1 and @xmath2 by the mean field theory .",
    "the disadvantage of the mean field calculations is that they only give qualitative answers.@xcite hence the mean field theory and scaling method are complementary to each other for understanding the kondo effect .",
    "we shall discuss the relation of our approach to the renormalization group analysis of the multilevel kondo effect.@xcite our model effectively reduces to the one with two channels in the leads and spin - triplet ( and singlet ) state in the dot .",
    "the ground state of this model would be believed to be a spin singlet , which corresponds to the full screening of the dot spin .",
    "the poor man s scaling approach and our mean field theory , however , show a tendency to the formation of the underscreened kondo ground state with spin @xmath9 .",
    "we should mention that the exact ground state can not be determined within the limits of the applicability of these approaches .",
    "pustilnik and glazman have recently proposed a different model for the `` triplet - singlet kondo effect.''@xcite in our notations , they set @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlet ] ) for the singlet state .",
    "their model can be directly mapped onto a special case of the two - impurity kondo model,@xcite for which the ground state is a spin singlet .",
    "we are concerned about the case of @xmath32 , and we find that the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath34 reduces as a result of the renormalization.@xcite this suggests that the case considered in ref .",
    "is by no means a generic one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our model is presented in the next section . in section iii , we rederive @xmath12 when the zeeman splitting is irrelevant , using the poor man s scaling method , in a simpler form than our previous work.@xcite then we extend our calculations to the case of @xmath23 .",
    "the section iv is devoted to the mean field theory for the kondo effect in quantum dots .",
    "first we explain this theory for the usual kondo effect in a quantum dot with @xmath35 .",
    "then we apply the mean field scheme to our model with an even number of electrons in the dot .",
    "the conclusions and discussion are given in the last section .",
    "we are interested in the competition between the spin - singlet and triplet states in a quantum dot .",
    "to model the situation , it is sufficient to consider two extra electrons in a quantum dot at the background of a singlet state of all other @xmath36 electrons , which we will regard as the vacuum @xmath37 .",
    "these two extra electrons occupy two levels of different orbital symmetry.@xcite the energies of the levels are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "possible two - electron states are ( i ) the spin - triplet state , ( ii ) the spin - singlet state of the same orbital symmetry as the triplet state , @xmath40 , and ( iii ) two singlet states of different orbital symmetry , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . among the singlet states ,",
    "we only consider a state of the lowest energy , which belongs to the group ( iii ) .",
    "thus we restrict our attention to four states , @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 creates an electron with spin @xmath46 in level @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficients in the singlet state , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( @xmath48 ) , are determined by the electron - electron interaction and one - electron level spacing @xmath49 .",
    "we set @xmath50 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath51.@xcite although @xmath52 in general , the scaling analysis shows that the kondo temperature is the same as that in the case of @xmath50 , apart from a prefactor.@xcite the energies of the triplet state are given by @xmath53 and the energy of the singlet state is denoted by @xmath54 .",

    "the tunneling between the dot and the leads is written as @xmath66 we assume that the orbital symmetry is conserved in the tunneling processes.@xcite to avoid the complication due to the fact that there are two leads @xmath67 , we perform a unitary transformation for electron modes in the leads along the lines of ref .  ;",
