    "bodies in our solar system show a distribution of water abundance .",
    "the innermost terrestrial planets contain little water compared with the outer planets .",
    "planet formation is thought to occur from planetesimals that formed in the solar nebula . within the solar nebula , ice forms beyond a radius from the central star known as the snow line , @xmath2 .",
    "this is thought to play an important role in the composition of forming planets .",
    "the solid mass density outside the snow line is much higher because of water ice condensation .",
    "in fact , for a solar composition , water ice abundance is as high as silicate and iron ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observations of the asteroid belt , located between mars and jupiter , suggest that the snow line is currently located within this region .",
    "the outer asteroids are icy c - class objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the inner asteroid belt is largely devoid of water .",
    "this implies that when planetesimal formation occurred the snow line was located at around @xmath3 from the sun .",
    "the snow line occurs at a temperature , @xmath4 , that is in the range of @xmath5 @xcite to @xmath6 @xcite , depending on the partial pressure of nebular water vapour .",
    "its distance from the star is usually calculated in a fully turbulent steady state accretion disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is thought to drive the turbulence in the disc @xcite and thus transport angular momentum outwards allowing accretion on to the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent calculations have used a detailed disc structure and include a stellar radiation flux and viscous dissipation of the gas as the main heating sources .",
    "the disc is assumed to be in a quasi - steady state as the infall accretion rate decreases in time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the radius of the snow line reaches a minimum of about @xmath7 , inside the current orbit of the earth and this was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the snow line migrates inwards as the accretion rate drops ( down to an accretion rate of around @xmath8 ) because the viscous dissipation decreases .",
    "however , as the accretion rate drops below @xmath9 , the snow line migrates outwards again as the disc becomes optically thin and the temperature rises .",
    "the fully turbulent steady state model predicts a minimum snow line radius within the earth s orbit . if planetesimals formed during this time , the earth would have formed from icy bodies .",
    "this appears to be contradictory with the current water content on earth that is very low at around @xmath10 by weight @xcite .",
    "for comparison , the outer solar system planets have a mass fraction of water of greater than @xmath11 .",
    "the terrestrial planets in our solar system are thought to have formed from water - devoid planetesimals .",
    "hence the planetesimals must have formed either before the snow line moved inward or after the snow line moved outward past the earth s orbit .",
    "@xcite included ice opacity as well as the silicate opacity and find similar results to @xcite .",
    "they find that there is a deficit of solid mass at the later times and formation of water - devoid planetesimals is impossible .",
    "it is improbable for the planetesimals to form before the snow line moves inwards because the timescale involved is very short .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility that the earth formed from sublimating icy planetesimals after the snow line moved outwards .",
    "however , the extremely low observed water content on earth appears to be an unlikely outcome , because of the competition between sublimation and collision of the planetesimals . in this paper",
    "we attempt to address the inconsistency between the theoretical models for the snow line evolution and the observations of the solar system .",
    "protoplanetary discs may have a region of low turbulence at the disc mid - plane",
    ". the mri drives turbulence but may be suppressed by a low ionisation fraction @xcite .",
    "the inner parts of the disc are hot enough to be thermally ionised but farther away from the central star , cosmic rays are the dominant source of ionisation and these can only penetrate the surface layers .",
    "the mid - plane layer , the dead zone , has no turbulence .",
    "a variation of the turbulence with height from the mid - plane has been considered in some previous snow line models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the mid - plane layer had a sufficiently large viscosity that a steady disc was still achieved .",
    "@xcite consider the vertical structure of a layered disc and find that the location of the snow line is a little more ambiguous with the vertical stratification .",
    "the upper layers of the disc have a cooler temperature and so the snow line is closer to the star in the surfaces than at the mid - plane . for an accretion rate of @xmath12",
    "they predict a snow line radius of around @xmath1 .",
    "this is similar to that found by @xcite and @xcite for the fully turbulent disc model .",
    "if there is no turbulence within the dead zone , the disc can not be in a steady state and it is this possibility that we consider here .",
    "material accumulates in the dead zone which can then become gravitationally unstable .",
    "while the infall accretion rate is high , this can lead to the gravo - magneto disc instability .",
    "the disc spends the majority of the time with a dead zone in a quiescent state with a low accretion rate on to the star . however , the extra turbulence driven by the gravitational instability in the dead zone increases the disc temperature until the mri is triggered .",
    "this causes a large accretion outburst on to the star that is thought to explain fu orionis outbursts @xcite . at later times ,",
    "when the infall accretion rate drops , there is not sufficient material in the disc for the gravo - magneto instability to operate but a dead zone may still be present @xcite .",
    "given this rather different ( from a steady - state disc ) configuration and behaviour , in this paper , we consider the evolution of the snow line in a time dependent disc model that includes a dead zone .",
    "the material in an accretion disc orbits the central mass , @xmath13 , with a keplerian velocity at radius @xmath14 with angular velocity @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we use a one dimensional layered disc model described in @xcite and further developed in @xcite to evolve the total surface density , @xmath16 and mid - plane temperature , @xmath17 . we take a solar mass star , @xmath18 , with a disc that extends from a radius of @xmath19 up to @xmath20 .",
    "turbulence is driven by the mri in some regions of the disc and we parametrise this viscosity with a @xcite @xmath21 parameter that we take to be @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although there is still some uncertainty in this value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the disc consists of a turbulent surface layer of surface density , @xmath23 and temperature @xmath24 .",
    "where it exists , the dead zone has surface density @xmath25 .",
    "the extent of the dead zone in the disc is determined by a critical magnetic reynolds number , @xmath26 .",
    "we use the analytical approximations for the surface density in the turbulent layer given in equations  26 and  27 of @xcite .",
    "the innermost parts of the disc are externally heated by a flux of radiation from the central star ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we take the temperature of the star @xmath27 and its radius to be @xmath28 .",
    "we consider a model for the collapse of a molecular cloud on to the disc @xcite .",
    "initially the accretion rate is @xmath29 and this decays exponentially on a timescale of @xmath30 .",
    "material is added to the disc at a radius of @xmath31 .",
    "the dead zone can become self gravitating when the toomre parameter @xcite is sufficiently small , @xmath32 .",
    "we approximate the radius of the snow line to be where the temperature of the disc is @xmath33 .",
    "the disc models of @xcite suggest that this is a good approximation for varying disc mass and opacity .         in fig .",
    "[ sl ] we show the evolution of the snow line in two model discs , one that is fully turbulent ( or equivalently @xmath34 ) and one that has a dead zone determined by a critical magnetic reynolds number of @xmath35 .",
    "the fully turbulent model shows a monotonic decrease of the snow line radius in time so that at late times the snow line is within the radius of the earth s orbit at @xmath1 . we do not obtain the increase of the snow line radius at smaller accretion rates shown by @xcite because there is sufficient mass in the disc that the model remains optically thick at the radius where the snow line occurs .",
    "for example , at a time of @xmath36 , the infall accretion rate on to the disc has dropped to less than @xmath37 but the accretion on to the star is @xmath38 .",
    "the disc does not remain in a quasi - steady state as the accretion rate decreases as assumed in previous models .    for the model with @xmath39",
    ", initially there is no dead zone and the disc evolution proceeds as for the case with @xmath40 . as the infall accretion rate drops , the disc cools and a dead zone forms in the protoplanetary disc .",
    "the inner parts of the disc remain hot because they are heated by the radiation from the central star . within the dead zone , an icy region exists .",
    "the outer parts of the dead zone become self gravitating and this drives a small amount of turbulence that heats the disc above the snow line temperature ( see the sketch of the two disc models in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "the very brief periods of time during which there is no inner icy region are when the disc is in outburst .",
    "self gravity heats the disc sufficiently to trigger the mri within the dead zone .",
    "the temperature of the disc increases significantly and there is an fu orionis type outburst where the accretion rate on to the star increases by several orders of magnitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as with the fully turbulent disc ,",
    "the outermost parts of the disc are cool and icy . at late times",
    "the outer icy region reaches a minimum radius of about @xmath41 , roughly consistent with current observations . in our solar system ,",
    "the earth and other terrestrial planets likely formed after the inner icy region passed inside their radius because they are water devoid .",
    "this means that the earth must have formed after a time of about @xmath0 . at this time",
    ", there is little infall accretion on to the disc but there is a significant amount of mass in the disc , a total of about @xmath42 .",
    "the surface density at @xmath43 is high at @xmath44 .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard minimum mass solar nebular at this radius of about @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is comparable to the model of @xcite based on the nice model of planet formation that predicts a surface density of @xmath46 at the radius of the earth s orbit . at this time",
    "there was still sufficient mass in the disc for planetesimal and earth mass planet formation from the water - devoid disc .",
    "our simplified model clearly contains a number of uncertainties . note that because we took the upper value for @xmath4 , our results show the upper limit of the extent of the icy regions",
    "also , we have assumed , as did previous researchers , that the radius of the snow line in the gas disc is equivalent to the radius of the snow line of the planetesimal disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , once the planetesimals grow large enough , they may decouple from the gas disc , and follow quasi - circular orbits .",
    "if they were to move over the snow line , then they would sublimate or condense at the water - ice evaporation front @xcite .",
    "the process of sublimation can occur on a short timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but condensation is less well understood .",
    "@xcite find there is an extended region beyond the snow line where both icy and bare grains coexist , for a radial distance of about @xmath47 .",
    "this should be investigated further in future work with a disc model that tracks the evolution of the water .",
    "while @xcite investigated this phenomenon in a fully turbulent disc , such calculations should be extended to a disc that contains a dead zone .",
    "there are other unknown parameters in the model such as the value of the critical magnetic reynolds number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the viscosity parameter @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite showed that in order to reproduce fu orionis outbursts , @xmath48 must be a few @xmath49 .",
    "there is also some uncertainty about whether the surface density in the turbulent surface layer is determined by ohmic resistivity ( as we have assumed ) or if ambipolar diffusion or the hall effect could play an important role ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on this last point",
    ", however , @xcite find the ohmic resistivity term provides an average value for the active layer surface density for a range of vertical magnetic fields .",
    "we should also note that there appears to be some inconsistency between the accretion rates predicted by these dead zone models and observed t tauri rates .",
    "the work presented here is not intended to be a comprehensive study of the evolution of the snow line .",
    "rather , the purpose is to show that the formation a dead zone in a protoplanetary disc _ can _ keep the outer snow line farther away from the central star .",
    "thus , a model that includes a dead zone can provide a solution to the problem that the earth must form from water - devoid planetesimals that may not be present at @xmath1 in a fully turbulent disc model .",
    "this should be investigated further in future work with more detailed numerical simulations once some of the current issues have been resolved .    on a more speculative note ,",
    "the inner icy region , not predicted by the turbulent disc model , could allow for the formation of icy planets or gas giants in the inner regions of exo - solar systems .",
    "for example , at a time of @xmath50 there is a mass of @xmath51 in the inner icy region of the disc .",
    "the cores of giant planets are usually assumed to form in the cool region beyond the outer snow line .",
    "for example , hot jupiters are giant planets that are very close to their central star .",
    "they are thought to have migrated through the disc to their current position ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , with the proposed disc model ( including a dead zone ) it is possible that they could form much closer to the star , and closer to their observed locations . the newly formed core would not migrate inwards very fast because it would be within a dead zone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the dead zone extends closer to the star than the icy region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the inner icy region could exist for around @xmath52 leaving perhaps sufficient time for giant planet core formation .",
    "however , we note that in order to form icy planetesimals we need not only a low temperature , but also water vapour to be present . for example",
    ", if the cold gas is dry , then icy planetesimals will neither form , nor will ice be added to pre - existing planetesimals .",
    "the speculative possibility of the formation of hot jupiters at their current location needs further investigation .",
    "we have computed the evolution of the icy regions of a protoplanetary disc that contains a dead zone .",
    "the disc evolves from times of high infall accretion through fu orionis outbursts to late times when the infall accretion rate is negligible and planetesimals are thought to form . in a fully turbulent disc ,",
    "the unique snow line passes inside the radius of the earth s orbit causing problems for the formation of our water - devoid planet earth .",
    "however , when a dead zone forms in the disc , it prevents mass flow through the disc and the outer regions become self - gravitating .",
    "the turbulence driven by self - gravity increases the temperature of the outer parts of the dead zone and thus the outer icy region is much farther from the star as shown in the sketches in fig .",
    "our model also predicts an inner icy region during early times of disc evolution , while a dead zone is present .",
    "this moves inside the radius of the earth s orbit after a time of around @xmath0 .",
    "the outer icy region exists at all times but has a minimum radius of around @xmath41 , allowing for the formation of our water - devoid planet at its current radius .",
    "the key point of the present work is that the inclusion of a dead zone in time - dependent protoplanetary disc models can significantly change the evolution of the snow line .",
    "we have shown that it could resolve the apparent contradiction of the formation of the earth from water - devoid planetesimals and it also introduces the possibility for icy planet formation close to the central star .",
