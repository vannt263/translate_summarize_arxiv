    "the importance of coulomb ionic mixtures can not be understated in many fields of physics and astrophysics . in astrophysics ,",

    "similar properties possess also dusty plasmas ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) with numerous applications in science and technology .",
    "the properties of dense coulomb plasmas are also important for inertial confinement fusion ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , antimatter ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) , and ultra cold plasmas ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "many applications of such plasmas involve diffusion .    to describe ion diffusion in coulomb plasmas one needs the expressions for the diffusion currents and diffusion coefficients .",
    "the first problem was addressed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the second problem is discussed here .",
    "there is comprehensive astrophysical literature devoted to diffusion of ions in dense stellar matter .",
    "the specific feature of this diffusion is the long - ranged coulomb interaction between ions . in this respect",
    "the diffusion of ions has much in common with the diffusion of particles interacting via a yukawa potential with sufficiently large screening length .",
    "the physics of diffusion has many aspects .",
    "one can study different types of diffusion coefficients .",
    "most often considered are self - diffusion coefficients @xmath0 and , somewhat less often , but more important , interdiffusion coefficients @xmath1 , which enter the expressions for the diffusion currents . here , @xmath2 enumerate ion species in a multicomponent plasma ( mcp ) . in a one - component plasma ( ocp ) of ions",
    "there is only one self - diffusion coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "note that a self - diffusion coefficient @xmath0 in mcp should not be confused with a self - diffusion coefficient @xmath3 in ocp .",
    "one can further consider weak or strong coulomb coupling , classical or quantum ion motion , the presence of a magnetic field , degenerate or non - degenerate electrons , etc .",
    "diffusion is studied with different techniques such as the chapman - enskog approach , green - kubo relations , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , and effective potential method , as well as other methods and their combinations .",
    "some of these cases and methods are discussed below in more detail .",
    "we mainly focus on the inter - diffusion of ions in binary ionic mixtures ( bims ) which form either boltzmann gas or a strongly coupled coulomb liquid .",
    "the ions are assumed to be fully ionized and the electrons strongly degenerate ( although these restrictions are not very important ) .",
    "the diffusion in a gas is a classical issue , well studied and described in well - known monographs @xcite ; the diffusion in liquid is less elaborated .",
    "our aim will be to provide a unified treatment of the diffusion coefficients in ion gas and liquid and to present the results in a form convenient for using in numerical simulations of ion diffusion and related phenomena . in a bim",
    ", there is one independent interdiffusion coefficient @xmath4 and two self - diffusion coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "weak coulomb coupling means that the ions constitute almost ideal gas .",
    "they are moving more or less freely and diffuse due to relatively weak coulomb collisions with neighboring ions .",
    "the diffusion coefficients in this limit are usually expressed through a coulomb logarithm @xmath7 , which can be estimated as the logarithm of the large ratio of the maximum to minimum impact parameters of colliding ions .",
    "calculations are done using the classical theory of diffusion in rarefied gases ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in astrophysical literature",
    ", this theory is often called the chapman - salpeter theory ( meaning the application of the general theory to diffusion due to coulomb interaction ) .",
    "early astrophysical publications based on this theory are cited , for instance , in ref .",
    "one can further consider the classical and quantum limits in ion - ion scattering ( note that the motion of ions is always classical at weak coupling , quantum effects can emerge only in scattering events ) . in the classical limit , the minimum impact parameter in the expression for @xmath7",
    "is determined by the classical distance of the closest approach of colliding ions . in the quantum limit",
    "the minimum impact parameter is determined by the de broglie wavelengths of ions .",
    "one can also consider the cases of non - degenerate and degenerate electrons . in the latter case",
    "the electrons produce much weaker screening of the coulomb interaction ( i.e. , contribute much less to the maximum impact parameter ) than in the former case .",
    "we will focus on the classical scattering limit in the presence of strongly degenerate electrons .",
    "when the coupling becomes stronger , the ratio of the maximum to minimum impact parameters decreases reducing the coulomb logarithm . at intermediate couplings",
    "the coulomb logarithm becomes @xmath8 , and the diffusion coefficients @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a typical inter - ion distance and @xmath11 is the ion plasma frequency ( see sec .",
    "[ s : diffusion coefficients ] ) .",
    "characteristic ion - ion collision frequencies become comparable to @xmath12 , and typical ion mean free paths are @xmath13 .    at strong coupling",
    "the ions are mostly confined ( caged ) in their local potential wells ( within respective wigner - seitz cells ) and constitute either a coulomb liquid or coulomb crystal .",
    "thus , the ions mainly oscillate around ( quasi- ) equilibrium positions and diffuse through thermally activated jumps from one position to another ( neighboring ) one .",
    "the first experimental observations of the caging effect in relaxation of strongly coupled plasmas were made by @xcite . here",
    "one can distinguish the cases of classical ( the temperature @xmath14 ) and quantum ( @xmath15 ) ion motion ( where @xmath16 is the ion plasma temperature that is close to the debye temperature , with @xmath17 being the boltzmann constant ) . in the quantum case collective oscillations ( plasmons ) play an important role .",
    "as for electrons , one can study the cases of a rigid ( incompressible ) electron background or weakly polarizable background .",
    "the latter case is similar to the case of ions interacting via yukawa potentials ( with sufficiently large screening length ) .",
    "we consider the diffusion in coulomb liquid neglecting quantum effects but taking into account both cases of rigid and slightly polarizable electron background .",
    "these cases give essentially the same results .",
    "a semianalytic consideration of weak coupling was developed by @xcite who provided the expressions for @xmath18 through a coulomb logarithm and developed a computer code for calculating @xmath1 .",
    "the authors considered the cases of quantum and classical minimum impact parameters in the coulomb logarithm and introduced the resistance coefficients @xmath19 ( that determine the `` friction forces '' inversely proportional to @xmath18 ) .",
    "their results were extended and used by @xcite ( in the case of weak coupling ) who simulated the evolution of @xmath20c  @xmath21o white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite calculated binary diffusion coefficients at weak and moderate couplings using the chapman - enskog ( chapman - spitzer ) formalism with a statically screened coulomb potential .",
    "the authors presented accurate analytic fits of collision integrals ( tabulated spline coefficients ) .",

    "based on those results he suggested a simple and convenient analytic approximation , which reproduced the cases of weak and strong couplings , by introducing a generalized coulomb logarithm @xmath49 .    finally , quite recently @xcite put forward the idea that the cases of weak and strong coupling can be described within the same formalism of the effective binary interaction potential and traditional chapman - enskog theory ( even at strong coulomb coupling ! ) .",
    "they constructed some examples of the effective potential inferred from radial distribution functions of ions @xmath50 ; these functions were computed via the hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) approach .",

    "the latter method is known to be strictly valid for rarefied , weakly coupled plasmas , whereas baalrud and daligault suggested to apply it in both regimes ( gas and liquid ) .",
    "they proved that the method is reasonably accurate for calculating the selfdiffusion coefficient of ions in ocp .",
    "we have extended their consideration to bims and show that the method remains sufficiently accurate for calculating interdiffusion coefficients in bims .",
    "the combination of two well - elaborated schemes ( the hnc scheme for finding the effective potential and the chapman - enskog scheme for evaluating kinetic coefficients ) makes this method feasible for determining many interdiffusion coefficients of practical importance in bims over wide ranges of temperatures and densities .    to demonstrate the efficiency of this method we have calculated @xmath24 for five bims ( @xmath216h@xmath226he , @xmath216h@xmath20c , @xmath226he@xmath20c , @xmath20c@xmath21o , @xmath21o@xmath178se ) . in analogy with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffusion coefficients @xmath24 have been expressed ( [ e : lambda - eff - def ] ) through a generalized coulomb logarithm @xmath49 .",
    "we have approximated all calculated values of @xmath49 by a unified fit formula ( [ e : lambda - fit ] ) which contains five fit parameters for each bim ( listed in table [ tab : fitparam ] ) . in this way we have obtained a unified description of the interdiffusion coefficients for these bims .",
    "we may easily consider other bims if necessary .",
    "let us stress once more that in the strongly coupled plasma the employed effective potential approach @xcite is phenomenological .",
    "we expect that our results can be less accurate in this limit than in the limits of weak and intermediate coulomb couplings .",
    "however , when the temperature decreases to the melting temperature @xmath36 , quantum effects in ion motion can become important for various properties of the matter ( e.g. , ref .",
    "in particular , they can affect diffusion , and the effect has not been studied at all , to the best of our knowledge . in this situation (",
    "the quantum effects are neglected anyway ) our approach seems reasonable ( although the incorporation of quantum effects would be desirable ) .",
    "although we have not focused on self - diffusion coefficients in bims , we remark that they are most probably calculated by the effective potential method less accurately than the self - diffusion coefficients in ocp @xcite .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon is not entirely clear .",
    "it be may because the calculation of self - diffusion coefficients @xmath227 for one component in a bim requires not only @xmath228 , but also @xmath229 , whereas , according to sec .",
    "[ s : discussion ] , the computation of the interdiffusion coefficient @xmath18 primarily requires only @xmath229 .",
    "this problem remains to be solved along the basic problem of why the effective potential is reasonably successful in the regime of strong coupling .",
    "our results ( combined with those of ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be used to study various diffusion processes of ions in the crust of neutron stars and in the cores of white dwarfs ( e.g. refs.@xcite ) as well as in dense coulomb plasmas of giant and supergiant stars and giant planets .",
    "such diffusion processes can affect thermodynamics and kinetics of dense matter , thermal and chemical evolution of these stars , and their vibrational properties ( seismology ) .",
    "the diffusion properties of coulomb plasmas are also important for dusty plasmas , inertial confinement fusion , etc .",
    "( sec .  [ s : introduct ] ) .",
    "numerically , our diffusion coefficients are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by other authors and with different techniques ( sec .",
    "[ s : introduct ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of our results is in simplicity , uniformity , and convenient approximate expressions .",
    "another important advantage is that the effective potential method can be easily generalized for calculating other kinetic properties of strongly coupled coulomb plasmas , for instance , the diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients in multicomponent ion mixtures which are needed for applications but which are almost not considered in the literature .",
    "however , we should warn the reader once more that the method of an effective potential at strong coulomb coupling is phenomenological in its essence",
    ". it would be important to justify this method and understand the conditions at which it is most accurate",
    ". it would be even more important to study diffusion in strongly coupled coulomb plasmas taking into account quantum effects in ion motions . however , all these difficult issues seem to be beyond the scope of the present investigation",
    ".    although we have a considered rigid ( almost incompressible ) electron background , the results can be easily generalized to the case of compressible background produced by electrons of any degeneracy and relativity .",
