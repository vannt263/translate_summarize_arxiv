    "muon propagation through thick layers of matter was in the scope of interest for a long time since the first underground experiments with natural muon and neutrino fluxes had started .",
    "development of `` underground '' technique has led to creation of number of underground , underwater and under - ice detectors by which a wide spectrum of problems is presently under investigation .",
    "accurate calculation of muon transport plays an important role for such experiments because _ ( a ) _ neutrinos are detected by muons which are born in @xmath3 interactions and propagate a distance in medium from the point of interaction to a detector ; _ ( b ) _ muons which are produced in atmospheric showers generated by cosmic rays represent the principal background for neutrino signal and therefore their flux at large depths should be well known ; _ ( c ) _ atmospheric muons deep under sea or earth surface are the only intensive and more or less known natural calibration source which allows to confirm correctness of the detector model by comparison experimental and expected detector response ; _ ( d ) _ flux of atmospheric muons itself carries the physical information which is of interest .    along with analytical and semi - analytical methods ( refs .",

    "there are several mc muon transportation algorithms currently in use ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed analysis of their advantages and disadvantages ) , but essential theoretical and experimental progress of last years makes to create new ones . here",
    "we present a mc muon propagation code mum ( muons+medium ) written in fortran which possesses some advantages in accuracy and flexibility over analogous simulation algorithms ( although it does not contain some important features in its current version , e.g. it does not give the 3d information about angular and lateral deviations of muons ) .",
    "the algorithm has been developed for the baikal deep underwater neutrino experiment ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) but we believe it to be useful also for other experiments with natural fluxes of high energy muons and neutrinos .",
    "when working on mum we aimed at creation of an algorithm which would :    * account for the most recent corrections for the muon cross sections ; * be of adequate and known accuracy , i.e. does not contribute an additional systematic error which would exceed one from `` insurmountable '' uncertainties ( e.g. with muon and neutrino spectra and cross sections ) and whose value would be well known for any setting of simulation parameters ; * be flexible enough , i.e. could be optimized for each concrete purpose to desirable and well understood equilibrium between computation time and accuracy and be easily extended for any medium and any correction for the cross sections of the processes in which high energy muon looses its energy ; * be `` transparent '' , i.e. provide user with the whole set of data related to used models for the muon cross sections ; * be as fast as possible .",

    "the basic features of the mum algorithm are as follows .",
    "* the code does not use any preliminary computed data as an input , all necessary tables are prepared at the stage of initiation on the base of five relatively short routines , four of which return differential cross sections @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is muon energy , @xmath6 is fraction of energy lost @xmath7 ) for bremsstrahlung , direct @xmath8-pair production , photo - nuclear interaction and knock - on electron production , correspondingly , and fifth one does stopping power due to ionization @xmath9_{ion}$ ] ( see appendix  [ app : cs ] for corresponding formulas ) .",

    "* the code combines algorithms for muon transportation through thick layers of matter down to detector and for simulation muon interactions within detector sensitive volume ( these algorithms have to differ from each other ) .",
    "this is important for deep underwater and under - ice cherenkov neutrino telescopes ( see refs .",

    "put your attention to the right edge of spectra which shifts toward low energies when @xmath11 increases ( it is the most noticeably for @xmath11 = 0.2 ) .",
    "the reason is that at any slant depth energy of the most energetic muons in simulated beam is determined by cel .",
    "these muons due to statistical fluctuations did not undergo interactions with @xmath12 and , consequently , lost energy only by cel which grows when @xmath11 increases .",

    "fraction of muons which did not undergo an `` catastrophic '' act with @xmath12 till given slant depth grows with increase of @xmath11 because free path between two sequential interactions with @xmath12 grows approximately as @xmath92 .",
    "it leads , in particular , to distinctly visible separated picks in spectra for @xmath11 = 0.2 consisted just of muons which lost energy only by cel .",
    "also some deficit of low energy muons appears if one sets @xmath11 to a large value . in this case",
    "left edge of spectrum is provided only with muons which interacted with large fraction of energy lost while for smaller @xmath11 an additional fraction of muons comes here .",

    "when simulated muon beam goes through a medium loosing energy both in cel and sel processes , its spectrum is constantly shifting to the left ( energy decreases ) .",
    "for @xmath11 = 10@xmath50 the left part of spectrum reaches @xmath5 = 0 at a smaller slant depth comparing with larger @xmath11 and survival probability starts to decrease . at the same slant depth survival probability for @xmath11",
    "= 10@xmath51 and @xmath11 = 0.2 is still equal to 1 .",

    "large @xmath11 starts to play an opposite role .",
    "due to more powerful cel muons stop faster comparing with accurate simulation .",
    "so at the final part of the beam path simulated survival probability for large @xmath11 decreases faster comparing with accurate simulation and , for instance , for @xmath11 = 0.2 the rest of muon beam which reaches the slant depth @xmath69 = 2.72 km ( 37% of initial number of muons ) completely vanishes within the next 30 m of path , while some fraction of muons simulated with @xmath11 = 10@xmath50 ( 0.07% ) escapes down to the slant depth of @xmath69 = 3.2 km . qualitatively the same effect leads to the same consequences if one treats ionization as completely `` continuous''process . again",
    ", spectra becomes more narrow since fluctuations in ionization do not work and , as a consequence , survival probability becomes significantly higher comparing with simulation with accurate treatment of ionization at the beginning of muon beam path and falls down essentially faster at the final part of path .",
    "results presented above showed the significant influence which both model of ionization and value of @xmath11 have over survival probability for mono - energetic muon beam .",

    "we did not investigate specially the influence of simulation parameters on the results for the muon flux originated from neutrino but simple argumentation may be applied for this case .",
    "in contrast with atmospheric muons whose source is far away of underwater , under - ice or underground detector and whose flux may only decrease when passing from the sea level down to detector depth , the source for muons which are produced in @xmath3 interactions is uniformly distributed over water and/or rock both out- and inside the array .",

    "the main disadvantage is that mum in its reported version does not still treat the three dimensions like , e.g. propmu and music codes .",
    "so it can not be used to obtain lateral and angular deviations of muons at propagation through matter .",
