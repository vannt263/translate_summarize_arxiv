    "single - molecule magnets represent a new class of `` zero - dimensional '' magnetic materials consisting of almost non - interacting , identical point - like nanoscale entities @xcite .",
    "these magnetic molecules have attracted a great deal of attention from physicists as well as chemists for detailed studies of many novel aspects of mesoscale magnetism , such as quantum spin tunneling , spin relaxation of mesoscopic magnets , the implications of the topological spin phase ( berry phase ) , etc . @xcite .",
    "the mn@xmath0o@xmath0[ch@xmath2coo]@xmath34h@xmath4o compound @xcite , often referred to as mn@xmath0-acetate or simply mn@xmath0 , is one of the best - studied examples of this kind of materials .",
    "relatively slow dynamical processes taking place in not too strong magnetic fields , when the intramolecular spin excitations can be ignored , have been widely studied in experiments , and the properties of the ground - state multiplet @xmath5 are known very well .",
    "correspondingly , most of the theoretical treatments of mn@xmath0 have been based on the rigid - spin model ( see e.g.  refs .   ) , assuming that the molecule s magnetic subsystem can be represented as a single collective spin @xmath5 . on the other hand , the internal magnetic and electronic structure of the mn@xmath0 molecules and the intramolecular interactions responsible for the formation of the molecule s collective spin",
    "have been studied in less detail .",
    "several experiments including inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , megagauss field magnetization measurements @xcite , and optical absorption @xcite have been performed to clarify the internal properties of the mn@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the experimental data have been analyzed within the spin - hamiltonian approach @xcite , however , the resulting information was not systematic , and often did not lead to unequivocal conclusions ( see e.g.the discussion of different parameter sets in ref .  ) .",
    "another approach to investigate intramolecular properties is _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
    "so far , density - functional computations of the electronic structure for mn@xmath0 have been carried out within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for transition metal - oxide systems the standard density functional methods ( lda or gga ) do not give reliable information on the energy gaps and magnetic superexchange interactions @xcite , and many - body effects should be taken into account at least in the simplest form of the lda+u approximation @xcite .",
    "this is essential , e.g. , for an adequate description of  the electronic structure and the spin excitation spectra in mno @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath0-acetate is also an insulating metal - oxide system with an energy gap of order @xcite of 2 ev , whereas the existing calculations @xcite give a finite density of states ( dos ) and small pseudogap at the fermi level . as a result",
    ", the total spin per molecule turns out to be non - integer , in contradiction with experimental results .",
    "futhermore , the intramolecular exchange couplings in mn@xmath0 have never been calculated before .",
    "the gga calculations have recently been performed @xcite for another single - molecule magnet , v@xmath6 , but the resulting values had to be reduced by a factor of three to achieve an agreement with the experiments .",
    "this difference could also be caused by the neglect of the on - site coulomb repulsion , since the latter is known to decrease the calculated exchange interactions in the metal - oxide compounds @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of first - principle lda+u calculations of the electronic structure and exchange interactions for mn@xmath0 .",
    "we show that the account of the many - body effects within the lda+u approximation gives a reasonable picture of the electronic structure , with a finite energy gap and an integer value of the total spin of the molecule . moreover , for the first time we present the calculated data for the intramolecular exchange constants in mn@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the results of our calculations and compare them with the existing experimental data and previous theoretical studies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i we describe the computational scheme and the approximations employed in this work . in section",
    "ii the resulting electronic structure and calculated magnetic moments in mn@xmath1 are presented .",
    "section iii is devoted to the computation of the intramolecular exchange interactions .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the calculations have been performed for the crystal structure found by t.  lis @xcite with the simplifications similar to those made in ref .",
    "( all the methyl groups ch@xmath2 have been replaced by hydrogen atoms and the water molecules were omitted ) .",
    "therefore , the real calculations have been done for the system mn@xmath0o@xmath0(hcoo)@xmath7 .",
    "part of this system is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figtot ] , showing the arrangement of the manganese ions and the oxygens bridging them .    to start the lda+u calculations one needs to identify the regions where the atomic characteristics of the electronic states have largely survived ( `` atomic spheres '' ) . within these atomic spheres",
    "one can expand an electron wave function in terms of a localized orthonormal basis @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes the site , @xmath10 is the main quantum number , @xmath11  orbital quantum number , @xmath12  magnetic number and @xmath13  spin index ) .",
    "the density matrix is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the elements of the green function matrix in this localized representation ( the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 will be defined later ) . in terms of the elements of this density matrix @xmath17 ,",

    "in addition to the usual lda potential , we find an effective single - particle potential @xmath30 to be used in the effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath31 the linearized muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method in the orthogonal approximation@xcite has been used for the lsda calculations .",
    "using our green s function method we can obtain the effective exchange interaction parameters via the energy variation at small spin rotations @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expression in the lda+u scheme takes the form @xcite @xmath32 where the spin - dependent potentials @xmath33 are expressed in terms of the potentials of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , @xmath34 while the effective intersublattice susceptibilities ( @xmath9 and @xmath35)are defined in terms of the lda+u eigenfunctions @xmath36 as @xmath37 as a ground state , the standard spin arrangement has been chosen with the spins of mn1 ions directed down and the spins of mn2 and mn3 ions directed up .",
    "this arrangement was self - consistent . to check the applicability of the localized spin models to mn@xmath0 the calculations for the ferromagnetic configurations ( all spins up )",
    "have also been performed .",
    "detailed calculations have been carried out for the three values of @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ev keeping constant the value of the intra - atomic hund s exchange parameter @xmath40 ev , to check the sensitivity of the results with respect to variation in the local coulomb repulsion @xmath24 .",
    "for all values of @xmath24 used in the calculations , the system turns out insulating with the energy gap between @xmath41 ev , and the integer moment of the ferrimagnetic ground state @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "dependence of the calculated quantities on the value of @xmath24 can be inferred from the data in the table [ momreal ] , and as one can see , for most of the properties the dependence on @xmath24 is reasonably weak .",
    "the value @xmath44 ev seems to be slightly preferrable ; it is known that this value gives good agreement with experiments for other manganese - oxide systems , and agrees reasonably well with the independent theoretical calculation @xcite giving the value of @xmath45 ev .",
    "therefore , below we discuss in detail only the case of @xmath44 ev .    to begin with ,",
    "let us compare the results given by lda and lda+u approaches . in figs .",
    "[ figldau ] and [ figlda ] , we show the calculated partial densities of states ( dos ) for different manganese atoms and for the oxygen atoms belonging to the exchange bridges .",
    "our lda curves for the dos are similar to those obtained in refs .   using the gga approach .",
    "the main distinction of the lda+u results as compared with the lda is the nonzero energy gap instead of the finite dos at the fermi level .",
    "moreover , there is a difference in the dos peaks structure .",
    "all manganese ions in mn@xmath0 molecule are in distorted octahedral coordination , correspondingly , one can see the three peaks of @xmath46 character situated below the two @xmath47-like peaks . for the lda calculations the spectral density is strongly concentrated within the region @xmath48",
    "ev near the fermi level , see fig .",
    "[ figlda ] , while for the lda+u calculations , the dos is spread rather uniformly over the region of about 10 ev .",
    "it is known that the lda+u approach is effective for consideration of charge separation and charge ordering phenomena @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath0 molecules also exhibit mn@xmath49 ",
    "mn@xmath50 disproportionality , which has been directly demonstrated by the measurements of the x - ray absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "the majority spin dos curves ( see fig .  [ figldau ] )",
    "demonstrate three occupied @xmath46 peaks and two empty @xmath47 peaks for mn1 , while for mn2 and mn3 ions only one @xmath47 peak is empty ; this picture indeed corresponds to the charge disproportionality detected in the experiments .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "there are indications that the manganese - oxygen bonds are considerably covalent , and @xmath51 states of manganese are highly hybridized with @xmath52 states of oxygen . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figldau ] , the main features in the partial dos of manganese ions have counterparts in the partial dos of oxygen ions .",
    "another indication of the strong covalence is the discrepancy between the sum of the local @xmath51-moments of mn ions and the total magnetic moment of the molecule which is calculated from the total dos .",
    "the difference , which is of order of @xmath53 , can be attributed to the partial moments of oxygens estimated to be of order of @xmath54 .",
    "the value of the energy gap calculated within lda+u scheme varies from 1.78 ev to 2.01 ev with the change in the value of @xmath24 from 6 ev to 8 ev .",
    "recent optical measurements @xcite show the features in the absorption and reflection spectra in the region of the charge - transfer excitations at 1.7 ev , 2.0 ev , and 2.4 ev .",
    "magneto - optical measurements @xcite also show the latter feature .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with the calculated energy gap .",
    "at present , there is no reliable quantitative information about the intramolecular exchange couplings in the mn@xmath0 molecules , making difficult the validation of the corresponding computational results .",
    "crude estimates for the exchange couplings , based on the comparison with different manganese - oxygen compounds , have been presented in ref .   .",
    "quantitative evaluation of the exchange constants has been performed in ref . using the results of the megagauss - field experiments",
    ", however the magnetization curves appeared to be not very sensitive to the values of the exchange parameters .",
    "another quantitative approach , based on the inelastic neutron scattering data , has been undertaken @xcite , but a simplified eight - spin model was used which makes the fitting not conclusive ( see the discussion of various possible sets of parameters in ref . ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that it makes sense to focus the discussion of our results on qualitative trends in the calculated parameters instead of their exact values .",
    "the exchange parameters have been calculated for different values of @xmath24 , see table [ momreal ] . as expected for the superexchange mechanism , the values of the couplings decrease with increasing @xmath24 ; again , below we discuss only the values corresponding to @xmath44 ev .",
    "we have compared the calculated values of the exchange parameters with the data suggested in refs .  , see the table [ exchreal ] . in this table",
    ", we have shown only the interactions between relatively closely situated manganese ions ; the exchange parameters between distant ions do not exceed 23 k. as one can see , the values obtained in our calculations are closer to those resulting from the analysis of the megagauss - field experiments , while the data suggested from general chemical consideration are bigger by about a factor of three .",
    "however , the more interesting fact is that the exchanges between the mn@xmath50 ions are not all equal , as assumed in refs .. the mn@xmath50 ions in mn@xmath0 molecules are arranged in the four corners of a cubane ( distorted cube , see fig .",
    "[ figcub ] ) while the other four corners are occupied by the oxygens providing superexchange bridges between the manganese ions .",
    "therefore , the manganeses form a distorted tetrahedron with four short edges of the length 5.33 a.u . and two long edges of the length of 5.56 a.u . , and the angles mn - o - mn in the cubane which correspond to the long and short edges of the manganese tetrahedron are 95.5@xmath55 and 100.6@xmath55 . in spite of the moderate difference in the angles and lengths of the exchange pathways , the calculated coupling parameters turn out very different ; the interactions @xmath56 for the longer pathways are about three times smaller than the interactions @xmath57 for the shorter ones .    all the previous considerations @xcite of the exchange interactions in mn@xmath0 were based on the localized heisenberg model , assuming that the values of the magnetic moments and the exchange parameters do not depend on the spin arrangement of the molecule . to check the accuracy of this assumption",
    ", we have performed the calculations for the totally ferromagnetic spin configuration , when all manganese spins are directed up , using the parameters @xmath44 ev and @xmath40 ev . the results are the following : @xmath58 comparing these results with the tables [ momcomp],[exchreal ] , we see that the values of the moments vary by no more than 5% , but the exchange integrals @xmath59 and @xmath57 decrease by about 25 - 30% , and the exchange @xmath60 almost vanishes .",
    "these changes are due to the strong covalency effects and the corresponding partial delocalization of the @xmath51-electrons discussed above .",
    "the energy of the exchange excitations in the mn@xmath0 molecule , e.g. , the difference between the ground - state @xmath5 multiplet and the close excited multiplet , can be crudely obtained from a simple mean - field estimate , assuming that the pairs mn@xmath50-mn@xmath49 ions form stiff dimers with the total spin 1/2 ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) .",
    "then , the energy of the ground state is @xmath62 and the energy of the first excited state is @xmath63 , so that the excitation energy is 52 k. this number is close to the values 5866 k obtained in the neutron scattering experiments @xcite . of course ,",
    "this agreement should not be taken literally ( it is a semiclassical estimate , the value of @xmath59 is not big enough , we did not take into account the contributions of relativistic interactions which could be comparable to the exchange contribution @xcite , etc . ) , but we believe that this indicates qualitative adequacy of the calculated exchanges .",
    "we have applied the lda+u approach to the study of intramolecular magnetic interactions in mn@xmath0-acetate system . we have shown that the account of the on - site coulomb interactions provides a good description of the main features of the electronic and magnetic structure , giving the finite energy gap and the integer value for the magnetic moment of the molecule .",
    "the calculated partial magnetic moments , charge disproportionality between the mn1 and mn2 , mn3 ions , and the energy gap are in agreement with existing experimental data .",
    "the calculations show significant @xmath64-@xmath65 hybridization and considerable covalency effects , and the contribution of delocalized electrons in the total magnetic moment of the molecule is about 10% .",
    "the calculated intramolecular exchange interactions are in qualitative agreement with the existing data .",
    "an interesting result of the calculations is that the interactions between the mn@xmath50 ions situated in the inner cubane are not all equal , differing by about a factor of three for different exchange - coupled pairs .",
    "the applicability of localized heisenberg model has been estimated by comparing the values of the exchange interactions for different spin configurations ( ground - state ferrimagnetic and totally ferromagnetic ) , and corresponding variation of the coupling parameters is about 30% .    authors would like to thank a. k. zvezdin , d. a. clark , and v. v. platonov for the access to the unpublished materials on the megagauss - field experiments , and to a. b. sushkov and j. l. musfeldt for providing the unpublished optical data for mn@xmath0 .",
