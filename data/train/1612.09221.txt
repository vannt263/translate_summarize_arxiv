    "the survey of magellanic stellar history ( smash , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is aimed at mapping the expected stellar debris and extended populations from interactions of the magellanic system ( ms ) and the milky way ( mw ) with unprecedented fidelity .",
    "as stellar clusters are considered , some recent outcomes have shown that there are still a substantial number of extreme low luminosity stellar clusters undetected in the wider ms periphery and the mw halo @xcite .",
    "furthermore , streams of gas and stars that might harbor stellar clusters have also been detected @xcite .    as of october 2016",
    ", 58 smash fields ( each one is an array of sixty - two 2k@xmath24k ccd detectors covering @xmath0 3 deg@xmath3 with an unbinned pixel scale of 0.27 arcsec ) have been made publicly available from the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) science data management ( sdm ) archives .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the distribution of the complete list of smash fields and those already observed and publicly available drawn with open and filled hexagons , respectively .",
    "in this letter we make use in advance of this wealth of released images to anticipate some ultimate answers about the expected undetected stellar clusters in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) periphery . in section 2",
    "we describe our search for new stellar cluster candidates , while section 3 deals with the discussion of the results .",
    "finally , section 4 summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "we downloaded calibrated , single - frame reduced images with instrument signature removed and wcs calibrations applied according to the decam community pipeline @xcite .",
    "we preferred those reprojected images which have been corrected for distortion , etc , and are better astrometrically fixed .",
    "finally , we filtered @xmath4 images with exposure times longer than 267 sec ; the deepest images obtained by the decam @xcite .",
    "then we run the daofind routine within the daophot suite of programs @xcite to produce photometric catalogs of each @xmath0 2.2 deg fov image down to @xmath4 @xmath0 24.0 mag .",
    "note that smash fields do not overlap those from the dark energy survey ( des , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are deeper than the single @xmath4 90 sec exposures of the magellanic satellites survey fields .",

    "* ) .",
    "the strategy for searching new stellar clusters in the ms was developed in @xcite with the aim of applying it to the whole vista near - infrared @xmath5 survey of the magellanic clouds system ( vmc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also used elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it executes a series of astroml routines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein for a detail description of the complete astroml package and user s manual ) , a machine learning and data mining for astronomy package .",
    "the method makes use of the range of radii and stellar densities of known large and small malleganic cloud ( l / smc ) clusters , so that it is able to detect the smallest and/or less dense clusters in the ms .",
    "@xcite searched for new star clusters in a pilot field of @xmath0 0.4 deg@xmath3 in the south - west side of the smc bar , where the star field is the densest and highest reddened region in the galaxy .",
    "based on the selection criteria mentioned above , they identified the 68 known star clusters located in that pilot field @xcite and 38 new ones ( @xmath6 a 55 per cent increase in the known star clusters located in the surveyed field ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for quantitative details concerning detection efficiency , crowding effects , cluster mass and concentration , etc .",
    "we used here two different kernel density estimators ( kdes ) , namely , _",
    "gaussian _ and _ tophat _ , and bandwidths from 0.2 up to 1.0 arcmin .    from the total number of stellar overdensities detected per field , we merged the resulting lists , avoiding repeated findings from different runs with different bandwidths .",
    "we finally identified some new stellar cluster candidates in some few smash fields depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with thick magenta open hexagons , where we also recognized the 533 known cataloged stellar clusters . from these results",
    "we conclude that it is hardly possible that any stellar cluster down to the known smallest and/or less dense limits of mc clusters has not been detected in the analyzed smash fields .",
    "the coordinates of the new stellar cluster candidates are listed in table  [ table1 ] , while 2@xmath22 arcmin@xmath3 @xmath4 images centred on them are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] of the appendix on the online version of the journal .",
    "as far as we are aware , these objects have not been included in previous peer - reviewed stellar cluster cataloging works .",
    "the estimation of their structural and fundamental parameters will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite . as can be seen ,",
    "all of them are mainly located in the outer regions of the l / smc main bodies ; no stellar cluster candidate was detected beyond those regions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have included circles of 7.4 to 4.0 deg centered on the lmc and smc , respectively , to illustrate the areas over which the new stellar cluster candidates are distributed .",
    "this result is in agreement with the positions of recently new stellar clusters detected towards the outermost northern lmc regions @xcite , as well as stellar streams ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , in the sense that previously less explored outer regions of the l / smc can harbor undetected stellar clusters .     with the positions of stellar clusters in the @xcite s catalogue superimposed for comparison purposes .",

    "the apparently small number of new stellar cluster candidates detected throughout 58 smash fields ( @xmath0 174 deg@xmath3 ) caught our attention , since mapping the ms to a surface brightness limit of @xmath0 35 mag / arcsec@xmath3 ( @xmath4 @xmath0 24.0 mag * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig1 ] with blue , red and magenta colors , respectively .",
    "they embrace 13 , 62 and 69 smash fields of which 4 , 18 and 13 were used here for searching for new stellar clusters .",
    "other analyzed 23 fields placed in the l / smc main bodies , are represented by black filled circles and were not considered in this estimate because we are interested in assessing our results for the mc periphery .",
    "note also that the western side of the smc has not been observed by smash yet , so that it was not taken into account either .",
    "the analyzed fields are distributed in such a way that they are not concentrated in a particular zone of the three regions , but rather across areas larger than that for the smash 20% filling factor . because of this particular spatial distribution the completeness factor of the analyzed fields depends on both the number of fields analyzed and their distribution within each region . the more the number of fields analyzed , the higher the completeness , so that the completeness results proportional to the ratio between analyzed fields and the complete list of smash fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the analyzed fields in a particular r region can be placed all together ( at the filling factor ) or spread throughout the whole r region , so that the completeness turns out higher as the area covered by the analyzed fields is statistically more similar to that of the r region .    in order to estimate such a completeness factor we used the expression :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 represents the ratio between filled and open hexagons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and @xmath10 is a measure of the similarity between their spatial distributions , respectively . note that when the analyzed fields are placed as close as possible , @xmath10 equals @xmath9 , and when they spread throughout an r region , equals 1 .",
    "thus , the better an r area is covered by the analyzed fields , the higher the @xmath10 value . the expression ( @xmath11 )",
    "@xmath3 measures in quadrature the difference between the statistical spatial coverages given by @xmath10 and that when all the analyzed fields are placed together ( @xmath9 ) , so that 1 @xmath12 ( @xmath11 ) @xmath3 aproaches the unity when @xmath10 is closer to @xmath9 .",
    "thus , for a fixed ratio of analyzed fields @xmath9 , the completeness increases as the distance in quadrature between @xmath10 and @xmath9 increases as well . to evaluate @xmath10",
    ", we used the _",
    "kde.test _ statistical function provided by the _",
    "ks _ package ( version 1.10.4 ) .",
    "the function applies a two - dimensional kde based algorithm , able to broadly asses the similarity between data in two different arrays .",
    "the result , quantified by a p - value , is the probability , assuming the null hypothesis is true , of observing a result at least as extreme as the value of the test statistic @xcite . here",
    "the null hypothesis is that ( x , y ) coordinate samples for filled and open hexagons come from the same underlying distribution , with a lower p - value indicative of a lower probability that the null hypothesis is true .",
    "we obtained p - values of 0.98 , 0.93 and 0.93 , from which @xmath13(@xmath9,@xmath10 ) resulted to be 0.56 , 0.53 and 0.42 for r1 , r2 and r3 , respectively .",
    "the p - values show that the analyzed fields very well match the designed smash field distribution , with a lower spatial frequency though .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that , it is not obvious that a substantial number of undetected stellar clusters , compared to the number of new candidates identified here , populate the mc periphery . on the contrary , we speculate with the possibility that there could exist very few isolated stellar clusters in the mc periphery stripped out from their parent galaxies due to magellanic clouds / mw interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this speculation could fuel the present debate about whether ultra - faint objects discovered in the mw halo are dark matter free ( stellar cluster ) or dark matter dominated ( dwarf galaxy ) objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we made use of publicly available smash images to conduct a sound search for new stellar clusters in the ms .",
    "after building photometric catalogs from stars found by daofind in each image , we embarked in such a huge time consuming challenge by employing density kernel estimators with appropriate bandwidths in order to detect the smallest and/or less dense clusters in the ms .",
    "we found out 24 new stellar cluster candidates distributed in 11 different smash fields , most of them located in the outer regions of the l / smc discs .",
    "although their spatial distribution confirms that outer regions of the mc have been less explored in the past , their small number suggests that there would appear to be low chances of detecting significant number of stellar clusters there .",
    "bearing in mind that the analyzed sample of smash fields is far from being complete , we estimated the completeness factor of them by using a completeness function that depends on both the number of fields analyzed and their spatial distribution . because of such a particular spatial coverage",
    ", we found that the present sample -statistically speaking- nearly represent 50@xmath1 of the whole survey .",
    "this means that the lack of detection of a larger number of new cluster candidates could likely be the outcome once the survey be completed .",
