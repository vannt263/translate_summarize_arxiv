    "a blockmodel dictates that the probability of connection between any two network nodes is determined only by their respective block memberships , parameterized by a latent categorical variable at each node .",
    "fitting a blockmodel to a binary network adjacency matrix yields a clustering of network nodes , based on their shared proclivities for forming connections .",
    "more generally , fitting a blockmodel to any binary array involves partitioning it into blocks . in this way",
    ", blockmodels represent a piecewise - constant approximation to a latent function that generates network connection probabilities .",
    "this in turn can be viewed as a histogram - like approximation to a nonparametric generative process for binary arrays ; fitting such models is termed co - clustering [ @xcite ] .",
    "this article analyzes the performance of stochastic blockmodels for co - clustering under model misspecification , assuming only an underlying generative process that satisfies the condition of separate exchangeability [ @xcite ] .",
    "this significantly generalizes known results for the blockmodel and its co - clustering variant , which have been established only recently under the requirement of correct model specification [ @xcite ] .",
    "we show that blockmodels for co - clustering satisfy consistency properties and remain interpretable whenever separate exchangeability holds .",
    "exchangeability is a natural condition satisfied by many network models : it characterizes permutation invariance , implying that the ordering of nodes carries no information [ @xcite ] .",
    "a blockmodel is an exchangeable model in which the connection probabilities are piecewise constant .",
    "blockmodels also provide a simplified parametric approximation in the more general nonparametric setting [ @xcite ] .",
    "in addition to providing oracle inequalities for blockmodel @xmath1-estimators corresponding to profile likelihood and least squares optimizations , we show that it is possible to identify clusterings in data  what practitioners term",
    "_ network communities_even when the actual generative process is far from a blockmodel .",
    "the main statistical application of our results is to enable co - clustering under model misspecification .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the task of community detection [ @xcite ] , but the drawing of inferential conclusions in this setting has been limited by the need to assume a correctly specified model .",
    "our results imply that community detection can be understood as finding a best piecewise - constant or simple function approximation to a flexible nonparametric process . in settings where the underlying generative process is not well understood and the specification of models is thus premature , such an approach is a natural first step for exploratory data analysis .",
    "this has been likened to the use of histograms to characterize exchangeable data in nonnetwork settings [ @xcite ] .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : modelelicit ] , we introduce our nonparametric setting and model . in section  [ sec : oracle ] we present oracle inequalities for co - clustering based on blockmodel fitting . in section  [ sec : consistency ]",
    "we give our main technical result , and discuss a concrete statistical application : quantifying how the collection of co - clusterings of the data approaches that of a generative nonparametric process .",
    "we prove our main result in section  [ subsec : sketch ] , by combining a construction used to establish a theory of graph limits [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] with statistical learning theory results on @xmath2-statistics [ @xcite ] . in section  [ subsec : simulations ] we illustrate our results via a simulation study , and in section  [ sec : discussion ] we relate them to other recent work .",
