    "many physical theories are based upon systems of partial differential equations which contain more equations than variables like maxwell s equations or general relativity .",
    "the initial data for the time evolution equations can not be given freely , they must satisfy constraints .",
    "it is necessary for the consistency of the theory , that for any data of the time evolution equations which initially satisfy the constraints , the constraints are satisfied for all times .",
    "this property is called `` propagation of constraints '' .",
    "+ let us consider maxwell s equations in vacuum as a simple example .",
    "the time evolution equations tell us that the time derivative of the electric and magnetic field are proportional to the curl of the magnetic and electric field .",
    "the vanishing of the divergence of the electric and magnetic field are the constraints .",
    "it can easily be shown that the constraints propagate .",
    "+ in cases where the solutions of a system of partial differential equations are determined by numerical means we can not expect to get an exact propagation of the constraints .",
    "due to the discretisation of the equations the numerical solution deviates from the exact solution by the discretisation error . as a consequence ,",
    "the constraints are not fulfilled exactly after having evolved for some time , even if the initial data solved the constraints . in the spirit of  @xcite",
    "we call a discretisation of the time evolution equations compatible with the constraints , if the numerical violation of the constraints has the same convergence order as the discretisation of the time evolution equations",
    ". unfortunately the experience of numerical relativity shows that compatibility is not sufficient for obtaining numerical solutions with small numerical violations of the constraints . in many cases the violation of the constraints seems to grow at least exponentially with time",
    "this effect is believed to be a major contribution to the numerical error of numerically calculated solutions .    in this work",
    "we examine the effect of changing the evolution equations outside the submanifold of data on which the constraints are satisfied .",
    "although our method is different , we should mention that already in  @xcite such a change has been suggested .",
    "furthermore , to our knowledge , we perform the first systematic analysis of the correlation between the violation of the constraints and the quality of numerical solutions in general relativity . + as the solutions of the field equations of general relativity satisfy the constraint equations for all times , the solutions are not affected by modifications of the evolution equations for data which do not satisfy the constraints .",
    "let us denote the subspace of the function space of solutions to the evolution equations which satisfy the constraints as `` constraint submanifold '' .",
    "in  @xcite it has been proven , that at least for the linearised einstein equations the constraint submanifold can be made an attractor for the linearised time evolution equations .",
    "+ if the solution of the evolution equations automatically approaches the constraint submanifold , the system of evolution equations carries a dissipative term in it , and therefore , the numerical solution will also approach the constraint submanifold provided the grid is not too coarse . therefore , to avoid a numerical violation of the constraints , it is sufficient to make the constraint submanifold an attractor of the ( modified ) evolution equations . in such a case",
    "the constraint submanifold is ` asymptotically stable ' .    in brodbeck",
    "@xcite a general method has been proposed to derive symmetric hyperbolic extensions of symmetric hyperbolic evolution equations with first order constraints which are promising candidates for asymptotic stability .",
    "these extended systems are called @xmath0-systems .",
    "in the same article it has also been proven , that at least in the case of the linearised einstein equations there exist parameters such that the constraint submanifold is indeed an attractor for the modified evolution equations .",
    "+ as the extension of the analysis to the non - linear einstein equations seemed to be beyond the scope of present analytical techniques , we took a numerical approach in this paper and investigated the following questions : firstly , can we , simply by way of numerical experiments , find a @xmath0-system for the non - linear einstein equations for which the constraint submanifold is attractive ? and secondly , is the numerical solution of the modified systems closer to the exact solution than the numerical solution of the unmodified system ? to reduce the complexity and to have exact solutions available to compare with , we have restricted our investigations to solutions with two killing vectors .",
    "+ in our experiments we were able to find a variety of @xmath0-systems for which the violation of all constraints is improved .",
    "however , we did not find a single system for which the constraint submanifold is asymptotically stable .",
    "surprisingly , the improvement in the constraint violation did not imply an improvement of the numerical solution .",
    "+ it is important to mention that a general attractive force towards the constraint submanifold does not guarantee the numerical solution to approach the exact solution corresponding to the initial data used .",
    "regardless of the system of the field equations of general relativity , there are additional degrees of freedom which can be affected by the additional terms in the @xmath0-system . in our numerical experiments ,",
    "these additional degrees of freedom were affected in such a way that in general the numerical solution of the modified system was not closer to the exact solution , even if it was closer to the constraint submanifold .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in chapter  [ zwei ] we introduce parametrised @xmath0-systems and describe the simplifications implied by the symmetry assumptions . in the next chapter",
    "we sketch the numerical implementation , recall important features of the exact solutions used in the comparisons , and define the measures used for quality assessments .",
    "chapter  [ vier ] contains the actual numerical investigations , where we describe the performed probing of the parameter space . using selected examples we demonstrate the influence of the individual parameters on the quality of the numerical solution",
    "the construction of a @xmath0-system is based on a split of the system of equations into symmetric hyperbolic evolution equations and first order constraints  @xcite .",
    "there are various possibilities to write einstein s equations in a form like this . + in our work , we take the conformal field equations  @xcite in the first - order formulation described in  @xcite .",
    "looking at the equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) of  @xcite , it is easy to see that einstein s equations and their extension , the conformal field equations , are a `` quasilinear version '' of maxwell s equations .",
    "we use the conformal field equations instead of einstein s equations to obtain an easy and well defined treatment of grid boundaries , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the effect of the non - linearities , we can reduce the computational complexity by restricting ourselves to asymptotically a3 spacetimes  @xcite , which are spacetimes with two commuting , hypersurface orthogonal killing vector fields .",
    "we align the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coordinates with the killing orbits .",
    "our solutions do therefore not depend on the spacelike coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 . under these symmetry assumptions ,",
    "the conformal field equations can be written in the following form    [ einstein ] @xmath3    with a time coordinate @xmath4 labelling the spacelike hypersurfaces , @xmath5 being the non - killing spacelike coordinate , and    @xmath6    the tensor @xmath7 is the 3-metric , @xmath8 the extrinsic curvature of the spacelike hypersurfaces , @xmath9 the connection for @xmath7 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 parts of the tracefree part of the ricci tensor , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the electric and magnetic part of the conformal weyl tensor , @xmath14 the conformal factor , @xmath15 and @xmath16 its normal and space derivative , and @xmath17 a second derivative of the conformal factor , as described in more detail in  @xcite .",

    "when we evolve initial data forward in time by means of the evolution equations ( [ einstein1 ] ) and ( [ einstein2 ] ) , the constraints  ( [ einstein3 ] ) fulfil an evolution equation from which the propagation of the constraints can be derived .",
    "+ in the following we will call ( [ einstein1 ] ) and ( [ einstein2 ] ) the ` unextended system ' . to obtain the new , extended system ,",
    "the @xmath0-system , additional variables , called @xmath0 , are introduced and the constraint equations are extended to evolution equations for the new variables :    [ lambda ] @xmath25    the quantities @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are matrices .",

    "this system is constructed in such a way that    1 .",
    "it is symmetric hyperbolic .",
    "2 .   in the case",
    "in which the variables @xmath0 vanish identically the system is reduced to the original system  ( [ einstein ] ) .    due to the second requirement , the @xmath0-system is a generalisation of the original system .",
    "the first requirement implies well - posedness of the initial value problem .",
    "apart from the restrictions resulting from the two conditions above , the choice of the parameters @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is free .",
    "it is the aim to choose them in such a way that for all solutions of the system the variables @xmath0 decay , which then implies that the solution is driven towards a solution of the constraints . + we will now shortly explain why we have introduced these parameters .",
    "let us assume that the constraint equations are not fulfilled exactly , i.e.  @xmath30 , and @xmath31 initially . in the case of vanishing @xmath27 , the variables @xmath0 are the time integral of the violation of constraints - as a result of the new evolution equation  ( [ lambda3 ] ) . for non - vanishing @xmath27 , in addition , the @xmath32-term will have a damping or amplifying effect onto the variables @xmath0 , depending on the eigenvalues of @xmath27 . for positive eigenvalues we expect damping , for negative eigenvalues amplification .",
    "the information about the violation of constraints , saved in the variables @xmath0 , is coupled back to the variables @xmath33 by the terms @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "+ as the conformal field equations are a generalisation of einstein s equations we can relate the constraints  ( [ einstein3 ] ) , or more general , the constraints of the conformal field equations without symmetries  @xcite , to the momentum and hamiltonian constraints of the standard 3 + 1 equations .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint and the momentum constraint form a subset of the constraints used in our system .",
    "contracting equation ( 14b ) of  @xcite with the 3-metric @xmath37 and restricting it to the case of @xmath38 , we recover the momentum constraint @xmath39 , with @xmath40 . similarly ,",
    "contracting equation ( 14c ) of  @xcite twice and evaluating the 3-christoffel symbols , one can deduce the hamiltonian constraint @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the ricci scalar of the 3-metric .",
    "in this section we will describe the basic elements of the numerical implementation which we use to compare the quality of solutions obtained by solving the @xmath0-system with the quality of solutions obtained by solving the unextended system .",
    "these elements are the construction of initial data , the scheme to numerically integrate the time evolution equations , and the measures used to assess the quality of our numerical solutions .",
    "in addition we will briefly describe the exact solutions which we used as reference solutions .      in order to analyse the numerical behaviour of the @xmath0-system",
    ", we first have to construct initial data for the conformal field equations .",
    "these data are called hyperboloidal initial data .",
    "+ in  @xcite the procedure of calculating initial data has been described in detail for the case without any symmetry assumptions .",
    "we slightly modified the procedure by making use of the symmetry assumptions , namely that our spatial grid is only one - dimensional  ( 1d ) .",
    "for an exact solution we prescribe the 4-metric @xmath43 and the conformal factor @xmath14 as functions of @xmath44 . from those we calculate our variables @xmath33 and the gauge source functions",
    "numerically . the code has also got the functionality to perform a coordinate transformation to express the exact solution in new coordinates @xmath45 .",
    "+ in the calculations presented in this paper we used @xmath31 as initial setting for @xmath0 .      in order to discretise the evolution equation @xmath46 for the vector of variables",
    "@xmath47 , we adjust the second - order scheme described in  @xcite to our symmetry assumption , i.e.   we perform a strang splitting ansatz to split equation  ( [ evolution ] ) into a principal part @xmath48 and a source part @xmath49 we then solve the principal part  ( [ principal ] ) by the rotated richtmyer scheme .",
    "with one spatial dimension , this is equivalent to the standard second - order lax - wendroff method  @xcite .",
    "the source part is integrated by the pseudo - implicit heun - scheme . as described in  @xcite , principal and source part",
    "are combined in different order , depending on whether the time step is odd or even , to achieve second - order convergence .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown how superior a 4th order scheme would be . in a normal application this superiority would be a big advantage  here it is a disadvantage , however : we are going to analyse the impact of a drift away from the constraint submanifold on the quality of the solution .",
    "this drift originates in the discretisation error .",
    "if the scheme is very accurate , the drift is very small , too .",
    "but then , the differences in the quality of the numerical solutions are also very small , which makes it harder to distinguish between them .",
    "this explains why we use the second - order scheme .    in the runs described in part  [ vier ] we cover the spacelike hypersurface with 161 grid points .",
    "the length of the time step is chosen dynamically by evaluating the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition for each time slice . if not explicitly stated otherwise , we use half of what would be allowed by the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition .",
    "we use the following measures to analyse the quality of a numerical solution .",
    "+ firstly , we determine the numerical violation of the constraints as a measure of the distance from the constraint submanifold .",
    "to be able to present our findings with a limited number of plots we condense the information by using the `` norm '' @xmath50 where the summation includes all constraints @xmath51 . in the actual numerical calculations",
    "the integral is of course replaced by a sum over all grid points with @xmath52 , which represent physical spacetime . in the conformal approach to numerical relativity grid points with @xmath53 represent a formal extension of the grid without physical relevance .",
    "therefore , it would be wrong to include them into the measure . + secondly , we compare our numerical solution to the exact solution .",
    "since the numerical calculation of @xmath54 from the given solution @xmath55 involves solving elliptic equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we compare @xmath56 to the corresponding quantities from the exact solution and call the result `` pseudodifference '' @xmath57 . in  @xcite it was found that with respect to the relative error this is equivalent to the difference in the variables .",
    "again , to be able to present our findings with a limited number of plots , we condense the information by using the `` norm '' @xmath58 where the summation includes the variables in the tuple @xmath33 , but does not include the variables @xmath0",

    "motivated by the good results for the pseudodifference in run  10 and for the constraints in run  15 , we studied the correspondence of non - vanishing , diagonal parameters @xmath86 and @xmath27 for a parameter @xmath149 in runs  17 - 19 . using the same parameters @xmath150 and @xmath27 as in run  10 , but now with a non - vanishing @xmath86 , we could not improve the numerical solution in run  17 . hence , in runs  18 - 19 , we again stuck to our original choice of @xmath151 . in run  18 ,",
    "the pseudodifference first increased , before approaching the curve of the unextended system at integration times of about @xmath134 ( fig .",
    "[ plot7 ] ) . in experiment  19 , we chose the matrix @xmath152 in order to keep the symmetries of the a3 solution .",
    "again , the constraints were only improved at the cost of a worse solution .",
    "the freedom in extending a system of evolution equations with constraints to a @xmath0-system is huge . for the conformal field equations of general relativity",
    ", we have explored the effect of what we thought are natural choices in the @xmath0-system , analysing the influence on the quality of the new system s numerical solution .",
    "we found that we were able to significantly reduce the violation of the constraints , but we also found that this improvement did not imply a smaller numerical error .",
    "furthermore , we found that the significant improvement in the violation of the constraint did not prevent the solution from eventually running away from the constraint submanifold , i.e.  the @xmath0-systems used do not inherit the property of asymptotic stability from the linear system .",
    "similar experience with the semi - linear su(2)-yang - mills equations  @xcite and the study of a simplified model system  @xcite suggest that a more balanced choice of parameters of the @xmath0-system is needed to achieve an attractive force towards the constraint submanifold for all times .",
    "recent analytic results by heinz - otto kreiss and peter hbner give sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability . as we found a strong correlation between a smaller violation of the constraints and a worse numerical solution in the @xmath0-system",
