    "in the search for carriers of unexplained interstellar absorption spectra , the electronic properties of rarely studied systems offer a viable new avenue of research to explore .",
    "the set of as - of - yet unexplained visible to near - infrared peaks known as the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , for example , has remained a mystery for nearly a century @xcite .",
    "however , it has been suggested that anions may be responsible for some of the dib features @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown a relative richness of electronic absorption features below the electronic binding energy ( ebe ) @xcite for some anions that exhibit singlet dipole - bound excited states and even some species that appear to possess additional valence excitations @xcite for any dipole - bound anion , the corresponding radical must possess large a dipole moment @xcite in order for the electron to remain bound within the system . in an ideal situation",
    "the dipole moment must be at least greater than 1.625 d @xcite and probably closer to 2.5 d @xcite typically in a highly diffuse orbital @xcite .",
    "however , valence ground and excited states may exist below the single dipole - bound state which functions as the upper excitation energy limit since the dipole - bound state excitation energy must be nearly coincident with the ebe @xcite .",
    " bound excited valence states in molecular anions are rare \" @xcite . however , some anions are known to exhibit valence electronic excitations , but most of these are open - shell anions where excitations do not have to overcome the additional energy barrier of sorts involved in splitting an electron pair while still remaining below the ebe . negatively charged small fragments or atoms @xcite and , especially , carbon chains @xcite have been documented to possess bound valence excited states .",
    "additionally , some anions , including many with second row atoms , are known to possess triplet excited states above the ground state @xcite where the energy splitting between the ground state ( which may either be singlet or triplet ) and the triplet excited state is relatively small .",
    "much larger anions are also known to possess excited states , @xcite and such behavior is relevant to the study of many biological species @xcite .",
    "however , a new set of small , closed - shell singlet anions have been studied previously for their electronic properties @xcite .",
    "they represent an emerging class of anions that are not : 1 ) large , long , or exotic , 2 ) atomic , elemental , or diatomic , or 3 ) radical , diradical , or open - shell .",
    "they are closed - shell anions of three to seven atoms ( with no more than four heavy atoms ) that are composed of common substituent groups .",
    "silicon is present in each of the small singlet systems where previous study indicates the existence of valence excited states @xcite .",
    "silicon and other higher row main group elements are well - known to have very different bonding environments than their more common c , o , and n ( first row ) analogues @xcite .",
    "silicon provides many unexpected differences in the molecular structures as compared to carbon molecules of the analogous chemical formula including the butterfly conformer of si@xmath0h@xmath0 and cyclic si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "steric effects from the presence of the larger @xmath5 orbitals in the higher row atoms inhibit standard valence bond @xmath6/@xmath7 hybridization or electron pair recoupling @xcite making molecules containing these atoms  reluctant to hybridize \" @xcite .",
    "the lack of hybridization is most extreme in second row atoms , most notably for silicon , which forms strong @xmath8 bonds due to an increase in its inclusion of the @xmath9-type atomic orbitals @xcite .",
    "hence , silicon is even less likely to create bonds of significant hybridized character than its rowmates phosphorus and sulfur .",
    "the increase in @xmath9 character is most straightforwardly observed in @xmath10 sih@xmath0 where the optimal bond angle is 92.1@xmath11 , @xcite much closer to 90@xmath11 than 102@xmath11 , which the bond angle for singlet carbene @xcite .",
    "even so , the carbene carbon here exibits similar effects since the bond angles in both @xmath10 ch@xmath0 and sih@xmath0 are much less than the 120@xmath11 bond angle expected for standard @xmath7 hybridized atoms @xcite .    the previous work examining the singlet excited states of the aforementioned small , closed - shell anions @xcite employed coupled cluster methods to reproduce the experimental ebes and the lone dipole - bound state excitation energies of ch@xmath0cn@xmath1 @xcite and ch@xmath0cho@xmath1 @xcite to within 0.06 ev or better .",
    "the same accurate methodology was extended to provide likely dipole - bound and valence excited states of other anions for which experiments have not yet been performed .",
    "the present study employs the same methodology and is an examination of the excited state properties of similar molecular anions containing the second row elements aluminum , silicon , phosphorus , and sulfur and how they relate to their first row analogues .",
    "some systems analyzed have been constructed to produce structures related to those where the previous computational studies indicate the presence of dipole - bound and valence excited states for silicon - containing species @xcite .",
    "other anions of interest to this work are unique attempts to find if the larger atoms play a role in the stabilization of valence excitations below the ebe .",
    "the search for dipole - bound states provides motivation for analysis of these types of systems , but the search for even rarer valence states offers a more fascinating result .",
    "it is currently unknown how anions may affect attribution of the dibs , but the probable existence of excited states for previously unexamined molecules may hold some new insight into this near - century - old problem .",
    "coupled cluster theory is one of the most accurate quantum chemical methods developed to date , @xcite and our past @xcite and current computations of excited states of anions exclusively utilize this method extensively .",
    "the geometries are optimized at the coupled cluster singles , doubles , and perturbative triples level [ ccsd(t ) ] @xcite in conjunction with dunning s singly augmented correlation consistent triple - zeta basis set , aug - cc - pvtz @xcite and aug - cc - pv(t+d)z for the higher row atoms @xcite .",
    "spin - restricted ( rhf ) @xcite reference wavefunctions are used in computations involving the closed - shell anions while spin - unrestricted ( uhf ) @xcite wavefunctions are chosen for the open - shell radical computations .",
    "dipole moments are computed at the uhf - ccsd / aug - cc - pvtz level of theory from the uhf - ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz optimized geometry of the radical .",
    "the computation of vertically excited states from the rhf - ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz   reference geometry makes use of equation of motion coupled cluster ( eom - cc ) theory @xcite with increasingly diffuse basis sets constructed in an even - tempered fashion .",
    "inclusion of this series of basis sets provides evidence as to the classification of whether a state is valence or dipole - bound . a precipitous decrease in excitation energy from a standard cc - pvxz ( where x = d or t ) basis set @xcite to t - aug - cc - pvxz indicates the presence of a dipole - bound state .",
    "however , such is only the case if the excitation energy is below or within a computational limit ( usually 0.1 ev ) of the vertical ebe @xcite computed with the same level of theory and basis set for the reference geometry .",
    "these vertical ebes are computed with the equation of motion coupled cluster theory for ionization potentials ( eomip ) @xcite approach where an electron is removed from the homo of the anion .",
    "a valence state must also be less energetic than the vertical ebe , but its transition energy is typically much less than this limit and certainly below that of the dipole - bound state excitation energy @xcite . additionally , the decrease in vertical excitation energy with more diffuse basis sets is much less striking for a valence state where nearly all of the necessary orbital extent is recovered with the use of the aug - cc - pvxz basis @xcite .",
    "convergence is thus clearly achieved for computations involving the other , more highly diffuse bases .",
    "adiabatic computations of the ebes and excitation energies further provide insight into the potential existence of either type of excited state since they allow for a more direct comparison to experiment @xcite .",
    "adiabatic ebes represent the energy difference between ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz optimized geometries of the neutral and the anion @xcite . similarly , the adiabatic excitation energies are the energy difference between the ccsd / d - aug - cc - pvdz optimized ground state and the eom - ccsd / d - aug - cc - pvdz optimized excited state",
    ". also , the optimized geometries of the ground state radicals and dipole - bound excited states should be very similar , which gives a further means by which excited states can be classified .",
    "core orbitals are frozen in all computations : @xmath12 for b , c , n , and o with @xmath13 frozen for al , si , p , and s. all geometry optimizations are minima according to harmonic vibrational frequency analyses unless otherwise noted and discussed .",
    "the eomip - cc computations make use of the @xcite quantum chemical program package , while all other computational results were obtained using the suite of computational chemistry programs @xcite .",
    "the presence of valence excited states in silicon - containing anions from our previous studies @xcite has led us to to explore if silicon s properties are unique in the retention of anionic excited states , especially valence states , or if the general properties of higher row atoms allow for behavior similar to that previously computed .",
    "the systems chosen for this study all have closed - shell ground states that are valence in nature . in order to meet this requirement , the first set of systems considered have a methylene group on one end of the structure and a single  dipole moment inducing \" atom ( labeled as m ) on the other where the two are bridged by our atom of interest , x. these anions have the form ch@xmath0xm@xmath1 since ch@xmath0sin@xmath1 appears to possess both valence and dipole - bound excited states . in the ch@xmath0xm@xmath1 systems ,",
    "x = n , p , o , and s which compare with x = c and si from @xcite .",
    "m equals n when x is either o or s , but m = o where x = n and p. the choice of m is limited to first row atoms of groups 15 or 16 due to electronegativity effects , which influence dipole moment strength , and the lack of dipole - bound states previously computed for fluorine containing anions @xcite .",
    "the second set of systems studied are carbide groups paired with xh@xmath14 groups . here",
    "the x atoms studied are c , n , o , si , p , and s. the @xmath15 values are 2 when x = n and p , and @xmath16 for all other systems .",
    "this construction gives six different anions including c@xmath2h@xmath1 and ccsih@xmath1 .",
    "these are chosen since the carbide containing ccsin@xmath1 has been shown to possess two valence excited states , @xcite and we are exploring how the carbide moiety can affect atoms in both rows without the inclusion of further influence from the additional n atom present in ccsin@xmath1 .    the third class of systems in this study is the @xmath17 xh@xmath2yh@xmath3 systems where x = b or al and y = n or p. related systems , with bh@xmath2nh@xmath2 being the most notable , have been the subject of much computational study , especially with regards to the nature of the x@xmath4y bond length , stretching frequency , and dissociation @xcite . presently , this system allows us to probe anions with group 13 elements and further explore group 15 elements .",
    "the group 15 atoms of the xh@xmath2yh@xmath3 systems are chosen to be the y atoms in the yh@xmath0 groups .",
    "this arrangement creates dipole moments in the radicals large enough to allow potentially for dipole - bound states .",
    "additionally , some anionic and corresponding radical systems with the group 13 atoms in yh@xmath0 are not stable structures .",
    "table [ ebe ] and table [ basis ] provide a summary of the data for each of the systems of interest for this work .",
    "the first system similar to ch@xmath0cn@xmath1 and ch@xmath0sin@xmath1 listed in table [ ebe ] is ch@xmath0on@xmath1 , which is also shown in figure [ ebefig]a & figure [ adfig]a .",
    "ch@xmath0on@xmath1 is simply a replacement of the cyano carbon with an oxygen to create an anion similar to ch@xmath0cn@xmath1 .",
    "both the neutral radical and the anionic forms of ch@xmath0on are asymmetric molecules as has been shown previously for the radical @xcite . the adiabatic ebe for ch@xmath0on@xmath1 can not actually be determined here since the @xmath18 computations are not well - behaved in the scf step .",
    "however , it can clearly be determined that the ebe will be lower than 0.46 ev , which is the adiabatic ebe from consideration of the planar ch@xmath0on radical and the optimized asymmetric anion .",
    "this upper bound negates the existence of any stable excited states for ch@xmath0on@xmath1 and is much lower in energy than the vertical ebe .",
    "even though two vertically excited states are computed to lie below the vertical ebe , only one of these dipole - bound states could exist if the adiabatic ebe was much higher @xcite .",
    "isomerization of ch@xmath0on@xmath1 to ch@xmath0no@xmath1 results in a species that is more energetically favorable .",
    "the computations report that ch@xmath0no@xmath1 is 75.0 kcal / mol more stable than the ch@xmath0on@xmath1 isomer .",
    "the corresponding radicals are similarly separated by around 50 kcal / mol , which is in agreement with previous computations at various levels of theory @xcite .",
    "these two anions have comparable dipole moments of @xmath19 d as shown in table [ ebe ] .",
    "ch@xmath0no@xmath1 and its excited state properties have been previously examined by @xcite , but they are relevant for this discussion . the 1.55 ev adiabatic excitation energy to the lowest excited state ( 2 @xmath17 ) is more than 0.1 ev higher than the 1.42 ev adiabatic ebe , which indicates that this state does not exist . however ,",
    "vertical excitation energies from the rhf - ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz optimized geometry reported in table [ basis ] show a clear pattern of energy decrease with the inclusion of more diffuse functions indicative of a highly diffuse dipole - bound state .",
    "interestingly , the vertical ccsd / t - aug - cc - pvtz ebe computed via eomip is much higher than the vertical eom - ccsd / t - aug - cc - pvtz 2 @xmath17 state energy .",
    "however , the adiabatic results better model physical behavior and this leads to the conclusion that , again , ch@xmath0no@xmath1 probably does not possess any bound singlet excited states .",
    "phosphorus substitution for the nitrogen atom in ch@xmath0no@xmath1 to give ch@xmath0po@xmath1 and sulfur substitution of the oxygen atom in ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 both appear to give dipole - bound states .",
    "ch@xmath0po radical s dipole moment of 2.477 d is well above fermi and teller s @xcite theoretical 1.625 d necessary dipole moment for a dipole - bound state in the corresponding anion and right at gutsev and adamowicz s @xcite more practical 2.5 d limit .",
    "the 2.477 d dipole moment for ch@xmath0po is higher than either of the previous first row analogues , indicating that presence of the second row atom has some effect on the system .",
    "the adiabatic transition energy to the first excited state of ch@xmath0po@xmath1 , 1 @xmath20 , is computed to be 2.89 ev , while the ebe is 2.82 ev .",
    "this is within the 0.1 ev limit of computational accuracy .",
    "vertically , the ebe is 2.79 ev , and the vertical excited state energy for the t - aug - cc - pvdz basis set is the same .",
    "coupling these factors with a steep decline in the vertical excitation energy for increasingly more diffuse basis sets shown in table [ basis ] gives classic behavior of a dipole - bound excited state .",
    "however , the excitation into a highly diffuse @xmath9-type ( totally symmetric ) orbital necessitates that the term for the dipole - bound excited state must be directly related to the term of the radical , @xmath21 in this case .",
    "there is a second excited state of ch@xmath0po@xmath1 , 2 @xmath17 , that has an adiabatic excitation energy ( 3.08 ev ) much higher than 2.82 adiabatic ebe .",
    "its t - aug - cc - pvdz vertical excitation energy of 2.81 ev is only 0.02 ev higher than the vertical ebe .",
    "another key hallmark of a dipole bound state is that due to the diffuseness of the orbital in which the bound electron is held , the excited anion will take on not only the similar term but also the geometry of the radical whose dipole moment is binding the electron .",
    "figure [ adfig]d shows that the 2 @xmath17 ch@xmath0po@xmath1 geometry is very much like the figure [ ebefig]d ch@xmath0po geometry .",
    "additionally , only one dipole bound state can exist for any given anion @xcite .",
    "hence , the 2 @xmath17 state is actually the dipole - bound state , but the adiabatic results for this dipole - bound excited state do not suggest that it will be stable since it is more than 0.1 ev higher than the ebe .",
    "the 1 @xmath20 state of ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 behaves somewhat differently than the analogous 3 @xmath22 state of ch@xmath0on@xmath1 .",
    "there is relatively little change in the vertical excitation energy ( 0.72 ev ) from cc - pvdz to t - aug - cc - pvdz for the ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 1 @xmath20 state , and the vertical ebe at 2.24 ev is higher than the t - aug - cc - pvdz excitation energy at 2.04 ev .",
    "however , the change from d- to t - aug - cc - pvdz excitation energy is fairly substantial at 0.39 ev .",
    "this is over half of the total decrease in excitation energy across the range of diffuse basis sets indicating that there is a mixture of valence and dipole - bound character .",
    "even so , there is not enough pure valence character in the excitation in order for this state to be predominantly valence in nature .",
    "similar vertical cc3 excited state computations also do not give any further evidence to show that the 1 @xmath20 state is a valence state .",
    "additionally , the adiabatic excitation energy for this state is more than 0.1 ev higher than the adiabatic ebe . as a result",
    ", we must conclude that the 1 @xmath20 state of ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 is not accessible .",
    "differently , the lower @xmath23 state is the dipole - bound state since the adiabatic ebe in table [ ebe ] is 0.03 ev above the excitation energy , the basis set convergence in table [ basis ] is consistent with dipole - bound states , and the geometry of the radical in table [ ebe ] is comparable to that of the optimized @xmath23 state .    for ch@xmath0sn , both the radical and",
    "the anion are planar while its first row analogue , ch@xmath0on , is asymmetric in both electronic occupations .",
    "the  reluctance to hybridize \" @xcite in the sulfur atom allows ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 to remain planar , whereas the mos in ch@xmath0on@xmath1 force the hydrogens in the methylene group to pyramidalize .",
    "this same behavior is present in ch@xmath0cn@xmath1 .",
    "hence , the geometrical differences and the subsequent subtle changes to the orbitals for the inclusion of larger atoms from the second row alone do not bring about valence states . otherwise , the sulfur - containing anion , ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 , would have at least one valence state .",
    "while it is fascinating that these anions containing higher row atoms possess dipole - bound excited states and the analogous first row anions do not , it is the search for valence states that is driving this study",
    ". even though the ch@xmath0xm@xmath1 anions are as close as possible to the structure of ch@xmath0sin@xmath1 , these anions with second row elements do not give similar valence excitations .",
    "however , the inclusion of a single second row atom systematically increases the ebes as compared to the first row only anions .",
    "this increase appears to open up the possibility for excited states to be present in the spectra of anions containing second row atoms , but it does not guarantee the existence of stable valence states .      molecules containing a carbide group have gained recent interest in relation to the diffuse interstellar bands , @xcite and this moiety is present in ccsin@xmath1 , which has been shown to possess two valence states @xcite . as a result ,",
    "simple anions of the ccxh@xmath24 family where x = c , n , and o , as well as their second row analogues si , s , and p , are examined here .",
    "an interesting feature of the entire ccxh@xmath24 family of anions is that the corresponding radicals all have very large dipole moments from 3.409 d for c@xmath2h to nearly 6 d for @xmath25 ccnh@xmath0 .",
    "this behavior does not vary for the inclusion of the first or second row atoms ; the carbide moiety is responsible for the large dipole moments .",
    "previous computations of the dipole moment for ccoh are consistent , @xcite and the 3.409 d dipole moment of c@xmath2h is also in line with previous casscf computations of its dipole moment , 3.163 d , by takahashi and yamashita @xcite .    the c@xmath2h@xmath1 system has received much attention over the past two decades @xcite mainly examining the anion to neutral ( triplet to doublet ) photochemistry . even though it has been reported that the cyclic singlet is the most stable isomer of c@xmath2h@xmath1 , @xcite consistency for the scope of this study and how c@xmath2h relates to the other anions from groups 15 and 16 in these ccxh@xmath24 model systems mandates exploration of the excited state properties of the @xmath26 pseudo - linear @xmath17 c@xmath2h@xmath1 and the silicon analogue , ccsih@xmath1 .",
    "ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz computations put the @xmath10 @xmath27-c@xmath2h@xmath1 isomer only 6.6 kcal / mol lower in energy than the @xmath17 c@xmath2h@xmath1 isomer .",
    "the pseudo - linear singlet isomer is 6.9 kcal / mol lower in energy than @xmath28 c@xmath2h@xmath1 .",
    "fascinatingly , pseudo - linear c@xmath2h@xmath1 appears to possess a valence state .",
    "table [ ebe ] shows that the adiabatic excitation energy of the @xmath29 transition at 0.93 ev is much less than the 1.83 ev adiabatic ebe .",
    "the vertical excitation energies for the increasingly diffuse basis sets given in table [ basis ] decrease from 1.21 ev for cc - pvdz merely to 1.15 ev for aug - cc - pvdz and to 1.14 ev for the converged excitation energy for d- and t - aug - cc - pvdz .",
    "the converged vertical excitation energy is well below the 2.34 vertical ebe .",
    "finally , the excited state geometry given in figure [ adfig]k is markedly different from the radical geometry in figure [ ebefig]k , especially for the h@xmath4c@xmath30c@xmath0 bond angle .",
    "differently , the vertical excitation energy of the @xmath31 transition at 2.37 ev for t - aug - cc - pvdz is just above ( but within computational accuracy of ) the vertical ebe .",
    "however , the adiabatic computations put this state at 2.05 ev , 0.22 ev above the adiabatic ebe .",
    "our analysis strongly indicates that a valence state is present in this anion .",
    "it may yet possess a dipole - bound state in addition to its valence excited state , but our computations do not strongly support this interpretation .",
    "the silicon analogue , ccsih@xmath1 , exhibits similar behavior .",
    "the 2.06 ev @xmath32 excitation energy is also well under the 3.11 ev adiabatic ebe .",
    "table [ basis ] also confirms that the @xmath33 state is valence in nature since the more diffuse basis sets lower the vertical excitation energy for this state by only 0.04 ev . the vertical ebe at 3.27 ev is , again , well above the vertical excitation energy .",
    "differently , the @xmath34 state appears to be the dipole - bound state of ccsih@xmath1 . like the analogous @xmath23 state of c@xmath2h@xmath1",
    ", this state is also more than 0.1 ev above the ebe adiabatically , but it is only 0.12 ev higher than the ebe here .",
    "the eom - ccsd / t - aug - cc - pvdz vertical excitation energy of 3.26 ev is actually 0.01 ev less than the vertical ebe .",
    "hence , the dipole - bound state is more likely to be present in the spectrum of ccsih@xmath1 than that of c@xmath2h@xmath1 , but the presence of dipole - bound states for these systems can not be confirmed .",
    "regardless , both c@xmath2h@xmath1 and ccsih@xmath1 show clear indications of possessing @xmath33 valence states , the first time our methodology is reporting a valence state for a small anion without silicon .",
    "the valence state for c@xmath2h@xmath1 is probably the result of a more favorable orbital arrangement arising from the presence of the carbene .",
    "this allows the valence @xmath35 virtual orbital involved in the excitation to be more easily accessed photochemically .",
    "figure [ ebefig]k & figure [ ebefig]l show that the ground state structures of c@xmath2h@xmath1 and ccsih@xmath1 are both substantially bent at the c@xmath4x@xmath4h ( x = c , si ) bond angle .",
    "the c@xmath2h@xmath1 ground state c@xmath4c@xmath4h bond angle is 109.1@xmath11 , while this same angle for the radical in figure [ ebefig]k is 162.7@xmath11 .",
    "the ground state anionic c@xmath4si@xmath4h bond angle is much closer to perpendicular at 99.8@xmath11 as shown in figure [ ebefig]l .",
    "the similar c@xmath4c@xmath4h bend in c@xmath2h@xmath1 allows its orbitals to behave more like those in ccsih@xmath1 than in previous first - row - only anions studied .",
    "one interpretation of this result is that the central carbene carbon in the c@xmath4c@xmath4h bond angle in c@xmath2h@xmath1 has less  hybridized \" character since the c@xmath4c@xmath4h bond angle is noticeably less than the desired 120@xmath11 typically associated with an sp@xmath36 carbon .",
    "such a result is , again , a well - known property of singlet carbenes @xcite .",
    "consequently , the carbene carbon is behaving more like silicon , which is much less likely to hybridize @xcite as is evidenced by its even smaller c@xmath4si@xmath4h bond angle in ccsih@xmath1 ( 99.8@xmath11 in the ground state ) consistent with the 92.1@xmath11 h@xmath4si@xmath4h bond angle in singlet sih@xmath0 @xcite . further interpretation of the presence of valence states and the c@xmath4x@xmath4h bond angles of less than 120@xmath11 in both c@xmath2h@xmath1 and ccsih@xmath1 is that the the amount of recoupled pair bonding in c@xmath2h@xmath1 is much less than that present in typical carbon systems and is more like that from higher row , early @xmath37-block atoms such as silicon @xcite .",
    "the presence of the ccoh@xmath1 dipole - bound 1 @xmath20 excited state is unclear @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of the dipole - bound 1 @xmath20 excited state of the sulfur analogue analyzed in this study , ccsh@xmath1 , is more promising .",
    "this corresponding radical was first analyzed photochemically to compare its chemistry to ccoh and hcco @xcite .",
    "ccsh shares similarities with ccoh in that the 4.492 d dipole moment is similar to the 4.401 d dipole moment of ccoh .",
    "the adiabatic excitation energy for the 1 @xmath20 state of ccsh@xmath1 is approximated to be 2.82 ev since the geometry optimizations could not converge the root mean squared force to better than @xmath38 .",
    "however , this approximate excitation energy is still 0.04 ev lower than the adiabatic ebe . additionally , the trend of vertical excitations places this excitation beneath the vertical ebe , giving strong evidence that this state is present in the electronic spectrum of ccsh@xmath1 . combining these factors with the similarities in the optimized geometry of the radical and the approximate geometry of the anion , especially for the h@xmath4s@xmath4c@xmath0 bond angle from figure [ ebefig]m & figure [ adfig]m ,",
    "the 1 @xmath20 state of ccsh@xmath1 is a dipole - bound state .",
    "however , no evidence is present for a valence state of ccsh@xmath1 .",
    "it was hoped that the large 5.903 d dipole moment of the stable @xcite ccnh@xmath0 radical would increase the anionic ebe enough so that a valence state could exist , but our computations show that no valence state is present for this anion .",
    "a dipole - bound state does appear to be present for ccnh@xmath3 , an isomer of ch@xmath0cn@xmath1 , which is the anion hypothesized to be a dib carrier @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic excitation energy of the 1 @xmath39 state ( 2 @xmath17 in the vertical computations ) of ccnh@xmath3 is 2.00 ev , while the adiabatic ebe is nearly coincident at 1.97 ev , which is within the computational limit for this state to exist .",
    "the vertical computations fully place the ebe higher than the excitation energy .",
    "additionally , the optimized bond angles and bond lengths of the anion excited state and those of the radical given in figure [ ebefig]e & figure [ adfig]e show a strong correspondence , and the excited state is of @xmath25 symmetry like that of the radical .",
    "hence , the first excited state of ccnh@xmath3 is the dipole - bound state .",
    "no valence states exist .",
    "the second row analogue , ccph@xmath3 , exhibits similar dipole - bound behavior in its 2 @xmath17 state .",
    "the dipole moment of the radical is smaller than the n analogue , but it is still quite large at 4.759 d. the 2 @xmath17 state excites at 3.16 ev from adiabatic computations . the adiabatic ebe is slightly more than this at 3.21 ev , which is strong evidence that this state is bound upon excitation .",
    "additionally , the energy progression with increased diffuse character of the basis set for the vertical excitation energy of this ccph@xmath3 state clearly shows that it is indeed dipole - bound in nature and also underneath the vertical ebe .",
    "comparison of the geometries in figure [ ebefig]f & figure [ adfig]f gives further evidence for the 2 @xmath17 state to be dipole - bound . like its first row analogue , ccph@xmath3 possesses one state that exhibits dipole - bound character , but no valence states appear to be present even though the adiabatic ebe for ccph@xmath3 is 1.24 ev greater than that of ccnh@xmath3 .",
    "the xh@xmath2yh@xmath0 systems are all depicted in figure [ ebefig ] and figure [ adfig ] in items g - j .",
    "these systems are based on the dative bonding molecule ammonia borane , bh@xmath2nh@xmath2 , but the removal of a hydrogen from the nitrogen changes the bonding chemistry .",
    "for instance , experiment and theory both agree that the b@xmath4n bond length in standard ammonia borane is 1.657   @xcite .",
    "the lone pair on the ammonia molecule fills the empty out - of - plane @xmath37 orbital in the borane .",
    "hence , the bonding environment is not truly covalent but dative as evidenced by the long b@xmath4n bond length .",
    "however , our systems have shorter b@xmath4n bond lengths than other dative structures .",
    "as shown in figure [ ebefig]g , the 1.448   b@xmath4n bond length in bh@xmath2nh@xmath0 is much less than the standard ammonia borane dative bond . even though the anion has a longer b@xmath4n bond than the radical at 1.584  , this bond is still much shorter than dative bonds in similar systems @xcite .",
    "the molecules examined for this study appear to have a combination of dative and covalent bonding due to the presence of bonds longer than typical covalent bonds but not as long as dative bonds .",
    "for instance , bh@xmath2nh@xmath3 can be thought of as the aminoborane anion , a @xmath26 molecule with the plane of symmetry contained in the b@xmath4n bond bisecting the h@xmath4n@xmath4h bond angle .",
    "the borane still has its empty @xmath37 orbital which is filled not by the nitrogen s lone pair but by another pair of electrons from the nitrogen giving a standard covalent interaction while nitrogen retains its lone pair .",
    "hence , the bonding is mixed from the covalency of the amino group and the dative interaction originating from the borane .",
    "the ground state of the bh@xmath2nh@xmath0 radical actually has a different geometrical conformation than the anion .",
    "its geometry is rotated so that the plane of symmetry in this @xmath26 radical contains both the b@xmath4n bond and the h@xmath4n@xmath4h bond angle .",
    "the aminoborane anion , bh@xmath2nh@xmath3 , gives some evidence for the possession of a dipole - bound excited state .",
    "the radical has a dipole moment ( 2.524 d ) large enough for one to exist , but the 2.28 ev adiabatic ebe given in table [ ebe ] is much lower than the adiabatic excitation energy to the 2 @xmath17 state at 2.53 ev .",
    "differently , the vertical ebe of 2.88 ev given in table [ basis ] is coincident with the converged vertical excitation energy for this state . even though the energy difference between the ebe and excitation energy adiabatically appears to be too great to support a dipole - bound state ,",
    "the vertical computations show that if this excited state does exist it is probably dipole - bound .",
    "the 2 @xmath17 state of bh@xmath2nh@xmath3 has a geometry similar in many respects to that of the radical from the the bottom values of figure [ ebefig]g & figure [ adfig]g , but the h@xmath4b@xmath4h bond angle discrepancies highlight that these are geometrically different enough for the 2 @xmath17 state not to be purely dipole - bound .",
    "there is mixing in the character of the excited state wavefunction , and it is great enough to stabilize this state before it assumes an optimized geometry similar to that of the radical . regardless , our adiabatic energy difference in the ebe and excitation energy of 0.25 ev is probably too great for this excited state to exist .",
    "not surprisingly , both the bh@xmath2ph@xmath0 radical and anion have longer central bonds than the analogous aminoborane compounds due to the larger valence orbitals present in the phosphorus atom .",
    "figure [ ebefig]h shows this increase to be on the order of 0.4   for the anion and 0.5   for the radical . also , the b@xmath4p@xmath4h bond angles are smaller in the bh@xmath2ph@xmath0 systems than the b@xmath4n@xmath4h bond angles in the bh@xmath2nh@xmath0 systems .",
    "this is , again , typical of second row atoms @xcite .",
    "additionally , the @xmath26 bh@xmath2ph@xmath0 radical has its plane of symmetry bisecting the h@xmath4p@xmath4h bond angle .",
    "this is consistent with the corresponding anion but different from the bh@xmath2nh@xmath0 radical .",
    "the dipole moment of bh@xmath2ph@xmath0 is slightly larger than its first row analogue at 2.889 d. this makes it large enough for the corresponding anion to possess a dipole - bound state , which it appears to have .",
    "table [ ebe ] shows the adiabatic excitation to the 2 @xmath17 state of bh@xmath2ph@xmath3 to be 2.78 ev , while the adiabatic ebe is within our 0.1 ev cutoff at 2.74 ev .",
    "the adiabatic ebe is also nearly 0.5 ev greater than the bh@xmath2nh@xmath3 adiabatic ebe .",
    "the vertical excitation energy converges to the same value as the vertical ebe , 3.26 ev , for the double - zeta basis sets .",
    "hence , the lone stable excited state , the 2 @xmath17 state , of bh@xmath2ph@xmath3 appears to dipole - bound .",
    "the insertion of aluminum into the xh@xmath2yh@xmath3 systems brings about some interesting chemistry . from figure [ ebefig ] , the al@xmath4n bond ( 1.887  ) in alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 is longer than the original b@xmath4n bond ( 1.584  ) , but it is not quite as long the b@xmath4p bond in bh@xmath2ph@xmath3 ( 2.013  ) .",
    "additionally , the al@xmath4n bonds in both the alh@xmath2nh@xmath0 radical and anion are shorter than the previously computed al@xmath4n bond lengths in alh@xmath2nh@xmath2 , which are more than 2.0  , irrespective of the level of theory employed @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the mixed covalent / dative bonding in the boranes above .",
    "however , the n@xmath4al@xmath4h bond angle contained within the plane of symmetry in these @xmath26 molecules is beyond perpendicular for both the alh@xmath2nh@xmath0 ( 68.2@xmath11 ) and alh@xmath2ph@xmath0 ( 69.7@xmath11 ) radicals .",
    "the anions revert back to more typical bond angles @xcite once the out of plane @xmath37 orbital in the n or p atom is filled to give the standard lone pair .",
    "both alane species , alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 and alh@xmath2ph@xmath3 , have two excited states adiabatically either below or within 0.1 ev of their respective ebes as given in table [ ebe ] .",
    "the inclusion of aluminum significantly increases the ebes as compared to the aminoborane or phosphinoborane anions , especially when phosphorus is also included .",
    "the corresponding radical to alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 has the stronger dipole moment at 2.579 d whereas the dipole moment of alh@xmath2ph@xmath0 is somewhat below gutsev and adamowicz s @xcite 2.5 d limit at 2.167 d. this ensures that neither dipole moment is strong enough to bind a second dipole - bound state and maybe not a first @xcite . the only way that",
    "both states in each alane anion may be retained is if one is valence .",
    "table [ basis ] gives the vertical excitation energies and ebes for both the 2 @xmath17 and 1 @xmath20 states of both alanes . in each of the two cases ,",
    "the higher 1 @xmath20 state excitation energy ( 3.85 ev and 3.86 ev , respective of alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 and alh@xmath2ph@xmath3 ) is in the range of what we expect for a classic dipole - bound state since the ebes are 3.80 ev and 3.85 ev , respectively .",
    "the basis set convergence confirms the dipole - bound character for both states of both anions .",
    "however , if the lower energy excited states are dipole - bound , only the lower energy states can exist since only one dipole - bound state is allowed for these dipole moment magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the classification of the lower 2 @xmath17 states for each alane anion is a bit more nebulous . due to the orbitals involved in the excitation with the highly diffuse basis sets ,",
    "no vertical excitation energies for the cc - pvdz or cc - pvtz basis sets could be conclusively linked to comparable excitations utilizing the more diffuse basis sets .",
    "this is marked in table [ basis ] .",
    "the lack of correlation in vertical excitation energies does not indicate valence excitation since all previous valence excitations characterized with this methodology have had little change in the excitation energy from the cc - pvdz vertical excitation energy out to those computed with more diffuse basis sets . additionally , the vertical excitation energy convergence for the double zeta basis sets from the aug - cc - pvdz to the t - aug - cc - pvdz level has previously been less than 0.1 ev for valence states .",
    "the change in vertical excitation energies due to basis set augmentation for the 2 @xmath17 state of alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 is 0.30 ev and 0.42 ev for the 2 @xmath17 state of alh@xmath2ph@xmath3 .",
    "however , the change from d - aug - cc - pvdz to t - aug - cc - pvdz in the aminoalane anion is only 0.01 ev and 0.04 ev in the phosphinoalane . to further complicate the interpretation , the optimized geometries of the 2 @xmath17 states of both anions ( given in figures [ adfig]i & j ) are not as similar to the optimized geometries of the 1 @xmath21 states of the radicals as one would expect for dipole - bound states .",
    "for instance , the al@xmath4y ( y = n & p ) bond lengths are on the order of 0.1   longer in the anion excited states than they are in the corresponding radicals .",
    "the al@xmath4y@xmath4h bond angles are larger in the excited 2 @xmath17 states of the anion than they are in the radical : 121.8@xmath11 in the alh@xmath2nh@xmath0 radical as opposed to 125.7@xmath11 for the 2 @xmath17 state of the anion and 108.0@xmath11 for the alh@xmath2ph@xmath0 radical while the excited state of the anion has this bond angle at 126.6@xmath11 .",
    "similar to bh@xmath2nh@xmath0 , these two closely related cases appear to have mixed valence / dipole - bound character , the most of which for any anionic excited states examined so far with this methodology .",
    "it is unclear if the valence character mixed into these excited states is large enough to allow the higher , clearly dipole - bound states to exist above them .",
    "regardless , the presence of at least one excited state , the 2 @xmath17 , in the electronic spectra is possible for both alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 and alh@xmath2ph@xmath3 .",
    "in the further examination of singlet excited states of small , closed - shell molecular anions , specifically those that may possess valence excited states , we have examined new species containing the second row atoms al , si , s , and p. of the twelve new anions examined here with further inclusion of ch@xmath0no@xmath1 and ccoh@xmath1 previously studied by @xcite , nine exhibit definite bound excited state character : ch@xmath0sn@xmath1 , c@xmath2h@xmath1 , ccsih@xmath1 , ccsh@xmath1 , ccnh@xmath3 , ccph@xmath3 , bh@xmath2ph@xmath3 , alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 , and alh@xmath2ph@xmath3 . only two of these , c@xmath2h@xmath1 and ccnh@xmath3 , do not contain second row atoms .",
    "adiabatic computations indicate that ch@xmath0on@xmath1 , ch@xmath0no@xmath1 , ccoh@xmath1 , and bh@xmath2nh@xmath3 do not possess excited states , dipole - bound or otherwise , and ch@xmath0po@xmath1 likely does not either .",
    "the only silicon system examined in this study , ccsih@xmath1 , possesses two excited states : one valence and one dipole - bound .",
    "interestingly , the carbon analogue , c@xmath2h@xmath1 , also exhibits both a single valence excited state and a dipole - bound excited state .",
    "this is possibly the result of similar orbital arrangements present in both systems that was not present in those first and second row analogues previously studied . in this",
    "regard , silicon does not appear unique in its ability to foster valence singlet excited states in anions .",
    "even so , when varying the atoms at all non - hydrogen and non - dipole - inducing positions , only the inclusion of group 14 atoms has been shown to contribute to stable valence excitations for closed - shell anions . this could also be true for inclusion of a directed group 15 and 16 atom since the presence of these second row atoms increases the ebes noticeably as compared to their first row analogues .",
    "however , the properties of anions with group 15 and 16 atoms do not appear as favorable for the existence of valence excited states of closed - shell anions based on the systems analyzed both here and previously @xcite .",
    "mixing of valence and dipole - bound character in the excited state wavefunctions can be more substantial than originally thought .",
    "this is present in some of the carbide anions , but the aminoborane anion and its analogues , especially the alanes , have substantial mixing of valence and dipole - bound excited state character in their first excited states .",
    "the vertical excitation energies for alh@xmath2nh@xmath3 and alh@xmath2ph@xmath3 , for example , shift noticeably for more diffuse basis sets unlike typical valence excitations but not as much as the shifts observed for established dipole - bound anions .",
    "the mixing is also showcased in the lack of correspondence between the optimized radical and excited 2 @xmath17 state geometries .",
    "it is unclear if the amount of mixing in these first excited states gives enough valence character for the second state to play the role of the  threshold resonance , \" but the order of magnitude variance in the oscillator strengths ( table [ basis ] ) between the lower and stronger 2 @xmath17 states and the higher and less intense 1 @xmath20 states of each alane anion would make this experimentally measurable .",
    "the presence of second row atoms in the types of closed - shell anions examined thus far increases the likelihood of dipole - bound excited states since the ebe and dipole moments are both increased with the larger atoms . combining these facts with the increased prevalence of mixing for valence and",
    "dipole - bound character in the excited state wavefunction indicates that the larger atoms create environments more favorable for excitation of electrons in closed - shell anions , but the anions built around group 14 atoms , especially silicon , are the most favorable for anion excitation .",
    "finally , direct attribution of known dibs to computed anionic excitations is impractical for the present level of computational accuracy .",
    "however , the accuracy range combined with the density of the dibs ( with a band present every nm or so between 400 nm and 880 nm ) gives many options for correlation between the computed transitions of our set of anions and the various dibs @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the longest wavelength dibs at 1317.5 nm @xcite is in the proper range to be related potentially to the 1328 nm dipole - bound @xmath40 transition of c@xmath2h@xmath1 , while the 604 nm valence @xmath41 transition is within 10 nm of more than a dozen known dibs @xcite .",
