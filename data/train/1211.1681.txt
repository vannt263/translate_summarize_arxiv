    "for example , even though gmcs are often associated with spiral arms in galaxies , in the case of m51 , @xcite find that the molecular to atomic gas mass fraction does not vary significantly from inter - arm to arm regions and infer relatively long gmc lifetimes @xmath6  myr .",

    "the global galaxy simulations of followed the formation and evolution of thousands of gmcs in a milky - way - like disk with a flat rotation curve .",
    "however , with a spatial resolution of @xmath28  pc , only the general , global properties of the gmcs could be studied ; not their internal structure . following all of these gmcs to higher spatial resolution",
    "is very expensive in terms of computational resources .",
    "therefore we need to use an alternative method .",
    "our approach is to extract a 1 kpc by 1 kpc patch of the disk , extending 1  kpc both above and below the midplane , centered at a radial distance of 4.25  kpc from the galactic center ( see fig .",

    "these local simulations are able to reach higher densities , resolve smaller mass scales and include extra physics compared to the global simulations .",
    "setting up the local simulations requires performing a velocity transformation to remove the circular velocity at each location and then adding a shearing velocity field so that the reference frame of the simulation is the local standard of rest at the center of the extracted patch of the galaxy disk .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are introduced for the box faces perpendicular to the shear flow ( along the @xmath10-axis ) and outflow boundary conditions for the other faces .",
    "this set up is similar to shearing box simulations of astrophysical disks , but does not include the rotation of the frame of the patch ( thus neglecting coriolis forces ) . since we only consider the evolution of the ism over quite short timescales @xmath8  myr ( which is several local dynamical times of the gmcs , but much shorter than the orbital time of @xmath11  myr ) , this approximation should not have a significant effect on the properties of the clouds and their star formation activity .",
    "we also ignore radial gradients in the galactic potential , only including resulting forces perpendicular to the disk .",

    "note , however , that gravitational interactions between star cluster particles are thus softened to the resolution of the grid . in reality the distribution of stellar mass represented by the star cluster particle would be spread out , but by amounts that are not set by the local gas density .",

    "a similar observation was made by tt09 in their global simulation , i.e. the gas properties in the full disk are quasi - steady after timescales of about 150  myr .",

    "modeling these fast circular velocities on a finite rectilinear grid led to relatively large numerical viscous heating that helped stabilize the tt09 gmcs .",

    "the formation of clumps can also be seen in the pdfs ( see fig .  [",

    "the resulting cooling function resembles the atomic cooling function up to densities of 10@xmath38 cm@xmath22 , above which molecular species start to dominate the cooling rates",
    ". however , we need to keep in mind that the heating and cooling rates are only first order approximations as the extinction law is only a mean relation and as local abundance variations and time - dependent chemistry are not considered . furthermore the simulations do not take into account the local generation of fuv radiation from young star clusters .    with an increased resolution of @xmath144",
    "pc our simulations are able to capture a significant range of the internal structure of molecular clouds . while the global properties , such as the mass in the molecular clouds , remain the same , filaments and dense clumps form within the clouds shifting the mass distribution towards higher densities .",
    "the mass distribution within the molecular clouds are independent of the applied cooling function even though the three cooling functions describe different aspects of the thermal properties of the ism .",
    "this suggests that the thermal pressure is of minor importance within the gravitationally - bound clouds",
    ". then self - gravity and non - thermal motions determine the cloud structure .",
    "the nonthermal motions are driven by bulk cloud motions inherited by the gmcs that were formed and evolved in a shearing galactic disk where cloud - cloud collisions are frequent and influence gmc dynamics ( tt09 , @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations begin to resolve the cascade of the kinetic energy from these larger scales and processes down to the smaller scales of clumps in the gmcs .",
    "this approach is to be contrasted with the method of driving turbulence artificially in periodic box simulations of gmcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or of forming gmcs in large - scale converging flows of atomic gas where the turbulence is driven by thermal and dynamical instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of the gas within molecular clouds 50 - 60% is in dense clumps with @xmath166 .",
    "this value is much higher than observed in nearby gmcs , e.g. 90% of the clouds in the bolocam galactic plane survey have a ratio of clump mass to cloud mass , or clump formation efficiency , between 0 and 0.15 @xcite .",
    "the high clump formation efficiency is partly due to our resolution limit .",
    "we do not properly capture the formation of individual pscs . so that the turbulent dissipation range is not fully resolved .",
    "the clumps then lack turbulent support against self - gravity hereby attaining higher densities and accumulating more mass .",
    "the surface densities of the clumps in run 7 are in the range of @xmath20.1 to @xmath210  g  @xmath89 . galactic irdcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and star - forming clumps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are found in the range @xmath20.1 to a few g  @xmath89 .",
    "the most extreme mass surface density clumps seen in our simulations are probably prevented from forming in reality by localized feedback processes from star formation , especially the momentum input from protostellar outflows @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate in our simulations exceeds that expected from the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these authors find a close relation between the surface density of h@xmath85 and the star formation rate surface density for 1  kpc resolution regions within 31 disk galaxies . with a surface density of roughly 8  m@xmath162  pc@xmath163 in our simulations , the star formation rate of 0.3  m@xmath162  yr@xmath94  kpc@xmath163 after 10  myr is about 100 times higher than observed .",
    "this over efficiency of star formation in our simulations is a simple reflection of the high mass fraction in dense clumps : while the gmcs are globally stable , there is no support against free - fall collapse in local regions of the gmcs . we can identify two physical mechanisms of reducing this mass fraction : magnetic fields and stellar feedback . from @xcite",
    "we can estimate the critical magnetic field required for support against self - gravity ( neglecting the contribution of thermal and turbulent support ) , i.e. @xmath167 assuming that the clumps in a gmc condense out of local volumes of radius @xmath2 10  pc and a gmc density of @xmath168 , we find that a mean magnetic field of @xmath2 10  @xmath95 g is sufficient .",
    "this is similar to the observationally inferred value at this density @xcite .",
    "we will study the effect of magnetic support in a subsequent paper .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her comments that improved the paper , paola caselli and sam falle for useful discussions and elizabeth tasker for providing the initial conditions of our simulations .",
