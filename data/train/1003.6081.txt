    "martin , parodi , and pershan showed that the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry leads to eight hydrodynamic modes , one of which corresponds to defect diffusion @xcite .",
    "point defects , like vacancies and interstitials , are present in any equilibrium crystal and a complete microscopic theory of crystal dynamics needs to include them .",
    "interestingly , such a complete microscopic theory of real crystals was lacking and is developed in this contribution in the framework of linear response and correlation functions theory of broken symmetry phases .",
    "crystals exhibit long - range translational order and possess low - frequency goldstone modes , e.g.  transverse sound waves , which try to restore the broken symmetry . in the familiar microscopic description of ideal crystals ,",
    "the long - range order is incorporated at the start by assuming that the equilibrium positions of the particles are arranged in a perfect lattice .",
    "a one - to - one mapping follows between the particle @xmath0 and its lattice position @xmath1 .",
    "the deviation between the actual position @xmath2 and the lattice position @xmath3 is called displacement vector @xmath4 @xmath5 the ( symmetrized ) gradient tensor of the displacement vector field is connected to the strain tensor , which plays the central role in the theory of elasticity . yet , the applicability of the displacement vector is , due to the one - to - one mapping , restricted to perfect crystals , because an interstitial corresponds to a particle without lattice site ( fig .",

    "linear elasticity , considering small strain fields , thus would intrinsically be restricted to short times , contradicting / invalidating its application to low frequency vibrations .",
    "thus the need arises to define the displacement field microscopically without the recourse to a perfect lattice of equilibrium sites @xmath3 .    in an ideal crystal where the one - to - one mapping of particles to lattice positions holds ,",
    "a density change is given by the divergence of the displacement field @xcite @xmath6 with average density @xmath7 and obvious definition of @xmath8 ; note that it is a periodic lattice function in this case . above relation holds because the density can only fluctuate by particles moving around their lattice sites . in an ideal crystal ,",
    "density thus is not an independent degree of freedom , and description of the displacement field suffices . in a real crystal containing point defects ,",
    "translational symmetry is still broken and long range order exists , but the motion of defects decouples density fluctuations and the divergence of the displacement field . density not only changes because of a deformation of the lattice , given by @xmath9 , but also by motion of additional / missing particles from one lattice cell to another .",
    "the density can be decomposed in two parts : @xmath10 this definition of the defect density @xmath11 is positive for vacancies , and negative for interstitials , i.e. the conventional sign favors the interpretation as a vacancy density .",
    "comparison with the discussion in [ ] for vacancies as the only point defects shows , that the thus defined variation in defect density is given in terms of number of vacancies @xmath12 and number of lattice sites @xmath13 @xmath14 thus , the magnitude of the variation of vacancy density increases , if there are more vacancies , and decreases , if there are more lattice sites .",

    "yet , there exists no microscopic particle based theory , which provides the definitions of the displacement and defect density fields , and recovers eq .   from first principles .",
    "we will present these definitions and derive the equations of motion for the fields , which reduce to the continuum description in the hydrodynamic limit .",

    "importantly , the new expression for @xmath15 can thus be used for both ideal and real crystals , either by simulation or , experimentally , by optical techniques in e.g.  colloidal crystals . because we have a systematic way to discover the hydrodynamic fields and their equations",
    ", we can correct the work by szamel and ernst and achieve consistency with the phenomenological description , which these authors could not @xcite .",

    "an example of such a potential is an external wall , which in thermal equilibrium would need to be placed such that @xmath13 crystal lattice sites fit into the volume without externally applied macroscopic strain or stress ; here @xmath13 differs from @xmath17 because of point defects like vacancies and interstitials .",
