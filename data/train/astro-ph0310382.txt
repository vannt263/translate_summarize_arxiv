    "the recently released wmap data  @xcite have confirmed the standard paradigm of adiabatic scale invariant primordial fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this paradigm can be justified in the framework of inflation and can explain the most important cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "this remarkable success has led the cosmologists to take an interest in more subtle features of the wmap multipole moments .",
    "in particular , recently , many studies have been devoted to the so - called cosmic variance outliers , i.e. points which lie outside the one sigma cosmic variance error  @xcite .",
    "these outliers have been considered as intriguing since the probability for their presence would be very small  @xcite .",
    "so far , all the studies have concentrated on the seeming lack of power at large scales , i.e. on the quadrupole and the octupole outliers . in the literature ,",
    "two possibilities have been envisaged . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that the outliers are not a problem at all , the crucial point being the way the probability of their presence is estimated . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been envisaged that the outliers could be a signature of new physics even if it has also been recognized in these articles that the cosmic variance could be responsible for their presence . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proposed that the inflationary scale invariant initial power spectrum could be modified by some new physics such that a sharp cut - off at large scales appears while it remains unchanged elsewhere .",
    "it has been shown that this can cause a decrease of the @xmath2 of order @xmath3 for one additional free parameter given by the scale of the cut - off .    however , as revealed by the fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the main contribution to the wmap @xmath2 does not come from the large scales but rather from scales which correspond to the first and second doppler peaks ( more precisely , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the three main contributions come from the angular scales @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . in other words , if the presence of outliers is taken seriously into account , modifications of the standard power spectrum seem to be required on a different range of scales and , in any case , not only at very large scales .",
    "in addition , the small scale outliers can be above or below the theoretical error bar and , therefore , the required modifications do not seem to have the form of a systematic lack or excess of power .",
    "this naturally leads to the idea that the power spectrum could possess superimposed oscillations .",
    "the aim of this article is to study whether this idea has any statistical support .",
    "of course , a physical justification for the presence of oscillations in the power spectrum is needed .",
    "interestingly enough , such a justification exists precisely in the context of the theory of inflation  @xcite and we now discuss this question in more details .",
    "one of the main advantage of the inflationary scenario is that it permits to fix sensible initial conditions . because the hubble radius was constant during inflation , the wavelength of a mode of astrophysical interest today was much smaller than the hubble scale at the beginning of inflation",
    "whereas , without a phase of inflation , the same mode would have been a super - hubble mode .",
    "contrary to the super - hubble case , the vacuum is defined without ambiguity in the sub - hubble regime .",
    "this state is the starting point of the subsequent cosmological perturbations evolution .",
    "this leads to a nearly scale - invariant spectrum for density perturbations , a prediction which is now confirmed to a high level of accuracy  @xcite .    however , this remarkable success carries in itself a potential problem . in a typical model of inflation ,",
    "the modes are initially not only sub - hubble but also sub - planckian , that is to say their wavelength is smaller than the planck length @xmath6  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the physical principles which underlie the calculations of the power spectrum are likely not to be valid anymore .",
    "this problem is specific to the perturbative approach and does not affect the background model . indeed , since the energy density of the inflaton field is nearly constant during inflation , we face in fact a situation where the wavelength of the fourier modes is smaller than the planck length whereas the energy density which drives inflation can still be well below the planck energy density . the problem described above",
    "mainly concerns the modes of cosmological ( still in the linear regime ) interest today which are , in the inflationary paradigm , a pure relic of the trans - planckian regime .",
    "it should be added that the scale at which the new physics shows up is not necessarily the planck length but could be everywhere between this scale and the hubble radius . in this article",
    "we denote the new energy scale @xmath7 and assume that @xmath8 is a free parameter ( @xmath9 denotes the hubble parameter during inflation ) .",
    "if the physics is different beyond the scale @xmath7 , this should leave some imprints on the spectrum of inflationary cosmological perturbations and therefore modify the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "the next question is how to calculate these modifications . roughly speaking",
    ", the calculation of the power spectrum of the fluctuations reduces to the calculation of the evolution of a free quantum scalar field in a time - dependent background .",
    "various methods have been used to model the physics beyond @xmath7 like changing the free dispersion relation  @xcite , using stringy uncertainty relations  @xcite or noncommutative geometry  @xcite .",
    "yet another approach has been to assume that the fourier modes are `` created '' when their wavelength equals the critical scale @xmath10  @xcite . a generic prediction , first made in refs .",
    "@xcite , which appears to be independent of the settings used to model the new physics , is the presence of oscillations in the power spectrum ( of course , the detailed properties of these oscillations do depend on the model utilized ) .",
    "this can be understood easily . in the standard calculation , initially , the scalar field is just given by an in - going wave .",
    "if the evolution proceeds according to the wkb approximation  @xcite , at hubble scale exit the scalar field will just differ by a phase which will drop out when the power spectrum is calculated . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wkb approximation is violated at some time before hubble scale exit or if the modes are created at a fixed length in some @xmath11-vacuum , then the scalar field will be a combination of on - going and out - going waves .",
    "this combination gives the oscillations in the power spectrum .",
    "to put it differently , one can say that the existence of a preferred scale plus the standard inflationary theory generically imply a power spectrum given by a nearly scale invariant component plus superimposed oscillations .",
    "the aim of this article is to use the previous generic trans - planckian prediction as a tool to analyze whether the wmap multipole moments exhibit oscillations originating from oscillations in the primordial spectrum .",
    "it should be stressed again that , in this work , the trans - planckian effects are only considered as an example of models where oscillations could show up . indeed , the analysis presented in this article would still be useful for any alternative model which predicts a similar oscillatory pattern .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly recall the standard calculation of the inflationary spectrum when the trans - planckian effects are taken into account . in sect .",
    "[ sect : cmb ] , we compare the theoretical predictions with the wmap data .",
    "finally , we discuss the data analysis and give our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ sect : end ] .",
    "in this article , we assume that inflation of the spatially flat flrw spacetime is driven by a single scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "scalar perturbations of the geometry can be characterized by the gauge - invariant bardeen potentials @xmath13 and fluctuations in the scalar field are characterized by the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 ( a prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath16 ) , then everything can be reduced to the study of a single gauge - invariant variable ( the so - called mukhanov - sasaki variable ) defined by @xcite @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the conformal hubble parameter .",
    "in fact , it turns out to be more convenient to work with the variable @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "density perturbations are often characterized by the so - called conserved quantity @xmath22  @xcite defined by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the equation of state parameter . the quantity @xmath19 is related to @xmath25 by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 . on the other hand , the primordial gravitational waves are described by the transverse and traceless tensor @xmath28 , the fourier transform of which is @xmath29 ( up to a polarization tensor ) .",
    "both types of perturbations obey the same type of equation of motion , namely the equation of a parametric oscillator  @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the wavenumber of a given fourier mode .",
    "finally , the quantities of interest for computing the cmb anisotropies are the power spectra which read  @xcite @xmath34 in order to compute @xmath35 and @xmath36 , one must integrate the equation of motion ( [ eq : evol ] ) and specify what the initial conditions are .",
    "the integration of the equations of motion is possible for a large class of inflationary models provided they satisfy the slow - roll conditions  @xcite .",
    "the slow - roll approximation is controlled by a set of parameters given by @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the slow - roll conditions are satisfied if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are much smaller than one and if @xmath42 . at first order , the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be considered as constant .    here",
    ", the initial conditions are fixed under the assumption that the fourier modes never penetrate the trans - planckian region .",
    "in other words , a fourier mode is supposed to `` appear '' when its wavelength becomes equal to a new fundamental characteristic scale @xmath45 .",
    "the time @xmath46 of mode `` appearance '' with comoving wavenumber @xmath33 , can be computed from the condition @xmath47 which implies that @xmath46 is a function of @xmath33 .",
    "this has to be compared with the standard inflationary calculations where the initial time is taken to be @xmath48 for any fourier mode @xmath33 and where , in a certain sense , the initial time does not depend on @xmath33 ( see , however , ref .",

    "the multipole moments @xmath97 are given by the convolution of a spherical bessel function with the initial power spectrum [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : largescale ] ) ] .",
    "it is therefore not obvious that the oscillations in the primordial spectra will be transferred into oscillations in the multipole moments . as shown in ref .",

    "although this equation is not specially illuminating , we can already conclude that , due to the presence of the euler functions with complex arguments , the oscillations are indeed passed to the multipole moments .",
    "this is already an important conclusion since this means that the oscillations in the primordial power spectrum are not killed by the convolution . in the limit @xmath116",

    "therefore , in practice , we expect the oscillations to appear only at relatively small scales and to be absent at large angular scales . of course , at large @xmath88 , or for not too small values of @xmath61 , the above equation quickly becomes invalid and an accurate estimation can be made only with the help of numerical calculations .",
    "these computations are not trivial and require the ` camb ` accuracy to be increased in order to correctly transfer the superimposed oscillations in the power spectra to the multipole moments .",
    "indeed , the ` camb ` default computation target accuracy of @xmath121 for the scalars is only valid for non - extreme models .",
    "since we precisely consider fine structures in the power spectra , the corresponding models do not enter into this class and modifications in the default values of the ` camb ` code parameters are therefore required for small values of @xmath122 . without these modifications ( i.e. with the default accuracy ) , random structures in the multipole moments were found to appear at large scales for models with @xmath123 .",
    "the modified accuracy of the code has been chosen such that it allows to treat models with sufficiently small values of @xmath60 ( in practice , up to @xmath124 ) and to avoid prohibitive computation time .",

    "the remaining oscillations are even washed out at small @xmath88 and only show up at the rise of the first acoustic peak .",
    "we also notice a similar behavior for @xmath82 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cls ] ) .     and for an amplitude of @xmath128 .",
    "a strong damping of the oscillations is observed at large angular scales.,width=362 ]    having checked that the numerical calculations are well under control , one can now move to parameters estimation .",
    "the main result of this article is that , with the oscillations taken into account , it is possible to decrease the @xmath2 significantly .",
    "the best fit that has been found by ` cosmomc ` and the result of its markov chains exploration of the parameter space is summarized in table  [ tbl : bestfit ] .",

    "the corresponding multipole moments @xmath97 and @xmath82 together with the wmap data are represented in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] .",
    "the reason for such an important improvement of the @xmath2 is clear from these figures : the presence of the oscillations allows a better fit of the cosmic variance outliers at small scales .        in order to make this statement more quantitative ,",
    "the difference between the cumulative @xmath132 with and without the oscillations ( in this last case this is nothing but the wmap cumulative @xmath2 ) has been plotted in fig .",

    "the final @xmath133 improvement is of order @xmath134.,width=362 ]    this permits a direct comparison with the fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite . clearly , the significant decrease of the @xmath132 comes from the outliers around the first acoustic peak which are well fitted by the oscillating component of our initial power spectra .",
    "notice also that the outliers at large scales , @xmath135 , can not be well fitted in this model due to the strong damping described above [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : largescalestpl ] ) ] .",
    "but , as already mentioned several times , this is not a problem since the outliers that contributes the most to the @xmath2 are not located at large scales but around the first acoustic peak .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us remark that we have not given confidence values for the best fit model parameters in table  [ tbl : bestfit ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the high - accuracy ` camb ` version , which is necessary to obtain physical results when the oscillations are included , takes a few minutes to compute only one model instead of a few seconds in the standard inflationary case .",
    "although minima in the @xmath132 hypersurface can be `` rapidly '' found with ` cosmomc ` , the markov chains take a much longer time to scan the `` one - sigma '' neighborhood . in addition , as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the likelihood function looks like a hedgehog in the parameters space forbidding a smooth convergence of the markov chains around a given @xmath132 minimum .",
    "given the previous result , @xmath136 , the first question that one may ask is whether the improvement is statistically significant ?",
    "we have introduced two new parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath56 , and one may wonder whether it was worth it , given the decrease observed in the @xmath2 . indeed , it could just be due to statistical fluctuations in the larger parameters space . since it is not possible to directly compare the @xmath2 of models with different degrees of freedom , i.e. with different number of parameters , we need another reliable statistical test .",
    "test  @xcite is an efficient tool to deal with this problem .",
    "this test works as follows .",
    "given a first fit with @xmath137 degrees of freedom and with a @xmath138 and a second fit with @xmath139 degrees of freedom and a new @xmath140 , the f  test gives the probability that the decrease in the @xmath2 is only due to statistical fluctuations and not to the fact that the underlying model is actually a better fit .",
    "generally , one considers that the improvement is significant if this probability is less than a few @xmath141 . for our case ,",
    "the f  probability is f@xmath142 .",
    "a possible loophole would be that , since the f  test is only valid for gaussian statistics , it could not be applied to the case at hand since the multipole moments obey a different statistics .",
    "however , since our result comes from relatively small scales , the central limit theorem applies and the statistics should not deviate too much from the gaussian one .",
    "therefore , we expect the f  test to give a rather fair estimate .",
    "another test has been to check that a spectrum with a different oscillatory pattern , e.g. with a @xmath33-dependence instead of @xmath143 in the cosine function , does not provides us with a fit as good as the trans - planckian one , in the f  test sense and for a same amount of computed models with ` cosmomc ` .",
    "this is indeed the case since we have found @xmath144 only ( with two new parameters ) which is not very statistically significant .",
    "let us now analyze and discuss the result itself in more details .",
    "the first remark is that the baryons contribution is standard since we have @xmath145 .",
    "it is therefore compatible with big bang nucleosynthesis even if this is slightly less compatible than the value obtained without oscillations but this difference does not seem to be significant . in the same way ,",
    "the value of @xmath146 is not significantly modified compared to the standard one .",
    "the same is true for the energy scale of inflation , i.e. for @xmath104 . on the other hand",
    ", we see that the value of @xmath147 is particularly high , as the values of @xmath99 and the optical depth are .",
    "however , this still seems to be admissible , in particular with the snia measurements .",
    "however , the slow - roll parameters differ significantly compared to their standard values  @xcite and , as a consequence , the spectral index is modified .",
    "this is not surprising and should even be expected : since the trans - planckian parameters seem to be as statistically significant as the slow - roll ones , their inclusion in the best fit search should have an effect on the determination of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "the fact that the best fit cosmological parameters with or without oscillations are not exactly the same illustrates the fact that the determination of these cosmological parameters depends on the shape of the primordial power spectra  @xcite .",
    "let us now study the trans - planckian parameters in more details .",
    "first of all , we see that the best fit is such that the preferred scale @xmath7 is almost four orders of magnitude higher than the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "however , this does not provide us with a measure of @xmath7 since the energy scale of inflation can not be deduced directly from the data .",
    "nevertheless , a constraint on @xmath9 has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite and leads to @xmath148 . on the other hand , from table  [ tbl : bestfit ]",
    ", one obtains that @xmath149 .",
    "this means that the trans - planckian amplitude , @xmath150 , is not compatible with the requirement of negligible backreaction effects [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : brvalid ] ) ] .",
    "this is certainly a major difficulty not for the presence of oscillations in the multipole moments ( since we have proven that this is statistically significant anyway ) but rather for the physical interpretation of those oscillations in terms of trans - planckian physics .",
    "at this point , two remarks are in order .",
    "first , the previous calculation does not predict what the modifications coming from the inclusion of the backreaction effects are and , in particular , it does not tell that the backreaction effects will modify the power spectra .",
    "it just signals when the backreaction effects must be taken into account .",
    "therefore , despite the fact that we are not able to prove it , it could very well be that the backreaction effects do not modify the @xmath33-dependence of the oscillations ( for instance , it could only renormalize the values of the trans - planckian parameters ) .",
    "clearly , this is a very difficult technical question since a check of the above speculation would require a calculation at second order in the framework of the relativistic theory of cosmological perturbations with the trans - planckian effects taken into account .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "secondly , the physical origin of the oscillations could be different .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , initial power spectra with oscillations were also found but with different physical justifications . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of the oscillations is due to non - standard initial conditions in the framework of hybrid inflation , while in ref .",
    "@xcite a sudden transition during inflation is involved .",
    "of course , it remains to be proven that a different model could produce an oscillatory pattern similar to the trans - planckian one but since , on a purely phenomenological level , it seems that the significant increase of the likelihood requires superimposed oscillation in the initial power spectra , this is a question that is certainly worth studying .",
    "let us also signal that a primordial bouncing phase , as described for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , may also do the job .",
    "finally , let us remind that the main goal of the paper was to study whether the idea that oscillations are present in the wmap data can be statistically demonstrated and that the trans - planckian power spectra used before were just one possible example .",
    "as a conclusion , a word of caution is in order . from the previous considerations , it is clear that , in the absence of outliers around the first acoustic peak , there would be no reason , in the f  test sense , to include oscillations with a large amplitude ( i.e. @xmath151 ) in the power spectra .",
    "therefore , the future wmap data release will be extremely important to check whether the presence of these outliers is confirmed or if they are just observational artifacts .",
    "however , if the last possibility turns out to be true , it is clear that it would still be worth looking for small trans - planckian effects ( i.e. @xmath75 ) in the future very high - accuracy planck data and the ideas put forward in the present article would still be useful for this purpose .",

    "<S> the possibility that the cosmic variance outliers present in the recently released wmap multipole moments are due to oscillations in the primordial power spectrum is investigated . since the most important contribution to the wmap likelihood originates from the outliers at relatively small angular scale ( around the first doppler peak ) , special attention is paid to these in contrast with previous studies on the subject which have concentrated on the large scales outliers only ( i.e. the quadrupole and octupole ) . as a physically motivated example , the case where the oscillations are of trans - planckian origin is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the presence of the oscillations causes an important drop in the wmap @xmath0 of about fifteen . </S>",
    "<S> the f - test reveals that such a drop has a probability less than @xmath1 to occur by chance and can therefore be considered as statistically significant . </S>"
