    "the universe acceleration , shown by several astronomical observations , indicates the existence of a mysterious exotic matter called dark energy ( de ) @xcite . in the classical gravity , whereas the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , is the most prominent candidate of de with the equation of state ( eos ) parameter equals -1 @xcite , there are strong evidence for a dynamical de equation of state .",
    "however , the problem of de @xcite , its energy density and eos parameter is still an unsolved problem in classical gravity and may be in the context of quantum gravity we achieve a more inclusive insight to its properties @xcite .    while in the microscopic level , the einstein s theory of gravity still remains unclear , the authors in @xcite obtain the first law of thermodynamics for black holes .",
    "later , padmanabhan proposes a thermodynamic interpretation of gravity @xcite .",
    "recently , explanation of gravity as entropic force is pointed out by verlinde @xcite in several models such as specific microscopic model of space - time @xcite , construction of holography from black hole entropy @xcite and quantum information theories @xcite . in addition , a modified entropic force in the debye model is presented in ref .",
    "for other relevant works in entropic force , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", the holographic principle is discussed in details by several authors @xcite . in @xcite , it has been shown that the holographic dark energy can be derived from the entropic force .",
    "the correspondence between entropy  corrected holographic and gauss  bonnet dark energy models is discussed is @xcite . here , we intend to investigate the correspondence between logarithmic entropy  corrected holographic and cosmological models with kinetic terms coupled non  minimally to the scalar field and to the curvature @xcite as a source of dark energy @xcite . the initial motivation to study such theories",
    "is related to low energy limit of several higher dimensional theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ 2 ] , we review the scalar - tensor theories with non  minimally coupled kinetic terms to the curvature and the scalar field .",
    "we will obtain the field equations and energy  momentum tensors . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we introduce the basic setup of the echde and obtain the corresponding eos parameter for further investigation . in section",
    "[ 4 ] , the correspondence between echde and non - minimal kinetic coupling term and acceleration of the universe are presented .",
    "a short summary is given in section [ 5 ] .",
    "the standard frw cosmological is given by the metric , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is scale factor and @xmath3 imply the flat , close and open universe respectively .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid is given by @xmath4 diag(@xmath5 .",
    "the friedmann equations then are , @xmath6 we start with a cosmological model in which there is an interaction between a scalar field and the curvature @xcite @xmath7 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coupling constants of dimensionless @xmath8 and @xmath9 are kinetic coupling and depend on the type of function @xmath10 .",
    "+ thus , by taking variation of action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric , we have , @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 .",
    "+ the @xmath13 is the energy - momentum tensor for the scalar field @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy - momentum tensor for the minimally coupling @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "so , the corresponding energy - momentum tensors are , @xmath17 @xmath18 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to obtain the equation of motion for the scalar field , we take variation of action with respect to @xmath14 , so we have , @xmath20+\\frac{dv}{d\\phi}+\\\\ & \\frac{df}{d\\phi}\\left(\\xi r\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi+\\eta r_{\\mu\\nu}\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\nu}\\phi\\right)=0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity we assume that @xmath21 = 0 .",
    "therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ tphi])-([teta ] ) , the energy density , pressure and the scalar field equation are given by , @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24",
    "the black hole entropy plays a central role in the derivation of holographic dark energy ( hde ) . indeed , the definition and derivation of holographic energy density depends on the entropy - area relationship @xmath25 of black holes in einstein s gravity , where @xmath26 represents the area of the horizon .",
    "however , this definition can be modified from the inclusion of quantum effects , motivated from the loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "the quantum corrections provided to the entropy - area relationship leads to the curvature correction in the einstein - hilbert action and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the corrected entropy takes the form @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are dimensionless constants of order unity .",
    "the exact values of these constants are not yet determined and are still debatable in lqc .",
    "the corrections are due to thermal equilibrium and quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the second term in ( [ entropy ] ) appears in a model of entropic cosmology which unifies the inflation and late time acceleration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 might be extremely large due to current cosmological constraint , which inevitably brought a fine tuning problem to entropy corrected models and it is desirable to determine it by observational constrain . taking the corrected entropy - area relation ( [ entropy ] ) into account , the energy density of the hde will be modified as well . on this basis , wei @xcite proposed the energy density of the so - called echde in the form @xmath31 in units where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a constant determined by observational fit .",
    "the future event horizon @xmath34 is defined as , @xmath35 which leads to results compatible with observations .",
    "furthermore , we can define the dimensionless dark energy as : @xmath36 in the case of a dark - energy dominated universe , dark energy evolves according to the conservation law , @xmath37 or equivalently @xmath38,\\ ] ] therefore the eos parameter reduce to , @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] +",
    "here we obtain the conditions for correspondence between our cosmological model with the non  minimal kinetic term and the echde scenario in the flat frw space .",
    "this can be achieved by obtaining an appropriate potential in the model . in the following we make two assumptions @xcite , + 1 )",
    "the function @xmath10 is in exponential form as , @xmath40 and + 2 ) the scalar factor is in power laws as @xmath41 , @xcite . for negative @xmath42",
    ", the scale factor does not correspond to expanding universe but to shrinking one . if one changes the direction of time as @xmath43 , the expanding universe whose scale factor is given by @xmath44 emerges .",
    "we note that when @xmath45 arrives @xmath46 occurs a big rip singularity , so this is an important scenario in relation with other cosmological singularities @xcite .",
    "since @xmath42 is not an integer in general , the sign of @xmath45 is still a problem . to avoid the inconsistency , we may further shift the origin of the time as @xmath47 . then the time @xmath45 can be positive as long as @xmath48 , and we can consistently take @xmath49 .",
    "so that , we can finally write scalar field as ref . @xcite in the following form , @xmath50 when @xmath51 or @xmath52 when @xmath53 . here",
    "we first consider @xmath54 .",
    "if we establish a correspondence between the holographic dark energy and non  minimal coupling approach , then by using dark energy density equation ( [ rho ] ) and relation ( [ omega ] ) , together with expressions ( [ n ] ) , we easily arrive to the scalar potential as , @xmath55 the equations ( [ n ] ) help us to obtain @xmath45 in terms of the scalar field @xmath14 .",
    "therefor , by substituting ( [ fphi ] ) , ( [ n ] ) , and ( [ vphi ] ) into ( [ eqmotion ] ) , finally we have following equation , @xmath56 where @xmath57 in order to have finite @xmath34 , we consider the ansatz @xmath41 for @xmath58 and substitute into equation ( [ rh ] ) , we then find : @xmath59 @xmath60,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath61.\\label{wh0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",
    "+ for @xmath63 , we repeat the process , but impose relations ( [ h01 ] ) .",
    "so , we find that , @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 now , under the ansatz @xmath49 we can see from ( [ rh ] ) that @xmath34 is always finite if @xmath63 , which is just the case under investigation",
    ". then we have : @xmath67 @xmath68,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath61.\\label{wh0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phantom crossing then occurs for the eos parameter of the echde model in the following scenario @xcite : @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72     in terms of time evolution by choosing @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . ]     in terms of time evolution by choosing @xmath77 , @xmath74 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . ]",
    "using numerical calculation , the eos parameter for both positive and negative @xmath42 are given in the figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "also we can see in both cases with different eos parameters which the phantom crossing occurs .",
    "in this paper we started with scalar tensor theories with the non  minimal kinetic coupling to gravity and obtained the corresponding field equations , energy density and pressure .",
    "we introduced the logarithmic entropy  corrected holographic energy density as a dynamical cosmological constant . in order to obtain the cosmological parameters , we need to explicitly define the function @xmath10 .",
    "the popular exponential form is chosen with the motivation to produce phantom crossing behavior in formalism .",
    "+ we obtained different conditions in order to have a correspondence between entropy  corrected holographic and non - minimal kinetic coupling dark energy model .",
    "also we reconstructed potential in terms of field @xmath14 for two cases @xmath81 and @xmath53 .",
    "finally we obtained the eos parameter for the holographic energy density in the model with the condition for phantom crossing scenario given by ( [ c1])-([c4 ] ) .",
