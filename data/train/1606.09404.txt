    "we use a double odt system that can produce a deep odt and a stable odt @xcite .",
    "the light source of this double odt system is a multimode ytterbium fiber laser with a maximum output power of 200  w , a center wavelength of 1070  nm , and a line width of 3  nm .",
    "the output is divided into two optical paths .",

    "they are orthogonally polarized relative to each other to avoid interference at their intersection .",
    "the finite incident angles of @xmath16 = 16@xmath17 and @xmath18 = 5@xmath17 are chosen in order to prevent back reflections inside the glass cell from returning to the trapping region .",
    "the glass cell is made from anhydrous quartz to reduce thermal lens effects caused by the high - power laser odt .",
    "the laser power of the lp - odt is stabilized by monitoring the power after the glass cell and feeding the error signal back to the lp - aom .",

    "we collected 2@xmath1010@xmath25 @xmath0li atoms and 2@xmath1010@xmath25 @xmath1li in the simultaneous mot within 30  s. we loaded them into the hp - odt by further cooling and compressing in a compressed - mot ( cmot ) for 45  ms . during the cmot process",

    "@xmath0li atoms are populated in the two magnetic sublevels of the lowest hyperfine state @xmath26 , and @xmath1li atoms are populated in the three magnetic sublevels of the @xmath27 state . at this magnetic field , fermions have a diverging scattering length of @xmath28 for collisions between the two states @xcite , and bosons have @xmath29 for @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the scattering length of @xmath33 for @xmath34 is unknown . in this experiment",
    ", we do not consider the scattering length between different internal states of the bosons , because we choose one of these internal states in the process of evaporative cooling .",
    "the scattering lengths between bosons and fermions have almost the same values of @xmath35 for all the combinations of internal states @xcite . since @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39",
    ", fermions can be cooled more efficiently than bosons by evaporative cooling .",
    "thus , bosons can be cooled by thermal contact with cooled fermions , namely , by sympathetic cooling .",
    "this process is the reverse of the sympathetic cooling of fermions by bosons @xcite .",
    "evaporative cooling was performed in the double odt system .",
    "first , the trap depth of the hp - odt was lowered from 2.8  mk to 560  @xmath14k for a period of @xmath40 by decreasing the output laser power of the fiber laser from 160  w to 33  w , which changes the power inside the glass cell from 100  w to 20  w. we then applied a radio - frequency magnetic pulse for 300  ms to @xmath0li with a resonant frequency between the two magnetic sublevels of @xmath41 in order to populate them equally and maximize the efficiency of evaporative cooling .",
    "the @xmath42 state of @xmath1li disappeared during evaporative cooling owing to inelastic collisions among the bosons at this magnetic field , leaving the stable internal states @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we prepared one of these internal states by applying a blower laser pulse to @xmath1li atoms for 50  @xmath14s with a frequency tuned to @xmath43 or @xmath44 to remove them selectively from the trap .",
    "after the state preparation process , we turned on the lp - odt with a depth of 38  @xmath14k ( 2  w ) and produced a crossed - odt at the intersection of the hp - odt and lp - odt and gradually turned off the hp - odt for a period of @xmath45 . during this step ,",
    "atoms were cooled and transferred into the stable lp - odt .",
    "they were finally cooled by lowering the trap depth down to 850  nk ( 45  mw ) for a period of @xmath46 and held for a period of @xmath47 until they reached thermal equilibrium .",
    "the final trap has trapping frequencies of @xmath48  hz and @xmath49  hz for @xmath0li in the radial and axial directions , respectively .",
    "the frequencies for @xmath1li were obtained by multiplying those for @xmath0li by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the final state of the bose - fermi mixture was examined by measuring the momentum distributions of the paired fermions and the bosons .",
    "we turned off the lp - odt and the bias magnetic field simultaneously ( within 10  @xmath14s of each other ) .",
    "after the @xmath1li atoms expanded ballistically during 8  ms of the time of flight ( tof ) , the probe laser beam was applied for absorption imaging . in contrast , the paired fermions of @xmath0li atoms were converted into molecules when the magnetic field was turned off @xcite , and those molecules expanded with the original center - of - mass momentum distribution of the paired fermions .",
    "although unpaired fermions also expanded as atoms or as randomly associated molecules , they exhibited a thermal distribution .",
    "therefore , macroscopic occupation at the zero momentum state in the molecules suggested the existence of condensate paired fermions in the fermi system before the magnetic field was turned off @xcite . instead of imaging the molecules",
    "directly , they were dissociated into atoms by applying a magnetic pulse with a larger peak than the resonant magnetic field strength of the feshbach resonance . in this way",
