    "currently there is much interest to determine the total @xmath6 meson production cross section in nucleon - nucleon reactions near threshold .",
    "this cross section is of particular importance in heavy - ion physics . in heavy ion collisions",
    "it has been observed that the inclusive production cross sections for @xmath6 and @xmath5 mesons are nearly equal in sub ",
    "threshold reactions when measured at the same energy per nucleon below the production thresholds for the reactions @xmath7 and @xmath8x , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this result is surprising for several reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath6 production cross section in near  threshold proton ",
    "proton reactions is expected  @xcite to be lower by over an order of magnitude than the @xmath5 cross section at the same distance from their respective thresholds .",
    "second , antikaons ( @xmath6 , @xmath9 ) should have a higher absorption probability in heavy ion collisions than kaons ( @xmath5 , @xmath10 ) , primarily as a result of strangeness exchange reactions ( e.g. @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) .",
    "although charge exchange reactions ( e.g. @xmath13 ) may occur , changes to the observed yield of a particular charge state will be largely compensated by the corresponding reverse process . in this context",
    "it has been shown in detailed model calculations that multi - step processes can not explain the enhanced @xmath6 yield in heavy ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "a promising explanation of this discrepancy comes from various theoretical models  @xcite which suggest that , as a result of partial chiral symmetry restoration in a dense hadronic medium , antikaons are subject to strongly attractive , and kaons to slightly repulsive , forces .",
    "these effective interactions would lower the apparent @xmath6 production threshold in a dense hadronic medium , and thus enhance the @xmath6 yield in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , the comparison of heavy ion with nucleon - nucleon collisions has relied on some assumptions because , in the latter case , the antikaon data were either deduced from @xmath14 results , or taken as the sum of different exclusive channels with one or two pions in the final state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , apart from a preliminary upper limit  @xcite , there is a lack of pp antikaon production data in the regime of available energy most relevant in near  threshold heavy ion collisions ( i.e. @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the threshold of the particular channel under consideration )  @xcite .",
    "the result presented in this work represents the first cross section determination of the exclusive channel @xmath17 , and is equivalent to the inclusive @xmath6 production cross section since no other purely hadronic channels including @xmath6 are kinematically allowed at the beam momentum of this experiment ( i.e. @xmath18 ) .",
    "a proton beam from the saturne proton synchrotron with momentum @xmath19 was directed onto a liquid hydrogen target of 2  cm length .",
    "all events with at least four charged particles in the final state were measured with the disto spectrometer , which is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "charged particles were tracked through a magnetic spectrometer which consisted of a dipole magnet ( @xmath20 ) , two sets of scintillating fiber hodoscopes inside the field and 2 sets of multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) outside the field .",
    "furthermore , two arrays of scintillator hodoscopes and water erenkov detectors were located behind the mwpcs .",
    "particle identification was performed using the correlation between the particle momenta and the erenkov light output ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the large acceptance of the spectrometer ( @xmath21 vertical , @xmath22 horizontal in the laboratory reference frame ) guarantees a sizeable efficiency for coincident detection of four charged particles .",
    "the measurement of all particles in the final state allowed 4-momentum conservation to be used in addition to particle identification for effective background suppression in order to identify the @xmath23 final state .",
    "since the 4-momenta of all particles in the final state were measured , the events are kinematically over  determined .",
    "therefore , 4-momentum conservation can be used for a substantial background suppression by requiring that the proton - proton missing mass ( @xmath24 ) be equal to the @xmath25 invariant mass ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath27 is plotted in figure  [ fig : i - m ] .",
    "the peak near @xmath28 results from events where the @xmath23 event hypothesis was correct , and is the basis for the cross section values quoted below .",
    "this peak is superimposed on a background resulting from imperfect @xmath29 separation in the erenkov detectors in a small fraction of events of the type @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "an estimate of the background underneath the @xmath23 peak is given by the solid curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : i - m ] .",
    "this estimate was determined by scaling the @xmath27 distribution , measured for all events before requiring kaon identification , by a factor 0.002 in order to match the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - m ] above @xmath32 . from this histogram",
    "it is determined that the background accounts for about 13% of the yield in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - m ] with @xmath33 .",
    "this background has been subtracted in the subsequent analysis as described below . to extract a total cross section from the data shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : i - m ] , a correction for the detector acceptance and an absolute normalization must also be determined .",
    "the correction of the measured yields for the detector acceptance has been evaluated by means of monte carlo simulations , which after digitization of the simulated detector hits , were processed through the same analysis chain as the measured data .",
    "the detector acceptance was determined as a multi - dimensional function of the relevant kinematic degrees of freedom of the particles in the final state . after accounting for the azimuthal and reflection symmetries ,",
    "the detector acceptance was non - zero over the full kinematically allowed region .",
    "thus , the acceptance correction is essentially independent of the actual phase space distribution of the final state , and has been determined assuming a uniform phase space distribution in the simulations .",
    "this has been verified by calculating the acceptance correction matrix using different initial distributions in the simulations , and observing that the measured yield varied less than the systematic error associated to the acceptance correction .",
    "although eight linearly independent degrees of freedom are in principle required to fully describe the @xmath34 reaction , a five dimensional acceptance correction matrix is sufficient , in part because the cross section can not depend upon the azimuthal orientation of the event .",
    "furthermore , we have compared the observed angular distribution of the @xmath35 decay with that from simulations .",
    "the comparison of data with simulations has a @xmath36 for a s - wave distribution and a @xmath37 for a p - wave distribution .",
    "therefore , in the simulations uniform distributions with respect to these three angular variables were integrated over when determining the acceptance as a function of the remaining five variables .",
    "finally , the raw data were corrected on an event - by - event basis , via a weighting factor determined from the simulated acceptance function for the appropriate kinematic bin .",
    "since the acceptance varies as a function of the kinematic distribution of the final state , one can not simply reduce the acceptance to a single number without making assumptions about the phase space distribution of the particles in the final state .",
    "nevertheless , a reasonable estimate of the average acceptance can be determined for kaon pairs with an invariant mass equal to the phi meson mass ( where most of the measured kaon pairs are observed ) and an isotropic distribution in the other kinematic variables . in this case",
    "the product of the geometrical acceptance times the tracking reconstruction efficiency is 21.4% .",
    "the background contribution from non-@xmath23 events , shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - m ] , must be subtracted from the data in order to determine the @xmath25 yield .",
    "the subtraction was performed on the @xmath26 distribution .",
    "for this , the @xmath26 distribution for the background events was determined by applying the acceptance correction matrix ( determined for simulated @xmath38 reactions ) to events subjected to the same kinematic requirement @xmath33 , but not to the kaon identification conditions with the erenkov detectors .",
    "the resulting distribution was scaled by the same factor ( 0.002 ) used by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - m ] , and then subtracted from the acceptance corrected @xmath26 distribution that included both @xmath23 and background events . finally , the @xmath26 spectrum , after full acceptance corrections and background subtraction , is shown in figure  [ fig : minv ] .",
    "the curves are fits to the data as described below .",
    "the absolute normalization of the @xmath23 cross section was determined by measuring the yield relative to that of a _ simultaneously _ measured channel with known cross section . for this work",
    "the reference channel was the reaction @xmath39 for which a large amount of data exist  @xcite .",
    "this method to determine the absolute normalization was chosen because it greatly reduced the large systematic uncertainty associated with the absolute calibrations of both beam intensity and absolute trigger efficiency . in order to provide the absolute cross section calibration",
    "the existing published data was first interpolated to get the @xmath40 production cross - section at the beam momentum of the present measurement , and then the appropriate acceptance corrections were applied to determine the @xmath41 total cross section ratio from our yields .",
    "the cross section of the reaction @xmath39 has been interpolated to our beam momentum with several parameterizations that vary smoothly with beam momentum . from these interpolations",
    "we estimate the exclusive @xmath42 production cross section to be @xmath43 at @xmath19 .",
    "the parameterizations describe the existing @xmath40 production data well with the exception of the single measurement at @xmath44 by e.  pickup et al .",
    "@xcite which is significantly underestimated .",
    "this discrepancy has been neglected since that measurement is subject to a large systematic error associated with a quite substantial background subtraction .    in the present data ,",
    "the @xmath40 meson has been identified in the @xmath24 distribution for @xmath45 events , after requiring that the four particle missing mass be consistent with @xmath46 as shown in ref .",
    "the acceptance correction of the @xmath47 channel was performed similarly to the @xmath0 discussed above .",
    "the acceptance correction matrix for the @xmath48 channel has four dimensions .",
    "these are sufficient to completely describe this 5 body final state because the full set of 15 kinematic degrees of freedom ( dof ) is reduced by four - momentum conservation ( -4 dof ) , the azimuthal symmetry of the event ( -1 dof ) , the requirement that @xmath49 ( -1 dof ) , the isotropic orientation of the @xmath40 meson decay plane ( -3 dof ) , and the known matrix element ( -2 dof ) for the @xmath50 decay  @xcite .",
    "after applying the full acceptance corrections to the @xmath51 and @xmath47 channels , the @xmath41 total cross section ratio is determined to be @xmath52 .",
    "the systematic error quoted here arises from the quadratic sum of the uncertainties on the @xmath40 and @xmath25 background subtractions ( 15% and 5% respectively ) , relative acceptance correction ( 11% ) , trigger bias ( 10% ) , tracking efficiency ( 10% ) , and the erenkov particle identification efficiency ( 14% ) .",
    "this value has also been corrected for systematic bias effects due to the different scintillating fiber efficiencies for pions and kaons ( -7.5% ) and from the subtraction of events arising from the target envelope ( + 5% ) .",
    "based on the @xmath40 cross section estimated above in sec .",
    "[ absnorm ] , a total cross section for the reaction @xmath0 of @xmath53 has been determined , where the second error quoted here is the quadratic sum of the systematic uncertainty in the measured yield ratio and the absolute normalization uncertainty for the @xmath40 production cross section .",
    "the present total @xmath0 cross section value is plotted as the solid data point in figure  [ fig : xc ] , where it is compared with estimates of @xmath6 inclusive production cross sections at higher energy ( open circles ) taken from the literature  @xcite .",
    "these additional data points have been deduced from other reactions either by assuming @xmath54 , or by taking the sum of exclusive channels with one or two pions in the final state . the solid curve , corresponding to a prediction from sibirtsev et al .",
    "@xcite using a one meson exchange model including @xmath55 and @xmath56 mesons , accounts well for the @xmath6 cross section measured in this experiment near the production threshold . in comparison , the total cross sections for inclusive @xmath5 production shown as the open diamonds  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : xc ] , are more than an order of magnitude larger at comparable distances above the @xmath5 threshold .      near threshold",
    "the @xmath6 meson is produced , to a large degree , by the decay of the @xmath57 meson as an intermediate state  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the cross section from the resonant production can be determined from the @xmath26 distribution . the @xmath26 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : minv ] has been fit with the sum of a non - resonant contribution and a peak from the @xmath57 resonance .",
    "the shape of the non - resonant contribution was assumed to be given by the @xmath26 distribution for an ensemble of events that are uniformly distributed according to four body ( @xmath23 ) phase space .",
    "the shape of the @xmath57 resonance was given by the natural line - shape folded with a gauss function to account for the detector resolution .",
    "when treating the width ( @xmath58 ) of the gaussian as a free parameter , we find an optimal fit with @xmath59 , in good agreement with simulations of the detector performance .",
    "the total @xmath25 cross section value , as well as the resonant and non - resonant components , are summarized in table  [ tab : crosssec ] .",
    "after correction for the corresponding partial width  @xcite , the total @xmath57 meson production cross section is @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "the systematic errors quoted have the same meaning as explained above .",
    ".total exclusive production cross section for the reaction @xmath0 at 3.67 gev / c and for the resonant ( @xmath57 meson ) and non - resonant contributions .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : crosssec ]",
    "in conclusion , the total cross section of the reaction @xmath0 has been determined for @xmath19 .",
    "this is the first cross section measurement of the @xmath0 channel near threshold , and is equivalent to the inclusive cross section at this beam momentum .",
    "the cross section determined here is more than a factor 20 lower than the measured  @xcite and calculated  @xcite @xmath62 cross section at the same cm energy above threshold .",
    "this large difference in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson production cross sections in proton - proton collisions is in strong contrast to the nearly equal cross sections measured in sub - threshold heavy ion collisions at the same distance from the respective thresholds .",
    "since this discrepancy between heavy ion collisions and proton - proton reactions has been interpreted as possible evidence for in  medium modifications of the @xmath6nucleon interaction , it would be very useful to study the evolution of the relative @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson yields at equal energies from the threshold versus increasing mass number of the colliding nuclei .",
