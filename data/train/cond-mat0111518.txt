    "binary mixtures of polymers and colloidal particles in various solvents are the focus of sustained experimental and theoretical efforts , both because they constitute a challenging problem in statistical mechanics of `` soft matter '' , and because of their technological importance in many industrial processes .",
    "one of the most striking aspects of polymer - colloid mixtures , namely the depletion interaction between colloids induced by non - adsorbing polymer was recognized nearly 50 years ago@xcite .",
    "more recently , the importance of the polymer depletant in determining the phase behavior of the mixtures was realized@xcite , and much recent experimental work was devoted to the phase diagram@xcite , structure@xcite , interfaces@xcite , and to the direct measurement of the effective interactions@xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "most efforts have concentrated on impenetrable spherical colloids , while various models and theoretical techniques have been investigated for the description of the non - adsorbing polymer coils .",
    "the models include non - interacting ( ideal ) polymers@xcite , polymers represented as penetrable - spheres@xcite , and interacting polymers coarse - grained to the level of `` soft colloids''@xcite .",
    "monomer level representations of polymer chains , like the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) model , appropriate in good solvent , have been considered within polymer scaling approaches@xcite , renormalization group ( rg ) theory@xcite , and fluid integral equations@xcite .",
    "while many effects for the simplest case of colloids mixed with non - interacting polymer are quantitatively understood , the behavior of the experimentally more relevant case of polymers with excluded volume interactions is at best understood on a qualitative basis ; a quantitatively reliable theory is still lacking . clearly , to construct such a theory for finite concentrations of colloidal particles",
    ", one must first understand how interacting polymer coils distribute themselves around a single spherical colloid of radius @xmath0 .",
    "this problem is addressed in the present paper using a combination of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and scaling theories to determine the key quantities , which are the monomer or center - of - mass ( cm ) density profiles @xmath1 of saw polymers around a single impenetrable sphere , as well as the resulting surface tension .",
    "if @xmath2 denotes the radius of gyration of the polymers , these quantities clearly depend on the ratio @xmath3 , which controls the curvature effects .",
    "the limit @xmath4 , corresponding to a polymer solution near a planar wall , will be examined first , before considering the case of finite @xmath5 .",
    "the complete theory for the opposite limit , @xmath6 , will be the subject of a future publication , although we show some preliminary results here . throughout this work we focus on the dilute and semi - dilute regimes@xcite of the polymers , where the monomer density @xmath7 is low enough , for detailed monomer - monomer correlations to be unimportant ; the melt regime , where @xmath7 becomes appreciable ,",
    "will not be treated here .",
    "the surface tension of a polymer solution surrounding a sphere is macroscopically defined by considering the immersion of a single hard colloidal particle into a bath of non - adsorbing polymer . because this immersion reduces the number of configurations available to the polymers , resulting in an entropically induced depletion layer around the colloid ,",
    "there is a free energy cost @xmath8 for adding a single sphere to the polymer solution which naturally splits into volume and surface terms : @xmath9 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) , describes the reversible work needed to create a cavity of radius @xmath0 in the polymer solution .",
    "since the osmotic pressure @xmath10 of a polymer solution in the dilute and semi - dilute regimes is quantitatively known as a function of polymer concentration @xmath11 from rg calculations@xcite , this volume term is well understood .",
    "the problem of a quantitative description of a single colloid in a polymer solution thus reduces to understanding the second term , which defines the surface tension @xmath12 , i.e.  the free - energy per unit area that is directly related to the creation of the depletion layer .",
    "it is customary to relate the surface tension @xmath12 around a sphere to the surface tension @xmath13 near a planar wall , by expanding in powers of the ratio @xmath3 : @xmath14 which is expected to be most useful when @xmath5 is not too large .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 control the curvature corrections .",
    "they are analogous to the tolman corrections in the macroscopic case@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the case of a single plate or hard wall immersed in a polymer solution is discussed in section ii , where we report results for density profiles @xmath16 at various polymer concentrations .",
    "these density profiles define the reduced adsorption @xmath17 , from which the surface tension @xmath13 may ultimately be extracted .",
    "these considerations are extended to spherical colloids in section iii , where simulation results for the density profiles are reported for size ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these data are then used to compute @xmath12 and the @xmath20 ; limiting forms are extracted for the @xmath21 and the semi - dilute regimes .",
    "the results are compared to the theoretical predictions for ideal polymers , for the penetrable sphere model , and wherever applicable , to rg and integral equation predictions .",
    "the limit of large @xmath5 , where the expansion ( [ eq1.2 ] ) becomes less useful is also discussed . for this limit",
    "we also report on some preliminary direct simulation results for @xmath8 based on the widom insertion technique@xcite .",
    "finally we show that the `` soft colloid '' paradigm has the correct thermodynamics of the single colloid problem automatically built in .",
    "a single hard wall in a bath of non - adsorbing polymers creates an entropically induced depletion layer because the polymers have fewer possible configurations near the wall . to calculate these density profiles we performed monte - carlo simulations of the popular self avoiding walk ( saw ) model on a cubic lattice .",
    "even though this model ignores all chemical details of a real polymer system except the excluded volume and polymer connectivity , it reproduces the scaling behavior and many other physical properties of athermal polymer solutions  @xcite . for @xmath22 polymers of length @xmath23 on a lattice of @xmath24 sites ,",
    "the polymer density is given by @xmath25 , while the monomer density is @xmath26 .",
    "the polymers are characterized by the radius of gyration , which scales as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the flory exponent@xcite . for densities",
    "@xmath11 less than the overlap density @xmath29 the system is in the dilute regime , while for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , the system is in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "we use @xmath32 saw polymers in our simulations , which are expected to exhibit properties close to those corresponding to the scaling limit @xmath33 .",
    "further details of the simulation method and the model can be found in@xcite .",
    "note that a small correction to these results must be applied@xcite ! since our models are all athermal , we set @xmath34",
    ".    examples of the depletion layer density profiles near a hard wall are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] for a polymer center of mass ( cm ) representation , as well as for a monomer representation .",
    "both profiles have , by definition , the same reduced adsorption , defined as@xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the surface excess grand potential per unit area @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 , with @xmath16 the cm density profile of the polymer coils a distance @xmath39 from the surface . in the monomer representation one should replace @xmath11 by @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the monomer profile",
    "; the two reduced adsorptions are equal and measure the reduction in the number of chains near the surface .    in the low - density limit",
    "an rg calculation based on a first order @xmath42-expansion gives @xmath43@xcite , which is slightly less than @xmath44 the density independent result for an ideal polymer with the same size @xmath2@xcite ( but larger @xmath23 due to the different scaling of the radius of gyration ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that for a given @xmath2 , the polymer - polymer interactions reduce the size of the depletion layer , an effect which becomes more pronounced with increasing density , see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] .    for the semi - dilute regime , de gennes has proposed an approximate expression for the monomer profile near a wall , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the correlation length or blob size@xcite .",
    "if we identify @xmath46 with @xmath47 then , as shown in fig  [ fig : hz ] , this form provides a fairly accurate fit to our simulation results . since @xmath48 in the semi - dilute regime",
    ", this implies that the density profiles should become more narrow with increasing density , a trend clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] .    from the density profiles of fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] , we can derive the adsorption at different densities using eq .",

    "however , as the polymer concentration increases , the measured @xmath53 will decrease with density as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - wall - fit ] . in the semi - dilute regime",
    "this scales as @xmath54@xcite , which decreases much more slowly with density than the correlation length @xmath46 or the relative adsorption @xmath17 .",
    "in fact at @xmath55 , the crossover from the dilute to the semi - dilute regimes , @xmath17 has dropped to @xmath56 of its @xmath57 value , while @xmath53 has only changed by a few @xmath58 .",
    "the largest rate of relative change in the adsorption is therefore found in the dilute regime , suggesting that theories based on the @xmath59 limit may start to break down well before the semi - dilute regime is reached .",
    "the border between the dilute and semi - dilute regimes is not sharp . for the semi - dilute regime ,",
    "the asymptotic forms derived by scaling theories appear to be reached at a lower density for @xmath17 than for @xmath53@xcite .",
    "one route to calculate the surface tensions from the density profiles is to use an extension of the gibbs adsorption equation to express the surface tension near a single wall in terms of the relative adsorption and the equation of state : @xmath60 the derivation of this equation can be found , for example , in@xcite . by performing one integration by parts w.r.t .",
    "density , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) can also be expressed as : @xmath61 the first term in this equation takes the form of a pressure times a length . for ideal polymers , where @xmath17 is independent of density@xcite , this term completely describes the surface tension of the depletion layer .",
    "it is just the ( entropic ) free energy cost per unit area of creating a cavity of volume @xmath62 .",
    "the second ( positive ) term is therefore only relevant if there are polymer - polymer interactions .",
    "we have previously calculated the equation of state for @xmath32 and @xmath63 saw polymers@xcite , both of which are well described by analytic rg expressions@xcite . using this for @xmath10 together with the fit to the relative adsorption from eq .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) , we can now use eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) to calculate the surface tension of a solution of polymers in good solvent near a single wall .",
    "our results are shown in fig  [ fig : gamma - wall ] . in the low density limit",
    "the surface tension reduces to the same functional form as for ideal polymers , i.e.  @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 .",
    "note that for all but the lowest densities , the surface tension is considerably larger than the ideal polymer result @xmath66 .",
    "the surface tension for interacting polymers increases more rapidly with increasing density both because @xmath10 increases faster than @xmath17 decreases in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) , and because the second term , which is absent for non - interacting polymers , increases with density as well .",
    "further simplifications occur in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "for example , when the scaling forms for the osmotic pressure , @xmath67 , and for the reduced adsorption , @xmath68 , are used in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) , then the integral in the second term can be easily performed and turns out to be exactly half the first term , a result that is independent of the value of the exponent @xmath69 .",
    "the surface tension therefore takes on a very simple form : @xmath70 as shown in fig  [ fig : gamma - wall ] , this expression works remarkably well for larger densities into the semi - dilute regime .",
    "deviations do occur for the dilute regime where eq .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) overestimates the surface tension by a factor @xmath71 for @xmath57 , as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",

    "a similar asymptotic rg @xmath42-expansion compares slightly less well .",
    "the difference between the two approximations gives an estimate of the error in the rg approach .",
    "it should be kept in mind that our simulation approach also incurs small errors through the use of the fitted form of @xmath17 , and because we use polymers of a finite length .",
    "fuchs and schweitzer@xcite recently applied the polymer reference interaction site model ( prism ) approach to polymer - colloid mixtures . in the limit of low colloid density",
    ", a number of analytic results can be derived for the insertion free energy @xmath8 , from which the surface tension can be extracted by using eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq1.2 ] ) : @xmath72 here we have used the prism results arising from local packing information ( see @xcite for details ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - wall ] prism shows the correct qualitative but not the correct quantitative behavior .",
    "this is not surprising since these results are based on a simplified prism model which has the advantage of being analytically solvable , but the disadvantage of exhibiting the wrong scaling behavior",
    ". it would be interesting to see how well prism compares for the numerically more complex case where correct scaling behavior is included from the outset .",
    "having described the surface tension for a polymer solution near a single hard wall , we next investigate the related problem of a polymer solution near a single hard sphere ( hs ) of radius @xmath0 . as discussed in the introduction , adding a single hs to a polymer solution reduces the number of configurations available to the polymers , and results in a finite insertion free energy or chemical potential described by eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) . besides the configurations directly excluded by the sphere of volume @xmath73 , there are also configurations excluded near the surface of the sphere , an effect which manifests itself in an entropically driven depletion layer , just as was found for the case of a hard wall .",
    "however , the curvature of the sphere leads to corrections to the planar surface tension , as described by eq .",

    "note that this expression is not simply an expansion in @xmath3 ; it is valid for all size ratios .    in 1958",
    "asakura and ooswawa@xcite introduced a model where the ideal polymers are approximated as inter - penetrable spheres of radius @xmath80 .",
    "this corresponds to approximating the true depletion layer by a step - function .",

    "the surface tension is therefore given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "in this case the curvature corrections have a very simple geometrical origin : the volume of a spherical shell of width @xmath80 with an inner radius of @xmath0 has a larger volume than that of a flat layer of width @xmath80 and area @xmath87 . in part",
    "this is a matter of definition . for hard particles one can also find instances in the literature where @xmath88 is taken as the radius of the gibbs dividing surface .",
    "the ao model surface tension vanishes if it is defined in this way .",
    "if the prescription @xmath89 is used to set the free parameter in the ao model , then the surface tensions for the planar wall is the same as that of ideal polymers .",
    "however , this prescription no longer holds for spheres immersed in a polymer solution since the curvature corrections to the surface tension for ideal polymers are not the same as those of the ao model .",
    "physically this difference arises because the ao model assumes a fixed depletion layer width @xmath80 while the ( ideal ) polymers can deform around a sphere , which leads to an effectively smaller depletion layer .",

    "this is in part because the simplified prism model we compare to also includes ideal polymer statistics , resulting in an overestimate of the monomer density compared to a true interacting system , an effect already pointed out in ref.@xcite .    for large spheres , on the other hand , where @xmath158 which scales as @xmath159 in the semi - dilute regime , the spheres do directly probe the number density of polymer coils , and the insertion free energy for interacting polymers is always higher than that of ideal polymers at the same @xmath2 and @xmath11 .",
    "note how differently the large and small @xmath143 limits of @xmath8 scale both with @xmath11 and with @xmath0 .",
    "significant differences can be also found for the scaling of the surface tensions since for large @xmath143 , @xmath160 , while for small @xmath143 , the rg expressions imply that @xmath161 .",
    "we have recently modeled polymers as single `` soft colloids '' interacting with a pair potential between their cm@xcite .",
    "these pair potentials were derived by a liquid state theory based inversion procedure such that the soft colloids have exactly the same radial distribution function @xmath162 as those generated by a fully interacting polymer simulation .",
    "a similar inversion procedure was used to derive the potential between the soft - colloids and a planar wall or a hs .",
    "these wall - polymer or sphere - polymer potentials are such that they exactly reproduce the one - body density profiles @xmath1 .    since our effective polymer - polymer potentials provide a very accurate representation of the pressure @xmath10@xcite , while the polymer - wall or polymer - sphere interactions are constrained to reproduce the correct density profiles , and therefore the correct adsorption @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) implies that our soft - colloid approach has the correct surface tensions automatically built in . similarly eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) implies that this approach correctly reproduces @xmath138 for a sphere immersed in a polymer solution .",
    "in summary then , we have used computer simulations of saw polymers on a cubic lattice to calculate the density profiles for non - adsorbing polymers near a planar wall , and near hs s . from this",
    "we were able to calculate and fit the relative adsorption @xmath17 .",
    "together with the equation of state , which is well understood for polymer solutions , this provides the needed ingredients to calculate the surface tensions through eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) .",
    "the surface tension of interacting polymers near a planar wall was shown to differ significantly from that of ideal polymers , or other simple models such as the asakura oosawa penetrable - sphere model , or a pure hs fluid .",
    "similarly , a recent prism calculation@xcite also shows large qualitative differences with our results , which could have been anticipated in view of its use of simplified ideal polymer statistics . on the other hand , some recent rg",
    "results@xcite compare very well to our calculations . in the semi - dilute regime",
    ", the surface tension simplifies to the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) , which implies that @xmath163 .",
    "near a sphere with a radius of the same order or larger than @xmath2 , the surface tension @xmath12 of the polymer solution can be written in an expansion in the size - ratio @xmath5 . for decreasing sphere size ( increasing @xmath5 )",
    ", the ratio @xmath113 increases . for a given @xmath5 , however , @xmath12 approaches @xmath13 as the density increases .",
    "we attribute this to the decrease of the effective curvature corrections with increasing density since the blob size scales as @xmath164 in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "this is again consistent with some recent rg calculations of the correction coefficient @xmath123@xcite , although further simulations are needed to confirm the scaling and form of the coefficients @xmath20 .    for smaller colloids , it is advantageous to use a direct widom insertion technique to calculate the free - energy @xmath138 .",
    "for very small colloids ( large @xmath5 ) , our simulations were consistent with asymptotic rg results which suggest that @xmath165 .",
    "this insertion free - energy is dominated by the contribution of the depletion layer ; its behavior is qualitatively different from the behavior found at smaller @xmath5 , and suggests that the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) breaks down for large @xmath5 .",
    "because our soft - colloid approach was derived to reproduce the correct one - particle density profiles near hard walls or hard - spheres , it will automatically reproduce the correct adsorptions , and therefore also the correct surface tensions and insertion free - energies @xmath138 .",
    "the walls and spheres in this study are purely repulsive . adding a wall - polymer attraction should decrease the amount of depletion , and therefore also lower the surface tensions .",
    "more subtle effects could be expected if in addition the solvent quality is decreased .",
    "new effects are also expected for binary mixtures of polymers with selective adsorption of one of the species .",
    "these systems will be the subject of future investigations .",
    "the next step is to move from the one - sphere or one - wall problem to the case of a two - sphere or a two - wall system , and calculate the effective interactions between the two particles .",
