    "we are interested in the cahn - hilliard equation in its simplest , one - dimensional form , @xmath0 posed on the real line @xmath1 .",
    "the equation was originally introduced as a model for phase - separation in binary alloys , and has since been used to describe the formation and annihilation of patterns in many contexts , including phase transitions in material science @xcite , polymer- and protein dynamics @xcite , and pattern formation in fluids @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , this equation reproduces qualitatively and sometimes even quantitatively the spontaneous formation of patterns from homogeneous equilibrium and a subsequent evolution of characteristic wavelengths through a coarsening process . in",
    "bounded , one - dimensional domains , equipped with neumann boundary conditions @xmath2 at @xmath3 or with periodic boundary conditions , the dynamics of the cahn - hilliard equation are fairly well understood . as @xmath4 , solutions converge to the global attractor , which consists of equilibria and heteroclinic orbits between them .",
    "equilibria and their stability properties can be characterized completely , and , to some extent , existence of heteroclinic connections is known .",
    "the equation possesses a lyapunov function ( or free energy ) , @xmath5 that is , @xmath6 for any solution @xmath7 , when @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the equation preserves mass , @xmath9 that is , @xmath10 for any solution @xmath7 .",
    "spatially homogeneous equilibria are unstable for @xmath11 , the spinodal regime . in this regime ,",
    "stable equilibria are monotone ( for neumann boundary conditions ) and resemble a sharp interface separating @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    "spinodal decomposition is usually understood as initial , almost linear motion on the strong unstable manifold of a homogeneous equilibrium , with selected wavenumber predicted by the linear approximation .",
    "this assumes that initial perturbations of an idealized unstable equilibrium state excite all relevant unstable modes in a uniform fashion .",
    "our work here is concerned with a slightly different situation , where perturbations of the unstable equilibrium are confined to a small region in physical space @xmath1 .",
    "one observes that those perturbations evolve into fronts that invade the unstable homogeneous background and leave behind a patterned state . in other words , spinodal decomposition progresses spatially rather than temporally .",
    "this primary front of spinodal decomposition is then followed by a coarsening process , that progresses spatially via secondary ( and tertiary , etc . )",
    "invasion fronts ; see figure [ f:00 ] , below .",
    "the present paper analyzes these invasion fronts .",
    "in particular , we show that such fronts actually exist .",
    "since the state in the wake of any such front is unstable , existence is not immediately clear .",
    "our results , complemented with some numerical computations and direct simulations , show that in this _ spatial spinodal decomposition _ and _ spatial coarsening _ process , one observes increasingly long transients of equilibrium states .",
    "in other words , spatially localized initial conditions initiate a spatial spinodal decomposition and subsequent coarsening process with well - defined characteristic wavenumbers that are visible for long transients .",
    "a similar picture is also observed in the _ temporal spinodal decomposition and coarsening _ process , which starts with white noise initial data .",
    "however , in this latter situation , the transients are not necessarily close to actual unstable equilibrium states and therefore difficult to describe precisely .",
    "our results show that the invasion process actually can occur in a coherent fashion , thus leaving behind a regular , periodic patterns .",
    "the existence of coherent invasion fronts was raised as a question in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is argued there that the instability in the wake of the front may interfere with the primary invasion front .",
    "we will point to some phenomena associated with this interaction in a more quantitative fashion , here .",
    "some of the present work is motivated by and based on joint work with goh and mesuro @xcite on the role of invasion fronts in liesegang pattern formation .",
    "those works focus on the dynamically richer class of phase - field models , which include the cahn - hilliard equation as a limiting case .",
    "the main results there show that one can expect robust occurrence of pattern - forming fronts , based on a dimension - counting argument .",
    "the key observation is that the instability of the pattern in the wake does not interfere with the existence of a primary invasion front as long as the instability is _ non - resonant_. there were however no attempts to actually prove existence of such fronts in @xcite .",
    "the present paper fills this gap in the somewhat simpler context of the cahn - hilliard equation .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that there appear to be very few examples where the existence of pattern - forming fronts has been proved .",
    "the only examples appear to be based on reduction to ginzburg - landau models .",
    "we mention the seminal work by collet and eckmann @xcite , and extensions thereof , @xcite .",
    "most other results on invasion fronts ( and arguably even the ones mentioned here ) rely on comparison principles in scalar equations .    on a technical level ,",
    "our approach is based on the methods laid out in @xcite , where existence of pattern - annihilating fronts in the allen - cahn equation was shown .",
    "different from perturbative or comparison techniques , we rely almost exclusively on topological tools , paired with a priori estimates and the calculation of morse indices as outlined in @xcite . while the general approach from @xcite is viable , several complications arise .",
    "first , a priori estimates are complicated by the absence of a maximum principle ( which was used in the a priori estimates in @xcite ) and , worse , the conserved mass . here",
    ", we rely on energy estimates in uniformly local spaces combined with a priori bounds on mass transport from a lyapunov function .",
    "on the other hand , application of the connection matrix theory is more difficult , here , since bifurcation diagrams can contain subcritical branches , which complicates calculation of relative morse indices and introduces some mild uniqueness of connection graphs .",
    "the remainder of this first section is organized as follows .",
    "we review results on equilibria in the one - dimensional cahn - hilliard equation with periodic boundary conditions in section [ s:1.1 ] .",

    "the most immediate open questions are the stability of these fronts and , more importantly , selection criteria . for instance , one can show that fronts with large speeds @xmath91 exist and are stable ; compare ( * ? ? ? * and  7.5 ) .",
    "starting from initial data where @xmath514 is compactly supported , we expect to see fronts with a distinguished speed , largely independent of the initial disturbance . in the wake of this front",
    ", we expect to see at least a transient pattern with a distinguished wavelength .",
    "both speed and wavelength can be compared to the linear predictions @xmath57 and @xmath68 of the spinodal decomposition front .",
    "we simulated the cahn - hilliard equation using a semi - implicit in time first - order discretization with @xmath515 on a domain of size @xmath516 using a pseudospectral method for space discretization with @xmath517 fourier modes .",
    "initial conditions were a small perturbation of the trivial state @xmath518 . for all simulations , boundaries had only negligible influence , but round - off errors were significant .",
    "we artificially stabilized the unstable trivial state ahead of the leading edge of the front , forcing @xmath519 ahead ( black region in space - time plots ) and @xmath520 only in a wedge ( gray region in space - time plots ) ahead of the front . while this allows one to observe spinodal decomposition fronts quite accurately , we could not find a similar stabilization procedure for the periodic patterns created in the wake of the primary front .",
    "round - off errors therefore make the observation of coarsening fronts and associated wavenumbers and speeds difficult .",
    "figure [ f : expthspin ] shows a comparison of the predicted speed with data from direct numerical simulations .",
    "the comparison shows that the linear prediction is very accurate , even for large mass @xmath521 .",
    "the right - hand plot in figure [ f : expthspin ] shows a comparison of predicted and measured wavenumber in the wake . for masses",
    "@xmath522 , the observed wavenumber in the wake of the front agrees well with the linear prediction . for larger masses , we find smaller wavenumbers  an _ instantaneous coarsening_. the change in wavenumber can be thought of as a hopf bifurcation of the critical invasion front .",
    "in fact , the plotted data suggests typical frequency locking phenomena .",
    "we briefly discussed in section [ s:6.2 ] the existence of such subharmonic invasion fronts .    .",

    "the ratio between measured and predicted wavenumber is plotted.,title=\"fig : \" ]    similarly , one can compare predicted speeds and selected wavenumbers in the wake of coarsening fronts .",
    "based on the dispersion relation at the periodic state in the wake of a spinodal decomposition front , we computed and plotted linearly selected speeds and wavenumbers in figure [ f : coars ] .",
    "we compare those predictions in figure [ f : cet ] with results from direct numerical simulations .",
    "speeds agree within accuracy in the relevant parameter regime , that is , as long as primary and secondary front speeds can be distinguished .",
    "as expected , direct simulations underestimate speeds .",
    "speeds were measured over a distance of approximately 500 units .",
    "comparing wavenumbers ( plot on the right of figure [ f : cet ] ) , one notices first that coarsening fronts select the larger @xmath92 ( and @xmath124 ) value out of the two conjugate floquet exponents . in other words , coarsening is weaker for small masses : rather than having pairs of neighboring spikes merge , some individual spikes survive .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "one also notices that the selected frequency locks to period - doubling quite a bit past the predicted value .",
    "this locking would be predicted near strong resonances and corroborates the analogy between coarsening fronts and hopf bifurcation from periodic orbits .",
    "agreement is somewhat sketchy since round - off errors limit the number of wavelengths in the wake of coarsening fronts to about 10 for masses close to zero .",
    "the theory here can not predict the change in wavenumber in the wake of the spinodal front . on the other hand ,",
    "linear predictions for the speed of coarsening fronts suggest that for masses @xmath523 , coarsening fronts catch up with spinodal decomposition fronts , so that the pattern in the wake coarsens _ instantaneously _ , that is , with the same speed that it is created with ; see figure [ f : coars ] for a comparison of linear coarsening speeds and spinodal decomposition speeds and figure [ f : res ] for a detailed comparison near @xmath524 .",
    "however , a comparison between direct numerical simulations and the linear predictions for the crossover shows a small but significant discrepancy ; see figure [ f : cross ] for an illustration of the crossover between @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "more detailed simulations suggest a crossover between @xmath527 and @xmath528 .",
    "such phenomena , where a secondary front in the wake of a primary front is effectually accelerated have been observed in other scenarios @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is analyzed completely in a simple model problem of coupled kpp equations in @xcite .",
    "the results there indicate robust locking between the two fronts in a regime where the invasion speed of the secondary front is smaller than the speed of the primary front due to the presence of an unstable resonance pole in the linearization of the primary front .",
    "such a mechanism may well be responsible for the observed discrepancy between locking in direct simulations and locking due to faster linear secondary invasion speeds .",
    "( left ) and @xmath526 ( right ) . for @xmath525",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    beyond the first coarsening front , we expect further invasion fronts that subsequently increase the wavelength of the pattern .",
    "we suspect that for large masses , this sequence of coarsening fronts is eventually dominated by period - doubling fronts .",
    "it would be interesting to derive lower ( linear ) bounds on the speeds of these fronts for small wavenumbers and predict wavenumber ratios .",
    "this would in particular give lower bounds on coarsening rates under specific initial disturbances .",
    "both direct simulations and computations of selected wavenumbers based on the dispersion relation using auto07p to solve ( [ e : bvp ] ) suggest that we expect period - doubling for large wavenumbers .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a _ period - doubling cascade _",
    ", where a sequence of invasion fronts leaves behind a sequence of period - doubled pattern . it would be interesting to derive scaling laws for this sequence .",
    "on the other hand , much of the present analysis is very sensitive to noise in the system .",
    "we emphasize that _ all _ states observed are unstable !",
    "noise or round - off errors can and do significantly alter the spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "we point to @xcite and references therein for a general discussion of the role of invasion fronts in noisy systems . the length of the intermediate plateau in the wake of a primary invasion front has been discussed in @xcite in the context of hexagon - roll competition in fluid experiments and in @xcite in the context of hopf bifurcation in population dynamics and the complex ginzburg - landau equation .    in a related direction",
    ", we showed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 3.1 ) that in a general class of random initial conditions one can see a cross - over from temporal to spatial wavenumber selection .",
    "the critical parameter is the probability of localized nucleation events",
    ". it would be interesting to establish theoretical criteria for initial conditions that distinguish between dynamics corresponding to the more commonly known temporal and the more specific spatial mechanisms for spinodal decomposition and coarsening studied here .",
    "we prove propositions [ p:1 ] and [ p:2 ] on existence and stability of equilibria .",
    "the propositions are consequences of the results in @xcite for the case of neumann boundary conditions . in fact , inspecting the steady - state equation , @xmath529 one readily infers that @xmath530 for some @xmath237 . inspecting the phase portrait , one concludes that all periodic solutions are even and therefore occur in the neumann problem as well . in other words , the bifurcation diagrams for neumann boundary conditions",
    "is the same as for periodic boundary conditions on an interval twice the size . in order to prove propositions [ p:1 ] and [ p:2 ]",
    ", we first notice that the morse indices near the bifurcation points are an immediate consequence of the morse index of the trivial solution together with an exchange - of - stability consideration .",
    "it remains to exclude changes in morse index along the branch .",
    "for this , we need to show that the linearization at a periodic , even solution does not possess neutral eigenvalues when restricted to the subspace of odd functions , with the exception of the translational 0-eigenvalue .",
    "since the linearization is self - adjoint with respect to the @xmath245-scalar product , we can further restrict to the kernel of the linearization .",
    "candidates for solutions in the kernel are solutions to a fourth - order , time - periodic differential equation , @xmath531 or , @xmath532 a basis for the four - dimensional space of solutions can be found setting @xmath533 , @xmath534 , or @xmath535 . for @xmath533 ,",
    "we find @xmath536 and @xmath537 , where @xmath538 denotes the derivative with respect to the amplitude @xmath539 .",
    "since the period is a monotone function of the period for the simple cubic , @xmath537 is not periodic . on the other hand , setting @xmath540 and @xmath541 , we find the solution @xmath542 , which is even ( and periodic precisely at the turning points of branches in the transitional regime ) .",
    "the last case , @xmath543 only gives linearly growing solutions .",
    "we conclude that there are no periodic odd eigenfunctions other than the derivative @xmath536 , so that the morse index in the space of periodic functions is as described in propositions [ p:1 ] and [ p:2 ] .",
