    "accretion physics has been extensively studied for decades particularly from theoretical aspects including semi - analytic investigations as well as global numerical simulations in an effort to further understand its physical nature and observational consequences .",
    "many of these works on bh accretion in general have broadly revealed , among others , an important generic feature of accretion ; i.e. the formation of shocks as accreting plasma is subject to outward forces via a number of decelerating mechanisms * ? ? ? * and develop a shock front at @xmath18 within the radius of the inner edge of a magnetized accretion disk , perhaps equivalent to a stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a pure hd keplerian disk , before crossing an event horizon at @xmath19 .",

    "in particular , an extensive theoretical studies of various types of shocks have been conducted to date in an attempt to understand its dynamical behavior ; e.g. shock oscillation in the context of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and its spectroscopic signatures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the expected highly magnetized shocked region may perhaps correspond to the magnetically - arrested plasma seen in the other large - scale simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a generic feature of accretion shocks unambiguously revealed in the earlier theoretical work by many authors , the downstream flow across the shock front is thus compressed and heated up efficiently to generate additional entropy all the way down to the horizon unless a cooling process is sufficiently efficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the detailed formalism and numerical methodology in these works are different , the presence of shocks in accretion is strongly favored in these calculations . as a result , the postshock region at small radii will provide an ideal site where the accelerated electrons could compton up - scatter the thermal photons from an accretion disk .",
    "this process can produce a characteristic excess component in soft x - ray band below @xmath21 kev as a substantially modified disk blackbody radiation , and its spectral shape depends on a number of variables related to mhd accretion processes .",
    "our current work is thus motivated by this long - standing implication of shock formation in accretion .",
    "utilizing the models of t02 and f07 , we thus make a preliminary attempt in this paper to calculate the expected soft x - ray excess spectrum in the context of the well - explored grmhd shocked accretion models in the past work ( t02 , f07 ) . as depicted in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , we assume magnetized equatorial accretion with its inner edge of @xmath22 ( similar to the standard shakura - sunyaev disk @xcite ) in this model as a reservoir for incoming euv photons .",
    "plasma near @xmath23 ( i.e. isco - like boundary radius as discussed in @xcite ) eventually begins to plunge in and subsequently develops an adiabatic standing shock at a very small radius determined primarily by the plasma conditions such as energy , angular momentum and mass - accretion rate , for example .",
    "it is reminded , in the case of grmhd accretion , that there exist a multiple magnetosonic points between @xmath22 and @xmath24 ( see t02 and t06 for more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the downstream region is therefore heated by adiabatic shock compression creating a centrally - concentrated , compact hot region similar to the putative x - ray coronae ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the incoming blueshifted disk photons towards the downstream plasma is then comptonized by hot electrons in the postshock flow producing the soft excess .",

    "* for a fundamental difference from the standard bulk motion comptonization model ) .",
    "our study focuses on explicitly constraining the defining parameters of the grmhd accretion models by clearly identifying the physical origin of the observed soft excess feature as a shock - heating innermost downstream flow .",

    "it is found that comptonization due to standing shock is very sensitive to the shock property controlled primarily by the downstream energy @xmath2 while not so significantly dependent on bh spin @xmath32 in that the calculated spectra are almost generically self - similar regardless of the exact value of bh spin .",
    "this may thus be indicative of model degeneracy with bh spin . in the present calculations we treat arbitrarily the normalization of comptonized spectrum as a free parameter .",
    "that is , the flux level of the calculated excess component is not determined by the model but is only provided by data .",
    "technically speaking , the intensity of the excess component must be coupled with plasma property ( such as density , temperature and magnetic field strength ) and should be self - consistently calculated by the model .",
    "it is important , however , to examine how much energy is physically available in the postshock region in comparison with the observed soft excess flux . to clearly address the modeled excess intensity ,",
    "a more rigorous consideration of the compsh normalization is necessary as a future work .",
    "while still open to debate how much comptonized flux can be produced from the small downstream region , one might argue that relativistic beaming ( via light bending effect ) of seed photons towards small radii could preferentially allow for a sufficient centrally - concentrated illumination ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this may yield enough comptonized photons possibly in a scenario analogous to the observed double - peaked h@xmath69 emission line from agn accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work",
    ", we assumed a split - monopole field configuration .",
    "although not globally applicable , this is an approximate solution to the trans - field equation ( i.e. gr gs - equation ) as originally discussed in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , state - of - the - art numerical simulations in recent years from different groups indicate a characteristic field topology very similar to that described as the split - monopole @xcite .",
    "although a detailed structure and strength of the actual magnetic field at the horizon scale still remains unclear , this approximation is a first step forward to the problem . nonetheless , the accreting plasma models listed in table  1 yield the field strength on the order of @xmath328 g consistent with the known estimates to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while treated as fully relativistic under strong gravity , we note that the current model is time - independent based on axisymmetric plasma .",
    "this assumption makes it impossible for us to predict any temporal nature of the soft excess considered in this work ; e.g. spectral time variabilities associated with shock compression and cooling effects .",
    "the downstream plasma properties are numerically solved by considering adiabatic ( nonradiative ) rankine - hugoniot jump conditions as a pure mathematical discontinuity with no energy / mass loss .",
    "hence , most of the heat generated at the shock front is advected with the downstream plasma . a more realistic shock process , on the other hand , is most likely accompanied by radiative cooling to some degree in which the postshock plasma temperature may stay comparatively as cool as that of the upstream one as in the isothermal shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiative dissipation at the shock front could therefore drastically change the subsequent downstream plasma condition which in turn alters the comptonization process . in reality , furthermore , accreting plasma may be characterized by a two - temperature gas between electrons and ions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) unless the coulomb coupling between the two is very efficient , whereas in this work we prescribed a single - fluid approximation for simplicity .",
    "@xcite have considered a particle transport process ( e.g. bulk advection , spatial diffusion and particle escape ) via the effects of the first - order fermi acceleration across a standing shock . in a more self - consistent scenario",
    "such a calculation of diffusive shock acceleration should be incorporated to reflect the energetic outflows / jets from the shock front .",
    "although all these micro - physics should be addressed and incorporated into more sophisticated calculations by grmhd simulations for completeness , this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the other potentially important spectral components associated with magnetic fields include synchrotron radiation , and its comptonization have also been extensively considered in the literature in the context of black hole binaries such as cygnus x-1 , for example , via nonthermal powerlaw electrons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this is especially important in black hole binaries , the characteristic synchrotron frequency in agns is estimated to be @xmath329 } ~ \\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] [ ev ] where @xmath330 is the field strength in units of @xmath331 g and we take @xmath332 in this model .",
    "hence , those comptonized photons are less likely to be significant to the composite spectrum from the innermost accretion region of agns that are considered in this work .",
    "we have analyzed in this work a seyfert galaxy , ark  120 , to demonstrate that the proposed model successfully describes the observed soft excess feature within the framework of a simplistic accretion model . as there is a number of archival x - ray data available mainly from typical narrow - line seyfert agns and pg quasars that also exhibit strong excess components ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for 20 to 30 agns ) in the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn observations , we will extend the current study to those available for a more systematic analysis . despite a simplistic prescription of the proposed scenario based on grmhd shock formation ,",
    "our comptonization model is successful in describing the observed soft excess feature in ark  120 .",
    "we thus find the current result to be an encouraging first step towards the next level where additional relevant physics are employed to make the model more physically self - consistent and promising .    as a next - generation x - ray observatory ,",
    "we anticipate advanced new x - ray missions , such as _ athena _ , to contribute significantly to this study particularly with the high - resolution x - ray microcalorimeter spectrometer by providing more detailed spectra simultaneously on the soft and hard x - ray components .",
    "the expected data will thus help differentiate various ( fundamentally ) distinct models presented today and further clarify the current ambiguous views concerning the observed soft excess in the immediate circumnuclear region of agns .",
