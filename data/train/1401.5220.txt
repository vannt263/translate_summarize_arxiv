    "in a recent paper published in science @xcite , carla staver , sally archibald and simon levin argued that tree cover does not increase continuously with rainfall but rather is constrained to low ( @xmath250% , `` savanna '' ) or high ( @xmath375% , `` forest '' ) levels . in follow - up work published in ecology @xcite , the american naturalist @xcite and journal of mathematical biology @xcite , they studied the following ode for the evolution of the fraction of land covered by grass @xmath4 , saplings @xmath5 and trees @xmath6 : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 are the death rates for saplings and trees , and @xmath9 is the rate at which saplings grow into trees . fires decrease this rate of progression , and the incidence of fires is an increasing function of the fraction of grass , so @xmath9 is decreasing .",
    "studies suggest ( see @xcite for references ) that regions with tree cover below about 40% burn frequently but fire is rare above this threshold , so they used an @xmath10 that is close to a step function .",
    "the ode in ( [ mode ] ) has very interesting behavior : it may have two stable fixed points , changing the values of parameters may lead to hopf bifurcations , and if the system has an extra type of savanna trees , there can be periodic orbits . in this paper , we will begin the study of the corresponding spatial model .",
    "the state at time @xmath11 is @xmath12 , where @xmath13grass , @xmath14sapling and @xmath15tree . given the application , it would be natural to restrict our attention to @xmath16 , but since the techniques we develop will be applicable to other systems we consider the general case .    in the forest model ,",
    "it is natural to assume that dispersal of seeds is long range . to simplify our calculations",
    ", we will not use a continuous dispersal distribution for tree seeds , but instead let @xmath17 denote the fraction of sites of type @xmath18 in the box @xmath19^d$ ] and declare that site @xmath20 changes :    * @xmath21 at rate @xmath22 , * @xmath23 at rate @xmath24 , * @xmath25 at rate @xmath26 , * @xmath27 at rate @xmath28 .",
    "the configuration with all sites 0 is an absorbing state .",
    "this naturally raises the question of finding conditions that guarantee that coexistence occurs , i.e. , there is a stationary distribution in which all three types are present .",
    "our model has three states but it is `` attractive , '' that is , if @xmath29 for all @xmath20 then we can construct the two processes on the same space so that this inequality holds for all time . from this , it follows from the usual argument that if we start from @xmath30 then @xmath31 converges to a limit @xmath32 that is a translation invariant stationary distribution , and there will be a nontrivial stationary distribution if and only if @xmath33 . since 2 s",
    "give birth to 1 s and 1 s grow into 2 s , if @xmath32 is nontrivial then both species will be present with positive density in @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath34 is constant , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , then our system reduces to one studied by krone @xcite . in his model , 1 s are juveniles who are not yet able to reproduce .",
    "krone proved the existence of nontrivial stationary distributions in his model by using a simple comparison between the sites in state 2 and a discrete time finite - dependent oriented percolation . in the percolation process",
    ", we have an edge from @xmath37 if a 2 at @xmath20 at time @xmath38 will give birth to a 1 at @xmath39 , which then grows to a 2 before time @xmath40 , and there are no deaths at @xmath20 or @xmath39 in @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "as the reader can imagine , this argument produces a very crude result about the parameter values for which coexistence occurs .",
    "a simple comparison shows that if we replace the decreasing function @xmath9 in the staver  levin model , @xmath42 , by the constant @xmath43 , to obtain a special case @xmath44 of krone s model , then @xmath42 dominates @xmath44 in the sense that given @xmath45 the two processes can be coupled so that @xmath46 for all @xmath11 . because of this , we can prove existence of nontrivial stationary distribution in the staver ",

    "we note that :    for the mean - field ode ( [ kmode ] ) , @xmath50 is not an attracting fixed point if @xmath51 on the other hand , @xmath50 is attracting if @xmath52    when @xmath53 , and hence @xmath54 , the mean - field ode is approximately @xmath55 the trace of @xmath56 , which is the sum of its eigenvalues is negative , so @xmath1 is not attracting if the determinant of @xmath56 , which is the product of the eigenvalues is negative . since @xmath57",

    "foxall @xcite has shown that for krone s model the existence of nontrivial stationary distribution is equivalent to survival for a finite set of nonzero sites , so we only have to prove one of these conclusions . however , our proof is via a block construction , so we get both conclusions at the same time .",

    "we will now describe the main ideas and then explain where the details can be found .",
    "_ the key idea _ is due to grannan and swindle @xcite .",
    "they consider a model of a catalytic surface in which atoms of type @xmath96 land at vacant sites ( 0 s ) at rate @xmath97 , while adjacent @xmath98 pairs turn into @xmath99 at rate @xmath100 .",
    "if after a landing event , several @xmath98 pairs are created , one is chosen at random to be removed .",
    "the first type of event is the absorption of an atom onto the surface of the catalyst , while the second is a chemical reaction , for example , carbon monoxide @xmath101 and oxygen  @xmath102 reacting to produce @xmath103 .",
    "the last reaction occurs in the catalytic converted in your car , but the appropriate model for that system is more complicated .",
    "an oxygen molecule @xmath104 lands and dissociates to two @xmath102 bound to the surface when a pair of adjacent sites is vacant .",
    "see durrett and swindle @xcite for more details about the phase transition in the system .",
    "suppose without loss of generality that @xmath105 . in this case , grannan and swindle @xcite showed that if @xmath106 the only possible stationary distributions concentrate configurations that are @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "mountford and sudbury @xcite later improved this result by showing that if @xmath109 and the initial configuration has infinitely many 1 s then the system converges to the all 1 s state .",

    ", it follows that such events eventually do not occur .",
    "_ recovery from small density _ is the next step .",

    "_ bounding the location of the positive density box _ is the next step .",
    "to do this , we use a comparison with branching random walk to show that the small box @xmath128 with density @xmath134 constructed in step  ( ii ) is not too far from 0 .",
    "random walk estimates will later be used to control how far it will wander as we iterate the construction . for this step ,",
    "it is important that the truncated process is invariant under reflection , so the mean displacement is 0 . if we try to work directly with the original interacting particle system @xmath44 then it is hard to show that the increments between box locations are independent and have mean 0 .",
