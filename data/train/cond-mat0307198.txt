    "the production and detection of entangled particles is the essence of quantum information processing @xcite . in optics ,",
    "this is well - established with polarization - entangled photon pairs , but in the solid state it remains an experimental challenge .",
    "there exist several theoretical proposals for the production and detection of entangled electrons @xcite .",
    "these theoretical works address mainly pure states .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate what happens if the state is mixed .",
    "some aspects of this problem were also considered in refs .",
    "we go a bit further by comparing violation of the bell inequality to the degree of entanglement of the mixed state .",
    "the bell inequality is a test for the existence of nonclassical correlations in a state shared by two spatially separated observers @xcite .",
    "it is called an entanglement `` witness '' , because violation of the inequality implies that the state is quantum mechanically entangled  but not the other way around @xcite .",
    "more precisely , while all entangled pure states violate the bell inequality , there exist mixed states which are entangled and nevertheless satisfy the inequality @xcite .",
    "a mixed state can arise either because of the interaction with an environment ( proper mixture ) or because the detector does not differentiate among certain degrees of freedom of the entangled pure state ( improper mixture ) .",
    "generically , the loss of purity of a state is associated with a decrease in the degree of entanglement ( although this is not necessarily so ) .",
    "applications of these general notions typically involve polarization - entangled photon pairs @xcite . the transition from pure to mixed states , and the associated degradation of entanglement ,",
    "can be avoided quite effectively in that context  even if the photons interact strongly with matter degrees of freedom . for a dramatic demonstration ,",
    "see a recent experiment @xcite and theory @xcite on plasmon - assisted entanglement transfer .",
    "in essence , this robustness of photon entanglement is a manifestation of the fact that linear optics is an excellent approximation even if the medium in which the photons propagate is strongly scattering and absorbing .    the entanglement scheme that we will analyze here , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , involves the landau level index of an electron and hole quasiparticle .",
    "the scheme differs from earlier proposals in that the entanglement is produced by a single - electron hamiltonian , without requiring coulomb interaction or the superconductor pairing interaction .",
    "we consider one specific mechanism for the loss of purity , namely interaction with the environment .",
    "we model this interaction phenomenologically by introducing phase factors in the scattering matrix and subsequently averaging over these phases . a more microscopic treatment ( for example along the lines of a recent paper @xcite )",
    "is not attempted here .",
    "the mixed state created by this averaging is a proper mixture .",
    "an improper mixture would result from energy averaging .",
    "we assume that the applied voltage is sufficiently small that we can neglect energy averaging .",
    "experimentally , both energy and phase averaging may play a role @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ bell_circuit ]",
    "we illustrate the method to produce and detect entangled edge states in the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the thick black lines indicate the boundaries of a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath3 ensures that the transport near the fermi level @xmath4 takes place in two edge channels , extended along a pair of equipotentials ( thin solid and dashed lines , with arrows that give the direction of propagation ) . a split gate electrode ( shaded rectangles at the center )",
    "divides the conductor into two halves , coupled by tunneling through a narrow opening ( dashed arrow , scattering matrix @xmath5 ) .",
    "if a voltage @xmath6 is applied between the two halves , then there is a narrow energy range @xmath7 above @xmath4 in which the edge channels are predominantly filled in the left half ( solid lines ) and predominantly empty in the right half ( dashed lines ) .",
    "tunneling events introduce filled states in the right half [ black dots , creation operator @xmath8 and empty states in the left half [ open circles , creation operator @xmath9 .",
    "these are quasiparticle excitations of the vacuum state @xmath10 , corresponding to empty states in the left half and filled states in the right half . to leading order in the tunneling probability",
    "the wavefunction is given by @xmath11 the matrix @xmath12 is given in terms of a pauli matrix , @xmath13 and the reflection and transmission matrices @xmath14 .",
    "( these are @xmath15 submatrices of @xmath5 . )",
    "the state @xmath16 is a superposition of the vacuum state @xmath17 and the entangled particle - hole state @xmath18 .",
    "terms containing two particles or two holes are of higher order in the tunneling probability and can be neglected .",
    "we also assume that the applied voltage is sufficiently small that the energy dependence of the scattering matrix need not be taken into account .",
    "dephasing is introduced phenomenologically through random phase shifts @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) accumulated in channel @xmath21 at the left ( right ) of the tunnel barrier .",
    "the reflection and transmission matrices transform as @xmath22 by averaging over the phase shifts , with distribution @xmath23 , the pure state ( [ psidef ] ) is converted into a mixed state . projecting out the vacuum contribution ( which does not contribute to current fluctuations ) , we obtain for this mixed state the @xmath24 density matrix @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the average over the phases .",
    "the degree of entanglement is quantified by the concurrence @xmath1 , given by @xcite @xmath27 the @xmath28 s are the eigenvalues of the matrix product @xmath29 , in the order @xmath30 .",
    "the concurrence ranges from 0 ( no entanglement ) to 1 ( maximal entanglement ) .",
    "the entanglement of the particle - hole excitations is detected by the violation of the bell - chsh ( clauser - horne - shimony - holt ) inequality @xcite .",
    "this requires two gate electrodes to locally mix the edge channels ( scattering matrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and two pairs of contacts @xmath33 to separately measure the current fluctuations @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) in each transmitted and reflected edge channel . in the tunneling regime",
    "the bell inequality can be formulated in terms of the low - frequency noise correlator @xcite @xmath37 at low temperatures ( @xmath38 ) the correlator has the general expression @xcite @xmath39 we again introduce the random phase shifts into @xmath40 and @xmath41 and average the correlator .",
    "the bell - chsh parameter is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is related to the average correlators @xmath44 by @xmath45 the state is entangled if @xmath46 for some set of @xmath15 unitary matrices @xmath47 . if @xmath48 the entanglement is maximal .",
    "we simplify the problem by assuming that the two transmission eigenvalues ( eigenvalues of @xmath49 ) are identical : @xmath50 . in the absence of dephasing the electron and hole",
    "then form a maximally entangled pair .",
    "the transmission matrix @xmath51 and reflection matrix @xmath52 in this case are equal to a scalar times a unitary matrix @xmath53 .",
    "any @xmath15 unitary matrix @xmath54 can be parameterized by @xmath55 in terms of four real parameters @xmath56 .",
    "the angle @xmath57 governs the extent to which @xmath54 mixes the degrees of freedom ( no mixing for @xmath58 , complete mixing for @xmath59 ) .",

    "( [ gammadef ] ) the parametrization @xmath61 in the same parametrization , the matrix @xmath62 which appears in eq .",
    "( [ cijudef ] ) takes the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "we have used the identity @xmath65 to relate the parametrization of @xmath62 to that of @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath66 independent of the phase shifts @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    to average the phase factors we assume that the phase shifts at the left and the right of the tunnel barrier are independent , so @xmath67 .",
    "the complex dephasing parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are defined by @xmath70    the density matrix ( [ rhodef ] ) of the mixed particle - hole state has , in the parametrization ( [ gammaparam ] ) , the elements @xmath71 we have defined @xmath72 , @xmath73 . the concurrence @xmath1 , calculated from eq .",

    "( [ rhoresult ] ) and ( [ eulurparam ] ) , we see that @xmath84 ( the transpose appears because of the transformation from electron to hole operators at the left of the barrier . )",
    "this is an explicit demonstration that the noise correlator ( [ edef ] ) measures the density matrix ( [ rhodef ] ) of the projected electron - hole state  without the vacuum contribution .",
    "the maximal value @xmath0 of the bell - chsh parameter ( [ chshdef ] ) for an arbitrary mixed state was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a pure state with concurrence @xmath1 one has simply @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for a mixed state there is no one - to - one relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "depending on the density matrix , @xmath0 can take on values between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the general formula @xmath87 for the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath88 involves the two largest eigenvalues @xmath89 of the real symmetric @xmath90 matrix @xmath91 constructed from @xmath92 . for our density matrix ( [ rhoresult ] ) we find from eq .",

    "the dephasing parameter @xmath98 decreases from 1 ( upper right corner , no dephasing ) to 0 ( lower left , complete dephasing ) with steps of 0.05 .",

    "the same relation @xmath2 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 holds as for pure states ( dotted curve ) .",
    "violation of the bell inequality is then equivalent to entanglement",
    ". for @xmath99 there exist entangled states ( @xmath100 ) without violation of the bell inequality ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "violation of the bell inequality is then a sufficient but not a necessary condition for entanglement .",
    "we define two characteristic dephasing parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 by the smallest values such that @xmath103 the number @xmath101 is the dephasing parameter below which bell s inequality can not be violated ; the dephasing parameter @xmath102 gives the border between entanglement and no entanglement . from eqs .",
    "( [ cfinal ] ) and ( [ efinal ] ) we obtain @xmath104 the two dephasing parameters are plotted in fig .",
    "the inequality @xmath105 reflects the fact that @xmath0 is an entanglement witness .    , while entanglement is preserved for @xmath106 .",
    "the shaded region indicates dephasing and mixing parameters for which there is entanglement without violation of the bell - chsh inequality . ]    in conclusion , we have shown that the extent to which dephasing prevents the bell inequality from detecting entanglement depends on the mixing of the degrees of freedom at the tunnel barrier .",
    "no mixing ( @xmath77 ) means that the maximally entangled electron - hole pair produced by the tunnel barrier is in one of the two bell states latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{\\alpha}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\!\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle + e^{i\\alpha}|\\!\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle ) , \\quad    ( in our case the landau level index @xmath36 replaces the spin index @xmath108 , @xmath109 . )",
    "then there is finite entanglement and finite violation of the bell inequality for arbitrarily strong dephasing @xcite , and moreover there is the same one - to - one relation between degree of entanglement and violation of the bell inequality as for pure states . all this no longer holds for non - zero mixing ( @xmath99 ) , when the maximally entangled electron - hole pair is in a superposition of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "then the entanglement disappears for a finite dephasing strength and the bell inequality is no longer capable of unambiguously detecting entanglement .",
