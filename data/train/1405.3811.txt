    "scalar - tensor ( st ) theory is an alternative theory that describes gravity beyond einstein s general relativity ( gr ) . this theory was originally conceived by jordan and later generalized by brans and dicke @xcite .",

    "the gravitational coupling is determined by all matter in the universe .",
    "the cosmological distribution of matter will affect local gravitational experiments @xcite .",
    "currently , interests in st theory come from many aspects .",

    "it is expected that the strong gravity test can be a possible way to distinguish the st theory from gr .    for compact stars in st theory ,",
    "unexpected phenomenon has been discovered compared with gr @xcite .",
    "for the black hole ( bh ) background in st theory , when the scalar field settles to a constant , we can get the same bh solution as that in gr @xcite .",
    "however the perturbations will behave differently as the two theories have different dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that compared with the kerr bh background in gr , the existence of a scalar mode in the spectrum of perturbations around a kerr bh in the st theory leads to remarkable effects @xcite .",
    "when the matter configuration surrounding the kerr black hole is dense enough , the bh will be forced to develop scalar hair . on the other hand , when the bh rotates sufficiently fast , superradiant instability can occur .",
    "neither of these instabilities has been observed in the kerr bh solution background in gr .",
    "this gives the hope that bhs can be used as probes in order to distinguish",

    "we will concentrate on looking for unstable modes with @xmath82 , which signal the instability with the growing behavior of the perturbations . to calculate the perturbation frequencies",
    ", we need to impose suitable boundary conditions , @xmath83 this boundary condition is physically acceptable , which corresponds to a purely ingoing wave at the bh event horizon and an outgoing wave at the cosmological horizon . in asymptotically flat spacetime , for example the kerr bh",
    ", there is no cosmological horizon and the outgoing wave condition is put at the infinity .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that when the conditions at infinity in asymptotically flat bh are altered in de sitter black hole , the usual power - law scenario in the late time tail of the perturbation in asymptotically flat bh does not necessarily survive in the de sitter background .",
    "thus it is of interest to examine the superradiant stability in the kerr - de sitter configuration and compare with the result disclosed in the kerr bh @xcite .    in general",
    ", it is difficult to solve the perturbation equations analytically .",
    "so special numerical techniques have been developed to calculate the perturbations of bhs @xcite , such as pschl - teller potential method @xcite , finite difference method @xcite , wkb approximation @xcite , continued fraction method @xcite , direct integration method ( also called shooting method ) @xcite , etc . in this paper",
    ", we will use the direct integration method to calculate the frequencies of the perturbations . the algorithm of this method",
    "can be described briefly as follows : with the boundary conditions ( [ boundarycondition ] ) , we can perform two integrations : ( 1 ) solve the radial equation from the bh event horizon by integration to a matching point @xmath84 ; ( 2 ) solve the radial equation from cosmological horizon to the matching point . then by matching the two integration results",
    ", we can derive the frequencies of the perturbations .",
    "the numerical results are given in the next section .      before doing numerical calculations ,",
    "let us briefly derive the superradiant condition for kerr - de sitter bh .",
    "taking the following variables @xmath85 the radial equation ( [ eq : radial eq ] ) can be written in the form of schrdinger equation @xmath86 in which the effective potential reads @xmath87    in a scattering experiment , solution of ( [ schrodingereq ] ) has the following asymptotic behavior @xmath88 the above boundary conditions correspond to an incident wave of unit amplitude , @xmath89 , plunges in from the cosmological horizon and gives rise to a reflected wave of amplitude @xmath90 going back to the cosmological horizon and a transmitted wave of amplitude @xmath91 at the bh event horizon . considering that the effective potential is real , so @xmath92 ( complex conjugate of @xmath93 ) is also a solution of ( [ schrodingereq ] ) .",
    "the wronskian of the two linearly - independent solutions , @xmath94 , is a constant independent of @xmath95 . equating values of the wronskian at the bh event horizon and at the cosmological horizon , we get @xmath96",
    "then we can see that if @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 .",
    "this means that the amplitude of the reflected wave is larger than that of the incident wave , and superradiance phenomenon occurs .",
    "so we get the condition to trigger the superradiance @xcite @xmath99 when there is no cosmological constant , from ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) , we see that the superradiant condition goes back to that for the kerr bh .",
    "we list our numerical results in this section .",
    "we fix the bh mass parameter @xmath45 , @xmath100 in the matter profile and the angular indexes @xmath101 . there are four free parameters left to affect the numerical results , namely the cosmological constant @xmath102 , the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath103 , the location of the matter shell @xmath104 and the coupling between matter and the scalar field @xmath61 . to see the effect of rotation on the instability , in the following we will consider three cases with @xmath105 , respectively . and in each case , we will choose some values of @xmath102 to see the influence of the cosmological constant on the instability .      in this subsection",
    ", we fix the angular momentum per unit mass of the bh and examine the influences of the other parameters on the superradiant stability .    in figure 2 , we repeat the result of the superradiant instability in the kerr bh background and we find that our numerical results are in good agreement with that reported in @xcite .",
    "this gives us confidence in generalizing our numerical calculation to examine the stability in the kerr - de sitter backgrounds .    from figs.3 - 5",

    "the decrease of the upper bound in the superradiant condition ( 25 ) results in the decrease of the real part of the perturbation frequencies .",
    "this can be seen clearly from fig.3 - 5 .",
    "in addition , we can read from fig.3 - 5 that the imaginary part of the frequencies also decreases with the increase of the cosmological constant in the kerr - de sitter background .",
    "thus the superradiant instability is quenched with the increase of the cosmological constant .",
    "physically this can be understood by looking at the effective potential in fig.6 .",
    "fixing parameters @xmath120 , we see that with the increase of the cosmological constant in the kerr - de sitter bh background , the potential well becomes shallower and the barrier to reflect radiation back becomes lower .",
    "this leads to fewer outgoing waves to be reflected back and stored in the potential well , which explains why the superradiant instability is quenched for large cosmological constant .    comparing figs.3 - 5 ,",
    "we find that to compensate the influence brought by increasing the cosmological constant , we need larger @xmath61 or smaller @xmath104 to trigger the superradiant instability in the kerr - de sitter background . from ( [ eq : effective - mass ] ) , we can see that larger @xmath61 or smaller @xmath104 leads to bigger effective mass and so that higher effective potential barrier .",
    "objective pictures of the effective potentials due to the influences of @xmath61 and @xmath104 are shown in fig.7 .",
    "it is clear that for fixed @xmath104 , the increase of @xmath61 increases the potential barrier height which is able to reflect more radiations back .",
    "fixing @xmath61 , the decrease of @xmath104 has the same effect . besides if we look closely at the potentials in fig.7 near the bh event horizon , the first potential barrier is higher so that the developed potential well is deeper for bigger @xmath61 as well as for smaller @xmath104 .",
    "thus more outgoing wave can be reflected back by the higher potential wall and accumulated in the deeper potential well .",
    "this accounts for the phenomenon that with the increase of the cosmological constant we need to count on bigger @xmath61 and smaller @xmath104 to spark off the superradiant instability .    from figs.3 - 5",
    "we also observe some similar properties to those of the kerr bh reported in @xcite .",
    "when the matter shell is too close to the kerr - de sitter bh with very small @xmath104 , there is no superradiant instability , since the real part of the frequencies scales as @xmath121 and too small @xmath104 will make the frequency violate the superradiant condition . if @xmath104 is not small enough , the superradiant instability can appear , but this instability will be quenched as soon as the superradiant condition is saturated . the value of @xmath104 where the instability starts to appear decreases with the increase of the cosmological constant adopted .",
    "when @xmath104 is big , the positive imaginary part of the frequencies can last for sufficiently large @xmath61 .",
    "this is because that once @xmath61 is big enough to provide high enough potential barrier to bounce back the outgoing wave , further increasing @xmath61 to raise the height of the potential wall will not contribute more to the instability .",

    "we focus on the four - dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter bh at the center sounded by spherical shell of scalar field . adopting the decomposition of the scalar field @xmath155 , the radial wave equation of the scalar field obeys @xmath156\\psi_{lm}(r ) & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath157 here we have taken the tortoise coordinate defined as @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath159 is required to satisfy boundary conditions , namely the outgoing wave at the cosmological horizon and ingoing wave at the bh event horizon .",
    "the frequency @xmath160 is complex , @xmath81 .",
    "the unstable modes correspond to @xmath82 .    according to the well known result in quantum mechanics @xcite , the sufficient condition for this potential to lead to an instability",
    "is @xmath161 combining with ( [ eq : effpoten ] ) , this condition becomes @xmath162 it is obvious that this sufficient condition can be satisfied if the effective mass square is sufficiently negative .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that for higher dimensional and charged de sitter bhs , the instability condition can also be fulfilled if the effective mass square is negative enough .    to understand the instability due to the spontaneous scalarization in the presence of matter , we focus on the final state of spherically symmetric configurations described by @xmath163 the scalar field @xmath164 can be integrated from the klein - gordon equation , obeying @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the scalar charge ( the integral constant ) .",
    "the bh event horizon ( @xmath167 ) is surrounded by the matter shell , regularity at the bh event horizon requires @xmath168 and @xmath169 inside the matter shell . for the same reason , at the cosmological horizon out of the matter shell , @xmath170 , which also demands @xmath171 there .",
    "so the scalar field can only be constants both inside and outside the matter shell",
    ". however , these two constants , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , can be different due to the existence of the matter shell .",
    "that is , there is a finite jump of the scalar field over the matter shell , which leads to a nontrivial configuration .",
    "this configuration is very different from that discussed in @xcite without cosmological horizon but only bh event horizon in the final spherical configuration , which does not have regularity condition out of the matter shell so that the scalar field @xmath164 is not limited to be a constant out of the shell and can develop a coordinate - dependent profile @xcite .    in our case , due to the constant profile of the scalar field inside and outside the matter shell , the final metric on both sides will take schwarzschild - de sitter forms but with different parameters @xmath174 .",
    "the cosmological constants @xmath175 on both sides are related to the scalar field by the relation @xmath176 .",
    "if the matter shell is made of perfect fluid , the surface stress - energy tensor takes the form @xmath177 where @xmath178 denote density and pressure respectively .",
    "@xmath179 is the on - shell four velocity and @xmath180 is the induced metric on the shell .",
    "according to the israel - darmois junction condition , the jump of the metric over the matter shell can be expressed in terms of the shell composition . in particular , for a static shell at @xmath181 , we have @xcite @xmath182    in summary , in spherical de sitter bh background , spontaneous scalarization can also happen but in a special style .",
    "we should note that the jump of the scalar field over the matter shell discussed above is due to the simplification of the thin shell . in a more realistic configuration",
    ", matter will have non - vanishing support as treated in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the stability of kerr - de sitter bh surrounded by matter shell in st theories .",
    "we have found that similar to the asymptotically flat kerr bh @xcite , there exists superradiant instability in the kerr - de sitter bh configurations .    in the kerr - de sitter bh background , we have observed that with the increase of the cosmological constant , the superradiant instability becomes harder to be triggered .",
    "it needs to put the matter shell closer to the hole and increase the coupling between the matter and scalar field to spark off the instability .",
    "we have got the physical understanding of the phenomenon we observed by examining the potential behavior .",
    "further , we have examined the influence of the angular momentum per unit mass on the superradiant instability .",
    "we have disclosed that slower rotation will make the superradiant instability harder to happen .",
    "there is a minimum value of the angular momentum per unit mass to allow the appearance of the superradiant instability .",
    "this minimum @xmath103 increases when the cosmological constant becomes bigger .",
    "the physical reasons behind this phenomenon have also been explained .    on the superradiant instability study ,",
    "the difference between asymptotically flat kerr black hole and kerr - de sitter bh is very little .",
    "the main reason is that the superradiant instability is mainly influenced by the potential barrier to reflect back the outgoing perturbation and the potential well between the bh horizon and the potential barrier to store the reflected perturbation .",
    "it has little to do with the boundary condition at the infinity for the asymptotically flat spacetime or at the cosmological horizon for the de sitter spacetime .",
    "we have also examined the spontaneous scalarization in the de sitter bh background .",
    "different from the superradiant instability , now the boundary at the cosmological horizon becomes important in the investigation .",
    "different from the asymptotically flat bh case @xcite , the regularity condition at the cosmological horizon enforces the scalarization to take a special style , that is the scalar field takes a constant profile outside the shell as well as inside the shell in the spherical de sitter bh background .",
    "since we only focused on the spherical de sitter configurations , one question we may ask is that whether a more general scalarization can happen once the de sitter bh background starts to rotate . further investigations on this topic are called for .",
