    ", we deal with the singularly perturbed nagumo - type equation @xmath6 where @xmath1 is a small parameter and @xmath2 is a locally integrable function satisfying @xmath7 notice that equation has the two constant solutions @xmath8 and @xmath9 which actually behave like saddle points ) ; we will be interested in the existence of solutions @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 for all @xmath4 .",
    "our investigation is motivated by a classical paper by angenent , mallet - paret and peletier @xcite , dealing with the neumann boundary value problem associated with in the framework of steady - states solutions of the corresponding parabolic problem ( which arises in population genetics ) . on the lines of previous works @xcite , in @xcite",
    "it is proved that , for @xmath5 small enough , the neumann boundary value problem associated with has multiple solutions , whose shape and limit profile ( for @xmath12 ) can be precisely described in terms of the zeros of the function @xmath13 .",
    "this analysis suggests that the dynamics of could be quite rich provided the function @xmath14 crosses the value @xmath15 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is indeed to prove the existence of solutions to defined on the whole real line and exhibiting complex behavior , when @xmath14 switches infinitely many times between two values @xmath16 with @xmath17 ( see , however , remark [ stabile ] for possible generalizations of the above assumption ) . more precisely , we will provide solutions of essentially two types .",
    "on one hand , we find the existence of globally defined solutions rotating ( in the phase - plane ) a certain number of times around @xmath18 in suitable intervals @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) ( solutions of this kind will be called _ chaotic _ ) ; the number of revolutions can be arbitrarily prescribed and @xmath21 is unbounded from below and from above , i.e. , solutions oscillate infinitely many times on the whole real line .",
    "in particular , if @xmath14 is @xmath22-periodic for some @xmath23 , we find the existence of subharmonic solutions to with complex behavior ; indeed , one could show that the poincar map associated with on a period is topologically semiconjugated to the bernoulli shift on a suitable number of symbols ( as in @xcite , see also remark [ coniugio ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we are able to produce _ homoclinic _ and _ heteroclinic _ solutions , having the same nodal behavior as before on bounded intervals of arbitrarily large length and converging monotonically to one of the equilibria @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .    a similar nonlinearity is considered in the recent papers . however , those papers deal with situations which can be considered in a certain sense dual to ours , since they have a fixed central equilibrium ( a center , in fact ) while the two nearby saddle points move according to a suitable piecewise constant weight function .",
    "moreover , we decided to focus on finding solutions that are obtained by exploiting quite different configurations than those investigated in the mentioned papers , and to omit the details in cases that are similar to those already treated ( see remark [ linkinginterno ] ) .",
    "for the proof of our results , we use the change of variable @xmath27 , so that the equivalent planar system associated with is transformed into @xmath28 hence , the smallness of @xmath1 reflects into the fact that the function @xmath29 is constant on intervals of large amplitude . as a consequence , can be regarded as a slowly varying perturbation of an autonomous system with two hyperbolic equilibrium points ; in this setting , the arising of rich dynamics seems to be a quite common phenomenum ( see , among others , @xcite as well as the bibliography in @xcite ) . in order to detect such a complex behavior , we use a dynamical systems approach , based on a careful analysis of the trajectories of the ( piecewise autonomous ) system .",
    "more in detail , we first rely on a topological technique of path stretching ( the so - called sap method ) developed in @xcite to detect the presence of symbolic dynamics ( as well as of periodic points , when @xmath14 is periodic ) for suitable poincar maps associated with . as a by - product",
    ", this approach also provides us planar paths which can be used to connect the stable and unstable manifolds of the equilibria so as to obtain heteroclinic and homoclinic solutions with a complex nodal behavior ( see , among others , @xcite and the references therein for related results in this direction ) .",
    "it has to be noticed that , since the equation is non - autonomous , the existence of the stable / unstable manifolds is not straightforward ; we use indeed the classical conley - waewski s method @xcite ( see also ) to prove that these sets actually exist and can be suitably localized .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the autonomous case . in section [ sec3 ] , we prove some stretching properties , as well as the existence of stable and unstable manifolds to the equilibria . in section [ sec4 ] , we state and",
    "prove our main results .",
    "finally , some basic facts about sap method are collected in a final appendix .",
    ".2 .    in this section we collect some basic results for the autonomous equation @xmath30 where @xmath14 is a real constant such that @xmath31 precisely , we are going to perform a phase - plane analysis for the equivalent planar system @xmath32 we will always confine our attention to the dynamics in the vertical strip @xmath33 \\times \\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "it is immediately seen that the points @xmath24 , @xmath34 and @xmath25 are the only equilibrium points of . to proceed further",
    ", we define the function @xmath35 where @xmath36 as well - known , system is conservative and the function @xmath37 is constant along solutions @xmath38 to . to describe the global dynamics of , we can thus study the geometry of the level sets @xmath39 for different values of @xmath40 .",
    "it turns out that the value of the constant @xmath14 plays a significant role .",
    "we start by analyzing the case @xmath41 which indeed gives rise to the simplest picture .",
    "precisely , the level set @xmath39 can here be described as follows :    * for @xmath42 , it is the point @xmath34 ; * for @xmath43 , it is a closed cycle around @xmath34 ; * for @xmath44 , it is the union of the points @xmath24 , @xmath25 and of the heteroclinic orbits joining them ; * for @xmath45 , it is the union of two curves , one in the half - plane @xmath46 , one in the half - plane @xmath47 , connecting two points of the form @xmath48 and @xmath49 for some @xmath50 .    the phase - portrait is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case @xmath51 now , for the level set @xmath39 we have the following :    * for @xmath42 , it is the point @xmath34 ; * for @xmath43 , it is a closed cycle around @xmath34 ; * for @xmath44 , it is the union of the point @xmath24 and its homoclinic orbit @xmath52 ; for further convenience , we denote by @xmath53 the point of intersection between @xmath52 and the positive @xmath54-semiaxis ; * for @xmath55 , it is made by a curve lying between the homoclinic to @xmath24 and the stable / unstable manifold @xmath56 of @xmath25 , connecting a point of the form @xmath48 with a point of the form @xmath57 , for some @xmath58 ; * for @xmath59 , it is the union of the point @xmath25 and its stable / unstable manifolds ; * for @xmath60 , it is the union of two curves , one in the half - plane @xmath46 , one in the half - plane @xmath47 , connecting a point of the form @xmath48 with a point of the form @xmath61 , for some @xmath62 .    finally , for @xmath63 the phase - portrait can be obtained from the previous one with a symmetry with respect to the line @xmath64 .",
    "the homoclinic orbit and the stable / unstable manifolds are defined in an analogous way , by swapping @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and will be again denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath65 ; moreover , @xmath53 will be the point of intersection between @xmath52 and the positive @xmath54-semiaxis .",
    "both the phase - portraits are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "[ bilanciato ] from the above discussion , it appears that the phase - portrait of system is completely different in the case @xmath66 and in the case @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , the heteroclinc orbit connecting @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath66 disappear as soon as @xmath67 , splitting into orbits of different type . in terms of the potential @xmath68 , we have indeed @xmath69 if and only if @xmath66 ; in this case , the potential is said to be balanced . in this context , can be framed in the setting of equations with unbalanced potentials ( compare with the introduction in @xcite ) .",
    ".3 .    in this section we collect the preliminary technical lemmas which will be used in the proof of our main results .      in this section ,",
    "we fix two reals constants @xmath16 satisfying @xmath17 our goal is to prove some results for the dynamics of the autonomous system for @xmath70 and @xmath71 on suitable sets which will be constructed below . throughout this section",
