    "there has been a continued interest in a class of compounds called kondo insulators or heavy fermion semiconductors,@xcite which develop an insulating gap at low temperatures via strong correlation effects .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are well known examples , which possess small gaps of the order of 1 - 100 mev in spin and charge excitations .",
    "the gap formation in kondo insulators is attributed to the renormalized hybridization between a broad conduction band and a nearly flat @xmath5-electron band with strong correlations . in some kondo insulators , enhanced antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations among localized @xmath5-moments",
    "dominate the kondo singlet formation , resulting in an af long - range order.@xcite systems located around such magnetic instability provide hot topics in quantum critical phenomena.@xcite    the application of a magnetic field to the kondo insulators also realizes quantum critical phenomena , which have been investigated extensively . experiments on @xmath6@xcite @xmath7@xcite and @xmath4@xcite in high magnetic fields",
    "indicate closure of the kondo - insulating gap , exemplifying a transition from the kondo insulator to a correlated metal .",
    "if the kondo insulator is in the proximity of magnetic instability , the local singlet formation gets weak , and the applied field may possibly trigger a phase transition to the af ordered state before it becomes a metal .    the periodic anderson model ( pam ) at half filling may be a simplified model to describe the kondo insulating phase@xcite and the af phase , depending on the @xmath8-@xmath5 hybridization strength @xmath9 and the @xmath5-@xmath5 coulomb interaction @xmath10 .",
    "the magnetic instability of the pam has been investigated by means of various methods such as slave - boson mean field theory@xcite and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite the effect of the magnetic field on the pam has also been investigated,@xcite and the phase transition from the kondo insulator to a paramagnetic metal , which is naively expected , has been discussed .",

    "also , a detailed study including the paramagnetic phase at finite temperatures is expected to provide further interesting properties in the kondo insulator in a magnetic field .    in this paper , we study field - induced af phase transitions of the kondo insulator in the whole temperature regime by using the pam at half filling . by exploiting dmft combined with the qmc method,@xcite we show that a magnetic field induces a transverse af order in the kondo insulator .",

    "we consider the hyper - cubic lattice with a bipartite property in infinite dimensions .",
    "the bare density of states for @xmath8 electrons is gaussian with the width @xmath21 : @xmath22/\\sqrt{\\pi t^{*2}}$ ] .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath23 applied along the @xmath24 direction is coupled to both of the @xmath8 and @xmath5 electrons .",
    "we assume that the @xmath25 factors of the @xmath8 and @xmath5 electrons are the same , and set @xmath26 .",
    "these simplifications would not qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "dmft is a powerful framework to study strongly correlated electron systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , the single - band hubbard model , the two - band hubbard model , the pam , etc .",
    "this method is justified in the limit of large spatial dimensions and gives a rather good approximation even in three dimensions . in dmft ,",
    "the proper one - particle self - energy , which is independent of the momentum , is obtained via an effective impurity model embedded in a self - consistently determined medium .",
    "the dmft treatment of the pam is summarized in appendix a. we solve the effective impurity model using the qmc method with the trotter time slices , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the number of qmc sweeps is @xmath29 in each dmft iteration loop .",
    "we use the typical parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the following calculation . for these parameters ,",
    "the ground state at zero field is a paramagnetic kondo insulator , as shown by jarrell _ et .",
    "al._@xcite it is convenient to express the energy normalized by the zero field value of quasi - particle gap , @xmath32 , which is estimated from the @xmath5-electron spectral function at @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we first give an overview of the phase diagram obtained in this paper , which is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . at weak fields ,",
    "the system is in the kondo insulating phase characterized by the gap formation of quasi - particle states , which is smoothly connected to the high - temperature paramagnetic phase . beyond a certain critical field",
    ", there is a second - order phase transition from the paramagnetic phase to the low - temperature af phase with the decrease of temperature .",
    "the af phase possesses a long - range order in the @xmath34 plane , namely , the transverse af order .",
    "it is seen that the transition temperature @xmath0 takes a maximum , when the zeeman energy is nearly equal to the spin gap @xmath35 . around this field",
    ", we find remarkable properties in the paramagnetic phase just above @xmath0 : they are characterized by two crossover fields , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the quasi - particle gap is closed for fields higher than @xmath36 . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the magnetization of the @xmath8 electrons changes its sign .",
    "the region surrounded by @xmath0 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 may be referred to as a ` kondo metal ' , where the quasi - particle gap is closed but the kondo correlations are still dominant to produce the strong renormalization effects accompanied by the large mass enhancement . as a result ,",
    "this kondo - metal region exhibits interesting properties coming from the competition of the kondo correlations , the af instability , etc .",
    "we now explain how the above phase diagram is obtained in the dmft framework .",
    "we first investigate the field - induced af transitions , and then discuss some characteristic properties in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "an af transition is signaled by the divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility @xmath38 with @xmath39 $ ] , where the suffix @xmath40 denotes the direction perpendicular to the field . in dmft",
    ", we can calculate this quantity via the impurity model , since the irreducible vertex function as well as the self - energy is independent of the momentum in infinite dimensions.@xcite the detail of the calculation is summarized in appendix b.     with @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "inset shows the inverse of the susceptibility for @xmath5 electrons @xmath41 .",
    "both of @xmath42 and @xmath43 diverge at the same critical temperature .",
    "@xmath41 is well fitted with the form @xmath44 , which enables us to determine the transition temperature @xmath0 by a proper extrapolation procedure.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the staggered spin susceptibility @xmath45 is plotted as a function of temperature for different magnetic fields . in the dmft framework ,",
    "the susceptibility exhibits mean - field behavior , @xmath46^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , we evaluate the transition temperature rather accurately by extrapolating the inverse susceptibility to zero as a function of @xmath47 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the transition temperature @xmath0 thus obtained for various values of @xmath23",
    "is plotted in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic field triggers a phase transition from the paramagnetic kondo insulator to the transverse af ordered state .",
    "the critical field between the kondo insulator and the af insulator is estimated as @xmath48 at @xmath49 . in our calculation",
    ", it is somewhat difficult to precisely determine the higher critical field separating the af phase and the paramagnetic metallic phase at @xmath49 , since the signal of antiferromagnetism appears at very low temperature with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "milat _ et . al .",
    "_ concluded that the af state should persist up to the fully polarized state because of perfect nesting.@xcite our numerical results support their conclusion , although such a transition would occur at extremely low temperatures in the high field regime .",
    "it is instructive to note that the transition temperature @xmath0 takes a maximum value @xmath51 around the field @xmath52 , which is almost the same as the spectral gap , @xmath53 .",
    "we will see that this value of field is close to two typical crossover fields discussed below .",
    "we obtain dynamical quantities by applying the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to the imaginary - time qmc data computed with dmft . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the one - particle spectral functions for the @xmath8 and @xmath5 electrons , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , at @xmath56 for different magnetic fields .",
    "note that the system is in the paramagnetic phase for any magnetic fields at this temperature .",
    "one can see in this figure how the magnetic filed closes the quasi - particle gap and then induces correlated metallic states . at @xmath57 ,",
    "the well - defined insulating gap exists both for @xmath5 and @xmath8 electrons . as the field is increased ( @xmath58 ) , the peak structure existing beside the gap is slightly shifted in the presence of the zeeman splitting . for @xmath59 , the spectral gap almost disappears . a remarkable point in this case",
    "is that @xmath5 electrons get another sharp peak structure around @xmath60 , as seen for the third panel in fig .",
    "this implies that strong kondo correlations still persist even in such fields , driving the system to a correlated metallic state ( kondo metal in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) immediately after the quasi - particle gap is closed by the field .",
    "if the field is further increased , such a sharp quasi - particle peak disappears , and the system gradually changes to an ordinary paramagnetic metal with the spin polarization .",
    "in order to see the above characteristics clearly , we show the @xmath5-electron spectral weight at the fermi level , @xmath61/2 $ ] , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) as a function of the magnetic field at different temperatures",
    ". it may be legitimate to define the crossover field @xmath36 characterizing the gap - closing by the field where @xmath62 takes its maximum as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the crossover field thus estimated , @xmath63 , is consistent with the known results that the spin gap is nearly equal to the quasi - particle gap in infinite dimensions.@xcite it is seen that @xmath36 is almost independent of the temperature in the range shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "as a reference , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) we show the numerical derivative of the @xmath5-electron self - energy , @xmath64 , which would correspond to the inverse of the mass - enhancement factor at low temperatures .",
    "it is seen that @xmath65 indeed takes its maximum around the field @xmath36 , which seems consistent with the development of the sharp quasi - particle peak in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . however , one notices that the mass enhancement ( i.e. development of the sharp peak ) observed around @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is larger than that in fig . [",

    "this formula may not pick up the sharp structure of the spectrum around @xmath68 in fig .",

    "@xmath64 is computed numerically by the formula @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    ", width=302 ]    we further calculate the dynamical spin - correlation function to directly observe the magnetic - field effects on spin excitations .",
    "the imaginary - time spin - correlation function @xmath72 , defined as @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , is calculated by the qmc method and is analytically continued to the real frequency with mem . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show the field dependence of @xmath76 at a given temperature , @xmath77 , slightly larger than the maximum af transition temperature .    at zero field , there are two characteristic features in the dynamical spin - correlation functions .",
    "one is a low - energy peak ( shoulder ) structure in @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) due to spin - triplet excitations , which determine the size of the spin gap .",
    "the other is a broad continuum in the high - energy region due to the dispersion of @xmath8 electrons , which features a higher - energy hump in @xmath79 .",
    "when a magnetic field is introduced , the spin - triplet excitations split into three distinct excitations specified by @xmath80 . at @xmath58 ,",
    "the magnetic field little affects the shape of @xmath81 , whereas it splits the low - energy peak of @xmath82 into two sub - peaks .",
    "the results are naturally understood , because the triplet excitations observed in @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) are those with @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) : the latter causes the splitting in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "if the field is further increased , the spin gap disappears around @xmath68 , making the kondo singlet state unstable .",
    "note that around this field , @xmath85 develops another hump structure around @xmath86 , which is consistent with the fact that heavy - fermion states with the enhanced mass appear in the one - particle spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "another noticeable point is that @xmath87 does not increase its weight around @xmath86 , although @xmath88 as well as @xmath89 already has a reasonable weight ( see data at @xmath90 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath87 eventually develops a shoulder - like structure around @xmath86 at @xmath91 , where the heavy - fermion behavior in @xmath85 is already suppressed . in this way",

    "( a ) and @xmath8 ( b ) electrons . @xmath93 and @xmath94 are defined by @xmath95 and @xmath96 . ,",
    "width=302 ]    to make the above point clear , we turn to another interesting crossover behavior denoted by the line @xmath37 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) in the paramagnetic phase above @xmath0 .",
    "this line is determined by the change in the magnetization process for @xmath8 electrons . shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are the magnetization of @xmath5 and @xmath8 electrons at several different temperatures .",
    "it is found that the magnetization of @xmath5 electrons is always positive , while that of @xmath8 electrons is negative for weak fields and gets positive beyond a certain magnetic field .",
    "we define @xmath37 by the magnetic field at which the magnetization of @xmath8 electrons changes its sign .",
    "this field @xmath37 roughly corresponds to the strength of the local singlet formation . at weak fields ,",
    "the kondo effect is still dominant to align the spins of @xmath8 and @xmath5 electrons in the opposite directions , which may give rise to the negative magnetization in @xmath8 electrons .",
    "such nonmonotonic behavior is also seen in the spectral function of @xmath8 electrons in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the spectral function of @xmath8 electrons with up spin is shifted to the low - energy side , while its weight is considerably suppressed .",
    "these results are also consistent with what we have observed in the small-@xmath97 behavior of @xmath98 for @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    summarizing the results found in the normal phase",
    ", we can say that around the field where @xmath0 takes a maximum , various correlation effects such as the kondo - gap formation , the af instability , etc . compete with each other , yielding characteristic properties in correlated electrons .",
    "such features are different from ordinary heavy fermions without magnetic fields .",
    "we have investigated the effects of the magnetic field on the kondo insulator by applying dmft to the pam at finite temperatures .",
    "there are several characteristic features in the phase diagram . at low temperatures ,",
    "we have observed the quantum phase transition from the kondo insulator to the transverse af phase , in accordance with the results obtained in the two - dimensional case . we have also found some remarkable properties in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "namely , in the paramagnetic phase close to the maximum af transition temperature , heavy - fermion states with the enhanced mass are realized , where the competition of the magnetic field and the kondo correlations results in characteristic features in the one - particle spectrum , the dynamical spin susceptibility and the magnetization process .",
    "it may be interesting to experimentally investigate static as well as dynamical properties in this region .",
