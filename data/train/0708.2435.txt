    "the physical behaviour of a single magnetic impurity interacting with a large number of conduction electrons has been , and continues to be , a fascinating subject of inquiry for over four decades .",
    "the emergence of a strong correlation between the impurity and the conduction electrons at low temperatures , first predicted by jun kondo  @xcite , gives rise to the well - known kondo effect wherein the impurity is effectively screened by forming a singlet with the surrounding electrons .",
    "much still remains to be understood regarding strongly correlated quantum many - body physics .",
    "the kondo effect , as a well understood example of a strongly correlated phenomenon , has proven to be a fertile topic for further study in this important field  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the study of these magnetic impurity systems has seen a resurgence due to the great advances in experimental technology that allow one to construct , control , and manipulate objects on the nanometer scale . in particular , the kondo effect has been observed in numerous experiments involving quantum dots constructed in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , as well as in systems where a magnetic atom is placed on the surface of metal  @xcite .",
    "both of these systems involve a local moment , either that of an odd number of localized electrons ( as in the quantum dot ) or of a partially filled outer shell of an atom interacting with mobile electrons confined to move in two dimensions .",
    "the confining potential breaks the inversion symmetry that is manifest in the conduction electrons and gives rise to a coupling between their spin and momentum  @xcite . such spin - orbit coupling ( coined as rashba spin - orbit coupling to differentiate it from coupling arising from other mechanisms which may break the inversion symmetry ) has been analyzed theoretically and observed experimentally in both semiconductor quantum wells  @xcite and in metallic surface states  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a spin - orbit coupling means that the @xmath2 symmetry of the conductions electrons is no longer present and that the spin of the electrons is no longer an eigenstate of the system .",
    "given this fact , it seems , at first , remarkable that the kondo effect , which depends crucially on the magnetic exchange interaction between the local moment and the spin of the conduction electrons , is observed at all in such two dimensional systems .",
    "this issue was first examined in  @xcite where it was shown that the presence of time reversal symmetry in the kondo interaction term preserves the spin coherence of the electron propagator .",
    "that is , although spin is no longer a `` good '' quantum number , the scattering trajectories of the electron that would destroy its spin coherence in multiple interactions with the impurity are exactly cancelled by the time reversed paths .",
    "while such a powerful argument may explain why the kondo effect survives the apparent breaking of spin coherence , it is not precise enough to determine the change in the low energy behaviour of such impurity systems in the presence of a spin - orbit coupling in general . a more detailed calculation is required in order to gain such information",
    ".    there have been several studies that have investigated the role of spin - orbit effects in specific semiconductor mesoscopic devices where the kondo effect is manifest  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction either takes place within a quantum dot coupled to conducting leads or within one dimensional wires , often coupled to a localized magnetic moment . in this paper",
    ", we derive a model to study the effect that the rashba spin - orbit coupling has on the low energy behaviour of a _ two _ dimensional system with a magnetic impurity",
    ". the generic nature of the derived model may not be as readily applicable to the analysis of a specific experiment as those cited above , but it does have the advantage of elucidating some general features of the physical interplay between the kondo and rashba interactions that might be less transparent in more complicated quantum dot studies .",
    "the model is presented in   [ sec : models ] and an effective model relevent to the study of the low energy behaviour is derived .",
    "the analysis of the effective model suggests that a more physical property of the system should be calculated in order to get a better sense of how the spin - orbit coupling influences its behaviour . in   [ sec : resistivity ] , the resistivity of the full two dimensional model is calculated and compared to kondo s classic result  @xcite . the combination of this result together with an analysis of the effective model leads to various conclusions and predictions which are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] .    throughout the analysis we use the following conventions : vector quantities",
    "are represented by a boldface character and the same character without boldface denotes the vector s magnitude .",
    "repeated greek indices are assumed to be summed over unless one of them is enclosed in brackets .",
    "finally , we work in units in which @xmath3 except when estimating the values of certain quantities in which case the precise units will be given .",
    "we first consider electrons confined to travel in the @xmath4 plane as the result of some non - constant electric potential in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the motion of the electrons in the presence of this electric field gives rise to a coupling between the spin of the electron and its momentum , which can be expressed by the rashba hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath6 our notation is as follows : @xmath7 is the effective mass of the electron , @xmath8 is the operator that annihilates an electron of momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 and satisfies the anticommutation relationship @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the strength of the rashba coupling which is proportional to the derivative of the electric potential in the @xmath5 direction , and @xmath13 are the pauli matrices so that @xmath14 is twice the @xmath15 component of the spin of the electron .",
    "this hamiltonian can easily be diagonalized to be of the form @xmath16 the rashba bands are non - degenerate and take the form @xmath17 where we have defined the rashba momentum scale @xmath18 and the corresponding rashba energy scale @xmath19 .",
    "the relationship between the operators that create particles in these rashba bands and the original electron operators is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angle of the momentum @xmath22 in polar coordinates and the normalization has been chosen such that @xmath23 .    now consider a spin-1/2 magnetic impurity at the origin , described by the spin operator @xmath24 .",
    "we write the interaction between this spin and the electrons using the so - called s - d exchange hamiltonian or kondo hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the two dimensional volume of the system .",
    "this interaction can be thought of as arising from an anderson impurity model  @xcite of a two dimensional fermi gas interacting with a localized electronic state with strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "the details of this relationship ( in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ) are discussed in appendix  [ app : anderson ] where the specific form for @xmath27 is derived for various models of the hybridization between the local state and the electronic fermi gas .    in the absence of rashba spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the physics of the kondo hamiltonian is very well known  @xcite . in the case of a ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath28 ) between the impurity and the electrons",

    "if the exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic , then there exists a temperature scale @xmath1 , the so - called kondo temperature , below which the magnetic impurity is screened by forming a singlet with the surrounding electrons .",
    "many low - energy properties can then be derived ( using a variety of techniques depending on the temperature regime ) and most can be shown to depend on universal scaling functions of @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "for the case where the interaction occurs at a single point , @xmath30 and the kondo temperature can be expressed to lowest order in @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the density of states evaluated at the fermi energy and @xmath34 is an effective bandwidth .    in semiconductor quantum dots ,",
    "the value of the kondo temperature is tunable though the maximum value is set by the size of the dot : the smaller the dot , the larger the temperature . in this way ,",
    "kondo temperatures as high as 1 k have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "the kondo temperature of a magnetic atom on a metallic surface can span quite a wide range depending on the nature of the impurity atom and which metallic surface is used . in the case of a co atom on au(111 ) , a kondo temperature of @xmath35 k has been measured  @xcite .    to describe a system with both a kondo impurity and rashba spin - orbit coupling , we can use eq .",

    "the simplest form for the exchange interaction is to consider that it occurs at a single point .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ app : anderson ] , this means that @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", decomposing the operators into their different angular components reveals that only a finite number of angular modes couple to the impurity .",
    "we first investigate the kondo interaction in the absence of spin - oribt coupling . with @xmath44 and @xmath21 being the amplitude and angle of the momentum @xmath22",
    ", we can write @xmath45 and using the orthonormality of @xmath46 this implies that @xmath47 we have included the prefactors of @xmath48 here so that the polar components @xmath49 of @xmath50 behave as ordinary fermionic operators @xmath51 . in terms of these angular components , the kondo interaction  ( [ kondofull ] ) can be written as @xmath52 that is , the kondo interaction is effectively a one - dimensional interaction , and all higher harmonics decouple from the impurity .    in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling , it is convenient to write the kondo interaction in terms of the operators that create and annihilate rashba quasi - particles .",
    "first we define the following operators , which are directly related to the @xmath53 and @xmath54 angular components of the @xmath55 operators respectively @xmath56 these satisfy the usual fermionic anti - commutation relations @xmath57 . by combining eq .",

    "hence , we may write the kondo - rashba hamiltonian as a one dimensional model @xmath61 this has the form of a two channel kondo model with off - diagonal couplings , where each channel has a different dispersion relation and the coupling with the impurity is the same between each of the channels . in this expression ,",
    "the greek indices no longer refer to the spin of the electron but , instead , a combination of the spin and orbital angular degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by writing the @xmath62 in terms of the angular modes of the electrons  ( [ harmcomp ] ) @xmath63    since we are interested only in the low energy properties of the kondo - rashba model at this stage , we can focus only on the quasi - particle excitations close to the fermi energy .",

    "for one , the imposition of rotational invariance in the plain of the electron gas is clearly not present in the complicated gated structures that are manufactured in the laboratory . in our calculation of the resistivity",

    "it was shown that the kondo effect is supressed only when the impurity is close to a boundary and , hence , the rotational isotropy of the system is broken .",
    "the second reason why our analysis fails in the case of semi - conductor quantum dots is the relative strength of the energy scales . in particular ,",

    "this is generally smaller than the typical values of the fermi energy in the two dimensional electron gas of the semi - conductor heterostructure ( typically @xmath173  ev  @xcite ) , completely negating our necessary assumption that @xmath124 .",
    "this suggests that a more accurate model is required to study the kondo effect with rashba coupling in quantum dots , some examples of which have already been studied  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the fermi energy is generally much larger for the surface state electrons than in the semiconductor two dimensional electron gas ( @xmath174 ev for typical metallic surfaces ) making it much more likely that the length scale over which the magnetic atom hybridizes with the conduction electrons is such that @xmath124 .",
    "indeed , assuming that such a hybridization takes place over the observed size of the impurity atom , a radius of @xmath175  @xcite , then @xmath176 .    as a result",
    ", one could imagine detecting a change in the kondo temperature as a result of the rashba spin - orbit coupling by measuring the kondo temperature of the same magnetic atom on different metallic surfaces with different strengths of the rashba coupling .",
    "this is likely to be terribly difficult to detect given that the change due to spin - orbit coupling is typically very small , being linear in @xmath177 ( @xmath178 for the case of an au(111 ) surface and immeasurable in cu(111 ) and ag(111 )  @xcite ) .",
    "such an effect is likely to be overwhelmed by other differences between the two systems .",
    "a clearer signature of this effect could be seen if one were able to tune the rashba coupling independently from the fermi energy , something that has been demonstrated in semi - conductor heterostructures  @xcite but not for the coupling in metallic surface electrons .",
    "hence , for the purposes of observing this effect , it may be worth pursuing a more realistic model of a quantum dot system in such a two dimensional electron gas where one has the ability to tune the rashba coupling .    as was demonstrated in  @xcite , the presence of time reversal symmetry plays a fundamental role in the survival of the kondo effect in the presence of spin - orbit interactions . another interesting question to pursue",
    "is how the presence of a magnetic field , which breaks time reversal invariance , can be incorporated into the models introduced above and how such a field modifies the results .",
    "i would like to thank ian affleck , andrea damascelli , rodrigo pereira , and fei zhou for useful discussions and input during the course of this work .",
    "i would also like to acknowledge the national science and engineering research council of canada for their support .",
    "here , we review the schrieffer - wolff transformation of an anderson impurity model without spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the purpose is to highlight how a finite range hybridization between the impurity state and the non - interacting conduction electrons manifests itself in the resulting kondo interaction .",
    "it is that kondo interaction that is then used as input into the two dimensional kondo - rashba model studied in this paper .",
    "the kondo model used in this paper can be thought of as deriving from the anderson impurity model  @xcite of an impurity electronic state annihilated by @xmath179 interacting with a sea of conduction electrons annihilated by @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model can be written as @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "the hybridization between the impurity and conduction electrons is chosen to take the following form @xmath182 here , @xmath26 is the two dimensional volume of the system , h.c .  denotes the hermitian conjugate of the preceeding term and @xmath166 is the fourier transform of an `` envelope function '' @xmath183 that describes the extent over which the impurity interacts with the conduction electrons",
    "this envelope function has the property that its maximum is at the origin , that it only depends on the distance from the origin ( _ i.e. _  it is circularly symmetric ) , and that it decays to zero after some characteristic length scale @xmath98 .",
    "one can perform a canonical transformation , the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite , perturbatively in @xmath184 , to obtain the s - d or kondo model @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the operator of the impurity electron and @xmath187.\\ ] ] a potential scattering term is also generated but is neglected in our analysis as it does not play a crucial role in determining spin - orbit effects . if we are deep in the so - called local - moment regime where the singly and doubly occupied impurity levels are equally spaced below and above the fermi energy ( _ i.e. _  @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) then we can simplify the above to @xmath190    the traditional choice in most theoretical analysis is to take @xmath191 , which is the fourier transform of a delta function in position space and corresponds to having a point - like interaction .",
    "this is the form of the envelope we will use in   [ sec : effmod ] .",
    "however , in ",
    "[ sec : resistivity ] , it will be necessary to make the range of interaction finite in order to provide a more physical ultra - violet cutoff .",
    "so , for ease of computation , we take @xmath95 which corresponds to a position space envelope function @xmath192 with @xmath193 being the bessel functions of the 1st kind .",
    "such a function has an effective range of @xmath194 .",
    "in this appendix , we generalize the standard boltzmann theory of transport , as described in  @xcite , for example , to the case where there are multiple bands , @xmath195 , that are not necessarily degenerate .",
    "consider such a system in the presence of a weak static electric field @xmath196 .",
    "this will give rise to a distribution function , @xmath197 , for each band .",
    "the time rate of change is assumed to satisfy the relaxation hypothesis @xmath198 where @xmath199 , the fermi - dirac distribution . assuming that such time rate of change only comes about via the change in momentum @xmath22 as a function of time",
    ", then we can equate the above to @xmath200 .",
    "working to first order in @xmath201 yields @xmath202 with @xmath103 being the band velocity .",
    "to calculate the relaxation time , we introduce the scattering rate between the state @xmath113 and @xmath205 given by fermi s golden rule @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the t - matrix as introduced in   [ sec : resistivity ] .    the rate of change of the distribution function @xmath197 due to impurity interactions",
    "can then be obtained by summing over all possible transitions of the state @xmath113 : @xmath208 \\end{array } \\\\ & & = - 2 \\pi c_{\\mathrm{imp } } \\int \\frac{d^d k^\\prime}{(2 \\pi)^d } \\sum_{a^\\prime } \\left\\langle \\left| t_{{\\boldsymbol}{k } a , { \\boldsymbol}{k}^\\prime a^\\prime } \\right|^2 \\right\\rangle \\left ( f_e^a({\\boldsymbol}{k } ) - f_e^{a^\\prime}({\\boldsymbol}{k}^\\prime ) \\right ) \\delta ( { \\varepsilon}_k^a - { \\varepsilon}_{k^\\prime}^{a^\\prime } ) , \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath209 being the concentration of impurities . equating this to @xmath210 and using eq .",
    "( [ feapprox ] ) results in the expression @xmath211    specializing now to two dimensions , we assume that @xmath212 is at most linear in @xmath22 ( which is true for the rashba bands studied in this paper ) , that the t - matrix depends only on the angle between its two input momentum , and that the t - matrix is symmetric in that angle .",
    "these allow us to make the following substitution within the integrand above @xmath213 where @xmath21 is the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath196 and @xmath109 is the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath110 .",
    "the reason this works is that the sine term that would also be included in the expression for the dot product vanishes after integrating over the angular variable . using this substitution we can extract an expression for the scattering rate @xmath214 this",
