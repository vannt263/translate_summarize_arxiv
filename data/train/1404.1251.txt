    "hyperbolic metamaterials ( hmms ) are composite media that consist of subwavelength structures assembled so that an extreme anisotropy results on the macroscopic scale , with metallic behavior arising for one polarization of light and dielectric behavior for the other . in other words ,",
    "their permittivity tensor @xmath1 has eigenvalues of different signs ( e.g. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the uniaxial geometry ) .",
    "such anisotropy results in the dispersion relation in such a medium @xmath4 that is hyperbolic rather than elliptical ( fig .",
    "1a ) , hence the name of hmms .",
    "a hyperboloidal isofrequency surface is much more extended in the wave vector space than an ellipsoidal one  indeed , theoretically infinite in the idealization that eq",
    ".   holds for all @xmath5  so an hmm supports propagating solutions with very large wave vectors ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these waves , called high-@xmath0 waves for short @xcite , would be extremely evanescent in any natural isotropic or weakly birefringent medium but become propagating in hmms .",
    "the existence of high-@xmath0 waves brings about a rich variety of new physics , both related to the waves themselves ( as highly confined information carriers for subwavelength imaging @xcite ) and associated with a tremendous increase in the photonic density of states ( pdos ) in hmms , resulting in strong modification of all light - matter interaction phenomena that depend on it , such as spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "what truly sparked the explosive scientific interest during the past few years was the discovery that hmm functionality can be exhibited in a non - resonant , broadband manner by structures with very simple geometry , such as nanorod arrays @xcite and metal - dielectric multilayers @xcite .",
    "an anomalous increase of the decay rate of nearby emitting centers ( a broadband purcell effect ) was demonstrated experimentally @xcite , along with the direct measurement of radiation enhancement @xcite .",
    "many applications of hmms have ben suggested , such as far - field subwavelength imaging or `` hyperlensing '' @xcite and highly absorptive surfaces that benefit ( rather than suffer ) from increased roughness @xcite .",
    "more fundamental and more intriguing uses for hmms have also been envisaged , exploiting mathematical similarities between sign changes in the dispersion relation and metric signature transitions in cosmological equations @xcite .",
    "many more areas of research are being explored , as can be seen in the recent reviews @xcite and references therein .    even though the effective permittivity representation of hmms has proved very successful in predicting and explaining their exotic physics , it is the high-@xmath0 waves that govern the functioning of any hmm on a microscopic level .",
    "hence it is these waves that eventually determine the extents and limits of applicability of a particular hmm with respect to any of the effects described above .",
    "thus , it is crucial to understand the physical nature of these waves . in metal - dielectric structures ,",
    "the conventional wisdom is that the nature is plasmonic , so various groups have chosen different terms for them : _ multilayer plasmons _",
    "@xcite , _ bloch plasmon polaritons _",
    "@xcite , or _",
    "volume plasmon polaritons _ ( vpps ) @xcite . in hmms with a multilayer geometry ,",
    "vpps should arise from coupling of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) at layer interfaces @xcite . in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we showed explicitly that vpps originate from coupling of short - range spps ( srspps ) in individual metal layers by keeping only the srspp response in these layers via a pole expansion .",

    "( b ) an infinite periodic multilayer hmm with geometric notations and wave vector decomposition used in the paper , along with the illustration of the replacement of real metal layers with reflection and transmission coefficients given by eq .   with fictitious layers featuring just a pole - like elementary excitation with reflection and transmission coefficients given by eq .  .",
    "( c ) comparison between the actual multilayer dispersion relation [ eq .  ,",
    "the dispersion relation derived from the pole expansion [ eq .  , and the effective - medium dispersion relation [ eq .   with eq .   for the structure with layer thicknesses",

    "[ fig : schematic ] ]    two interesting observations were made alongside this proof .",
    "first , it appeared that there is a stark contrast between the two characteristic excitation in the metal layer : the short - range spp capable of giving rise to hmm behavior , and the long - range spp ( lrspp ) that do not have such a capability .",
    "second , as also mentioned in other accounts @xcite , vpps were shown to exist outside of the hmm regime , albeit in a somewhat narrower band in the wave vector space .",
    "the general principle , namely , `` lower - dimensional elementary unit cell excitations coupling form a higher - dimensional excitation in a periodic arrangement of such cells '' is undoubtedly behind the formation of vpps in multilayer hmms .",
    "nevertheless , it still remains to be determined what conditions these elementary excitations must satisfy to form a high-@xmath0 band spanning a broad range of @xmath0 , such as happens in vpps .",
    "a general understanding would be very useful in determining the applicability range for new types of hmms , such as , for example , graphene - based multilayers introduced in recent works @xcite .    in this paper , *",
    "* we theoretically investigate general existence conditions for broadband bulk high-@xmath0 propagating waves ( such as vpps in hmms ) in arbitrary periodic multilayers structures .",
    "we treat the elementary excitation in the unit cell of such a structure as a generalized resonance defined by a pole - like response in its fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "then , using bloch s theorem , we derive analytical expressions for the band of high-@xmath0 propagating solutions that can originate from this elementary excitation by hybridization in the periodic structure . using these analytical expressions",
    ", we show that srspps in thin metal layers can  and commonly do  give rise to hmm - like properties in subwavelength metal - dielectric multilayers ; on the other hand , lrspps only form a very narrow plasmonic band near the light line of the dielectric and do not produce a high-@xmath0 band . furthermore",
    ", we apply the formalism to graphene - dielectric metamaterials in the thz range .",
    "we show that tm - polarized plasmons in individual graphene sheets also hybridize to form vpps with hmm - like properties in the frequency range where the imaginary part of the graphene conductivity significantly exceeds its real part . on the other hand , _ transverse _ or te - polarized graphene plasmons @xcite behave like lrspps in metal - dielectric multilayers , not giving rise to hmm - like behavior .",
    "the present results are primarily valuable from the theoretical point of view , providing a general understanding of how high-@xmath0 band of bulk propagating waves originate from fixed-@xmath0 surface excitations in individual layers of a multilayer system .",
    "in addition , our results have practical applications , allowing for very efficient estimation of vpp dispersion and hmm properties in existing hmms ( metal - dielectric and graphene - dielectric multilayers ) , which is useful in the design of hmm - based devices such as hyperlenses with improved performance .",
    "moreover , the present results provide a means to determine whether any localized excitation ( electromagnetic or otherwise ) is likely to give rise to hmm - like or bulk plasmon - like behavior when assembled into a periodic system .",
    "examples may include optical waveguide arrays , multilayers supporting bloch surface waves or spoof surface plasmons , periodic layers of two - dimensional electron gas ( e.g. multiple quantum - well semiconductor heterostructures ) or even acoustic multilayers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . *",
    "* section [ sec : review ] briefly reviews the basic theoretical background on multilayer hmms , including the dispersion relation for the vpps and its representation using the pole expansion formalism @xcite . in section [ sec : central ] we analyze this representation and derive the existence conditions for broad vpp band formation from arbitrary resonant elementary excitation in the metamaterial s unit cell . in section [ sec : applications ] we apply our findings to several cases of pole expansion , including multilayers made of metal and graphene ; specifically , we show that short - range spps do give rise to hmm behavior while long - range spps do not .",
    "we also analyse the applicability of graphene for high-@xmath0 hmms .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the results .",
    "we begin by recalling that in an infinite , periodic metal - dielectric structure ( fig .",
    "1b ) where losses are neglected , and so metal layers with permittivity @xmath14 and thickness @xmath15 alternate with dielectric layers with permittivity @xmath16 and thickness @xmath17 , the dispersion relation of propagating waves can be obtained via bloch s theorem using the standard transfer matrix approach @xcite . from the transfer matrix for one period of the structure,@xmath18\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } e^{iw_{d}d_{d } } & 0\\\\ 0 & e^{-iw_{d}d_{d}}\\end{array}\\right],\\label{eq : transmat}\\ ] ] where the reflection and transmission coefficients of a metal layer @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by the airy formulas,@xmath21 the interface reflection and transmission coefficients given by the fresnel formulas,@xmath22 and @xmath23 expressing the relation between the tangential ( @xmath24 ) and the normal ( @xmath25 ) component of the wave vector in each layer ( we choose the square root of complex @xmath26 so that @xmath27 ; if @xmath28 we take @xmath29 ) , bloch s theorem yields @xcite@xmath30=\\cos(w_{m}d_{m})\\cos(w_{d}d_{d})\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{m}w_{d}}{\\epsilon_{d}w_{m}}+\\frac{\\epsilon_{d}w_{m}}{\\epsilon_{m}w_{d}}\\right)\\sin(w_{m}d_{m})\\sin(w_{d}d_{d}).\\end{gathered } \\label{eq : bloch}\\ ] ]    this expression describes a propagating bloch wave with tangential component @xmath24 and normal component @xmath31 . to relate it to the hyperbolic dispersion relation , one can taylor expand it around the points where @xmath32=1 $ ] .",
    "provided the layers are thin enough ( @xmath33 ) so that @xmath34 , eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath35 @xcite , similar to eq .   where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 which results in @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a broad range of parameters .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]c , the bloch waves in hmms approach a hyperbolic dispersion relation for smaller @xmath24 but deviate from it as @xmath24 increases .",
    "the upper limit @xmath39 @xcite is a cut - off imposed by the finite thickness of constituent layers , fundamentally limiting the applicability of the effective medium approximation .",
    "this cut - off , essentially resulting from violation of the subwavelength condition for waves with very large @xmath24 , is the primary limiting factor for the overall pdos increase in multilayer hmms .",
    "another limitation is related to the presence of losses @xcite , which would also eventually render the bloch waves fully evanescent . yet",
    "anther , more fundamental limitation is associated with the non - local effects in the response of the electron gas in metal @xcite .    finally , to relate the bloch waves given by eq .   to vpps",
    ", one can replace the metal layers with a hypothetical structure whose reflection and transmission coefficients only contain one resonant guided - wave excitation , i.e. , are of the form of a simple pole @xcite@xmath40 where the location of the pole @xmath41 and the pole strength @xmath42 depend on the exact nature of the excitation .",
    "practically , for the case of metal - dielectric multilayers one can determine @xmath42 and @xmath41 by comparing the generalized form of reflection and transmission coefficients eq .   to the airy formulas . the second term in the expansion for @xmath19 is to ensure that @xmath43 for @xmath44 , as normally incident light should be incapable of exciting any guided wave in a planar layer due to momentum conservation .",

[ fig : schematic]c ) , correctly describing high-@xmath0 waves in such a multilayer .",
    "hence , it can be concluded that these waves originate from hybridization of srspps in the metal layers , and are indeed vpps .",
    "we note that these vpps exist in a very wide range of @xmath24 while the original spps only exist at a single @xmath46 .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that vpp formation is specific to srspps ; other pole - like excitations present in a thin metal layer , such as the lrspp , was not found to affect the vpp band in any significant way .",
    "another interesting observation was that vpps were found to exist _ outside _ of the hmm range @xcite , where earlier works indeed predicted two branches of propagating waves , one with positive and one with negative refraction @xcite .",
    "however , the range of the vpp band in this regime was found to be significantly narrower in @xmath24 , and eq .",
    "was no longer applicable .",
    "all these facts taken together mean that it is necessary to understand whether and when a pole - like excitation of the type of eq",
    ".   leads to the formation of a vpp band which would be sufficiently broadband to lead to an hmm response .",
    "this understanding , in the form of generalized existence conditions for the vpp band , is especially important for predicting whether an hmm regime is possible with new types of plasmonic multilayer structures , such as those based on graphene , and what prevents other kinds of structures , such as high - index dielectric waveguide arrays , from giving rise to hmm properties .",
    "we begin our investigation by using eq .",
    "and rederiving the dispersion relation in the general form , @xmath47=\\frac{\\kappa-\\kappa_{p}}{2\\tau}e^{\\frac{2\\pi d}{\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\kappa^{2}-\\epsilon_{d}}}\\\\ -\\left[\\frac{\\tau}{\\kappa_{p}}+\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\kappa_{p}}\\right)^{2}\\frac{\\kappa-\\kappa_{p}}{2\\tau}\\right]e^{-\\frac{2\\pi d}{\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\kappa^{2}-\\epsilon_{d}}}\\equiv f(\\kappa),\\end{gathered } \\label{eq : newdisp}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath24 and @xmath41 are now dimensionless ( normalized by @xmath48 ) .",

    "this explains that the vpp band should widen as the structure becomes more subwavelength ( smaller @xmath51 ) , but does not explain how it can fill a very broad range of @xmath24 since that would require violating the assumptions leading to eq .  .",

    "[ fig : central]a .",
    "we see that the vpp band follows the line @xmath68 until @xmath83 , after which it slants to follow the line @xmath84 .",
    "the vpp bands corresponding to the two asymptotes overlap near the intersection point ( @xmath68 , @xmath85 ) , where the equation ceases to be analytically solvable and the vpp band has a more complicated shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : central]b  d ) .",
    "it was also established that non - zero @xmath86 influences this behavior only weakly , suppressing any solutions of eq .",
    "below the light line ( @xmath87 ) and slightly modifying the limiting behavior near it .",
    "we can thus identify two distinct characteristic cases when the vpp band is sufficiently broad .",
    "first , it can be seen that for the both limiting cases , the band widens as @xmath55 approaches unity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : central ] ) .",
    "hence the region @xmath88 corresponds to the case when bulk propagating solutions are supported for the widest range of @xmath24 .",
    "second , for the special case @xmath89 , when the line corresponding to eq .",
    "is nearly horizontal , there is a narrow range of @xmath90 $ ] when the vpp band width spans from below unity all the way to @xmath91 , approaching very large values for @xmath92 for very deeply subwavelength structures .",
    "the most straightforward way to test the proposed criteria is to apply the conditions to the well - studied hmm produced from metal - dielectric multilayers , using spps in the metal layers as the elementary excitations in eq .  .",
    "it is known that a metal layer supports two types of such plasmons depending on whether the individual plasmons at the layer interfaces are coupled symmetrically or antisymmetrically with respect to the dominant field component @xmath93 .",
    "both these modes can be obtained from the equation @xmath94    the primary difference between them is the behavior of their propagation constant @xmath41 as the metallic layer thickness @xmath15 approaches zero .",
    "the symmetrically coupled spp has its wave vector approach the light cone ( @xmath95 ) , and if the metal is lossy , the losses decrease as the wave becomes increasingly less confined to the layer .",
    "the asymmetrically coupled spp has its wave vector approach infinity ( @xmath96 ) , and the wave becomes increasingly more confined to the metal layer , so the losses increase . for the latter reason ,",
    "these two spps are traditionally denoted long - range and short - range , or lrspp and srspp , respectively .",
    "it has already been proved @xcite that srspps can and do give rise to the vpp band in metal - dielectric hmms , and we begin by reproducing this result with the proposed criteria . in the appropriate limit of sufficiently thin metal layer , the expressions for the pole expansion parameters for eq .",
    "can be obtained from eq .   as , in dimensionless",
    "units,@xmath97 we note at once that @xmath55 does not depend on @xmath15 , making the analysis particularly easy:@xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "we can see that @xmath100 unless @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : metal]a ) .",
    "so , it can be concluded that broadband vpps are commonly formed by hybridization of srspps , as confirmed by the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : metal]b .",
    "the only exception is when @xmath102 leading to @xmath103 , so the vpp band becomes increasingly more narrow - band and moves towards larger @xmath24 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : central]a ) .",
    "note that this corresponds to an epsilon - near - zero ( enz ) regime rather than an hmm regime according to eqs .  ,",
    "and the narrowing and shifting of the vpp band near the enz points is consistent with our earlier observation @xcite .",
    "the vpp band shift remains small since the slope parameter , @xmath104 , becomes very large in the enz case .     on the permittivities of metal and dielectric in a thin metal layer ( @xmath105  nm ) for srspps and lrspps .",

    "the resulting expressions are @xmath108 which gives @xmath109 and it can be seen that @xmath110 as @xmath111 and the structure becomes increasingly more subwavelength .",

    "[ fig : metal]b ) and the dispersion of vpps in the bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : metal]c ) for lrspp vs.  srspp cases .",
    "this result can also be explained by noting that an lrspp in a metallic layer bears more and more resemblance to a plane wave in the surrounding medium as the layer becomes thinner , which is accompanied by progressively poorer coupling between the wave and the metal ; it is this poor coupling that manifests itself in @xmath110 .",
    "the same poor coupling will thus be characteristic for vpps resulting from lrspps , which will therefore be very similar in properties to plane waves propagating in the dielectric of the hmm and thus occupy but a very narrow range of @xmath24 .    on the other hand , for @xmath55 to be on the order of unity in the lrspp case , the quantity @xmath113 needs to be between 0.25 and 1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : metal]d ) , i.e. , the multilayer should not be very subwavelength . in this regime , it can be expected that both lrspps and srspps may contribute to the vpp band , in line with the recent observation that real multilayer structures can outperform ideal hmms for some values of layer thicknesses @xcite .",

    ".    however , in graphene there can be conditions when the real part of the conductivity is quite significant [ see fig.[fig : grapheneconductivity](a ) ] .",
    "in such cases , the presented results can only be used as a guideline , and the precise characteristics of vpps should be established by additional calculations .    to define the parameter range where the present analysis is applicable",
    ", we introduce the figure - of - merit @xmath156 , which is an adaptation of the quantity commonly used to characterize the amount of losses in metamaterials to a single graphene sheet .",
    "we will assume that losses in graphene are small if @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ fig : grapheneconductivity](c ) presents the figure - of - merit for the damping value @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "as we see , @xmath123 corresponds to the fermi level _",
    "@xmath158 _ and frequencies above 20 thz , whereas in the lower thz and microwave range graphene is essentially just a dissipative layer ( resistor ) .",
    "we should keep in mind that at photon energies larger than 0.2 ev , which corresponds to the frequencies above 50 thz , the interaction with the lattice phonons of the dielectric spacer layers in multilayered graphene introduce additional large losses not taken into account in eq . .",
    "therefore the region from 20 to 50 thz is probably the best for the realization of graphene based hmms , and larger @xmath116 are favorable for better hmm performance .",
    "another parameter , namely , damping ( or collision frequency ) @xmath121 depends very much on the quality of graphene ( its growth process and handling when transferring to the substrate ) .",
    "the values reported in the literature vary from @xmath159 to @xmath160 ( the reader is referred to the recent review of graphene for thz applications@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : grapheneconductivity](d ) the influence of damping on the figure - of - merit is demonstrated .",
    "whereas for the above mentioned @xmath120 graphene could be only used for hmm starting from 20 thz , reducing the damping by 10 times ( @xmath161 ) makes graphene hmms feasible starting from as low as 1.6 thz .",
    "on the other hand , doubling the damping to @xmath162 makes graphene useless for building hmms in the entire thz - ir range .",
    "however , there are definite grounds for optimism in the constant progress in graphene fabrication technology . for example , chemical vapor deposition growth of centimeter - large monocrystalline graphene with the quality rivaling that of exfoliated graphene @xcite and large mobility of carriers in graphene surrounded by two - dimensional boron nitride @xcite have been reported recently .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the general theoretical conditions for an arbitrary elementary excitation existing in the unit cell of a multilayer periodic system to hybridize into a broadband bulk high-@xmath0 propagating waves ( such as vpps in hmms ) . by isolating the unit - cell elementary excitation in the form of a generalized resonance defined by a pole - like response in its fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients [ eq .  [ eq : pole ] ] , and by using bloch s theorem to couple the unit cells via dielectric spacer layers",
    ", we have derived analytic relations connecting the width of the resulting band of propagating waves in the @xmath0-space with the properties of the elementary excitations , such as the pole location and strength , as well as parameters of the dielectric spacer layers .    using these analytical expressions ,",
    "we have confirmed that one kind of surface plasmons existing in thin metal layers , namely the srspps , can and normally do give rise to a broad band of volume plasmon polaritons , resulting in hmm - like properties of subwavelength metal - dielectric multilayers @xcite .",
    "conversely , the other kind of spps in such layers , namely the lrspps , only form a very narrow plasmonic band near the light line of the dielectric and do not produce a broad high-@xmath0 band .",
    "we have also applied the formalism to multilayered graphene - dielectric metamaterials in the thz range and shown that tm - polarized plasmons in individual graphene sheets do hybridize to form vpps with hmm - like properties , and the vpp band is broadband enough for realistic values of graphene conductivity [ for the considered geometry @xmath163 . on the other hand , transverse ( te - polarized ) graphene plasmons only form a very narrow vpp band , not giving rise to hmm properties and behaving like lrspps in this respect .",
    "we have also shown that graphene can be a good building material for high-@xmath0 band thz and ir metamaterials , if it has sufficiently high quality ( the damping @xmath121 smaller than @xmath164 ) .    along with providing the general theoretical understanding of the formation of a high-@xmath0 band of bulk propagating waves from fixed-@xmath0 surface excitations in individual layers of a multilayer system ,",
    "our results have promising practical applications .",
    "they are twofold .",
    "first , the analytic expressions allow for very easy and computationally efficient estimations of vpp dispersion in existing metal - dielectric and graphene multilayer hmms , which can be used to design hmms with optimized performance .",
    "second , on a more abstract level , the formalism provides insight into a general question whether broadband large - wavevector higher - dimensional response should be expected from _ any _ given type of lower - dimensional elementary excitations in _ arbitrary _ periodic systems , not necessarily bi - layer unit cells , but also many - layer and gradient .",
    "examples may include new types of photonic structures such as waveguide arrays and multilayers based on bloch surface waves or spoof surface plasmons .",
    "moreover , by virtue of mathematical similarities between electromagnetic waves and other wave phenomena in physics ( such as acoustic waves in elastic multilayers and steady - state solutions of the schrdinger equation in multiple quantum - well heterostructures ) , it can be speculated that the present results may be applied to these alternative systems , extending the metamaterial approach beyond electromagnetism .",
