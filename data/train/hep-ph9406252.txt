    "the deep structure of the photon has been expected to be calculable perturbatively in qcd @xcite , except at small @xmath0 @xcite . in practice , however , non - perturbative effects are found to be significant @xcite at present experiments , where the electromagnetic structure of weizscker  williams quasi - real photon @xcite has been measured up to the momentum transfer scale @xmath1 = 100 gev@xmath2 in @xmath3 collision experiments .",
    "several parametrizations of the scale - dependent effective parton distributions in the photon have been proposed ; some are based on plausible dynamical assumptions @xcite and the others @xcite have been obtained by fitting phenomenologically to the photon structure function data @xcite .",
    "these parametrizations typically have similar quark distributions which are directly constrained by the structure function data .",
    "on the other hand , wildly different gluon distributions have been proposed since the electromagnetic structure of the photon is rather insensitive to its gluon content .",
    "recently tristan experiments @xcite have shown evidence for the effective gluon content of the photon in two - photon production of high transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) jets .",
    "the observed jet production can not be understood without the contribution from gluons in the colliding photons , whereas it does not allow a very hard gluon distribution @xcite that is consistent with the structure function data .",
    "more recently , the tristan experiments have reported evidence for copious production of charmed particles in the two - photon collision process , in their various decay modes and at various @xmath4 range @xcite .",
    "the charm production rate has been found to be particularly sensitive to the gluon distribution in the photon @xcite and that the present data tend to prefer those parametrizations with large gluon content at small @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the recent data on the jet and charm production in the two - photon process thus give us evidence and some quantitative information of the gluon content of the photon , but they are not yet accurate enough to determine directly the effective gluon distribution .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a set of effective parton distributions in the photon with systematically different gluon distributions , so that we can learn more about the photon structure from these experiments .    in this paper",

    "we use @xmath48 = 4 gev@xmath2 throughout our analysis in order that our perturbation approximation works well .    as an initial valence - quark distribution , we take the following functional form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the free parameters which will be fitted to the experimental data , and @xmath53 is the beta function that ensures the normalization , @xmath54 for the energy fraction @xmath55 of the valence - quarks in the photon .    as for the initial gluon distribution ,",

    "the normalization factor is chosen such that @xmath59 the present structure function data are not accurate enough to determine the gluon parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "we obtain constraints on the ratio of the gluon energy fraction ( @xmath57 ) to the valence - quark energy fraction ( @xmath50 ) as follows @xcite . at sufficiently low momentum transfer scale ( @xmath60 0.5 gev@xmath2 ) , only the long wavelength components of the photon are probed and the quark - antiquark pair produced from the photon undergoes non - perturbative soft qcd dynamics that resembles the one which makes the quark - antiquark pair form the low - lying vector boson . the photon structure",
    "is then expected to have components similar to those of the vector bosons , in particular the @xmath61 meson that couples strongly to the photon .",
    "although we do not know the structure of @xmath61 , we expect the soft qcd dynamics to be insensitive to the total spin of the system and that it may be similar to the observed @xmath62 structure @xcite .",
    "if the photon had only this soft component , its deep structure should also be similar and we expect @xmath63 in fact this ratio is common in the nucleon structure as well @xcite and we can regard this ratio as an universal one from soft qcd dynamics .",

    ", one is more and more sensitive to these short wave - length components which dominate the photon structure at asymptotically high @xmath1 .",
    "although the transition from the regime where the vector meson - like component dominates to the regime where the short wave - length component dominates is gradual and it is governed by the non - perturbative dynamics , we may infer the effect of the latter component from its asymptotic behavior that can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "in particular , for the ratio of the gluon to the valence - quark energy fraction , we expect @xmath65 for three light quark flavors ( @xmath12 = 3 ) . at the momentum transfer scale @xmath48 = 4 gev@xmath2 ,",
    "it is hence natural to expect the ratio to lie somewhere between the two extremes eq.([constv ] ) and ( [ consta ] ) : @xmath66 we shall see in the next section that the valence - quark fraction @xmath50 is determined to be about unity by the experimental data of @xmath11 .",
    "we will hence examine the parameter range @xmath67 for the gluon energy fraction .",
    "finally , we note that the sea - quark distribution is intimately related to the gluon distribution and that one can not choose them independently .",
    "although the sea - quark distribution is in principle observable from the small @xmath0 behavior of the photon structure function , we find that the present experimental determination of the small @xmath0 structure of the photon suffers from an uncertainty associated with the unfolding technique adopted by most experiments @xcite : this will be discussed in sec .",

    "in particular , we find for the energy fraction ratio that @xmath80 holds almost independently of the input gluon parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the region which we will discuss .",
    "the ratio increases with decreasing light - quark mass , and reaches 0.2 at @xmath81 0.3 gev .",
    "the ratio is about 0.3 in the parametrization of the @xmath62 structure @xcite , and its perturbative asymptotic value is calculated to be 0.16 for @xmath12 = 3 .",

    "the charm quark can not be incorporated into the massless ap equations in the region of moderate @xmath1 , say @xmath82 100 gev@xmath2 , which has so far been probed by experiments .",
