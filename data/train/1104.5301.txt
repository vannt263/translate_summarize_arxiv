    "the ability of optical dipole traps to simultaneously cool and trap ground - state atoms in different magnetic sublevels paved the way for the experimental realization of spinor bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite where the liberation of spin degrees of freedom has added new and exciting possibilities in the study of bec @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance to the present work has been the extensive study of spin dynamics both in theory @xcite and in experiments @xcite , which aims to understand how condensate populations exchange coherently among different internal spin states as well as to explore the potential of these spin oscillations as probes to the intriguing physics underlying spin - dependent collisions .",
    "so far , such studies have been carried out mainly in spinor condensates with sufficiently large numbers of atoms where the measurement based on the standard absorption - imaging technique has established that the spin dynamics agrees well with the result predicted @xcite within the framework of mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the use of the spinor condensates with relatively large atom numbers , unfortunately , renders it virtually impossible to observe beyond - mean - field quantum effects , which , besides being fascinating by their own rights , are thought to be responsible for exotic physics in highly correlated systems . in small spinor becs ,",
    "quantum fluctuations of atoms are expected to play a more prominent role .",
    "hence , their spin dynamics should be governed by spin - mixing of quantum mechanical nature , which is responsible , for example , for the generation of squeezed collective spin states and entangled states @xcite",
    ". however , the absorption - imaging technique , which works well with large condensates , is no longer an effective detection tool for condensates with small numbers of atoms as a result of the much reduced signals .",
    "recently , owing to the experimental realization of strong coupling between ultracold atomic gases and cavity @xcite , spinor bec confined in a single - mode cavity has received much theoretical attention @xcite . in particular ,",
    "cavity transmission spectra have been suggested as candidates for probing the quantum ground state @xcite or the quantum spin dynamics @xcite of a spinor bec .    in all these proposals ,",
    "one aims to learn the condensate dynamics from the photons landing on the photoelectric detector .",
    "the detection is a process , according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , that projects the system ( condensate + photon ) to one of the states that are eigenstates of the observable being measured .",
    "this causes the condensate dynamics to be disrupted in a random fashion and is the underlying physical mechanism behind the measurement back - action .",
    "motivated by the possibility that such a back - action may be significant for a small condensate , we investigate , in the present work , the effect of the back - action on the quantum spin - mixing dynamics of a small spinor bec subject to a homodyne detection as shown in fig .  [ scheme ] ( see next section for a detailed description ) .",
    "we take the stochastic master equation approach which emulates the experimental process where many runs of continuous measurements must be performed before one can arrive at the quantum mechanical average of a dynamical observable .",
    "we show that the effect of back - action is sensitive to whether the condensate is in the ferromagnetic or in the antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "we point out , in connection with the recent interest in the dynamics of small spinor condensates , that there is a limitation to this cavity - based detection scheme : for sufficiently small condensates , the number of experimental runs required to faithfully extract the internal spin dynamics can be unrealistically large ; we estimate the atom numbers above which this cavity - based homodyne detection scheme is experimentally feasible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present a measurement model and derive the stochastic master equation ( sme ) describing the evolution of the spinor bec . in sec .",
    "iii , we first analyze the measurement back - action in two - atom case where some typical effects , such as the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) and quantum diffusion @xcite , are clearly shown , and then extend the analyses to @xmath1-atom cases by numerical simulation with realistic experimental parameters .",
    "we show different responses of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground state to measurements , and measurement - induced decoherence effects in quantum spin - mixing dynamics . in sec .",
    "iv , the measurement outcomes are given by averaging over the photodetector currents of repeated measurements .",

    "figure [ scheme ] is a schematic of our model made up of three parts : a @xmath0 spinor bec , a driven ring cavity , and a homodyne detection arrangement .",
    "the bec is assumed to be sufficiently small ( with less than 1000 weakly interacting atoms ) so that  its three spin components , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 , share the same spatial mode . in this so - called single - mode approximation ( sma )",

    "@xmath9 is a coefficient related to the spin - dependent part of the two - body interaction , and finally @xmath10 the quadratic zeeman shift .",
    "the cavity is assumed to support a @xmath11-polarized single traveling mode with frequency @xmath12 , and is driven by an external probe field with an amplitude @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , both @xmath12 and @xmath14 are assumed to be sufficiently red - detuned from the @xmath15 atomic transition frequency @xmath16 so that the excited states can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "under such a circumstance , our cavity  + condensate system ( excluding the reservoir consisting of the cavity vacuum modes ) is described by a total hamiltonian @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is given explicitly by @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the field operator for annihilating a cavity photon and @xmath21 the detuning  of the probe relative to the cavity mode frequency .",
    "in addition to the cavity photon energy ( the first term ) and the hamiltonian simulating the process of pumping the cavity mode by the classical external probe field ( the second term ) , a new term ( the last term ) appears in eq .",
    "( [ h_m ] ) , which characterizes the atom - photon interaction with an effective strength @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the atom - cavity mode coupling coefficient .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , the selection rule for dipole transitions involving @xmath11-polarized photons only permits the transitions between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and consequently , the last term , in the limit of far - off - resonant atom - photon interaction , is expected to be proportional to @xmath26 , which is equivalent to @xmath27 when the definition for the total atom number , @xmath28 , is taken into consideration .",
    "second , one can express@xmath29 and @xmath30 in terms of @xmath31 along with two constants of motion under the total hamiltonian @xmath32 : @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 ( magnetization ) , and as a result , we will focus , from now on , our attention on the dynamics of @xmath36 .  finally , we emphasize that the dispersive interaction term @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ h_m ] ) can cause the probe field to experience a phase shift proportional to @xmath38 , which , in the language of measurement in quantum optics , constitutes the ( matter wave ) signal we aim to determine from the measurement of the probe field .",
    "these discussions lend itself naturally to the final component of our model . to begin with , we note that @xmath31 does not commute with @xmath32 and can not serve as a quantum nondemolition measurement ( qnd ) variable @xcite , and thus , the probe field is to remain as weak as the measurement permits in order to minimize its back - action on the signal . as the photons leaking from the cavity are combined with those from a strong local oscillator prior to the measurement by the photodetector , the homodyne detection scheme illustrated in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] can greatly enhance the signal to noise ratio while at the same time allows us to directly measure the quadrature phase amplitude and hence the @xmath36-dependent probe phase shift as discussed above . in practice , in order to gain the spin dynamics , one must monitor the phase shift continually , and perform many runs of experiments , each of which provides a continual stream of information about @xmath36 , before one can average over all the runs to construct the ensemble average @xmath39 .",
    "the stochastic master equation approach , which combines the system - reservoir theory with the photon counting theory @xcite , is believed to be an excellent tool to simulate such experimental processes .",
    "this is the approach we take in the present study .",

    "still do not allow us to extract the signal .",
    "( black ) , @xmath162 ( blue ) , and @xmath161 ( red ) photodetector currents .",
    "the total atom number @xmath1 is @xmath163 in ( a ) and @xmath158 in ( b ) , and other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] .",
    "the insets show the deterministic evolution of @xmath36.,width=307 ]    it appears that one could increase the measurement strength @xmath117 instead of the number of runs to enhance the signal to noise ratio according to eq .",
    "( [ current3 ] ) .",
    "however , in quantum measurements , the system dynamics is conditioned on the detection outcomes ; increasing the measurement strength also enhances the quantum measurement back - action .",
    "first , according to the discussion in sec .",
    "ii , strong measurement renders a large decoherence to the measured quantum state so that the spin oscillations is rapidly damped .",
    "second , an increase in @xmath117 will increase the white noise in the stochastic schrdinger equation , which in turn demands more runs to recover the deterministic dynamics .",
    "thus , there is a limitation to what we can do to improve the signal to noise ratio by increasing the measurement strength .",
    "an alternative is to increase the atom number .",
    "not only does it enhance the signal part of the current in eq .",
    "( [ current3 ] ) , but also it reduces the quantum fluctuation of @xmath31 and thus the related measurement back - action .",
    "the net effect is the reduction in the number of required runs .",
    "but , as the atom number increases , the mean - field dynamics will gradually dominate @xcite , defeating the goal of extracting beyond - mean - field quantum dynamics from this measurement scheme . a possible way to increase the signal to noise ratio without raising",
    "the atom number is to process the current signal using  methods such as filtering high frequency components and averaging over sliding windows @xcite .",
    "however , our study shows that more than @xmath162 runs are still needed before we can reveal the spin dynamics for a small bec with less than @xmath158 atoms .",
    "in this work , we have considered a homodyne detection scheme , which is designed to make a continuous measurement of the quantum spin - mixing dynamics of a small @xmath164=1 spinor bec inside an optical cavity . using the stochastic master equation approach ,",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the quantum measurement back - action on the spin population dynamics in the bad cavity limit .",
    "we have used a simple two - atom system to illustrate both the measurement - induced quantum zeno effect and the measurement - induced diffusive quantum dynamics .",
    "we have applied the physical intuitions gained from the two - atom model to understand the measurement back - action on the spin population dynamics in a spin-1 bec .",
    "we have shown that the effect of back - action is sensitive to the quantum fluctuation of the spinor condensate .",
    "finally , we stress that this study is motivated by recent proposals for using measurement techniques popular in cavity quantum optics to probe the quantum dynamics of small condensates .",
    "an important point we aim to make in this work is that when applying optical detection techniques to small condensates , one needs to pay close attention to quantum fluctuations , which are typically ignored for large condensates .",
    "indeed , we have shown that due to the quantum measurement back - action , the number of runs of measurements , needed to recover the deterministic population dynamics from the ensemble average of the photoelectric current , increases as the number of atoms in the condensate decreases , suggesting that the scheme is not practical for sufficiently small condensates where the number of runs can become unrealistically large .",
