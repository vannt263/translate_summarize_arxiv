    "we consider a system of free fermions hopping between neighbouring sites of an infinite linear chain .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads + = - _ n t_n ( c_n^ c_n+1 + c_n+1^ c_n ) + _ n _",
    "n c_n^c_n [ eqn : hop ] where @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element and the hat denotes quantities of the total system . in the following , we set @xmath10 and @xmath11 except at the boundaries of the subsystem which consists of the sites @xmath12",
    ". we will mainly consider the case of one bond defect at the left boundary , @xmath13 , but we will also give results for two equal bond defects at the two boundaries , @xmath14 , and one or two site defects next to the boundary , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "+ the total system is assumed to be half filled and in its ground state @xmath17 .",
    "the reduced density matrix then has the form @xcite = k [ eqn : rho1 ] where @xmath18 is a normalization constant and the matrix @xmath19 follows from the one - particle correlation function of the total system _ mn = < 0| c_m^ c_n    the @xmath20 submatrix of @xmath21 with the sites restricted to the subsystem . for a homogeneous infinite system ,",
    "@xmath22 is given by c_ij = c^0(i - j ) = [ eqn : cf1 ] with defects , the translational invariance is lost and for single defects @xmath22 has the general form c_ij = c^0(i - j ) - c^1(i+j ) [ eqn : cf2 ] thus @xmath23 is the difference of a toeplitz matrix depending on @xmath24 and a hankel matrix depending on @xmath25 .",
    "physically , the term @xmath26 leads to oscillatory behaviour of the correlations as one moves along the chain . for site defects ,",
    "these are the ruderman- kittel oscillations if one looks at the density @xmath27 . for bond defects ,",
    "the density is unaffected but the oscillations appear e.g. in the nearest - neighbour ( bond ) correlation function @xmath28 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 can be obtained by using the scattering phase shifts and including the contribution of possible localized states caused by the defect .",
    "thus a single weak bond @xmath29 in an infinite total system leads to c^1(l ) = - ( e^- i_l - e^ i_l-2 ) [ eqn : cf3 ] where i_l = _ 0^/2 [ eqn : int ] for @xmath30 , this simplifies to @xmath31 and @xmath22 assumes the known form for a system with an open end . for a strong bond , @xmath32 ,",
    "one has to add the contribution c^1(l ) = - [ eqn : boundstate ] from the occupied bound state at energy @xmath33 below the band .",
    "similarly , a site defect @xmath34 leads to c^1(l ) = ( i_l-1 - i_l-3 + 2 i_l-2 ) [ eqn : cf4 ] by diagonalizing @xmath22 one obtains its eigenvalues @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , from which the eigenvalues @xmath37 of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) follow .",
    "the reduced density matrix then takes the diagonal form = k [ eqn : rho2 ] the entanglement entropy is defined by @xmath6 ( we are using the natural logarithm , not the one to basis 2 ) and reads in terms of the @xmath35 s = -_k [ eqn : entro2a ] and in terms of the @xmath40 s= _ k [ eqn : entro2b ]    only the @xmath35 which are not too close to 0 or 1 resp . the @xmath40 which are not much larger than 1 in magnitude",
    "give a sizeable contribution to the entropy .",
    "we have calculated the correlation matrix @xmath22 for the case of single defects by evaluating the integrals for @xmath26 numerically . from this",
    "the low - lying single - particle eigenvalues @xmath40 with @xmath41 were obtained .",
    "higher values can not be reached with standard double precision routines because the corresponding @xmath35 lie too close to 0 or 1 . however , as noted above , they are unimportant for @xmath0 . in the following",
    "we always consider even @xmath1 .",
    "+ spectra for one bond defect are shown in fig . 1 for a subsystem of @xmath42 sites .",
    "the eigenvalues come in pairs ( @xmath43 ) due to the particle - hole symmetry of the problem . for a homogeneous system , @xmath44",
    ", one finds the slightly bent curve known from previous investigations @xcite .",
    "+ for a weak defect , one can see a shift of the dispersion curve which is upward for positive @xmath40 and downward for negative ones . this shift becomes stronger as the bond becomes weaker .",
    "in addition , oscillations appear which also increase for weaker bonds .",
    "most importantly , however , more and more of the low @xmath40 follow a steeper dispersion curve as @xmath45 approaches zero .",
    "this curve has a slope approximately twice as large as for the homogeneous system and no wiggles and represents the result one obtains directly for the system with a free end .",
    "thus the spectrum with the defect is a mixture of those for the two cases @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "+ for a strong defect , the situation is basically the same .",
    "however , here the two lowest eigenvalues @xmath47 and @xmath48 play a special role because they approach zero as @xmath49 .",
    "this moves the left and right part of the spectra two units apart .",
    "this feature can be understood from the correlations in this limit .",
    "the two    localized states below and above the band then exhaust the local hilbert space at the two bond sites and effectively cut the system .",
    "thus @xmath50 for @xmath51 and the diagonal term @xmath52 gives one eigenvalue zero .",
    "the other one appears because the remaining part of the subsystem has an odd number ( @xmath53 ) of sites .",
    "it is absent , if the full subsystem has @xmath54 sites .",
    "then the spectrum for @xmath55 is exactly the same as for @xmath1 sites and @xmath56 up to the remaining zero eigenvalue .",
    "spectra for two bond defects are shown in fig .",
    "these were calculated by finding the eigenfunctions of @xmath57 for a total system of size @xmath58 numerically .",
    "this introduces small finite - size effects but these are not visible on the scale of the figure .",
    "there is a shift of the curves as for a single defect , but now it affects @xmath59 eigenvalues if the defects are weak .",
    "thus a gap is opened in the spectrum . for @xmath60 all @xmath40 diverge .",
    "this is reflects the fact that the subsystem is , in this limit , completely decoupled from the rest and the ground state @xmath17 becomes a product state .",
    "then @xmath5 has one eigenvalue 1 if all single - particle levels are unoccupied and all other eigenvalues vanish .",
    "if the defects are strong , two @xmath40 go to zero while the remaining eigenvalues again diverge .",
    "the zero eigenvalues are related to the localized states at the two bonds which belong to the subsystem as well as to the environment . the ground state @xmath17 then has four components which differ by the location of the electrons on the two bonds and the four resulting eigenvalues 1/4 of @xmath5 are produced by the two vanishing @xmath40 .",
    "+ for comparison , the spectra for two site defects are shown in fig .",
    "2 . these defects destroy the particle - hole symmetry of the problem and therefore the spectrum of the @xmath40 is in general no longer symmetric with respect to zero .",
    "apart from that , it shows the same features as for two bond defects .",
    "in particular , also the site defects cut off the subsystem if the site energy @xmath61 becomes large and thus all @xmath40 except two diverge for @xmath62 . in this limit , the reflection symmetry of the spectrum is also restored .",
    "using the values of the @xmath40 or the @xmath35 , one can obtain the the entanglement entropy from ( [ eqn : entro2a]),([eqn : entro2b ] ) .",
    "results for single bond defects are shown in fig . 4 for system sizes between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the plot on the right hand side shows that @xmath0 varies logarithmically with @xmath1 in all cases .",
    "there is no indication of a @xmath65-term as found in @xcite .",
    "there is only a small variation of the slope with @xmath1 and its asymptotic value can be determined very well by an extrapolation in @xmath66 .",
    "it is remarkable that one can see this logarithmic behaviour so well , since for all sizes considered here only about 20 single - particle eigenvalues contribute if the accuracy is set to @xmath67 .",
    "thus one is far away from a limit in which the eigenvalue spectrum becomes dense and where the logarithmic dependence could result from the density of states .",
    "thus we find that the entanglement entropy has the same form ( [ eqn : entro1 ] ) as for the homogeneous system , but with an effective value @xmath7 which depends on the strength of the defect .",
    "the same holds for two bond defects and also for site defects ( see below ) .",
    "we first discuss the case of one bond defect further .",
    "+ the asymptotic value of @xmath7 , determined by extrapolating the data from @xmath68 , is shown in fig .",
    "5 as a function of the defect strength .",
    "one sees that it varies smoothly between the limits @xmath69 for a subsystem with a free end and @xmath70 for a homogeneous system .",
    "the figure shows @xmath7 only for @xmath71 because one finds that @xmath7 is symmetric under @xmath72 .",
    "one can try to find a simple analytic function which fits the numerical curve in fig .",
    "5 . since the defect is characterized by the scattering phases , one could expect that @xmath7 depends on these .",
    "because one is dealing with an asymptotic property , the phase shifts at the fermi surface should enter .",
    "these are given by    _",
    "= [ eqn : phases ]    for functions symmetric and antisymmetric about the defect , respectively .",
    "one is then lead to the expression    c_eff = + ^2 [ eqn : cfit ]    the expression in the brackets also appears ( as an exponent ) if one calculates the time autocorrelation function of a spin in an xx spin chain with a bond defect @xcite .",
    "the function ( [ eqn : cfit ] ) has the correct limits for @xmath30 and @xmath44 and is symmetric under @xmath72 . as can be seen from the figure , it approximates the numerical data quite well .",
    "the deviations are less than @xmath73 , but the agreement is not perfect . especially for @xmath60 , the data do not seem to vary quadratically in @xmath45 but with a power 1.8 . replacing the power 2 in ( [ eqn : cfit ] ) by this value",
    "improves the fit over the whole intervall substantially .",
    "the deviations become less than @xmath74 and are almost invisible on the scale of the figure . +",
    "the two terms in ( [ eqn : cfit ] ) can be viewed as the contributions of the unperturbed and the perturbed interface , respectively .",
    "one can understand this result from the form of the single - particle spectrum . in the previous section",
    "it was found that it consists of two pieces . if one assumes that in the limit @xmath75 the levels in these two branches become equidistant and dense such that ( for positive @xmath40 ) _",
    "{    c 2ka / l , _ k < + k a / l ,",
    "[ eqn : spec1 ] where @xmath76 depends on @xmath45 such that @xmath77 for @xmath44 and @xmath78 for @xmath30 and @xmath79 is a constant , the entanglement entropy can be written as s = 2 l [ eqn : entro2 ]    here @xmath80 is given by the bracket in ( [ eqn : entro2b ] ) and the factor of 2 in front takes care of the negative levels .",
    "denoting the second integral by @xmath81 , one obtains s = 2 l = l [ eqn : entro3 ] thus each interface brings its own amplitude for the logarithm : the unperturbed one @xmath82 and the perturbed one @xmath81 . for",
    "the homogeneous system the bracket must have the value 1/3 , from which @xmath83 follows .",
    "therefore ( [ eqn : entro3 ] ) gives for @xmath7 c_eff = + 3 g ( ) [ eqn : ceff1 ] if the exact dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath45 were known , one could evaluate the integral @xmath81 and determine @xmath7 in this way .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath40 which are neglected in ( [ eqn : spec1 ] ) could also be included .",
    "+ the discussion so far has dealt with one defect .",
    "however , one can apply it also to the case of two defects .",
    "the results of section iii show that then the lowest eigenvalues are just missing and one also finds that the gap in the spectrum for two defects corresponds roughly to the bending point in the spectrum for one defect .",
    "therefore one has only the second region in ( [ eqn : spec1 ] ) and finds instead of ( [ eqn : entro3 ] ) s = l [ 2 g ( ) ] [ eqn : entro4 ] from which the value of @xmath7 can be read off .",
    "this also gives the relation c^(2)_eff = 2c^(1)_eff - 1 [ eqn : ceff2 ] between the effective c - values for two defects and for one defect .",
    "due to the lower accuracy of the calculations for two defects , this relation could not be checked precisely , but the deviations are less than some percent and vanish near @xmath30 and @xmath44 .",
    "+ results for the case of one site defect are shown in fig .",
    "the entanglement entropy is symmetric under @xmath85 and only positive values of @xmath61 have to be considered .",
    "one sees that @xmath7 decreases again from the value 1 to 1/2 as the perturbation becomes stronger , because the defect cuts the chain in the limit @xmath86 and thus acts like a bond with @xmath30 or @xmath87 .    finally , we present results for the constant @xmath8 in the entropy , see ( [ eqn : entro1 ] ) .",
    "they were obtained by extrapolating @xmath88 from the values @xmath68 .",
    "7 shows , this quantity @xmath8 is not symmetric under @xmath72 for one bond defect .",
    "rather it increases from about 0.5 for @xmath30 to about 1.2 for large values of @xmath45 , with a small initial dip ( which depends sensitively on @xmath7 ) . at @xmath44",
    "we find a value @xmath89 which is in agreement with the findings in @xcite but differs slightly from the value obtained from the asymptotic analysis in @xcite . the limiting value for @xmath90 is found to differ from the value at @xmath30 by @xmath91 .",
    "if one considers systems with an odd number of sites @xmath54 for @xmath55 , this also holds and follows in this case directly from the identity of the single - particle spectra up to one zero eigenvalue ( which contributes @xmath91 ) noted in section iii .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath8 can make the entropy with a defect larger than without one if the subsystem is small enough ( compare fig .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath75 the effect of the reduced @xmath7 always dominates and leads to a reduction of the entanglement .",
    "we have investigated a chain of free electrons in its ground state at half filling .",
    "the entanglement properties were calculated for the case of one or two defects located at the contact points between the subsystem and the rest of the chain .",
    "the density - matrix spectra were seen to differ in a characteristic way from those for a homogeneous system .",
    "nevertheless , the logarithmic dependence of the entanglement entropy on the size persists , only the amplitude changes and becomes dependent on the defect strength .",
    "the mechanism could be described by a simple model based on the features of the single - particle spectra .",
    "a simple approximate formula for the effective central charge was also given .",
    "although we focussed on bond defects , the same features are found for site defects .",
    "the logarithmic law means that the system remains critical , as expected for a localized perturbation . in the two - dimensional system associated with the quantum chain ,",
    "the defect becomes a line as noted and used in @xcite .",
    "such a two - dimensional system with a cut ( because one considers the reduced density matrix ) and one or two straight defect lines perpendicular to this cut can be mapped conformally to a strip @xcite but the defect lines are bent by the mapping . for a single defect , the line runs only in the left or right half of the strip , coming from one point on the boundary and going back to another one . for two defects ,",
    "the two lines are attached to different edges and touch in the center of the strip .",
    "the more complicated density - matrix spectra found here must be related to this feature .",
    "it would be interesting to derive them analytically .",
    "also one wonders if the asymptotic formulae used in @xcite to calculate @xmath0 can be generalized to the present case .",
