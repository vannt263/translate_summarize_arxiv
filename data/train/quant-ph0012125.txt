    "the inversion symmetry point for the probabilities is @xmath123 .",
    "several statements concerning ( [ 2.8 ] ) can be made :    * the result of first order many body perturbation theory in fermionic hilbert space are exactly reproduced for @xmath124 by expanding ( [ 2.8 ] ) to first order in the coupling constant @xmath125 ( i.e. , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) @xcite . * the results of direct numerical diagonalization of the perturbed fermionic hamiltonian agree with the numerical evaluation of ( [ 2.8 ] ) up to @xmath128 and for particle numbers @xmath14 of the order of @xmath129 , the range investigated so far @xcite . * the sum rule + @xmath130 + is exactly obeyed by ( [ 2.8 ] ) : summing the expression in curly brackets in ( [ 2.8 ] ) from @xmath131 to @xmath132 leads to the result @xmath133 .",

    "the occupation probabilities are smoothed out and more spectral weight is found above the fermi energy .",

    "the method rests on the linear dispersion of non  interacting fermion states which is extended to negative energies .",
