    "i.e. _  for lc hybrid functionals with different @xmath28 values , their @xmath35 and @xmath36 are different .",
    "the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath28 is defined by @xmath38 and for small @xmath28 , @xmath39 note that estimate  ( [ eq : sie ] ) is the special case with vanishing @xmath28 of estimate  ( [ lc_sie ] ) .",
    "we apply estimate  ( [ lc_sie ] ) and ( [ b_approx ] ) to the simplest three - electron - bonded system , and the estimated ( which is also a three - electron hemibonded system ) dissociation curves for pure dft and lc hybrid functional are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sie](a ) .",
    "for simplicity , @xmath40 is set to zero and the lda orbital is used for evaluating the coulomb self - interactions ; @xmath28 is set to 0.4 bohr@xmath41 for the lc hybrid functional .",
    "when the exact dissociation curve approaches zero , the sie of the lc hybrid functional is already close to a constant , while the sie of pure dft is still decreasing .",
    "therefore the dissociation curve by the lc hybrid functional does not display a spurious energy barrier as that of the pure dft .",
    "another effect of the long - range correction is the reduction of coulomb self - interaction for the ionic state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sie](a ) , @xmath42 kcal / mol has been modified to @xmath43j^\\text{sr}(\\omega)\\approx-40 $ ] kcal / mol .",
    "the formal feature of spurious energy barrier is one more turning point ( at which the derivative changes sign ) on top of the barrier , in addition to the one in the potential well . since the ground state energy calculated by a functional is approximately the exact ground state energy plus the sie produced by that functional , @xmath44 turning points occur when @xmath45 equals the derivative of the exact curve , _",

    "[ fig : sie](b ) , for sufficient @xmath28 value ( 0.2 bohr@xmath41 or more ) , this factor can change the decay nature of the derivative magnitude , from power law to exponential . thus , the sie derivative magnitude curve of typical lc hybrid functionals can avoid second intersection with the derivative of the exact curve .",
    "global hybrid functionals simply scale down the sie derivative curve by a constant , so they can not avoid the second intersection , unless @xmath48 approaches unity .",

    "this means that the sr hf exchange is also important .",
    "in fact , the covalent ( symmetric ) state and the ionic ( symmetry - broken ) state are nearly degenerate by ccsd(t ) calculations @xcite .",
    "but most of the xc functionals can not predict that these two states are degenerate : due to the serious sie , they usually overstabilize the covalent state .",
    "therefore , functional which can predict that the ionic state is more stable than the covalent state ( _ i.e. _  the hemibonded structure will dissociate into h@xmath0o and h@xmath0o@xmath1 ) will give correct dissociation limit .",
    "very recently , a double - hybrid functional containing a very large fraction of hf exchange ( @xmath50 ) @xcite , has been shown to be promising for reducing the sies in hemibonded systems .",

    "since the hf theory , which provides the reference orbitals for computing the mp2 correlation energy , predicts the ionic state to be more stable than the covalent one .",

    "[ fig : doo](b ) shows that the @xmath28b97x-2(lp ) functional and the mp2 theory can predict the correct dissociation limits . while the b2plyp functional can not .    there is another way to define the dissociation behavior of the xc functionals : since many of the xc functionals can not predict that the hemibonded structure of the ionized water dimer will dissociate into h@xmath0o and h@xmath0o@xmath1 , we set the zeros of dissociation curves to their respective dissociation limits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dshift ] . in this definition ,",
    "we focus on the potential curve experienced by the two fragments during the dissociation process of the hemibonded structure .",
    "surprisingly , the dissociation curve of the @xmath28b97 functional is extremely close to that of the ccsd(t ) theory .",
    "this means that the @xmath28b97 gives the best potential energy curve toward the dissociation process .",
    "the previous suggested functionals @xcite , such as bh&hlyp , yield potential curves that are too shallow .",
    "functionals which predict symmetry - breaking solutions during the dissociation process ( e.g.  m06hf and @xmath28b97x-2(lp ) ) are found to yield the dissociation curves that are narrower than that of the ccsd(t ) theory .",
    "finally , we discuss the dissociation of the proton transferred structure of the water dimer cation . in this structure , the sies associated with functionals for this structure are not as large as those for the hemibonded structure , so all the dissociation curves are very similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dproton ] .",
    "the results of the water dimer radical cation using three criteria we proposed are summarized in table .",
    "[ table : conclusion ] .",
    "we find that the functional which performs well based on these three criteria is the @xmath28b97x-2(lp ) functional , yielding the accurate binding energies , relative energies , and the correct dissociation limit .",
    "however , this functional yields a dissociation curve of the hemibonded structure that is a little narrower than that of ccsd(t ) . for applications sensitive to the shape of potential of the hemibonded structure , we suggest to use @xmath28b97 :",
    "although this functional neither gives a dissociation curve of the hemibonded structure that converges to zero nor yields accurate binding energies , this functional gives a dissociation curve which has nearly the same shape as the curve calculated by ccsd(t ) .",
    "thus , we recommend this functional for researchers who like to perform the molecular dynamics of the water dimer cation .",
    "we have proposed three criteria to examine the performance of density functionals on water dimer radical cation , and explained why lc hybrid functionals generally work better than conventional density functionals for hemibonded systems .",
    "the previously recommended functional , bh&hlyp , can not dissociate the hemibonded structure of the water dimer cation into the correct fragments : h@xmath0o and h@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the bh&hlyp dissociation curve displays an unphysical repulsive barrier , and is too shallow for molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "such a spurious barrier could be removed by functionals with very large fractions of hf exchange ( e.g.  m06hf and @xmath28b97x-2(lp ) ) .",
    "lc hybrid functionals , such as the @xmath28b97 series , are shown to be accurate for dissociation curves of the hemibonded structure ( _ i.e. _  no spurious barriers ) , and thus are suitable for molecular dynamics simulations of larger - size systems . for research which is sensitive to the dissociation curve experienced by the fragments of the hemibonded structure , we recommend the use of the @xmath28b97 functional . for researchers who do not sure",
    "which criterion is the most important factor during the simulation of water dimer radical cation , we recommend the use of the @xmath28b97x-2(lp ) functional , which is overall good throughout those three criteria we proposed .",
    "we first reproduce estimate  ( [ eq : sie ] ) for the sie of symmetric radical cations by global hybrid or pure density functionals @xcite .",
    "since most xc functionals predict that the covalent state is more stable than the ionic state , the sie of the covalent state is of interest . neglecting the small sie in the correlation energy , we have @xmath51 because the sie is small in the ionic state , @xmath52 it is favorable to express @xmath53 and @xmath54 in terms of the coulomb self - interaction energy for the ionic state @xmath55 , or simply @xmath33 in subsection [ subsect : disso ] .",
    "this can be done by substituting the density of the delocalized @xmath4 electron ( which causes the serious sie of the hemibonding systems @xcite ) in the covalent state with the density of that electron in the ionic state .",
    "note that there are two situations for the ionic state : one is the electric charge localized in fragment a and the other is the electric charge localized in fragment b. to a good approximation the density of the delocalized @xmath4 electron of the covalent state can be expressed as @xmath56 the coulomb self - interaction for the covalent state can be expressed as @xmath57 if one assumes that @xmath37 is large compared to the spatial extent of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
