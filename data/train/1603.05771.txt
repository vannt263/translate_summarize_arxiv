    "drifting subpulses appear as a modulation of pulsar radio emission in which subpulses drift through the ( integrated ) pulse window . the separation in time between two adjacent subpulses",
    "is denoted by @xmath0 @xcite , which is shorter than @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the rotation frequency of the star . in the carousel model",
    "@xcite subpulses are interpreted as emission from plasma columns distributed uniformly around the magnetic pole and rotating at @xmath5 .",
    "one possible interpretation of the `` plasma columns '' is in terms of anti - nodes of a wave - like structure , generated by a large - scale instability in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the diocotron instability seems a plausible generation mechanism @xcite . assuming a wave at a specific spherical harmonic grows preferentially @xcite , the resulting pattern is proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath2 are integers and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , relative to the magnetic axis .",
    "such a pattern , @xmath10 , corresponds to @xmath2 anti - nodes .",
    "the wave structure may be propagating relative to the magnetospheric plasma , but for simplicity the structures are usually assumed to be comoving with the plasma . a detailed model for drifting subpulses",
    "is needed to use the data to determine the actual motion of magnetospheric plasma , and hence to provide information on the electrodynamical processes that drive this motion .",
    "a model for drifting subpulses also needs to accommodate other observational features , such as curved driftbands and abrupt changes in @xmath11 , so that these may be used to infer further details regarding the magnetosphere .",
    "curved driftbands are common in radio pulsars that exhibit drifting subpulses @xcite .",
    "the `` curvature '' describes how @xmath0 varies across the pulse window .",
    "there is evidence , from observations at both radio and @xmath12-ray frequencies , that a pulsar magnetosphere may switch between different rotation states , affecting the subpulse drift pattern @xcite . by `` rotation state '' we mean a specific value of @xmath11 ( in the emission region ) , and",
    "the evidence implies that a pulsar may jump abruptly between two or more different rotation states . a model for non - corotational motion",
    "is needed to describe the rotation states between which such jumps occur .",
    "in this paper we consider a model for drifting subpulses that combines a quantitative model for the non - corotational motion ( of the magnetosphere of an oblique rotator ) and an effect that has conventionally been ignored : the apparent motion of the visible point .",
    "our objectives are to develop a quantitative model for the non - corotational motion and apply it to observed changes associated with jumps between rotation states , and to explore the implications of the motion of the visible point on subpulses , specifically , the observed variations of @xmath0 in drifting subpulses .    our quantitative model @xcite is based on an interpolation of the plasma motions between two limiting cases .",
    "one limit corresponds to the vacuum - dipole model , in which there is no plasma , and the ( inductive ) electric field , @xmath13 , is determined by the rotating magnetic dipole . in this case",
    ", any test charge has an electric drift across the magnetic field lines , at a velocity @xmath14 say .",
    "we interpret @xmath14 as the plasma flow velocity in the limit where the plasma density is arbitrarily small , such that there are too few charges to provide the ( additional ) potential field implied by corotation .",
    "the other limit corresponds to corotation , in which case the plasma velocity across the magnetic field lines is the perpendicular component of the corotation velocity , @xmath15 say , which is the electric drift in the corotation electric field , @xmath16 .",
    "( the plasma motion along the magnetic field lines is unconstrained by the electrodynamics . )",
    "we consider a one - parameter class of rotation states described by the parameter @xmath17 , such that the actual plasma motion across the field lines is @xmath18 . by construction",
    "this model satisfies the requirement that the flow pattern is periodic , with period @xmath19 , although the motion of an individual plasma blob is not periodic ( except for @xmath20 ) . in this model ,",
    "an abrupt change in rotation state is parametrized by a change in @xmath17 .",
    "the apparent motion of the visible point follows from the long - accepted assumption that pulsar emission is confined to a tiny cone about the tangent to the local magnetic field line @xcite .",
    "this implies that emission is visible only by an observer whose line of sight is parallel to the local magnetic field line .",
    "the line of sight to this `` visible point '' varies in the transverse direction with the phase of an oblique rotator , so that the visible point moves around a trajectory at an apparent velocity that is determined purely by geometry and the assumed magnetic field structure @xcite .",
    "( existing models for drifting subpulses are based on the implicit , but incorrect , assumption that the line of sight is a fixed line , e.g. , through the center of the star . )    in section [ sect : visibility ] we discuss the apparent motion of the visible point . in section [ sect:3periods ]",
    "we summarize three motions that can contribute to the observed @xmath0 .",
    "variations in @xmath0 are discussed in section [ sect : p2variations ] in three different , but related , contexts , and a test case using psr b0031 - 07 for our model is considered .",
    "we discuss the results and summarize our conclusions in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize the viewing geometry @xcite assumed in this paper .",
    "the angular position of the visible point on a sphere of radius @xmath21 is independent of @xmath21 in a dipolar magnetic field .",
    "let this position be described by polar and azimuthal angles , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in the observer s frame , or by @xmath24 , where the subscript @xmath25 represents quantities in the magnetic frame . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to the viewing angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight and the obliquity angle between the rotation and magnetic axes , respectively , and @xmath1 is the rotational phase of the pulsar .",
    "the transformation matrix between the two coordinate systems is given in appendix [ sec : coordtansf ] .",
    "the visible point in the magnetic frame is then given by @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "for given @xmath30 the visible point traces out a closed path ( on the sphere of radius @xmath21 ) in one pulsar rotation , which we refer to as the trajectory of the visible point .",
    "the visibility of pulsar emission is dictated by the trajectory of the visible point whose geometry depends strongly on @xmath30 ( see figure [ fig - trajmeetnodes ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is maximum at @xmath32 and minimum at @xmath33 .",
    "the traditional approach , in which the line of sight is assumed fixed , is a valid approximation only in the limiting cases of @xmath34 .",
    "we ignore the special case @xmath35 in the following discussion .    assuming that pulsar emission comes only from open - field regions restricts the source location to radii greater than a minimum visible height , @xmath36 . for given @xmath30 one",
    "has @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angle measured from the rotation axis to the point where the last closed field line is tangent to the light cylinder .",
    "emission is visible only while the trajectory of the visible point is inside the open - field region , and the maximum width of the pulse window is the range of @xmath1 over which this condition is satisfied .",
    "this width increases with increasing @xmath39 and reduces to a point for @xmath40 . the pulse window is centered on @xmath41 , where the rotation axis , magnetic axis and the line of sight are coplanar .",
    "the pulse width increases as the impact parameter , defined by @xmath42 , decreases .      a unique emission location in the magnetosphere may be defined by assuming that observable emission is only from the last closed field lines . in this model ,",
    "the radial distance from the center of the star to any points on the field line at @xmath9 , which is a function of @xmath1 ( see appendix a ) , can be determined using equation ( 2 ) with polar angles given by the trajectory of the visible point and known field line constant .",
    "observable emission in the magnetosphere is therefore specified by @xmath43 on each last closed field lines around a pulsar .",
    "these parameters vary with pulsar phase , with @xmath36 having its minimum at @xmath32 and its maximum at @xmath44 .",
    "it is only in the aligned case , @xmath45 , that @xmath36 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the height ( or radius @xmath21 ) of the source of pulsar radio emission is poorly determined , and is usually estimated based on one of two methods : ( i ) a relativistic phase shift , which requires an asymmetric pulse profile with clearly defined core and cone components @xcite , or ( ii ) geometry alone , with the source located on the last closed field lines @xcite .",
    "we assume model ( ii ) .",
    "this implies that emission is visible from only one point in the magnetosphere for any given @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if one assumes a unique radius - to - frequency mapping , then ( ii ) implies that emission at a given frequency is visible from only one height .    assumption ( ii )",
    "may be modified to relax the implied unique radius - to - frequency mapping .",
    "the emission is confined to a narrow forward cone ( half - angle @xmath46 , where @xmath12 is the lorentz factor of the emitting particle ) , which is at a small angle to the magnetic field line due to aberration , so that there is some spread in emission about the direction tangent to the field line .",
    "more importantly , one expects emission from at least a small range of field lines inside the last closed field line , and this translates into emission over a corresponding small range of heights @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath2 emission sites , corresponding to anti - nodes , that are equally spaced in azimuth around the magnetic axis .",
    "the location of the anti - nodes is then independent of polar angle corresponding to alignment along the radial direction in a structure of radial spokes as illustrated in figure [ fig - trajmeetnodes ] .",
    "the trajectory of the visible point intersects the spokes at different polar angles , @xmath8 .",
    "the green , blue and red curves correspond to non - circular trajectories of the visible point in specific oblique models , and the dark black circle corresponds to a circular trajectory in a specific aligned case .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that , for an oblique rotator , the trajectory is not concentric with the magnetic axis ( e.g. , red , blue and green ) , and need not enclose the magnetic axis ( e.g. , red and green ) .",
    "moreover , it is only in the aligned case that all anti - nodes are potentially visible ( when the restriction to emission only from within the polar cap is relaxed ) ; for example , fewer than 50% of the spokes are intersected by the red trajectory . in traditional models",
    "@xcite , the number of anti - nodes is estimated from observation by implicitly assuming that all are visible in principle , as for an aligned rotator .",
    "this corresponds to the black curve , which is a circle centered on the magnetic pole .",
    "we conclude , based on figure [ fig - trajmeetnodes ] , that it is important to treat the geometry correctly , rather than identifying potentially observable subpulses from a single emission circle .    :",

    "are radial spoke structure of aligned anti - nodes spaced equally around the star ( black sold circle ) in the magnetic frame centered on the magnetic pole .",
    "a trajectory starts at a point on the @xmath52-axis closest to the origin at @xmath53 then progresses in clockwise direction and intersects with the @xmath52-axis again at the farthest point from the origin reaching the highest height of the path at @xmath33 , then returns to the starting point .",
    "emission is visible in principle only from a spoke that is inside the relevant trajectory . ]",
    "note that the restriction to emission from within the polar cap is not taken into account in figure [ fig - trajmeetnodes ] .",
    "the number of spokes intersected by a trajectory , and hence the number of visible anti - nodes , depends strongly on @xmath54 , with @xmath36 given by equation ( [ eq : minscrheight ] ) , and for a given @xmath55 the polar - cap region defines an additional closed region in the figure @xcite . for the model discussed in section [ sect : modelvisibleemission ] , the trajectory cuts spokes at different @xmath56 and hence at different heights , implying that emission is from higher ( lower ) altitudes at the edges ( center ) of a profile @xcite .",
    "three frequencies are relevant to a model for subpulse drifting : ( i ) the spin frequency of the star , @xmath57 , ( ii ) a frequency , @xmath58 , associated with the motion of the visible point , and ( iii ) the drift frequency of the plasma , @xmath59 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how these frequencies relate to @xmath0 .",
    "the visible point moves at an angular velocity @xmath60 along the trajectory with components in the polar and azimuthal directions : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the angular speed of the star .",
    "the motion of the visible point is absent only for an aligned rotator , @xmath45 .",
    "another special case is for the line of sight along the rotation axis , when the visible point moves only in the @xmath63 direction as the pulsar rotates . in the general case , the visible point sub -",
    "rotates when the magnetic axis is on the near side of the pulsar ( near @xmath64 ) , and super - rotates when the magnetic axis is on the far side of the pulsar ( near @xmath65 ) .",

    ", the observer sees only a small range of @xmath67 centered on @xmath68 where @xmath69 is lowest .",
    "the plasma drift velocity is modeled here as a linear combination of the electric drift velocities in the vacuum - dipole and corotation models @xcite . for an obliquely rotating pulsar the electric field",
    "is assumed to be of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the unit vector along the direction of the magnetic field , and where @xmath72 is the potential electric field associated with the corotation charge density .",

    "we use the projected component for the following calculations .",
    "a purely magnetospheric model for drifting subpulses , as opposed to a model related to structures ( e.g. , `` hot spots '' ) on the surface of the star , requires that there be some quasi - stable structure in the source region .",

    "deviation from a dipolar field , @xmath156 , is always present in an oblique rotator , due to retardation implying an inductive term @xmath157 and the radiative term @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "another possible modification to a centered dipolar field is an additional crust - anchored dipolar field @xcite .",
    "emission from such non - dipolar configurations can result in the center of the profile being shifted away from @xmath32 .",
    "this would break the symmetry in the variations of @xmath0 .",
    "field - line distortion affects single - peak profiles , causing a difference in @xmath0 about a fiducial point ( @xmath32 in our model ) .",
    "the sign of the difference signifies the rotation direction such that positive and negative values correspond to leftward and rightward rotations , respectively , relative to the line of sight .    in principle , it is possible to use data on @xmath0 to determine the rotation state , or at least to restrict the allowed range of @xmath17 , as shown in section [ sect : testcase ] .",
    "for example , in the case of psr b0031 - 07 with duty cycle of about 0.1 , a match in the predicted variations of @xmath0 across different @xmath21 with observations is found to correspond to @xmath159 . to achieve higher accuracy",
    "requires precise knowledge of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for most pulsars ,",
    "however , these two parameters are uncertain , limiting the reliability of any comparison between predictions and observations .",
    "a further uncertainty arises from an angular error introduced by the ( incorrect ) assumption that the line of sight passes through center of the star .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of @xmath27 , for @xmath160 , or to an underestimation of @xmath27 , for @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "the observable effects discussed in this paper are relatively small for most pulsars , especially for those with large @xmath27 and narrow pulse profiles .",
    "future availability of large arrays and telescopes , such as the ska and fast , will provide wide bandwidth coverage and unparallel sensitivity and time resolution , and will allow one to map the small changes in the subpulse driftbands predicted here .",
    "this will lead to a new era in investigating magnetospheric phenomena , significantly improve our understanding of drifting subpulses and of pulsar electrodynamics more generally .",
    "we summarize our results in dot - point form .    *",
    "the path traced by the visible point on a sphere of radius @xmath21 in any pulsar magnetospheres is neither circular nor centered at the magnetic axis , except for special cases .",
    "* emission is assumed to be confined to anti - nodes which form spokes relative to the magnetic axis .",
    "a given spoke is visible only if trajectory of the visible point crosses it . *",
    "estimation from observation of the total number , @xmath2 , of anti - nodes or spokes is possible only for a narrow pulse profile or @xmath35 .",
    "* variations of @xmath0 result from the relative motion of drifting anti - nodes , at @xmath11 , and the visible point , at @xmath69 .",
    "* abrupt changes of @xmath0 at a given @xmath1 are attributed to switching in the magnetospheres between different rotation states , each characterized by unique @xmath17 and associated @xmath162 .",
    "* @xmath0 is a function of @xmath1 ; it is a minimum at @xmath32 and increases as @xmath1 increases ; the change in @xmath0 is small for @xmath163 , and for pulsars with narrow pulse profiles .",
    "* traditional models , which implicitly assume @xmath164 , give good approximations for @xmath0 only for pulsars with @xmath127 , @xmath97 and narrow pulse profiles .",
