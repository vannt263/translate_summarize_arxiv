    "the term dimer was introduced in the thirties @xcite as an abbreviation for diatomic molecules in a model for their adsorption on crystal surfaces .",
    "later dimer models were applied in the study of other physical systems such as ferroelectrics , and much is known about their thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "one relevant question in these models is the entropy associated to placing dimers on a regular lattice . for the particular case of full covering of the square lattice by dimers , this question was answered exactly some time ago , using a technique based on pfaffians @xcite .",
    "however , even the generalization of this problem for the case on partial covering of the square lattice is still an open question today , no exact result being known .    in this paper",
    "we address a generalization of the entropy of dimers problem , considering entropy related to covering the square lattice with chains with @xmath0 monomers each ( we will call them @xmath0-mers ) , as a function of the fraction @xmath1 of sites of the lattice occupied by monomers .",
    "the chains will be considered flexible , so that there is no energy associated to bending them .",
    "since the only energy in the model is the infinite excluded volume interaction , which forbids the presence of more than one monomer on the same lattice site , the problem is athermal .",
    "it may be a simple model for the adsorption of monodisperse flexible chains on the surface of a crystal .",
    "besides the exact solution of the problem for @xmath7 and @xmath5 mentioned above , other cases were already considered in the literature .",
    "rather precise transfer matrix calculations were performed in the polymer limit @xmath8 for hamiltonian walks ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "there are also mean - field approximations @xcite , bethe - and husimi lattice calculations @xcite , and series expansions in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of first neighbors of each site in the lattice @xcite , and in those calculations approximate values for the entropy are obtained for both the full ( @xmath5 ) and partial ( @xmath6 ) coverage cases .    in this paper",
    "we obtain estimates for the entropy of flexible @xmath0-mers placed on the square lattice , using transfer matrix techniques .",
    "this is done calculating numerically exact values for the entropy of the problem on strips with finite widths @xmath2 and periodic boundary conditions and then using finite - size scaling to extrapolate the results to the two - dimensional limit @xmath11 .",
    "we separate the problem in cases where @xmath0 is finite or infinite ( polymer limit ) .",
    "also , the case of full coverage ( @xmath5 ) may be treated separately from the general case . in the general case , it is convenient to address the problem in an ensemble which is grand - canonical with respect to the number of monomers placed on the lattice , whereas for full coverage it is easier to perform a microcanonical calculation .",
    "the expressions we used to calculate the entropy are shown in section [ entro ] .",
    "the model is discussed in more detail and the transfer matrices are described in section [ tm ] .",
    "our results for the entropies may be found in section [ nr ] , as well as the extrapolation procedure and their results .",
    "section [ conc ] presents final discussions and conclusions .",
    "for the case of full coverage , it is convenient to obtain the entropy directly from boltzmann s expression @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of ways to fill the lattice with @xmath14 sites completely with @xmath0-mers . in the polymer limit @xmath4",
    ", we consider a _",
    "hamiltonian walk , that is , a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) which visits all sites of the lattice .    in the general case where a fraction @xmath1 of lattice sites is occupied by monomers ,",
    "we define the grand - canonical partition function @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the activity of a monomer and @xmath17 is the number of ways to place @xmath18 chains with @xmath0 monomers each on the lattice with @xmath14 sites . for the polymer limit ,",
    "again a single saw is placed on the lattice and the partition function is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of ways to place a saw with @xmath21 monomers on the @xmath14-site lattice .",
    "the density of monomers may now be written as @xmath22 where the thermodynamic potential per lattice site is defined as @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit , a legendre transformation allows us to rewrite the potential as @xmath24 and thus the entropy may be written as @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "we proceed defining a strip of width @xmath2 on the square lattice in the @xmath27 plane , so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "a transfer matrix may be built for this problem , inspired on the prescription due to derrida @xcite for infinite chains in strips .",
    "we thus consider the operation of including an additional step to the strip in the positive @xmath30 direction , adding @xmath2 new sites of the lattice . to properly take into account the statistical weight of the new step",
    ", we may define the state of the @xmath2 vertical bonds of the lattice which are incident to the new sites by specifying :    1 .   the number of monomers already present in the chain which passes through the vertical bond ( it is equal to 0 if no chain is present ) .",
    "these numbers may be put into a vector @xmath31 , with @xmath2 components .",
    "it is necessary to keep track of this information so that we know when to end each chain .",
    "2 .   the pairs of bonds which are connected to each other through a path lying entirely below the reference line ( see figure [ ex1 ] ) .",
    "these pairs may be also be specified by a @xmath2-component vector @xmath32 , associating a different positive integer to each pair of connected bonds and 0 to the ones which are not connected to any other .",
    "this connectivity information prevents us from closing a ring at any level , since this configuration is not allowed in the model .",
    "vertical bonds .",
    "the reference line indicates the set of vertical bonds whose configuration is described.,height=113 ]    as an example of these definitions , we consider the case of pentamers ( @xmath33 ) placed on a strip of width @xmath34 . among the possible configurations of a set of vertical bonds , the one depicted in figure [ ex1 ]",
    "is described by the vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "elements of the line associated to this state of the transfer matrix @xmath37 are obtained considering the possible continuations of the state @xmath38 one step upwards , as shown in two examples in figure [ ex2 ] .",
    "the resulting state in figure [ ex2].a is described by the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , while the final state in figure [ ex2].b corresponds to the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "( reference line rl).,title=\"fig:\",height=117 ]   ( reference line rl).,title=\"fig:\",height=117 ]    each monomer placed on a site between the two sets of vertical bonds contributes with an activity @xmath16 to the partition function , so that the element of the transfer matrix which corresponds to the first configuration is equal to @xmath43 , while the second configuration is associated to an element equal to @xmath44 in the transfer matrix .",
    "only the second configuration contributes in the case of full occupancy .    for the polymer case @xmath4 , a single chain passes through the whole strip , so that it is enough to describe the connectivity at a particular set of @xmath2 vertical bonds by indicating the bond which is connected to the initial monomer of the chain ( in @xmath45 ) and the pairs of bonds connected to each other , exactly as was done in the original work of derrida @xcite .",
    "thus , a single vector @xmath32 is enough to describe the state in this limit .",
    "once the transfer matrix @xmath37 is obtained , the entropy of the model on the strip in the thermodynamic limit is related to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix . for the case of full occupancy ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the number of configurations is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of sites and the elements of the matrix @xmath48 are defined by the limit @xmath49 the entropy is then related to the largest eigenvalue @xmath50 of this matrix , so that @xmath51    for the general case , where a fraction @xmath1 of lattice sites are occupied by monomers , the grand - canonical partition function is related to the transfer matrix through @xmath52 and thus the density @xmath53 will be @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath37 . this relation may be inverted to obtain the entropy as a function of the density using equation [ entden ] .",
    "the size of the transfer matrix increases very fast with both the molecular weight @xmath0 and the width @xmath2 of the strip grow .",
    "this sets an upper limit to the widths we were able to consider for each chain of a given molecular weight .",
    "figure [ cres ] shows this effect , and in the inset one may appreciate that the growth of the transfer matrix is roughly exponential .     and width of the strip @xmath56 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]   and width of the strip @xmath56 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    furthermore , as was already observed in similar calculations for polymers @xcite , the values of the entropy for each class of @xmath0-mers are split into subsets with different finite - size scaling behavior in each subset according to the width of the strips , so that extrapolations must be done within each subset .",
    "these splitting seems to be related to frustration effects in the limit of the fully occupied lattice and the subsets are indicated in table [ sep ] , where all the widths we considered are given .",
    ".entropies calculated for each @xmath0-mer , divided in subsets with the same finite - size scaling behavior [ sep ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the polymer limit @xmath4 , the model of a polymer placed on a strip in the grand - canonical ensemble displays a first order phase transition at a critical activity @xmath57 , with the coexistence of a non - polymerized phase ( @xmath58 ) and a polymerized phase ( @xmath59 ) @xcite . as the width @xmath2 of the strip is increased , the discontinuity in the density at the transition becomes smaller and in the two - dimensional limit @xmath60 a continuous transition is found at @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the entropy of a polymer on a strip of finite width is therefore not defined for @xmath62 , as may be seen in figure [ polex ] , where the extrapolated value of the entropy as a function of the density for polymers is depicted . as larger widths are considered ,",
    "the step in the entropy decreases and in the two - dimensional limit we have @xmath63 .",
    "in this paper we estimate the entropy of chains with @xmath0 monomers each placed on the square lattice as a function of the fraction @xmath1 of lattice sites occupied by monomers .",
    "the estimates were obtained by extrapolating numerically exact values for the entropy on strips of finite widths @xmath2 , calculated using a transfer matrix approach , to the two - dimensional limit @xmath60 .",
    "a particular case where results may easily be obtained analytically is the one dimensional problem ( @xmath64 ) . in this case , the dimension of the transfer matrix @xmath37 is equal to @xmath0 , and we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "one may easily obtain the secular equation of this matrix , which is @xmath67 the density may then be found as a function of the largest eigenvalue @xmath55 through using the secular equation above and also expression [ rho ] .",
    "one obtains @xmath68 where @xmath69 . then the entropy may be found by performing the integration in equation [ entden ] changing the integration variable from @xmath1 to @xmath55 .",

    "the entropy in the one - dimensional case vanishes , as expected , for @xmath5 , and the maximum is located at a value of the density which is equal to 1/2 for monomers ( @xmath71 ) increasing monotonically with @xmath72 and approaching 1 in the polymer limit @xmath73 ( figure [ maximum ] ) , where the entropy vanishes for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "the value of the maximum entropy is a decreasing function of @xmath72 .      for a given value of @xmath0 ,",
