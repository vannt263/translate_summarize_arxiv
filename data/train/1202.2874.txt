    "the origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies @xmath7 ev is an intriguing mystery in modern astrophysics .",
    "their sources are generally believed to be extragalactic objects , although some galactic objects may also be viable . in either case",
    ", the maximum energy of @xmath8 ev can only be achieved in extreme environments @xcite .",
    "prominent source candidates suggested so far include active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , neutron stars or magnetars @xcite and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "if uhecrs with energies above @xmath9 ev are mainly protons , their propagation distance should be limited by interactions with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons @xcite , the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) mechanism , so that they are observable only from sources sufficiently nearby ( typically @xmath10 mpc ) .",
    "since all known astrophysical objects are distributed inhomogeneously at such distances in the local universe , anisotropies in the distribution of uhecr arrival directions are expected as long as cosmic magnetic fields are weak enough to allow quasi - rectilinear propagation of the uhecrs .",
    "searches for correlations between the arrival directions and the celestial positions of potential source candidates should then provide valuable clues to reveal their origin @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) operating in the southern hemisphere has reported possible evidence of a gradual increase in the average mass of uhecr particles with energies above @xmath11 ev by analyzing the average depth of the shower maximum @xmath12 and the root mean square of the shower - to - shower fluctuations of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , assuming that current hadronic interaction models are realistic at these energies @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to measurements of similar quantities for the northern sky by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment that are consistent with an uhecr composition dominated by protons @xcite .",
    "if uhecrs consisted mainly of heavy nuclei rather than protons as indicated by the pao results , their deflections during propagation in magnetized extragalactic and galactic environments would be much larger than those for protons , and the hopes for observing anisotropy may be considerably weakened . on the other hand ,",
    "pao has seen statistically significant correlations between the arrival directions of uhecrs with energies above @xmath9 ev and the projected positions of agn with @xmath15 within an angular scale of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this does not necessarily point to agn as the true sources , since they may only be tracers of the more numerous population of galaxies that make up the anisotropic , local cosmic matter distribution , and there are also considerable uncertainties in the angular displacement due to deflections by both the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) and the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "nevertheless , this does imply that uhecr sources are associated with the matter distribution .",
    "independent analyses of the pao data have confirmed the correlations of uhecr arrival directions with various kinds of nearby astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "such correlations were predicted in several theoretical studies under the assumption of protons as the primary uhecr particles @xcite .",
    "we must beware that at the moment , the positional correlations ( or anisotropy ) are observed only _ above _ @xmath9 ev , whereas the pao results on the composition are available only _ up to _",
    "@xmath9 ev due to the lack of event statistics .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that protons become dominant above this energy and produce the anisotropy .",
    "however , there are presently no hints of such a sudden change in the composition , and the simplest extrapolation of the measured trends of @xmath12 and @xmath14 to higher energies would entail a composition dominated by heavy nuclei .",
    "since the appearance of anisotropies or cross correlations with astrophysical objects in the case of uhecr nuclei is not trivial , deeper , relevant studies of uhecr propagation are warranted in order to achieve a consistent interpretation of the current data set as well as to quantify the prospects for future observations .",
    "propagation of uhe nuclei has been studied previously by many authors from various perspectives @xcite .",
    "many have studied the photodisintegration process and consequent spectra in detail without accounting for magnetic fields , but only a few have focused on the effects of the magnetic fields . ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the propagation of uhe nuclei in a uniform turbulent egmf model and examined their trajectories and photodisintegration interactions in intergalactic photon fields , concluding that a characteristic feature in the spectrum may result .",
    "@xcite discussed the propagation of nuclei in a structured egmf model obtained through a numerical simulation of cosmological structure formation , showing that while heavy nuclei can be strongly deflected ( @xmath17 ) by the egmf , nuclei ( and their secondaries ) with relatively small deflections can generate anisotropy on intermediate angular scales .",
    "in this paper , we study the propagation of uhecr nuclei in cosmic radiation and magnetic fields under different assumptions for the source properties and the fields , focusing on the resulting distribution of arrival directions .",
    "in addition to a detailed treatment of the photopair , photomeson and photodisintegration interactions of uhe nuclei with background photons , deflections in gmf and egmf are taken into account for both primary nuclei as well as secondary nuclei arising from photodisintegration . by statistically analyzing the calculated arrival distributions ,",
    "we discuss the implications for current and future observations of anisotropy and cross correlations with sources .    motivated by the recent pao result",
    ", we adopt a model for the uhecr source distribution that follows the density of large - scale structure actually observed in the local universe .",
    "this is in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite who took the sources to be related to the matter distribution in a numerical simulation , but not reflecting the actual universe .",
    "because photodisintegration limits the propagation distance of heavy nuclei in a way similar to the gzk mechanism for protons , a realistic account of local source inhomogeneity is essential . unlike most previous work on the subject",
    ", here we also account for the gmf as well as the egmf , since the former unavoidably affects all uhecrs arriving at earth . concerning the uhecr source composition , a wide variety of possibilities",
    "are currently allowed that are consistent with both the observed spectrum and the composition indicators @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this study assumes a pure iron composition , which can also reproduce the highest - energy spectrum , and which would be the most pessimistic situation for producing anisotropy or source correlations in view of their large magnetic deflections .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows . in section [ method ]",
    "we describe our models and methods of calculation and statistical analysis .",

    "a nucleus emits its constituent nucleons by interactions with photons ( _ photodisintegration _ ) .",
    "since the number of emitted nucleons per interaction is stochastically determined following branching ratios dependent on interaction energy , a lot of disintegration paths are realized during propagation in photon fields .",
    "however , all the branches in photodisintegration are not well known yet .",
    "this study adopts a simple disintegration track on the nuclear chart proposed by ref .",
    "there is only one nuclear species for each nuclear mass number @xmath18 in this treatment .",
    "photodisintegration can be phenomenologically classified into 4 processes : giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , quasi - deuteron ( qd ) process , baryonic resonance ( br ) , and photofragmentation ( pf ) . since the importance of the latter two processes appears above @xmath19 ev for fe nuclei in the cmb because of their very high threshold energy ( fig .",

    "while the scaling laws on @xmath18 can well reproduce experimental data for large @xmath18 nuclei , the behavior of small nuclei ( @xmath34 ) is different because of their small number of nucleons .",
    "thus , other analytical functions of the cross - sections are used for deuteron , trinucleon ( triton or @xmath35 ) , helium , and @xmath36be instead of @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath36be is assumed to decay into two @xmath39he and one nucleon .",
    "we also assume that a nucleus with @xmath40 which is produced by qd of a particle with @xmath41 immediately decay into two @xmath39he because there is no stable particle with @xmath40 .",

    "galaxy surveys have confirmed through galaxy distribution that matter distribution is highly structured .",
    "since magnetic fields has been also amplified through the compression and dynamo mechanism of astrophysical plasmas simultaneously , they could be also structured following the matter distribution .",
    "several simulations of cosmological structure formation with magnetic fields have confirmed this expectation qualitatively @xcite , but egmf structures highly depend on modeling due to few observational constraints .",
    "the difference appears , for example , in the volume filling factor of strong egmfs ( see ref . ) .",
    "therefore , a variety of egmf modelings gives us different results on the deflection of uhecrs and source identification possibility even for protons @xcite .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty , it is technically difficult to calculate the arrival distribution of uhecrs with a complex egmf structure because only a very small fraction of uhecrs injected from sources can arrive at the earth .",
    "@xcite developed a numerical method to solve this problem for uhe protons , but this method can not apply to the cases of heavy nuclei owing to the stochastic nature of photodisintegration . in order to avoid the uncertainty of egmf modeling and the numerical difficulty",

    "both the components significantly contribute to the total deflections of uhe nuclei @xcite .",

    "however , it does not affect the propagation in the galaxy because particles traveled for longer distances than the mean free path in extragalactic space before entering the milky way .",
    "thus , the nuclear reactions can be neglected during the propagation in the galaxy .",

    "<S> recent results from the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) indicate that the composition of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies above @xmath0 ev may be dominated by heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> an important question is whether the distribution of arrival directions for such uhecr nuclei can exhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their astrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by intervening magnetic fields . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated the propagation of uhecr nuclei including models for both the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) and the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) . we find that the gmf is particularly crucial for suppressing the anisotropy as well as source correlations . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that only iron nuclei are injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially distributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local universe , at the number of events published by the pao so far ( 69 events above @xmath1 ev ) , the arrival distribution of uhecrs would be consistent with no auto - correlation at 95% confidence if the mean number density of uhecr sources @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 , and consistent with no cross - correlation with sources within 95% errors for @xmath4 mpc@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , with 1000 events above @xmath1 ev in the whole sky , next generation experiments can reveal auto - correlation with more than 99% probability even for @xmath5 mpc@xmath3 , and cross - correlation with sources with more than 99% probability for @xmath6 mpc@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the contribution of centaurus a is required to reproduce the currently observed uhecr excess in the centaurus region . </S>",
    "<S> secondary protons generated by photodisintegration of primary heavy nuclei during propagation play a crucial role in all cases , and the resulting anisotropy at small angular scales should provide a strong hint of the source location if the maximum energies of the heavy nuclei are sufficiently high .    </S>",
