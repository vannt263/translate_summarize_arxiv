    "the aim of combinatorial optimization is to find good approximations to the solution(s ) of minimization problems .",
    "many of the most famous algorithms currently used in this field @xcite were inspired by analogies with physical systems . among them",
    "the most celebrated is _ thermal simulated annealing _ @xcite proposed in 1983 by kirkpatrick _",
    "et al . _ : the space of all admissible solutions is endowed with a potential profile dependent on the cost function associated to the optimization problem .",
    "the exploration of this space is represented by a temperature dependent random walk .",
    "an opportunely scheduled temperature lowering ( annealing ) stabilizes then the walk around a , hopefully global , minimum of the potential profile .",
    "+ the _ quantum annealing _ approach to combinatorial optimization @xcite , instead , was originally suggested by the behaviour the stochastic process @xmath0 associated @xcite to the ground state @xmath1 of a hamiltonian of the form : @xmath2 where the potential function @xmath3 encodes the cost function to be minimized . the behavior of @xmath4 is characterized by long sojourns around the stable configurations , i.e. minima of @xmath5 , interrupted by rare large fluctuations which carry @xmath4 from one minimum to another : @xmath4 in thus allowed to `` tunnel '' away from local minima to the global minimum of @xmath5 .",
    "the deep analysis of the semiclassical limit performed in @xcite shows , indeed , that as @xmath6 _ `` the process will behave much like a markov chain whose state space is discrete and given by the stable configurations''_. + however , the ground state of @xmath7 is seldom exactly known and approximations are required .",
    "one of the earliest proposals in this direction , advanced in @xcite and applied in @xcite , was to construct an unnormalized approximation of @xmath8 by acting on a suitably chosen initial condition @xmath9 with the hamiltonian semigroup @xmath10 , namely by solving , with the initial condition @xmath11 , the _ imaginary time _",
    "schrdinger equation .",
    "similar ideas appear in the chemical physics literature @xcite and , with more specific reference to the optimization problems considered here , in @xcite .",
    "yet , the inability to autonomously construct the ground state process , without recourse to the unphysical step of imaginary time evolution , substantially detracts from what is otherwise a physical route to optimization by dynamical evolution toward the ground state .",
    "+ in this note , encouraged by the progress in quantum annealing in the last twenty years , as reviewed for instance in @xcite , by its close relationship with adiabatic quantum computation @xcite and by proposals of its hardware implementation @xcite , we try to eliminate the above unphysical step : we try to implement , instead of imaginary time evolution , the idea of reaching the ground state with the help of viscous friction @xcite .",
    "+ we first introduce the nonlinear schrdinger - langevin - kostin ( slk ) equation and illustrate , by means of examples on two toy models , how a frictional force acts in the continuous case . then we turn to quantum combinatorial optimization and show how dissipation can , in the discrete case , balance genuinely quantum effects , such as bloch oscillations and anderson localization , which can hinder the search of optimal solutions .",
    "the slk equation is the analogue of the heisenberg - langevin equation and represents a quantum analogue of classical motion with frictional force proportional to velocity @xcite ; it can be seen as a rough analogue of the classical drude - lorentz model of ohmic friction , i.e. an approximate description of the motion of a quantum particle through matter with inelastic scattering . + a solution @xmath12 of the equation : @xmath13 satisfies the inequality for , @xmath7 being the hamiltonian ( [ eq : schr1 ] ) .",
    "what we will show below is how the _ norm preserving _ dissipative evolution described by ( [ eq : slk ] ) can dynamically drive a suitable initial condition @xmath14 toward the ground state @xmath8 of @xmath7 . + * toy model 1 : * require @xmath15 ( the parameters @xmath16 being chosen so that @xmath17 ) to be the ground state of @xmath7 and to belong to the eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "the above two requirements determine the potential @xmath19 .",
    "+    figure [ fig : tela2008g2 ] follows the evolution @xmath20 of the initial condition @xmath21 under ( [ eq : slk ] ) for a time interval @xmath22 .",
    "it shows that , as @xmath23 decreases with time , the `` vacuum overlap '' @xmath24 approaches the value 1 . while the state @xmath25 approaches the ground state , some of the probability mass `` tunnels '' from the leftmost ( local ) to the rightmost ( global ) minimum .",
    "+ we point out that this class of examples , where both the ground state wave function @xmath8 and the ground state energy @xmath26 are known , allows also for the calibration of the numerical method . in our case we have used the built - in ` ndsolve ` resource of _ wolfram mathematica 6_. + * toy model 2 * : for the sake of comparison with classical literature on quantum annealing @xcite , we consider here a double - well potential of the form @xmath27 as shown in figure [ fig : tela2008g3a ] , for the parameters used there , the local minimum of the potential @xmath5 is wider than the global one .",
    "we refer the reader to section 2.2 of @xcite and to @xcite for a discussion of the meaning of the parameters and for the presentation of numerical experiments comparable with ours . here",
    ", we use this well known toy model as an example in which the ground state is _ unknown _ and the dissipative dynamics of slk type provides a method to find it . + while the initial condition evolves ( figure [ fig : tela2008g3a ] ) , the mean value of @xmath7 decreases as in figure [ fig : tela2008g3cd ] . that @xmath28 is a good approximation of the ground state",
    "is shown by comparing , in the inset of figure [ fig : tela2008g3cd ] , @xmath5 with the potential @xmath29 evaluated at @xmath30 , of which @xmath28 is the ground state belonging to the eigenvalue 0 .",
    "comparison of the two curves in the inset of figure [ fig : tela2008g3cd ] is , furthermore , suggestive of a real - time version of piela s _ method of deformation of the potential energy hypersurface _ @xcite .",
    "+ in the continuous case , then , the slk hamiltonian enriches quantum annealing of what can be seen as a _ probability percolation _",
    ": while the state of the system converges toward the ground state , some probability mass tunnels from one minimum to another and , instead of tunneling back , as would happen in a reversible dynamics , remains there .",
    "this autonomous stabilization would represent an alternative to _",
    "adiabatic quantum computation _ @xcite .",
    "most of the effort in ref .",
    "@xcite went into making the intuition developed so far available in a context of _ combinatorial _ optimization .",
    "in such a context the domain of the function @xmath3 to be minimized is a finite set @xmath31 and the search of the minimum of @xmath3 is modeled on a graph @xmath32 , where the edges @xmath33 describe the moves allowed in the search .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , @xmath31 was taken to be the boolean hypercube @xmath34 , for some positive integer @xmath35 , and an edge was placed between any two points in @xmath36 separated by a unit hamming distance .",
    "+ in this note , we consider the much simpler instance in which @xmath31 is , for some positive integer @xmath37 , the finite set @xmath38 equipped with the set of edges according to the general approach outlined in @xcite , this amounts to a search of the minimum of the function @xmath3 defined on @xmath39 by means of an interacting continuous time quantum walk @xcite on @xmath39 governed by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath40 we wish to show here that the _ quantum _ search outlined above can suffer from two , typically _ quantum _ , problems , namely bloch oscillations @xcite and anderson localization @xcite and that a certain amount of `` viscous '' friction can provide some relief to both these problems .",
    "+ on a finite box @xmath39 , we consider the evolution of an initial condition of the form @xmath41 .",
    "+    +    we refer the reader to section 5 of @xcite for a motivation of this choice : suffice here to say that it describes a spatially well located wave packet that in _ the absence of any potential _ moves back and forth , with speed close to 1 , inside the box @xmath39 , as in figure [ fig : tela2008g4a ] .",
    "the effect on this _ ballistic _ evolution of a linear potential @xmath42 is shown in figure [ fig : tela2008g4b ] . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the peculiar energy - momentum relation @xmath44 , holding on a discrete lattice , determines bloch oscillations that prevent the wave packet from approaching the point @xmath45 at which the minimum of the cost function @xmath5 is located .",
    "figure [ fig : tela2008g4b ] is therefore a reminder of the fact that a _ greedy _ quantum optimization driven by the cost function itself acting as a potential can be hindered by the fact that , on a lattice , increasing momentum @xmath46 can mean decreasing velocity @xmath47 . + we propose here to introduce a certain amount of viscous friction in the discrete schrdinger equation , as a `` kostin potential '' @xmath48 : @xmath49 the idea is that friction can prevent the momentum @xmath46 from crossing the first brillouin zone and thus can prevent the velocity @xmath50 from being inverted before the wave packet reaches the boundary of @xmath39 . this unwanted inversion is illustrated in figure [ fig : tela2008g4b ] , the effect on it of a suitable kostin potential is shown in figure [ fig : tela2008g4c ] . + as it is easy to check that , for @xmath25 evolving @xmath51 the actual form of @xmath52 that we adopt in order to achieve decrease of @xmath53 is , with @xmath54 .",
    "+    +     + figure [ fig : tela2008g5a ] shows , instead , the effect , in the form of anderson localization , of a random gaussian potential of mean 0 and variance @xmath55 , acting independently on each site of @xmath39 .",
    "the order of magnitude @xmath56 of the noise parameter @xmath57 is suggested by a scaling + whereas the fact that friction can wipe out bloch oscillations is well known @xcite , the less well known fact that we show here is that the pseudo - ballistic motion shown in figure [ fig : tela2008g4c ] is _ much more stable _ than the truly inertial motion represented in figure [ fig : tela2008g4a ] with respect to the onset of anderson localization .",
    "as a final remark , we observe that the same framework developed in this note for the combinatorial optimization metaphor can be used , with minor changes , to describe an excitation travelling along a spin chain or a light pulse propagating through a waveguide lattice @xcite .",
    "we conjecture , therefore , that slk dynamics can be exploited also in those fields .",
    "for example , we can , maybe , increase the fidelity of state transmission , in presence of imperfections , along a spin chain , by applying a `` tension '' at both ends of it @xcite ( see figure [ fig : tela2008g5d ] ) .",
    "the sole convergence toward the ground state could , instead , find applications in all - optical switching of light in waveguide arrays @xcite : the injected light pulse can be steered toward a given position by a suitable tuning of the thermal gradient which determines the potential profile of the lattice .",
    "future work should be devoted to further investigation of this open research problems .",
