    "it has long been known that the energy distribution of quasars , expressed as @xmath6 , must have a peak somewhere in the far - ultraviolet to soft x - ray region of the spectrum . shields ( 1978 )",
    "first suggested that the optical and near uv flux of quasars might be due to the rayleigh - jeans portion of a black body spectrum whose peak lies in the unobserved extreme uv region , arising from an optically thick accretion disk surrounding a massive black hole ( @xcite ) , and dubbed the `` big blue bump . ''",
    "this idea was then further developed and applied to uv observations of quasars obtained with iue ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was subsequently found that the x - ray spectra of quasars also showed a `` soft excess '' of flux , above the extrapolation of the relatively flat power - law that fit the spectrum at energies above 2 kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and which might arise from the wien portion of the same thermal spectrum .",
    "in addition to whatever light this spectral region might shed on the black - hole accretion - disk model for quasars , it is also a fundamental input to studies of the photoionization of the broad emission line clouds in quasars ( @xcite ) as well as the photoionization of the intergalactic medium ( @xcite ) . consequently there has been widespread interest in determining the detailed shape of the spectrum of quasars between the optical ( @xmath7 hz ) and the soft x - ray ( @xmath8 hz ) , and in particular , establishing more precisely where in the extreme uv the peak of the big blue bump is located ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the soft component was found to be significantly steeper , with @xmath15 for most of the observations .",
    "attempts to fit the soft component with various other models , including blackbody and bremsstrahlung radiation were found unacceptable ( lmp95 ) .    at ultraviolet wavelengths",
    "the first determination of the spectral index of 3c  273 ( @xcite ) gave @xmath16 over the range from the optical to lyman @xmath17 , with a broad bump around 3500  , perhaps associated with balmer continuum and fe ii line emission ( @xcite ) , that has sometimes been called the `` small blue bump '' .",
    "it was also pointed out by davidsen et al . that the spectral index must increase to @xmath18 somewhere near or above the lyman limit in order to agree with the x - ray observations .",

    "a very low resolution observation with the voyager uv spectrometer in the 9001200   band suggested the possibility of a spectral break at about 1000   ( @xcite ) , perhaps associated with the lyman edge .",
    "recent observations in the 9001200   region with orfeus imply a turnover in the spectrum of 3c  273 near the iue / orfeus transition wavelength at about 1200   ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "we report the results of observations of 3c  273 in the 9001800   region made with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) on both the astro-1 and astro-2 space shuttle missions .",
    "the astro-1 far - ultraviolet data are accompanied by contemporaneous observations at optical , ultraviolet , and soft and hard x - rays , yielding a quasi - simultaneous broad - band spectrum for this quasar extending over more than 3 decades of frequency .",

    "the astro-2 hut data are of even higher quality than those obtained on astro-1 and yield similar results , confirming that the peak of the `` big blue bump '' has now definitely been seen in 3c  273 .",
    "a comparison of these data with a composite quasar spectrum in the ultraviolet ( @xcite ) and the x - ray bands ( @xcite ) , suggests strongly that a peak in the energy spectrum of all quasars occurs near the lyman limit , and that the ionizing continuum from the lyman limit to 1 kev is a power - law of @xmath20 .",

    "absorption by interstellar hydrogen limits the observed spectra to wavelengths longer than the lyman limit at 912   ( 787   in the quasar rest frame ) .",
    "hut was used to observe 3c  273 on the astro-1 space shuttle mission in 1990 december and again on the astro-2 mission in 1995 march .",
    "the performance and calibration of the instrument are described for astro-1 by davidsen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and kruk et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and for astro-2 by kruk et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1999 ) . because substantial changes to hut s performance were made between the two flights , the results of the spectrophotometric observations may be regarded as independent measurements , effectively produced by two different instruments .",
    "the astro-1 observations were ( necessarily ) conducted primarily during daylight portions of the shuttle orbit , where there is substantial contamination by geocoronal emission lines that must be subtracted in the data reduction process .",
    "the astro-2 observations , however , were obtained mostly during night - time portions of the orbit , where the geocoronal contamination is greatly reduced .",
    "only the night portion of the astro-2 data is used .",

    "for astro-1 there are several nearly simultaneous observations that can be used to determine the broad - band spectrum of 3c  273 . also mounted on the shuttle with hut was the broad band x - ray telescope ( bbxrt ) ( @xcite ) , which observed 3c  273 in the 0.312 kev band with a resolution of about 100 ev .",
    "observations in the 0.12.4 kev band were obtained less than two weeks after the astro-1 observations ( @xcite ) , and _ ginga _ observations in the 220 kev band were also obtained during 1990 december ( @xcite ) . in the ultraviolet , iue spectra in both",
    "the short and long wavelength cameras were obtained between one and two weeks after the hut observations , and these have been extracted from the iue archive . finally , an optical spectrum of 3c  273 was kindly obtained for us by r. green on the kpno 2.1 m telescope during the astro-1 mission .",
    "all these contemporaneous measurements are listed in the observation log in table  1 .",
    "the hut observations of 3c  273 from astro-2 in 1995 march are also listed in table  1 .",
    "unfortunately , we have been unable to find any nearly simultaneous observations at other wavelengths for this epoch .",
    "the two hut observations of 3c  273 from astro-1 were summed and then processed and reduced to an absolute flux scale following our standard procedures as described by kruk et al .",
    "for astro-2 the two observations were reduced separately because of the variation of the instrument sensitivity during the mission ( @xcite ) , and the resulting spectra were then averaged , weighted by their exposure time , to yield the final spectrum presented here . as noted in table  1 , the astro-2 data had slight flux corrections of 25% applied due to light loss at the slit induced by pointing errors .",
    "the results for both missions are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the astro-1 and astro-2 spectra were obtained , reduced , and calibrated under markedly different circumstances .",
    "the astro-1 data were obtained with an instrument of relatively modest sensitivity , almost entirely during orbital day when there is substantial contamination by geocoronal emission lines that must be subtracted , and were absolutely calibrated by reference to an observation of the da white dwarf g191-b2b using a model atmosphere computed for this star by p. bergeron ( @xcite ) .",
    "the astro-2 data , on the other hand , were obtained with an instrument of much higher sensitivity , entirely during orbital night with minimal geocoronal contamination , and were absolutely calibrated by reference primarily to observations of the da white dwarf hz43 using a model atmosphere computed by d. finley using d. koester s model atmosphere codes ( @xcite ) . in spite of these major differences , the resulting spectra in fig .",
    "1 are remarkably similar .",
    "of course , 3c  273 is known to vary , so the close agreement between observations made more than four years apart is fortuitous .",
    "indeed there are clear changes observed both in the continuum and in the emission line strengths ( discussed below ) .",
    "however , both spectra show a change of continuum slope near the lyman limit in the rest frame of the quasar , which is further discussed in the next section .",
    "we first remove the airglow lines from the spectra .",
    "we use a geocoronal template that is derived from blank fields and scaled by the exposure time , and subtract it from the hut spectrum of 3c  273 .",
    "other airglow lines are fitted and removed , but significant residuals still exist in the regions around the strongest airglow lines at 1216 , 1302 and 989  .",
    "we use the iraf task _ specfit _ ( @xcite ) to fit both the astro-1 and astro-2 spectra with various components for the continuum , emission lines and absorption features .",
    "we use the same overall model for both spectra , and identical fitting windows spanning the wavelength intervals 9121194 , 12381287 , and 13191820  . for the astro-1 data",
    ", we also model the remaining airglow residuals near 989  .",
    "the intrinsic emission lines of ,  and o  vi  are modeled with dual gaussians , and other emission components are modeled with single gaussians .",
    "we constrain many components of the fit by tying related parameters together .",
    "the full - widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the weaker broad emission lines ( s  vi , c  iii , n  iii , o  i , c  ii ) are all linked , and their wavelengths are linked to that of narrow ly@xmath17 by the ratio of their laboratory wavelengths .",
    "the fwhm of broad o  vi @xmath211034 is linked to broad c  iv @xmath211549 .",
    "the wavelengths and fwhm of the n  v components are linked to the corresponding c  iv components .",
    "we include one unidentified weak , broad emission feature at a rest wavelength of 1074  .",
    "this is not he  ii @xmath211085 , and it is approximately at the location of the unidentified feature also seen in faint object spectrograph ( fos ) observations by laor et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .    for the absorption lines , we start by including features identified in previous , higher resolution observations ( fos : @xcite ; ghrs : @xcite ; orfeus : @xcite ) .",
    "we then add additional features as required to obtain a good fit to the hut data . as with the emission lines",
    ", we constrain many components of the fit by tying the fwhm of the lines together in groups by wavelength regions where the instrumental resolution is roughly the same .",
    "all lines are assumed to be unresolved , except for the blend of o  vi , c  ii , and o  i around 1038  , the blended si  ii lines at 1192  , and the blended c  iv doublet at 1549  .",
    "the wavelength region below 950   is heavily absorbed by the high - order lines of galactic hydrogen . to model",
    "this , we use a set of absorption profiles , each including 50 lyman - series lines , with a fixed column density of @xmath22 .",
    "the absorption lines are modeled using voigt profiles covering a range of 1020  in the doppler parameter which are then convolved with the instrument resolution , a gaussian of 3   fwhm . for our extinction correction",
    ", we adopt @xmath23 , as established by lockman & savage ( 1995 ) , and use the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) , with @xmath24 .",

    "( 1995 ) and appenzeller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    for both the astro-1 and astro-2 spectra ,",
    "we obtain our best fit using a broken power - law model for the continuum shape . to ascertain the significance of the apparent spectral break near the lyman limit , we compare fits performed using a single power - law for the continuum shape to a broken power - law .",
    "the single power - law fits are summarized in table  2 , and the broken power - law fits are summarized in table  3 . for the astro-1 data , the fits with a single power law do not produce satisfactory results .",
    "these fits are shown as smooth curves in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "note that the single power - law fit deviates significantly at wavelengths shortward of 1200  . even allowing for reddening corrections higher than the galactic value ,",
    "the fits are still poor , as shown in table  2 .",
    "the spectral break in the sub-  region is too sharp to be accounted for by reddening .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the best fit to the astro-2 spectrum is also summarized in table  8 .",
    "the most significant difference between the astro-1 and the astro-2 fits is that since the astro-2 spectrum is redder overall , its fit favors a higher mass black hole . in all other respects ,",
    "however , the astro-1 and astro-2 disk fits are similar . reflecting the nearly identical flux levels of the two observations , the mass accretion rates are comparable . both fits",
    "favor an inclination @xmath26 , and the lyman - limit optical depth in each is low . for astro-1 , @xmath27 , and",
    "@xmath28 also gives an acceptable fit ; for astro-2 , @xmath28 .",
    "thus in the context of our simple accretion disk model a lyman edge feature is not formally required to achieve an acceptable fit to our data for either astro-1 or astro-2 .",
    "however , the fact that a broken power - law actually provides a better fit , and that the break is very close to the lyman limit , hints that there probably is an effect associated with an opacity change at the lyman limit .",
    "we suggest that future more sophisticated disk models should endeavor to match this feature .",
    "7 shows the best - fit accretion disk spectrum in comparison to the hut astro-1 data and longer - wavelength points . here one can see that the rather smooth disk model does not fully accommodate the sharp spectral break at @xmath01000  . in the near - uv range",
    "the accretion disk continuum falls below the data largely due to balmer continuum and fe  ii line emission that is not included in our model . at longer wavelengths",
    ", the accretion disk falls below the data even more as we have not included any emission components ( either a power law or dust emission ) that are mainly responsible for the near - ir continuum .",
    "8 again shows the best fit over the whole frequency range from the hard x - ray to 7000   in the visible .",
    "the comptonized tail of the accretion disk spectrum provides an excellent match to the soft x - ray excess present in the and the bbxrt data .    to 4.35 in to 14pt to 14pt    several aspects of our accretion disk fits illustrate the shortcomings of our simple model .",
    "our best - fit inclinations of @xmath29 are a bit high given the superluminal jet in 3c  273 that suggests the disk normal should be directed close to our line of sight .",
    "however , inclinations in superluminal sources can be as high as @xmath30 , and this provides an acceptable fit for our astro-2 observations .",
    "an inclination of @xmath31 is excluded at high confidence in both data sets ( @xmath32 for the astro-1 data ) .",
    "also , as mentioned earlier , the inclination is determined mostly by the wavelength of the spectral break .",
    "a kerr disk would produce bluer breaks that are more smeared out at much lower inclination than in a schwarzschild disk ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "both the astro-1 and astro-2 fits have accretion rates that exceed the thin - disk limit of @xmath33 for a schwarzschild metric . for the astro-1 fit , @xmath34 ; for astro-2 , @xmath35 .",
    "a kerr metric would also alleviate this problem : the limit for a thin disk in this metric is higher , and , at the lower inclinations it would require , the accretion rate would also be lower .    finally ,",
    "while the astro-1 and astro-2 fits have similar mass accretion rates , their best - fit black hole masses differ by nearly a factor of two .",
    "this illustrates a fundamental difficulty of simple steady - state accretion disk models in dealing with variability : it occurs on time scales more rapid than the viscous time scale that governs the applicability of steady - state models . in a steady - state model for a given object ,",
    "the only variable that can vary freely is the mass accretion rate .",
    "therefore , one should observe correlated changes in flux and color , with brighter states exhibiting bluer disk spectra",
    ". however , the astro-1 and astro-2 data are nearly identical in flux , but they have significantly different colors . without a good model for accommodating variability in disk models , one can see that factors of several uncertainty in the actual physical parameters are easily present in our results .",
    "it is reassuring to note , however , that our values for the black hole mass based on accretion disk models ( @xmath36 ) bracket the independent value of @xmath37 obtained by laor ( 1998 ) using reverberation - mapping data .",
    "we conclude that our accretion disk models of the astro-1 and astro-2 spectra provide an overall qualitative physical characterization of the 3c  273 spectrum .",
    "while the models have quantitative shortcomings , they provide an empirical guide for potentially more sophisticated models .",
    "the most important aspects of our simple description in terms of blackbody emission and comptonization are that it ( 1 ) accounts for the peak of the ultraviolet spectrum , ( 2 ) produces a spectral break in the far - uv , and ( 3 ) has a hard power - law tail that extends to the soft - x - ray band and matches the observed soft - x - ray spectrum .",
    "we have presented absolutely - calibrated ultraviolet spectrophotometry over the 9001800   range for the quasar 3c  273 , obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope on the astro-1 mission in december 1990 and on the astro-2 mission in march 1995 . in both observations",
    "the continuum displays a change of slope near the lyman limit in the quasar rest frame . at longer uv wavelengths",
    "the continuum is well - represented by a power - law of @xmath38 .",
    "shortward of the lyman limit , however , the continuum slope has @xmath39 , where the uncertainty includes our uncertainty about @xmath40 at the level of @xmath41 .    the energy distribution per logarithmic frequency interval @xmath42 therefore has a peak close to the quasar lyman limit . the short wavelength extreme uv power - law extrapolates very well to match the soft x - ray spectrum of 3c  273 obtained nearly simultaneously in the case of astro-1 with bbxrt and",
    "the soft x - ray data themselves give @xmath43 ( lmp95 ) , so the combined uv and x - ray data suggest @xmath44 . while some models for the photoionizing extreme ultraviolet radiation from quasars have a peak",
    " the so - called `` big blue bump ''  at a wavelength much shorter than the lyman limit at 912   with a peak flux much higher than what is actually observed at both longer and shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we find that in 3c  273 the peak of the big blue bump occurs very close to the lyman limit .",
    "the photoionizing flux from 3c  273 is given by @xmath45 extending from the lyman limit to 1 kev , although there is still a gap in the data covering one decade of frequency in the extreme ultraviolet .",
    "analysis of composite quasar spectra constructed in the ultraviolet ( @xcite ) and the x - ray ( @xcite ) bands leads to the same result .",
    "the similarity between the spectrum of a single object such as 3c  273 and these composites lends physical credence to their applicability .",
    "it therefore appears to be true of quasars in general that the peak of the continuum energy distribution occurs near the lyman limit , and that the ionizing continuum is well - represented by a power - law of energy index @xmath46 extending to about 1 kev , where a separate hard x - ray component begins to dominate for higher energies .",
    "the `` extreme ultraviolet gap '' in the composite quasar spectrum is now only half a decade in frequency , however .",
    "this can be reduced somewhat further by extending the work of zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to include more observations of high redshift quasars in the far ultraviolet band .",
    "the general shape of the optical , ultraviolet , and soft x - ray spectrum of 3c  273 is consistent with that of an optically thick accretion disk around a massive black hole , which is itself surrounded by a hot medium that modifies the emergent spectrum through the inverse compton effect , as suggested by czerny & zbyszewska ( 1991 ) , lee et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and lee ( 1995 ) . in our model",
    "the spectral break is due to the thermal peak of the accretion disk spectral energy distribution with a minor contribution from lyman edge absorption .",
    "both features are broadened and blurred by comptonization in a surrounding hot medium , perhaps a corona or wind emanating from the disk .",
    "comptonization of the thermal photons from the disk also produces the power - law tail extending to the soft x - ray region ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our simple model is unable to fully account for the sharpness of the spectral break , however , and we suggest that a more sophisticated treatment of the lyman - edge region may eventually provide a better match to these data .    assuming a schwarzschild black hole with an inclination of 60 degrees , the uv spectrum is fit with a black hole mass @xmath47 with an accretion rate @xmath48 .",
    "superposed on the disk spectrum is an empirically determined lyman edge with @xmath27 .",
    "the hot corona or wind is required to have a compton parameter @xmath4 , which is obtained , for example , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 k. a temperature of this order appears plausible for a corona where compton cooling balances compton heating by the hard x - ray flux in 3c  273 .",
    "these results are quite similar to those we found previously by fitting similar models to a composite quasar spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "there we found , assuming a typical inclination of 30 degrees , a black hole mass @xmath51 and an accretion rate @xmath52 . while the best - fit parameters would change somewhat in the more realistic case of a rotating ( kerr ) black hole ( which we have not calculated ) , we believe these results provide strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis that quasars are powered by accretion onto massive black holes .",

    "<S> we present absolutely calibrated far - ultraviolet spectrophotometry of the quasar 3c  273 covering the 9001800   range . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath0 3   resolution spectra were obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope during the astro-1 mission in december 1990 and during the astro-2 mission in march 1995 . both spectra exhibit a change in slope near the lyman limit in the quasar rest frame . at longer uv wavelengths , </S>",
    "<S> the continuum has a power - law index of 0.50.7 , while shortward of the lyman limit it is 1.21.7 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distribution in @xmath1 therefore peaks close to the quasar lyman limit . </S>",
    "<S> the short wavelength uv power law extrapolates well to match the soft x - ray excess seen in simultaneous observations with the broad - band x - ray telescope and nearly simultaneous rosat observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the general shape of the broad - band spectrum of 3c  273 is consistent with that of an optically thick accretion disk whose emergent spectrum has been comptonized by a hot medium . </S>",
    "<S> our uv spectrum is well described by a schwarzschild black hole of @xmath2 accreting matter at a rate of @xmath3 through a disk inclined at 60 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> superposed on the intrinsic disk spectrum is an empirically determined lyman edge of optical depth 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the comptonizing medium has a compton parameter @xmath4 , obtained with an optical depth to electron scattering of unity and a temperature of @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> this overall shape is the same as that found by zheng et al . and laor et al . </S>",
    "<S> in their uv and x - ray composite spectra for quasars , giving physical validity to the composite spectrum approach . when combined with those results , we find that the generic ionizing continuum shape for quasars is a power law of energy index 1.72.2 , extending from the lyman limit to @xmath01 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the observational gap in the extreme ultraviolet for these combined data describing the quasar continuum shape is now only half a decade in frequency . </S>"
