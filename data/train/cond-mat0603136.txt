    "the shape of the free surface of a ferrofluid in a static magnetic field is one of the prominent examples for a non - trivial interplay between magnetic and hydrodynamic degrees of freedom in ferrohydrodynamics : on the one hand the magnetic stresses contribute to the force balance determining the surface profile whereas on the other hand the local magnetic field depends on this profile due to the magnetic boundary conditions at the surface of the magnetically permeable material @xcite .",
    "a particularily popular setup is the conical meniscus of a ferrofluid surrounding a vertical current - conducting wire @xcite , see fig .",
    "1 . neglecting surface tension the conical shape can be determined analytically from the balance between gravitational and magnetic force @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we investigate theoretically the influence of surface tension on the shape of the conical meniscus .",
    "although surface tension is known to modify free surface profiles in ferrohydrodynamics and its influence has been studied , e.g. , for small gaps @xcite and capillaries @xcite to our knowledge no systematic investigation has been done so far for the conical meniscus problem . clearly , surface tension is present in all experiments in ferrohydrodynamics and a full understanding of its impact on a basic experiment in the field is hence desirable .    as expected no analytical expression for the free surface profile can be derived when surface tension is included .",
    "the numerical determination can be reduced to a singular boundary value problem for an ordinary differential equation which is , however , not completely straightforward to solve . still , using an appropriate transformation ,",
    "accurate solutions can be obtained .",
    "the numerical effort is much smaller than in alternative procedures such as finite difference , galerkin , or collocation methods which is for example used from commercial software like ansys or comsol multiphysics @xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we collect the basic equations describing the system .",
    "section iii contains the analysis of a somewhat idealized situation . in section",
    "iv we discuss the modification of the results if the idealizations of section iii are removed .",
    "finally section v provides some conclusions .",
    "the setup to be investigated is sketched in fig .  1 . an infinitely long , straight wire of radius @xmath1 oriented along the @xmath2-axis of a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath3 carries an electric current @xmath4 .",
    "the wire is surrounded by two superimposed liquids .",
    "the lower one with density @xmath5 is a ferrofluid with a given magnetization law @xmath6 .",
    "the upper one has density @xmath7 and is a non - magnetic fluid .",
    "the interface between the two fluids is characterized by an interface tension @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath9 there is no magnetic field and the flat interface between the two fluids is taken as the @xmath10plane of the coordinate system . for @xmath11",
    "a magnetic field @xmath12 builds up which induces a force density in the lower fluid .",
    "this gives rise to an axis - symmetric conical interface parametrized by a function @xmath0 the determination of which is the central aim .",
    "note that the magnetic field ( [ h(r ) ] ) is everywhere tangential to the surface and is therefore independent of the detailed shape of the surface which makes the analysis of this case particularily transparent .     of the ferrofluid is axis - symmetric .",
    ", width=321 ]    one way to determine @xmath0 is by minimizing the total energy @xmath13 of the system .",
    "it is convenient then to use the energy of the flat interface configuration as reference state and hence to minimize the energy difference between states with a non - trivial @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently one may start with the ferrohydrodynamic bernoulli equation @xcite .",
    "the total energy difference @xmath13 is the sum of three parts , the gravitational , the surface , and the magnetic energy , @xmath15 the different parts are given , respectively , by @xmath16 and @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 denotes that part of the volume occupied by the ferrofluid for which @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the area of the interface between the two fluids and @xmath21 is the permeability of free space .",
    "note that in the last equality of ( [ e_m ] ) we have assumed that the magnetization @xmath22 and the magnetic field @xmath23 are parallel as is the case in ferrofluids .",
    "note also that @xmath24 is given by ( [ h(r ) ] ) .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation @xmath25 corresponding to the minimization of @xmath26 $ ] is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the desired interface profile @xmath0 . for a unique solution this equation has to be complemented by appropriate boundary conditions",
    ". these are @xmath27 and @xmath28 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "the second boundary condition results from the young equation @xcite @xmath30 for the contact angle @xmath31 of the fluids at the wire and the fact that @xmath32 ( cf . fig",
    "we first analyse a somewhat simplified version of the boundary value problem derived in the last section .",
    "the simplifications are the following .",
    "we assume that the non - magnetic fluid is absent , @xmath33 , that the magnetization law of the ferrofluid is linear , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the magnetic susceptibility , and that the diameter of the wire is negligible , @xmath36 .",
    "since the magnetic field @xmath24 diverges for @xmath37 so does the magnetic force density . in order to get a stable interface profile",
    "the magnetic force has to be counterbalanced by gravitation and surface tension which is possible only if @xmath38 this equation replaces the boundary condition ( [ boundaryr ] ) in the present case .",
    "consequently @xmath39 and @xmath40 are irrelevant and only @xmath8 remains which will be denoted simply by @xmath41 in the present section .",
    "using the simplifying assumptions we find for the magnetic energy ( [ e_m ] ) the expression @xmath42 which allows to explicitly perform the variation in eq.([eleq ] ) . as a result",
    "we get the following differential equation for @xmath0 @xmath43 it is convenient to introduce dimensionless quantities by measuring both @xmath29 and @xmath44 in units of @xmath45{\\frac{\\mu_0\\chi i^2}{8 \\pi^2 g \\varrho_1}}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 in units of @xmath46 .",
    "( [ euler ] ) then acquires the form @xmath47 this equation is easily solved for @xmath48 yielding the well - known hyperbola @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "a perturbative solution for @xmath50 by expanding @xmath0 in powers of @xmath41 was found to yield satisfactory results only for values of @xmath41 much smaller than those relevant in experiments .",
    "we therefore turned to a numerical solution .",
    "( [ dimlesseuler ] ) together with the boundary conditions ( [ boundaryinf ] ) and ( [ bc3 ] ) represents a singular boundary value problem of second kind ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main problem that makes a straightforward numerical solution inexpedient are the infinite intervals for @xmath29 and @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore transform both quantities according to ( cf . also fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath51 and describe the interface profile by @xmath52 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ boundaryinf ] ) and ( [ bc3 ] ) then transform into @xmath53 respectively which are much more convenient for the subsequent numerical solution . substituting the derivatives in ( [ dimlesseuler ] ) according to @xmath54 we find as differential equation for @xmath55    @xmath56    rewriting this equation in the form @xmath57 the boundary value problem ( [ euler2 ] ) , ( [ boundary2 ] ) can now easily be solved numerically using , e.  g. , the nonlinear finite - difference method described in @xcite . as initial",
    "guess for the solution which is needed in this procedure the transformation of the analytical solution @xmath58 for @xmath48 given by @xmath59{\\tan(\\varphi)}$ ] may be used .",
    "fig.[figrequal0 ] shows the resulting interface profile for parameter values corresponding to the ferrofluid emg909 of ferrotec @xcite . for comparison the shape for @xmath48 is also shown .",
    "it is clearly seen that the free surface profile is markedly modified by the influence of the surface tension .",
    "as expected the inclusion of surface tension makes the profile narrower since an additional force pointing radially inward builds up .     as determined numerically for @xmath36 and @xmath60a for the ferrofluid emg909 with parameters @xmath61kgm@xmath62 , @xmath63nm@xmath64 , and @xmath65 ( full line ) .",
    "also shown is the result for @xmath48 and otherwise identical parameters ( dashed line ) .",
    "( b ) same profiles as in ( a ) in terms of the transformed function @xmath55.,width=321 ]",
    "the above solution of the idealized problem forms a convenient starting point for the discussion of the influence of those feature in the original setup that were neglected in the previous section .",
    "a simple modification is the case in which the ferrofluid is superimposed by a non - magnetic liquid .",
    "then the density @xmath5 has to substituted by the density difference @xmath66 and the surface tension @xmath41 is to be replaced by the interface tension @xmath8 . the gravitational contribution to the total energy",
    "gets reduced and consequently larger displacements from the flat interface are to be expected .",
    "the situation can be analyzed quantitatively without further effort by mapping it to the case analyzed in the previous section .",
    "in fact the interface profile is again determined by eq .",
    "( [ dimlesseuler ] ) with only the dimensionless units and the value of @xmath41 being modified . as an explicit example we show in fig.[figcorrections](a ) how the interface profile of fig .",
    "[ figrequal0 ] gets modified for @xmath67kgm@xmath62 and @xmath68 .",
    "deviations form the linear magnetization law which become relevant in particular for small values of @xmath29 where the magnetic field gets strong can also be dealt with .",
    "an improved approximation is provided by the langevin relation @xcite , @xmath69 with the saturation magnetization of the fluid @xmath70 , the magnetic moment @xmath71 of a single ferromagnetic particle , the boltzmann - constant @xmath72 and the temperature @xmath73 .",
    "the zero - field susceptibility is then given by @xmath74 .",
    "the density of the magnetic energy can again be determined analytically @xmath75 this expression gives rise to a somewhat more complicated equation for @xmath0 , however , the overall procedure of section iii remains valid .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcorrections](a ) the modification of the result for linear magnetization law is usually small in accordance with the fact that the fraction of the ferrofluid volume for which the field is large is rather small .    finally , to elucidate the influence of a non - zero radius of the wire we consider the problem for @xmath76 but with @xmath33 and a linear magnetization law .",
    "the main qualitative difference is that instead of ( [ bc3 ] ) we have to use ( [ boundaryr ] ) as boundary condition for small @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that @xmath0 is not singular at the lower boundary .",
    "hence already the simple transformation @xmath77 is sufficient to get a numerically tractable boundary value problem for the function @xmath78 . as initial",
    "guess a linear dependence @xmath79 may be used .",
    "note that @xmath80 fixes the value of @xmath0 at @xmath81 whereas the boundary condition ( [ boundaryr ] ) involves the derivative @xmath82 at @xmath81 .",
    "therefore @xmath80 or equivalently @xmath83 has to be modified until the required value for @xmath84 is obtained .",
    "this procedure leads to a monotonic relation between the prescribed contact angle @xmath31 and @xmath83 , cf .",
    "[ figcorrections](c ) . with the help this value for @xmath83 the complete surface profile @xmath0",
    "can then be determined .",
    "[ figcorrections](b ) shows a collection of surface profiles with different @xmath83 and corresoponding contact angles @xmath31 . in the limiting case @xmath85 ,",
    "the surface profile is independent of the contact angle @xmath31 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figcorrections](d ) for a sequence of profiles with different values of @xmath1 and a fixed contact angle @xmath86 .",
    "in the present investigation we have determined the free surface profile of a magnetic fluid surrounding a vertical current carrying wire with special emphasis on the effects of interface and surface tension respectively .",
    "we have found that for experimentally relevant parameter values there is a strong influence of the surface tension giving rise to a more slender profile as compared to the well - studied case without surface tension @xcite .",
    "a more general magnetization law including saturation as well as the prescription of the contact angle at the wire changes the profile only in the vicinity of the wire .",
    "a superimposed non - magnetic liquid changes the overall scale of the profile due to the reduction of the gravitational energy ."
