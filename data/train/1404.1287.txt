    "in the search for an extension of topological invariants from the non - interacting to the interacting case , the green s function has proved to be the fundamental tool  @xcite . as shown in refs .",
    "the dressed one - particle green s function at zero frequency contains all the topological information that is required to calculate topological invariants : the inverse of the green s function at zero frequency defines a fictitious noninteracting topological hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 and its eigenvectors @xmath7 are the quantities to be used to compute the topological invariants for the interacting system .",
    "here @xmath8 , @xmath9 are band and spin indices respectively ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the latter is a good quantum number if as in the model we study below the spin orbit interaction only involves the @xmath11 component of the spin .",
    "hence , we can take the time - reversal operator to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 acts on the spin indices , @xmath14 denotes complex conjugation and @xmath15 is the identity for the sublattice indices .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 is thus a block - diagonal matrix , and is antisymmetric at time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) @xmath17 defined by the condition that @xmath18 with @xmath19 a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the generalized @xmath1 topological invariant can thus be defined @xcite as the exponent @xmath20 in the expression    @xmath21}}{{\\rm pf } [ w(\\gamma_i)]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and used to classify trivial insulators ( @xmath22 , mod 2 ) from topological qsh insulators ( @xmath23 , mod 2 ) . in the presence of inversion symmetry",
    "this definition is even simpler , involving just the parity eigenvalues @xmath24 of the occupied bands at @xmath17 for any of the two spin sectors @xmath25    the definition of @xmath1 for an interacting system is thus formally identical to the non - interacting case , involving in both cases the eigenstates of a single particle hamiltonian ; in the presence of e - e interaction the difficult task remains the calculation of the topological hamiltonian in terms of the interacting green s function . in the next section",
    "we will describe how this can be done within the cpt paradigm .",
    "we are interested in the kane - mele - hubbard model for a 2d honeycomb lattice @xmath26 the hopping term @xmath27 includes both the first - neighbor spin - independent hopping and the haldane - kane - mele second - neighbor spin - orbit coupling  @xcite given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are unit vectors along the two bonds that connect site @xmath31 with site @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 run over the @xmath34 atomic positions within the unit cell ( cluster ) and @xmath35 refer to lattice vectors identifying the unit cells of the lattice .",
    "the on - site e - e repulsion is described by the @xmath36-hubbard term .    in order to solve the eigenvalue problem  , in strict analogy with what is done in any standard tight - binding scheme for non - interacting hamiltonians , a bloch basis expression of the topological hamiltonian , namely of the dressed green s function and of its inverse ,",
    "is required @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 the lattice vectors ( l @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 the atomic positions inside the unit cell .",
    "( these relations hold in any spin sector and we have therefore intentionally omitted the spin index ) .    in the following",
    "we will adopt a many body technique to calculate the one - particle dressed green s function based on the cpt  @xcite .",
    "this method shares with other quantum cluster formalisms the basic idea of approximating the effects of correlations in the infinite lattice with those on a finite - size cluster .",
    "different quantum cluster approaches differ for the strategy adopted to embed the cluster in the continuum and to express the lattice green s function or the corresponding self - energy in terms of the cluster one . the common starting point is the choice of the @xmath43-site cluster used to _ tile _ the extended lattice .    in cpt the green s function ( [ gij ] ) for the extended lattice is calculated by solving the equation @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the cluster green s function in the local basis obtained by exact diagonalization of the interacting hamiltonian for the finite cluster ; we separately solve the problem for n , n-1 and n+1 electrons and express the cluster green s function in the lehmann representation at real frequencies . the matrix @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hopping term between site @xmath49 and @xmath50 belonging to different clusters .",
    "is solved by a @xmath51 matrix inversion at each @xmath4 and @xmath52 .",
    "a second @xmath51 matrix inversion is needed to obtain the topological hamiltonian according to eq .  .",
    "the diagonalization of the topological hamiltonian is then required to obtain the eigenvectors to be used for the calculation of @xmath1 according to  .",
    "it is worth recalling that the eigenvalues of @xmath53 in principle have nothing to do with the quasi - particle excitation energies : only the topological information is encoded in @xmath54 , but the full green s function is needed to calculate quasi - particle spectral functions @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath8 the band index and @xmath57 the eigenstate coefficients obtained by the single - particle band calculation.@xcite in the next section , analyzing in the detail all the information that can be deduced from the explicit calculation of the interacting green s function , we will also be able to investigate more closely the relations between the eigenstates of the topological hamiltonian and the quasi - particle energies .",
    "we have used the cpt formalism to calculate the dressed green s function of the kane - mele - hubbard model spanning a whole set of spin - orbit couplings @xmath58 and @xmath36 parameters . for the 2d honeycomb lattice the 6-site cluster ( fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ( a ) ) commonly used in quantum cluster calculations  @xcite has been adopted . in order to check the role of cluster size and geometry we have also considered the 8-site cluster of fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ( b ) .",
    "both clusters represent a _ tiling _ for the honeycomb lattice but with very different cluster symmetries .",
    "obviously this has no influence in the non - interacting case where either the  natural \" 2-site unit cell or any larger unit cell ( 4 , 6 , 8 sites etc . )",
    "produce the same band structure .",
    "this is no more so if the e - e interaction is switched on : in any quantum cluster approach where the extended system is described as a periodic repetition of correlated units , the translation periodicity is only partially restored ( it is preserved only at the superlattice level ) .",
    "this inevitably affects the quasi - particle band structure and for the 8-site tiling gives rise to a wrong @xmath4-dispersion .",
    "this appears quite clearly by comparing spectral functions ( cfr .",
    "eq .  ) obtained with 6-site and 8-site tilings at @xmath4-points along the border of the 2d brillouine zone .",
    "in particular , for the 6-site tiling the quasi - particle energies display the correct symmetry , and energies at any @xmath4-point and its rotated counterpart@xmath59 and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 a point group rotation  coincide ( see fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , ( c ) ) .",
    "this well - known basic rule is violated for the 8-site tiling and the quasi - particle energies at @xmath14 , @xmath62 do not coincide with the values at @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see fig . 2 ( b ) , ( d ) ) . indeed the gap closes down around @xmath63 and @xmath64 but not at @xmath14 and @xmath62 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 8-site tiling has a preferred direction so that the dispersions along @xmath65 and @xmath66 are different .",
    "the dependence on the cluster s size and symmetry of the quasiparticle band dispersion in the kane - mele - hubbard model is shown here for the first time and appears to be crucial in order to identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the results : any band structure of a non - interacting system violating the point group symmetries should be disregarded as wrong and unphysical ; the same should be done for interacting systems since e - e repulsion does not affect the lattice point group symmetry . for this reason",
    "the semimetal behaviour for @xmath67 and @xmath68 that we find for the 8-site tiling in agreement with refs . should be considered an artifact due to the wrong cluster symmetry and not to be used to infer any real behaviour of the model system .",
    "only clusters that preserve the point group symmetries of the lattice should be used  @xcite and this criterion restricts the choice for the 2d honeycomb lattice to the 6-site cluster .  .",
    "these considerations are quite general and quasi - particle states , topological invariants and phase diagrams obtained by quantum cluster approaches using tilings with the wrong symmetry ( 2- , 4- , 8-site clusters ) @xcite are for this reason not reliable .",

    "the key quantity is the dressed green s function expressed in a bloch basis ( eqs .   and  ) and the corresponding topological hamiltonian @xmath72 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem associated to @xmath53 a @xmath73 matrix diagonalization at each @xmath4-point is equivalent to a standard single particle tight - binding calculation for a unit cell containing 6 atomic sites , giving rise to 6 topological bands .",

    "this is confirmed by earlier studies of quantum phase transitions in interacting topological insulators , e.g.  . ]",
    "few comments are in order : since we are monitoring the topological phase transition by the @xmath1 invariant , we are implicitly assuming both time reversal and parity invariance and an adiabatic connection between qsh and tti phase to persist in all regimes .",
    "anti - ferromagnetism that breaks both time - reversal and sublattice inversion symmetry is therefore excluded and we are assuming the system to remain non - magnetic at any @xmath36 . in this sense",
    "the value of @xmath1 can be considered an indicator of the topological properties of the system of interest only for a parameter range that excludes antiferromagnetism .",
    "the behavior for @xmath58 close to zero is worth noticing . according to our cpt calculation ,",
    "at low @xmath58 the qsh regime does not survive the switching on of e - e interaction : a value @xmath77 is enough to destroy the semi - metallic behavior at @xmath67 ; see fig .  [ gap ] .",
    "this is at variance with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results  @xcite that at @xmath67 identify a semimetallic behavior up to @xmath78 .",
    "it has been recently shown  @xcite that the existence at @xmath67 of an excitation gap down to @xmath77 is characteristic of all quantum cluster schemes with the only exception of dca .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned violation of translational symmetry in quantum cluster methods such as cpt , vca and cdmft , regardless of the scheme being variational or not , and independent on the details of the specific implementations ( different impurity solvers , different temperatures ) .",
    "we stress here again that the semimetal behaviour that is found for the kane - mele - hubbard model by quantum cluster approaches such as cdmft  @xcite and vca  @xcite is actually an artifact due to the choice of clusters with wrong symmetry . the only quantum cluster approach that is able to reproduce a semimetal behaviour at finite @xmath36 is dca .",
    "dca preserves translation symmetry and has been shown to describe better the small @xmath36 regime ; it becomes however less accurate at large @xmath36 values where it overemphasizes the semimetallic behavior of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "@xcite in this sense dca and the other quantum cluster approaches can be considered as complementary and it would be interesting to compare their results also in terms of parity invariants .    by calculating spectral functions in the same parameter range",
    "we observe that at the transition points the single particle excitation gap @xmath79 , namely the minimum energy separation between hole and particle excitations , closes down .",
    "the possibility for e - e interaction to induce a metallic behavior in a band insulator has been recently analysed by dmft @xcite and qmc calculations @xcite ; here we observe that , in agreement with previous results @xcite , the same effect occurs in the honeycomb lattice made semiconducting by intrinsic spin - orbit interaction .",
    "[ gap ] shows the behavior of @xmath79 at different values of @xmath80 as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "[ spectral ] ( a - c ) shows as an example the quasi - particle band structure obtained for @xmath71 and for @xmath82 ( qsh regime ) , @xmath83 ( transition point from qsh to tti , the gap closes down ) and @xmath84 ( tti regime ) .",
    "( color online ) @xmath74 phase diagram of the half filled kane - mele - hubbard model .",
    "the two regimes , qsh and tti correspond to different values of the @xmath1 invariant ( @xmath76 and @xmath75 respectively ) .",
    "open dots correspond to the parameter values where the calculation has been done , the continuous line is a guide for the eye.,width=330 ]    other effects are due to the e - e correlation , namely a band width reduction and the appearance of satellite structures below ( above ) valence ( conduction ) band .",

    "satellite structures appear below and above the valence and conduction band respectively and the band width is reduced , an effect that is more evident for larger @xmath36.,width=330 ]    we may then conclude , in agreement with qmc calculations @xcite , that a change in the @xmath1 invariant is associated to the closure of both the single - particle excitation gap and of the energy separation between filled and empty states of @xmath53 : in strict analogy with the non - interacting case , a change of topological regime of the interacting systems is associated to a gap closure followed by a gap inversion in the fictitious band structure associated to @xmath53 .      according to the bulk - boundary correspondence ,",
    "1d non - interacting systems should exhibit gapless edge states once the 2d system enters the qsh regime . in the presence of e - e interaction",
    "this may not be true and a gap may open in edge states before the time - reversal z2 invariant switches off  @xcite .",
