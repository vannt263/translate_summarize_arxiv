    "there is now much evidence for vertically extended layers of gas in spiral galaxies that are most likely produced by a star - formation - driven flow from the disk .",
    "such layers are seen in diffuse ionized gas ( dig ; e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , 21-cm emission ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; boomsma , this volume ) , and x - ray emission ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as radio continuum emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dust absorption ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , among other tracers . studies of the dig layers strongly suggest that their brightness and vertical extent depend on the level of underlying star formation in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that while some gas may be infalling onto galaxy disks for the first time , the bulk of what we have observed so far in these tracers is more likely the result of a disk - halo flow .    while significant amounts of gas may typically participate in such flows , little is known about whether the flows cause significant radial redistribution of gas in the disk .",
    "this will depend on the shape of the galactic potential and the pressures and drag forces experienced by the halo gas .",
    "one way of attacking this question is to understand how gaseous halos rotate relative to disks .",
    "information has begun to emerge on this question through observations of atomic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* boomsma , fraternali , osterloo , matthews , this volume ) and ionized @xcite gas , and this has led to the first models of disk - halo cycling in which the flow is treated in purely hydrostatic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ciotti , this volume ) and ballistic @xcite limits . in this paper",
    ", we present the observational data on dig halo rotation and summarize one attempt to explain the kinematics in term of a purely ballistic flow .",
    "an accompanying paper in this volume by heald et al . describes two - dimensional kinematic data on ngc 5775 .",
    "evidence for lagging dig halos in ngc 891 and ngc 5775 has been presented by @xcite and @xcite . a long - slit spectrum oriented perpendicular to the plane of ngc 891 , centered at 100  from the nucleus ( 5 kpc at the assumed distance of 9.5 mpc ) on the approaching side of the galaxy , shows increasing heliocentric mean velocities ( figure 1 ) , consistent with a declining rotation curve ( the initial decrease within 1 kpc of the midplane is an effect of dust absorption ) .",
    "the change in observed velocity is some 2030 km s@xmath0 from 1 to 4 kpc off the plane .",
    "a lag is also seen in hi , but the falloff is significantly steeper at this location ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fraternali , this volume ) .",
    "a more dramatic example is ngc 5775 .",
    "this is an interacting galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a very bright and extended dig halo , although more concentrated into large shell , filamentary and patchy structures compared to the halo of ngc 891 ( also in hi ; see * ? ? ?",
    "at some level , the halo kinematics may be modified by the interaction .",
    "mean heliocentric velocities of dig for two long - slits ( slit 1 on the approaching side and slit 2 on the receding side ) are shown in figure 2 .",
    "forbidden - line velocities are shown rather than h@xmath1 velocities because faint emission from the latter is confused by imperfect sky - line subtraction .",
    "velocities are measurable up to about 12 kpc from the plane in slit 1 .",
    "the trend for both slits is consistent with a lagging halo , with velocities approaching or reaching @xmath2 at the largest heights .",
    "further long - slit data by @xcite , near the location of slit 2 , show a similar trend .",
    "assuming that the extraplanar gas in these galaxies is a result of disk - halo circulation , what can the lags tell us about the nature of the flow ?",
    "the discoveries are new enough so that models of the circulation are not yet very sophisticated . in one limit , one can consider a purely hydrostatic continuum fluid disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ciotti , this volume ) . in the other extreme",
    ", one can assume a purely ballistic flow with no pressure , tension , drag , or cloud interactions @xcite .",
    "each approach should shed light on the true nature of the flow .    in the ballistic model of @xcite ,",
    "clouds are launched from the disk with some vertical velocity chosen from a uniform , random distribution of values between zero and some maximum velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the initial location of the clouds are chosen from an exponential probability distribution in @xmath4 and a narrow gaussian distribution in @xmath5 .",
    "the potential used for most simulations is from @xcite .",
    "as the clouds rise they migrate outward in radius due to the weaker radial component of the potential they experience ; they rotate slower as a consequence of conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the most important parameter governing the extent and kinematics of the halo clouds is the ratio of @xmath3 to the circular rotation speed @xmath6 .",
    "this ratio is chosen to match the vertical scale - height of the emission for the halo in question .",
    "figure 3 , showing meriodonal plots ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 ) for clouds launched at radii of 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 kpc for @xmath3/@xmath7 , demonstrates the outward migration and reduction in azimuthal velocities of the halo clouds .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show how well the predicted mean heliocentric velocities match the data for ngc 891 and ngc 5775 .",
    "the model badly overpredicts the lag in ngc 891 but fares somewhat better for ngc 5775 , although the observed velocities near systemic can not be reproduced . in ngc 891 ,",
    "the outward migration and resultant lag is presumably mitigated by some ( magneto)hydrodynamic effect , such as a halo gas pressure increasing radially outward or a magnetic or viscous coupling to the disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ciotti , this volume ) . in ngc 5775 , with its apparently more active disk - halo flow (",
    "the emission is brighter , the gas scale - height larger , and the morphology more filamentary than in ngc 891 ) , the ballistic approximation may work somewhat better .",
    "ngc 4302 is paired with another spiral ngc 4298 , although there are no known signs of interaction .",
    "the galaxy appears extremely edge - on .",
    "the extraplanar dig is concentrated above the inner disk , as for ngc 891 , but several times fainter at comparable heights @xcite .",
    "we have observed ngc 4302 with two pointings of the sparsepak fiber - optic array @xcite on the wiyn telescope .",
    "figure 4 shows the spatial sampling of the fibers .",
    "total integration times are 380 and 410 minutes for the northern and southern pointings , respectively .",
    "the velocity resolution is 30 km s@xmath0 , and the bright lines covered include h@xmath1 , [ n@xmath8ii]@xmath9 and [ s@xmath8ii]@xmath10 .",
    "the results presented here are preliminary , and based only on mean velocities , which are indicative of , but do not accurately represent , rotation speeds .",
    "figure 5 shows velocities of the h@xmath1 and [ n@xmath8ii]@xmath11 lines as a function of height from the midplane for four representative distances , r , from the minor axis ( negative values of r correspond to the approaching side and positive values to the receding side ) .",
    "a preliminary run of the ballistic model from @xcite is also shown in each panel .",
    "the ratio @xmath3/@xmath6 is 0.8 , but model parameter space has not yet been explored . in general , the approaching side of the galaxy suggests a reasonably well - behaved lagging halo , which can be fairly matched by the ballistic model , but at heights larger than about 25  ( 2 kpc )",
    "mean velocities become very close to systemic and in many cases become greater than systemic , suggesting a disturbance or possibly counterrotation .",
    "the kinematics of the receding side are more complex , with much more scatter in the velocities ( the r=20  panel being typical ) and a lagging halo signature apparent in only a few locations , such as at r=60 \" as shown here .",
    "there is clear evidence that ionized gas halos rotate slower than the underlying disks .",
    "the falloffs in rotation speed are not generally matched by a ballistic model of disk - halo flow , indicating that pressures and/or drag forces must affect rotation significantly .",
    "the overpredicted lag in ngc 891 suggests either a halo gas pressure that increases with radius or a magnetic or viscous drag with the faster disk .",
    "the model is somewhat more successful in ngc 5775 and ngc 4302 , but can not reproduce velocities near the systemic value at heights of several kpc in the former , while the latter shows several peculiarities in its halo kinematics .",
    "however , while mean velocities give an indication of the lagging effect , they can not be used to determine with accuracy the decline of the rotation speed with height .",
    "it is therefore necessary to produce kinematic models that match the full spatial and spectral information available in two - dimensional kinematic data .",
    "we have begun this process using observations of ngc 5775 in the h@xmath1 line using the taurus imaging fabry - perot interferometer on the anglo - australian telescope ( heald et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "this is a difficult process , especially given the 86@xmath12 inclination of this galaxy .",
    "dust further complicates the analysis .",
    "we will also apply this analysis to the data on ngc 4302 described above ."
