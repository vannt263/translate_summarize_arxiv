    "many studies of globular cluster evolution have focused on internal mechanisms which drive evolution .",
    "this work has produced a clear picture in which initial stellar evolution causes significant mass loss from a nascent cluster ( e.g. chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) ; two - body relaxation leads to mass segregation ( e.g. inagaki & saslaw 1985 ) and core collapse in surviving clusters ( e.g. cohn 1980 ) ; binary heating halts collapse ( e.g. lee et al . 1991 ) ; and the cluster continuously loses mass due to the escape of stars , eventually undergoing complete evaporation ( e.g. lee & goodman 1995 ) .",
    "it is also recognized that the galaxy influences cluster evolution .",
    "the time - dependent tidal field heats clusters and tidal limitation aids in the removal of escaping stars .",
    "previous investigations have considered disk shocking , bulge shocking and tidal limitation , concluding that each will play a role , particularly in the inner galaxy ( e.g. spitzer & chevalier 1973 ; chernoff & shapiro 1987 ; aguilar , hut & ostriker 1988 ; weinberg 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , recent observational studies showing correlations of cluster properties with galactocentric position indicate the measurable influence of the galaxy ( e.g chernoff & djorgovski 1989 ; djorgovski et al 1993 ; djorgovski & meylan 1994 ) .    the principal tool used in studies of cluster evolution over the last decade - and - a - half has been direct solution of the fokker - planck equation ( cohn 1979 )",
    ". however , most of these calculations have excluded external effects .",
    "recently , using time - dependent perturbation theory to investigate disk shocking , weinberg ( 1994 ) demonstrated that resonant forcing can perturb internal stellar trajectories beyond the limit expected from adiabatic invariance .",
    "this indicates that the galaxy plays a greater role in cluster evolution than previously thought and motivates new studies of cluster evolution which combine internal and external effects .",
    "the importance of external heating requires us to re - examine the current picture of internally - driven evolution .",
    "in particular , external effects will influence the collapse rates , evaporation times and general physical properties derived in previous calculations .",
    "the present work compares this behavior with and without heating over a wide range of cluster properties to present a revised view .",
    "this study also examines the survival and disruption characteristics of clusters on a range of galactic orbits to shed light on the initial conditions of the cluster system .",
    "the results demonstrate that evolution does indeed depend strongly on position and orbit , further implying that observed cluster properties have been largely determined through dynamics .",
    "our study rests on a linear theory of external heating based on weinberg s ( 1994 ) treatment of disk shocking which we include in numerical solutions of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "nearly all previous work has emphasized impulsive shock heating due to a single passage through the disk or bulge .",
    "the work presented here describes resonant heating due to the time - varying tidal field encountered on periodic orbits of the cluster in the galaxy- an effect we refer to as _ orbit _ heating . in this context",
    ", shock heating is seen to result from the broad resonances caused by an impulsively applied external force .",
    "although our treatment of external heating can include the influence of any component of the galactic potential , here we consider only the spheroid in order to allow precise definition of the physical behavior and preliminary description of the evolutionary trends .",
    "the present study includes heating on cluster orbits in the isothermal sphere and is used to study cluster evolution from initial king model states to the point of complete evaporation on a range of orbits in the galaxy .",
    "our conclusions , therefore , place only lower limits on the overall rate of cluster evolution but are significant nonetheless .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we derive the linear theory of external heating in  [ sec : eh ] and discuss its physical interpretation in  [ sec : sumep ] . in  [",
    "sec : calc ] , the numerical implementation is described . in  [ sec : results ] we present the results of our study of cluster evolution under the combined influence of internal and external effects . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] , we discuss the implications of the results for the milky way globulars .",
    "readers concerned primarily with the effects of heating and its evolutionary consequences may skip  [ sec : eh ] without loss of continuity .",
    "the physics behind the perturbation theory discussed below can be summarized as follows .",
    "each orbit in the cluster acts like a pendulum with two - degrees of freedom ( cf . binney & tremaine 1987 , chap .",
    "3 ) . the time - dependent tidal field can drive the pendula at a discrete or continuous spectrum of frequencies depending on whether the perturbation is quasi - periodic or aperiodic , respectively . because the temporal variation discussed here is caused by the cluster s orbit in the spherical component of the galaxy ,",
    "the spectrum is discrete . for disk shocking described by weinberg ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the spectrum is continuous . in both cases ,",
    "the energy of each orbit changes as it passes through the resonance .",
    "the accumulated effect of all possible resonances on all orbits , drives the secular evolution of the equilbrium distribution function ( df ) .",
    "the expressions given below are valid for both periodic and aperiodic cases .",
    "we compute the evolution by expanding the boltzmann equation to first order and solving for the perturbed distribution function ( neglecting self - gravity ) .",
    "the first - order change phase mixes but second order energy input leads to an induced phase space flux which helps drive cluster evolution .",
    "n - body comparisons shown in appendix [ sec : compsim ] indicate that the self - gravity of the tidally - induced wake has negligible effect for cases of interest here .",
    "we use a locally inertial reference frame which is centered on the cluster and has axes fixed in space ( see appendix [ sec : hamiltonian ] for derivation ) .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is therefore completely separable , implying the existence of action - angle variables .",
    "this frame allows the internal dynamics to be defined in accordance with the standard fokker - planck technique ( e.g. cohn 1979 ) which uses an energy - space df @xmath1 and depends on the adiabatic invariance of the radial action . within this framework",
    ", we derive a version of the formalism presented by weinberg ( 1994 ) which describes heating of globular clusters on arbitrary orbits in external potentials .",
    "the linearized boltzmann equation is a linear partial differential equation in seven variables .",
    "using action - angle variables , we can separate the equation and employ standard dfs constructed according to jeans theorem ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the explicit form of the linearized boltzmann equation is    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the vector of angles , and @xmath4 are the conjugate actions .",
    "the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend on the actions alone .",
    "the small variation in galactic potential over a typical cluster size allows quadratic expansion of the tidal field ( see appendix [ sec : hamiltonian ] for details ) .",
    "we may thus define @xmath7 and expand in a fourier series in action - angle variables ( e.g. tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) .",
    "each term @xmath8 in the fourier series is the solution of the following differential equation :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and    @xmath11    the inhomogeneous equation may be solved using a green s function ( e.g. birkhoff & rota 1962 , p.39 ) to give the time - dependence for each coefficient of the perturbed df    @xmath12    where we have assumed that the perturbation begins at time @xmath13 .",
    "the rate of change in energy arising from the perturbation follows from hamilton s equations ( weinberg 1994 ) .",
    "the total phase - averaged change in energy can be written as    @xmath14    substituting for @xmath8 from equation ( [ eq : f1l ] ) yields    @xmath15    which represents the heat input due to the perturbation during an interval @xmath16 .",
    "this expression is valid for finite - duration , aperiodic perturbations such as disk passage as well as periodic perturbations which arise on regular orbits in the galaxy . in particular , weinberg s ( 1994 ) results for disk shocking are obtained from equation ( [ eq : de ] ) by substituting the tidal amplitude appropriate to the disk profile for @xmath17 and integrating over the interval @xmath18 assuming a linear trajectory .    for periodic perturbations",
    "it is more suitable to derive the asymptotic heating rate ( e.g. landau & lifschitz 1965 , p.151 ) .",
    "we first expand the tidal amplitude in a fourier series    @xmath19    and substitute into equation ( [ eq : de ] ) . taking the limit @xmath20 and assuming the onset of the perturbation at @xmath21",
    ", we obtain    @xmath22    integrating @xmath23 over inclination and angular momentum , we obtain the change in energy which defines the induced change in the distribution , given by a one - dimensional continuity equation in energy space ( appropriate to the 1d fokker - planck formulation employed below ; see appendix [ sec : fluxeq ] for derivation ) :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the phase space volume .",
    "this is called the equation of quasilinear diffusion in the plasma literature ( e.g. stix 1992 ) .",
    "the term _ quasilinear _ refers to the proportionality of the heating rate to the squared amplitudes of the linear modes .",
    "the linear modes arise from the resonant forcing of stellar orbits by a periodic perturbation .",
    "the competition between two - body relaxation and this externally induced phase space flux can strongly influence globular cluster evolution , as we will show below .",
    "below we will need the heating rate for a cluster orbiting in the isothermal sphere . for most galaxies ,",
    "the small variation in potential over a typical cluster size allows quadratic expansion of the tidal field .",
    "therefore , the perturbing hamiltonian is :    @xmath26 , \\label{eq : perpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the angular rotation speed at the orbital radius at time t and @xmath28 is the instantaneous azimuthal angle of orbit . using equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in weinberg ( 1994 ) , we can write the perturbation as a series in action - angle variables :    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    @xmath31 is the inclination of the orbital plane and @xmath32 is a rotation matrix ( e.g. tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath33 is the difference between the mean azimuthal angle @xmath34 and the azimuthal angle in the orbital plane .",
    "we substitute this expansion into equation ( [ eq : edot ] ) and average over inclination and angular momentum to derive the heating rate    @xmath35\\fsum |a_n|^2\\delta(\\ldomega - n\\omega )      \\nonumber\\\\       + \\biggl[{1\\over 30}\\delta_{l_2 0}+{1\\over 20}\\delta_{l_2 |2|}\\biggr ]          \\fsum |b_n|^2\\delta(\\ldomega - n\\omega)\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath36    @xmath37    and p is the period of the cluster orbit .    for an isotropic df , @xmath38 .",
    "we also explore the effect of anisotropy using merritt - osipkov models ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the distribution function takes the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the anisotropy increases with decreasing anisotropy radius , @xmath42 .",
    "a cluster orbiting in the galaxy feels a time - dependent tidal field . a typical orbit is periodic and introduces a periodic external force on orbits of cluster stars . as described in ",
    "[ sec : eh ] , resonant heating occurs when the periods of stellar orbit and external force coincide , leading to repeated acceleration and increase in the energy of individual orbits . integrated over many periods , the energy gained by the orbit increases linearly with time ( c.f .",
    "[ eq : res ] ) .",
    "energy absorption eventually leads to the evolution of individual orbits .",
    "( see appendix [ sec : imp ] for discussion and numerical implementation of finite duration resonances ) .",
    "this in turn drives the secular evolution of the cluster potential .",
    "orbits can either gain or lose energy to the tidal field depending on the particular resonance .",
    "for example , in disk galaxies with flat rotation curves it is well - known that the inner lindblad resonance loses energy to a perturbation while an outer lindblad resonance gains energy .",
    "however , for isotropic distribution functions with @xmath43 , the perturbation always heats the system on average though some localized regions of phase space may lose energy .",
    "non - resonant interaction has no net effect on an orbit .",
    "successive maxima in the external force tend to accelerate and decelerate the star equally , leading to asymptotic cancellation as long as the initial transients remain linear ( i.e. do not alter the intrinsic frequency of the star with an initial jolt ) . over short times ,",
    "non - resonant heating does occur because the time duration is insufficient for complete cancellation to occur .",
    "non - linear transient or _ impulsive _ heating leads to rapid change in orbital energies as a rapidly applied force ` kicks ' a star regardless of its orbital frequency .",
    "however , the standard impulse approximation , when used to describe a periodic perturbation , ignores the long - term decay of transient energy in the linear limit as well as the linear growth in energy at the resonances . for most cases of interest ,",
    "heating rates are in the linear limit , implying that external influence depends primarily on secular transfer of energy through orbital resonances .    to illustrate the behavior of transients and transient decay , figure [ fig : k5.in.3.comp ] compares the exact time - dependent energy input given by equation ( [ eq : de ] ) with the energy input defined by the asymptotic heating rate equation ( [ eq : res ] ) .",
    "transients decay rapidly at low energy and more slowly at high energy .",
    "empirically , we find that two to three galactic orbital periods are required before the asymptotic limit is effectively reached .",
    "this treatment therefore adequately describes all but the outermost halo clusters for which initial transients may still be important .",
    "the comparisons of perturbation theory with n - body simulation shown in appendix [ sec : compsim ] demonstrate the validity of the approach .",
    "the magnitude of the heating rate is determined by the cluster profile , density and orbit .",
    "the profile and density define the distribution of internal orbital frequencies and the cluster orbit defines the external forcing frequencies and amplitude . for a cluster of fixed profile and mass , the density is determined by the tidal radius .",
    "individual clusters may not be tidally limited due to initial conditions or heating - driven expansion .",
    "therefore we use the function @xmath44 to parameterize the fraction of the total cluster mass enclosed within the instantaneous pericentric inner lagrange point , @xmath45 .",
    "this function depends on the profile and the ratio of cluster mean density to the mean density required by tidal limitation .",
    "a tidally - limited cluster has limiting radius , @xmath46 , and therefore @xmath47 , while a tidally - unlimited has @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 .",
    "heating rates for a given orbit increase as @xmath44 decreases .",
    "the perturbing potential in the logarithmic sphere , equation ( [ eq : perpot ] ) , heats clusters on orbits of any eccentricity . the tide transfers energy and angular momentum to the cluster through the resonances , which unbinds stars .",
    "on circular orbits , the tidal field creates a triaxial perturbation of constant amplitude proportional to @xmath50 rotating with fixed pattern speed @xmath51 . on eccentric orbits ,",
    "conservation of center - of - mass angular momentum introduces time - dependent amplitude and rotation rate .",
    "this produces more resonances .",
    "tidal torquing can also induce a net spin .    the rate of external heating is also influenced by our choice of equilibrium phase space distributions .",
    "for example , according to jeans theorem , one can define equilibria in the rotating frame of a circular cluster orbit using the jacobi constant , @xmath52 ( e.g. heggie & ramamani 1994 ) . by transforming to the frame",
    "in which the perturbation is time - independent , we remove the resonances from the problem .",
    "we can therefore choose a bound distribution of orbits in @xmath52 using the limiting zero - velocity surface , so no stars are lost and the cluster experiences no net tidal heating , although inertial energies and angular momenta are not conserved . using @xmath1 instead of",
    "@xmath53 leads to heating in the analogous case because we can not choose orbits which are strictly bound . in any case",
    ", a real cluster can not reach true equilibrium because it is bound and therefore undergoes relaxation .",
    "in fact , as is shown below , it is typically a competition between external heating and relaxation due to strong resonances with diffused core stars that strongly influences cluster evolution .",
    "to determine the influence of external heating on cluster evolution , we conduct a series of fokker - planck calculations which begin with king model initial conditions and run through core collapse to complete evaporation .",
    "relaxation is computed using the multi - mass code of chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) which solves henon s ( 1961 ) orbit - averaged fokker - planck equation .",
    "core heating is included in the form described by lee et al ( 1991 ) with a time step that supresses stochastic core osillations .",

    "evaporation times can decrease by a factor of two in circular cases when tidal heating is included .",
    "the relative evaporation times reflect the relative strength of heating rates shown in figure [ fig : der.comp ] .",
    "heating accelerates evolution because external forcing efficiently torques and expels high - energy core stars on radial orbits , as noted by oh & lin ( 1992 ) in n - body calculations .",
    "this reduces the local relaxation time in the core , enhances relaxation rates and causes rapid evaporation .",

    "time - dependent heating on low - eccentricity orbits accelerates evolution and sharply reduces evaporation times .",
    "tidally limited clusters on high - eccentricity orbits have high internal density , leading to short evaporation times even though heating rates are negligible .",
    "bulge shocking on high - eccentricity orbits can rapidly disrupt clusters over a wide range in mass and apogalactic radius when their densities are roughly a factor of 10 below the mean density required for tidal limitation .",
    "evaporation and disruption have shaped the mass , orbit and density distribution of clusters .",
    "in particular , clusters at the peak of the luminosity function had at least @xmath124 more mass depending on orbit .",
    "evaporation on high - eccentricity orbits has decreased the velocity dispersion in the cluster kinematic distribution .",
    "secondary results are as follows :    1 .",
    "evaporation times do not strongly depend on concentration in most cases .",
    "however , heating can lead to rapid disruption in massive clusters with low concentration because of the low binding energy and long relaxation time .",
    "clusters disrupting due to heating may still show signs of mass segregation due to continued relaxation .",
    "3 .   heating accelerates evolution over a range of mass spectral index and reduces the dependence of evaporation time on different initial mass spectra .",
    "4 .   the development of anisotropy through relaxation in the core will increase evolutionary rates found in the isotropic distributions investigated here .",
