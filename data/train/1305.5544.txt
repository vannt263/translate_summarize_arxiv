    "the transiting planet gj1214b @xcite is currently the best studied super - earth . with a radius of 2.6 r@xmath1 and a mass of 6.5 m@xmath1",

    "explain the low density of gj1214b in the context of three different formation models ; two of these models result in a thick atmosphere with a low mean - molecular weight and a large scale - height , while the third scenario , that gj1214 is a water - world , predicts a small scale - height due to the large mean - molecular weight of water compared to hydrogen .",
    "models for gj1214b s atmosphere showed that in the case of a hydrogen - rich atmosphere , signatures of the atmosphere should be well within reach of current instrumentation @xcite .",
    "many observations probing the atmosphere of gj1214 have been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "although most of these observations did not show the expected features for an extended atmosphere , @xcite found an increased radius in the k - band indicative of molecular absorption , and @xcite , hereafter paper i , reported a tentative signal from rayleigh scattering towards blue wavelengths . in the case that the atmosphere of gj1214b is extended , the lack of spectral features at longer wavelengths can be explained by a low abundance of methane , as well as a cloud - layer that masks the features .",

    "on the night of may 22 , 2011 , a transit of gj1214b was observed in the g - band ( @xmath2=4996@xmath3 ) with acam @xcite at the william herschel telescope .",

    "an exposure time of 30 seconds was used , resulting in a total of 364 frames , with an average cadence of 44 seconds .",
    "the circular field of view of acam is 8 arcmin in diameter , allowing the observation of several reference stars simultaneous with the target . due to the relative faintness of gj1214 in g - band",

    "the guider resulted in a drift of 10 pixels ( 2.5  ) during the night . towards the end of the night",

    "a second transit of gj1214 was observed with the focal reducing spectrograph ( fors ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) on july 12 , 2011 in the b - high filter ( @xmath2=4543@xmath3 ) .",
    "the observations , which lasted for 2h40 m , started at 01:28ut .",

    "although fors consists of 2 detectors , only data from one detector was used , due to a systematic difference in the photometry between the detectors .",
    "the detector used has an unvignetted field of view of 7 by 4. the seeing during the observations was highly variable , varying between 1  and 3  with a median of 1.4 ",

    ", a transit of gj1214b was observed in the g - band ( @xmath2=4962@xmath3 ) with the wide field camera ( wfc ) of the isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "the observations lasted 3 hours and started at 02:35ut . during this time",
    "113 frames were obtained with an average cadence of 97 seconds and an exposure time of 60 seconds .",
    "although the camera consists of four ccds , each with a pixel scale of 0.33/pixel , only the central ccd ( ccd4 ) was used , with a field - of - view of @xmath522.7 by 11.4. the telescope was not defocused for these observations.the atmosphere was stable during the observations , and the median seeing was 1.4  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : obs_details ] ) .",
    "[ sec : dr ]        the data from all telescopes were reduced in similar ways : after bias subtraction the data were flatfielded using a flatfield created from twilight flats .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) of the fors instrument is known to introduce rotator angle dependent variations in the flatfield @xcite .",
    "therefore flatfields for the b@xmath6 filter at different rotator angles were obtained from the eso archive for the period surrounding our observations .",
    "these flatfields were combined into a single master flat .",
    "subsequently , aperture photometry was performed on gj1214 and a set of reference stars .",
    "an aperture radius of 18 , 13 and 13 pixels was used for the acam , fors and wfc observations respectively ( 4.5 , 3.75 and 4.3 arcsec ) .",
    "these apertures were chosen to minimise the noise in the respective light curves .",
    "the photometry from multiple reference stars was combined into a master reference light curve for each of the observations . for the int observations",
    "13 reference stars were used , while the limited field - of - view for the other instruments limited the number of useable reference stars to 4 and 3 for the wht and vlt respectively .",
    "although there are more stars inside the field of view , many of them are either saturated or show strong systematic effects ( for the vlt this might be due to the rotator angle dependence of the flat field ) .",
    "subsequently the light curve for gj1214 was divided by the master reference light curve and normalised .",
    "the normalised light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] .",
    "no strong systematic effects are seen in the wht and int light curves , while the vlt light curve shows a smooth gradient .",
    "we fit for this trend simultaneous with the transit depth using a markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the transit is modeled using the @xcite routines with the scaled semi - major axis and the impact parameters fixed to those from @xcite ( a / r@xmath7=14.9749 and b=0.2779 ) , the limb - darkening was also kept fixed , for the vlt observations to the values from @xcite , while for the wht & int observations limb - darkening coefficients from @xcite were used .",
    "we used the quadratic limb darkening coefficients for a star with t@xmath8=3030k and log(g)=5.0 .",
    "the time of mid - transit and the planet - to - star radius ratio are free parameters .",
    "we verified that when we include the impact parameter , semi - major axis , and limb - darkening as free parameters , we obtain consistent results .",
    "three different models were used to correct the systematic effects in the baseline : a model depending on the geometric airmass , a second - order polynomial baseline model and a third - order polynomial baseline model . for each combination of light curve and baseline model",
    "we created five separate mcmc chains of 200,000 steps for which the first 20,000 steps were discarded to remove the burn - in .",
    "subsequently these five chains were merged , after verifying that they had converged using the gelman - rubin statistic @xcite .",
    "the results of these mcmc chains are given in table  [ tab : rprs_baselines ] .",
    "the impact of red - noise was assessed using the residual permutation ( `` prayer - bead '' ) method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for each of the datasets .",
    "the 16% and 84% distribution of the fitted parameters are taken as the @xmath0 1@xmath9 confidence interval .",
    "the radius - ratios with uncertainties as determined from this analysis are given in table  [ tab : rprs_prayer_bead ] .",
    "as can be seen the uncertainties from this analysis indicate that the contribution from red - noise is small .",
    "we therefore adopt the measurements from the mcmc analysis for the rest of this work .    as an additional check on the robustness of the fit we determined",

    "[ fig : rprs ] we show for each of the three datasets the measured radius ratios for both a reference signal based on an ensemble of light curves as well as for the individual light curves .",

    "we adopt the baseline with airmass only for the wht observations , the results for the second - order polynomial for the vlt observations and the model with the third order polynomial baseline for the int observations .",

    "* ) , some ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use a different set of parameters , which could cause an offset , making a direct comparison between the measured radius - ratios more difficult .",
    "in addition , we note that gj1214 is an active star , and that the presence of starspots could bias the measurement of the radius measurements ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : starspots ] ) . since the measurements from the literature were made at different dates , and therefore different levels of stellar activity , this could influence the observed transmission spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_all ] we show the transmission spectrum of gj1214b based on our measurements and those from the literature listed above      we compared the observed wavelength dependent transmission spectrum with a set of models for three different scenarios for the nature of the atmosphere of gj1214 : an atmosphere with a small scale - height ( a `` water world '' ) , a large scale - height atmosphere without clouds and an atmosphere with clouds and a large scale - height .",
    "the models are the same as used in paper i.    we have overplotted the models on the data in figs .",
    "[ fig : spec_all ]  and  [ fig : spec_opt ] . as can be seen the model with the large scale - height and no clouds ( green dashed - dotted line ) can clearly be excluded .",
    "the water - world model ( blue , dashed - triple dotted line ) and the model with a large scale - height and a cloud layer ( red dashed line ) are both consistent with the data .",
    "assuming that all the uncertainties on the measurements are reliable , we can calculate the formal @xmath12 for each of the three models .",
    "for the water - world @xmath12=190 , for the cloudless atmosphere @xmath12=4003 and for the atmosphere with clouds @xmath12=289 , while a flat line gives @xmath12=148 . from this",
    "it follows that the current available data favour a flat transmission spectrum ( i.e. no atmosphere or a grey atmosphere ) , followed by a water dominated atmosphere . in this paper a total of 92 measurements of the radius are used .",
    "note that assigning degrees of freedom to each of these models is not very useful , since there are many different parameters that can be adjusted ( e.g. composition and temperature - pressure profile ) .",

    "we briefly discuss some physical possibilities that can create such a flat transmission spectrum .",
    "although unlikely , a flat transmission spectrum could indicate that gj1214b lacks an atmosphere with the density of the planet , which requires either a water - dominated planet or a planet with an extended envelope  @xcite .    in the case of an extended atmosphere , the presence of clouds can also result in a grey transmission spectrum .",
    "this point is mentioned by several authors in a qualitative manner ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it needs pointing out that such a cloud would have to meet specific requirements to produce a flat spectrum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "one option is that there is an optically thick cloud , which itself has a wavelength - independent extinction , at high enough altitudes to cover any gas absorption features .",
    "such a cloud can be vertically extended , as long as it is optically thick when seen in transmission .",
    "because of the wavelength - independent extinction , the altitude at which the cloud becomes optically thick will also be independent of wavelength . for cloud properties to be constant with wavelength ,",
    "the particles need to be larger in size than the wavelength range .",
    "[ fig : mie_mg2sio4 ] shows an example of the extinction cross - sections as a function of wavelength for mg@xmath14sio@xmath13 particles , which has only slowly varying optical constants along these wavelengths and is not strongly absorbing . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : mie_h2o ] shows the extinction cross - sections for the same particle size distributions for water droplets , which has a clear absorption feature around 3 micron .",
    "even for the large particles , the extinction cross - section is significantly larger there than at other wavelengths .",
    "for both the mg@xmath14sio@xmath13 and h@xmath14o the cross - sections are calculated using a mie code based on @xcite .    alternatively , if the clouds have a very sharp decrease of optical depth above the cloud tops , that could also result in a featureless transmission spectrum .",
    "if the cloud is optically thick along the slant path through the atmosphere , variations of cloud properties with wavelength are irrelevant .",
    "the cloud then still needs to be above the altitude where gas absorption is important .",
    "note that at present we can not constrain a pressure range of the cloud tops , since we do not know the gas abundances .",
    "for instance , @xcite show that atmospheric escape can be very important for gj 1214b , which will change the composition of the atmosphere .",
    "the pressure limits mentioned by @xcite are only valid for a solar composition atmosphere in chemical equilibrium .",
    "finaly , a sharp drop of gas volume mixing ratio , for instance due to condensation , photolysis or ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can make a transmission spectrum appear flatter across all wavelengths , although this is unlikely to yield a perfectly flat transmission spectrum .",
    "/r@xmath7 in the g - band as a function of stellar variability in the i - band .",
    "the corresponding spot coverage fraction , assuming a spot temperature of 2800k is indicated above .",
    "the stellar variability as measured by @xcite is @xmath51% in the the mearth bandpass , comparable to the i - band used here , and is indicated by a dashed line.,width=302 ]    in the discovery paper  @xcite noted that host - star , gj1214 , is variable with a period of tens of days , which they attribute to starspots rotating in and out of view .",
    "@xcite used more measurements from mearth , and found an average variability of 1% on a period of @xmath550 days .",
    "unocculted starspots , whether contributing to the stellar variability or not , can , as discussed in paper i ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have a significant impact on the observed transmission spectrum . the wht , int and vlt observations were taken over the span of approximately a year , and are , most - likely , at different levels of stellar variability .",
    "this could lead to systematic differences in the measured radius ratios . assuming a spot temperature of 2800k ( @xmath5200k lower than the temperature of the stellar photosphere )",
    ", the @xmath51% variability from @xcite corresponds to a bias in the radius ratio of @xmath50.001 in the g - band(see fig .",
    "[ fig : spotfrac ] ) .",
    "since we do not have contemporary measurements of the variability for all the observations , we do not correct our measurements for this effect .",
    "as noted in paper i , a background of unocculted starspots that does not contribute to the stellar activity , could also significantly alter the shape of the transmission spectrum .",
    "we have observed three transits of gj1214b at blue optical wavelengths in order to search for the signature of rayleigh scattering in its atmosphere , which should be present if its atmosphere has a low mean molecular weight and no large cloud particles .",
    "we find planet - to - star radius ratios of 0.1180@xmath00.0009 , 0.1162@xmath00.0017  and 0.1174@xmath00.0017  in the g@xmath15- , b@xmath6- and g@xmath16-bands respectively , and we do not confirm the potential 2@xmath9 signal of rayleigh scattering presented in paper i. combining these measurements with values from the literature , and comparing the full wavelength dependent transmission spectrum with atmospheric models we find that a model with a large scale height and no cloud layer is incompatible with the available data .",
    "both a model with a large scale height and a cloud layer and a model for an atmosphere with a small scale - height are a better fit to the data with the water model favoured over the model for an extended atmosphere with clouds .",
    "we therefore conclude that , based on the currently available data , gj1214b probably has an atmosphere with a small scale - height , although it should be noted that a featureless transmission spectrum provides the lowest @xmath12 .",
