    "<S> conversely , trapped ions can also get collisionally heated by the cold atoms , making the resulting equilibrium between ions and atoms intriguing . here </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate , rubidium ions ( rb@xmath1 ) cool in contact with magneto - optically trapped ( mot ) rb atoms , contrary to the general expectation of ion heating for equal ion and atom masses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling mechanism is explained theoretically and substantiated with numerical simulations . </S>",

    "<S> this letter investigates energy transfer from trapped @xmath2rb@xmath1 ions to laser cooled @xmath2rb atoms in a mot , which have equal masses , resulting in ion cooling . since rb@xmath1 ions have a closed shell electron configuration they are not amenable to direct laser cooling . in addition , trapped ions heat  @xcite due to factors such as trap imperfections , background gas collisions and radiofrequency ( rf ) heating due to ion@xmath0ion repulsion . in the present experiment , collisions with cold atoms </S>",
    "<S> is the only available cooling channel for rb@xmath1 ions . to explain the collisional ion cooling we first discuss the experimental arrangement , then furnish the theoretical argument for efficient cooling of ions by mot atoms , followed by computational results which expand the scope of the binary ion@xmath0atom collision . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of ion cooling and trapped ion number equilibrium by the mot atoms is then presented and discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> atom combined trap is constructed , so as to coincide the mot center with the minimum of the ion trap secular potential , at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the mot is formed at the intersection of the six cooling and repump beams . </S>",
    "<S> ions are created from the excited mot atoms , by absorption of a photon fom a blue light source ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> the out of phase oscillating voltage on the quadrupole electrodes ( see x@xmath0y contour plot ) effects x@xmath0y trapping , while a constant end electrode voltage v@xmath3 v confines along the z direction ( see z potential ) . </S>",

    "<S> the port hole in the outer wall of the chamber constitutes a drift region for time - of - flight measurement of the ions extracted.,width=8 ]    the experimental schematic is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : experimentschematic ] and the experimental technique  @xcite and operational details are briefly described in the methods section . </S>",

    "<S> the ions are detected by a channel electron multiplier ( cem ) and amplifier assembly , which converts the incident extracted ions from the trap to a proportional voltage signal .    to demonstrate the cooling of trapped ions by collision with mot atoms , we closely follow the early , seminal work of major and dehmelt  @xcite . in describing the ion@xmath0atom collisions </S>",

    "<S> the post collision velocity of the ion @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a unit vector at an angle @xmath18 with respect to @xmath14 , @xmath19 is the ion mass , @xmath20 the atom mass and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the ion motion can be decomposed into its macromotion and its in - phase micromotion oscillation with the applied electric field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pre and post collision ion velocities then are , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the respective secular velocities , @xmath26 , is the micromotion velocity and @xmath27 is the phase of the electric field @xmath28 at the instant of collision . </S>",
    "<S> it is the reduction in the average secular motion velocity , @xmath29 with collisions ( time ) , that leads to ion cooling ( see the methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> all collisions with the mot atoms occur close to the origin , where @xmath30 , leading to ion cooling irrespective of @xmath31 due to a reduction of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the average cooling efficiency per collision is maximum for @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore the spatially compact density of the mot which leads to the collisional cooling of the ions .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis above , is valid for elastic scattering . for rb@xmath34rb collisions the rcx channel  @xcite plays a key role in cooling the rb@xmath1 ions . in rcx , the atomic valence electron transfers from atom to ion with no change in the dynamical or internal states of the colliding partners , apart from swapping their respective charge states . for the ion@xmath0atom collision energy ( @xmath35 ) involved in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the rcx cross section @xmath36 , is comparable to the ion - atom elastic cross section  @xcite @xmath37 , so both channels participate in ion cooling . in those glancing collisions where rcx occurs , the swapping of the charge state results in an ion at rest . </S>",
    "<S> this swap cooling occurs preferentially at the ion trap minimum , where the mot density is maximum . </S>",
    "<S> since glancing collisions are overwhelmingly more probable than head - on collisions , the rcx mechanism for transferring energy from ions to atoms dominates the elastic channel . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the evolution of ion cooling by elastic and rcx processes , in a multiple scattering framework , is brought out in the numerical simulations discussed below .    </S>",

    "<S> elastic  @xcite and rcx  @xcite collisions are both incorporated in the simulation ( see the methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean ion kinetic energy is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kineng](a ) , and mean position displacement of the ion ensemble in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kineng](b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> ion cooling is clear from the reduction of mean kinetic energy per ion and the narrowing of the spatial spread of the non - interacting ions in the trap with time . </S>",
    "<S> the step changes in the kinetic energy occur for either a head on elastic or glancing rcx collision at the trap bottom . </S>",
    "<S> the ions cool much faster when the rcx channel is active along with the elastic one . </S>",
    "<S> the atom density is kept constant at the trap center to emphasize the role of compactness in the distribution of atoms for ion cooling . </S>",
    "<S> naturally a compact gradient distribution of the atoms further enhances ion cooling .     </S>",
    "<S> ion counts as a function of @xmath46 . without a mot , </S>",
    "<S> the ions exit the trap rapidly , while with cold atoms the ion loss is much slower and a stable number of ions ( @xmath47 ) is trapped without detectable loss beyond @xmath48 minutes . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( b ) illustrates the variation of the fwhm of the ion tof distribution against @xmath46 for the two cases . for case </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the fwhm increases in time as the trap empties out , while for case ( 2 ) a systematic decrease in the ion tof distribution is seen , consistent with ion cooling . for @xmath48 min , when the trapped ion number has stabilized , the tof width is still decreasing indicating continued ion cooling , as illustrated by a least square fit to the last six data points . </S>",
    "<S> the insets serve to illustrate case ( 1 ) data with clarity . </S>",

    "<S> the rb dispenser and the gradient magnetic field are on throughout the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the cold atoms are loaded ( emptied ) from the mot , by switching the atom cooling and repump lasers on ( off ) , with a mechanical shutter . </S>",
    "<S> initially , while the mot is loaded for @xmath49 s to saturation , the ion trap rf field is off . for ion loading , the ionizing blue light is briefly pulsed on for @xmath50 s , simultaneously with switching on the ion trap rf field for the remainder of the experimental cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the ions are trapped for a hold time , @xmath46 , following which they are extracted onto the cem by switching v@xmath6 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : experimentschematic ] . </S>",
    "<S> the cem ion count is measured as a function of @xmath46 for two cases ( 1 ) without mot atoms and ( 2 ) with mot atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the cem ion counts vs. @xmath46 is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lifetime](a ) and the fwhm of the ion arrival time - of - flight ( tof ) distribution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lifetime](b ) . for case </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) all the ions exit the trap by @xmath51 s and the tof fwhm increases rapidly . in case </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for @xmath52 s , the ion loss rate from the trap drops and so does the fwhm of the ion tof distribution . beyond @xmath48 minutes , the number of trapped ions stabilizes to a constant value , while the width of the tof distribution nominally decreases , indicating that ion cooling is still underway . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that a number equilibrium between daughter ions and laser cooled parent atoms is achieved and a thermally stable equilibrium exists within experimental means . </S>",
    "<S> finally since the cooling rate of the ion must overcome the heating rate for long term trapping , the lower bound on the initial cooling rate per ion is @xmath53 ev / s , as derived from fitting the heating observed in the mot off measurement .    in our explanation of the above ion cooling we have exclusively focussed on the binary ion@xmath0atom interaction . within this restriction </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the ions are effectively cooled by collision with the localized , cold mot atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it is the continuous atom cooling , which indirectly bleeds away energy from the trapped ions , and the constant number of atoms in the reservoir ( mot ) that has the capacity to cool the ions . without these two features </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously in place , the trapped ions will empty the atom trap very quickly , because of ion heating by various mechanisms and the relatively strong @xmath54 ion@xmath0atom interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of ion@xmath0ion interactions on the cooling and the stabilization of the ion numbers has not been theoretically addressed here . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of ground and excited state populations within the cold atoms , with different polarizabilities , has also been ignored in the discussions . while these have an important part to play in the determination of the final state of the system , these details are not of primary relevance to the binary collisional cooling principle demonstrated here .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that localized parent atom @xmath0 daughter ion collisions allow a viable ion cooling technique . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important development in understanding collisional cooling of ions and leads to intriguing questions for future study . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , what is the ultimate temperature to which the ions can be cooled by atoms ? what is the equilibrium state and configuration of the cooled ion@xmath0atom system </S>",
    "<S> ? how are collective oscillations of the ions damped in this rcx active system ? </S>",
    "<S> most significantly , the stabilization of the cold ion@xmath0atom system sets the stage for ion involved production of cold molecules and generalization to studies with multiple species . </S>"
