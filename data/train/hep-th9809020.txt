    "the wilsonian renormalisation group @xcite has proven itself as a powerful tool for studying both perturbative and non - perturbative effects in quantum field theory .",
    "one may expect that a suitable formulation for non - abelian gauge theories provides new insight to non - perturbative effects in qcd .",
    "however the wilsonian approach is based on the concept of a step - by - step integrating - out of momentum degrees of freedom and one may wonder whether this concept can be adopted for gauge theories .    in the current contribution",
    "we investigate this question in a path integral approach based on ideas of polchinski @xcite . in this approach a momentum cut - off",
    "is achieved by adding a cut - off term @xmath1 to the action which is quadratic in the field .",
    "this results in an effective action @xmath2 where momenta larger than @xmath3 have been integrated - out .",
    "the change of @xmath4 under an infinitesimal variation of the scale @xmath3 is described by a flow equation which can be used to successively integrate - out the momenta smaller than the cut - off scale @xmath3 .",
    "thus given an effective action @xmath5 at an initial scale @xmath6 the flow equation provides us with a recipe how to calculate the full effective action @xmath7 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath1 seems to break gauge invariance .",
    "however , @xmath4 satisfies a ` modified ' ward identity ( mwi ) .",
    "this mwi commutes with the flow and approaches the usual ward identity ( wi ) as @xmath8 . consequently the full effective action @xmath7 satisfies the usual ward identity .",
    "in other words , gauge invariance of the full theory is preserved if the effective action @xmath5 satisfies the mwi at the initial scale @xmath6 .",
    "to be more explicit let us briefly outline the derivation of the flow equation : we add the following scale - dependent term to the action ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) : [ cut - off1 ] _ k s [ ] = ^d x^ * r^_k[p _ ] , where @xmath9 is proportional to the bare propagator of @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a short - hand notation for all fields .",
    "@xmath12 is the dimension of space - time .",
    "the regulator @xmath13 has the properties : [ limits ] r_k^[x ] k^d-2 d _ ,",
    "r_k^ 0 , where @xmath14 are the dimensions of the fields @xmath10 .",
    "the cut - off term effectively suppresses modes with momenta @xmath15 in the generating functional . for modes with large momenta @xmath16 the cut - off term vanishes and in this regime",
    "the theory remains unchanged . in the limit @xmath17 we approach the full generating functional @xmath7 since the cut - off term is removed . in the limit @xmath18 all momenta",
    "are suppressed and the effective action approaches the ( gauge fixed ) classical action @xmath19 .",
    "hence @xmath4 interpolates between the classical action and the full effective action : [ 0infty ] s_cl+s_gf _ k .",
    "an infinitesimal variation of the generating functional with respect to @xmath3 is described by the flow equation . for the generating functional of 1pi green functions , the effective action @xmath4 , the flow equation can be written in the form ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) [ flow ]",
    "\\ { g^^*_k [ ] _ t r^_k[p _ ] } , with [ props ] g^^*_i _ j_k[]= ( + r_k , ij^[p_])^-1 , where @xmath20 and the trace @xmath21 denotes a sum over momenta , indices and the different fields @xmath10 including a minus sign for fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "note that @xmath22 serves as a smeared - out @xmath23-function in momentum space peaked at about @xmath24 .",
    "thus by varying the scale @xmath3 towards smaller @xmath3 according to one successively integrates - out momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "the starting point of our considerations is the classical action of qcd with @xmath25 colours and @xmath26 flavours including cut - off terms for the gauge field and the fermions : s_k[a,,| ] & = & s_cl[a,,|]+s_gf[a ] + & & + _ k s_a[a]+_k s _ , [ classical ] where @xmath27 is just the classical euclidean action of qcd with fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "we allow for a general linear gauge fixing term [ gf ] s_gf[a]=^4 x l_a_^a l_a_^a , which includes general lorentz gauges ( @xmath28 ) and general axial gauges ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the cut - off terms are given by _",
    "k s_a[a ] & = ^4 x a_^a r_k,^a , ab a_^b , + _",
    "k s _ & = ^4 x |_s^a r^,ab_k , st _",
    "t^b , [ cut - off ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to the fundamental and to the adjoint representations respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath31 are summed over all flavours .",
    "a convenient choice for the regulators @xmath32 is r_k,^a , ab[p^2]&= _ ^ab , + r^,ab_k , st[p^2]&=_st ^ab^12 .",
    "[ regulators ] it is easy to see that the regulators in have the demanded properties .",
    "the fadeev - popov determinant arising from the gauge fixing may be regularised in a similar way . however , for the sake of brevity we drop these terms in the following .",
    "the cut - off terms generate additional terms in the ward identity for @xmath4 .",
    "this modified ward identity ( mwi ) is [ mwi ] + & & -g ^4 y f^abc(^cd + r^a , cd_k , ) g^aa , db_k , + & & + g ^4 y ( t^a)^bcr^,cd_k , st g^|,db_k , ts = 0 where @xmath33 are the gauge group generators in the fundamental representation and @xmath34 is the adjoint of @xmath35 . we also have used the definition of the full ( field dependent ) propagators and have introduced the following short - hand notation : [ jpsi ] j^,a=|^a(t^a)^ab _ k|^b + _ k^a(t^a)^ab^b .",
    "the cut - off dependent terms in vanish for @xmath8 .",
    "however the mwi is of use only if one can show that the flow of @xmath4 is compatible with . for this purpose",
    "we examine @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37-derivative of the right - hand side of yields expressions dependent on @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for the last of these we use the flow equation and after some algebra we arrive at [ @xmath40 : + & & - ( g^^*_i_j_k _ t r^_j_k g^^*_j_l_k ) ^a_k .",
    "[ compatible ] let us assume that the initial effective action @xmath5 satisfies the mwi which can be achieved at least order - by - order in perturbation theory .",
    "then @xmath41 is zero since it is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "thus it follows @xmath43 for all @xmath3 and the mwi is satisfied at all scales , in particular for @xmath44 .",
    "it approaches the usual wi for @xmath8 since the cut - off dependent terms vanish . as a consequence we only have to ensure that the initial effective action satisfies the mwi in order to ensure gauge invariance of the full theory .",
    "as a first application we want to present some analytic results . analytic computations would simplify tremendously if we still dealt with a theory satisfying the usual wi instead of . in this case the number of possible terms in the effective action is restricted by gauge symmetry .",
    "even though this can not be achieved one can get very close to such a situation . for this purpose",
    "it is quite convenient to introduce the following regulators : ( r^a_k[p^2],r^_k[p^2])(r_k[d_t(|a)],r^_k[^2(|a ) ] ) , [ newregs ] with d_t,^ab =- d_^ac d_^cb -2 g f_c^abf_^c , and @xmath45 is the dirac operator in the fundamental representation . here",
    "@xmath46 is an arbitrary gauge field configuration .",
    "note that if one allows for regulators with a non - trivial group structure the set of regulators @xmath47,r^\\psi_k[\\dr^2]$ ] coincides with the set of regulators for @xmath48,r^\\psi_k[p]$ ] : @xmath49,r^\\psi_k[p]\\}=\\{r_k[d_t],r^\\psi_k[\\dr^2]\\}$ ] .",
    "thus one may interpret @xmath46 as an index labeling a family of different cut - offs .",
    "the effective action now depends on @xmath46 : @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "it is simple to see that the cut - off dependent terms in are just given by an infinitesimal gauge transformation of @xmath46 , hence leading to the identity + & & -g ^4 y f^abc r^a , cd_k,[d_t(|a ) ] g^aa , db_k , + & & + g ^4 y ( t^a)^bcr^,cd_k , st[^2(|a ) ] g^|,db_k , ts[barwi ] .",
    "we conclude from and that @xmath51:= \\gamma_k[a,\\bar a = a,\\psi,\\bar\\psi]$ ] satisfies the usual wi without the cut - off dependent terms : d_^ab - d_^abl^*_l _",
    "a_^b+j^,a(x ) + -g ^4 y f^abc^cd g^aa , db_k , = 0,[wi ] where the gauge field derivative involved in hits both the gauge field @xmath52 and the auxiliary field @xmath53 .",
    "note however that the propagator @xmath54 is still the one derived from @xmath55 $ ] at @xmath53 .",
    "moreover the flow equation for @xmath56 requires the knowledge of @xmath54 , thus slightly spoiling the advantage of dealing with an effective action which satisfies the usual wi even for @xmath57 .",
    "a possible way to proceed from would be to reformulate it in terms of brst transformations of the fields",
    ". then one can expand the action @xmath56 in brst - invariant terms .",
    "moreover if we restrict ourselves to gauges where neither @xmath58 nor @xmath35 depend on derivatives , the last term in vanishes and we do not have any integral terms in the wi ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is a very attractive case where all the following considerations simplify tremendously from a technical point of view .    as a consequence of we",
    "have gained gauge invariance even for @xmath57 which simplifies the expansion of the effective action .",
    "the problem is now to distinguish between the gauge field @xmath52 and the field @xmath53 which only serves as an auxiliary variable .",
    "this is necessary since the flow equation still requires the knowledge of @xmath59 as mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath46-dependence of @xmath60 is given by the following equation : _ t_k= _ t \\{g^^*_k[,|a ] |a r^_k}. [ bar a ] with , , and we can investigate the effective action analytically .",
    "it is worth noting that the flow equation is a ` 1-loop ' equation , even though the loops depend on the full field dependent propagator .",
    "thus heat kernel methods can be employed .",
    "however we want to emphasise that the heat kernel is not used as a regularisation method since everything is finite from the onset .",
    "let us now briefly sketch the calculation of the ( perturbative ) 1-loop and 2-loop @xmath0-function .",
    "since these coefficients of the @xmath0-function are universal their calculation serves as a consistency check of the formalism .",
    "moreover it provides some additional insight in how perturbation theory is recovered in this approach .    on the right - hand side of the flow equation",
    "we have to insert the initial effective action @xmath5 . at 1-loop level",
    "it is sufficient to insert the classical action @xmath19 with multiplicative renormalisation , namely @xmath61 .",
    "moreover at 1-loop level one can show with the help of and that the usual relation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 is valid .",
    "this relation depends on the chosen gauge , e.g.  for the axial gauge it leads to @xmath64 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath65 is calculated by projecting out the term @xmath66 on the right hand - side side of the flow equation .",
    "the result leads to ( @xmath67 ) : _",
    "g^2=-g_k^4(223n_c-43 n_f ) + o(g_k^6 ) , the well - known universal 1-loop result for a non - abelian gauge theory coupled to fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "moreover it can be shown that this holds true for general linear gauges .    in order to derive",
    "the 2-loop coefficient for the @xmath0-function one has to take into account not only the renormalisation constants @xmath68 but also terms which can be derived from the mwi when examined at 1-loop level .",
    "additionally one has to examine which in general is non - zero at 2-loop level @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasise that the calculations outlined above not only provide the @xmath0-functions but also furnish one with correction terms to the effective action at 2-loop level to all orders of the fields .",
    "we have investigated non - abelian gauge theories coupled to fermions within a wilsonian renormalisation group approach .",
    "gauge invariance of the effective action at a given ( infrared ) scale @xmath3 is controlled by a modified ward identity which is compatible with the flow equation . the mwi guarantees gauge invariance for the full effective action at @xmath44 . by introducing an auxiliary gauge field @xmath46 gauge invariance can be restored even for @xmath57 .",
    "the price to pay is an additional equation for the @xmath46-dependence .    as a consistency",
    "check the 1-loop @xmath0-function can be calculated for general linear gauges .",
    "even more so , the extension of this calculation to 2-loop effects is straightforward ( even though tedious ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here also give a flavour of the main advantage of the formalism , namely its flexibility concerning possible approximations , in particular beyond perturbation theory .",
    "this makes it an appropriate tool for studying non - perturbative physics .",
