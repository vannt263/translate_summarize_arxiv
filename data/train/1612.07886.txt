    "for a non - interacting fermi gas , textbooks ( e.g. @xcite ) teach us that the specific heat at finite but low temperature @xmath2 is a power series involving only odd powers in @xmath2 , as can be easily be shown by sommerfeld expansion .",
    "correspondingly , the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 and temperature @xmath2 , is thus a power series in @xmath2 involving only even powers in @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , this result is qualitatively modified for an interacting fermi system , even with short - range interactions in two or three dimensions . though the first term in the expansion for the specific heat in @xmath2 indeed starts with @xmath2 , ( for @xmath0 , a constant and a @xmath6 term ) ,",
    "the next term is now widely believed ( see references below ) to be of the form @xmath7 ( correspondingly for @xmath0 , @xmath3 ) for three dimensions , thus not even analytic in @xmath2 . thoroughly understanding these possible non - analytic terms in the specific heat or",
    "thus the free energy is crucial in order to understand the more complicated cases of possible non - fermi liquid phases such as those associated with quantum critical points@xcite .",
    "historically , the study of this @xmath7 term was motivated by the experimental observation in normal @xmath8he that the specific heat can not be fitted by a sommerfeld form @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , this non - analytic term can be understood as a result of the presence of bosonic excitations ( interacting particle - hole pairs ) in the system , even though these bosonic excitations are not necessarily propagating modes but can be overdamped ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more interestingly , for the @xmath7 term at least , the result can be obtained via a proper extension @xcite of the original landau fermi liquid theory @xcite , and the coefficient of this @xmath7 term can be entirely expressed in terms of scattering amplitudes between landau quasiparticles on the fermi surface .",
    "the non - analytic behavior in specific heat or free energy is a consequence of the non - analytic behavior of the density and spin susceptibilities of the system at finite frequency and wave - vectors @xcite .",
    "the theories of @xcite yield results for this term that is in reasonable agreement with experiments @xcite in @xmath8he .",
    "however , precise statements are difficult to make due to some uncertainties in the interacting parameters in this system ( see , e.g. discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath7 term has also been studied in heavy fermion materials such as upt@xmath9 and ual@xmath10 @xcite . in these systems , there are even more uncertainties since the interaction parameters there are even less known than @xmath8he .",
    "therefore it is highly desirable to have another system where these theories can be tested .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the thermodynamic potential for interacting su(n ) fermi gases such as @xmath11yb and @xmath12sr which are available now in cold atom experiments @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .",
    "these @xmath13 components ( we use @xmath13 rather than @xmath1 here to avoid possible confusion with the number of particles . ) represent the different choices of hyperfine spin sublevels @xmath14 available to the atoms . @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath12sr .",
    "we would like to in particular examine whether these systems can serve as candidates to test these theories .",
    "both the number of components @xmath13 , ( @xmath13 can vary from @xmath18 to @xmath19 in @xmath11yb and @xmath18 to @xmath20 in @xmath12sr ) and the density ( hence the dimensionless coupling constant defined below ) can be varied in experiments .",
    "( the former is possible due to the su(n ) symmetry of the interparticle interaction @xcite . ) for a sufficiently large cloud of gas where the local density approximation can be taken , the pressure @xmath21 of the gas ( which is equal to @xmath22 per unit volume ) can be deduced from the axial density @xcite .",
    "since the effective chemical potential varies across the trap , analysis of this data can then produce the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath0 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "if the temperature can also be obtained , then the function @xmath23 can be measured and compared with theory .",
    "the above has already been carried out extensively for many systems , including two component resonant fermi gases @xcite , one - component interacting bose gases @xcite , and we expect that the same can be done for the @xmath11yb and @xmath12sr systems eventually .",
    "previously we have investigated theoretically the fermi liquid properties of this su(n ) fermi gas at zero temperature @xcite , and we here extend to finite temperatures . in principle the non - analytic terms in the free energy can also be investigated for the resonant two - component system or multicomponent fermi system without @xmath24 symmetry , but we shall discuss how the variable @xmath13 may offer us some advantage .    in this paper , we shall then evaluate the thermodynamic potential for the su@xmath25 fermi gas a finite temperatures .",
    "while the theories in @xcite pointed out the existence of a @xmath7 term in the specific heat and thus a @xmath3 in @xmath26 , these calculations were not verified numerically to the best of our knowledge .",
    "more importantly , they also offer no hint as to what the temperature range would be where one can find such non - analytic terms .",
    "we here evaluate the contributions to @xmath26 term by term numerically at arbitrary temperatures which then allow us to answer this question .",
    "we present here the evaluation of the thermodynamic potential @xmath26 of a @xmath13 component interacting fermi gas as a function of the chemical potential @xmath5 and temperature @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath5 is taken to be the same for all @xmath13 components .",
    "the interparticle interaction is characterized by the a positive three dimensional s - wave scattering length @xmath27 , which is the same irrespective of the hyperfine spin sublevels @xmath14 of the fermions participating in the interaction @xcite .",
    "note that the pressure @xmath21 is just @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the volume .",
    "we evaluate @xmath26 up to second order in @xmath27 , expressed as a power series in the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mass of an atom .",
    "the zeroth order term of @xmath26 in @xmath30 is simply that of the free gas , @xmath33 , and hence given by    _ 0 ( , t ) = n_c _ k    where @xmath34 is just the kinetic energy , f_k^0 ( , t ) the fermi function , both of a free particle of wavevector @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "we have thus _ 0 ( , t ) = v n_c t ( 1 - f_k^0 ) [ omega0 ]     and second order contributions @xmath37 , @xmath38 in interaction to the thermodynamic potential .",

    "we thus have _ 1 ( , t ) = v n^0 _ n^0 _ [ omega1 ] where there is no sum over @xmath45 in the above formula , and @xmath46 is simply the number density of the @xmath41 component , given by @xmath47 .",
