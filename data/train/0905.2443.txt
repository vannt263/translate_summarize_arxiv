    "wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) are the post main - sequence descendants of the most massive stars ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "they are hot ( @xmath1=30,000140,000 k ; hamann et al .",
    "2006 ) , luminous ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) , and owing to their evolved state , exhibit the products of core cno processing at their surfaces .",
    "for the duration of the wr phase ( few@xmath410@xmath5 yr ) , dense winds are radiatively accelerated to hypersonic velocities , in the range",
    "@xmath6@xmath7 km s@xmath8 , resulting in high mass - loss rates of @xmath9@xmath10  yr@xmath8 ( e.  g. , see crowther 2008 ; hillier 2008 ) .",
    "thus , as sources of ionization and mechanical energy , wrs have a profound influence on the surrounding ism over many pc .",
    "wrs are characterized by strong emission lines in their spectra , which are generated and velocity - broadened within their fast , extended winds .",
    "they are classified into subtypes of wn ( nitrogen type ) , wc ( carbon type ) and wo ( oxygen type ) , based upon the relative dominance of n , c , and o emission - lines in their spectra .",
    "as wrs evolve and shed material , they become increasingly h and he deficient , and expose deeper and hotter regions of their atmospheres , and so are thought to follow an evolutionary sequence of wn@xmath11wc@xmath11wo ( e.g. , langer et al .  1994 ; norci et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in our galaxy ,",
    "optical emission - line ( he @xmath124686 ) surveys have identified nearly all wr stars with @xmath13 mag ( shara et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , the number of wrs identified in the optical ( @xmath14 ; van der hucht 2003 ) constitute a small fraction of the total predicted wr population , the majority of which is expected to be optically obscured by dust in the galactic plane .",
    "fortunately , our ability to detect wrs is greatly enhanced with infrared observations , which effectively penetrate the ism ( e.g. , at 2 @xmath15 m , @xmath16% ) .",
    "shara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) predict that 97% of galactic wr stars should have @xmath17 mag and , depending on the adopted wr distribution model , @xmath1850% should have @xmath19 mag .",
    "thus , the majority of wrs should be accessible with existing instrumentation , while roughly half of them should have be present in the 2mass catalog of cutri et al .",
    "most searches for obscured wrs have been executed using near - infrared , narrow - band imaging searches , which isolate strong emission lines ( blum & damineli 1999 ; homeier et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "although successful , such observations are expensive time - wise and limited in coverage .",
    "fortunately , the near - infrared and mid - infrared continua of wrs provide an alternative means of selection , allowing wr searches to take advantage of recent near- and mid - infrared surveys of the galactic plane , e.  g. , by 2mass and _ spitzer_/glimpse ( benjamin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all wr stars exhibit infrared excess .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that wrs are clearly separable from the vast majority of field stars in @xmath20 $ ] versus @xmath21 , and @xmath22-[8.0]$ ] versus @xmath22-[4.5]~{\\micron}$ ] color spaces .",
    "the locus of wrs within these color spaces form the basis of a selection criterion for isolating new candidate wrs within the area of sky covered by the 2mass@xmath23_spitzer_/glimpse surveys .",
    "hadfield et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used these color criteria , only selecting sources with the highest quality 2mass photometry ( a  aaa \" photometric - quality flag of sorts ) , to define a sample of @xmath185000 candidate wrs detected in the glimpse - i survey , which covered an area of the galactic plane bound by @xmath24@xmath25 and @xmath26@xmath27 , with @xmath28 ; follow - up spectroscopy resulted in the detection of 15 new wrs and @xmath18120 other hot , evolved massive stars .",
    "the continuum color excess in wrs is mainly due to free - free emission from e@xmath29 scattering off of he@xmath30 ions in the outer regions of their dense winds ( wright & barlow 1975 ; cohen et al .",
    "1975 ; morris et al . 1993 ) .",
    "in general , the infrared free - free excess of wrs becomes increasingly important with wavelength ; the free - free spectrum rises as the wavelength increases from the near- to mid - infrared , while the rayleigh - jeans stellar continuum decreases .",
    "the free - free continuum excess is also supplemented by contributions from strong , broad emission lines that can affect the broad band fluxes of wrs , and produce scatter in the overall color trend .",
    "however , a significant emission - line  induced reddening or blueing of the colors in figure 1 , relative to the overall color trend , would require that emission lines have a relatively high flux in one particular band .",
    "thermal emission may also significantly alter the broad - band fluxes , as in the case of some wc stars that are associated with hot dust ( cohen et al . 1975 ) .",
    "the outlier in figure 1 ( left panel ) with very red @xmath31 $ ] color is the dusty wc7d+o9iii binary wr 125 , and so has a very large excess at 8 .",
    "this implies that the 2mass@xmath23_spitzer_/glimpse wr selection criteria , as it currently stands , may be biased against wrs with very large thermal excesses due to dust .",
    "however , we are not biased to the exclusion of all wrs with thermal dust emission , since the datapoint lying closest to the upper - right area of figure 1 ( left panel ) , within the wr selection area , represents a new wr that is associated with thermal dust excess ( see  5.2 ) .    in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will present the results of a more detailed investigation of the various phenomenology contributing to the near- to mid - infrared excesses in galactic wrs and other evolved massive stars , including emission lines and thermal dust emission . as a result",
    ", we will also continue to refine the color selection criteria for discovering new wrs .",
    "this work is simply a continuation of the spectroscopic follow - up of wr candidates identified using the current selection algorithm .",
    "we report on the discovery of 12 additional wrs .",
    "spectra of candidate wrs were obtained in the optical and near - infrared at several facilities over the past 5 years .",

    "however , hard x - ray emission is common if wrs are members of binaries , such as @xmath82 vel and wr 65 ( henley et al . 2005 ; oskinova & hamann 2008 ) , which are systems in which the supersonic wind of the wr collides with the opposing wind of a companion .",
    "the optical spectrum of 2mass j18281180@xmath391025424 , presented in  3.1 , indicates the presence of a obi companion to the wc9 star , so the emission of hard x - rays from colliding winds would not be surprising .    to calculate the x - ray luminosity of 2mass j18281180@xmath391025424 we converted the value of @xmath83 mag ( see  4 ) to an equivalent hydrogen column density , using the relation of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) , and obtained @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "we then used to obtain the unabsorbed x - ray flux from the source by entering the observed number of counts in the 0.46 kev band and applying a raymond - smith thermal plasma spectrum with solar metallicity ( raymond & smith 1977 ) .",
    "we performed several trials using plasma temperatures in the range @xmath863.0 kev , which is a reasonable range of temperatures one could assume for the hot component of colliding - wind binary .",
    "the calculations yielded unabsorbed fluxes between ( @xmath87@xmath88 erg @xmath85 s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "thus , we used an unabsorbed flux value of @xmath89 erg s@xmath8 and applied our derived distance of @xmath69 kpc to obtain an x - ray luminosity of @xmath90 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "this is similar to the x - ray luminosities of known wc9+ob binaries , such as wr 65 ( oskinova & hamann 2008 ) .",
    "most known wc9+ob binaries are associated with excess thermal emission from hot dust , which supplements the free - free excess from the stellar wind ( cohen et al .",
    "1975 ; williams et al . 1987 ; van der hucht et al .",
    "1996 ; williams et al .",
    "it is thought that the dust is produced via the collision of a carbon - rich wc wind with a hydrogen - rich ob wind ( le teuff 2002 ) , which mix and form dust within regions of the collision wake that are shielded from destructive uv photons ( e.  g. , see cherchneff et al .",
    "2000 ; crowther et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) . to investigate the possibility of thermal dust emission from the new wc9@xmath23obi binary star 2mass j18281180@xmath391025424 , we compared the photometry of this source with that of several known wc9 stars from literature , including the dusty wc9d star wr 59 ( van der hucht 2001 ) and the non - dusty wc9 stars hdm6 and hdm13 ( hadfield et al .",
    "figure 10 displays the infrared spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of these stars , which were de - reddened using the extinction relations of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and indebetouw et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . for comparison , rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) curves of sources with @xmath91 kk",
    "are also plotted in figure 10 and scaled to the @xmath92-band data point of each source , although using any of the full range of known wr / ob temperatures would result in a negligible difference , owing to the temperature degeneracy of the rj slope .",
    "the seds of 2mass j18281180@xmath391025424 and the wc9d star wr 59 both rise between the @xmath74 and @xmath93 bands and exhibit relatively high excess in the mid - infrared ( saturated at @xmath124.5 ) .",
    "these features are typical of thermal emission from hot dust . by comparison , the smaller excess in the seds of hdm6 and hdm13 , which maintain a decreasing slope with wavelength ,",
    "are typical of free - free emission from non - dusty wc9 stars ( e.  g. , see cohen et al .",
    "this indicates that the wc9@xmath23obi binary 2mass j18281180@xmath391025424 is very likely to be a source of thermal emission from hot dust .    in general , the seds of dust - producing wc9+ob binaries",
    "are modeled with multiple hot dust shells that have a gradient in temperature ( williams , van der hucht & th 1987 ) .",
    "detailed sed modeling is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that the large excess in the @xmath38 band and the overall behavior of mid - infrared sed suggest a dust temperature on the order of @xmath94 k , which is typical of dust - producing wc9+ob binaries . in conclusion ,",
    "we classify 2mass j18281180@xmath391025424 as a dust - producing wc9d@xmath23obi binary .",
    "figures 9 and 11 contain 2mass @xmath93-band field images of the new wrs . in most cases ,",
    "they appear relatively isolated , with no obvious stellar density enhancement in their vicinity .",
    "an exception is the wc8 star 2mass j13125770@xmath396240599 .",
    "this star is appears associated with the h ii region g305 and the star cluster danks 1 ( georgelin et al .",
    "1988 ; danks et al .",
    "this cluster is one of a pair of dense stellar clusters , danks 1 and 2 , that lie near the center of a cavity that is defined by a three - lobed structure of mid - infrared emission .",
    "one wr has already been associated with this region , the wc star wr 48a ( see clark & porter 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "the system lies at a distance of 3.54 kpc from the sun , which is consistent with our derived photometric distance of 3.6 kpc to 2mass j13125770@xmath396240599 .",
    "the presence of 2 wc stars within this system suggests that there may be additional wrs in this environment at earlier evolutionary stages , such as wn stars , that have yet to be identified . within a angular radius of @xmath95 surrounding the danks 1 and 2 clusters",
    ", there are 6 additional wr candidates that were selected by our criteria , although they are fainter than the confirmed wc stars in this region by @xmath963 mag in the @xmath93 band and lie in the outskirts of the clusters . as in hadfield et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , our selection criteria are restricted to sources that have only the highest photometric quality in the 2mass catalog . as a result , we are biased against the detection of wrs in regions of significant stellar confusion , such as the interior regions of the clusters danks 1 and 2 .",
    "thus , it would not be surprising if , in the future , more wrs are confirmed within danks 1 and 2 that were not selected by our method .",
    "indeed , if we relax the near - infrared photometric - quality restriction we obtain a total of 17 unidentified wr candidates that appear spatially concentrated in the g305 region , within @xmath95 of the clusters .",
    "alternatively , the 2 confirmed wc stars in this region may represent the few remaining wrs from danks 1 , which would be consistent with the upper limit on the age of danks 1 ( 5 myr ; clark & porter 2004 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the remaining wr candidates in this region will probably be non - wr emission - line stars , similar to those that dominate our sample ( e.  g. , see hadfield et al .",
    "2007 , their figure 7 ) . in the future",
    "we plan to obtain spectra of all wr candidates in the g305 region , including those having relatively low photometric quality .",
    "this will not only elucidate the nature of the danks 1 and 2 clusters , but will also be useful in quantifying the limitations of our wr selection criteria in regions of high stellar confusion .    in comparison with 2mass j13125770@xmath396240599 ,",
    "the rest of the wrs appear relatively isolated , as is also the case for most of the 15 wrs reported in hadfield et al .",
    "this motivates the question as to whether wrs form exclusively in clusters and associations , or may also form via an alternate mode of isolated massive - star formation .",
    "it is also possible that wrs form in clusters and associations , but are sometimes dynamically ejected , either by inter - cluster dynamics or the supernova explosion of an erstwhile companion .",
    "indeed , it has been noted that half of all o stars are runaways ( de wit et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , and references therein ) , and the same might be true for wrs , since they are descended from o stars ( dray et al .",
    "any of these possibilities could be an explanation for the spatial distribution of our sample .",
    "proper motion measurements would be required to constrain these origin scenarios , in addition to a more complete spectroscopic survey of neighboring stars .",
    "we save a full investigation of the environments of these stars for a future paper .",
    "the selection of candidate wrs based upon their near - infrared and mid - infrared colors has proven successful .",
    "the method mainly benefits from the mid - infrared excess emission , generated via free - free reactions in the dense , ionized winds of wrs .",
    "we identified 12 new wrs , including 9 wn and 3 wc stars .",
    "these discoveries add to the earlier results of hadfield et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and bring the total number of wrs identified in this way to 27 .",
    "however , the modest detection rate of @xmath1810% for wrs is accompanied by a non - wr , emission - line star detection rate of @xmath97 , so the latter are our main contaminant . in the interest of increasing the efficiency of wr detection",
    ", we must consider ways in which our selection criteria may be improved . in principle",
    ", we may exploit the fact that the free - free emission spectra of wrs tends to become optically thick at wavelengths longer than @xmath185 ( wright & barlow 1975 ; cohen et al .",
    "1975 ) , with a predictable spectral index .",
    "this information may be helpful in distinguishing true wrs in our sample from other objects that exhibit similar color excesses in the 2mass and _ spitzer_/irac bands .",
    "we are also in the process of characterizing the spectral energy distributions of known wrs out to 24 , with the inclusion of data from the _ spitzer_/mipsgal survey of the inner galactic plane ( carey et al .",
    "although a more thorough analysis of the 24 photometry of wrs is forthcoming in an infrared phenomenological study of wrs , our preliminary results are encouraging : we have determined that confirmed , non - dusty wrs occupy a narrow subset of the 824 color space spanned by our current sample of wr candidates .",
    "although a refinement of our selection criteria using 824 colors may be biased toward wns , we speculate that wc9 stars with hot dust may also be distinguishable from other , cooler dusty sources whose excesses continue to rise with increasing wavelength beyond @xmath98 . in any case , assuming that our evolving wr selection criteria maintains a static success rate of 10% , we may expect to increase the known wr population in the galaxy from @xmath35300 to at least @xmath35800 , and perhaps over 1000 once we pursue candidate wrs within the glimpse - ii survey of the inner galaxy .",
    "this number is more - or - less consistent with the presumed number of galactic wrs that are expected to have @xmath19 mag ( shara et al .",
    "1999 ) , within the 2mass sensitivity limit .",
    "thus , our wr survey using 2mass@xmath23_spitzer_/glimpse has the potential to complete the wr sample for the near - half of the galaxy within the _ spitzer_/glimpse survey area .",
    "a sample increase of this significance will be invaluable in our effort to understand the evolution of wrs and their galactic demography , the evolution of massive stars in general , and the recent massive star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and ipac / caltech , funded by the nasa and the nsf .",
    "the research was based on observations made with the _",
