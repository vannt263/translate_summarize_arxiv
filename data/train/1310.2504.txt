    "following von neumann s prescription , a projective measurement of a variable will collapse or project a quantum state to one of the variable s eigenstates instantaneously and simultaneously in the whole time - slice that the wave - function is defined on .",
    "such wave - function collapse seems to be incompatible with relativity , where the transmission of physical information can not be faster than light and the simultaneity of the events depends on the reference frame .",
    "however , once a variable is defined locally in space , the projective measurements of it will respect causality . even in relativistic quantum field theory ( rqft )",
    ", projective measurements of isolated , spatially localized variables and the corresponding wave - functional collapse will be consistent with relativity @xcite .    when extended to the variables nonlocal in space ,",
    "the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "it has been shown that projective measurements of nonlocal variables can produce superluminal signals and so violate causality both in quantum mechanics ( qm ) with finite speed of physical information @xcite and in rqft @xcite .",
    "aharonov , albert , and vaidman thus introduced the causality principle , which identifies an operator @xmath0 associated with some variable in a theory as measurable only if , for every local observable defined at some space point @xmath1 , the probability of any specific outcome of measuring that local observable ( or its expectation value ) obtained at some moment @xmath2 after the measurement of the operator @xmath0 is independent of any local operation before the measurement of @xmath0 and spacelike separated from @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "they further showed that , by using two entangled pointlike probes or detectors each interacting locally in spacetime with one element of a qm atom - pair separated in space , some nonlocal variables of the two - atom system can be measured instantaneously on the probes without knowing the details of each atom . here a duration of the probe - atom interaction and a traveling time for the probes from the interaction region to the future measurement event are necessary , so the whole process is causal @xcite .",
    "similar methods have been successfully applied to more complicated qm systems @xcite .",
    "it is certainly interesting to extend these methods with local interactions and measurements to describe the measurements of nonlocal variables in rqft .",
    "our attempts in this direction applying the unruh - dewitt detector theory will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in this notes ,",
    "however , we are going in another direction : to see how far we can go in describing the measurements of nonlocal variables in qm and rqft using von neumann s prescription of the projective measurement , though the realization of such a nonlocal measurement is an outstanding issue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review an example given by sorkin @xcite in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we analyze the quantum nondemolition state - verification measurement in a two - spin system to see how it violates causality",
    ". then we look into the ideal measurements of nonlocal variables in the same system in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we extend our discussion to harmonic oscillators , then we look into the nonlocal measurement in rqft in section 6 . with the new knowledge we learned there ,",
    "we revisit sorkin s example in section 7 .",
    "finally we give a summary of our findings in section 8 .",
    "for the readers not familiar with rqft in the schrdinger picture , we offer some details about the wave - functional of a scalar field in appendix a.    before we start our discussion , let us distinguish two different nonlocalities . in @xcite",
    "a quantum measurement is said to be nonlocal if it extracted only part of the information in a composite qm system , e.g. , measuring the total spin angular momentum of two particles , without knowing the exact states of each element of the system .",
    "the effect of such kind of measurement is limited or localized in a subspace of the hilbert space of the system , while literally the degrees of freedom being measured may or may not be separated in the position space . to be more precise ,",
    "below we call an operation or a measurement of a variable  r-(non)local \" ( r for relativistic ) if the variable measured is defined ( non)locally in the position space , and  q-(non)local \" ( q for quantum ) if the effect of the measurement is ( non)localized in a subspace of the hilbert space of the composite system . for example",
    ", we say the measurement of the @xmath4-component of the total spin angular momentum @xmath5 of two spins @xmath6 and @xmath7 located at the same point is r - local and q - local , since the subspace of @xmath8 in the hilbert space is not affected by the measurement .",
    "later we will see that if the two spins are separated in the position space , the r - nonlocal measurement may be q - local or q - nonlocal , depending on the prescription .",
    "in ref . @xcite , sorkin demonstrated that a projective measurement of an one - particle state in rqft can violate causality . in his example , sorkin introduced the  yes \" projector @xmath9 and the  no \" projector @xmath10 for a one - particle state of some field mode with the wave vector @xmath11 , then argued that a local operation on a field degree of freedom @xmath12 at some position @xmath1 in space right before the  yes - no \" measurement on some time - slice can affect the expectation value of another field degree of freedom @xmath13 at a distance right after the measurement .",
    "such an influence is almost instantaneous and could be used to send superluminal signal , hence such kind of quantum measurement is not allowed in formulating rqft .    more explicitly , consider the setup in fig.[setup ] .",
    "suppose the initial state of the field is the minkowski vacuum @xmath14 . at @xmath15 , @xmath16 ,",
    "alice at @xmath1 applies an r - local operation @xmath17 to the field , so that the field state right before the measurement ( the pre - measurement state , pre - ms ) becomes @xmath18 . at @xmath19 , a measurement for checking",
    "whether the field is in the one - particle state of mode @xmath11 , @xmath20 , is performed : if the outcome is  yes \" , the field state will collapse to the post - measurement state ( post - ms ) @xmath20 (  nondemolition \" ) ; if  no \" , the post - ms will become @xmath21 up to a normalization factor , which is orthogonal to @xmath20 .",
    "then right after @xmath19 , bob at some point @xmath22 will find @xmath23 since the probabilities of finding the results  yes \" and  no \" are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath28 as @xmath29 @xcite , so @xmath30 depends on @xmath31 in general , no matter how far bob and alice are apart .",
    "this suggests that alice could manipulate the values of @xmath31 to send superluminal signal to bob , if such an r - nonlocal ( but q - local )  yes - no \" measurement were allowed .",
    ", one has to have many copies of the quantum states of the field .",
    "here we simply assume that this is possible . ]    in von neumann s prescription , when a system is measured by an external agency with an operator corresponding to a variable , the quantum state of the system will collapse instantaneously and discontinuously to one of the eigenstates associated with the operator .",
    "we say a process is an _ ideal measurement _ if it can be described in this way . when the eigenstates of that operator are non - degenerate , namely , the post - ms of the corresponding ideal measurement form a complete orthogonal set , we call it a _ complete orthogonal measurement _ @xcite .",
    "if there are degenerate eigenstates indistinguishable by the operator , the above prescription will not fix a specific complete set of the eigenstates as the post - ms .",
    "the above measurement in sorkin s example is an ideal measurement ( with eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath21 @xcite , but not a complete orthogonal measurement .",
    "such a  yes - no \" measurement is called the quantum nondemolition state - verification ( qndsv ) in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that this kind of measurements can produce superluminal signals even in simple qm systems with two localized objects separated in the position space . below",
    "we look into an example to see how this happens .",
    "consider two spin - particles a and b held by alice and bob , respectively , separated at a distance .",
    "similar to the setup in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , suppose before @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) the two - spin system is in the initial state @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the pauli matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 . at @xmath15",
    ", alice can either choose to do nothing on the state @xmath38 , or choose to rotate the spin of particle a by a unitary transformation @xmath39 so that @xmath40 where @xmath41 and latexmath:[$\\sigma_{j}^x     @xmath19 , a qndsv measurement is performed to verify whether the state is in @xmath43 , which is separable . then after the qndsv measurement , the expectation value of @xmath44 for particle b becomes @xmath45 \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{lcl }      0 & { \\rm for } & \\rho = |\\psi\\rangle \\langle \\psi| , \\\\",
    "\\hbar/4 & { \\rm for } & \\rho = |\\psi'\\rangle \\langle \\psi'| .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{expsigbz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath38 and @xmath46 under different local operations on particle a by alice will give different expectation values @xmath47 of particle b at bob s place right after the qndsv , even if @xmath38 and @xmath46 are both separable . if such a measurement were allowed by nature , using an ensemble of @xmath38 alice would be able to send superluminal binary signals to bob by encoding her information in the local operations @xmath48 and @xmath39 .",
    "where is the superluminal signaling coming into play in this example with all the states involved separable ?",
    "if there is no measurement ever performed at @xmath19 , then bob will find the expectation value of @xmath49 equal to the one taken after a complete orthogonal measurement with the post - ms @xmath50 where @xmath51 are eigenstates of @xmath52 in arbitrary direction with eigenvalues @xmath53 , no matter what alice has done on particle a. but now the above qndsv measurement at @xmath19 enforces @xmath38 to collapse to either @xmath43 or a state orthogonal to it in the hilbert space .",
    "so the result ( [ expsigbz ] ) is equivalent to the one taken after a complete orthogonal measurement with the post - ms @xmath54 one can see that some nonlocal information has been put in by the qndsv : when the outcome of particle a is up ( @xmath55 ) , particle b _ must _ be in an eigenstate of @xmath56 , and when the outcome of particle a is down ( @xmath57 ) , particle b can be in an eigenstate of @xmath49 ( or @xmath58 in any direction ) .",
    "it is this outcome - operator dependence producing a discrimination between @xmath55 and @xmath57 when bob is taking @xmath59 locally .",
    "similar post - ms have been applied to the discussions on the  quantum nonlocality without entanglement \" @xcite .",
    "an r - nonlocal quantum state - verification measurement without nondemolition , either without fixing any of the post - ms , or with all of the orthgonal post - ms fixed , may still respect causality @xcite .",
    "the lesson here is that if the number of the projection operators in describing a measurement process in a composite system is less than the dimension of the hilbert space of the total system , and at least one of the post - ms is fixed but not all , then we may be able to construct a protocol which violates causality using this description of measurement .",
    "indeed , similar situations arise in the projective measurements of r - nonlocal variables with degenerate eigenstates .",
    "consider the same two - spin system held by alice and bob and write the total spin of the system as @xmath60 , which is an r - nonlocal variable since particles a and b are separated at a distance . for the operator @xmath61 , the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath62 are @xmath63 and for the operator @xmath64 ,",
    "the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath65 are @xmath66 here both the variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 are q - local because in the hilbert space of the two - spin system the states living in the subspace spanned by the degenerate eigenstates of each variable ( associated with @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) are not affected by the measurement of that variable .",
    "the eigenstates ( [ eigens2 ] ) can be viewed as the post - ms for a qndsv of the singlet state @xmath71 .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the ideal measurement of @xmath72 can violate causality if particles a and b are separated at a distance .",
    "below is an example given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "suppose the system is prepared in the state @xmath73 .",
    "if alice chooses to do nothing on particle a before the measurement of @xmath72 at @xmath74 , then from ( [ eigens2 ] ) the measurement of @xmath72 will collapse the system to the post - ms @xmath75 yielding @xmath76 right after @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "if alice chooses to flip the spin of particle a right before @xmath19 so that the pre - ms becomes @xmath77 , then the measurement will collapse the system to one of the post - ms , @xmath78 which gives @xmath79 right after @xmath19 .",
    "thus , by looking at @xmath80 right after the measurement , bob will be able to know whether alice has flipped @xmath81 right before @xmath19 , no matter how far alice and bob are apart .",
    "this allows superluminal signaling and violates causality .",
    "one resolution is to accept that the projective measurement of the r - nonlocal variable @xmath67 of two spatially separated spins may simply be forbidden by the causality principle . to measure such kind of the r - nonlocal variables one may have to introduce an ancillary entangled pair of spatially localized qubits as probes to interact with particles @xmath82 and @xmath83 locally in space and time .",
    "after the local interactions were done , the information originally in particles a and b was carried by the probes which were then brought together and measured at the same spacetime point to retrieve the nonlocal information of the two - spin system @xcite .",
    "it takes time to bring these information carriers together and so the whole process is causal .    while this resolution works well , an ambiguity in the composite systems leads us to an alternative resolution : even if particles a and b are located at the same space point , once they are _ distinguishable _ particles with spins being the only degrees of freedom quantized , and once the pre - ms of them is not any eigenstate of a variable with degeneracy , the post - ms of the measurement of that variable can be ambiguous due to the degeneracy and the expectation values of certain operators taken after the measurement of that variable can be inconsistent .",
    "for example , if the pre - ms is @xmath84 , then after a projective measurement of @xmath67 , the system may be collapsed to the following set of the post - ms , @xmath85 or another possible set of the post - ms , @xmath86 since @xmath87 are also eigenstates of @xmath72 with @xmath69 , as good as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "both sets of the post - ms give @xmath90 before and after the measurement as expected , but @xmath91 for the post - ms in ( [ s2pms1 ] ) , which is inconsistent with the result @xmath92 for ( [ s2pms2 ] ) ( both are inconsistent with @xmath93 for the pre - ms , anyway ) .",
    "a similar ambiguity will still occur if the variable @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath64 in the above example .",
    ", if the post - ms with @xmath94 are fixed to be @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then @xmath97 after the measurement of @xmath68 . if they are @xmath98 instead , then @xmath99 after the measurement .",
    "similar ambiguity also happens to @xmath100 or @xmath101 after a naive ideal measurement of @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "] such an ambiguity is relevant to the distinguishability of the particles and irrelevant to the r - nonlocality . to eliminate this ambiguity",
    ", one has to specify every element in the set of the post - ms even some of them have degenerate outcomes .    for two spin - particles located at the same space point",
    ", it seems that no purely theoretical principle but experimental results can tell which set of the post - ms would be the right choice .",
    "fortunately if the two particles can be separated in the position space , causality may serve as a guiding principle for theorists to select .",
    "indeed , one may insist both @xmath72 and @xmath64 are able to be described in von neumann s prescription , and the post - ms of @xmath72 must be one of the following states : @xmath104 with no linear combination of the above three states with @xmath69 being allowed , while the post - ms of @xmath64 must be one of the following states : @xmath105 with all linear combinations of @xmath95 and @xmath96 being forbidden @xcite",
    ". then @xmath106 will be independent of alice s local operation before the measurement .",
    "in fact , ( [ pmss2 ] ) and ( [ pmssz ] ) are the only two types of the post - ms set respecting causality in a two - spin system , as shown in @xcite .",
    "either ( [ pmss2 ] ) or ( [ pmssz ] ) forms a complete set of the projection operators called the complete semicausal measurement superoperators in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the criterion for such operators in a bipartite qm system to respect causality in the above setup has been given . for example , when the state of particle a is traced out , all the four projection operators constructed by the four post - ms in ( [ pmss2 ] ) yield the same reduced projection operators for particle b as @xmath107 .",
    "this satisfies the sufficient and necessary condition for the corresponding measurement being ( semi-)causal .",
    "restricting the post - ms to be ( [ pmss2 ] ) or ( [ pmssz ] ) eliminates the ambiguity of the post - ms with degenerate eigenstates as well as the possibility of superluminal signaling in the r - nonlocal measurements .",
    "in such a resolution quantum states in the whole hilbert space will be affected by the r - nonlocal measurement .",
    "in other words , the ideal measurements of r - nonlocal variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 have to be q - nonlocal .",
    "note that , in contrast to the conventional r - local measurement , if bob has the knowledge about the initial state of the two - spin system , he will be able to know which kind of the r - nonlocal measurement has been performed by the external agent : for the initial state @xmath88 , if the operator associated with the r - nonlocal measurement at @xmath19 was @xmath72 , then bob would find @xmath108 at @xmath109 ; if it was @xmath64 , or there was no measurement has ever performed , then @xmath110 .",
    "to respect causality , we have to further assume that the external agent has no information to send to bob ( or alice ) in choosing the r - nonlocal measurement .",
    "to get closer to the r - nonlocal projective measurement on bosonic fields , let us consider a pair of the point - like objects whose internal degrees of freedom @xmath111 and @xmath112 act as two quantum mechanical harmonic oscillators ( ho ) in 1d with the same natural frequency @xmath113 and mass @xmath114 .",
    "again we assume these two dstinguishable objects are held by alice and bob separated in space .",

    "here @xmath122 are real - number parameters and @xmath123 are energy eigenstates of ho with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 the hermite polynomials . at @xmath15",
    ", alice gives a  kick \" to @xmath111 by applying a unitary operator @xmath127 to the initial state , i.e. , shift @xmath128 by amount @xmath31 freely chosen by alice , then the pre - ms right before the measurement reads @xmath129 \\left [ e^{i\\lambda_- q_-/\\sqrt{2}\\hbar}\\psi^{}_0(q_- )   \\right ] \\label{psiinho}\\ ] ] with @xmath130 .",
    "consider an r - nonlocal measurements of the number operator @xmath131 for @xmath115 , where @xmath132 with the lowering operators @xmath133 commutes with the hamiltonian of the two ho .",
    "naively , since ( [ psiinho ] ) is a separable state in terms of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , one may follow the same rule in the r - local measurements @xcite that only the @xmath115 part of the pre - ms ( [ psiinho ] ) is projected so that the post - ms has the form @xmath134 for some non - negative integer @xmath135 .",
    "( below we call the q - local measurements corresponding to this kind of the post - ms as the _ naive _ ideal measurements of r - nonlocal variables . ) then ( [ naivepms ] ) gives @xmath136 , which depends on @xmath31 chosen by the free will of alice and so violates causality .",
    "learning from the previous sections , to eliminate the dependence of @xmath31 and get rid of the superluminal signaling , one may further restrict the post - ms to be one of the complete orthonormal basis @xmath137 with some quantum numbers @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "then the pre - ms can be expanded as @xmath140 with all the @xmath31-dependence contained in the coefficient @xmath141 , and the expectation values of bob s local variables @xmath142 after measurement reads @xmath143 where @xmath144 to make @xmath145 independent of @xmath31 , one possibility is that @xmath146 are evenly distributed in positive and negative values , as occured in the two - spin case with the post - ms ( [ pmssz ] ) and the operator @xmath147 .",
    "a simpler situation is that for every operator @xmath142 bob has a constant finite value of @xmath146 independent of @xmath138 and @xmath139 whenever @xmath148 , as in the two - spin case with the post - ms ( [ pmss2 ] ) and the operator @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath31-dependence on bob s side is erased since @xmath149 after the constant @xmath150 is factored out of the sum .",
    "unfortunately in the ideal measurement of @xmath131 on the two - ho system both the above two situations are not easy to achieve .",
    "for example , if one chooses the post - ms as the basis @xmath151 , while the expectation values @xmath152 , one has @xmath153 and @xmath154 proportional to @xmath155 , so that @xmath156 and @xmath157 depend on @xmath31 explicitly .    an alternative strategy is to make those @xmath146 which depends on @xmath138 or @xmath139 diverge to wash out the @xmath31-dependence .",
    "this suggests that if @xmath158 is an eigenstate of the r - nonlocal variable @xmath159 , then @xmath160 can be something like an eigenstate of the variable conjugate to @xmath161 .",

    "then the excitation number of @xmath116 becomes totally uncertain and the coefficients @xmath171 in the expansion ( [ psiinalbe ] ) read @xmath172 with @xmath173 , and right after the measurement , @xmath174 since @xmath175 for all @xmath135 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",

    "thus the @xmath31-dependence can not be observed by bob .",

    "one may say causality is respected down to the order of @xmath255 , which depends on the uv cutoff of the field in ( 3 + 1)d minkowski space and/or the spatial resolution of the apparatus . for single modes , causality violation of @xmath30 in ( [ result1rev ] )",

    "we conclude that the qndsv of an one - particle state of a field mode in rqft respects causality effectively .",
    "we have studied the nonlocal projective measurements in the qm systems with two localized objects held by alice and bob separated in the position space , and in a rqft system where alice and bob can operate the local degrees of freedom at their own positions .",
    "the general setting is that alice performs a local operation on one element located at her position right before the nonlocal measurement on the composite system , then bob observes the expectation values of another element located at his position right after the nonlocal measurement .    in qm",
    ", naive extensions of the von neumann s projective measurement can produce superluminal signaling in this setup and so violate causality both in the qndsv and the ideal measurements of r - nonlocal variables .",
    "we showed that in a qm two - spin system , the qndsv violates causality even if both the pre - ms and the to - be - verified state of the two spins are separable states in terms of the r - local variables .",
    "such causality violation is due to the ",
    "nonlocality without entanglement \" , which is possible when the number of projection operators in the process is less than the dimension of the hilbert space .    the ideal measurements of r - nonlocal variables in the two - spin or two - ho qm system can be made causal by introducing further restrictions on the post - ms , so that the expectation values of all combinations of bob s local dynamical variables for each post - ms are either zero or infinity .",
    "this makes the measurement q - nonlocal and eliminates all the information originally in the pre - ms before measurement , so that bob can know whether the r - nonlocal measurement was done or not from his observation .",
    "nevertheless , in realistic systems consisting of spatially localized ho , causality under the ideal measurements of r - nonlocal variables would only be respected up to some level determined by the cutoffs of the theory . in rqft",
    "the situation appears similar .",
    "causality violation also arises formally in a similar setup , and could be eliminated by introducing further restrictions on the post - ms .",
    "however , the causality - violating terms in bob s results obtained right after a naive r - nonlocal but q - local ideal measurement on a single mode are suppressed by the ir cutoff of the field theory , and thus virtually undetectable . causality violation by the qndsv in rqft is further suppressed by the uv cutoff .",
    "it turns out that rqft is more tolerant to the naive ideal measurement of r - nonlocal variables than qm is . a field theory with the quantum field defined in an infinitely large spacetime",
    "will be effectively causal with the naive r - nonlocal projective measurement included .",
    "recall that in classical electrodynamics there exist acausal solutions for the motion of a point charge in electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , once the length - scale is no smaller than the classical electron radius or the time - resolution is no shorter than @xmath257 @xcite , formal causality violation will not be observed and so the theory is effectively causal .",
    ", however , the uv cutoff has to be high enough , and for the ideal measurement in section [ idealfield ] , the ir cutoff has to be low enough to suppress causality violation . ] for quantum fields , the same idea applies . in the cases studied in the present paper , infinitely many degrees of freedom and continuous spectrum of rqft help to protect causality in effective theories , though the setup looks similar to the counterpart in qm which suffers significant superluminal signals .",
