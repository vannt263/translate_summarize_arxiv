    "about 50 stellar - mass black holes have been discovered and about two dozen of these have been well studied at optical or radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "they are all accretion - powered x - ray sources located in x - ray binary systems . in each system",
    ", the x - ray source is fueled by gas that feeds from a mass - donor star into the black hole s accretion disk . within a few hundred kilometers of the black hole ,",
    "the gas reaches a temperature of @xmath5  k and produces a luminosity that can approach the eddington limit ( @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "more than 80% of such sources are transient , with outbursts lasting a year or so followed by years or decades of quiescence .",
    "typically , the host binaries have short orbital periods ( @xmath8  day ) and are comprised of a low - mass ( @xmath9 ) secondary star and a @xmath10 black hole . presently , neither the masses nor the orbital period of our featured system , h1743322 , are known .",
    "nevertheless , as we now describe , the wealth of data available for h1743322 ( hereafter h1743 ) strongly indicates that it is a typical short - period black hole transient .",
    "studies of x - ray spectral and timing data leave little doubt that h1743 contains a black hole primary @xcite , notwithstanding the lack of dynamical evidence . while large outbursts of h1743 occurred in 1977 , 2003 and 2008",
    ", our focus here is on the major 2003 outburst . during this 9-month active period , h1743",
    "was observed 170 times using the pca and hexte detectors aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) @xcite .",
    "the source exhibited two distinct phases of evolution : ( 1 ) during the first three months ( when the source was observed on an almost daily basis ) h1743 flared continually and violently and was in the steep power - law ( spl ) or intermediate ( spl : hard ) state ( see @xcite for discussion of these x - ray states ) . on the 47th day of outburst ( mjd 52766 ) ,",
    "an event of central importance occurred  the radio / x - ray jets we model were launched during an intense power - law flare ( discussed below ) .",
    "( 2 ) during the next four months , the source was locked in the thermal dominant ( td ) state , and the source intensity decayed smoothly and monotonically .",
    "it is primarily these td - state data that we use to determine the spin of h1743 .",
    "an important x - ray timing result derived from the 2003 outburst was the discovery of a pair of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at 240  hz and 165  hz @xcite .",
    "similar high - frequency ( hf ) qpos with a commensurate frequency ratio of 3:2 are seen for three other dynamically - confirmed black holes ( xte j1550564 , gro j165540 and grs 1915 + 105 ) .",
    "about one year after the onset of the 2003 outburst , bipolar x - ray jets were discovered and observed a total of three times using _",
    "chandra  _",
    "radio observations , which commenced several months before the x - ray observations , resulted in four detections of the eastern jet ( only ) , followed about two months later by a single detection of the western jet @xcite .",
    "large - scale x - ray jets are rare , having been previously observed for only one other microquasar , namely xte j1550564 , which is similar in many respects to h1743 ( for comparisons , see @xcite ) . in its 1998 outburst ,",
    "xte j1550564 produced relativistic jets at early times whose launch date was unambiguously tied to the occurrence of a remarkable x - ray flare ( @xcite ) .",
    "h1743 s x - flare on mjd 52766 showed striking similarities to the giant flare of xte j1550564 ( see figure 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "of particular note , both flares occurred during a dip in the x - ray rms power ( 0.110 hz ) , a jump in frequency of the low - frequency qpos , onset of the high - frequency qpos , and the apex of power - law emission @xcite .",
    "the similar character of these two flares , and the coincidence for xte j1550564 between the x - ray flare and the launch date of the jets , motivated us to search the vla archive for additional observations of h1743 .",
    "this search was fruitful , and in section  [ section : data ] we report three additional radio jet detections at early times that link the jets to the 2003 x - ray flare .",
    "to deduce the source distance and jet inclination angle of h1743 , we model the proper - motion data derived from the x - ray and radio observations . in doing so",
    ", we closely follow our recent study of the large - scale x - ray / radio jets of xte j1550564 @xcite , which builds on the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite . using a model originally applied to gamma - ray bursts",
    ", we concluded that xte j1550564 is embedded in a pc - scale cavity in which the jets expanded unimpeded until they impacted the cavity walls and rapidly decelerated .",
    "we apply this same model to h1743 and obtain constraints on the distance and jet inclination angle ( presumed to be the inclination of the spin axis ; see @xcite ) .    the evolution of h1743 s jets",
    "have already been studied by @xcite ; however , our aims differ from theirs .",
    "they were primarily interested in the environment of the black hole .",
    "while assuming an earlier launch date for the jets , they adopted the nominal values of distance and inclination ( @xmath11  kpc and @xmath12 ) suggested by @xcite .",
    "our attention is focused on deriving accurate constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath14 for h1743 , which we use in turn to constrain the spin of the black hole with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the black hole mass and angular momentum . ] .",
    "we measure the spin of h1743 using the continuum - fitting ( cf ) method @xcite . in the cf method ,",
    "one estimates the inner radius of the accretion disk @xmath18 , which is identified with the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath19 .",
    "knowing both @xmath19 and @xmath16 is equivalent to knowing the spin parameter @xmath20 because @xmath21 is a monotonic function of @xmath20 , decreasing from 6 to 1 as the spin parameter increases from 0 to 1 @xcite . ] . in the cf method , one determines @xmath19 by modeling the x - ray continuum spectrum of the dominant thermal component using a fully relativistic model of a thin accretion disk .",
    "the observables are x - ray flux , temperature , distance @xmath13 , inclination @xmath14 , and mass @xmath16 . in order to obtain reliable values of @xmath20 , it is essential to select x - ray spectra that have a strong thermal component and to have accurate estimates of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 . for h1743 , we use our jet model to determine the first two parameters , and we constrain @xmath16 using the known distribution of black hole masses for x - ray transient sources .",
    "to search for the presence of radio jets near the time of their expected production ( section  [ section : intro ] ) , we examined high spatial resolution a - configuration vla images taken early during h1743 s 2003 outburst ( see @xcite ) . calibrated data from the vla archive for program ar523 on mjd 52779.4 , 52782.4 , and 52786.4 were imaged using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) task imagr .",
    "the source was detected at 8.4 and 14.9 ghz , but here we only use the 14.9 ghz data , which had sufficient angular resolution to clearly resolve source components . the synthesized beam was approximately @xmath22 by @xmath23 elongated north - south .",
    "fortunately , the jet position angle is almost exactly east - west @xcite , allowing us to identify components separated by @xmath24 . at all",
    "three epochs , the source displayed a dominant component and a weak component offset towards the west . at mjd 52779.4 ,",
    "just 13 days after h1743 s x - ray flare , their separation was @xmath25 mas .",
    "later , on mjd 52782.4 and mjd 52786.4 the separations were @xmath26 mas and @xmath27 mas , respectively .",
    "the majority of the jet data considered in our analysis are taken from tables  1 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "these tables provide jet - source separation measurements for radio and x - ray observations which were conducted from 6 months onward following h1743 s jet - launching flare .",
    "the x - ray data consist of three @xmath28  ks _ chandra _ x - ray observations in which both jets were detected . in radio ,",
    "@xcite report on five observations from the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the eastern jet was present in each image , but the western jet was detected only in the final observation .",
    "these x - ray and radio observations were carried out between mjd 52955 and mjd 53092 , when the jet - source separations were in the range @xmath29 .",
    "the substantially larger angular separations of the eastern jet indicate that it is approaching and the western jet is receding .    in determining the spin of h1743",
    ", we analyze the full set of _ rxte _",
    "pcu-2 `` standard 2 '' data obtained during the 2003 outburst , with the spectra binned into 170 half - day intervals .",
    "these spectra have been modeled in detail by @xcite and @xcite , and we use the same data reduction procedures here . briefly , all the data are dead - time corrected , background subtracted , and analyzed with the inclusion of a 1% systematic uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we standardize all detector calibrations to the @xcite values for the crab using a custom model which adjusts both the overall flux normalization and the spectral shape ( see @xcite ) . during the early weeks of the outburst cycle , _ rxte _ s pointing was offset by @xmath30 from h1743 .",
    "we have corrected the fluxes to the full collimator transmission by assuming a triangular response with fwhm = @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our jet model , which is based on one developed by @xcite , was first applied in describing gamma - ray - bursts . here , we consider a pair of symmetric jets , each ejected with an initial kinetic energy @xmath32 and lorentz factor @xmath33 . during their expansion ,",
    "the jets decelerate as they sweep up gas in their paths . assuming adiabatic expansion , the evolution of each jet is governed by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath36 the mass of the ejecta , @xmath37 is a numerical factor of order unity ranges from 0.35 in the ultrarelativistic limit to 0.73 in the nonrelativistic limit . for additional details concerning our model ,",

    "is constrained by its prior at large values , but the other parameters show little dependence on their priors . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=334 ]    our full model requires just five parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath45 , @xmath33 , the launch date @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , the effective energy .",
    "following our approach for xte j1550564 @xcite , we scale @xmath41 and @xmath42 using typical values , with density 100 times lower than for the interstellar medium . ] . because of the association with the x - ray flare ,",
    "the prior on the launch date is taken to be mjd @xmath51 days ; we adopt a flat prior on @xmath45 , @xmath13 , log(@xmath33 ) , and log(@xmath50 ) .",
    "our model is fitted via a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routine developed using the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite which has been previously applied with this jet model in @xcite .",
    "the chains are evolved until they are well converged , using @xmath52 elements total chain elements , which were generated during training and burn - in phases , were not used . ] .    from the vla data alone , the identification of the pair of radio sources is ambiguous .",
    "we have applied our model by attributing to the two radio sources each allowed combination of eastern jet , western jet , and core .",
    "the most probable interpretation is that the two sources correspond to emission from the core and the western jet .",
    "alternative pairings are ruled out at @xmath53 confidence by our model .",
    "the best fit achieved by the mcmc run is shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] and reaches a goodness of fit @xmath54 . obviously , further modification to the model is not needed and @xmath13 are unchanged . ] . distributions for the model parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] . of chief importance",
    ", we find that distance and inclination are well constrained : @xmath55  kpc and @xmath56 .",
    "this distance places h1743 near the galactic center , which is expected , given its projected separation of only @xmath57 from the galactic center .",
    "the time at which the jets were produced is constrained to @xmath58mjd @xmath59 days , independent of the prior .",
    "this timing supports a connection between h1743 s x - ray flare and the production of its jets .",
    "the speed of the jets , @xmath33 , has a relatively low maximum a posteriori estimate , @xmath60 , but is poorly constrained at high values and tracks its prior . for the kinematic energy of each jet , we obtain a large uncertainty of @xmath61 dex centered around @xmath62  erg .",
    "this implies that h1743 s jets are only about a tenth as energetic as those produced in the 1998 outburst of xte j1550564 or , alternatively , for h1743 either ( 1 ) the density of the surrounding medium is much lower or ( 2 ) the jet opening angle is substantially smaller .",
    "we now estimate the spin of h1743 by fitting its x - ray spectra . for the three crucial input parameters , we use the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 derived in the preceding section and the distribution of black hole masses discussed below .",
    "all of our analysis is performed using xspec v12.7.0 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and making minor adjustments , our spectral model has the form tbabs(simpl@xmath63kerrbb2 ) , where tbabs and kerrbb2 are , respectively , the low - energy - absorption and accretion - disk components .",
    "the component simpl  scatters a fraction of the thermal disk photons into a compton power law . for h1743",
    ", this simple convolution model describes only the broad continuum components and is unaffected by the inclusion of weaker features due , e.g. , to warm absorbers or spectral reflection .",
    "the four free parameters of the spectral model is frozen at 2.0@xmath64 @xcite .",

    "mass , inclination , and distance are varied in @xmath67 monte - carlo samples , and all 170 spectra are fitted for each setting .",
    "uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the x - ray flux is accounted for by randomly varying the overall flux normalization by 10% for each triplet setting of @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we similarly marginalize over uncertainty in the viscosity parameter @xmath68 by randomly assigning either @xmath69 or @xmath70 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are two representative values available to our model . both of these uncertainties have a small effect on @xmath20 compared to our dominant uncertainty , the unknown black hole mass .",
    "( uncertainty in the mass accounts for 50% of our final uncertainty in @xmath20 . )",

    "typically , about 30 spectra pass this screening .",
    "finally , each of the @xmath67 samples is given a weight according to the mass distribution assumed , and random draws are made from the selected spectra to achieve an estimate of spin .",

    "we also find that extreme values of spin are ruled out ; @xmath4 at 99.7% confidence .",
    "this makes h1743 one of a growing population of black hole microquasars known to have moderate spin ( e.g. , a062000 , @xmath81 ; @xcite , xte j1550564 , @xmath82 ; @xcite ) .    in figure",

    ", we fitted all 170 x - ray spectra collected during the 2003 outburst of h1743 , applied our data selection criteria , and derived a relationship between spin and black hole mass .",
    "we then constrained the mass of h1743 using an analytic distribution for transient systems that are similar to h1743 , thereby arriving at our final result : @xmath2 ( @xmath88 at 90% confidence ) .",
    "meanwhile , we rule strongly against an extreme value of spin : @xmath4 at 99.7% confidence .",
    "two similar microquasars have been identified which also produced powerful jets while harboring black holes with moderate spins : a062000 ( @xmath89 ; @xcite ) and j1550564 ( @xmath82 ; @xcite ) .",
