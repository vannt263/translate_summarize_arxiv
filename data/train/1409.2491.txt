    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) exhibit complex temporal evolution , which is unique for each grb . while gamma rays are produced in relativistic outflows far from the central engine that powers the jet , the observed temporal variation of the emission is likely connected to the activity of the central engine itself ( e.g. , @xcite ) . interpreting the temporal variation of the emission may therefore be essential in understanding the origin of grbs and their environments .",
    "grb emission often does not appear to be continuous .",
    "in many cases , episodes of emission are separated by quiescent intervals during which the gamma - ray flux drops below the observed background level .",
    "the reason for this separation is not currently clear",
    ". it could be due to ( i ) different mechanisms being responsible for the separate emission periods , ( ii ) a temporary halt in the activity of the central engine , or ( iii ) a continuous central engine with greatly varying output that can , for periods , fall below the detectable level , e.g. , due to modulation of the velocity of the relativistic outflow @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have aimed to characterize the statistical properties of distinct emission episodes .",
    "many of them focused on the so - called _ precursor _ activity , often defined as emission preceding the episode that has the highest peak intensity ( main event ) , from which it is separated by a quiescent period with no detectable gamma - ray flux .",
    "the search for such precursors is motivated in part by theoretical models predicting a distinct emission episode prior to the main burst .",
    "however , the models typically predict one separate episode and can not account for the more than two emission periods found for some grbs .",
    "( for a brief review of theoretical models for precursor emission see @xcite . ) @xcite [ hereafter k95 ] searched for precursors in a sample of grbs detected by batse in the first 3 years of its operation .",
    "they required that a precursor is followed by a quiescent interval at least as long as the duration of the main burst .",
    "they found precursor activity in @xmath33% of the grbs .",
    "they identified significant correlation between the duration of the precursor and the duration of the main event , although this correlation was not confirmed by the subsequent studies . beyond this correlation",
    ", they concluded that the characteristics of the main emission episode are independent of the presence of the precursor .",
    "later , @xcite [ hereafter l05 ] relaxed the requirement for minimum quiescence and searched for precursors the flux of which decay before the onset of the main event .",
    "he looked for dim emission that did not trigger the grb detector in a sample of long and bright grbs detected by batse , and identified precursors in @xmath320% of the sample .",
    "he found precursor spectra to be softer than those of the main bursts .",
    "@xcite [ hereafter b08 ] looked for precursors in grbs detected by swift that had known redshifts .",
    "they detected precursors in @xmath315% of them and found no significant difference between the spectral properties of precursors and main events .",
    "subsequently , [ b09 ] searched for precursor activity in the entire batse catalog and studied their spectral evolution .",
    "they identified precursors in @xmath312% , and found that their properties are similar to those of the main emission episode .",
    "they concluded that precursor and main emission episodes probably arise from the same fireball mechanism .",
    "more recently , @xcite focused on a small sample of short grbs , as well as the subset of short grbs with extended emission , detected by swift .",
    "they identified precursor activity in @xmath310% of the short grbs , with precursor and main emission showing no substantial difference .",
    "they discussed a number of distinct emission mechanisms that could result in precursor emission preceding a short grb .",
    "other authors studied isolated emission episodes to examine the activity of the central engine during quiescent periods .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggested that grb afterglow observations could be used to determine whether the central engine was dormant during these periods .",
    "@xcite found that the duration of a quiescent interval and the duration of the subsequent emission episode are correlated , but found no correlation with the emission prior to the quiescent time .",
    "they associated this correlation with a meta - stable energy _",
    "build - up _",
    "i.e. the longer this energy accumulates , the more energy is available to produce the burst following the quiescent time .    in this paper , we present a search for isolated emission episodes over a set of 2710 grbs .",
    "we employ a fully automated search that identifies emission episodes in the time - frequency domain , allowing the analysis of a large set of bursts , while avoiding human bias .",
    "we use detections by the fermi , swift and batse missions to maximize our data set and to allow for comparisons with previous results .",

    "we note that the maximum identified quiescent interval is limited by the available length of the time series .",
    "quiescent intervals of comparable duration ( and longer ) are identified in some of the so - called ultra long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we note that some of the ultra - long grbs were included in our search ; however , part of their emission fell outside of the analyzed intervals around the trigger time ] .    in several cases ,",
    "pre / post - peak emission episodes fall outside the nominal @xmath1 of the burst .",

    "we note that the probability of falsely identifying a background feature as an emission episode is independent of the feature s peak time ( i.e. the probability is the same regardless of the temporal separation from the main event ) and thus the expected distribution of @xmath9 for false positives is uniform .",
    "we can therefore use the fraction of emission episodes at the farthest bin from the main event to set an upper limit on the false alarm rate of our search .",

    "we did not find any significant correlation in any of the samples , consistent with the results of previous precursor studies .",
    "the properties of the post - peak events are also uncorrelated with the properties of the main event .",
    "one interesting finding is that pre / post - peak emission episodes carry a significant fraction of the total photon count of the bursts .",
    "@xcite found that the duration of a quiescent period and the duration of the subsequent emission episode are correlated .",
    "to investigate this effect , we looked for correlations between the quiescent interval ( @xmath7 ) and the duration of the events before and after quiescence .",
    "the duration of the main event as well as the duration of the identified isolated emission episodes are uncorrelated with the quiescent interval between the events .",
    "finally , we checked if there is any correlation between the quiescent interval between successive episodes ( without differentiating between pre - peak emission , main event and post - peak emission ) and the duration of the previous or the following emission episode .",

    "we employed an automated identification method for an unbiased , large scale search .",
    "for the first time , a search for isolated emission episodes before the main event included grbs detected by the gbm on the fermi satellite .",
    "the search also included isolated emission episodes after the main event .",
    "for the first time , grbs detected by different instruments were analyzed systematically with a common algorithm .",
    "our findings from the analysis of three large datasets are summarized as follows :    * a significant percentage of grbs ( @xmath1210% ) show pre - peak activity .",
    "the percentage is similar in all three samples and is consistent with previous searches that employed a similar definition of precursors ( b08/b09 ) . *",
    "post - peak activity was detected in a comparable , albeit slightly higher , fraction of grbs @xmath1215% . *",
    "the temporal properties ( duration , peak flux , number of photons ) of pre - peak and post - peak emission seem to be uncorrelated with the properties of the main event .",
    "they are scattered around the properties of the main burst , but no systematic trend was observed . *",
    "pre - peak and post - peak events carry a significant fraction of the total photons of the grb , regardless of the separation time of the two events . *",
    "isolated emission episodes are separated from the main event by long quiescent intervals that extend at least up to @xmath3700s . *",
    "the properties of pre / post - peak episodes and the properties of the main event do no appear to be correlated to the duration of the quiescent interval .",
    "future additions to the presented analysis include the application of our automated search to identify isolated emission episodes in short grbs . to resolve the temporal structure of short grbs , light curves with time resolution shorter than the bursts variability timescales are necessary , along with a frequency band extended to higher frequencies .",
    "moreover , we will extend the catalog to incorporate grbs detected by the interplanetary network ( ipn ; @xcite ) .",
    "it will also be interesting to use the analysis to study ultra - long grbs .",
    "for instance , the distribution of the temporal properties of these grbs ( total duration or duration of quiescent intervals ) , may be informative on whether they have distinct progenitors from regular long grbs ( e.g. , long separations between emission episodes have been interpreted as outliers in the distribution of quiescent intervals that possibly indicate a different underlying mechanism ; @xcite ; ) .    the algorithm developed here",
    "is also suited for a robust statistical detection of untriggered grbs and potentially ultra - long grbs that were not identified .",
    "we note that we efficiently detected emission episodes that did not trigger the relevant detectors .",
