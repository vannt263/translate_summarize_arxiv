    "two - dimensional phase unwrapping is an essential component in a majority of techniques used for quantitative phase imaging .",
    "a typical example of standard application is tomographic phase microscopy  @xcite , where the phase of the transmitted wave - field must be first unwrapped before being interpreted as a line integral of the refractive index along the direction of propagation .",
    "phase unwrapping is also used for estimation of terrain elevation in synthetic aperture radar  @xcite , wave / fat separation in magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite , and estimation of wave - front distortion in adaptive optics  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , improvements in phase unwrapping methodology can enhance the applicability and outreach of techniques that rely on quantitative phase evaluation .",
    "the centrality of phase unwrapping has resulted in the development of many practical solutions to the problem .",
    "such solutions include direct approaches based on path - following such as the two - dimensional extension of the well known itoh s method  @xcite as well as more evolved strategies based on branch cuts  @xcite or quality maps  @xcite .",
    "the current trend in the literature is to formulate the task of phase unwrapping as an inverse problem in a path - independent way .",
    "earlier works have proposed to minimize the quadratic error between the true and wrapped phase differences  @xcite .",
    "marroquin and rivera  @xcite have applied tikhonov regularization to improve and stabilize the performance of the least - squares approach .",
    "they showed that the introduction of the regularization term permits the algorithm to cope with noise and missing data .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the performance of phase unwrapping is further improved when replacing tikhonov with total - variation regularization . in the context of phase",
    "unwrapping , ghiglia and romero  @xcite recognized the tendency of quadratic - penalty to smooth image edges and proposed to minimize a more general @xmath0 norm  based criterion as an alternative .",
    "they found that the performance of phase unwrapping improves when @xmath1 , albeit at the increase in computational cost .",
    "similarly , rivera and marroquin  @xcite have investigated nonconvex optimization strategies relying on half - quadratic regularization .",
    "more recently , gonzlez and jacques  @xcite have proposed an iterative unwrapping method based on @xmath2 minimization that additionally promotes sparsity of the solution in the wavelet domain .",

    ", we propose a new variational - reconstruction approach for phase unwrapping that is robust to noise .",
    "in particular , our aim is to improve on state of the art by introducing an improved energy functional and demonstrating its benefits .",
    "the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * formulation of the unwrapping as an optimization problem where the data - fidelity term penalizes the weighted @xmath2-norm of the error in a way that is invariant to rotations .",
    "our formulation thus allows the phase image to contain edges that are of arbitrary orientation , which is distinct from traditional approaches in literature  @xcite . * use of a non - quadratic regularization term that allows our method to cope with noise , while still preserving sharp edges in the phase image .",
    "our regularizer consists of a higher - order extension of total - variation ( tv ) that is currently considered state of the art in the context of resolution of linear inverse problems in biomedical imaging  @xcite .",
    "* design of a novel iterative algorithm for phase unwrapping .",
    "the algorithm approximates the minimum @xmath3-norm solution by solving a sequence of weighted @xmath2-norm minimization problems , where the weights at the next iteration are computed from the value of the current solution .",
    "since our energy functional is non - smooth , we rely on a well known alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm )  @xcite to decompose the minimization into a sequence of simpler operations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : problem ] , we introduce our formulation of the phase unwrapping , and discuss the relevance of this new approach for obtaining high - quality solutions in practice . in section",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] , we derive our reconstruction algorithm . in section  [ sec : experiments ] , we conduct experiments on simulated and real phase unwrapping problems , and compare our method with the state of the art from both qualitative and quantitative standpoints . we summarize and conclude our work in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the following observation model @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent vectorized versions of the wrapped and unwrapped phase images , respectively .",
    "the wrapping is represented by a component - wise function @xmath9 that is defined as @xmath10 \\quad\\in\\quad \\left[-\\pi , \\pi\\right).\\ ] ] when noise is part of the measurements , we assume that the unwrapped phase vector @xmath8 in our model represents the noisy version of the true phase @xmath11 .    generally , the two - dimensional phase unwrapping problem is ill - posed .",
    "however , it can be solved exactly in the noiseless scenario , when the phase @xmath8 satisfies the two - dimensional extension of itoh s continuity condition  @xcite .",

    "relation   suggests that two - dimensional phase unwrapping may be accomplished by a simple phase summation , provided that   is satisfied at all pixels @xmath20 .",
    "note that the formulation in   imposes the itoh s continuity condition on both gradient components simultaneously due to the norm inequality @xmath22 which holds for any @xmath23 .    in practice ,",

    ", it can still be expected to hold for the great majority of pixels of the unwrapped phase image .",
    "we thus formulate phase unwrapping as the following minimization problem @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the data - fidelity term and @xmath26 is the regularization term , to be discussed shortly .",
    "the convex set @xmath27 enforces the first pixel of the solution @xmath8 to match the first pixel of the wrapped phase @xmath7 , which removes the additive constant ambiguity present in phase unwrapping .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 controls the amount of regularization .",

    "it can be interpreted as a convex relaxation of @xmath3-norm penalty that enforces sparse magnitudes of @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that our data - term favors @xmath8 whose gradient @xmath21 agrees with @xmath35 on most of the pixels .",
    "moreover , our data - fidelity term @xmath25 penalizes both horizontal @xmath36 and vertical @xmath37 components of @xmath34 in a joint fashion .",
    "this is significantly different from traditional formulations in the literature  @xcite , where the @xmath2-norm is penalized in a separable fashion as @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , there is a clear analogy between our formulation   and the _ isotropic _ , i.e.  rotation invariant , form of total - variation ( tv ) that is often used for edge - preserving image restoration  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the separable @xmath2-penalty @xmath39 is analogous to the _ anisotropic _ form of tv .",
    "the arbitrary orientation of edges in a typical image makes isotropic tv penalty a preferred choice for image restoration .",
    "the numerical experiments presented in sec .  [ sec : experiments ] illustrate that indeed our method based on isotropic formulation can unwrap a larger class of images compared to other state - of - the - art phase unwrapping methods .",
    "it has been reported in several works  @xcite that nonconvex approaches based on @xmath0-norm penalization of @xmath34 , with @xmath40 , further improve the performance of phase unwrapping . in particular , @xmath3-norm is generally accepted as the most desirable in practice .",
    "one of the properties of @xmath2-norm that distinguishes it from @xmath3 is that it takes into account the actual values of the magnitudes of @xmath34 , whereas @xmath3-norm disregards this information and only counts the support .",
    "one possible strategy for selecting weights in the context of @xmath2 minimization proposed by cands _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is to pick @xmath41 such that it counteracts the influence of the magnitude on the @xmath2-norm .",

    "the large values in @xmath41 force the solution @xmath44 to concentrate on the pixels where the weights are small , and by construction these correspond precisely to the pixels where the magnitudes of @xmath34 are nonzero .",
    "typically , these pixels correspond to the area of the phase image that contains a sharp edge .",
    "it is clearly impossible to construct the precise weights   without knowing the unwrapped phase @xmath8 itself , but this suggests more generally that large weights could be used to discourage nonzero magnitudes in @xmath34 , while small weights could be used to encourage nonzero magnitudes in @xmath34 .        as regularization term in",

    ". there are four major advantages of using such hessian schatten - norm ( hs ) regularization :    * as a higher order regularizer hs avoids the staircase effect of tv and results in piecewise - smooth variations of intensity in the reconstructed phase image .",
    "accordingly , this makes hs particularly well suited for biological and medical specimens that consist of complicated structures such as filaments .",
    "* similarly to the data - fidelity term @xmath25 , our regularizer @xmath26 is convex and rotation invariant  @xcite .",
    "rotation invariance implies that we can expect it to work equally well on phase images that contain objects of arbitrary orientations .",
    "* hs regularization has been shown to be state of the art in resolution of linear inverse problems .",
    "in particular , it was shown in  @xcite that hs consistently outperforms other popular regularizers such as tikhonov , wavelet , and tv . *",
    "convexity and its algebraic structure make hs amenable to efficient algorithmic implementation and thus practical for large scale inverse problems that are typical in imaging .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a new technique for two - dimensional phase unwrapping . the unwrapped phase is found as the solution of an inverse problem that consists in the minimization of an energy functional . </S>",
    "<S> the latter includes a weighted data - fidelity term that favors sparsity in the error between the true and wrapped phase differences , as well as a regularizer based on higher - order total - variation . one desirable feature of our method is its rotation invariance , which allows it to unwrap a much larger class of images compared to the state of the art . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several experiments on simulated and real data obtained through the tomographic phase microscope . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method can enhance the applicability and outreach of techniques that rely on quantitative phase evaluation . </S>"
