    "the enhancement of the @xmath3 strength at low energy around the particle - emission threshold of neutron - rich nuclei has been identified as the manifestation of the pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) . in the most intuitive and common interpretation ,",
    "the pdr in a neutron - rich nucleus is represented as the oscillation of the weakly - bound neutron skin against the isospin - symmetric core of protons and neutrons .",
    "the pdr s nature and properties such as its collectivity , the dependence of its energy - weighted sum of strength ( ewss ) have been the subjects of several experimental and theoretical studies in recent years .",
    "( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , for some experimental and theoretical works , respectively . )",
    "these studies reveal that the nature of the so - called pdr is still an issue open to debate .",
    "is the pdr indeed a collective motion to deserve that name or merely composed of non - collective excitations , remnants at the gdr s low - energy tail like those observed in @xmath4o ?",
    "the answers to these questions are currently far from being conclusive . the macroscopic picture , which represents the pdr as a collective oscillation of the neutron excess against the stable core is rather crude .",
    "in particular , when the pdr is strongly coupled to the gdr , the presentation of the pdr as a collective oscillation is in principle no longer valid  @xcite .",
    "there are several microscopic calculations in literature showing that the pdr has a non - collective nature ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the major issues in the theoretical study of the pdr in medium and heavy nuclei is the discrepancy in the predictions of different approaches regarding the strength and collectivity of the pdr .",
    "for example , while the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rrpa ) seems to predict a prominent peak identified as the collective pdr below 10 mev in @xmath5sn and @xmath6zr  @xcite , the results of calculations including monopole pairing within the quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) do not expose any collective states in the low - energy region of the @xmath3 strength distribution for @xmath5sn  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible sources of such discrepancy may well lie in superfluid pairing .",
    "it is well - known that superfluid pairing plays a crucial role in open shell nuclei in the vicinity of the neutron drip line , where the neutron fermi surface is located very close to the continuum .",
    "however all the theoretical calculations of the pdr so far either neglected pairing , such as the relativistic rpa , or adopted the mean - field pairing .",
    "the latter is taken into account within the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb )  @xcite , hartree - fock ( hf ) + bcs formalisms , or coupling of qrpa particle - hole ( ph ) states to more complicate configurations like the 2p2h ones within the particle - phonon coupling scheme  @xcite or coupling to two , three phonon components  @xcite .",
    "given the progress in the exact solutions of the pairing problem in recent years  @xcite , it is highly desirable to see how exact pairing affects the pdr as compared to the predictions given by the approaches employing the conventional mean - field pairing gap .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to study the effect of exact pairing on the pdr within the phonon damping model ( pdm ) .",
    "the latter was extended to include the pairing gap and applied to calculate the pdr in oxygen and calcium isotopes in ref .",
    "@xcite . within this approach",
    "the gdr is generated by a phenomenological phonon with the unperturbed energy @xmath7 .",
    "because of coupling to ph configurations ( for closed - shell nuclei ) or two - quasiparticle configurations ( for open - shell nuclei ) , this energy is shifted to the gdr energy @xmath8 and the gdr also acquires a width @xmath9 .",
    "the pdr appears in this model as an enhancement of the strength at low energy ( below 10 - 12 mev ) in the gdr strength function . by calculating the ewss of the pdr and comparing it to the gdr energy - weighted sum rule",
    ", one can see the contribution of the pdr to the total gdr sum rule . to see the effect of exact pairing , apart from the bcs gap , which was used in the calculations in ref .",

    "these values are then kept fixed and extended to the calculations for other nuclei in the same isotopic chains . in the second parameter selection , the values for this parameter is readjusted when bcs and exact pairing are included so that the obtained gdr width remains the same as that predicted in the case without pairing .",

    "this observation indicates that bcs pairing might not be sufficient to describe the pdr in medium and heavy neutron - rich nuclei ;    \\3 ) the significant change in the line shape of the gdr with increasing the mass number a , which takes place within the calculations using parameter selection i , indicates that the values for the model s parameters can not be kept fixed when the calculations are extended to the nuclei in the vicinity of the neutron drip line .",
    "this includes the parameters of the nuclear mean field such as the parameters of the woods - saxon potential or the parameters of effective interactions such as various skyrme types , which are used in microscopic calculations of the gdr and pdr .",
    "the obtained results may serve as a hint to clarify while several microscopic approaches , mentioned in the introduction , are in disagreement regarding the strength and fine structure of the pdr .",
    "the present paper also emphasizes the necessity of using exact pairing , whenever possible , instead of the bcs one or the hfb average pairing gap in the future study of the pdr .",
    "the results of this work also demonstrates that , albeit being a semi - microscopic model with phenomenological assumptions for the parameter of gdr coupling to ph configurations , the pdm is able to give reasonable predictions for the gdr as well as pdr , which are qualitatively similar to those offered in the state - of - the - art microscopic approaches .",
    "the drawback of the pdm is that it is a simple model with phenomenological parameters ; therefore , it does not allow a quantitative study of the structure of the pdr such as its collectivity and transition densities . in order to carry out this task , the gdr phonon should be made as a collective superposition of two - quasiparticle states within a microscopic framework such as the qrpa by using some effective interaction such as the skyrme force . by solving the corresponding set of qrpa equations one can determine the structure of the gdr phonons , namely their energies and the corresponding qrpa @xmath135 and @xmath136 amplitudes",
