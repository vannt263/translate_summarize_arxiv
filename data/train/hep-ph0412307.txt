    "weak - mixing angle @xmath1 is one of the fundamental constants in the standard model .",
    "it has been measured experimentally by various methods such as atomic parity violation and polarization asymmetry in electron - positron annihilation .",
    "the nutev collaboration determined it by neutrino- and antineutrino - nucleus scattering and found that its value , @xmath2 in the on - shell scheme , is significantly larger than other measurements ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "it is called  nutev @xmath1 anomaly \" .",
    "because there may be new physics behind this anomaly , careful analyses are needed for clarifying the situation . in our work",
    ", we investigate a conservative explanation without exotic mechanisms .",
    "the nutev target is iron , so that nuclear corrections could be a candidate for the anomalous result .",
    "there are various factors including the effects of neutron excess , strange - antistrange asymmetry , isospin violation , and modification of valence - quark distributions . among them ,",
    "the nuclear modification difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is discussed in this paper .",
    "it was first investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and a detailed analysis has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we report recent analysis results .",
    "this paper consists of the following . in section [ analysis ] ,",
    "our analysis method and results are explained for determining the nuclear modification difference . its effect on @xmath1",
    "is calculated in section [ sinth ] .",
    "the results are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "it is known that nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are modified from those of the nucleonic distributions .",
    "such nuclear modifications have been investigated especially in the structure function @xmath0 .",
    "determination of each parton modification is not straightforward from @xmath0 and drell - yan data .",
    "however , gross features of nuclear pdfs are now determined , for example , in ref . @xcite . among the nuclear pdf corrections ,",
    "it was pointed out that valence - quark modifications affect the @xmath1 determination @xcite .    in order to discuss such a nuclear effect ,",
    "we define nuclear modification factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 for up- and down - valence quark distributions by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the distributions in the nucleon , @xmath11 is the atomic number of a nucleus , and @xmath12 is the mass number . for simplicity",
    ", the @xmath13 dependence is abbreviated .",
    "it should be noticed that these relations are used at any @xmath13 for the present research , although similar equations are defined only at @xmath13=1 gev@xmath14 in ref .",
    "these equations are motived by the following considerations .",
    "if there were no nuclear correction , the @xmath4 distribution of a nucleus is given by the simple summation of proton and neutron contributions @xmath15 .",
    "the isospin symmetry is usually assumed for the parton distributions , so that it becomes @xmath16 .",
    "it is divided by @xmath12 ( @xmath17 ) because we use nuclear pdfs per nucleon .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath6 indicates nuclear correction to this distribution",
    ".    in particular , we are interested in the modification difference @xmath18 and its effect on the @xmath1 determination .",
    "therefore , specific parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) are assigned for the difference at @xmath13=1 gev@xmath14 @xcite : @xmath23 because of the baryon - number and charge conservations , the parameter @xmath19 is fixed , and then the number of parameters is three . the parameter @xmath24 and other parameters in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27",
    "are fixed at the values of our recent analysis @xcite .",
    "the mass - number dependence is assumed in the @xmath28 form simply by considering nuclear volume and surface contributions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 dependence is motivated by the shape of nuclear modification data of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we should aware that appropriate @xmath12 and @xmath29 dependence is not known almost at all for @xmath30 .",
    "is shown at @xmath13=20 gev@xmath14 @xcite with previous results @xcite",
    ". the details are explained in the text.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    [ fig : epsv ]    we determined the parameters by using experimental data for the nuclear @xmath0 ratios and drell - yan cross - section ratios as investigated in ref .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are optimized by a @xmath31 analysis with the data .",
    "the obtained distribution is shown by the ratio @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsv ] . equation ( [ eqn : ev ] ) is used at any @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution @xmath33 is shown by the solid curve , and the shaded area indicates the one-@xmath34 error range .",
    "the error is estimated by the hessian method by using the determined parameters and error matrix in the @xmath31 analysis . the distribution is shown at @xmath13=20 gev@xmath14 which is about the average @xmath13 value of the nutev data .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves indicate the estimated distributions in ref .",
    "the dashed curve is obtained by calculating @xmath35 $ ] , which is one of the candidates for satisfying the baryon - number and charge conservations . the function @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the dotted is obtained by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ev ] ) with the 2001 version of the nuclear pdfs @xcite . as obvious from the figure ,",
    "three distributions are much different .",
    "however , they are well within the error band , which indicates that these results are consistent each other .",
    "from the neutrino- and antineutrino - nucleon scattering , @xmath1 could be obtained by using the paschos - wolfenstein ( pw ) relation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) cross sections .",
    "there are various nuclear corrections to the pw relation . expanding the expression in terms of the correction factors ,",
    "we obtain a modified pw relation for a nucleus @xcite : @xmath41 the first correction term with @xmath33 is investigated in this paper .",
    "in addition , there are corrections associated with the neutron - excess ( @xmath42 ) , strange - antistrange asymmetry ( @xmath43 ) , and charm - anticharm asymmetry ( @xmath44 ) factors .",
    "the variable @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 with the energy transfer @xmath47 .    because the @xmath48 correction term depends on the variables @xmath29 , @xmath45 , and @xmath13",
    ", we need to take the nutev kinematics into account to estimate an effect on the @xmath1 determination . in particular , there are few experimental data in the large @xmath29 region , where the distribution @xmath33 becomes significant as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsv ] .",
    "namely , the @xmath48 effect on @xmath1 could be much smaller than the one expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : epsv ] .",
    "fortunately , such kinematical factors are supplied in ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing our pdf definition with the nutev one",
    ", we find the relations @xmath49 where the asterisk ( @xmath50 ) indicates the nutev distributions .",
    "therefore , the nuclear modification difference @xmath48 corresponds to the isospin violation in the nutev terminology .",
    "then , the contribution to the nutev @xmath1 is given by @xmath51 \\",

    "our sign convention of @xmath54 is opposite to the nutev one in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : del - sinth ] ) .",
    "the distributions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are calculated by eq .",

    ", we obtain @xcite @xmath57 at @xmath13=20 gev@xmath14 .    in comparison with the nutev deviation @xmath58 , the correction is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "however , the error becomes comparable to the deviation .",
    "the magnitude of the error depends much on the analysis condition .",
    "therefore , careful analyses could alter the values in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : effect ] ) .",
    "in particular , the nuclear modification difference @xmath30 , which we have investigated in this paper , is not a uniquely determined quantity at this stage . in order to determine this difference",

    "we have analyzed the experimental data on nuclear structure functions @xmath59 and drell - yan cross sections for extracting the nuclear modification difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions . using the obtained distribution",
    ", we investigated its effect on the nutev @xmath1 determination .",
    "we found a rather small effect ; however , the uncertainty on the @xmath1 is not small in comparison with the nutev deviation .",
    "because such as nuclear modification is difficult to be determined at this stage , we need further studies to pin down the modification .",
